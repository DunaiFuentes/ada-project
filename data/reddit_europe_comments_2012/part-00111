Personally, about 20 years ago I've made a decision which drugs I'd take and which I'd stay away from. But who am I to judge somebody who has made different decisions? So, if I'm with people who do, say, amphetamines, I politely decline. With very rare exceptions of young people I actually care about, I'm not even going to comment on it, because frankly I just don't give a fuck. Same with dealers. If I'm buying a black market substance off somebody, I can hardly blame that person for selling other black market substances.

The point is, because it's so extremely common and widely accepted, pot creates a fertile environment for other drugs to spread. If somebody's into speed, odds are the potheads he just met on that party won't mind if he does a line, and it's only polite offer some. Similarly, your dealer probably won't be too insulted if you ask about other drugs, and the distribution network he's ultimately a part of works just as well for other drugs as it does for weed, with all the mutual trust the participants have built up over time.

The UK is a country run for and by the elite; the proles know their place and get on with it- with little to no resistance as long as they are entertained- it's the same policy that Josef Goebbels invented for the Third Reich- keep them entertained, slip the message in subtly, and they won't revolt. The trick is working out where the path of least resistance lies. That's the only difference between our political parties. They'll push their own agenda as far as they can until it encounters an obstacle.

The biggest lie that we have swallowed in this country- outside of religion although the two can sometimes go hand-in-hand- is that politics is boring and somehow irrelevant. That's bullshit and by swallowing that lie we've left the decisions which fundamentally affect every resident in the UK to a handful of unrepresentative wankers. 

The second biggest lie is that politicians are worried about the lack of interest in politics and want to do something about it. If it happened that the British people took a strong interest in the decisions which directly and indirectly affect them, then all of our elected representatives would be out of office and most, from Parish Councillors to Members of Parliament would be in gaol.

&gt;This has nothing to do with the USA. The Egyptians were failed asylum seekers who were being deported back to Egypt. Usually a standard practice but in this case they were thought to have Al Qaida links - given that this was right after 9/11 the CIA ended up getting involved in cooperation with the Egyptian government. Sweden does not allow deportation if the people involved would be likely to be subjected to torture - the Swedish government received a written promise from the Egyptians saying torture wouldn't occur but it was later determined it should have been obvious that this was not a trustworthy promise. This story caused a huge storm in Sweden and the men were later awarded compensation. The woman who was ultimately at fault for this (our Foreign Minister) was murdered though so no one really ended up being held accountable. I'm sure she would have if she'd lived though - the government has a good history of holding such people accountable for any wrongdoings. Point is that Sweden violated the torture ban in this case - the only time we ever have. The USA does not factor into this (aside from the disturbing fact that they use torture techniques abroad).

If you turn up in a dress looking like [this- reasonably SFW](http://cdn2.pornstarblognetwork.com/www.ladyboybenz.com//wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Ladyboy-Benz-Dress-0.jpg) but your photo ID says that you are [male- most definitely NSFW](http://ladyboy-lover.asianlb.com/resources/images/ladyboy_benz_shoots_massive_stream_of_cum_1.jpg)- then that's where the discrepancy applies. 

I doubt that in the examples I've shown most doorstaff would try to double-check, but there's a pressure on them not to be taken in by fake photo ID- and if the gender on the ID doesn't obviously match that of the would-be patron, then they'll want to make further enquiries. It's extremely unlikely- at least in my experience- that would involve examination of genitalia, however it still represents major inconvenience to the person wishing entry to the establishment.

Yes, he is. If he had been offered the option to change his sex to female through surgery at no cost, would he say yes? If yes, then she is and should be considered a woman, even before surgery. It's ridiculously downgrading, hurtful and insulting to call her by masculine pronouns if the above is true.

Ask any transgender person.

Not to mention that there are many kinds of people. A relatively macho man who goes through surgery or would like to go through surgery (but doesn't have the money, haven't gone through therapy yet, etc.) to become a woman and keeps being ""macho"" (though he would be labelled as ""butch"" I suppose) is still a woman.

I am completely baffled as to how in a world with 7 million people (over a billion muslims), upon three negative encounters with muslims, the entire group is stereotyped in your mind.

The point is moot though. Even if 99% of muslims run across you and beat you up every single time, you should still treat people like people. That's how our society works. We don't treat individuals as walking representatives of their race. We don't arrest black people because statistically they are more likely to be criminals. People are individuals, and it's fucked up to determine what a person is like without knowing anything about them.

The reason due process and a fair trial are basic rights is so that you can put people on a plane knowing that if they're innocent, they will be found as such, and released.

Berlin / Hamburg / Düsseldorf / Cologne would be my choices.

About the payment, it really does depend if you are going to be independent or working for someone.

If you are working for someone I guess it should be between 1800 - 2400 € (before Tax).

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"What they want is that providers must offer a flat-rate plan that includes all calls and data within all of the EU, for €50.

Of course this would be great (assuming decent bandwidth for the data plan, a detail they forgot to include). An EU wide rail pass for €50 would be great as well. Or -- dude! -- a €50 EU wide hotel flat rate. That would be awesome! Let's start petitions for those.

That's not how it works. Network operators have very different costs, depending on how wide and dense their network is, and how many people use it. Why would a provider invest into LTE if they could only charge as much as all the other providers, anyway? And no, it doesn't balance itself out. Population density aside, there simply are more Germans travelling to Malta than the other way round. And why shouldn't I buy my plan from a Matese provider if it costs the same, anyway? Would this mean that here in Germany I'd be on one of the two networks that are expensive but have very good coverage, one the cheap one that has holes in it, or on the compromise one?

Edit: The downvotes tell me I'm not explaining this well enough. Let's try this again:

A phone call doesn't cost your network provider anything. It's not how it used to be, when phone calls caused physical wear and tear in the switching stations. Covering an area with enough cell towers to handle peak usage times (plus servicing them, renting their location and bandwidth to connect them etc.) is what causes the cost, whether this network just sits there or is used at its limit makes (almost) no difference at all.  

The question is now how to divide this cost between customers. Some hardly make any calls at all, most don't even use data. For them, €50 would be way more than they pay today, even if they don't roam into other countries at all. For others, a €50 flat rate for all of the EU would be great. Hell, truly unlimited calls and *data* (without throttling) for €50 would be great in most places. Now imagine what happens to that Maltese cellphone network when hordes of German tourists can make video calls to their loved ones on Mallorca for free. How many extra towers would that poor Matese provider have to built to handle this additional traffic, and who's going to pay for it? Its Maltese customers get the same €50 deal, and it would be unfair if they had to pay for it, anyway.

You'll probably say that the tourists' German providers should pay for it, and you'd be right. But how much is that? We have already established that the marginal cost of one phone call is zero. The cost for the Matese operator is whatever it costs to maintain a denser network to handle the additional load during tourist season, and how much this is is directly linked to the prices consumers have to pay. The EU's current approach is to fix those and regularly move them downwards. But with a flat fee, the Maltese operator would have to multiply its current capacity to handle the traffic during tourist season, because tourists would make video calls from the beach, stream music and movies, and keep twittering their latest vacation pictures. It's not even just a cost thing, the bandwidth simply isn't there with current technology.

Edit II: I forgot to point out that in my hotel and train flat-rate example, the marginal cost is negligible as well, and both have limited capacities that cause cost to maintain and operate.",0,1345628218,null,0,1345638147,0,c5wye95,t3_ymmrn,t1_c5wye95,t3_ymmrn,null,1429704580,8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,8

If you're qualified for these kind of jobs and have 10 years relevant job experience you might as well be able to pull a job that pays 60-80k€ a year. maybe even more.

At most, a one-stop-shop might shorten the time and effort wasted by the buyer to set him/herself up the way they intended in the first place. Perhaps some ppl end up buying when they would have given up otherwise then. But I've not noticed ppl easily giving up on more drugs if they wish them.

Of course the local infrastructure needs maintaining, and the calls made in Malta need to pay the bills for the Maltese operators. So the Maltese operators cross-charge the Germans.

If you are charged for roaming, you are really being charged for not using your local phone company's infrastructure. 

Consider a world where there are no longer country prefixes for calls inside EU, and phone number mobility is universal and instaneous (or takes 5 minutes or whatever). And surprise - this is what effectively already happens now, except that instead of getting multiple bills from several providers if you visited another EU country, you get just one bill from your provider.

• WWII No go expect they bring it up. (All americans ask bout that...)
• Last name best choice, because some people might think you are rude or do not respect them...
• Do NEVER EVER call a German a Nazi... I would till the hell out if someone does it (cuz most of them dont know whats behind the story)...
• Compliments are good, but only if they are really ment
something like ""you look so good"" and she is a fat girl... doesent work out good...

true,Yohuatzinco,NORW,Norway,"&gt; Yes, but gender is also a biological designation, you can't just say I'm a man in a woman's body and expect everyone to see you as a man or vice versa.

No. Sex is the biological designation. Gender is what you are mentally (and consider yourself as).

And no you can't expect that, but that's not because it's scientifically wrong or whatever; that's because society hasn't come to respect and accept genderqueer individuals yet. Sure, I can see why some people might find it weird to call someone with a deep voice a ""she,"" and that they might never be able to see them as a female. It's sad as hell, but I can see why it happens.

&gt; I can see myself as black, white or east Asian but that doesn't change the reality that I'm Indian.

That is irrelevant, and not the same issue at all. That said, what about people who are Indian (in that their parents were born/lived there), but were born in the US or Norway or something? Are they Indian or American/Norwegian? If yes, why? Surely they're Indian, considering their parents were born there. If no, why? Because they look different from your average American or Norwegian or whatever?

&gt; However, I still don't see the logic of how a person with perfectly functional male genitalia and no sign of any female anatomy is a woman.

I don't know you, but... It seems like you're not aware (well, how could you be) of what it feels like that your body just isn't *right*, somehow. That there's something wrong, like a disconnection between your behaviour/what you want to look like (but generally aren't allowed to because of society; this mostly applies to biological males)/what you want to be seen as and what you actually are, physically.

Being called by the wrong pronoun makes you feel really fucking strange, out of place. Being forced to consider yourself what's the wrong gender for you because of society's norms, having to check the box for ""Miss""/""Mrs""/""Mr"" when it doesn't *feel correct*. Yeah. It's just a terrible, isolating feeling, especially because you can't talk to a lot of people about it for fear of alienation.

Le Parti pirate est souvent idiot. Dans mon coin de France, on ne les voit jamais aux différents événements libristes/hackers/etc., sauf – miracle ! – pendant la campagne pour les législatives. Et ils ont essayé de poser une question lors d'une discussion entre Zimmermann, Bayart et Tetaneutral dont l'unique but était de recentrer le débat sur leur Parti. La réponse a été unanime : un parti politique sert à faire de la politique, à savoir servir des ambitions personnelles et non une idéologie, tout en se réfugiant derrière cette dernière. Bayart est resté cool avec eux (malgré des réflexions du genre « Je connais mieux les procédures parlementaires que vous » (qui pour en douter ?)), tandis que Zimmermann a allègrement *bashé* (notamment en racontant l'histoire d'une MEP qui a été laissée à la rue par son parti jusqu'au jour où, élu, ledit PP lui a demandé de participer financièrement avec son salaire de MEP).

Other thoughts about the article:
#7 is BS IMHO. Germans *are* aware that their stance towards patriotism is a little bit special, so wearing e.g. a flag pin will not be held against you most of the time. #9 is a different story. Germans are proud of a lot of things (engineering, beer, the autobahn). So talking shit about those things will not be appreciated (but this applies to most countries, I guess).

#8: Not really *that* of an issue unless you don't give that ""germans=nazis"" stereotype or yell ""Sieg Heil"" as a joke (which can get you into legal trouble as well). Just use some common sense and you are good.

#10: partially true: compliments are a rare thing in Germany, but are appreciated.

#11: true. Driving is serious business in Germany. Proof: Germans will rant an unlimited amount of time about people clogging the left lane on the autobahn while driving at lower speeds: passing right of a vehicle is *verboten*, so this basically limits the speed of the vehicles behind those slow cars.

Perhaps saying anything is gateway is rather short sighted. it is far more likely that people who are going to experiment, will experiment. the first thing most people start with though is alcohol.

By that I mean that it isnt the drug (it never is) that is being gateway, it is the person who is experimenting. I dont believe that any drug is inherently bad, because it is always the person who makes the decision, not the drug. 

We need to teach moderation rather than prohibition, because experimenter gonna experiment. I admit it is hard to be moderate with crack, meth or heroin, but it is better that it is taught that moderation is important, than ""It will kill you straight away and ruin your life"" because for a good while, it wont. this period of ""Its not as bad as I was taught, so I will carry on"" is what leads to addiction.

true,thisismycle,null,null,"American here. I spent a year studying in a small town near Hamburg during college. Some things that I learned over the course of that year may help you:

1. To be honest, I found most Germans to be extremely friendly. Go ahead, smile, say Hallo, Guten Tag, and Guten Morgen. I can't remember a time where I didn't get a smile and the same response back.

2. Use your German as much as possible. I don't care if it sucks. If you know a little bit and you at least try, I am certain you will have a much better time. People will admire you for trying.

3. That being said...most people will respond in English. Why wouldn't they? They aren't trying to say your German sucks. They are just trying to help you out by talking back in your native tongue. Also, they get the chance to practice their English.

4. Get used to the staring. This was something odd that a lot of my American colleagues noticed. Germans stare. It is not offensive or rude, it just how it is. If someone is looking at you on the bus, and when you look back at them and they don't turn away...don't read much into it.

5. Germans can be blunt and more willing to talk about things that we in America try to avoid in regular polite conversation. I was once in a bar and a German girl overheard me speaking English to one of my friends. She came over and dragged me outside so she could ask me about American politics. Every other German standing outside overheard our conversation and had tons of questions about 9/11 to Bush, etc. Pretty sure everyone was drunk...so you could take this one with a grain of salt ;)

6. Tipping...so this is a strange thing in Germany. You don't really tip, but you do...so for example if you buy lunch for 5,50 you would typically round up to 6. But what if you have great service and the waiter was awesome? I would usually throw in another euro or so...nothing extreme. I could be completely wrong on this one, so maybe a German could explain tipping in a more modern context. It may have just made sense to someone like me since I was visiting the same places over and over. Got great service, free shots, etc.

7. Pretty much everything shuts down on Sunday. Have to grocery shopping? Get it done before Sunday. Need some clothes? Get them before Sunday. Some gas stations will be open, and loads of restaurants are too, but Sunday is a relatively quiet day.

8. Pay in cash. Some places will allow you to use a credit card (hotels, hostels, airlines, etc.), but just use cash. Having a debit card with an international pin works fine in pretty much any ATM (best exchange rates too!).

9. Make sure to bring some change for the public bathrooms. Even bathrooms in places like Burger King have an attendant. They keep the places clean...they aren't there to dry your hands or give you some cologne. Some will accept anything, a lot of them ask for 50 cents. If you need to find a bathroom, look for ""WC"", stands for water closet.

10. Carry a water bottle around with you. I drink a lot of water, and it was tough in those first few weeks not having easy access to tap water. Restaurants will serve you tap water, but most serve the bubbly mineral water. I had no problem asking for it, but one waiter did look at me in disgust and tell me that ""tap water is for the dogs"". EDIT 2: After reading this over one of the replies to this post, I just wanted to clarify this a bit. Waiter that said ""tap water is for the dogs"" was joking...I think...I, at the very least, laughed. :) Tap water is always free though, you do have to ask for specifically. Otherwise, you will get mineral water that you will have to pay for. Also, whenever I ordered tap water, it usually came in a smaller (breakfast juice sized) glass. Confused? Order beer!

11. Eat döner (opt for the box or the tüte) and currywurst. Just do it.

12. Ride a bike! Bike paths everywhere. If you can rent a bike, do it. I really regret that I didn't buy a bike when I was there. 

13. Use public transportation. This depends on where you are staying, but I never had a problem navigating the buses, trains, subways, or trolleys. http://www.bahn.de will help you (you can even view the site in English).

EDIT 1: Oh and about clothes...try to dress like you are German. I wouldn't wear bright white tennis shoes or flip flops. Wear jeans. Shirts with no extreme logos/designs. I found it more fun to blend in.

true,simonask,DENK,Denmark,"I don't doubt that this pattern exists and is very prevalent. But there are a few very important questions that we must ask ourselves:

1. Why does it exist? Is it biologically the case that women are less interested in sex than men, or are women taught from a young age that they shouldn't be interested in sex, and men taught that they should be? All research that I've come across suggests that women are exactly as horny as men on average, so what compels men to live out their desires more openly?

2. Are there people who don't fit this pattern, and is the pattern a problem for them? The obvious answer is ""yes"", there are women who are interested in sex, but feel compelled to suppress their desires, and there are men who act in response to peer pressure more than actual desire (I realize the distinction isn't always that clear-cut, but let's pretend that it is for the sake of simplicity).

3. Are the patterns hurting people in indirect ways, for example by enforcing negative behavioral stereotypes? For example, is the idea that men are always interested in sex above anything else contributing to the extreme prejudice that many men have faced in situations where they deal with children? Is the idea that women should not be interested in sex contributing to discrimination of women who live out their desires more openly?

Die Reddit Nazis, also die OPs dieses Subs, entscheiden was in r/de akzeptabel ist. Das machen die Nazis jetzt seit 2-3 Jahren soweit ich das verfolgen konnte. 
Resultat: 20 Submissions pro Tag in r/de und davon werden maximal 2 nicht sofort in Koma gevotet. Das kann man als vollständiges Versagen der OPs bezeichnen.

Heute z.B. ist ein Link zu dem todlangweiligen Spiegel Artikel ""IEKA baut einen Stadtteil"" die Einreichung mit den meisten Votes.

&gt; Quello che dico è che se uno facesse una associazione in cui vende ""pietre taumaturgiche"" ai creduloni, tipo la vanna marchi, e con parte del ricavato aiuta i bambini poveri, non lo rende un santo.

Mettere la chiesa sullo stesso livello di queste cose pero' e' un po' estremo, posso capire il ragionamento pero' potrai concedermi che non e' proprio la stessa cosa. Durante i secoli praticamente tutti i filosofi o pensatori si sono chiesti il significato della vita e il cattolicesimo, come altre religioni, fornisce una risposta che tanta gente accetta -piu' per speranza che per effettivo convicimento suppongo- . Non giustifico ne' i soldi che la chiesa possiede ne' molti utilizzi che ne fa' ma paragonare cosi' brutalmente Vanna Marchi e la chiesa mi sembra un po' eccessivo (e' un'argomentazione che in molti usano e non l'ho mai condivisa).

&gt; Per di più, ci sono un sacco di associazioni che fanno simili attività, come l'assistenza oncologica a domicilio, l'UNIVoC (Volontariato per Ciechi), e un mare di altre onlus che vedono sicuramente meno soldi

Non ho mai detto che queste associazioni non debbano usufruire dei soldi dell'8 per mille, anzi, sarei contento se ne avessero di piu' anche loro (tra l'altro si occupano di ambiti decisamente diversi da quelli della chiesa quindi non vedo molto il nesso). E ripeto, i preti di paese con quei soldi fanno cose egregie almeno dalle mie parti. Ad esempio, non ci sono molte associazioni che cercano di integrare *veramente* gli immigrati aiutandoli nella ricerca di una dimora e di un lavoro e facendogli conoscere la cultura nella quale sono proiettati, dalle mie parti -purtroppo- l'unico a cui ho visto fare qualcosa di utile e' stato per l'appunto il prete. Tutti gli altri (soprattutto quelli di una certa appartenenza politica) non fanno nient'altro che *utilissime* serate di informazione nel quale proiettano filmati *molto* significativi e stimolano *interessantissimi* dibattiti fini a se' stessi e che sicuramente non ti fanno mangiare. Il prete, dal canto suo, ha messo a disposizione un intero convento per le famiglie (15 anni fa, ora si sono trasferiti tutti, sempre grazie al suo aiuto) e si e' messo in contatto con le aziende del posto per dargli almeno un lavoro che permetta di comprare i beni primari.

In fin dei conti, credo che sia io che te la pensiamo piu' o meno nello stesso modo per quanto riguarda la distinzione tra chiesa ""di palazzo"" e ""di paese"", io non volevo fare il cavaliere templare a difesa dei sacri valori della fede ma solamente far notare che la frase dal quale e' scaturito tutto questo dibattito era una emerita cazzata guidata dal pensiero ggggiovane e trpp rivoluxionariovivailche-alrogoipreti che vuole che tutto quello che riguardi i preti sia spazzatura corrotta.

Major flaws in the study: 

- assuming that wealth is evenly spread in states

- assuming that states are populated with a homogenous ethnicity

- assuming that a correlation between these questionable variables proves their point, instead of a myriad other possible explanations like climate, politics, culture or simply the reverse explanation: richer countries can afford to invest more in education.

- a failure to explain historical changes over time

All in all, the study is not one that should have some minor corrections, but proves nothing at all. So try again for a small region over a limited period of time and after that we'll see how far you can stretch those conclusions.

ok. Allora confrontiamo con damanhur ? o con scientology ? L'unica differenza sono 2000 anni (4000 se includi anche la storia e la filosofia pre-cristiana) di elaborazioni in un certo framework. Ma questo tipo di elaborazioni possono derivare a prescindere dal misticismo.


&gt; Durante i secoli praticamente tutti i filosofi o pensatori si sono chiesti il significato della vita e il cattolicesimo, come altre religioni, fornisce una risposta che tanta gente accetta -piu' per speranza che per effettivo convicimento suppongo-

La accetta perchè gli viene detto di accettarla. Se fosse nata in cina accetterebbe i dettami di Confucio o del Tao te ching, o di buddha. Per di più, quando a tali domande viene data una risposta vera e verificabile, la si rifiuta. Quindi non è la ricerca di una risposta, è l'aderenza a qualcosa a tutti i costi, a prescindere che sia vera o no.

&gt; paragonare cosi' brutalmente Vanna Marchi e la chiesa mi sembra un po' eccessivo (e' un'argomentazione che in molti usano e non l'ho mai condivisa).

Dovresti studiare un po' di storia. La chiesa ha sfruttato presunti miracoli (e continua a farlo, in altre parti del mondo) per motivi economici. Dalle indulgenze ai vari gesù che piangono, alle possessioni demoniache e al peccato originale del quale siamo tutti afflitti. Ripeto, il framework filosofico è separato dal misticismo. Se uno mi parlasse di _filosofia_ cristiana, posso supportare il sistema, perchè dà adito a critica, revisione, e nessun falso misticismo. Religione no. La religione sfrutta il misticismo per spingere a forza una filosofia non-revisionabile, opporsi a tali revisioni in modo spesso brutale, e tenere il popolo sotto controllo attraverso intimidazione e ignoranza.

Questo perchè viviamo in un paese incivile e mi meraviglio che il prete debba fare una cosa del genere.

Questo in una delle nazioni più atee del mondo (ma non implico nessuna correlazione, dico solo che il prete riempie una mancanza che uno Stato autentico dovrebbe rendere possibile, dato che ha fatto entrare quella gente e gli fa pagare le tasse, e come tale deve fornirgli un servizio).

No, e' la speranza di qualcosa (come ho scritto prima, anche questo). Purtroppo nella nostra societa' c'e' paura della morte, fatto anche comprensibile da un certo punto di vista, e non si ha la certezza delle nostre origini (da dove arriviamo? dove andiamo? perche' riusciamo a formulare pensieri?). A queste domande alcuni preferiscono cercare risposte scientifiche (bada bene, io sono uno di questi), altri invece si danno al misticismo.

Questa e' un'uscita proprio da stronzo, passami il termine. Chi ti dice che io non abbia studiato? Chi cazzo ha parlato del passato soprattutto prima di questo intervento? Io ho parlato dell'utilita' sociale che possono avere i preti. Introltre, tra Vanna Marchi e la chiesa c'e' differenza. Almeno per quanto la chiesa ha fatto o comunque stimolato (arte, letteratura, comunita', solidarieta' etc. etc.. Lo stesso vale per scientology e altre religioni ""nuove"").

La stesso discorso allora vale anche per le associazioni che tu hai portato come esempio. In uno stato perfetto non dovrebbero esistere in quanto servizi gia' forniti, non trovi? Purtroppo il nostro stato e' quello che e' e di conseguenza abbiamo necessita' di ""aiutarci tra di noi"".

Thus, sex is inherently more dangerous for women, think childbirth etc.

Also sex is emotionally more dangerous for women. Think all the discussions of rape. If a woman wakes up and she is told someone had sex with her while she slept she will be emotionally very scared. If a guy wakes up and is told he was mounted by a woman while he slept he will laugh it away or even feel proud.

I don't know whether it is biological, although the concept of parental invesment and the deadly danger of childbirth in pre-modern times surely does play a role. 

But probably there are also social effects too, of course girls are normally brought up differently as boys. 

And thirdly there is always the philosophical-psychological aspect. The penetrator is always more in a position of power than the penetrated, thus the penetrated always has more reasons to be a bit cautious. I think this must be the same even amongst same-sex couples, being top or bottom or whatever is the term matters. I think a gay man too would be more picky about who gets put his dick in him than in whom he puts his dick. 

As for 2), yes, there are always outliers. I am in fact one. I deeply needed a GF all my life but not really for sex but more like for validation, acceptance. 

However the proper personal solution for this is to avoid the whole clubbing scene. We should see clubbing as a subset of society, a subculture, not the normal way for everybody to spend a Saturday night. And not only for these issues. In fact the biggest issue is that in clubs only those people have chances who hobby and passion is to look as good as possible, and invest all their energies into it. A normal, average looking person doesn't score because clubs are all looks and grinding and little to no talk. A person who does not want to invest incredible energy into getting the right body shape, clothes, hair should try to pair off somewhere else than clubs.

Now, outside this narcissisitic clubbing culture, I think the peer pressure for this is much less. Like a normal university environment.  Shy boys are more accepted. I am not sure if un-shy women are more accepted though... this may be a problem. I dunno, really. 

The children problem: may be related but IMHO not really much. I think the problem is elsewhere, the modern myth (or reality?) copied from horror movies, assuming people to be psychos. 50 years ago being a peeping tom in a female changing room was considered naughty, now it is creepy and the subtext is that people who watch others naked without their knowledge maybe some kind of mass murderer rapist psychos. I blame it on horror movies but maybe it is real. But anyway, I think this is the major problem, that a man around a child is not simply assumed to be a pedo because people think men always do everything for sex but it triggers the creepy mass murderer rapist psycho thriller horror way of thinking. But again maybe this is just a symptom of something deeper. There must be something in society that made the Hitchcock - Psycho way of looking at people normal. There must be in society that makes people think that Jack the Ripper is no longer a very rare phenomenon but everybody may be one. Perhaps alienation?

As for women with higher sex drives, frankly, I am less sympathetic, because I think on the whole both sexes should have fairly lower ones than what is accepted in the clubbing scene for men. I think it is uncivilized to be a hedonist. Having a subculture for horny men like clubs is OK, and we should have the same for horny women (perhaps Chippendale?) but keep it out of what is generally respected in mainstream society, both should be somewhat marginal. 

Finally, about feminism: the problem with feminism that is not about such thoughtful ideas and discussions we have here. Feminism is a liberal-leftist philosophy and therefore does not ask questions but already knows the answer: everything is reducible to a dynamic of oppressors vs. the oppressed. And this is, of course, stupid and simplistic. This is why I would not research gender issues in a feminist way because the feminist way is by definition not a research, just reaffirming existing intellectual prejudices of the every-inequality-is-oppressive kind...",0,1345651163,null,0,false,0,c5x2au9,t3_ylk0k,t1_c5x2au9,t1_c5x0wvx,null,1435689617,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,[deleted],null,null,"This looks very strange to me... the Berlin programmer with the €450 that really sounds like not a creative job but something repetitive, trained-monkey stuff... like even below the support people.

When I worked in the UK, the support people ranked lowest, then the consultants/analysists who can configure software but not change it, and the programmers highest because they know the magic stuff others don't. I mean they were even a little bit... feared. Like wizards with dangerous knowledge.

This is what I wrote above that German-speaking countries (Austria too) have this rather old-fashioned approach that it is just electronic data processing, so even a good programmer is just a Techniker, comparable to a car mechanic. Without a degree I mean but often with it too. I actually worked at a company like that in Austria. While people from English-speaking, Eastern European, of Francophone cultures buy more into the ""expert"" or the ""cowboy wizard"" narrative of programming, I actually work at a mostly Francophone company in Austria that regards me a bit like a wizard and not for my fairly good degree (bachelor + postgraduate certificate in strategic IT) but for being able to understand this magic thingie in the computer they don't. While for example we had an employee with a doctorate in law speaking 3 languages and he was not much respected because his job was not seen magic, but something normal that thousands of people get taught every year to do.

Perhaps it boils down to the German habit of promoting top Technikers to management positions as opposed to the habit of promoting MBA people to management positions. I think it may be common in Germany that managers can do everything their employees can. I have heard this was for a long time SAP's problem, they put top programmers in top management and it resulted in a good product but they did not understand MBA stuff like corporate strategy properly...

This is very interesting topic because I think if this could be researched, I mean these cultural differences, these should be very helpful for a lot of people. 

Are you interested in researching it?

As far as your statement ""Well... Nantes was regularly above Lens... Let's not compare these two teams!"", I have to disagree.

Between the 91/92 and 99/00 seasons:

* Both Lens and Nantes won the title once during those years.

* Lens finished above Nantes 5 times compared to Nantes finishing above Lens 4 times. Nantes was better in the early 90s while Lens was better in late 90s.

* On average Lens and Nantes were very similar in the 90s with a slight edge to Nantes I would say so i think it's fair to compare the 2.

I read, that a lot of the posters here wrote, that you need degrees and certificates and stuff...

While it's true, that they do help in most cases I know of several personnel managers, that they are fed up of people, that have their perfect degrees, studied abroad, did five internship and are 26.
My mother teaches staff managers in rethoric and she also said, that the requirements for jobs change.

Companys start looking for people who actually lived, know who they are and can care for themselves. I would guess that if you can communicate to a potentiall employee that you have all the required skills and you can proof that you had a good going company, your chances won't be that bad.

Me myself, I am self employeed and I think that if you are good at s.th. and you know the market, you can allways get a good business going. Why not in germany (where I live).

As allways the first steps might be the hardest, but after one or two years you'll get to know people and with those there will come other job opportunitys when you are good at what you're doing.

I live in Bonn, which is next to Cologne. I think it's a wonderfull place.
Feel free to visit and I'll show you around ;)

You don't see the difference between willfully mutilating someone, or trying to pass on cultural values? So you don't see the difference between for example cutting of a part of a person, or celebrating Hanukkah? I honestly don't even understand your logic, mutilating someone is irreversible.

For one, even if one is raised Christian, Buddhist, whatever, one can, oneself, make up ones mind and change that is one gets older.

Mutilating someone isn't something you can change, whether you reject the religion/culture or not later on in life.

We all get scarred, one way or another, from our childhood. Most parents, no matter the background try not to, but it happens since they are human. That is *wastly* different from *willfully* mutilating someone, and I think you are making a huge logical fallacy by equalising childhood scars (which may or may not be from religion, my parents were atheist, but had a bad divorce) with *on purpose* making sure that little boys will never have the full experience of sex as grown men, that other little boys have. 

That you equalise the two is beyond, me

And I haven't even started with the fact that only little boys (in Judaism/Islam) get mutilated, and girls in Islam/Christianity/other religions get mutilated.

mah, la morte è solo uno, a mio parere neanche tanto determinante fattore che determina la questione. Dal punto di vista tecnico, per un cristiano, morire ti porta in paradiso a contatto con dio, ergo secondo questa logica qualsiasi cristiano vorrebbe morire al più presto, e dovrebbe gioire del fatto che un parente muoia, non rattristarsene. Se poi consideriamo religioni quali quella musulmana in cui morire per il proprio credo è considerato un valore... Nota che questo è scritto sul corano (che è stato scritto da un militare, non dimentichiamolo) ma non è unico alla religione musulmana. Le religioni nordiche avevano concetti simili. Insomma la religione come speranza a scacciare la morte non regge, o regge poco.

&gt; fatto anche comprensibile da un certo punto di vista, e non si ha la certezza delle nostre origini (da dove arriviamo? dove andiamo? perche' riusciamo a formulare pensieri?). A queste domande alcuni preferiscono cercare risposte scientifiche (bada bene, io sono uno di questi), altri invece si danno al misticismo.

Le risposte a queste domande ci sono, con certe approssimazioni e lacune, ma abbiamo un'immagine relativamente consistente. Oggi non considereremmo accettabile se uno cercasse risposte mistiche nei terremoti, o nelle stelle cadenti, o nell'albinismo. Perchè dovremmo considerare accettabili per cose che, come le precedenti, consideriamo relativamente chiare in generale (anche se ancora non sappiamo i meccanismi negli intimi dettagli). Arriviamo da una molecola replicatore che è stata selezionata attraverso selezione naturale. Andiamo verso ulteriore selezione, ulteriori cambiamenti, fino a quando il nostro sole diventerà una gigante rossa tra 5 miliardi di anni circa. Riusciamo a formulare pensieri perchè siamo reti neurali che presentano proprietà emergenti, e tali proprietà ""provano loro stesse"" come ""pensiero"" o ""coscienza"". Abbiamo molti casi clinici in cui certe sezioni del cervello sono state danneggiate che hanno reso persone incapaci di riconoscere sè stesse o gli altri, o casi clinici di due coscienze nello stesso corpo. Se sei mai stato sotto anestesia sai che la percezione del tuo intorno e del tempo è fortemente condizionata da sostanze che cambiano gli equilibri chimici del tuo cervello, e con esso il comportamento della rete neurale che lo costituisce. Simili effetti avvengono con le sinestesie, o sotto l'effetto di droghe.


&gt; Questa e' un'uscita proprio da stronzo, passami il termine. Chi ti dice che io non abbia studiato? Chi cazzo ha parlato del passato soprattutto prima di questo intervento? Io ho parlato dell'utilita' sociale che possono avere i preti. Introltre, tra Vanna Marchi e la chiesa c'e' differenza. Almeno per quanto la chiesa ha fatto o comunque stimolato (arte, letteratura, comunita', solidarieta' etc. etc.. Lo stesso vale per scientology e altre religioni ""nuove""). Metterle esattamente sullo stesso piano vuol dire essere solamente in mala fede.

ma si basano tutte sullo sfruttamento dell'ignoranza. Che qualcuno poi ci abbia scritto dei libri e filosofeggiato, è un altro discorso (anche se, a dire la verità, c'è chi filosofeggia sulle linee sincroniche, che con vanna marchi ha qualche attinenza relativamente diretta). Il sangue di san gennaro è un altro esempio (peraltro non riconosciuto ufficialmente quale miracolo dal vaticano) di processo scientifico ben chiaro (tissotropia) che viene sfruttato per ragioni propagandistiche e, in ultimo luogo, monetarie e politiche (e i sindaci di napoli a baciare la teca lo testimoniano).

&gt; Io ho mai difeso la religione? Non mi pare proprio, non c'e' quindi bisogno di farmi lezioni su questo. Ho solamente detto che a livello sociale i preti fanno anche cose buone.

Ho capito ma non lo fanno perchè sono preti. Lo fanno perchè son brave persone, e non hanno altro da fare ne' famiglia da mantenere, quindi (qualcuno) si dedica 100% al volontariato. Non dico che sono inutili, dico che il loro ruolo in quei settori è ridondante in una società in cui tali servizi sono gestiti a livello statale.

&gt; La stesso discorso allora vale anche per le associazioni che tu hai portato come esempio. In uno stato perfetto non dovrebbero esistere in quanto servizi gia' forniti, non trovi?

E difatti è così. Noi italiani, avendo uno stato altamente inefficiente, tendiamo ad arrangiarci e organizzarci. Molte delle associazioni e servizi di volontariato che esistono in Italia non esistono all'estero, o perchè non servono (lo Stato lo offre, o rende il problema iniziale non esistente) o perchè non c'è la cultura di associazione (noi italiani siamo più sociali del resto d'Europa, specie al nord). Con questo non voglio dire che non esistono associazioni volontarie all'estero, ben chiaro.

&gt; Purtroppo il nostro stato e' quello che e' e di conseguenza abbiamo necessita' di ""aiutarci tra di noi"".

Sì ma lo facciamo male. Invece di un mare di associazioni di dilettanti, un po' di coalescenza migliorerebbe molto le cose, e darebbe uniformità, pianificazione e budget migliori.

This neighborhood has (or had) the [worst rate of HIV infection](http://www.dominionpaper.ca/articles/1996) in all of North America, with a rate of infection as bad or worse than parts of Africa. It's a pretty grim place, and stands in stark contrast to the rest of the city (even immediately surrounding the DTES) which is ""sparkling"", ""clean"" and ""new"".

If you hang out in an alley in the DTES for long enough you're likely to witness a reality of hard drug use with which you are probably not familiar. A few folks may park themselves next to a dumpster, shoot each other up in the neck (because those are the ""best"" veins, and the only ones they have left) and proceed to defecate/fornicate/overdose. Maybe all three at once.

The rate of mental illness is also high. Many of the residents have, in addition to their drug addiction, borderline personality disorder, schizophrenia, or post traumatic stress disorder.

So that's the reality from which my opinions are formed. Noone ""chooses"" to live in the DTES. It's not ""fun"", there's no ""heroin chic"", ""grunge"", ""partier"" bullshit. This is not ""recreational"" drug use. This is the real face of the drug war. This is where the real demand for meth, and coke, and crack comes from. Everything else is just yuppies trying to make their lives less forgettable.

It is neither a dialect of German nor Dutch, although it has taken on aspects of those languages over the last few centuries. 

Sadly the language will go extinct in a few more generations, because it, and the accent in the national language native speakers of Low Saxon usually have, has a social stigma attached to it that makes finding jobs in 'civilized society' harder.

The differences are: we have two additional sounds that don't exist in standard Hungarian (the ë and the lj), we use some ancient words that aren't used so much (bicikli vs kerékpár, which is just a direct translation from bicycle) and we also use a lot of Serb words without knowing they aren't Hungarian.

Like I said, when we traveled to the east of Hungary we were understood without problems, but when we go to Budapest we always get the retarded question ""you're not Hungarians aren't you?"" and once a girl at an information desk even told us ""sorry I don't speak English"" when we asked her in plain Hungarian where shop xxx is.

This distinction between suburban Flemish and general Dutch is odd. Most TV and radio hosts speak general Dutch and would sound out of place if they didn't. But general Dutch isn't really spoken outside of media and official positions, so most people can't really pull it off and it sounds unnatural in informal conversation. So a host of a laidback talkshow can find themselves in the weird position of speaking general Dutch in a supposedly informal conversation.

Also, there's a phenomenon that will help you immensely: La canción del verano (song of the summer). Every summer there's one song in particular that stuck to the collective pop culture like glue. These are, arguably, the most popular songs in Spain. They follow a common formula, as most of them have very catchy music and lyrics AND a simple to perform dance, which you will learn as people perform them.

Here's a handy [top 50 list](http://listas.20minutos.es/lista/los-50-mejores-canciones-de-verano-de-la-historia-17128/). Most of them are in Spanish.

The year or artist doesn't match in a few of them (for example, #11, ""Un rayo de sol"", is by Los Diablos, and #16, ""Chica Ye Ye"" is by Concha Velasco alright, but in the 60's rather than the 90's.

#19 (No rompas mi corazón) is a cover of Achy Breaky Heart, I recommend you play the Coyote Dax version rather than the original.

#20 (Que viva España) is as basic a song to play as Macarena or Paquito el Chocolatero.

#33 is bullshit. Don't play that crap.

Check out Georgie Dann. The motherfucker wrote a good 4 or 5 canciones del verano. La Barbacoa, El Chiringuito, El Bimbó, Carnaval Carnaval...

King Africa is another such artist. El Camaleón, La Bomba, the already mentioned Paquito el Chocolatero or El Humaguaqueño are sure to make 'em dance.

true,FrisianDude,FRIE,Friesland,"imo, the media concentrates too much on the failures in integration; I dare say by far most do integrate well enough, and though some cloister themselves off (quite possibly mainly due to negative attitudes towards their religion) and in cloistering become more fundamental, most children and descendants thereof of immigrants are less religious than their parents. 

-

However, the only way to allow better integration is by actually allowing those immigrants to integrate. If the society they move to attack everything they hold dear like idiots like Wilders do, what incentive is there for them to join a society that decided from the start that those immigrants are evildoers with 
&gt;a poisonous ideology that threatens my culture and way of life.

Even though all immigrants want is to live without the constant threat of exploding/being murdered by Talibastards. Hostility always breeds hostility. 

-

That said, there certainly IS a tendency to fundamentalism in the -often shitty- countries said immigrants left. Sometimes that is why those migrants left. I don't think that the religion itself is more fundamentalist than most Christian groups are. (Indeed the most important difference seems to be the number of prophets.)

true,bonzinip,ITAL,Italy,"In the Florence/Rome regions, the dialect is very close to Italian so it is really a dialect rather than a separate, non-mutually-intelligible language. Tuscan dialect sounds like Italian from the 1600. :) Romanesco has a lot of truncated words and some replaced sounds (l tends to become r, consonants after m or n are dropped and the m/n is lengthened, etc.), but it's still basically Italian.

Southern Italy dialects are still quite close to Italian, especially in the grammar. But ""strict"" dialect is still quite hard to understand. People often talk with a mixture of dialect and Italian that is easily understood, just a little worse than a very strong accent. It's also what you'll hear in TV when characters are from these regions.

Northern Italy dialects are quite far from Italian (more or less like French) and not necessarily intelligible between themselves. The grammar varies a lot. That's where I am from; the dialect is almost dead but my grandparents speak it and I can understand most of it. I can understand a little Piemontese and Venetian, but not Bolognese or eastern Lombard (Bergamo area). The dialects died out in the 60s/70s, when Southern Italy immigrants came to work in the north and factory unions heavily discouraged dialects to ease communications. Areas that had less immigration may still use dialect more. For example Venetians also do the same kind of switching that happens in the South.

Swearing in dialect is quite healthy though, throughout the whole of Italy. :)

Je serais déjà curieux de vous voir m'expliquer ce que vous entendez par ""libertés numériques"". 

Le sujet du numérique en France n'est pas une question de voix et de suffrages.  Le Parti Pirate est l'illustration de ce qu'il ne faut pas faire sur ce sujet. Comment venir parler de libertés avec l'utilisation du mot ""pirate"" ? C'est d'une idiotie sans borne. 

D'une part, c'est reprendre une expression vide de sens employée pour désigner la contrefaçon. C''est déjà partir bien bas pour traiter de questions bien larges. 

D'autre part, c'est juste un moyen pour attirer le chaland, le geek peu intéressé de la politique, et pour lui dire ""Hé toi, toi là, tu aimes thepiratebay ? Viens voter pour nous, on est trop cool, on aime les ordinateurs, Ubuntu, et regarde, là regarde, des masques d'Anonymous, on va défendre l'Internet !"". On est dans le militantisme bas du frond, mais qui s'entend et qui est cool. C'est fort triste, mais c'est ce que j'ai aperçu à chaque intervention du PP dans mon coin. Ça, et la publicité relativement déguisée pour les activités professionnelles des représentants du parti.  

Je n'ai jamais entendu le PP s'exprimer sur la taxation du numérique, question pourtant fondamentale en France, et d'une actualité criante. 

Plus globalement, traiter comme vous le proposez des questions du numérique uniquement par un parti politique, qui se cantonnerait à ces questions, ce n'est pas acceptable. Vous souhaitez vraiment des députés incompétents sur 95% des lois en préparation ? Ce n'est pas parce qu'un sujet vous intéresse qu'il doit être le seul à être traité.

That said, taxis are cheap (at least compared to London!) and so I'd always get one when going home. Otherwise, try and go home with friends. Unfortunately, you will probably get bothered at some point... I did have friends who avoided wearing skirts and so on. I don't feel that safe in London either, however, there are some parts of Paris in the centre (e.g. 6th, 7th...) which become very quiet at night and I found it a bit creepy walking through those areas on my own. Be aware of your surroundings, be careful and try and get a taxi. I never used the bus when I was there, as everyone complained about it.

Language skills: You'll start to pick it up quickly, so long as you try and engage with French people. My speaking skills were weak when I arrived and after making an effort to meet people, they improved a lot. 

Making friends: There are tons of French sites for meeting people! Along with actual social networks (onvasortir.com), you can also try forums like doctissimo, where there always seem to be a bunch of French people looking to make friends. For non-Frenchies, try meetup.com.

What did I like about Paris? I just loved living somewhere different. Beautiful buildings, the rooftops, getting to hear French everywhere, learning all the different things that distinguish French culture from your own... I love the way the city is arranged in a spiral and I loved seeing how there was something new in every arrondissement to explore. The ones in the centre get the most attention but there are some great areas outside there, like the village in the 13th.

Bad things? Rude customer service, bad bus service, bureaucracy. I was also shocked by how many homeless people there were on the street and how noticeable they were. You often get them on trains telling you their life story or you see them kneeling in the street with a big sign saying that they are hungry, which is really sad.

Sicilian has a social stigma attached to it, especially in larger cities, and in general it is prevalent among the less affluent people. Being associated with stereotype mobsters in Italy and abroad does not help either. In general, it is common that anyone will try to ""Italianize"" as much as possible when speaking to people they are not familiar with.

true,VomisaCaasi,ESTO,Estonia,"Fun fact. It's an urban myth that speakers of Võro, although separated by traditional Estonian speakers, can make out Finns quite easily, as opposed to those traditional Estonian speakers that live in between.

Anyhow, I grew up and still spend half of my time on an island called Hiiumaa (population of 11000), which sprouts a dialect of Hiiu (which is further divided into four sub-dialects), though my parents were ""Estonian immigrants"" to Hiiumaa, so Hiiu wasn't really my ""kitchen language"". Those dialects are somewhat simpler and lazier version of Estonian, and do sound a lot like a traditional Estonian when one has had a one too many drinks, and can still be heard in various degrees among locals who hasn't had much contact with the mainland, especially those over 50.

A tidbit from Estonian wiki: ""Kui saap mind tunne, siis ma ütle, et ma ole eht hiidlene ja ma kirjuta riigi keeles. Neh, sa tääd ju küll, et maa ilmes aa kolm mere riiki. Nee aa Hiiumaa, Saaremaa ja Inglismaa."" 

In Estonian, however, one would translate it to: ""Kui sa mind ei tunneks, siis ma ütleks sulle, et ma olen puhas hiidlane ja ma kirjutan riigikeeles. Noh, sa tead küll, et maailmas on kolm mereriiki. Need on Hiiumaa, Saaremaa ja Inglismaa.""

That roughly translates to ""If you didn't know me, I'd tell you that I was a pure inhabitant of Hiiumaa and I'd write in the official language. Well, you are of course aware that there are only three true sea countries in the world. These are Hiiumaa, Saaremaa and England.""

true,sqrt2,EURO,European Union,"""Hell no."" is misleading to say the least. Standard German, the Alemannic and Austro-Bavarian dialects have one important thing in common: they are High German dialects, i.e. dialects spoken south of the [Benrath line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benrath_line) which partook in the appropriately named High German consonant shift (/k/-&gt;/x/, /t/-&gt;/ts/ etc.). This why Standard German is fairly different from Dutch, English and the Scandinavian languages, all of which did not have said consonant shift. (Compare e.g. Standard German ""Zeit"", English ""time"", Dutch ""tijd"", Swedish ""tid"", Low German ""Tied"" and Viennese ""Zãt"".)

So, during Luther's time, the German language was fragmented into two big groups--High and Low German--, and a choice had to be made. Since Luther derived his language from the High German Saxon dialect, Standard German became a High German dialect, too.

I'd say I'm more Dutch than European. If I am of the latter it would be selective European (with cultures close to the Dutch one).

This is a little slab of land with a lot of different languages, cultures and histories. Granted: quite some cultures can be grouped, but there are a lot of prejudices in between people because of history, culture, etc.

It's one of the reasons I'm sceptical about the whole ""European Union"", the economic north/south divide that's seen in the ""crisis"" is merely one of them. Besides that I don't trust a political/economical union on social issues either: in some countries homosexuals are allowed to marry, in other countries they're barely allowed to live.

Something besides the incompabilities I perceive is that here in the Netherlands the government is so goddamn pro-european, we're basically being force-fed to be pro-european.
When the ""european constitution"" was rejected by a majority of the dutch people, we were force-fed the damn thing again with some minor tweaks (for the dutch van Rompuy is not the president, but the ""chairman"", bullshit like that).

And for god's cake don't put anything you don't want stolen on a café table (phones/wallets), someone will run past and steal it before you can blink.

Either way, it's better not to press your luck: just skip the song and avoid a possible conflict.

true,bonzinip,ITAL,Italy,"In the Florence/Rome regions, the dialect is very close to Italian so it is really a dialect rather than a separate, non-mutually-intelligible language. Tuscan dialect sounds like Italian from the 1600. :)  Romanesco has a lot of truncated words and some replaced sounds (l tends to become r, consonants after m or n are dropped and the m/n is lengthened, etc.), but it's still basically Italian.

Southern Italy dialects are still quite close to Italian, especially in the grammar. But ""strict"" dialect is still quite hard to understand. As the parent comment said, people often talk with a mixture of dialect and Italian that is easily understood, just a little worse than a very strong accent. It's also what you'll hear in TV when characters are from these region.

Northern Italy dialects are quite far from Italian (more or less like French) and not necessarily intelligible between themselves. The grammar varies a lot. That's where I am from; the dialect is almost dead but my grandparents speak it and I can understand most of it.  I can understand a little Piemontese and Venetian, but not Bolognese or eastern Lombard (Bergamo area). The dialects died out in the 60s/70s, when Southern Italy immigrants came to work in the north and factory unions heavily discouraged dialects to ease communications. Areas that had less immigration may still use dialect more. For example Venetians also do the same kind of switching that happens in the South.

&gt;Chers messieurs et dames

&gt;Nous sommes extrêmement inquiets face aux nouvelles qui émergent par rapport à la dénommé “Mauvaise Banque”. En principe cet instrument financier viserait à libérer le système financier espagnol de leurs actifs toxiques immobiliers et il obtiendrait les ressources nécessaires des impôts des citoyens. Cela ne serait un sacrifice acceptable que si ladite banque serait vouée à ce précis propos.

&gt;Malheureusement il se fait de plus en plus évident que l'élite gouvernante espagnole a ses propres idées au sujet de cette “Banque Mauvaise”. Idées qui sont contraires aux intérêts des citoyens espagnols et européens. L'analyse de l'information publiée sur la création de ce mécanisme financier, indique que l'élite gouvernante espagnole n'a aucun intérêt a permettre l'alignement des prix des actifs toxiques immobiliers qui lestent les bilans de la banque espagnole.

&gt;Bien au contraire, cette élite semble planifier l'emploi de la “Banque Mauvaise” pour soutenir l'actuel niveau de prix des actifs toxiques. Les conséquences de cette aberration , si elle venait à se produire, sont d'une telle magnitude que nous croyons notre devoir vous faire part de nos inquiétudes.

&gt;D'abord, cela empêcherait l'indispensable alignement de prix dans le marché immobilier espagnol, ce qui irait contre l'objectif promu de restaurer la compétitivité de l'économie espagnole. En effet, l'excessif prix de l'immobilier nie la mobilité aux travailleurs et en plus réduit à un niveau prochain à zéro leurs revenus disponibles. Ce qui est plus, dans une économie avec des manques structurelles dans les secteurs de plus haute valeur ajoutée, enterrer dans la brique tous ces fonds rélève de la folie pure et simple.

&gt;Il n'y a que les espagnols à s'inquiéter,parce que tous les contribuables européens seraient appelés à fournir un croissant pourcentage de leurs épargnes pour réduire les pertes d'un système financier régional si malheuresement geré. Les banques choisies vendraient leurs actifs- aussi ""choisis""- à des prix très supérieures à ceux du marché, après de taxations fondées en concepts abstraits comme la “valeur à long terme”, qui ne seraient qu'un vol effronté aux citoyens espagnols et européens.

&gt;Dans l'actuelle situation du marché immobilier,  la soi disante “Mauvaise Banque” deviendrait un mécanisme pour empêcher l'alignement des prix immobiliers en Espagne. Il n'aurait aucun espoir de faire des massives ventes d'actifs immobiliers à des investisseurs privés, avec un niveau de prix si éloigné du marché. Donc, le mécanisme deviendrait équivalent a transférer l'argent de tous les contribuables européens à quelques agents privilegiés minoritaires proches du pouvoir politique et social espagnol.

&gt;Pour l'Espagne, cette situation laisserait une citoyenneté encore plus appauvrie, un gouvernement plus endetté et des mauvaises perspectives pour un secteur industriel qui aurait trouvé un meilleur soutien dans la drastique baisse des prix immobiliers.

&gt;Pour l'Europe, cette situation implique le gaspillage de centaines de milliards d'euros des contribuables, qui seront remis au système financier espagnol sans aucune contrepartie. De plus, ça lesterait le redressement de l'économie espagnole, ce qui ajouterait des doutes et des spéculations sur la viabilité a long terme de l' Europe.

&gt;Nous, un humble collectif de citoyens qui désire voir la commune patrie européenne reprendre le chemin de la prospérité, prions votre aide pour reconduire ce plan, qui, dans son actuelle configuration, atteint directement contre l'intérêt de l'Espagne et de ses amis et allies européens.

&gt;Nous vous prions d'agréer, chers lecteurs et gentilles lectrices, l'expression de nos salutations distinguées.

&gt;    Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren, 

&gt;    Während der letzten Tage haben wir mit steigender Besorgnis ein beunruhigendes Ereignis beobachtet, welches, würde es sich komplett vollziehen,  dem Erholungsprozess der europäischen Wirtschaft große Probleme bereiten könnte.

&gt;    Wir sind extrem besorgt wegen der Nachrichten, die in Bezug auf „die böse Bank“ entstehen, die als ein „Reiniger“ der Bilanzen der spanischen Bank fungieren sollte, um diese von ihren toxischen Immobilienvermögenswerten zu befreien, um ihnen zu erlauben mit ihren alltäglichen Transaktionen fortzufahren. Dieser Mechanismus wird die notwendigen Ressourcen vom Geld der Steuerzahler bekommen, ein notwendiges Übel, das akzeptabel wird, wenn wir die potenziellen Vorteile bedenken, die der spanischen Wirtschaft und  folglich der Glaubwürdigkeit der Eurozone und der europäischen Union zu Teil werden könnten.

&gt;    Bedauerlicherweise ist im Laufe der Zeit immer eindeutiger zu bemerken, dass  die spanische Regierung ihre eigenen Ideen bezüglich der „bösen Bank“ hat, Ideen, die von dem abweichen, was vermeintlich von Interesse für die Bürger  Spaniens und der europäische Union ist. Analysiert man die Information, die über die Kreation dieses finanziellen Mechanismus veröffentlicht wird, ist es offensichtlich, dass die spanische Regierung kein Interesse hat, eine Preiskorrektur der toxischen Immobilienvermögenswerte zu gestatten, die die Bilanzen der spanischen Bank beinhalten.

&gt;    Ganz im Gegenteil scheint die Regierung in Betracht zu ziehen, diese von dem Mechanismus gegebenen „finanziellen Muskeln“ zu benutzen, um das heutige Preisniveau der toxischen Immobilienvermögenswerte zu halten. Die Folgen und Verzweigungen dieser Perversion des ursprünglichen Zieles, falls es erreicht würde, sind sicherlich stark genug, so dass alle Bürger Europas im Bilde sein werden.

&gt;    Zuerst würde dieses Szenario bedeuten zu vermeiden, dass die notwendige Preiskorrektur im spanischen Immobilienmarkt in all seiner Ausdehnung stattfindet. Dies verstößt direkt gegen das mehrmals wiederholte Ziel, die Wettbewerbsfähigkeit  der spanischen Wirtschaft wiederherzustellen, da die hohen Immobilienkosten die Arbeitsmobilität behindern und die verfügbare Rente vieler spanischer Arbeiter gegen Null reduzieren.

&gt;    Nicht nur die Spanier, die gegen diese absurden Preisen kämpfen, sind die, die besorgt sein müssen, da alle Steuerzahler umso mehr ihres schon geringen Ersparten zahlen sollen, um die Verluste des Banksystems zu reduzieren. Die Banken würden ihre toxischen Vermögenswerte zu Summen über dem Marktwert verkaufen, wobei diese anhand abstrakter Konzepte von „langfristigem Wert“ bewertet werden, was nichts weiter als ein beschämender Diebstahl an der Bürgerschaft bedeutet.

&gt;    Dies würde die „böse Bank“ in nichts weiter als einen Gefrierschrank für Ziegelsteine verwandeln, angesichts der aktuellen Markbedingungen. Man könnte keine großen Hoffnungen haben auf massives Verkaufen von Immobilienvermögenswerten an private Investoren zu Preisen so weit über dem Marktwert, was bedeutet, dass die Steuerzahler keine Hoffnungen haben sollten, dass dieses Geld wieder in Hände der Regierung geraten wird. Auf diese Weise wäre der Mechanismus vergleichbar mit der Praxis, Geld im Garten zu vergraben.

&gt;    In Spanien wird dieses Szenario eine noch verarmtere Bevölkerung hinterlassen, finstere Perspektiven für einen Industriezweig, der große Unterstützung in einer Immobilienkosten-Senkung und ein noch mehr verschuldeten Staat gefunden hätte.

&gt;    Für Europa wird dieses Szenario die Ausgabe von Tausend Millionen Euro von den Steuerzahlern bedeuten, Geld, das im spanischen Banksystem unentgeltlich einfließen würde. Darüber hinaus würde dies den Erholungsprozess der spanischen Wirtschaft erschweren, was Zweifel und Spekulationen über die Zukunft der Eurozone als lebensfähige Entität schüren würde.

&gt;    Wir als bescheidene Gruppe von Bürgern, die die Hoffnung habe zu sehen, dass Spanien und Europa den Weg zum Wohlstand wiederaufnehmen, hoffen, dass Sie uns mit der Verbreitung dieses Plans helfen werden, der direkt gegen die Interessen Spaniens und seiner Freunde sowie seiner europäischen Verbündeten verstößt.

&gt;Muy señor mío,

&gt;Nos hallamos extremadamente preocupados ante las noticias que surgen en relación al llamado “Banco Malo”, que debiera  liberar a la banca española de sus activos tóxicos inmobiliarios para permitirles continuar con sus operaciones diarias. Este mecanismo obtendrá los recursos necesarios del dinero de los contribuyentes, un mal necesario sólo aceptable cuando consideramos sus beneficios potenciales para la economía española y consecuentemente, para la credibilidad de la Eurozona y la Unión Europea.

&gt;Desafortunadamente, se aprecia de forma cada vez más evidente que el gobierno español tiene sus propias ideas respecto a este “Banco Malo”, ideas que se desvían de lo que debe considerarse de interés para los ciudadanos de España y Europa. Analizando la información que se publica sobre la creación de este mecanismo financiero, queda claro que el gobierno español no tiene ningún interés en permitir una corrección en el precio de los activos tóxicos inmobiliarios que albergan los balances de la banca española.

&gt;Muy al contrario, el gobierno parece estar contemplando el usar el músculo financiero ofrecido por el mecanismo para mantener el nivel de precios actual de los activos tóxicos. Las consecuencias de esta perversión del objetivo original son ciertamente de la suficiente magnitud como para justificar nuestra legítima preocupación y la de todos los ciudadanos europeos.

&gt;En primer lugar, este escenario supondría impedir la necesaria corrección de precios en el mercado inmobiliario español. Esto atenta directamente contra el objetivo repetidamente anunciado de restaurar la competitividad de la economía española, ya que los altos costes inmobiliarios impiden la movilidad laboral y reducen la renta disponible de muchos trabajadores españoles a niveles cercanos a cero.

&gt;No son sólo los contribuyentes españoles quienes deberían sentirse preocupados por sus ahorros, sino todos los ciudadanos europeos, dado que los bancos se desprenderían de sus activos tóxicos a un “valor a largo plazo” muy superior a su precio actual. En las condiciones de mercado actuales esto convertiría al “Banco Malo” en un congelador de ladrillos, puesto que con unos precios tan alejados del mercado no cabría albergar esperanzas de grandes ventas masivas de activos inmobiliarios a inversores privados. Por tanto, el esfuerzo de los contribuyentes españoles y europeos sería en vano.

&gt;Para España, este escenario dejaría una población aún más empobrecida, unas perspectivas sombrías para un sector industrial que habría encontrado un gran apoyo en un abaratamiento de los costes inmobiliarios, y un gobierno aún más endeudado.

&gt;Para Europa, este escenario supone el gasto de cientos de miles de millones de euros de los contribuyentes, dinero que iría al sistema bancario español sin contrapartida significativa alguna. Además, lastraría la recuperación de la economía española, lo que añadiría dudas y especulaciones sobre el futuro de la Eurozona como entidad viable.

&gt;Nosotros, como humilde colectivo de ciudadanos que aspiramos ver a España y Europa retomando el camino a la prosperidad, sinceramente esperamos su ayuda en la reconducción de este plan, que en su presente configuración atenta directamente contra los intereses de España y sus amigos y aliados europeos.

Since you're carrying a drawstring bag, I'd make sure that it is in your view as much as possible, especially on the metro and when sitting at cafes. I'd even put it on your lap, if you're sitting down, rather than on the seat next to you. If you constantly keep it on your back, someone might try and slip their hand in  and when you're all squashed together on the metro, you may not notice. We've got a lot of scams in London where you're at the ATM and people tell you that you've dropped something. They'll sometimes even put a note on the floor. I expect they probably do this in Paris - just ignore them. 

As the poster above mentioned, you'll get people going around with clipboards with some questionnaire. Decline or ignore them. I remember seeing a lot of teenagers with them at the Gare du Nord, near all the tourists waiting to buy a ticket.

When I was in Paris, I got a lot of people not only asking me for money, but also for coffee and once for dinner(!). Try not to be too startled and keep a distance from them.

**Sights to see.**
Did a quick skim of the FAQ and don't think this is on there - if you want a good view of Paris and want to avoid the massive queues at the Eiffel Tower or all the people at Montmartre, go to **la Tour Montparnasse**. It's right outside the station, tall and black, you can't miss it. It's not a pretty sight, but queues there will be pretty short or non-existent and the view at the top is just as good.

**Chez Georges**, 11 rue des Cannettes, in the 6th is awesome. Great atmosphere. Always tons of people outside.

**L'Experimental Cocktail Club** 37 rue Saint Sauveur, 2nd, is meant to be good. I really like the London one. Make sure you dress up a bit.

**Pierre Hermé** for macaroons. There are several shops in the city. 6th, rue Bonaparte is the one I always went to!

**Areas to avoid**
**Big metro stations at night** if you can help it:
Châtelet-Les Halles (the area around there is a little dodgy as well)
LonelyPlanet also suggests avoiding: Château Rouge in Montmartre, Gare du Nord, Strasbourg St-Denis, Réaumur Sébastopol, and Montparnasse Bienvenüe.

Maybe I wouldn't express it as ""we are too different"", but at the moment I am not pro a federal Europe. Maybe that will change in the future, nothing is set in stone of course, but at the very least, I'd like to vote about it and be given a chance to voice my opinion, something that is denied almost all people in the EU at the moment.

What do you mean? It's a free market, by standardising the rules and laws, you get more competitive, not less. Had everyone followed the same strict financial regulations, for example, we'd be much more competitive now and not facing these issues.
