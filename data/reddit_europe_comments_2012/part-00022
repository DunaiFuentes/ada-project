true,yablebab,CZEC,Czech Republic,"Nuclear energy is actually one of safest forms of energy available, if you look at number of deaths per amount of energy produced. Coal, natural gas and petroleum are all much dirtier and deadly than nuclear.

Nuclear energy's image suffers from confirmation bias in the same way that airlines do. Flying a certain distance in an airplane and driving that distance on the highway are about equally risky ways to travel. But many more people are afraid of flying than driving. That has to do with the fact that while plane crashes are much rarer than car accidents, they are much more widely publicized.

Similarly, nuclear energy is much safer than just about any other ""dirty"" energy, but when a very rare accident does occur, it's a much bigger deal and gets more publicity.

If Germany plans to ban nuclear energy, they should replace it with solar, wind, and other clean energy sources. But it seems like until the infrastructure is built for that, they'll be giving up nuclear in favor of even more deadly forms of energy.

There are only two cases where that could happen:

1. A Staatsanwalt has nothing better to do and assumes intention when you bought the product (or made use of a service) and didn't pay afterwards. This could theoretically be considered as fraud. The truth is this happens rarely, because it's extremely hard to proof. It's also not the case with orangejellybean.

2. The whole legal proceeding (Gerichtliches Mahnverfahren) is done, the creditor have their title, but they are still unable to get money from you. So they send the Gerichtsvollzieher after you, but he's also unable to reach you or get money from you. Then they could request an ""Eidesstattliche Erklärung"". The Gerichtsvollzieher can put you in custody if you refuse to sign it, until you sign it. But you're not going into custody for the debt, you're going in because you refused to sign the Eidesstattliche Erklärung. And they can only hold you until you signed it, afterwards you're free.

Now, this is only true if the creditor is a private entity. If it's the state, it's a different thing. But that doesn't apply here.

The best thing to do is really pay it and get written acknowledgement from them that you don't owe them anything anymore. If you don't do that, they could get an enforceable title while you are away. This would be easy for them, because you've already acknowledged the validity of their claim by paying the original amount. This title is valid for 30 years.

I'm hoping that will change drastically within the next 5-10 years, as European energy grids become more integrated, and renewable energy tech becomes more efficient.  

The problem with your argument (which is correct - nuclear _is_ very expensive) is that it disregards the comparative huge costs of conventional fossil fuel-based energy, the only type of power generation that can, on the whole, compete with nukes.  Don't get me wrong, individual countries can supply many of their needs with non-nuke, non-fossil power - Switzerland, for example.  But that's because of geographic or other circumstances, in the Swiss' case loads of alpine lakes that are great for damming, which may not apply elsewhere.

The difference between the nuke and fossil fuel costs is that the latter are often hidden and long-term, e.g. pollution.

What I'm really interested in learning about is the long-term cost of nuclear fuel - Uranium isn't an endlessly available resource.

Nuclear waste storage is safe.  It's not pretty, it takes effort and space, but it's safe.  Like any aspect of large-scale power generation, it has to be done right.  

People don't want it in their backyards because they're frightened of pictures like [this](http://www.snakeriveralliance.org/Portals/2/images/1969dumping.JPG) - a very real issue in parts of the world.  It needn't be the case.

Filter systems do not make coal-fired plants ""clean"".  Even if you could remove the vast majority of sulphur and other contaminants, you still end up with huge amounts of CO2 and toxic sludge.  Gas is not economically an option - Russia &amp; friends are not currently capable of reliably delivering the amounts that Europe needs as it stands, or not willing to, which comes out to the same thing.

Nuclear plants have their downsides.  They require a lot of regulatory oversight, have a huge startup cost, need constant supervision and responsible management, demand a gigantic logistical rat's tail of secondary and tertiary work (like waste storage and fuel supply), but they're a hell of a lot cleaner than the nearest economically feasible alternatives.

How can you say something is safe that is dangerous for such a long time? Nobody has any knowledge about that. I'm not saying it might not be possible, but the population doesn't seem happy with the current solutions and that's not just the people in those regions.

&gt; CO2

I understand that CO2 is an issue, but I also think that Germans at the moment also look at other countries which are doing much much worse when it comes to CO2 and as long as those countries don't take serious measures it is a futile mission here. Also the goal is to use this for a transition phase to green energy, the question is just how long it will take, but the problem is also that as long as you keep going with nuclear this phase will take forever.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Not accusing you, just disappointed that so many discussions about environmental topics tend to attract ""I-disagree-so-fuck-you"" without people actually contributing.  Thank you for the reply.

&gt; How can you say something is safe that is dangerous for such a long time? Nobody has any knowledge about that. I'm not saying it might not be possible, but the population doesn't seem happy with the current solutions and that's not just the people in those regions.

My problem is that almost all the ""debate"" points made against nuclear waste storage are emotional.  I'd really love for a nuclear engineer to contribute here, but as I understand it, waste is fused in a glass-like substance inside a multilayered container that would require forces so enormous to cause it to ""leak"" that, if you did have an accident, you'd have other much more serious problems at the same time.

And yes, I'm highly optimistic about the probability that this is as transitory a phase as you believe fossil fuel to be - the argument that fossil power is a temporary solution is one I find flawed, because, if you compare the two:

- nuclear power: Possible long-term impact, high likelihood of technological solution within next 30 years
- fossil power:  Definite short-term and long-term impact, high likelihood of technological solution within next 30 years

For me, the comparison is pretty clear.  

The potential of nuclear energy is enormous - I've already mentioned thorium reactors.  Breeder reactors were largely abandoned because Uranium was too cheap.  That needn't be.

Again, I'd like to hear from an expert in the field here.  My main objection to many of the arguments made against nuclear power is that they're based on a mixture of hypothetical scenarios, outdated or incorrect information, and irrational fear-mongering.   

As I said, there _are_ perfectly valid and factual reasons why nuclear power is not a great solution.  It's a lot less worse than the alternative though.

&gt; as long as those countries don't take serious measures it is a futile mission here.

See, I disagree with this.  First, this has the danger of finger-pointing.  If the West doesn't take leadership, why should the Chinese be OK with reining in their emissions?  Look at how much damage the American and Canadian hesitation on things like Kyoto, however flawed, has done.

true,Vik1ng,null,null,"&gt; Anyone can enroll a gymnasium(at least in my state). 

Not in Bavaria you need certain grades in the 4th (or later) grade to get into a Gymnasium or I guess as you said there is a test. 

Also Gesamtschulen don't really exist in Bavaria, although there is actually [one in Munich](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willy-Brandt-Gesamtschule_M%C3%BCnchen) maybe this could be an option.

The problem I see here is that his son doesn't speak German, something they maybe should have looked into before they moved. And without those German language skills he has basically zero chance to pass a year in the Gymnasium, especially when he in the 6 grade would have to translate Germany-Latin as a 2nd language or something like that. The grades are from 1(best)-6(worst) and if you have a 5 in two subjects or a 6 in one you fail the class (there are some exceptions) and if you fail twice in a certain class range you have to leave the school. But with zero knowledge in German I don't see how you could get through this, especially when you consider that just 50% of the students who go to the Gymnasium actually get a degree in Bavaria. That's why a make-up is pretty useless, because he would just fail in class not to mention that in Germany it doesn't really work for many test and I'm pretty sure a German language test would be included there and that is just impossible for him.

I think the best he could do is to speak with the local administration, maybe there is some public school that is based on English.

Overall the German school system offers you a lot of options later on to get into higher education, but this also requires the according grades, but it would for example be possible to get to the Gymnasium although you started the Hauptschule, but it takes a lot of work and that's not the only option how to progress through the system.

In the end my personal advice would be not to go with Hauptschule if he doesn't find a different options (which I hope he does) and go with a private school. The problem with Hauptschule is just that he can get very unlucky with the social environment, although  I guess he is a lot better with that in Bavaria compared to Berlin.

""The epidemiological study on childhood cancer in the vicinity of nuclear power plants (KiKK) resulted in the finding that in Germany children under 5 years of age contract cancer, in particular leukaemia, more frequently the nearer they live to a nuclear power plant. Earlier ecological studies already showed an increased risk of children under 5 years of age living within the 5-km-zone around a nuclear power plant site contracting cancer. Since it was designed in a more elaborate way (case-control study) than earlier studies, the KiKK study provides a more reliable database. On the basis of the more exact methodology it could be shown that the childhood cancer incidence rate depends on the distance of the home to a nuclear power plant site and that the increased risk prevails in the entire study region, i. e. also outside the 5-km-zone.

[Health effects on population near nuclear power plants and workers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_debate#Health_effects_on_population_near_nuclear_power_plants_and_workers)
&gt;A major concern in the nuclear debate is what the long-term effects of living near or working in a nuclear power station are. These concerns typically center around the potential for increased risks of cancer. However, studies conducted by non-profit, neutral agencies have found no compelling evidence of correlation between nuclear power and risk of cancer.[120]


About your study:
&gt;A German study on childhood cancer in the vicinity of nuclear power plants, the KiKK study[128] was published in December 2007. According to Ian Fairlie, it ""resulted in a public outcry and media debate in Germany which has received little attention elsewhere"". It has been established ""partly as a result of an earlier study by Körblein and Hoffmann[129] which had found statistically significant increases in solid cancers (54%), and in leukemia (76%) in children aged less than 5 within 5 km of 15 German nuclear power plant sites. It reported a 2.2-fold increase in leukemias and a 1.6-fold increase in solid (mainly embryonal) cancers among children living within 5 km of all German nuclear power stations.""[130] In 2011 a new study of the KiKK data was incorporated into an assessment by the Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment (COMARE) of the incidence of childhood leukemia around British nuclear power plants. **It found that the control sample of population used for comparison in the German study may have been incorrectly selected and other possible contributory factors, such as socio-economic ranking, were not taken into consideration. The committee concluded that there is no significant evidence of an association between risk of childhood leukemia (in under 5 year olds) and living in proximity to a nuclear power plant.[131]**

There's boom in Germany now, and due to the high costs of energy in Germany, especially of renewable energies, the Germans try to reduce their energy consumption. I think the changes are good, that the Germans will find a way to abandon nuclear energies by 2022 without replacing the capacities with fossil energies.

""For the period 1906 to 1988 there were 29 documented water breaches.""

""Water will always flow into a salt mine where the salt barrier in the surrounding structure is breached. This happens when the salt barrier is damaged in the drilling operation or by plasticity deformation of the salt resulting in cracks. Asse II is particularly threatened by water because the salt barrier is in some places only a few meters thick.""

""Because of the high number of tunnel constructions and the decades of use, the deformation in Asse II has reached the state that the pressurised salt is losing its stability: ""The supporting construction is softening by creep deformation, plasticity effects and local fractures from the ground pressure.""[4] The Institut für Gebirgsmechanik (IfG) in Leipzig which has been monitoring Asse II since 1996 predicted in 2007 that, from the beginning of 2014, an increase in the loss of the load carrying capacity will result in an increased displacement of the capping mass.[5] The shifts may lead to an uncontrollable increase in water inflow and make the continued operation as a dry pit impossible.
 
In 1979 a report on the stability of the pit building was released by a working group under the leadership of HH Juergens[6] which describes the now imminent scenario of uncontrolled inflow from the capping mass in the southern flank resulting in the subsequent loss of the load carrying capacity.""

""After media reports in 2008[1][2] about brine contaminated with radioactive caesium-137, plutonium and strontium, politicians accused the operator of not having informed the inspecting authorities. On September 8, 2008, the responsible ministers of Lower Saxony and the German government concluded to change the operator.""

With regards to risk:  I disagree.  

Nuclear reactors are heavily, heavily, heavily hardened.  Even if you could hit the reactor core with an aircraft, accidentally or intentionally, there are numerous design standards in place (in part implemented after 9/11) to prevent this from having any impact (ha ha).

The same goes for any form of terrorist attack I can think of, either via sabotage or a bomb - the former is addressed by a huge number of redundant layers of safeguards (you can't just push a button and it blows up - the same goes for operator error, by the way), while the latter would require a logistical nightmare of planning and an amount of explosives that's simply impractical.  

And as we all know very well, I hope, if you really want to spread terror, you don't go for the best-protected, high-profile targets.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"I'm not talking about leaks, those are extremes. What I'm referring to are how they have handled many minor accidents and malfunctions so far, some of which could have potentially lead to severe incidents. Just to be clear, it's not that those happen, that's what redundant security mechanisms and procedures are for. It's how operators, and not just one or two individual ones, handle them when they occur.

Here's one example, Brunsbüttel, 2001. After regulators analyse data and notice something is wrong, they inquire what had happened. The operator claims it was ""spontaneous leakage"", no biggie, and keeps operating the reactor at full load. Regulators say their data is not consistent with spontaneous leakage, and want to get boots on the ground. Only after they threaten a formal inquiry does the operator let them have their inspection. They find a hydrogen explosion took out two meters of a pipe, directly at the pressure chamber (part of the secondary cooling system). Here's [a picture](http://www.greenpeace.de/themen/atomkraft/nachrichten/artikel/wer_glaubt_noch_an_die_sicherheit_von_deutschen_akw/ansicht/bild/), if you forgive the Greenpeace link.

That was just an anomaly (INES 1), but the point is how the operator had handled it. Their instinct is to try to cover it up and protect their investment.

&gt; Again, I'm not saying ""nuclear is awesome, it's the best, let's go nukular 5ever &lt;3"". I'm saying that it's by far the best available option, especially compared to fossil power, until we're at the point when we can supply our needs using clean energy. A progressing, prosperous, industrial society needs a lot of power. We've got to get it from somewhere. This is, for now, the best way to do it.

Well, I'm not all ""nuclear accidents will kill us all"", either, and most definitely consider Climate Change to be the larger threat. But I believe that we *can* make renewables work if me make a serious effort (whether the current German government will manage this is a different question). I wouldn't have had a problem with running some of the more modern existing reactors for a couple years longer, but we need to actively invest into renewables if we want to get there, to grow a network of producers and suppliers, and we need to get serious about building the necessary network infrastructure to enable them to grow without bumping into limitations of the grid.",0,1330343987,null,0,false,0,c3vgovy,t3_q7tb1,t1_c3vgovy,t1_c3vgjm1,null,1435737573,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

I absolutely 100% agree.  I make no claims whatsoever that nuclear, at least in its present form, should be any more than a stopgap to cover near- to mid-term energy needs.  Renewables progress is critical to the future of power generation, not just in the actual technology itself, but in the willingness to do it.

An example:  my dad in Switzerland invested a lot of money into solar panels.  He caught the tail-end of big subsidies for panels.  It's great; even without feeding into the grid, he reckons that he'll amortize the cost within 10 years.  

Now here's the killer:  there was a limited project to let people feed power back into the grid and profit from it.  He has this nifty little smart box that shows him how much he's feeding back in.  In Switzerland, most power companies let you choose the ""mix"" of your power, paying more for ""green"" electricity.  It's pretty cool.  The more people have solar on their roofs, depending on time of day, the cheaper it's gonna get.  

The government wanted to subsidize the retrofitting of grids to handle this decentralized generation and billing mechanisms.  But guess what?  The fucking utility companies dragged their feet and opposed it at every turn because they knew it was going to cut into their profit margins from hydroelectric and nuclear juice.  That bit of politics set the progress of decentralized solar power back by who-knows-how-many-years.  It makes me fume just thinking about it.

As for your last question. For two reasons. 

1. The world's current challenge isn't how to deal with nuclear *anything*. It's climate change. Nuclear power can produce huge amounts of power without any noteworthy emission, if done correctly. Seeing as the bulk of the consequences of global warming will hit developing nations and not those responsible for them -- once again -- I cannot with good conscience go down any path that will increase emissions. For the time being, that means coal and other fossil plants should have to be shut down before we abandon nuclear power. 

2. The cost. Not only are renewable plants themselves incredibly expensive, they also require huge investments in related infrastructure.

As much as I'd like to see a switch to renewables, it's simply not possible right now.  There are reactors that need turning off, if not now then soon, because of safety concerns resulting from that learning process, and that's going to leave us with a big-ass gap in available power that can either be solved with starting construction of new, much safer, smaller nuke plants right now, thus ensuring that no matter _what_ happens, the country and the continent will have energy security for the foreseeable future, with fossil fuel plants (which may be cheaper but will also take a lot of time to build, and have way too many downsides to contemplate), or simply shutting off the lights - literally and figuratively.

As California's example showed, even if you take drastic power saving measures, the last simply does not work and has tragic economic effects.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"Well, it's not as if somebody would flip a switch in ten years and then we'll see whether it'll work or if everything goes dark. This is a gradual process, where renewable capacity constantly increases and once in a while a nuclear plant gets shuts down. Those developments can be monitored and weighted against each other, I'm sure the operators will be happy to operate their plants for a few more years if we ask them politely.

&gt; As much as I'd like to see a switch to renewables, it's simply not possible right now.

The thing is, a number of independent studies suggests that it is, even if Germany would go it alone. If more countries join in, and e.g., Denmark has the plans and is well on the way, then PV and wind turbines are spread over a wider area and therefore become less vulnerable to weather variations.

This requires investments into a better grid, though, not just incentives to build production capacity. A wind farm makes no sense if the grid can't take it, and that's where our government appears to be dropping the ball (although I do recognize that they have more urgent issues to deal with, at the moment).

To stress my other point again, there's more to developing a renewable capacity than only the technological side. Building the necessary industrial production capacity takes time, especially if it's supposed to be cost effective. The global capacity to produce PV panels is increasing in an almost explosive manner, but in terms of global energy requirement it's still tiny. You don't just need factories for the cells and panels, but for the silicon and experienced local contractors to install them. This takes time, waiting for €0.10/W PV panels before we get started on this would delay it by easily another decade, not to mention the need for an industry to do the necessary research in the first place.",0,1330349018,null,0,false,0,c3vh1ww,t3_q7tb1,t1_c3vh1ww,t1_c3vgxwd,null,1428428501,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

In Germany, there are also ""International Schools"" - where the spoken language is english or so.
I don't know much about them, and they have a bit of the ""exotic"" touch here, but I think they are just meant for that (= your actual problem).
http://www.mis-munich.de/
MIS = munich international school.

Also, don't concentrate on getting your kid to Gymnasium. I'm no fan of the Gymnasium, especially in Bavaria.
I've been there from 5th to 7th, afterwards I went to the Realschule (8th to 10th), then I took the alternative way to Abitur here (yes, there is one, there are even more) and went to the Fachoberschule (you also need certain grades here from the 10th Realschule, but it's quite low, minimum is 3,33 as mean value of the 4 main subjects' grades; in German, English, Math, and depending on your department, Physics/French/Art/Economics)

Pupils coming from Gymnasium have very often a lack of their ""independence"", don't know really how to explain in english.
The problem is, you don't have to take responsibility while the 7-8 years on Gymnasium. You can not really fail, because you get to the higher class even with grades like 4-4-4-4-5 (max. one 5 is allowed), which is really very bad. In Realschule/Hauptschule you have to write the final exam in the 9th or 10th, and if you fail, you have to repeat the class. Pupils from Gymnasium have their final exam in the 12th or 13th.
It's a controverse topic, and people who were on Gymnasium often get offended by this, but I've been to both types of school and know what I'm talking about.

(Sorry for getting away from topic; just some thoughts I had to share).

As for the Prime Minister, he's someone who's worked in banking pretty much the entirety of his life, he's not exactly a career politician is he now?

That said, it is a bit aggressive and tough on the eye. My humble opinion would be to get rid of the background image of the crests altogether as it really takes away from readability. Also, I'd choose a subtler gradient for the table headers and the submit a link button, maybe even try black with white text to echo the navigation bar.

Also I would consider moving the user bar up to the top right of the page like at /r/barca and maybe moving up the search field as well. Right now there are too many elements all in that same spot. You might even consider making the entire header much smaller as there is no reason for it to take up so much space if you're not going to post different banners. I'd make it about half the current size.

So I moved to the similar offer at B&amp;You. Planning to be back to Free when they improve a bit and activate FemtoCells in Freeboxes.

Improvements? I never received 4 SMS and that was annoying. Visual voicemail not there, and very basic voicemail (no option to call back... Grab a pen to write down a number!). Apart of that the price is great. It's even fantastic if you own a Freebox.

That said, if you want a vaguely stereotypical Parisian experience (assuming you are American here, apologies if not), you can find hostels (Aussie/American/Canadian one near my flat called Peace &amp; Love right on canal St Martin for example) for not a back breaking amount of money. That said, this is a damn expensive city so you will need to either skimp on food or lodging. Unlike London, most museums will cost you money too unless you are under 26, in which case you will get a decent discount. EDIT: you might need to be a European student to get the best museum discounts. I went to school here so I got coddled by the state :)

Yes, it's much more complex.
People think they know what's up and they blame us. I understand their reaction.
Actually, the truth they are feeding you is completely distorted.
And this is exactly the problem.
Because I can give you an alternative explanation of the situation: the ""complex"" one.
According to my side of the story (which you most certainly won't accept, so I won't even bother), you should be asking for forgiveness from the Greeks, instead of blaming us.

As for whether you consider us Europeans or not, I was just being sarcastic before.
Without wanting to be hostile, little difference does your opinion make to us, since the very word Europe is Greek.
Think about this: While in Europe of the 1700s people who questioned that the earth is flat got burnt alive, approximately 2000 years before that, ancient Greeks had already calculated our distance to the moon, the circumference of the earth, had instruments such as the Antikethera mechanism to visualize the orbits, had defined, and had an algorithm for, say, prime numbers, and so on.
Now it wouldn't make much sense to question the ""Europeanness"" of the original creators of Ευρώπη.

The most left ideology on the list is Democratic Socialism.

Glad you asked because I wasn't saying this at all. I was confronting the idea that the ""Europe"" identity sailed on the ""Christian (Catholic)"" (yes, you specifically said Catholic lol) boat in ""The Dark Ages"".

Ah yes, the old *Z ignored A, not A Z*.

He was enraged but decided to go shopping (expensive fabric sold on the streets of The City were non existent in Western Europe) and call it a day. His utter embarrassed was complete when on exiting the city gates all the goods were confiscated from him because the guards thought he and his people stole them.

Le débat est plutôt sur les plafonds et les pourcentages à imposer et les moyens à mettre en œuvre pour empêcher / détecter / punir les évasions fiscales.

Le problème c'est que de nombreux moyens s'offrent aux personnes qui souhaitent cacher de l'argent au fisc (paradis fiscaux) ou simplement alléger leurs impôts en faisant des investissements (niches fiscales) parce qu’il y a des gens qui peuvent y gagner de l'argent et que certains dispositifs sont détournés de leur fonction première.

Ensuite chacun voit la question de son point de vue personnel.

Pour simplifier : les ""pauvres"" aimeraient que les riches paient plus d'impôts parce qu’après tout, qui a besoin de gagner des dizaines de milliers d'euros par mois quand la plupart sont au salaire minimum ? Les ""riches"" ne veulent pas payer 80% de leurs revenus en impôts, parce qu’après tout si on peut prendre son argent et en garder beaucoup plus en déménageant dans un autre pays, pourquoi rester en France ?

Ce qui fait peur, si on durcit le traitement des plus riches, est de paraitre comme un pays qui n'encourage pas les gens à entreprendre et à être les meilleurs dans leurs domaines respectifs ...

true,Snoron,EURO,"Sandy Lane, Bradford, West Yorkshire, England, UK, EU, Earth","&gt; Maybe we shouldn't be messing with a technology of this potential when we don't fully understand every little detail.

Like how we've been messing with coal power for the last hundred years? Coal plants cause (amongst other crap) way more cancer than nuclear plants.

You say ""messing with"" as if we don't know what we're doing or don't understand the risks. Sure, I geuss we don't really. But at any given time we understand the risks better than we ever have, and we can make things safer than we ever have. If we're messing with nuclear power then we've been messing with everything else too for thousands of years, and if that's the case wthen so what? We're messing with wind and solar and tidal power too. We clearly don't know the full implications of anything we do, but we can base decisions on everything we know at a given time. With that in mind, nuclear is a good choice right now.

And with regards to Germany, here is the hypocrisy - the public seems to be so anti-nuclear, yet the country has been planning on building 20-30 new coal fired power plants, which people don't seem to mind so much. If that plan was for 20-30 nuclear plants everyone would be going nuts. And the supposed reason for people going nuts over that is all due to reasons (radiation, cancer, etc.) that are far worse with coal!

There is no logical explanation for that, it is just irrational fear that people have of nuclear power. The reason it's ""irrational"" is that people don't apply the problems with nuclear across the board - why aren't people discussing environmental damage of hydro and tidal? Nuclear does less. How about radiation and cancer from coal? Nuclear does less.

If Germans were more agaisnt coal than they are against nuclear then I would be able to take the arguments seriously, but everything I see and hear just points to some paranoid fear that makes no sense.

However: the big problem with nuclear power (as I said in another comment) is the one of storing/disposing of nuclear waste. That is a discussion/argument worth having, and that is where the only real problem lies.

&gt; nuclear technology has the potential for a catastrophe much graver than anything coal, solar, wind, fossil can possibly do.

Coal *is* more of a disaster than anything nuclear can possibly do.

Coal has killed more people, coal will keep killing more people. This is for certain.

Even *with* nuclear meltdowns, coal is still going to kill more people.

If the whole world ran on nuclear then less people would die for certain than if the whole world ran on coal. Even with a random nuclear disaster here and there.

It seems almost like the whole ""flying is safer than driving"" way of travelling argument - sure when a plane goes wrong it's very bad and ends in disaster - but you've still got less chance of dying if you travel by plane. Yet people have an irrational fear of flying, especially as they just sit in a seat and have no control over events. People feel this way about nuclear because they have scary thoughts in their heads, yet in reality they don't have any control over coal as it poisons them to death either - the difference is in the perception, not in the actual risk or damage.

But back to nuclear - if Chernobyl and Fukushima didn't happen, then public opinion would be much different in Germany, right? Yet it was known at the time that Chernobyl wasn't safe - and it's been known for years that Fukushima is not a safe design as well.

Running the old reactors around Europe today isn't safe and I am fully of the opinion that they should be shut down and replaced as a huge priority.

Maybe the biggest problem is that people don't trust the German government to keep them safe in the case that it became apparent that a nuclear plant there could be dangerous. Cost/risk analysis. Politics. Etc. They are scary things for sure and also the reason why we still have unsafe reactors dotted around the world.

But anyway, as I said I don't see how anyone sees building 30 coal plants as safer than biulding 30 nuclear. The technology isn't perfect, but it's good enough to ensure less deaths than coal. I don't get why people would knowningly sign their own death sentences like that once fully informed about the choices.

Also of course there's the other little problem - France could just end up with a load of cheap nuclear on the border and sell it to Germany. If Germany buys nuclear generated electricity then they are just as complicit as if they built it themselves anyway - plus all the same risks exist (even many of them to Germany), and I don't think exploiting other countries for your own safety is extremely ethical.

Anyway, she was talking to two young men, late teens early 20s (from the way they looked). They were telling her that they are working hard to make money and go to Greece, illegally of course through Turkey. They just needed the money to pay for it. It was a fortune for them but they had to do it. Their life would be so much better if they did.

So at that point the reporter asked but why Greece? Don't you know that things are so bad there blah blah, economic crisis, blah blah... 
Do you plan on staying there or go north to another country?

At which point they both started laughing and they said : You think Europe has problems? you think they have famine ? you think they have war ? Even if we get stuck in Greece compared to how we live here Greece is paradise. 

I was shocked because I realised at that point how these people must feel. It was weird for me, they knew it won't be easy, they knew they could end up dead, yet they preferred to take the risk over staying where they were. Probably because if they stayed they would have died anyway.

Currently very popular, beeing newly discovered by Israelis and Americans, is: Every Man Dies Alone or Alone in Berlin, it was fristly published in 1947 and became a bestseller english speaking countrys in 2009. I furthermore really enjoyed ""Bauern, Bonzen, Bomben"" (ie: Farmers, fat cats, bombs) and ""Ein Mann will nach oben"" but I think those aren't available in english. 


Another author I personally enjoy is Rafik Schami. He might in general not be the perfekt author to explain germany, but the ralation between the arabic world and the german/european. Schami is from damask and left Syria to life in germany. He writes in german. As I young gilr I read ""Die Sehnsucht der Schwalbe"" (The swallows desire) and fell in love.

Moreover, I think the book is both well written and engaging.  It is easy, when reading many histories, to lose track of the big picture amongst a sea of wars, battles, successions, and uprisings.  Because of this, this book not only manages to keep sight of the big picture, but also provides relevance by presenting German history from the perspective of a significant historical subgroup.  Also, despite the well worn subject material, this history still manages to present it in a manner that doesn't feel cliched or depressing.

Another reason that I appreciated this book was because it provided an interesting perspective on German culture.

If you're looking for less serious books, I can also recommend ""A Tramp Abroad"" by Mark Twain.

There are certainly plenty of old French songs featuring the accordion, but it's a stereotype to think that any modern French person would run into it on any regular basis (in much the same way as an average American probably doesn't know much about the banjo.)

I don't even disagree with the two example cases- that is, not being able to deport Abu Qatada back to Jordan, and requiring prisoners to be able to vote. I'd consider human rights and governance to be fundamental pillars of the European Union, alongside the Single Market.

Edit: I  thought I'd expand the discussion, because objection to the ECHR is a good starting off point to explain wider British recalcitrance in Europe. Arguably a declaration of human rights, or anything like it, requires popular legitimacy. i.e. that even if I think the ECHR and its implementation are good, and I think the rest of population should appreciate that, it's not sustainable to have a sizeable proportion object in the long term. 

And this is in some ways representative of the wider problem that Britain has with Europe, which is that the general population are simply not operating on the same wavelength as European authorities. People seem to be widely supportive of the principles of the ECHR, but don't know anything about the document itself, and only hear [scaremongering about mis-represented cases](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXM7DzeMLe4). And for many people there is not enough of a sense of legitimacy or trust in European institutions to bridge this gap. 

To explain the underlying causes for this, in turn:

* First, a failure of affinity and belonging, caused partly by differences in language and culture, partly by a bluff, dismissive attitude to those differences in parts of the British population and the British media (what some people would characterize as xenophobia). 

* Then, the failure of the EU to present itself with strong, compelling symbolism. Compare the Houses of Parliament, inside and outside*, with the European Parliament (wherever it is sitting that week) or the Old Bailey with the ECHR in Strasbourg.

* A lack of understanding, caused by the absence of education alongside the genuinely difficult-to-understand institutional structures (Council of Europe, European Council, Council of Ministers, Commission, ECJ, ECHR, Parliament, EEAA etc).

* Incomprehension at the genuine failings of the EU (40% of the budget spent on the CAP, [dumping with the CFP](http://www.fishfight.net/), those bizarre regulations which are actually true). 

All of this creates an amorphous sense of grievance which pollutes everything which the EU does, good or bad.

Why should prisoners have the right to vote? Genuinely curious why you'd think that. How is it a fundamental right of **prisoners**, of all people? To clarify, I mean prisoners that are in prison.

The whole **point** of prison is taking someone who has opted out of the social contract through crime, and removing them from that society until they've reformed. Why should they have a right to affect a world they're no longer part of during their incarceration? Once they're out, sure, but during?

Besides, it'd create a weird situation of politicians pandering to a prisoner voter base. They'd just vote for whoever promises to let them out earlier.

Except that you have. You've rejected society in committing the crime, and are being removed from society because of it. That's the entire point of the prison system.

Again, they've opted out of the social contract. That's what prison is **for**. We say to them 'You've broken societies laws, so we're going to remove you from society and its freedoms, make you see the error of your ways, then let you out'.

If you let them have every freedom inside that they have outside, then what's the point of prison at all?

In some ways the Nordic view on prisoners rights may seem lenient to other cultures, but I do think it's preferable to others. Your comments are shocking to me. Debating it wont change how either of us feel about this.  

That aside, I found [this](http://www.openeurope.org.uk/Content/Documents/PDFs/EUECHRprisoners.pdf) Prisoners’ right to vote: the blurred line between the 
European Convention on Human Rights and the European 
Union. 

Some points from it regarding the UK:  

""Prisoners are currently denied the right to vote in all elections in the UK, including 
general elections, European Parliament elections and local elections. The European 
Court of Human Rights has ruled that the UK’s “blanket ban” on prisoners is in 
violation of Article 3 of Protocol 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights. 
 

If the UK withdraws from the European Convention on 
Human Rights  it would certainly enable the UK to ignore the 
European Court’s ruling on prisoners’ rights to vote for general elections as they fall 
outside EU law and are purely a matter for the UK. But it is far from clear whether it 
would enable the UK to do so for local or European Parliament elections, as voting 
rights for these elections are covered by EU law as well as national law"".

German cabinet member Schaeuble asked, publicly, if it wouldn't be better to postpone Greek elections. Was he out of line? Sure. Did he ""shamelessly dictate when Greek elections should take place""? Hell no. Get a grip on reality.

I keep getting more and more convinced that the loud, visible part of Greek population is mainly this: a bunch of drama queens. You have some valid points hidden in those claims, like for example that the austerity measures shouldn't throttle the economy, as that would be counterproductive, but it' all drowned out by the **gigantic noise** produced by the overdramatic part of Greece. 

""But we are starving over here!"" is the response, more or less, I hear and read all the time. But you know what, I have Greek friends, maybe they're not totally representative since they're middle class, but from them I get the impression that the situation is bad, but nowwhere **near** as bad as the drama you perform implies.

Here's the cold, harsh truth: introduction of the Euro, cheap money from other EU members... lead to an unprecedented and, unfortunately unsustainable growth in Greek. Here's what I hope for: we make sure you don't starve, your hospitals stay open, your schools as well, etc. The EU should provide enought funding for that.

**But**, an important, ""your're not gonna like it"" but: your economy will shrink back to pre-bubble size. Your wages **will** go down. You **will** most likely go back to a more agrarian and tourism oriented country, and some of the more ""modern"" jobs in the cities will not survive. Sounds harsh, but that's how I see it.

EDIT:

Sorry, I just realized, I accused you of going on a rant, and then I do that kind of myself. I stand behind what I say above, but I should also note that, basically, your post just stated that you don't think Greeks should hate on Germans.

But it also said that ""we should blame the governments, not the people"", and that was the reason why I responded in the first place: the EU measures, the attempts by (among others) the German government are not perfect, maybe, but seriously, what is the alternative? 

Yes, reducing wages sucks, but as far as I know, at the moment many wages aren't even paid out any more? So what's better, higher wages that aren't even paid or lowered wages that have a chance of being sustainable?

The rich are somewhat richer than they were before, the poor are poorer, and the middle class is suffering but still has some funds, and is wondering what to do with them and how long they will last. That's my current level of understanding.

Now, what is a better way to handle the situation? I really would like to know? How is it Germany's (or the EU's) fault that there is one basic truth: you **must** reduce your budget deficit. You know that, right? There's zero way around that. Now, *how* you reduce it is another matter.

But you also know that it *wasn't* the EU (or Germany -- why does everyone always act as if Germany is the sole force in the EU, when in reality, they are maybe at most ""first among equal"" with France) asking for reducing minimum wage -- those were proposals by the Greek government to reduce the deficit. The EU just demands that the deficit is in fact lowered. How Greece does it: they don't care.

My points are simple: Don't use the EU as a scapegoat for what your government does. And don't use your government as a scapegoat if you don't have a better proposal either.

The same with Prosecution disclosure.   Strasbourg isn't bothered about it despite it being fundamental.

Take Amanda Knox in Italy.   It seems that mounting a vigorous defence is tantamount to slandering the prosecution for which she can get another ten years or something and I am unaware that Strasbourg is giving the Italians any grief over that.
