Genau so verwende ich ihn auch.

&gt; Faschismus „tendenziell nicht- oder auch antireligiös“ war

So ein Quatsch. Schon mal was von der Ustascha in Kroatien gehört? In den dortigen Konzentrationslagern [mordeten Mönche](http://www.heiligenlexikon.de/Literatur/Franziskaner_Pero_Bnica.html) und andere Kirchenmitglieder fleissig mit. Auch unter Franco und Salazar hat der Staat explizit die Nähe zur Kirche gesucht. Nach dem Ende des zweiten Weltkriegs [schleuste die katholische Kirche viele Faschisten und Kriegsverbrecher aus ganz Europa nach Südamerika](http://www.ila-bonn.de/artikel/ila301/rattenlinie.htm). 

Auch waren die Nazis nicht antireligiös. Sie wollten zwar die Macht der Kirchen schwächen, aber sie nicht abschaffen. Es gab unter Christen und in den Kirchen starke Unterstützung für Hitler. Siehe [Deutsche Christen](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Christen), [Reichskonkordat](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichskonkordat). Die Kirchen waren eine der Hauptkräfte, die den Antisemitismus schon lange gezielt gefördert hatten. Jesus wurde zum [arischen Widerstandskämpfer gegen Juden und Römer](http://www.humanist.de/kriminalmuseum/st-t3407.htm) umgedeutet.

Hitler ist nie aus der katholischen Kirche ausgetreten, [bezeichnete sich als Katholik](http://www.hansschauer.de/html/dir4/ch10t10u3.html) und war von Luther fasziniert. In Reden sprach er immer sehr gerne von der Vorsehung und benutzte religiös-mystische Wendungen.

Parallel dazu wurde eine neue religiöse Weltanschauung aufgebaut. Der Führer war den Deutschen als Erlöser von der Vorsehung geschickt worden. Seine heilige Schrift, Mein Kampf, lag in jedem Haushalt. Dazu kommt dann noch ein mystisch-germanisches Heidentum, wie es in Teilen der SS aufkam. Heldenverehrung, das Opfer des eigenen Lebens für Volk, Land und Führer erreichte sakrale Höhen. In Schulen, Kindergärten usw. wurden [täglich Hitlergebete](http://www.kindergartenpaedagogik.de/1258.html) durchgeführt. 

&gt; Händchen falten,
Köpfchen senken und
an Adolf Hitler (unseren Heiland) denken,
er gibt unser täglich Brot
und rettet uns aus jeder Not
Heil Hitler


Außenpolitisch wurden islamische Fundamentalisten vom den Nazis unterstützt. In der SS gab es sogar [eine ganze Division Muslime](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/13._Waffen-Gebirgs-Division_der_SS_„Handschar“_(kroatische_Nr._1)). 

&gt;Heinrich Himmler schwärmte für die weltanschauliche Verbundenheit zwischen Nationalsozialismus und dem Islam. Die Ideologie der Muslimbruderschaft (…) schien sich in einigen Punkten mit der der Nationalsozialisten zu decken

&gt; Der Großmufti sah ebenso wie Hitler eine ideologische Übereinstimmung und lobte während seines Aufenthalts in Berlin Hitler als einen „von der gesamten arabischen Welt bewunderten Führer“

true,thelittlebig,NISA,Niedersachsen,"Ok, the general political system you can just google/look up at wikipedia. Actually, this is my first and foremost tip, look shit up on wikipedia. The greatest collection of human knowledge ever created in history, access for free and with a friendly user interface only waits for you to use it. Do the same for the German schoolsystem. 

Second: There was a post here about German mannerisms, read that one, it was quite informative. 

Third: Spiegel.de has a lot of up to date news arcticles in English. The journalistic quality is usually an affront to the eyes of any educted beholder, but they hit a goldmine from time to time and churn out something worth reading.  

Fourth: Government propaganda that wasn't filtered by wikipedia is avaiable for free at www.deutschland.de/en. 

Fifth: Local infos, where are you going exactly? Google the shit out of that area. I did my exchange year in Northern Iowa and reading about life in New York wasn't helpfull at all.  

Sixth: When learning German pay attention to the genders of ALL THE THINGS! It is an annoying habit, but we Germans like it if foreigners know that a car is neutral, a bridge is female, and a bus is male. Although 99% of the population will probably be nice to you and more than glad to be able to help you practice your German, once they realize you want to learn. You see there is a big difference there. If tourists that are only in the country for 2 weeks try to ask me for information in German that is okay. If they insist on still trying out our language, even after they realize the extend of my knowledge of English I will get pissed off. There is no reason for people to butcher our language if they have no intention of learning it anyhow. Figure out how to use Sie/Du early (easy guide for starters: Sie for people with authority and older people, Du for people of your age).  

Seventh: I do not give a fuck that your uncle's sister's greataunt's mother came from Germany and no I probably don't know that family or little town where they had a farm. If it is relevant in anyway go ahead and tell the story, just don't use it as a conversation starter.

I brought this up because in my view the result of the study is biased by the way German media and many Germans in general cover these topics. Its just my opinion. Everything that's declared as anti-Semitic gets immediately linked to Israel and its citizens or the other way around. I'm not a fan of such undifferentiated views and I'm not a fan of mixing up religion, state, government and ethnicity. This article for example makes no difference between the term 'Semitic' and 'Jewish' maybe because the study of the so called 'experts' makes no difference. What would be if I decide to become religious and a follower of Judaism? Is anyone who would critic me in consequence an anti-Semite? 

&gt; the fact that you have to point fingers to cover you own flaws leads me to believe that you're part of the problem.

I don't think that I would have to cover flaws. I don't like religion at all and I don't like the guys in the Israeli government. Would Liebermann be a German the far right party NPD would welcome him as a member. Still if you try to criticise these guys you get called a anti-Semite in Germany. I'm not a anti-Semite, but according to this article I'm not sure whether these 'experts' really understand the difference. Otherwise I couldn't really explain myself how someone can come to the conclusion anti-Semitism would be deep-rooted here.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Seh ich ähnlich. Ich versuch mal mein eigenes 'walkthrough' hier zu verbildlichen:

&gt; 1. Existieren Ihrer Meinung nach bestimmte jüdische Charaktereigenschaften? Gibt es für Sie also etwas, das zwingend als «typisch jüdisch» bezeichnet werden kann?

Wie soll man sowas beantworten? Jede religiöse gruppe hat eine charakter-eigenschaft, welche die gewählte religion ""verraten"" kann. Diese zu addressieren ist schwierig, und nahezu unmöglich ohne dabei zumindest teilweise als ""hassend"" zu wirken. Ich glaub dass diese frage eher eine kontrollfrage ist, um zu testen, ob man den fragebogen eigentlich ernst nimmt. Persönlich würde ich mich weigern solch eine frage zu beantworten, da sie ziemlich geladen wirkt.

&gt; 2. Glauben Sie, man sehe einem Menschen an, dass er jüdisch ist?

Für israelische juden mag das durchaus zutreffen, aber sowas kann man einfach nicht generalisieren. Der film ""EUROPA - EUROPA"", welcher von einem jüdischem jungen handelt, der sich als nazi ausgibt um der verfolgung zu entziehen, beweist dies: Denn der junge wurde nie geschnappt, und wurde zeremoniell in die HJ aufgenommen. Alle gingen einfach davon aus dass er nicht jüdisch sei.

&gt; 3. Wenn Sie einem Juden gegenüber eine Behauptung über sein Volk äussern, die er mit vernünftigen und logischen Argumenten widerlegen kann, bestehen Sie dann auf Ihrer Behauptung, auch wenn Sie sie nicht beweisen können? Gehen Sie in solchen Fällen davon aus, dass dieser Jude nur versucht, eine unangenehme Wahrheit zu verschleiern?

Welcher trottel würde denn in so einem fall auch versuchen die eigene meinung breitzutrampeln, wenn diese auf logische und sensible art widerlegt wurde? Fräulein common sense lässt grüssen.

&gt; 4. Angenommen, Sie haben einen jüdischen Vermieter. Würden Sie ihn verdächtigen, Ihnen eine zu hohe Miete zu berechnen?

Nein. Kurz und knapp, nein.

&gt; 5. Angenommen, in Ihrem Haus zieht eine jüdische Familie ein. Würden Sie davon ausgehen, dass Ihre neuen Nachbarn lärmiger sein werden als eine nichtjüdische Familie?

Ebenfalls, nein. Solch eine vermutung ist, offen gesagt, hirnrissig.

&gt; 6. Glauben Sie, die heute lebenden Juden schlügen auf irgendeine Weise Vorteil aus dem Holocaust?

Ich weiss dass ich für folgende worte als antisemit bezeichnet werde, aber offen gesagt, sehe ich dieses verhalten in englisch-sprachigen foren ziemlich oft: Sobald die argumente zu neige gehen, wird auf den holocaust zurückgegriffen, um die eigene meinung zu verstärken. Und wer es dann immernoch wagt zu widersprechen, ist ein ganz dolle pöhser nazi. Auf deutschsprachigen webseiten/foren hab ich sowas bisher aber noch nie beobachten können. Ist aber selbstverständlich nur erfahrungssache, aber manche tun sowas einfach.

&gt; 7. Glauben Sie, die Juden der Vergangenheit hätten in irgendeiner Weise zu ihrer Verfolgung beigetragen? Ist der Holocaust in Ihren Augen also zu gewissen Teilen eine logische Konsequenz?

Nein. Der holocaust ist das produkt einer wahnsinnigen Idee.

&gt; 8. Erklären Sie sich das bisweilen durchaus fragwürdige Verhalten der israelischen Regierung damit, dass es eine mehrheitlich jüdische Regierung ist?

Selbstverständlich, schliesslich ist der krieg im nahost ein hauptsächlich religiöser krieg. Jeder mit augen und ohren kann das sehen und hören.

&gt; 9. Wenn Sie von einem erfolgreichen Menschen erfahren, dass er Jude ist, deuten Sie dies als einen Beweis für seinen Erfolg?

Man könnte auch fragen, ""Wenn sie einen polen in einem auto sehen, denken sie dann, dass das auto gestohlen wurde?"" - kurzum, wieder eine sehr geladene frage. Aber meine antwort würde Nein lauten.

&gt; 10. Nehmen Sie im Nahostkonflikt Partei gegen die Israelis und freuen Sie sich, wenn diese zu Schaden kommen, oder sind Sie zumindest der Ansicht, es geschehe ihnen recht?

Mir ist der frieden lieb und teuer. Das gilt für beide seiten gleichermaß.

Right wing violence:

    Attempted homicide:   6  
    Violent assault:    638  
    Arson:               29

Left wing violence:

    Attempted homicide:   4  
    Violent assault:    541  
    Arson:               81

A large share of those attacks are aimed at political opponents from the respective other side. For assault, the figures are 232 for right- against left wingers (263 against foreigners), and 308 the other way round.

So, yes, the right wing tends to be more violent, but the left comes much closer than one would expect.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"I had wondered how they had arrived at the 20% figure and whether their metrics even were comparable to those from the other countries mentioned, so I had a look at [the study](http://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Themen/Politik_Gesellschaft/EXpertenkreis_Antisemmitismus/bericht.pdf?__blob=publicationFile) (thanks, [tekai](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/osvd4/bbc_news_german_antisemitism_deeprooted_in_society/c3jx9xa)). It's in German, and I suspect many here are asking themselves the same question, so below is what this is based on. Beginning on page 64, table 17, they include the questions in English, I've added translations for others at the bottom of this post.

It's not an exact measurement, the 20% value is more like a ballpark figure to give you an impression of what the scale of the problem is. It's based on a series of questions that relate to the classic stereotypes and conspiracy theories. Since there is no way to weight questions about ""having disproportional influence"", ""are partially to blame for anti-Semitism"" or ""play the Holocaust card to their advantage"" (paraphrasing, not actual quotes) against each other, and that there is no clear line between being prejudiced and being a proper anti-Semite, this does make some sense. Some are way below that 20% figure, some are well beyond. Others, like about equating Israel with Jews in general or its policies regarding Palestinians with that of the Nazis, had a lot of ""support"" but appear to have been entirely disregarded.

The impression I got was that, overall, 20% appears to be fair. If I had to give an estimate, based on those answers, it's probably what I would have said, in the sense that 10% definitely seems to be too low, and 30% too high. 

Anyway, translations for the other questions that the international comparison is based on, from page 63:

\11.) ""Jews have too much influence in [country].""

\12.) ""Jews in general don't care about anything or anybody except for their own group.""

\13.) ""Jews today attempt to get an advantage out of having been the victims during the Nazi period.""

\14.) Negation of the statement: ""Jews enrich our culture.""

\15.) ""With Israel's policy, I can well understand if somebody doesn't like the Jews.""

\16.) ""Israel is leading a war of extermination against the Palestinians.""

Regarding the political system, Germany is a federation of 16 states. We use a system of ""personified"" proportional representation, meaning that you get two votes, one for a person as a local representative (the ""direct mandate"", simple majority in the district wins) and one for a party, which determines the overall distribution of seats in the parliament. Parties need to pass the ""5% hurdle"" to enter.  
Parties then go on to try and form a coalition that, together, controls a majority of the seats and get the votes to elect the chancellor (unlike the US, where the president is also the head of government, Germany has separate rolls for the heads of state and government).   

Your timing is pretty good, because there will be federal elections in September or October of 2013. You'll always find the most recent polls [here](http://www.spiegel.de/flash/0,5532,21034,00.html).  
Air time for political ads gets assigned, based on previous results, and can't be bought. As a consequence, there aren't that many TV ads. Parties are much less reliant on donations, although they do get some, but predominantly draw their finances from membership fees and government reimbursement for the campaigns that again is based on the election result.  
It will be rather different from what you'll go through in the US this year, and might be interesting to watch, if you're into politics.

Much of how your experience will be depends on where you will be going. Keep in mind that Germany used to consist of [many tiny independent countries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:HRR_1789_EN.png) until not too long ago, and there still are very noticeable cultural differences.

true,yannickmahe,FRAN,France,"The question that needs to be debated, is whether it is up to politicians to handle History. It is especially troubling that a country would give itself the right to make laws about the history of two others countries.

An other rather big issue is the fact that this law is blatantly unconstitutionnal. The only reason it has been voted is because of a big push by Armenian associations. This law will be knocked down by the constitutionnal council, and the MPs that voted on it know it ; all this affair is just blatant political pandering to whichever community is largest in the MP's constituency.

Finally, Turkey and Armenia are slowly rebuilding relations. Every time a country (usually France...) does something like that, that delicate situation gets more strenuous.

I don't doubt the veracity of the historical reports of the genocide. But, like with Japan's attitude towards its history in World War II, we have to accept that difference and hope they will move towards recognition. Every time a foreign power tries to tell another country about its own history, things get complicated.

The first part is true, but nobody mentions Jews. Jewish people in Hungary are on both sides of this debate. Although the left tries to monopolize themselves as being anti-fascists and thus generally paint anyone else as anti-Semite.

For example, the poll she publishes is questionable. It is well known that Ipsos is close to the Socialists, and does polls on their behalf. Its also well known (there was an article about it), that they always do biased reports, which are leaning to show the Socialists in positive and Fidesz in negative light. There are 3 other polling companies, one of them has published results which shows that contrary to the Ipsos poll, Fidesz has not lost its supporters, and would still win by landslide if elections were held right now. 

What she (or rather her Hungarian source) is doing, is to post these subtle twists as absolute truths. None of these alone prove anything to either side, but if nicely collected, like in her series, then it does sway the readers opinion.

Frankly I resent your attempt to make protecting freedom of speech into an insult of those who perished. That's a despicable way of arguing.

When you censor free speech you have to think through what the consequences are. Who decides what is to be banned? In this case it is the parliament. Who is the parliament responsible to? The PMs are responsible to their voters. As such allowing parliament to ban free speech amounts to the majority being able to silence the minority.

Do I have to remind you that it was not long ago that blasphemy or homosexuality was illegal? 

We cannot let such a crucial thing as freedom of speech be contingent on the whims of the majority. Even if that means allowing opinions that are uncomfortable.

As to Iran, of course I am not making a direct comparison. I am making a comparison in the arguments made for censoring free speech, which are the same, but in different degrees. The only way you can justify censoring other people is because you subjectively think that what they're saying is wrong. It's the same thing in Iran, except that they subjectively think that criticising Islam and the state is wrong too. You are banning speech on a subjective perception that something is wrong. As I noted this is also why blasphemy and homosexuality was once banned in our societies. Because a majority subjectively thought it was wrong.

No it isn't. It is an opinion that a factual event is wrong.

It is reprehensible to ban someone from having an opinion and stating it, no matter how factually wrong or immoral it might be. 

And where are you going to draw the line? When you give the state the power to say that this event is so factual that it is illegal to state otherwise, you give the state the power to write history. One might imagine that the French state would have found it practical to do that with regards to crimes in Indochina or Algeria.

I blame the fast and cheap internet in Hungary. Every senile pensioner and any bum can get a fast and cheap internet connections. They are also allowed to express their foul opinion for the sake of free speech. They have a lot of free time, so their comments are all over.

And when the government makes a law, to require from the most notorious anti-Semite portal to reveal its operator (which is possibly a link to the far right Jobbik party), then it is accused of hampering free speech and internet media, by the left and by the EU.

One more point: the bigger the hysteria, the more people will step over to the far-right. Bashing Hungary with liberal arguments, yelling the fascist accusation into peoples faces will cause them to indeed go over to the far-right. This tendency has been proven over the years, and it has been proven in multiple local elections.

But I find that the main problem is not the lack of public funding for research (although obviously that is a problem too). It's more of a cultural thing. Most Spanish companies do not see the advantages of R&amp;D (like they don't see the advantages of marketing either). For them that's like trashing money. This situation created a huge gap between academic investigation and the companies that is getting bigger and bigger as time goes by.

As a result, investigators pretty much don't care anymore about the potential applications of their projects. And the departments of the universities just try to get as much money as they can to survive, meaning that lots of projects have just the absolute minimum content to justify the assigned money. Things like ""we still have xxx euros left for this year, we need to find some friend to make us a project on this topic in the 2 months we have before end of the year"" are not unheard of.

Universities tried to react to this problem by creating spin-off challenges and the famous ""technology transfer"" departments. But in the end it's about giving money to friends (I saw once a spin-off ""innovation project"" winner that was about refilling ink cartridges - they just called it ""recycling"" instead of ""refilling"" - the rest was the same you could do in any cartridge shop), and having friends working in public companies give you some R&amp;D money with no other aim than making you a favor.",0,1327404423,null,0,true,0,c3k3j4o,t3_oss20,t1_c3k3j4o,t3_oss20,null,1428230400,1,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,1

Hell no. You can think, and even say to yourself, whatever [you damn well please](http://www.thelocal.de/society/20111223-39695.html).

&gt; ""Ah, that will be £29,000 and a stay in prison.""

No, it won't:

&gt; (3) Whosoever publicly or in a meeting approves of, denies or downplays an act committed under the rule of National Socialism of the kind indicated insection 6 (1) of the Code of International Criminal Law, in a manner capable of disturbing the public peace shall be liable to imprisonment of not more than five years or a fine.

&gt; (4) Whosoever publicly or in a meeting disturbs the public peace in a manner that violates the dignity of the victims by approving of, glorifying, or justifying National Socialist rule of arbitrary force shall be liable to imprisonment of not more than three years or a fine.

""Not believing"" is not the same as ""denying"". It's, in fact, a huge difference, and not capable of disturbing the public peace. Also, people don't choose to believe, they'd say things like ""I can't believe that"", which makes your example highly artificial.

**Transporte público**

En primer lugar, si vas a utilizar el transporte público con frecuencia, para ir y volver de tu escuela o facultad, por ejemplo, cómprate el Abono de Transportes (47,60€ al mes), que te permite viajar ilimitadamente en Metro, trenes de Cercanías y autobuses dentro de los límites de Madrid. Te será mucho más cómodo y seguramente más barato que el Metrobús, un billete de 10 viajes que vale 9,30€ y que tendrás que picar cada vez que cambies de autobús o entre Metro y autobús (no es válido en Cercanías).

El Abono de Transportes consta de una tarjeta (con tu nombre y foto) y un cupón (que es el billete en sí, que es válido para cada mes natural). La tarjeta te costará 1,20€ y la puedes comprar en los [estancos](http://www.google.es/search?q=estanco&amp;um=1&amp;hl=es&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og) (tiendas de tabaco). El cupón se compra en las estaciones de Metro.

**Museos**

Si te interesa el arte te gustarán mucho los museos de Madrid. Madrid tiene tres grandes museos de arte bastante cercanos entre sí, que se llaman en conjunto el [Triángulo del Arte](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triángulo_del_Arte) de Madrid.

* El [Museo del Prado](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museo_del_Prado). Es un museo enorme (no podrás verlo entero en un sólo día) basado en la antigua colección real, con grandes obras de arte europeo del siglo XII al XIX. También es la mayor colección de arte español del mundo. La entrada cuesta 12€, pero si tienes menos de 26 años y puedes demostrar que eres estudiante (con tarjeta de tu Universidad) puedes entrar gratuitamente. Otra alternativa para ir gratis es ir de martes a sábado de 18:00 a 20:00 o el domingo de 17:00 a 20:00.

* El [Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museo_Thyssen-Bornemisza). Es un museo basado en la colección privada de los barones Thyssen-Bornemisza. Su temática se solapa con la del Prado, pero también incluye algunas obras del siglo XX. La entrada son 9€, pero con tarjeta de estudiante te saldrá a 6€.

* El [Museo Reina Sofía](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museo_Nacional_Centro_de_Arte_Reina_Sofía). Es un museo de arte moderno, donde encontrarás entre otros el famoso [Guernica](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guernica_\(painting\)). La entrada son 6€ y es gratuita para estudiantes universitarios o de lunes a viernes de 19:00 a 21:00, el sábado de 14:30 a 21:00 y el domingo de 10:00 a 14:30.

**Restaurantes**

En Madrid, como en cualquier gran ciudad, puedes encontrar restaurantes de todo tipo y de todo rango de precios. Si quieres un restaurante barato, los restaurantes chinos suelen ser una buena opción. Mira también los sitios que tengan [""Menú del Día""](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men%C3%BA_del_d%C3%ADa) a buen precio. Si estás en una zona turística y en un restaurante ves más extranjeros que españoles, es casi seguro que no vale la pena. Y si un retaurante tiene un menú que pone precio a las ""tapas"", ¡huye de él como del demonio! (explicación más abajo).

Desgraciadamente, no conozco muchos restaurantes en Madrid, así que no te puedo recomendar muchos. En términos generales, si quieres comer bien, los restaurantes con apariencia más ""tradicional"" suelen estar mejor. Dos buenas opciones son el mesón [El Lacón](http://g.co/maps/n4h3d) (no intentes verlo en Street View, Google se ha equivocado de fotos) y el restaurante [Los Amigos](http://g.co/maps/hd773).

En España no estás obligado a dejar propina como en los Estados Unidos. A no ser que seáis un grupo muy grande, puedes irte sin dejar nada de propina y no hay problema. Sin embargo, si te sientes generoso, puedes dejar algo (un 5% o un 10%). Si dejas tanta propina como en EEUU les sorprenderá mucho, pero seguro que te lo agradecen.

**Cañas, tapas y terrazas**

Una de las mayores tradiciones en Madrid (y en buena parte de España) es ""irse de cañas"" o ""irse de tapas"" (casi es lo mismo) por la tarde noche (a partir de las 19:00, digamos). Una caña es un vaso pequeño de cerveza (entre 20cl y 33cl), y una tapa es una pequeña cantidad de comida que _te dan gratis_ con la bebida. He resaltado ""gratis"" porque es importante: las tapas tradicionalmente no se cobran, pero por algún motivo muchos turistas creen que las tapas se pagan. Evita los sitios que ponen precio a las ""tapas"", porque eso son _tourist traps_.

Es típico ir en un grupo pequeño a una cervecería con tapas (las hay que no dan tapa), ir pidiendo rondas de cañas y comer las tapas que van llegando. Normalmente las cañas cuestan entre 1€ y 2€ (en terraza son más caras). Realmente cualquier bar tradicional pone tapas, pero pueden ser desde muy sencillas (patatas fritas, aceitunas) hasta bastante elaboradas. Un buen sitio para _tapear_ es el Bar [Los Amigos](http://g.co/maps/hd773) justo en frente del restaurante que te dije antes o, si quieres tapas enormes, el bar [El Tigre](http://g.co/maps/guuqf). 

Si con las tapas no es suficiente, puedes pedir _raciones_, que suelen ser la misma comida que las tapas pero más abundantes (y sí se pagan). Lo normal es compartirlas entre varias personas. Algunas raciones típicas son:

* Tortilla española (o de patata): una tortilla (_omelette_, no tortillas mexicanas) gruesa de patata y cebolla (si es un _pincho_ de tortilla en vez de una _ración_, es para una sola persona)  
* Patatas bravas: patatas fritas/asadas con salsa picante (no mucho).  
* Patatas ali-oli: patatas hervidas con salsa de aceite y ajo.  
* Boquerones (=anchoas) fritos o en vinagre.  
* Calamares a la romana: Anillos de calamar empanados y fritos.  
* Chipirones, chopitos: Pequeños calamares fritos.  
* Pimientos del padrón: pequeños pimientos verdes hechos a la plancha con sal gorda. En un mismo plato, la mayoría no pican pero unos pocos sí.  
* Jamón serrano: parecido al prosciutto italiano, pero mucho mejor :-P. Si dice ""ibérico"" es de la máxima calidad, y seguramente será mucho más caro.  
* Chorizo: una especie de salchicha curada ligeramente picante. Puede ser chorizo _frito_ o simplemente embutido.  
* Morcilla: una salchicha hecha con sangre de cerdo y arroz o cebolla. Normalmente se sirve frita o a la parrilla. 
* Pulpo a la gallega (o con cachelos): Pulpo con pimentón (paprika ahumada) y patatas. Algo más caro que lo anterior, pero muy rico.  
* Langostinos a la plancha: Un langostino es una gamba grande (como un _prawn_). Muy ricos y sabrosos, pero también caros.  

**Deportes, ocio, tiempo libre**

Madrid tiene muchos grandes parques donde puedes practicar deporte al aire libre. Quizá los cuatro más importantes son el Retiro, la Casa de Campo, el Parque del Oeste y el Parque Juan Carlos I (o Campo de las Naciones).

* [El Retiro](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jardines_del_Retiro_de_Madrid) es un gran parque en el centro de Madrid que antiguamente era unos jardines de la Familia Real. Cuando hace buen tiempo, y especialmente los sábados y los domingos, verás muchísima gente que va allí a pasear con la familia, a montar en bicicleta, a patinar, a remar en el estanque o hacer un picnic sobre la hierba.
* [La Casa de Campo](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casa_de_Campo) es un parque _enorme_ (5 veces más grande que el Central Park de Nueva York) que está al oeste del centro y que llega hasta la frontera de la ciudad. Era antiguo terreno de caza de la Familia Real, y es prácticamente un bosque mediterráneo salvaje. Puedes pasear por ahí en bicicleta y sentir que estás en el campo. La Casa de Campo también contiene el Zoológico, el Parque de Atracciones, un Lago artificial donde puedes remar, una piscina pública y un teleférico (cable-car) que le conecta con el Parque del Oeste.  
* [El Parque del Oeste](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parque_del_Oeste) también vale la pena visitarlo. Contiene el edificio más antiguo de Madrid, que tiene más de 2000 años (realmente hacemos trampa, es el [Templo egipcio de Debod](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Templo_de_Debod) :-P ). Desde el templo hay muy buenas vistas al noroeste de Madrid y a la [Sierra de Guadarrama](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_de_Guadarrama). Ve ahí a ver el atardecer.
* El [Parque Juan Carlos I](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parque_Juan_Carlos_I) está lejos del centro, cerca del aeropuerto. Es un parque de estilo moderno donde también podrás montar mucho en bicicleta y tener buenas vistas de Madrid. Me parece que la gente suele volar cometas (_kites_) ahí. Está muy cerca del [Parque del Capricho](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parque_de_El_Capricho) que tiene unos horarios muy raros pero es de las mejores joyas de Madrid (y muy desconocido). Mira los horarios en la temporada que estés y visítalo.

**Otras cosas**

Ya que estás en Madrid, aprovecha para visitar [Segovia](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segovia) y [Toledo](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toledo), dos ciudades preciosas a menos de 30 minutos en tren desde Madrid o 1 hora y poco en autobús (a Segovia también puedes ir en un tren más barato pero más lento). 

También puedes ir en tren a la [Sierra de Guadarrama](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_de_Guadarrama), donde puedes disfrutar de la montaña y de la naturaleza. La manera más sencilla de llegar es coger el tren de Cercanías a Cercedilla. Creo que tarda menos de una hora.

I'd like to add that what you are saying is horseshit.  You can debate about the history involved and people do all the time; what you cannot do is publish a paper or article claiming that these events didn't happen, spreading misinformation about something that people need to know about as it is integral to their history.  I don't know enough about the Turkish/Armenian conflict and genocide to comment, but it is utterly, utterly mental to deny the systematic extermination of millions upon millions of civilians by the Nazis because they were jewish, gay or whatever.  

Someone spreading doubt on well-established facts for no other reason than being crazy, bigotted or anti-semitic will have a detrimental effect on the generations that did not experience war or the holocaust first hand.  Basically, and I don't like making this comparison because it'll leave me open to criticism as a bleeding-heart liberal who wants to coddle the population (plus it's not a great analogy but I can't think of any other right now), it is essentially insighting hatred: ""Those jews, faggots, gypsies, jehovah's witnesses are bleeding us dry, trying to make us feel bad, demanding reparations, memorials and in some cases even rights!  Hitler didn't have *that* many killed, it's all a bullshit conspiracy blabla spew shit twattalk, we should go back to the good old days.""   The fear here of this happening is very real, part the youth of today is totally disenchanted with its leadership and likes leaning towards the far right. The things they say and do (shouting Sieg heil's with Nazi salutes on a visit to Auschwitz etc) scare the shit out of the older generations here because they remember that it started with this kind of teasing and dehumanising.  Not to mention that this shit is classic material for neo-nazis as well.

I don't want to take away anybody's right to offend, call them what you want and tell them what you want, and think what you want about the people I mentioned and all the other victims.

I can tell you this on the internet because, in the end, it's pretty unlikely that anything will happen to me. Same goes for holocaust denial.

The point is that holocause denial, at its base, is not a subjective matter, it is arguing about something that happened.

Yes!  Even some basic knowledge goes a long way.  If you are in a touristy area, chances are that a lot of people will speak English, but it's still very much appreciated if you put forth some effort!

Oktoberfest?  Pretty expensive (watch out for hotel rates and book early!).  Other times of the year?  It should be pretty reasonable compared to the Pound.  Expect to pay a little more on the prepared food and a little less on beer and fresh fruits and veggies.  Restaurants are about the same.

You won't need German during the Oktoberfest. Don't worry, you won't get arrested as long as you're not making trouble, are violent or super-annoying. It is a beer fest after all, everyone's getting drunk.

Here's the most important thing about Oktoberfest though: Once you have a seat in a tent, DO NOT MOVE! I've heard so many stories from people thinking ""Oh, this tent is nice, let's go check out another one"" that never got into any tents after that. Once you're sitting somewhere, do not leave. If you can get into the tents (i.e. no bouncers or bouncers letting you in) but you can't find a seat go ask they waitresses as they'll certainly be helpful. I remember asking a million people whether the seats were taken and we couldn't sit down anywhere. Then a waitress approached us and asked whether we're searching for a seat. We said yes and she led us to a table.

The huge march on the weekend was exactly because of articles like this. Hungarians want to be left in peace, we don't deserve to  be called ""fascists"" or ""authoritarians"". If there are technical issues with new laws, that can be solved in the EU institutions like with any other EU country.

For solving that, the EU doesn't need to get into our faces, and the liberal media doesn't need to make a case with lies.

- Do not steal the beer steins. The security guards this really well.
- Munich doesn't really have ""bad areas"" when compared to other cities of that size. There's a reason expats call it ""Toytown Munich"".
- Sure German helps, but it is not needed. You score brownie points if you know some Bavarian phrases though. Example: ""Hoppauf"" (bottoms up), ""Servus!"" (Hi!) and ""Oachkatzlschwoaf"" (a squirrel's tail - trust me on that one).

Supermarkets

- Go to : Dia, Lidl, Eroski, Alcampo, Carrefur, Mercadona

- Avoid : Sanchez romero, Opencor, Hipercor, Supermercados el corte ingles. 

Bars and restorants are nice but find the right bar like el tigre or la blanca paloma and you will basicly come out stuffed like a turkey at the cost of 2-3 beers. I also suggest you visit chueca, The area behind sol-plaza major, funcarreal. La Latina, The san miguel and san anton food markets (the plaza de chueca has my favorite ice cream place in the middle of it)
You should really also check out Mercado maravillas close to cuatro caminos. 

I´t kind of depends on if the place you´re staying at has a decent usable kitchen. 

Get a Rail pass its a must for moving around the city. its expencive and can bleed you dry if you live in the outskirts. it costs 48 for central madrid and can go up to 112 euros if you live in lost in the country. but it allows you access to all EMT busses. Rail and metro. 

Madrid has 3 forms of transport. 

EMT : Red or blue buses which are semi decent. only use if you know that the specific bus that you know passes where you need. They circulate between 6am and 23:00, Theres also a series a buses called Buhos (owl), these circulate to most places in madrid between 23:30pm and 6am, they allow you to go home when you´re totaly fucked up around 3-4am, 

Metro : Goes basicly everywhere but can get a bit slow once in a while becuase basicly it also stops everywhere. This is the inner city rail system to madrid. its quite basic to use and the lines are quite set. you dont need to pass tickets again to change between lines. The metro usualy closes down at around 1:30 am

Cercanias : this is the outer train system to madrid which is usualy used to travel between the city and suburbs. but since it has a large ammount of stops inside the city it allows you to leapfrog specific distances that would take longer in bus or metro. for example i live close to the northen central rails station (chanmartin), if i took the bus or metro it would take me close to 45 minutes to reach sol. the cercanias lets me do chanmartin -&gt; sol in 8 minutes. 

Cars... if you want to go to the city center or live in the city center a car is a liability. Gasoline is right now at 1.48€ a Liter, thats $7.20 a gallon. Parking by day will cost you money, parking by night will cost you sanity and blood. 

Take in to account that there are also green buses which are not part of the EMT and your rail pass will not be accepted there. these are mostly buses that go to subrubs and rarly go to places inside madrid. 

And i cant say this enough times. TAKE CARE OF YOUR PASS. it will not be replaced if lost or destroyed. you will need to buy another. i lost mine once mid month and had to spend the rest of the month on 10 use passes (9.30€ each)

Places you should know :

- Moncloa : nice place and bar zone  use to be famous becuase it was where all the neonazis went drinking but its not that bad anymore. 

- Arguelles : its near moncloa and quite nice, more of a rock attitude. 

- Alonso martines : this is where the teens go drinking. mostly highschoolers and first year university students. a bit of a light party attitude.

- Tribunal/Malasaña : this is where the older uni students go. i still go there and im 30, more of an alternative rock attitude but depends on where you go. 

- La latina : a more mature going out place for people in their late 20´s early 30´s, quite nice with a alternative vibe and a place for everyone. much more relaxed

- Huertas : a nice zone behind sol, alot of interesting bars and isnt much age specific but its hard to find someone under 22-23 there. 

Most bars will close at 3-3:30 becuase of noise regulations but places with club licenses can stay open till 6am, just remember to get there before 3am becuase they start charging enterance fee. 

Places to visit:

Consider most of the museums are free in the weekend afternoons. So check out the reina sofia and the prado. Also check out the obras sociales which are nice (many banks have to donate same of their earnings to social and cultural causes. so many have small art expos). 

Templo debod, Plaza oriente, campo de moro, plaza mayor, the botanical gardens, the museums, la latina, el rastro, the list is quite long and theres alot of places listed in this thread. 

Check out the 27 bus once you have your rail pass, it basicly goes up the main avenue of madrid between plaza castilla which is walking distance from Chanmartin (northen central rail station) and Atocha (southen central rail station). it pases through all the famous round abouts. the central mail which has just been refurbished as the new city hall. the prado museum, the retiro park, Nuevos ministerios. and many other land marks. 

As for crime, in the city center theres little street crime, but still there is some, i know it sounds racist but avoid romanian gypsies. they are mostly pickpockets and profesional beggers. in places like sol or plaza mayor they also go around in organized bag pulling/pickpocketing teams. 

Also when in a bar keep your stuff close by and with an eye on it. we allready had a case where this woman came in ""to use the bathroom"" picked up a friends bag and just walked out with it. 

Aslong as you dont do stupid shit or get too careless you should be fine. a friend of mine from venezuela was surprised there were people still on the street at 3 am and people usualy go out till 6am on the weekends. 

Its a great city. you just have to find the little tricks to it. 

Also... 
Spain has 4 mobile networks and a crap load of virtual service providers. 
All you need to do is check which one fits you best. i would tell you to look at Pepephone, Simyo and Yoigo. 
You can get a basic phone for calls and texting at any supermarket from 30 euros. if you want a smart phone you´re gonna have to look a bit further but you can check out a chain called the phone house. they usualy have some sort of ""ultimas unidades"" which are kits they are liquidating. you just have to go early in the month to make sur they have stock. 

Remember that US phones while GSM might have different operational frequencies. Spanish GSM networks run at 900/1800mhz.

&gt;Where is best to stay and where to avoid?

Just some random numbers. A friend of my works at one of the hostels near Hauptbahnhof (central station). Their normal rate for a 4-bed dorms is 27€ per room, during the Oktoberfest it's 75€ per Person.
You should book a hotel or hostel in the cities nearby that have direct lines to Munich. For example, Bad Tölz is 55km south of Munich (about 1 hour ride), the train goes right to central station every hour until 1 o' clock. A group ticket for 5 persons costs 35€ and is valid for the whole day. Last year, I booked a hotel for some friends from Berlin. They stayed in a nice hotel for 28€. They had no stress getting to Munich and saved a shit load of money. 

&gt;What are the dos and don'ts? It's a drinking holiday, and I don't want to end up in a cell. Is English-style binge-drinking going to get me arrested?

Dos: Have fun, be nice, don't act stupid, don't hit on girls that have the apron knot on the right (they have a boyfriend or husband), tip the waiter. A good tip on the first Maß ensures that the waiter will return frequently. Bad tip and you will never see him/her again. And finally EAT something. The beer on the Oktoberfest is stronger and kicks like a mule. I've see so many Brits, Aussies and Americans failing because they didn't eat anything. 

Don'ts: Never ever fuck with the bouncers or with the cops. They are specially trained and know all the tricks and are usually not in the mood for discussions. Don't try to steal a beer stein. The bouncers will beat the shit out of you and afterwards you get arrested by police. Some bouncers build pyramids with the beer steins they've confiscated as a sign of warning and last year I saw a pyramid that was at least 2m high. Don't go on the weekends. It's pure chaos. Come from monday to thursday and you can easily get a seat inside a tent until 4 o' clock. If you're inside, don't go out unless you have no intention of coming back. 

&gt;How expensive will I find Germany compared to England?

On the Oktoberfest a 1liter of beer is around 9 to 9.7€. An average meal is 13 to 18€. In the city the prices range from 3.2€ per pint to 4.2€ per pint depending where you go. If you go to a supermarket or beer store, a normal beer costs about 0.76€ per 0.5l.

And now something that might be useful for everyone.
It is not true that you have to pay for reservation. You can reserve a table in March to April. I've reserved one or 2 tables for the last 5 years in the Hacker tent. The minimum amount of seat is 10 which is one full table. There is no reservation fee, BUT you have to pre-order  beer and food tickets (Bier- und Hendlmarken). Minimum pre-order is 2 beer (or soft drink) and 1 hendl (or general food ticket for 15€) per seat. You have to pay in advance. The good thing is that you get tickets that bring you into the tent, no matter how crowded it is. You enter through a separate entrance. There are 3 reservation times: 9-12, 12-5 and 5 to 10. The evening and weekend reservation are companies and long time customers only. The reservation can be made online on the following site

Except that the part of the holocaust that is being denied is not a *general* matter.  You can't say that in general, between 50,000 and 6,000,000 jewish people were murdered.  They are very deliberately spreading lies and actively trying to sew confusion.  If they genuinely don't believe it happened - which I'm sure is probably the case for most of these 'historians' - they will have to bring forth arguments that are a lot better than ""it's impossible to kill so many people in six/seven years"" and zany cover-up / faking stories.  

Besides which, you're implying that we throw them into jail without the right to a fair trial etc. Most people will get away with a small fine, especially the first couple of times, and maybe someone'll take the time to explain the horrors of gas-chambers to them. They usually only really go after jail time for high-profile targets who are knowingly misinforming people and manipulating them into thinking that they've somehow been had in a gigantic zionist moneymaking scheme.  The law is there to prevent any kind of neo-nazi revival that goes beyond a select few.  You'll see neo-nazis marching in Austria and Germany, but they don't all get arrested for expressing their opinion either, and many of them would say the history of the holocaust is exaggerated.  

In the same way that comparing the holocaust to libel laws wasn't a good example - I freely admit this - comparing it to the creationist/evolution debate is equally misguided. Presumably, we'll be looking for a good analogy for a long time.  
 
I don't believe Creationism should be taught in schools either, and certainly not on some sort of misguided equal footing. It has no place outside of church, but thankfully most people here realise this.

I agree with you on France, I was answering because it was being compared to the Austrian / German situation, where we supposedly have ""one version of history"".  In fact, of course, historic sciences are flooded with texts about the holocaust in every higher education institution in the German-speaking world, comparing, analysing and arguing about the events before, during and after the holocaust.  Numbers, casualties, you can argue about everything as long as you don't deny that it happened and concerend several million civilians.

true,SnifflyWhale,null,null,"I recieved an e-mail today in response to my e-mail about ACTA from Lib Dem MEP Andrew Duff. It reads:
&gt;Thank you for contacting Andrew about the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement.

&gt;Andrew is not on the committee that specialises in these issues, but has been following developments closely along with his group colleagues, the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats in Europe (ALDE).

&gt;He recognises that some of ACTA's aims are valid, but also has real concerns that - as with so much legislation in this area - its implications for privacy and freedom may be more serious than is currently understood, and is seeking greater assurance on these points.

&gt;Throughout negotiations on ACTA the ALDE group has called for greater transparency and tabled a resolution in September 2010 asking the Commission for all relevant studies and impact assessments before signing the agreement. ALDE colleagues have sponsored many of the Parliamentary questions on this matter.

&gt;Negotiations were finalised in November 2010 and the relevant parties are now in the process of ratifying the Agreement through their internal procedures. In the EU this means that both the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers must give their approval. The Council adopted a decision on December 17th authorising the signature of ACTA, and the text now passes to the European Parliament for ratification. The International Trade Committee (INTA) and the Legal Affairs Committee (JURI) have already asked the Parliament's Legal Services for advice on the agreement, and then the INTA Committee will produce a report with input in the form of opinions from the Development Committee (DEVE), the Industry, Research and Energy Committee (ITRE) and the JURI Committee.

&gt;On 24 November 2010 the European Parliament adopted a Resolution in which we called on the Commission to confirm that ACTA's implementation will have no impact on fundamental rights and data protection. MEPs welcomed the Commission's confirmation that the ACTA provisions will be fully in line with EU law and that neither personal searches nor the so-called 'three strikes and out' procedure will be introduced. The Parliament also emphasised that any decision taken by the Commission as part of the ACTA Committee must not unilaterally change the agreement's content, and that therefore any proposed change must be approved by the Parliament and the Council.

&gt;ALDE will finalise its decision on whether to support the agreement or not once the legal advice and INTA committee report are available and only if concerns about interference with internet freedoms and other civil liberties can be assuaged.  Until then it is not possible to have a fully informed opinion.

&gt;In the meantime I attach a couple of interim briefing documents I have received on the issue, which are designed to address some of the specific criticisms that have been levelled at the legislation.

&gt;Thank you once again for contacting Andrew about this issue. I hope this response has been helpful.

As well as this I recieved a document entitled ""10 misunderstandings about ACTA"", which I'm not too pleased about, along with ""Why ACTA Matters"" with a bunch of pro-ACTA crap.

It's difficult enough between those two as it is. You want to make this a matter of 27? 

I do agree, though, that this way of making policy is not at all good for Europe. It's politically corrosive. It's *somewhat* acceptable now, because we're in a crisis and need to act quickly, but in the long term it's also extremely damaging to the perception of the EU within the wider public, and with good reason.

But criticism of this modus operandi, or the state of democracy on the EU level, is actually an argument in favor of a stronger and more influential EU, because it implies that members have to surrender more sovereignty to Brussels. If you want majority rule, you have to give up your veto rights, and transfer areas of policy towards the EU level so the parliament has the competence in the first place.

The areas in question, that are being negotiated by Merkozy, in essence are those of national budgets. The EU doesn't have a budget that would even come close to being able to finance bailouts of whole members.

But since your young, you'll find a job pretty easy, taxes are about 45/100 going to 55/100 fairly soon. The pay is pretty good, atleast better than German standards :)

About the weather, it's mostly cold here, during autumn, winter you can expect anything from -10 to 15 degrees and during spring summer anything from 10 to 35, but on average it's around 20 during this time(barely any 30+). It rains alot here too :)

Alot of topic changing hmm, I guess that if you wanna contribute to a system that will keep you alive if you fuck up in life, Belgium is your place :)

EDIT: people say studying here is mostly harder than in other countries, so if your education system is as fail as America's, you'll probably have a hard time here, only rumours thou.

if you are you are you are completely wrong. The introduction of high thc low cbd cannabis into lambeth (an area of london) which sees more cannabis consumed each year than the whole of the Netherlands, saw a massive increase in cases of psychosis. The cure for that is to stop smoking it and the psychosis goes away. Cannabis is also mentally addictive and a bastard to give up.

I have lots of experience of seeing people lose the plot on weed, and you can choose to believe that or otherwise. I was a smoker for many years and so were all my mates  many of whom were growers. 

Im not suggesting it isnt legalised just that it is done so in a way that protects those who do suffer. Any instance of mental health issues would see the license removed. I think that is a more intelligent system than just legalisation

Also, NPR is one of the best news sources in the States. It may have a liberal slant, but considering many of the alternatives... I support it. 

I don't remember if I ever went to a McCafé in France, but then again I tended to avoid the chains in general (except FNAC. God I love FNAC). The only times I ever went was when my French buddies wanted to go (which they did, from time to time).

true,gerusz,HUNG,Hungarian living in the Netherlands,"This is a multi-layered issue, but the basic reason is corporate greed.

There are networks of companies that are owned by the same company (T-Mobile, Vodafone and Telenor come to mind). They *could* provide cheap roaming and international calls. However there aren't a lot of people who use roaming / call international regularly. Four groups of people could be differentiated:

1. Those who don't roam a lot / at all, use other networks only on vacation thus spend 95% of their time on the home network. When they are on a foreign network, they try to minimize their cell phone usage. The companies *might* be able to acquire more profit if they lowered their roaming and data roaming prices, but it's uncertain.
2. Those who travel a lot to one specific country (middle-managers of multinational companies, people living on the borders, etc...). They usually have two cell phones or an unlocked phone and two SIM cards. Lowering the prices might actually *decrease* the revenue from these people as they would terminate one of the contracts.
3. Those who travel a lot. They either have a company phone or are just so rich that they can afford data roaming. As with the previous case, decreasing the prices would decrease the profit.
4. People who are living abroad or have a family / friends who live abroad (I'll probably join their ranks this fall). Skype was invented for them. I'll just convert my Hungarian contract (it's 3 years old, so no ETF) to a pre-paid one (to keep the number when I visit home), get a contract in the Netherlands and use Skype to make calls. I might even invest in a SkypeIn number / SkypeOut credits.

There's also the issue of different tarifs in countries with different socioeconomic variables. Unless every country has the same average wage, EU-wide tarifs don't make any sense.

I'd love to see EU-wide providers, but it won't happen unless the mobility of workforce increases (prompting a greater demand for cheap roaming and international calls).",0,1327502719,null,0,false,0,c3khkna,t3_ovvsc,t1_c3khkna,t3_ovvsc,null,1428237090,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

So let me clearly state, I am not anti-drugs, I would prefer we licensed absolutely everything, it has proven extremely harmful to ignore drug use and feeds capital into illegal activities. 

We cannot deny that for some people (regardless of predisposition or latent vulnerability) cannabis is harmful, therefore by implementing a system of renewable licenses and regularly reviews by medical experts is a safer and probably longer lasting route for legalisation than just legalising blindly, because there are mental health issues associated with cannabis use for a percentage of the population, and they do need protection, because without that it will become a media / political battleground and the result may well be a worse situation than we are at today, a situation that is not working, wastes police time and is massive waste of money and effort. A regular interface to a medical consultant could also achieve a higher throughput of problem users into addiction therapy.

You've rather made my point for me - the BoE does not ignore Scotland now, it's merely a minor concern compared to London and the South East's interests, but Scotland has no real control over these decisions. And after independence, I am quite sure the BoE will still take Scotland's interests into account when making decisions, and will still ignore them whenever they conflict with London's.
