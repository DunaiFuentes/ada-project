You have lower wages here in Finland? Well, go to Spain, you'll get paid even less. Then again, the local expenditure level in different countries tends to vary also. I know a lot of export businesses are really enjoying the low value of the Euro. Just like the US's been benefitting from it in their export for ages. The Euro is made badly? Yes it is, definitely. That's why we need to immediatelly fix the problem with the ECB's mandate and make us all responsible for each other's debts. We're spending all our hard earned cash on southern Europe's debts? Great finally we can do something worthwhile with our tax dollars since here we just use them to build more concert halls and sports stadiums, that no one'll even use. Maybe we can actually get southern Europe to the same sort of living standard as us And that might do something beneficial for their wages as well. Having free passage between the European countries is great? Yes it is unbelievably flippin' great. One of the greatest achievements in European history. Wouldn't change that thing for the world. Being a member of the EU allows Finland to do much more? My yes that's absolutely true. And instead of fucking that let's embrace it, because I want Europe instead of China to compete with the USA for the next mission to Mars. And I'd rather the EU stayed away from funding companies that make cellphone games in the first place. Maybe allocate the money to some fundamental science research instead. Y'know that thing that gives us all these derivatives we now use to play those Angry birds with. And oh my dear nature, we're getting an influx of undereducated workers. Well looks like we *finally* solved that problem of no one wanting to work low wage jobs in retirement homes taking care of that massive population of the elderly we're soon going to have. Open the floodgates, otherwise there'll be no one here who wants to clean up my office! Especially if they're black. We don't have enough of black people here.

Le agenzie interinali per loro natura non sono interessate alla formazione o alla crescita della persona: a loro interessa avere una persona pronta nell'immediato e per quanto riguarda il curriculum si controlla solo che le tre parole chiave chieste dal cliente (java, oracle ed eclipse ad esempio) ci siano scritte. Questo anche perché è difficile che le persone in ufficio abbiano competenze tecniche sufficienti a distinguere candidati validi da quelli meno preparati. Per le aziende piccole o grandi la formazione è un costo, ma è anche un buon indicatore: se spendo per formarti è perché voglio che tu nel tempo migliori e mi faccia rientrare della spesa : al contrario  se l'interesse è sfruttarti mandandoti da qualche cliente per poi sostituirti appena avessi qualche pretesa economica, non spendero una lira. la dimensione dell'azienda non garantisce da sola (la mia grande mi ha praticamente gettato nel lavoro, colleghi provenienti da realtà piu piccole hano fatto della formazione vera). Sulle tecnologie hai perfettamente ragione a dire che si imparano, ma quelle richieste sono fatte spesso perché non si è in grado di selezionare decentemente tramite colloqui. Si sostituisce la fatica di fare ai candidati piu colloqui, ben fatti, tecnici e non, con qualche parola a caso.

I depends if you think it is good that our financial system collapses, or not. I am personally certainly not defending it all the way, but I have a hard time seeing how we, at the moment, can live without banks or financial institutions. or a financial system. 

For example, a good reason to save banks is to avoid complete chaos and anarchy. If a majority of the banks fail/collapses, also a majority of the people loose their savings, their pensions etc. How are you going to get your salary and pay your bills? How are you going to withdraw money, money that you do not have etc. Think of how many times/month you interact with banks, in forms of transferring money, savings, paying bills, using your credit card, etc, and think you can not do that, nor do you have any money at all left. What are you going to buy food with? Can you imagine what will happen if that happened to the majority of the people in a country? The chaos?That is why we need financial institutions, we can not have a bartering economics, where I trade my pig for some shoes. If I turn it around, how do you imagine a European country will work without money? And the people in it? How are you going to pay? 

Anyway, that said, I do not agree with *how* the banks are being saved. 

My critisism is mainly what I said before, but to explain a bit more:

* You do not have to indiscrimently have to save *all* banks. If I remember correctly, in the first bailout there was 162 banks getting ""help"". One need to save banks vital to the system, not every single one. It is also a fair warning to other banks - look, this is what happens if you mess up. Of course, in that scenario it is very good if one have a minimum guarantee for the ordinary persons savings. Also, one has to be careful which bank you let fail. Remember the Lehman brother disaster - it cost a lot more to let them fail than to save them. 

* Second, the burden has rather indiscriminently been moved over to the taxpayers in (mainly I believe) in the Eurozone. While the money to save them have to come from somewhere (of course, tax payers) they should demand something back, mainly shares. This is good in several ways. First, the owners loose ownership, and influence (and money). In the future, they will avoid actions that might lead to that.  Second, when the banks are OK again, one receives dividends. Third, when the banks are OK, one can sell the shares and gain money. 

I am Swedish, and we had a pretty good bank save in the 90's if I may say so myself. You can read about it in Wikipedia, [Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_banking_rescue) and [Link](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/23/business/worldbusiness/23krona.html). 

* Third, it is important with transparency, swift action, decisiveness - because when the banks are in trouble, the market is shaky and one wants to regain the markets trust as quick as possible. Even if you *do* want to restructure and impose laws on the banks so that they behave better, it is hard to do it in a downward spiral. Nothing about this is transparenct, swift etc.

I saw your example of the Dutch bank save, but unfortunately this is not the case with the banks that is getting saved all over the Eurozone now. They are not getting to pay with collateral, unfortunately. ",0,1345138473,null,0,false,0,c5u5atc,t3_yba6r,t1_c5u5atc,t1_c5u4qhl,null,1429655737,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

Even the Old Town was completely rebuilt from historical records, pictures, paintings, and architectural records. A large part of Warsaw architecture is shitty Soviet era stuff, though it is being replaced en-masse with more attractive modern architecture. 

Lviv was *owned* by Austria-Hungary. That is very, very different from *being* Austro-Hungarian. All of it's architecture was built by Poles in a strictly Polish style. The same goes for Krakow. By the time Austria-Hungary annexed Southern Poland both cities had had hundreds of years of Polish architectural history. Not to mention that when Poland was partitioned, Prussia was the only one of the three partitioning powers who didn't install a relatively autonomous local Polish-run government. As a matter of fact, Austria had the most lenient and ""nice"" treatment of Poles of the three partitioning powers. Just because Poland ceased to exist as a political entity did not mean that the Polish people, as well as Polish culture, art, history, and architecture ceased to exist. Polish territory was still mostly run by local Poles, who spoke Polish and built buildings in the Polish style. The same thing happened in other regions that Austria, Germany, and Russia annexed. There was a lot of local autonomy in place, particularly if the region that was annexed had a long history of being an independent sovereign nation. Baltic architecture was minimally affected by pre-Soviet Russian occupation. The same goes for regions like the Caucus, Serbia, Croatia, and Northern Italy. Giant multi-ethnic and cultural empires like Austria-Hungary and the Tsarist Russian Empire had to let other cultures coexist and be given a level of autonomy within the empire. Russia was a bit worse at this than Austria-Hungary, and historically there are plenty of examples of it trying to stamp out local cultural identity, but it was never completely successful. Austria-Hungary practically always abided by a relatively compliant multi-cultural and ethnic policy, so long as politically and economically it's Austrian citizens held domain over the rest of the Empire. The biggest reason that Krakow has a slightly similar feel to cities like Prague and Vienna is because all three were historical capitals and the architecture in those cities encompasses lots of Palaces, and ""regal style"" architecture.

Approximately 30,000 performers altogether participate in the event.[1] Although usually folksongs and classical choir songs are sung, with emphasis on a cappella singing, recently modern popular songs have been incorporated into the repertoire.

While Iceland did have a parliament of sorts in medieval times, that was more like a gathering of aristocracy (with no king involved) than what we today consider democracy. Then for a long time Iceland was ruled by Norwegian and later Danish kings, from 1660-1845 it was an absolute monarchy. In contemporary times our democratic system in fact has very little history of accountability. One example of that can be seen in the fact that only three government ministers have ever resigned (rather than being sacked or the government falling), since the start of home rule in 1904.

So, nun zu den ""Rekrutierungsvorwürfen"". Produktionsfirmen haben mehrere Möglichkeiten, Kandidaten für ihre Formate zu finden:
1. Das Format ist bekannt und man kann sich als Zuschauer dafür bewerben. Der einfachste Weg. Leider kommen hier häufig Spaßanrufe. Aber, mit sowas muss man ja rechnen. Ab dem 20. Mal pro Tag rollt man aber schon mit den Augen. 
Nun zum interessanten Teil: das Format ist neu und es wird nicht von Senderseiten zu Bewerbungen aufgerufen. An so einem Format habe ich kürzlich gearbeitet. 
Möglichkeit 1. Castingagenturen / firmeneigene Castingdatenbanken: Für das Format vom Profil her geeignete Personen werden kontaktiert und ihnen wird das Format vorgeschlagen. Castingdatenbanken führen Laiendarsteller, Komparsen, Schauspieler etc. Hier ist am ehesten mit erfolreicher Suche zu rechnen, da diese Menschen ja fernsehaffin ist. Für ein Dokuformat Leute zu finden ist trotzdem nicht immer einfach, da es ja hier meistens ein Stück weit in die Privatsphäre (zb familie, zu Hause drehen) geht. 
2. Natürlich kann man auch versuchen über Foren, Facebookgruppen, Vereine, Sportgruppen, Hobbyvereine etc. versuchen, Kandidaten zu finden. Da fragt man dann freundlich nach, ob jemand jemanden kennt, der Interesse an einer derartigen Sendung haben könnte, und dann kann derjenige sich melden und mehr erfahren. Ist daran irgendetwas auszusetzen? Aus erfahrung kann ich aber sagen, dass diese Methode selten Erfolg hat - weil sich einfach keiner meldet.

Jedenfalls: Bei der Kandidatensuche werden den zuständigen Redakteuren keine Grenzen auferlegt. Freundlich sein, sich vorstellen, das Format vorschlagen und gucken wie die Reaktion am anderen Ende des Telefons ausfällt. Deswegen spricht aber keiner von unsachgemäßen Rekrutierungsmethoden. Manche Menschen, die mitmachen wollen, haben eben noch nie was von Castingdatenbanken gehört - und haben trotzdem mal Lust auf Fernsehen. Nein sagen kann man ja immer noch, wenn man mal einen Fernsehfuzzi an der Strippe hat :)

true,WalkerEU,CYPR,Cyprus,"Like I said before.. I am not disputing that austerity is causing a slowdown.. but no matter how you look at it, surpluses are better than deficits -- and that's the exact goal of austerity.

I think the word 'austerity' has somehow been tainted by the media.. all austerity actually means is ""don't spend more than you have"". A lot of the growth the world has had in the last few years leading up to the recession was fake growth fueled by borrowed money. The europeans have come to the conclusion that this is unsustainable. The americans will come to this realization in 2013 if their GDP growth is not as good as they thought it would be. Everyone has been dealing with debt as if it's unimportant because of the way that it's counted as a percentage of GDP... while GDP was growing nicely, this number could potentially just keep shrinking making the debt appear smaller (even if it continues growing in absolute numbers).

The US debt-to-gdp can balloon to Greece-like levels in no time if strong GDP growth isn't happening and you continue to deficit spend like crazy.. austerity will become a reality in the US too simply because there is no other option. The Fed cannot print its way out of this if the ECB doesn't go on a printing spree too, simply because the inflation they will create will not match the inflation in other countries, ultimately making the dollar worthless. This is one of the reasons why the existence of the euro is bad for the american economy. If the europeans insist on austerity instead of printing, the US will have no option but to go for austerity instead of printing as people will flock to the euro to keep the value of their money. Some nice reading for you.. look up ""fiscal cliff"" on google. If they fix the fiscal cliff, they will be downgraded for not dealing with their debt and deficit.. if they don't fix it, it's automatic austerity. The US will continue to push the europeans to print money instead of austerity simply because if the US starts printing too much money while another major currency doesn't, it's just going to make the US dollar unattractive to foreigners if they want to keep the value of their money.

Long story short.. the CONCEPT of austerity is actually quite good... in practice a few countries are having problems with it because they were addicted to fueling fake growth using debt (which is no longer possible as the markets have locked them out of ""cheap"" money). This very same scenario CAN happen to the US as well within the next couple of years if we continue with the same crappy numbers as now.. The capability of the fed to print money won't matter if all it will do is make the US Dollar weak compared to other major currencies (The only way this can work is if all major currencies print at the same time so the balance between them is kept, therefore hiding ""inflation"" in global terms.. so far it seems the Europeans aren't going to break from this.. so the US will have to follow austerity if they want to keep the dollar alive as an important currency with global value).",0,1345213478,null,0,1345214102,0,c5ukx4a,t3_ydies,t1_c5ukx4a,t1_c5ukrcd,null,1429663438,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Greece isn't a good example to study austerity measures and its effects or lack of it, seeing that the country has cooked the books, failed to implement any solid measures, etc.

Well, since we are talking about auterity in the countries in the Eurozone, I do think Greece should be a part of it. Sure, it is different, but so are all the countries in a way. Perhaps it is better if you say then that it does not work for Portugal, but might work for other countries.

&gt;So let's look at Portugal, the so-called «EZ's good and well-behaved student».

Is it, I thought that was Ireland, if we talk about countries that need a bailout. Otherwise, I'd guess Estonia. Not that Potugal is horrible in any way, didn't mean that.

&gt;In Portugal, spending is still reckless among public contracts. The current austerity-champion government has avoided this issue as much as it can. 

Isn't that the fault of the government in Portugal, not the fault of those wanting Portugal to implement austerity? Or, have they specifically said that they should not implement austerity in certain sectors. 

&gt;Meanwhile, taxes have increased beyond optimum rate, which has created a decrease in tax revenue; pensions are way below the minimum wage thanks to additional austerity measures; the list goes on

I don't know what an optimum rate is, but I think I've heard it is somewhere around 50 %, which we have in Scandinavia. I don't think Portugal is there yet, last time I looked Denmark was number one, and Sweden number two. Although, I guess you might be catching up. Isn't it also true that you pay less off the taxes you are supposed to pay (tax evasion) than the Scandinavians, so you still pay less? 

&gt;Like I said, spending on the wrong sectors and cuts on the other sectors isn't synonimouswith austerity no matter how big the cuts are and how much the government avoids dealing with the spending. It's not austerity, it's actually the contrary, it's a perpetuation of what has ben done until now, just on different sctors and under a different political approach - it's what th portuguese call 'despesismo', ie. 'spendingism'.

That is probably true,although I wonder why your government does that?  Is it corrupt, and if so, why? I have a hard time seeing it is the fault of the ones who lend you the money, it sounds like an inept government to me. 

While I understand that having your pensions/salaries lowered is very hard, I must admit that I am not to familiar with the Portugese salary situation before the crises. Were they raised in a fashion that didn't meet the output and the economic increase, like in Greece, or is everyone just super poorer now? 

In the end I just don't see how one can not implement austerity. Otherwise, one would need to give/lend more money to Portugal, than one already has, and that is not to popular either. Although, I can see very well that the government, which you point out, is implementing austerity in all the wrong places, but I can't understand why. In general, I have a very hard time, from a financial viewpoint understanding the Eurozone crises (not why, just why 90 % of the government behave the way they do).

We definitely need to change a few things in order to start healing the economy, but it's a very positive thing that money is actually being ""saved"" overall right now. If they keep this up for a little while longer without adding extra debt, our debts will start vanishing very soon.

The only way we're gonna manage to stimulate growth is by using the surpluses of the better off countries (via some sort of fiscal transfer). As it currently stands, the people of the countries with surpluses don't want to give up their 'extra money' because ""fu, it's ours.. we saved it.. you were lazy [or whatever]"". This is where the whole concept of a federation starts coming in. The graph here shows the eurozone current account balance as a whole.. we have some extra money to invest as ""the eurozone"" (10 billion euros per month is quite a lot of money).. it's just that we're fragmented and this extra money cannot be used where it's needed because ""Hey.. this is our money, save your own money!"".

Long story short.. if you want a quicker solution, push for a federal union. As it currently stands, the problem will eventually solve itself in each country if they stick to the austerity measures, but there is gonna be a lot of pain.

The germans.. finns.. etc, will not start giving their surpluses for stimulus in other countries unless they have guarantees that reforms will be made and the countries they help out will start running their own surpluses in the future.. they are not interested in subsidizing failed economies.

Furthermore comparing Portugal to scandinavia is utterly ridiculous - minimum wage in Portugal is around 600€, unemployment around 15% - and this is just the official number.

Well, how do you expect me to look at it? Apart from that I am a scientific person, it is completely unrealistic that we will look at it from a purely ""look at the poor Portugese grandmother"" point of view. I must also add, that while it might give a human face to what is happening, it doesn't solve anything, and perhaps one should also then look at ""why did the grandmother never ever vote for reform"". I do agree with you however that it should not be forgotten.

&gt;Furthermore comparing Portugal to scandinavia is utterly ridiculous - minimum wage in Portugal is around 600€, unemployment around 15% - and this is just the official number.

But, I must say, I have to compare Scandinavia to Portugal when one speaks about to high taxes. It is just normal, isn't it? I mean, when people complain about high taxes, who do you compare yourself with then? And, also, isn't it rather reasonable that you pay as much taxes as everyone else (like France, Belgium etc, at least? ) If you didn't do it before, maybe it is due to your government, or something. Also, why is the minimum wage lower - it can be interesting to answer those questions (who often have several answers btw). Maybe one of the reasons is that you have less tax income, perhaps (and more tax evasion), maybe one is that you lived under dictatorship for longer, etc,

&gt;Our government is incompetent and will do exclusively what the troika wants in order to look good. While this has cut down a little on spending it has diminished income drastically.

Why do you have an incompetent government? I mean this question in earnest, I really do. It seems to me that one of the many reason the southern economies are in trouble is that they have again and again put off reforms and tough deciscions and I wonder why that is. Why haven't people voted for candidates with sensible economic policies, I am sure that they exists, and I don't really understand why they are not elected.

true,WalkerEU,CYPR,Cyprus,"The cycle we seemed to be going through over the last few years was this:

We have x amount of debt due to be paid next year.. and we have a 5% deficit (so we need to borrow an extra 5%).. obviously we were low on cash, so if we don't re-borrow the money.. we don't have the cash that we need to repay the previous debt plus interest... so every year you ended up borrowing previous debt + interest + that extra 5% deficit you have.

As the interest rates start rising, the amount you have to pay becomes bigger.. The reason why 7% interest rates on bonds is significant is because on a 10-year bond at 7% interest.... by the time you pay back the debt with the interest, it becomes almost double.

We have been in this cycle for ages.. the whole point of the austerity is to make big cuts everywhere, get to the point of paying the debts due without having to borrow any money or at least not as much (especially if you are not running a deficit)... so on paper, this makes a lot of sense.. As debt is paid off without being replaced (and in ""southern europe""'s case, at higher interest rates), you end up paying less and less money every year on debt and interest, so you actually start having more money that you can use on social programs etc (as long as you keep it at a sustainable level).

For example.. right now the U.S. borrows money very cheaply in huge amounts, and they are doomed to keep re-borrowing to pay the previously borrowed money.. If they get some very bad economic news at some point and their borrowing costs rise, they will be completely screwed, because they will either continue the borrowing cycle and pay much higher interest and continue on this path until eventually they default, or they will go into austerity mode and start paying off their debt without replacing it with debt of higher interest rates. This is the exact thing that happened in Greece.. it all seemed ok while the interest rates were lower, but once they started going higher (and because they  were doomed to needing to borrow money in order to pay their previously borrowed money.. PLUS THE DEFICIT).. they got screwed..

Long story short, borrowing money to pay previous debt at ever-increasing levels is a big screwup... Imagine that 7% over 10 years becomes double the amount you borrowed.. you basically paid out 2x more money than you got the usage for.. money which could have funded the social programs that are being cut now... and the sweet thing about this is that all countries are vulnerable to this... as their debts rise or they run into problems... their borrowing costs will increase and this puts them into a death cycle leading to bankruptcy... I personally suspect the U.S. will find itself on this path early in 2013 as they have the fiscal cliff coming and they will have to increase their debt ceiling AGAIN. If the U.S. goes into a recession in 2013 and continues to have $1 trillion+ deficits.. with increasing interest rates, you would easily see their debt-to-gdp balloon to 130-140% (ie. make Italy look good) over the next few years.

But yes.. the whole point of this austerity is to start paying off the debt without replacing it with debt.. once we are no longer tied down to all these high interest payments, all that money that is going to ""rich investors""/banks etc right now can be used to fund the social programs without borrowing more money.",0,1345225442,null,0,1345227090,0,c5uo0j6,t3_ydies,t1_c5uo0j6,t1_c5unpqv,null,1429664896,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

High end restaurants will accept credit cards, but you should not eat at high end restaurants when you're in Barcelona.  I'd recommend using your PIN to get some money from an ATM and pay your food cash.

I didn't mean to be dissmissive, but perhpaps it comes through as that when one talk about it statistically. I can understand your point of view as well, but it is hard in an economic thread, to talk about individuals, and you can't base sensible decisions around it. 


&gt;Comparing tax rates is all right I guess, but you should look at income too - I don't know the difference but I expect it to be around a third of what you would receive in Norway or Sweden - add that to increased expenses to treat for your parents or your children, pay for medication, or prices which are not that much lower - diesel and benzine are the same price as in Holland for example.

Yes, we have a higher income, but also a higher tax rate, I am sorry to say, that we are also better at paying it (we start paying taxes at 2000€/year, so we do pay a lot of taxes actually). And, our prices, at food for example are among the highest in the EU. 


&gt; The problem in democracy is nobody knows best, and those who do have no voice. Dishonest politicians or incompetent ones it all comes down to a choice of nothing really.

But that is what fascinates me really (in lack of a better word). The southern Europeans I meet seem to be aware of the necessity to build up a competitive economy, pay their taxes, decrease government spendings, reasonable salaries, flexible labour market etc, yet, no one seems ever to vote for those things. I mean, why haven't Portugal built up a more competitive industry? They have been out of dictatorship since 1974, which is much less than Estonia, that is turning into quite the Baltic powerhouse. Or, why are they evading taxes to a much larger extent? I mean, the people I meet seem sensible, but nothing of it seems to transform into government. It can't just be dictatorship, that is true for Eastern Europe too, and some of them are doing great strives forward. I know you might not be able to answer me,  but it really puzzles (and frightens) me. 

Also, what do you want the troijka to do? I mean, any sort of change has to come from within, whether it's a person or a country, but of course the troijka could help - but how? Also, what need to change for you not to vote for incompetent people then, and start voting for people who make sensible decisions? I doubt that anything will change before you do, really.

I expect you have met mostly higher educated southern europeans. Awareness is really not the problem, at least not with that segment of the population, it is the politicians who are utter shit. I would vote for all those things, if there were someone to do them! Or someone at all whom I could trust!

Investments in tourism only happened in the algarve - which is probably the most boring part of Portugal - but should have happened all around the country (we have a huge historical and cultural heritage and many interesting things all over the country dating as far back as pre-historic times). Instead while Lisbon was the only city that grew really the rest of the country was left to their own - european funding in agriculture ended up as funding for Eucaliptus: an ugly fast growing tree that completely dries out the land of any minerals or water.

2) Will Montpellier be able to compete in Europe without Giroud? I wasn't impressed with their replacement transfers.  I think they improved overall, but they lack a central figure that can win them a game if they're in trouble. (note: keeping Belhanda will help though)

3) Can Marseille recover from an abomination of a season?

4) Paris in Europe, moreso than Ligue 1.  This is arguably the first time that Ligue 1 is in the European spotlight, will Paris justify that exposure?

5) The other Paris storyline I'm following will be team chemistry.  Home-grown talent has more or less been thrown aside for their transfers (although I'm surprised that Chantôme started in the first league game).

The problem is the cost of living compared to the salaries, since the Euro introduction the cost of living raise was huge, with especially multinationals charging the same price on products everywhere that uses Euro, Portuguese cost of living is 87% of the EU average, Germany cost of living is 102% of EU average yet, Germans gain 3 to 4 times has much.

&gt;I mean, why haven't Portugal built up a more competitive industry?

Portugal main industries were dismantled by the EU to not compete with France, Germany and Spain, on Agriculture and Fishing, the reason when this happened in the early 90's was that the EU should function has a whole and if countries like France already produced enough food products and Spain had a big fleet, we should move our effort elsewhere and not compete with them, so the country went from a net exporter of food it was in the 90's to a importer of food it is now, people were getting subsidies from the EU to not harvest their crops.

The other kind of industry the country had mainly focused in low paying jobs, mainly in textiles, suffered greatly from the globalization with factories closing left and right to move to Asia. 

Fot other industries to appear they need educated people, and this takes time. Education had a huge progress and is perhaps the biggest success of Portugal, but education only started to produce results in the 2000's with now coming the generations that have very good and skilled education, the problem is there is nothing for these people to do in the country, when there was money coming from the EU in early to mid 90's there was lack of skilled workforce to invest in new technologies so most money went to construction, now that there is skilled workforce there is no money to create anything so the huge investment made in education is leaving the country.

&gt;Also, what do you want the troijka to do?

To not destroy the economy of the country would be a start, we all know that the troika is not there to help and only to collect money, but sooner or later they need to realize that without generating wealth, there is no way any debt will be paid. This year targets are way of target and with a deep recession, a deep decrease of internal consumption, a skyrocketting unemployment, the government prepares itself to tax 100% of the christmas bonus for eveyrone so it can meet the deficit, how is this even a rational option? 

&gt; Also, what need to change for you not to vote for incompetent people then, and start voting for people who make sensible decisions

Easier said than done, people seemed to think they had voted for a sensible person but then 2 years after being elected he quit the job and left the country without any warning, it all happened in around a week and left the government suddently without a leader and everything in shambles. The result was a huge clusterfuck that was one of reasons for all this debt mess.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;The problem is the cost of living compared to the salaries, since the Euro introduction the cost of living raise was huge, with especially multinationals charging the same price on products everywhere that uses Euro, Portuguese cost of living is 87% of the EU average, Germany cost of living is 102% of EU average yet, Germans gain 3 to 4 times has much.

Yes, I can understand that. You still have a lower tax rate than Germany though, and I do believe, that you are not quite as good at paying taxes, if I may say so. I understand however that the prices have risen, but hasn't (or did at least) the salaries risen too? Is the problem the same as in Greece, where the salaries rose, but they didn't have the economics for it, or is it something else?


&gt;Portugal main industries were dismantled by the EU to not compete with France, Germany and Spain, on Agriculture and Fishing, the reason when this happened in the early 90's was that the EU should function has a whole and if countries like France already produced enough food products and Spain had a big fleet, we should move our effort elsewhere and not compete with them, so the country went from a net exporter of food it was in the 90's to a importer of food it is now, people were getting subsidies from the EU to not harvest their crops.

&gt;The other kind of industry the country had mainly focused in low paying jobs, mainly in textiles, suffered greatly from the globalization with factories closing left and right to move to Asia. 

The question still stands - why haven't you built up a more competitive industry :-). I mean, to rely on agriculture/fishing or anything similar in the 20th/21st century is not very reliable, to say the least. Also, I know our textile industry collapsed in the 70's, it was just a matter of time before yours did as well. I mean, all the countries in Europe have had factories move abroad due to cheap labour and found out that agriculture or fishing isn't as lucrative as before, but then you build up other industries. Perhaps I come across as to hard, but I genuinely do not understand why you haven't invested in technology or something similar, Portugal has been in the EU since the 80's I believe. England had a big fishing industry as well, not to mention Denmark and the Netherlands. I am just trying to understand, really, why.

&gt;o not destroy the economy of the country would be a start, we all know that the troika is not there to help and only to collect money, but sooner or later they need to realize that without generating wealth, there is no way any debt will be paid. This year targets are way of target and with a deep recession, a deep decrease of internal consumption, a skyrocketting unemployment, the government prepares itself to tax 100% of the christmas bonus for eveyrone so it can meet the deficit, how is this even a rational option? 

How are they destroying it? I don't mean to be rude, but are you saying that they should give/lend more money, while not expecting you  to cut back? I don't quite understand that from what you write. 

&gt;Easier said than done, people seemed to think they had voted for a sensible person but then 2 years after being elected he quit the job and left the country without any warning, it all happened in around a week and left the government suddently without a leader and everything in shambles. The result was a huge clusterfuck that was one of reasons for all this debt mess. 

Interesting. As I said before, I am really trying to understand why people in the south seem to vote for people who are criminals (Berlusconi), corrupt or inept. I mean, as I said, the people I meet seem to understand the need for taxes, tough reforms, investing in competitiveness etc,  but it seems like no one ever votes for that. How come? And please, it is not like our politicians are shining beacons, but when they say that we need to reform our pension system because it was to expensive and change the labour laws to become competitive, people thought about it and said (grudgingly perhaps) yes (oversimplified of course).

It's a perfectly sane idea to tax profits aggressively over some threshold where everybody's personal needs are more than met.

But the thing is, though, that state debt is only one component of the current debt crisis. It's not a huge problem that states have big debts — but it *is* a huge problems that their *citizens* have too much debt.

Now, when countless campaigns for gypsy education/labour training/healthcare have failed and many of them got to these western countries (btw, gypsies being travelers since centuries, by nature if I may), what does Western Europe do? Apparently the solution is to have them shipped back to the east. I guess that following the same principle, Central/Eastern Europe should have them shipped to India, right?

It is really sad what happened in Hungary, but I can relate to those people's exasperation towards most of the gypsies.

For example, there is the so called European Economic Area. This area includes the EU's 27 countries, **along** with the non-EU countries Norway, Lichtenstein and Iceland. Switzerland is not formally part of the EEA, but rather have a separate Switzerland-EU agreement that is similar. We aim to create this huge European Single Market where there's no restrictions on the movement of capital, services, goods or people, because we all benefit from it.

* If you're on a very tight budget, you should buy your food at Aldi or Lidl. These places are comparable to Walmart or Target, price-wise. For variety, I'd say it's mostly the same stuff (but often different brands/packaging). We have more (and arguably better) kinds of bread, and a higher produce-to-packaged food ratio. You won't be able to find certain US-specific items like Pop Tarts, Reese's and so on, but different (delicious) German specialties.

* Ikea really is that awesome. Very affordable, stylish and not rubbish quality. You'll find anything there.

* You'll have no problems with any websites, but be aware of the tyranny that is the GEMA. It blocks many youtube videos due to copyright reasons. But that can be avoided by downloading [Stealthy](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ieaebnkibonmpbhdaanjkmedikadnoje). Problem solved.

* I'm not sure which differences you are referring to, could you elaborate? What kind of program are you on and what is your major?

* I've never been to Bonn, but it's not a huge city and if it's anything like other German public transportation systems, you'll have no trouble getting where you need to go. For the first few times you use it, I'd recommend looking up the directions online and memorizing the stations where you need to change vehicles or get off.

* I'd recommend just being open-minded and friendly. If any questions about America/American stereotypes come up, just answer them truthfully. Don't trash-talk German/European culture or act as if the US are superior to Germany/Europe, that makes people dislike you. Don't be a racist/homophobe/general dick (that goes without saying).

* In Western Europe you're pretty much save. Really. If you want to travel Eastern Europe, you should be more cautious of pickpockets, but if you're being reasonable and responsible you should be fine.

* You probably wont get hit on as much as you get back home, which you will probably find quite pleasant. Flirting and dating are a bit different here. Guys are not as in-your-face as in the US, and generally a lot more shy. But once you get to talk to them and break the ice, they can be very (sometimes awkwardly) charming. Grinding and similar super-sexualized dancing isn't as common as in the US, even though it does happen. 

* Sometimes us Germans can be quite reserved in the beginning, it really depends on the situation and the kind of people you're dealing with. It doesn't mean they dislike you. Once they get to know you a bit, most people are really genuine and friendly. You might have to make the first step. Don't be shocked when people ask you all kinds of things about the US, American pop culture and so on - it's just interesting to us to hear an inside perspective. Be warned: Germans tend to be quite blunt, so don't get offended when someone is not completely PC.

Public transport is a breeze thanks to the semesterticket. You just walk on any bus, tram, u-bahn or regional train you want, often without even having to show the ticket. But the best thing is unlimited travel within the entire Nordrhein-Westfalen (regional trains only of cause).

The only thing I can say about the whole “being an American” thing, is that when I was there, there was a shit-load of American exchange students. I met and talked with a lot of them and only one was a complete asshole. I am still In contact with some of them and I consider many of them close friends.

My best advice is to join all the facebook groups that are created for or by the exchange program. Like it or not this is how you know the “when and where”, and also how you “meet” the other exchange students, at least in the beginning.
Also if you are ever invited to play Flunkyball (an outdoor drinking game) I can only urge you to go. There I never any pressure to play if you don’t want to and a lot of people come just to watch.

Just like most of us posting in r/europe have inherited a 1st world country, so what? Are we less because of that? Should we run and donate everything to those who weren't as lucky to be born in a 1st world nation as us?

&gt;But I am not going to go there.

Uh huh.

&gt;Nor am I going to mention the fact that their newly created wealth is not the ''a fruit of their labour'' but of days of toil from their workers.

Sure rich people don't work us much as people with less money, the point of working hard to get rich is to get to enjoy that easy life afterwards. As for those who where born rich, well, good for them!

&gt;What really strikes me is the fact that you are supporting a deeply unfair world out of ideology.

true,Vayl,null,null,"&gt;Yes, I can understand that. You still have a lower tax rate than Germany though, and I do believe, that you are not quite as good at paying taxes, if I may say so. I understand however that the prices have risen, but hasn't (or did at least) the salaries risen too? Is the problem the same as in Greece, where the salaries rose, but they didn't have the economics for it, or is it something else?

Portugal made some pretty big tax reforms int he last decade, so tax evasion is not a huge problem, it happens of course, but is not the major problem (it's the case of the right guy on the right job, a very interesting story really). Germany income tax max is 45% and VAT is 19%, Portugal is 46,5% and VAT is 23% so I would not say German taxes are higher (wikipedia for the german might not be compeltly accurate). Salaries rose but din't rose anything near the price increase, right now the salaries are at the same level they were in 2001.

&gt;The question still stands - why haven't you built up a more competitive industry :-). I mean, to rely on agriculture/fishing or anything similar in the 20th/21st century is not very reliable, to say the least.

Portugal has the 9th largest economic exclusive zone worldwide, it's a waste it's not used like it should be. And when we are talking of agriculture, we talk for example of Port wine, cork (where Portugal is biggest world producer, trees for paper (where Portugal is one if the biggest european paper producers) agriculture din't needs to be tomatos and potatos. The country should have used what it already  had and modernize it, instead of shutting it down.

The dictatorship ruined the country, especially the wars (yes plural, why fight only one war when you can fight several at the same time on complete separate countries!), when it was over the country was bankrupt and economically devastated. Then the revolution happened in the middle of the cold war and the country was not very stable until the mid 80's with a very real danger of becoming a communist country. The entrance  for the EU was a way get a definitive stabilization of the country. 

The fascist regimen had left the country without a educated workforce since education was only for the elites, so is not really smple or easy to invest in new technologies when more than half your country barely knows how to read. The money that come from the EU at that time was  sensibly invested on educaton and the creation of a public health system. The industry possible at the time was mostly construction that was what the workforce could do. 


The end result is a very sucessfull education reform that now is producing the result, education only has long term effects and there is a huge generational gap, the sub 40 people have education comparable to any other european country, but now there is no money to invest in the creation of industry so they either don't work or migrate.

&gt;How are they destroying it? I don't mean to be rude, but are you saying that they should give/lend more money, while not expecting you to cut back? I don't quite understand that from what you write.

The economy entered a recessive spiral, the deficit this year is way of target due to decrease revenue from taxes and increase expenses especially for unemployment beneficts (that rose 22%). 

Since the defict is not going to be met like this, the Government is preparing more austerity, in this case a 100% tax on christmas bonus, this will cause a even deeper recession a even lower consumption and even more unemployment.

If this year the target are already impossible, next year targets are even lower, no one know how it they are supposed to be met. So this is not only on Portugal interest, is stupid what is being done because it will be bad for everyone, like this there is no way the country will pay back anything.

&gt;Interesting. As I said before, I am really trying to understand why people in the south seem to vote for people who are criminals (Berlusconi), corrupt or inept.

Well, in this case the EU also likes inept people since the guy that left the country in this mess is José Manuel Barroso, the president of the comission, the one that din't a fuck about the people that elected him.

The problem is the parties are extremely corrupt so everything goes from there,  they were formed by idealist people after the revolution but hijacked by crooks when the EU money started to come, now they are this insipid things that have no politic left in them, you just vote for the guy that seems less corrupt and roll the dices, there's really no choice, the only parties with any political ideology in them are the PC and BE, but going communist or radical left are not really good options.

&gt;&gt; Given that jews are passionately hated wherever they go, would it be possible that they themselves somehow trigger such emotions by, say, their behaviour?

&gt; See how you sound like a nazi all along?

I don't. What separates gypsies from many other groups is that the hatered is not a deep-rooted cultural thing, especially considering that many troubled communities in the Western Europe had no previous history with gypsies at all, but something that across the Europe (literally, from Romania to Ireland, from Portugal to Finland) rises very suddenly with the arrival of their caravans.

Remarkably, the hatered, in my experience, is not against the people as whole, but against a certain antisocial subgroup that is associated with elevated levels of crime.

The hatered seems to be caused by their culture that results in low or non-existing education among the children, which in turn [forces them to a life of crime](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8226580.stm) and feeds the downward spiral.

Genauso stellt sich die Frage was die Konsequenzen daraus sind. Hier wird ein neuer theoretischer Fall geschaffen mit dem die Bundeswehr bisher nicht konfrontiert war. Wo liegen die Unterschiede zum ""gewöhnlichen"" V-Fall? Dieser ist geregelt. Es gibt Grenzen, es gibt Kombattanten und Nichtkombattanten. Wir haben ja seit Guantanamo gelernt, dass die Situation wohl doch nicht so klar ist. Sie ist aber in den Regelungen für den V-Fall eindeutig geregelt. Haben wir es jedoch mit Terrorismus zu tun, wie hier hören, kommen wahrscheinlich diese ""Ungesetzlichen Kombattanten"" ins Spiel. Diese sind nun aber tatsächlich ein Problem welches man ernst nehmen sollte. Jeder kann zu einem werden und er hat keine Möglichkeit auf irgendwelche Rechte zu pochen. Für solche Aufgaben würde sich die BW tatsächlich wahrscheinlich eher eignen als Polizisten die erzogen wurden im Rahmen von ordentlichen Gesetzen zu operieren und halbwegs selbstständig zu denken.

Die BW wird sich nun mit diesen Fragen und mit möglichen Szenarien auseinandersetzen müssen um sich darauf vorzubereiten. Wie sehen die aus? Darüber habe ich seit dem Beschluss noch nichts gelesen. Ich hoffe wir werden noch etwas davon hören.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Yo' 23 days later and I'm here to create the answer to the all important question: How is Switzerland shaped by her geography and so goddamned wealthy?

**Geography and Position**

Switzerland is defined by her mountains. The Alps are to the South, separating the land from Italy's river valley and hilly peninsula. The Jura mountains run across the top, effectively as a shield from the Northern European plain, upon which France, Austria, and Germany have played out historical rivalries. Neither of these are economic bases.


The true economic base of Switzerland is the Swiss plataeu. It is only 1/3 of the land area, but contains 5/8s of the population. The climate is temperate and continental. Westward winds bring it a good supply of water, in the form of melting ice on the mountains and rain. [The plataeu opens up to Germany and France.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/Trois_r%C3%A9gions_suisses_1.png)

The most important river system in Switzerland is the Aar, which is a tributary of the High Rhine- despite having a higher discharge of water then the High Rhine. [The Rhine is famous for going through both France and Germany.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Rhein-Karte.png).

**History As Affected by Geography**

Swiss history essentially begins like all European history- with the invasion of tribal lands by the Roman Empire. The Roman Empire was pushing against the north and the north was pushing back. Julius took over. Simply put: Roman power at the time trumped geography, simply because the Romans had a very good geopolitical situation at home.

Geographic forces began asserting themselves, however, soon after the Roman empire crumpled. Frankish kingdoms, centered around their own western rivers, began pushing into West of Switzerland, while German kingdoms in the north on the Rhine began influencing the north. [This is most clear in this map.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Alamannien_Hochburgund_ca_1000.png) where two historical kingdoms converged on the Swiss Plataeu. These kingdoms- or chiefdoms, depending on the time- were part of the progenitor French and German nations... but only bearly. They broke off, asserted independence, and played politics behind hills and mountains.

The centripedal force necessary to create the proto-Swiss state from these recursively divided culture-kingdoms, was supremely economic: free trade was required for the best use of limited natural resources- the rivers and roads. For example, states would raise a toll when you came to their part of the river. Of course, this was bullshit when you have a divided river that moves and swoops and sways. You need the costs to be less expensive- and boom, you have economic agreement.

The second was the growth of Austria as a power: before the Hapsburg dynasty, the Swiss had been content to do business under autonomous powers from the HRE, but the Hapsburgs began wanting more, and the proto-Swiss formed armies to prevent this. From a central nuclear in the center of the Plataeu, the [""Old Swiss Confederacy"" as we now call it expanded.
](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/Old_Swiss_Confederation.jpg/800px-Old_Swiss_Confederation.jpg).

The rest of history either falls in one or two categories:

1. The Swiss fighting themselves because of the French/German (Catholic/Protestant) divide. 

2. The Swiss defending themselves (sometimes failing). 

**Why is Swizterland so rich?**

Now that we have Swiss history and geography out of the way, we get to talk about money. Why is Switzerland so rich? The answer lies in the fact that it (1) didn't fight any major wars after Napoleon and (2) industrialized first. It built its first railroad in 1947, and by 1900 it had the highest GDP per capita in the worth, other then the UK and the USA.

Afterwards, all it had to do was make sure that it didn't lose its edge- and, of course, it didn't. It didn't fight in either World War, and was hence able to escape the loss of an entire generation. This meant that it had, comparatively, a huge pool of human capital to build, tear down and rebuild, while other nations wasted their young men's lives on the battlefield. They didn't evaporate 10% of their human capital.

**Geography and Neutrality**

So, we have the idea of neutrality established as the reason that Switzerland did well economically. Lets tie it in with geography: Switzerland, as I've said before, is a castle. Mountains to the north. Mountains to the south. Easily defendable hilly plateau. 

The second part comes from something that is strange: the centrifugal force of the Franco-German divide. Basically, here is a problem: If Switzerland begins leaning to the German side of a war, the French speakers get pissed. If Switzerland begins leaning to the French side in a war, the German speakers get pissed. They balance out.

**Conclusion**

Switzerland's geography affects its geography, history and demography by presenting it with contradictory geographic forces. All at once it is centripetal- the mountains say look to the valley, the river systems say look to each other- but it is also extremely centrifugal -the cultural giants have left thousand year cultural marks from the pre-nation day that pull the country simultaneously east and west. Strangely, these forces add together, instead of subtracting. They enforce neutrality. They also create the hyper-sensitive, hyper-democratic cantons, which create a feeling of ""Swiss""ness based from this belief in political idealism. In other words, there is a feedback loop of culture and demography with Switzerland's geography, which creates a more democratic and a more centralized state.

If I may draw connections to America, we see a similar strangeness. Two mountain ranges, two oceans, and a single, powerful river system create a political center while huge geographic differences and historical impulses create strong federalism. 



**tl;dr: Switzerland is wealthy because of its natural resources and central river system having created base of capital hundreds of years ago. This land-added wealth was never destroyed because the mountain range and other centripetal forces created a policy of neutrality. This is similar to America's geography, but smaller.**",0,1345258621,null,0,false,0,c5uw1vs,t3_x1wr8,t1_c5uw1vs,t1_c5iy9wp,null,1429668750,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2
