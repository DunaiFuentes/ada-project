true,krattr,null,null,"&gt; you can't help getting affected by all those news networks... unlike me"". On top of that, the very idea that the media favour Syriza in any way

I didn't say or imply anything of the above.

The right-wing media in Greece are a joke, the far-right media are as fringe as it gets, the centre-left and leftist media are way more influential. Add the usual TV suspects to the mix, and there you have it. It has nothing to do with my alleged delusions of grandeur. I just follow Parliament's activities and knew about this from the beginning. I also discussed it with several experts. In principle, there is nothing wrong with the question. Try to distance yourself from this a little, and you'll see that the media storm, which inevitably influenced many people, would not exist if an MP from another party was the one putting the question forward. I mentioned SYRIZA because they really struggle in their new role, and this leads to exaggerations, dragging along the media parasites trying to feed from the new kids on the block; PASOK is out of fashion now.

&gt; stand back and watch. We must do something about GD and prevent them from killing people or staging a coup d' etat. You can't just say ""it is what it is"" and look away...

Time for a short story. A while ago, I was reading opinions about Spinellis' project against corruption. Spinellis, one of the few people on a European level that *really* ""gets"" modern politics *and* technology, got it wrong this time. I do understand why he did it. He saw how things work from the inside, and thought it would be better to attack the system from outside. No, this will not work. A critical mass of outsiders won't change a single thing. If you find something wrong, anything at all, attack it institutionally. The tools are out there, but only a few people make use of them. Some prefer not to talk about it.

&gt; You proved one article was wrong.

Keep that in mind, because below...

&gt; finding a single shitty article and figuring out that they did it wrong ""mathematically"" proves there is no such thing as policemen-GD correlation. 

...you're replying to something that was not stated. Remember, the story was ""1 in 2 cops vote GD"".

The important thing is that this article was the ultimate source for 100% of the mentions about the matter. In English, everything started from blogspam quoting Vima, then it was reproduced in ""serious"" media, and in the end the story got a life of its own.

&gt; The police union representative has publicly admitted that a huge number of policemen vote and support Golden Dawn.

Policemen voted for GD, teachers voted for GD, priests voted for GD, transexuals voted for GD (P., one of the most famous ones posted this on Facebook; some GD members protected her friends when immigrants attacked them). If GD's percentage among policemen was the same as the national one, then thousands of policemen voted for them. But you mentioned something about this crazy little thing called logic. Let me see numbers. What, there aren't any? Of course there aren't any, because such data don't exist. Is hearsay ""logical""? I think not. [Read](http://www.ipathessaloniki.gr/index.php/2012-03-13-19-57-05/2012-03-13-20-04-36/2012-03-13-20-05-04/279-2012-07-02-11-35-37) the response from a police union.

Want to read something logical? More policemen voted for SYRIZA than anything else, because they were worried about new cuts to their salaries.

&gt; you are still waiting for ""official data""

It seems that ""logic"" is an adaptable concept, and data are not always required. :)

We see more people being engaged in recording/reporting violence. This leads to increased visibility. The total number of incidents might be smaller, the same, or higher. GD *always* did the same things, nothing has changed. The core members remain the same, everyone else voting for them did it as an act of protest (not condoning, just saying how people saw it). I'm waiting for the official data because I've seen many incidents similar to the one I've mentioned, in which the perpetrators were not known, but the ""racist"" tag was already given because... the victim was not a Greek. That kind of ""logic"" is not my cup of tea.

If you want to curse someone out, the main alternatives are:

* Shit on something they like. The main two are their [whore of a] mother (me cago en tu [puta] madre) and their dead relatives (me cago en tus muertos). Mind that ""me cago en"" is usually shortened to ""me cagon"" or even just ""cagon"". That's ""c**a**gon"", not ""cag**ó**n"".
* The good ol' ""son of a bitch"" (hijo de puta or hijoputa for short). This one is heavily dependant on intonation. ""¡Qué hijoputa!"" can be said to someone who just did something cunning or smart. ""¡Hijo de **PU**ta!"" is more for someone who kicked your dog.

true,emk2203,EURO,European Union,"Greece's exit from the Euro bears the risk of kindling a wildfire throughout Europe - possibly even on an international level - and may result in a worldwide economic crisis. Countries affected would include not only Southern member states and their EU partners, but also the USA, China and other emerging countries. This is the conclusion of an economic forecast study carried out by Prognos AG on behalf of the German Bertelsmann Stiftung. The study analyses the financial consequences of different exit scenarios covering a “Grexit” as well as a secession of different groups of crisis-stricken countries from the Euro. For the first time, the paper also calculates possible declines in growth for Germany as well as for 42 of the most important industrial and emerging countries until the year 2020 if one of its four scenarios should become reality. The authors of the study are seriously concerned by these findings.

For Greece, the exit scenario would imply national insolvency, a massive devaluation of the new Greek currency, unemployment, sharply declining domestic demand and many other problems. All these domestic effects would have a direct impact on its trading partners. In Greece alone, the ensuing losses of growth would amount to 164 billion euros or 14,300 euros per capita by the year 2020. The 42 top national economies in the world would have to absorb total losses amounting to 674 billion euros in total.

Since, however, a “Grexit” might seriously put at stake the Eurozone membership of other crisis-ridden countries in the EU’s South, the study also calculates the economic impact of three more far-reaching exit  scenarios. In the event of an additional EU secession of Portugal, for example, this would mean a loss of 225 billion euros for Germany by 2020 and necessary debt write-offs amounting to 99 billion euros. Globally accumulated losses in growth would add up to 2.4 trillion euros at this point, of which the USA would have to bear 365 and China 275 billion euros respectively. With this scenario, per capita losses in income in Germany would total 2,790 euros over eight years.

""In the current situation we have to make sure that  the crisis in Europe does not turn into a wildfire"", warns Aart De Geus, Chairman and CEO of the Bertelsmann Foundation's Executive Board. The market uncertainties resulting from a Greek or Portuguese exit would dramatically increase the risk premium to be paid by the already highly debt-burdened economies of Spain and Italy which could directly spur a further erosion of the Eurozone. Even if we only considered the domestic burden resulting for these countries from a Eurozone withdrawal, De Geus says, this would already reach the limits of what the EU is capable to bear as a community of solidarity.

The scenario would become much more threatening if an exit of Spain is taken into the equation. If Spain would join the group of countries leaving the Eurozone, declines in growth in Germany would increase to 850 billion euros by 2020, with outstanding debts of 266 billion euros being waived. In the USA, it would mean a loss of growth to the extent of 1.2 trillion euros and in the 42 countries under review it would result in losses of 7.9 trillion euros. The accumulated per capita losses would also soar up in this scenario. The result would be a loss of 10,500 euros per capita over eight years by 2020 for Germany, a loss of 3,700 euros in the USA and as much as 18,200 euros in France and 16,000 euros in Spain respectively.

In the worst case, the situation would totally run out of control if the Euro crisis were to reach the point where Italy would have to secede from the Eurozone, too: Germany would be giving up 1.7 trillion euros and would have to write off 455 billion euros. In this scenario economic losses in Germany with more than 21,000 euros per capita would be even higher than in the exiting countries: Greece would lose 15,000 euros per capita, Portugal and Italy nearly 17,000 euros and Spain 20,500 euros. Another effect would be a dramatic increase of unemployment: only in Germany the number of unemployed rise for more than a million by the year 2015.

This scenario would eventually lead to severe international recession and global economic crisis. By 2020, growth losses in the countries under review would reach a total of 17.2 trillion euros. In absolute terms, France would suffer from the highest losses at this point (2.9 trillion euros), followed by the USA (2.8 trillion euros), China (1.9 trillion euros) and Germany (1.7 trillion euros).

In their overall assessment, the authors of the study come to the conclusion that an isolated exit of Greece and an insolvency of this Eurozone country might well be something that the EU could cope with from a merely economic point of view. At the same time, however, it is extremely difficult to assess if and to what extent this might trigger a wave of further Eurozone exits in Europe’s South. If so, the implications for the global economy could be devastating. The deep recession which might result from a series of Eurozone secessions would not stop at the borders of the European Union but also heavily affect other economies.  Apart from these economic risks, particularly those countries leaving the Eurozone would be confronted with escalating social tensions and political instabilities. Therefore, the risk that a Grexit and an insolvency of the Greek government might turn into an economic, political and social conflagration spreading all over Europe and beyond is looming so large from the authors’ perspective that, according to them, the international community of states – not only the European ones – should take all efforts necessary to prevent this development.

About the study: The calculations are based on Prognos AG's econometric VIEW model, which is able to reproduce the national economies of 42 industrial and emerging economies on the basis of empirical data over an extensive period of time and in great detail. For comparison purposes, uniform exit assumptions or estimates were used to calculate the exit costs of the four countries Greece, Portugal, Spain and Italy. Thus, for all countries a 60 per cent haircut was assumed for private as well as public creditors and a 50 per cent devaluation of the newly introduced currencies in the exit countries compared to the euro.",0,1350465050,null,0,false,0,c6nppue,t3_11met0,t1_c6nppue,t3_11met0,null,1430169532,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

I am an in-house ERP guy. I am not even called a developer, as I do all sorts of other stuff, from strategy to training. As for the development part, people ask for shit, shit gets done in the test system, I test it a bit, maybe they do too, then it goes live. If shit breaks, I fix it. No sweat. We don't get overly paranoid about avoiding every possible kind of bug, as it is extremely rare that some bug would be so dire that I would not fix it in five minutes or at least offer a workaround. There no specifications, testers, automated testing or nothing. This sounds old-fashioned but there is literally no need for this as the cost would outweigh the benefit. It is useful to think in bugs as man-hours cost. If we cannot issue invoices for 1 hour, which never happened, globally it means -5 man-hours, as about 5 people do it in every subsidiary added up. (One guy manages 3-4 subsidiaries sometimes.) Well, that does not warrant investing hundreds of man-hours into preventing that by TDD or whatnot.

Now I know it sounds horrible to you, but this is what I am talking about. I would not be ""good people"" for you.

The difference is the intonation: you can say someone ""hijoputa"" in a friendly way (""you have a nice car, hijoputa"" or ""look at what the hijoputa is doing"") and this is totally accepted. Or you can say ""Rajoy es un hijo de puta"" seriously, which can be one of the worst insults, by the way. The same happens to ""cabrón"" and ""cabronazo"".
 Spanish insult with the attitude and the intonation, just stare at them with a serious face and say ""eres un hijo de la gran puta"" o ""me cago en la puta que te parió"" or if its someone old you can say ""me cago en la puta de tu hija"" or something abot their dead relatives, shitting on something always work: ""me cago en los cuernos de tu padre"", ""me cago en todos tus muertos"".

Political discourse itself is fine, but should never be in private and certainly never without an opposition present, the US and more recently the EU has a lot of ""Of course we weren't buying his vote in congress/parliament."" morally ambiguous bullshit, when the lives of 500million EU citizens can be irrevocably changed by a decision made without their *knowledge* let alone their consent, something is very, very wrong.

In the UK, the current conservative government has stated more than once ""lobbying will be the next big scandal."" whilst refusing to put in place legislation that will in any way control or hold the firms accountable, all the while privatising the NHS based off of lobbying by a firm they are now paying a large chunk of £250million to convince the British public it is in their best interest, the irony being double stamped in because of a conservative drive to ""remember the wars."" with the NHS being the main good think to come out of WW2.

Of course this is not realistic, but a team of super heroes defending earth against an army of aliens isn't realistic either. And it doesn't matter if they speak English or German to make it more or less believeable.
Also most (ofc not all) funny things a character says can be translated into a similar funny German thing. 

Edit: Sometimes dubbing even creates (unintended) puns in German.

But in some movies it is really important to have the original sound in my opinion. These are movies where the language is actually a more important part, for example Inglorious Basterds, Saving Private Ryan or Die Hard.

&gt;And you go on pretending you're not a fascist...

[According to wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism):

&gt;Fascism is a radical authoritarian nationalist political ideology. Fascists seek to unify their nation based on commitment to an organic national community where its individuals are united together as one people through national identity. The unity of the nation is to be based upon suprapersonal connections of ancestry and culture through a totalitarian state that seeks the mass mobilization of the national community through discipline, indoctrination, physical training, and eugenics. Fascism utilizes a vanguard party to initiate a revolution to organize the nation upon fascist principles. The fascist party and state is led by a supreme leader who exercises a dictatorship over the party, the government and other state institutions. Fascism views direct action including political violence and war, as a means to achieve national rejuvenation, spirit and vitality.

Yes, this fits me like a glove, in fact, I must be the perfect example of a radical authoritarian nationalist - I'm so fascist that I keep on arguing for more direct democracy, you have accused me in the past of dissing my fellow countrymen and I'm such a believer of violence that my political enemies cower in fear whenever I make mocking comments of them on reddit.

I guess it depends on the person, but I really don't agree with that. See, I took English for many years like most people Spaniards have. I think I started at age 7, but we didn't learn much so by age 14 I still could only speak in the present tense (no past, no future, no conditional, etc).

After that I started to learn by myself a bit more and by age 17 I could sorta say a few things, but I was by no means fluent in any way.

At age 17 I went to an international high school in Costa Rica, and half the people there didn't speak Spanish. I struggled quite a bit at first because I couldn't understand people when they were speaking at all. By age 18 I was already 90% socially and academically fluent. By the time I graduated (19) I was 100 fluent (except for understanding some accents). I've been studying in a top-20 US university since then.

[According to this](http://kalkulatorpolityczny.salon24.pl/399682,chlodna-reakcja-polskiej-opinii-publicznej-na-zwyciestwo-putina) 44% think that Poland-Russia relations are bad, 39% think that they are neutral. We have one of the most militarized regions (if not the most) in Europe just 300 km north from our capital. Russia constantly threatens Poland.

Germany is a completely other deal - it's far more civil country but there are influential people like Erika Steinbach who are a big problem for Poles. Revisionism does not exist in Poland (yeah, sure - we like to think about Great Poland but even nationalists usually don't consider it as an option), we just would like to feel like home in Wilno or Lwów (it's hard to get to Lwów because of insane border controls [yay for Schengen :/] but people are usually friendly, Lithuanians treat us like shit, when I was in Wilno only friendly people were native Poles and Russians). But we don't have idiots like Rudi Pawelka. And e.g. Landsmannschaft Schlesien – Nieder- und Oberschlesien e. V. has 200 000 members. And they vocalize that polish west territories should belong to Germany.

It's really sad that polish government abandoned ""polish Ostpolitik"". We should stick with others who have similar interests as we - Romania, Bulgaria, Baltics, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine (but that's another story).",0,1350545075,null,0,false,0,c6o7l5q,t3_11mre2,t1_c6o7l5q,t3_11mre2,null,1430178163,-1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-1

* Turkey

With that I agree - socialism is awesome in theory but in really it always goes sour, we're fooling ourselves if we think a government can do business better than a private enterprise.

Though I don't agree fully though, I still think the state should subsidize education and healthcare so that while these should be provided by a free market in equilibrium, everyone still would have access to these benefits regardless of their financial situation in their time of need. Some tell me this is promoting inefficiency (and heck, aren't some of our public schools inefficient!?) but I disagree with the overall scheme of things - as a society, the costs would be much higher because we really can't put a price on those things like healthcare and education.

&gt;Here: ""it was a socialist that's now living in Paris"" and here: ""If with this he means to go back to reckless spending like a good socialist""

Sorry, I meant that socialism was also the problem. Corruption also played a role in it, you're absolutely right.

&gt;Like every political ideology, socialism has virtues and flaws, but it's unfair to blame the socialism ideology for our problems when they were clearly caused by nothing more than corrupt persons that belong to parties that call themselves socialists or social democratic.

If there's something I disagree even more with socialism, it's what our politicians in these past decades have been doing. :x

&gt;Socialism is not to blame, every PM that we had since the carnation revolution (maybe excluding Sá Carneiro) is.

Socialism and government intervention in the economy is still a major part of the problem, this absurd debt and the deficits we had for years, you can't say ""oh, that was all corruption"" because it wasn't, some of it was actually simple populism, the typical ""spend more than you should to buy votes and let the guy who comes next clean up the fallout"".

Though, again, you're right, we also have the urgent need to make our justice system work - even we never spent more than we could afford and we had great incentives for investment in our country, it would be really hard to attract this investment if our justice system is at a standstill and disputes take years to solve.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I began referring to these parties as Nazis, when i realized that they don't give a fuck about immigration. They just hate muslims. All this talk about How much it costs, rape statistics, violence etc. tend to just be excuses to justify their bigotry.

One prime example was when a muslim immigrant woman in Sweden was to be deported after living here for 25 years. She had a job, had learned the language and had intergrated well. However, the racists in Sweden didn't care. They started shouting that the ""law is for everybody"", and that if they said she was to be deported, then she should. She wasn't white and christian/atheist, so she didn't belong here, according to them.

Also, when i talked to a right-winger girl this weekend, i pointed out that there are plenty of muslims who doesn't rape or oppress women, to which she replied that they are not ""Real muslims"", which is yet another example of trying to justify bigotry, by stating that those who aren't stereotpyes aren't ""real"".

They don't care about intergration. Only hatred for non-white. I don't like Islam, or the culture of the immigrants who come here. I want them to intergrate into our society and will not meet them in compromises. But i don't group them all together as rapists, nor do i blame their increased crime statistics solely on the fact that they are muslims. I also realize that our culture can be very confusing for them.

Social status, General racism, economic standars. All these are things to be accounted for. And Immigrants tend to end up at the bottom of all these 3 aswell. In the US, Blacks are extremely overrepresented in all crime statistics. But they are not muslims. Is it because they are black, or because perhaps that poor neighbourhoods/ghettos tend to be mainly Black people?

And that is why i don't vote for parties who thinks that the only cause for immigrants having higher crime rates is their religion. Parties who bring up statistics, but never bother to actually research any further on the actual casuation, and who thinks the only solution to the problems is to kick them out. I resemble these parties with Nazis, because they are rallying people against the muslims in the same way that Nazis rallied people against the Jews.

I don't vote on them, because i'm actually able to think rationally, and don't let emotions and anger judge how i treat others. 

Many peopel here seem to be under the impression that if you don't hate muslims, then you love them. If you try to argue against generalizations and bigotry, then you are a Muslim. They're wrong. I don't like Islam. I don't like the culture of many immigrants who come here. But i tolerate the fact that they are different from us. I don't tolerate them breaking our laws, but just like the law applies to us, it should apply to them. 

And that means that each individual should be judged for his own crimes. Muslims should not be sentenced based on the crimes of other muslims, just like christians shouldn't be sentenced for the crimes of other christians. And that is why i always argue back when people start circlejerking about how much muslims rape etc. Not because i like islam, but because i want them to be subject to the same laws, and privileges that we have.",0,1350555659,null,0,1350556429,0,c6o8lci,t3_11mw6m,t1_c6o8lci,t1_c6nvd8b,null,1430178636,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

I am in no way saying he is a liar, only that statistics can be used to manipulate data into supporting your arguement. Take his case for Switzland for instance - selling 450% more exports relative to their economy to Europe then we do, it certainly seems like a persausive case for not having to be in the EU.

However when one looks that that with a little more detail it loses creditability. For one Switzland is surrounded by EU countries, the UK has the open seas and ports. It is far easier - and far, far cheaper to export by sea rather then shipping over road and rail to a port. Moreover the 'Gravity Model of Trade' argues that countries export more to other countries who are close, or have larger economies. Well Switzland is next door to 3 of the worlds largest economies (and historically largest economies) so they naturally export huge amounts to them. Thirdly the Swiss speak French, German and Italian - is it any wonder they find it easier to export to France Germany and Italy!

Exporting to the Commonwealth is an idea commonly floated by those who wish to leave the EU - the questions is that why would they want a special relationship with Britian? Other then the Commonwealth games and aid the UK's relationship with many of the countries has witherd on the vine since we joined the EU - a full 40 years ago, a full generation of political leaders. 

Incidently his view that British leaders did not see why they were being out performed is not credible - there were numerous attempts to both consolidate industries to get scale and government investment in key industries.

1. 43.6% of our trade goes to the EU. He seems to think that somehow this is due to a technicality where our goods are exported through rotterdam. I somehow doubt it to be the case that the government and economists around the world have miscalculated on a mere technicality. 

2. His other argument is that western europe hasn't maintained 38% of world GDP. To me this argument is totally preposterous, the amount of growth required to keep at 38% GDP means we would probably at this point all have GDP per capitas far ahead of tiny oil nations like Qatar. It's pretty ridiculous that he assumed that somehow with growing developing nations western europe (not even the full EU) would be able to maintain 38% world GDP. he fails to mention the EU is the worlds biggest economy, and honestly that whole paragraph pretty much discredits him.

3. As a conservative in the UK he seems to be going straight for their party's main problem with the EU, that being human rights and laws which are actually good for the people but not for business. He goes on to say how Switzerland has bilateral agreements, without even mentioning the Guillotine Clause or the fact that Switzerland has no say when its signing up for all these agreements. Honestly, for someone who works in the fucking european parliament he doesn't have much of an idea of what's going on.

4. And finally he moves the argument in the direction of commonwealth, which I imagine is just a coverup for the fact that a lot of conservatives, probably including himself want the British Empire back.

Switzerland is a special case in many ways. But, for all practical purposes, they're a member of the Common Market in practically all regards. Not accepting the decisions that have been made in Brussels within those areas, without Swiss participation, would void *all* agreements and eject Switzerland from the Common Market (the ""Guillotine Clause"").  
But yes, Switzerland trades much more per capita than the UK. That's because they can hardly throw one of their products without it crossing a border. The author likes comparisons to the US -- their [exports per capita](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_exports_per_capita) are $3,375 compared to the UK's $5,780 (Switzerland: $22,230, a bit less than similarly sized Ireland).

Actually, not in this thread, a lot of other people have pointed out that they are not. Since you seem to be aware of the difference, but still choose to call Danskt Folkparti for Nazi, why? What do you call Lega Nord, Front National, the Belgian right wing party, Sannfinländarna, SD mm? 

I do not see why one willfully should use the incorrect term when they are others.

Just as with *any* term, I don't think you can find the perfect definition (after all, what is poor, or Socialgrupp 3 for example, or kriminiell?).

I would for example describe Danskt Folkparti as racist, nationalistic, populistic and to a certain degree, conservative, same as SD. I don't have *one* word for it, and I know that Islam isn't a race, but I doubt Danskt Folkparti are particularely endeared to Roma, Iraqi Christians or people from Africa (non Muslims) either. They simply do not like anyone who is to far away from their cultural ""sphere"". 

It might not be the perfect description, but I don't have just one word to describe MP, M, or S either really. OK, S I do, social democrats, but the other one, I'd have to use several. 

&gt;i find that Nazi is a much more accurate description, since we lack a proper word for someone who is persecuting a whole etnicity and religion based on bigotry. That's exactly what the Nazis did, so i find it similar enough to make that comparison.

Well, you are comparing wanting to throw people out of Denmark to genocide, that is way to strong for me. And, they are not persecuting the whole religion and ethnicity.  The Nazis had slave races, extermination camps, ghettos, public marking of certain ethnicities etc. I don't see anyone in DK being forced to wear a half moon on their clothes, certain ethnicities banned from professions, forced to prove your are not related to Jews/Muslim,  or that the next Birkenau is being built in Jylland. Are you saying Danskt Folkeparti would commit genocide if they can? 

That is the connections *I* and probably several others make when you call them Nazi, and that is why I protest. Call them racist and take an extra minute to explain what you mean instead.

If the Nazi party had gone to an election saying they would round up and gas 9 million people, nobody would have voted for them. However, by channeling anger and developing bigotry, they were able to get power, just like the right-wingers get their power now. By playing on the anger from the economic problems in Europe

While i'm sure there are some Right-wingers who wouldn't mind turning the middle east into a nuclear wasteland, in other words a genocide, most of the people voting for them seems to be using it simply to channel their anger, which is why Golden Dawn is on the rise in Greece.

As i said, i know there is a clear difference. But since i'm not ""allowed"" to use the term ""Racist"", as i used to, i have chosen to call them Nazis. Regardless, i know you are right here. I'm just trying to explain why i use the term Nazi instead of Racist.

I would ofcourse prefer to call them racists, but if you make a elaborate argument and happens to mention them being racists, they simply say ""Islam isn't a race"", and then ignores all the other points.

true,CDK2012,null,null,"You're not actually addressing the points he makes, or more appropriately why he makes them:

**A1.**   He's not denying that Europe is a major trade partner, nor is he advocating not trading with Europe, but the Rotterdam-Antwerp Effect (trade) is well known and observed, as is the Netherlands Distortion (income).  His point is that European trade does not actually represent the 43.6% figure.  European accounting works along first European port of call, so goods coming in and out of the UK outside the EU still gets counted as UK-EU trade if they first come into the EU via another port.  This is why the Netherlands appear to be a massive trading partner for the UK, a Goliath, even in European stakes. 

They're a trading partner alright, but nothing close to what the spreadsheets show.  In this way 43.6% is a gross exaggeration.   The Netherlands Distortion is even in the news now; Starbucks channeling its money through Luxembourg is an example of the Netherlands Distortion in only another place.  Income generated in the UK isn't classed as UK income.  Likewise with the Rotterdam-Antwerp Effect UK trade traveling from outside the EU counts as EU trade if it passes through the EU in transit.  That's how the Office of National Statistics and their European counterparts class it.  That's not to say Europe is the devil in disguise or to say that we should stop trading with Europe, it's to say future UK trade is trending towards outside the EU and that's where we should be looking to invest and build new trade relations.

---------------------

**A2.**  He's not condemning the EU for not maintaining its share of global GDP, he's arguing that the markets outside the EU are getting bigger but the UK is stuck having to go through EU trade commissioners to access it, and they can't always have UK interests at heart as they have to take a more ecumenical perspective in trade agreements.  Combine this with the UK having an atypical economy in the EU and he's saying that the UK isn't getting the best deal.

It's not that Europe is shrinking, it's that other countries, countries where we have our names at the door if we want in, are growing faster.

-----------------


**A3.**  When any country trades with the likes of America, or Canada, or Australia, or Japan, or Russia, or China, or India, or Brazil, they all have to meet up to each country's requirements and regulations without having a say in it.  The UK would still have to do this with Europe if it were to leave.  Even if Switzerland were to be part of the EU how much say would it have, and then they would be committed.  Outside the EU the UK would have to meet EU trading standards and regulations if it wanted to sell its products and work inside it.  Nothing really changes, and for that measure much of the regulation makes sense so there's nothing to stop the UK from doing it anyway.  In return however the UK would be able to make its own trade agreements outside the EU, it would regain control of its fishing stocks, and its WTO seat.  It would be able to fashion its agricultural subsidies in line with UK farms outside of the CAP which doesn't benefit UK farm holdings nearly as much as the continental model.  The UK has a very different farming model from the EU norm.

**A4.**  Tommyrot - this has nothing to do with empire.  The Commonwealth is very much relevant and the UK is excellently placed to capitalise on it.  It's certainly better placed to make more of it than an EU trade commissioner is.  Nor is it outdated.  Countries today still extend interest in joining; Japan, Algeria, Madagascar, Israel, Palestine for example.  Most of southern Africa is already there, as is India.  It's nothing to do with wanting the empire back, the Commonwealth acknowledges any member as being equal and not subordinate.  India being a Commonwealth state is not inviting the Empire back, they understand it is something else. The potential for economic growth, and to build political bridges and trade partners is huge, and one that is limited in scope if the UK has to go through a trade commissioner as the UK economy is not indicative of the rest of Europe, and as such cannot be properly represented.

If we were to go down a more Norwegian route through the EEA but one fashioned for the UK, which the author Hannan doesn't seem to advocate electing to talk more about the Swiss model, the UK could even have the best of both worlds.

Importantly the UK Independence movement is set to keep growing, possibly even breaking the glass ceiling in the following European elections, and it will continue to do so unless the arguments prominent advocates make, be they Conservative or UKIP, are addressed for what they are and not what people want them to be.

They are not;

1.  advocating stopping trade with Europe    
2.  trying to recapture an empire by talking about the Anglosphere and Commonwealth, and by them noting in this regard the UK has a golden ticket.    
3.  denigrating Europe by noting that its forward looking growth appears to be more and more outside the EU

true,back-in-black,UKGB,United Kingdom,"Well, to a certain degree I am playing Devils Advocate here, but your points have a few flaws..

&gt; 43.6% of our trade goes to the EU. He seems to think that somehow this is due to a technicality where our goods are exported through rotterdam. I somehow doubt it to be the case that the government and economists around the world have miscalculated on a mere technicality.

What was said was actually:

&gt; **The Treasury Pink Book**, the **OECD**, the **European Commission**: all now put the figure at below 50 per cent. The latest official figures, published by the **Office of National Statistics** on 11 September, show that the EU now accounts for 43.6 per cent of our exports, the lowest share since the current measure was introduced in 1988.

In other words, they are not *his* figures, they are figures from other sources, including the EU Commission.

On your second point:

&gt; His other argument is that western europe hasn't maintained 38% of world GDP.

That's not quite what he said. He pointed out that Europe's share of world GDP had drastically decreased, and is set to decrease further, down to 15% by 2020 and declining, and that other non-developing countries have managed much better than that. 

On your third point:

&gt; He goes on to say how Switzerland has bilateral agreements, without even mentioning the Guillotine Clause or the fact that Switzerland has no say when its signing up for all these agreements. 

I thought it was a fair comparison. Switzerland is outside the UK and has a similar dependence upon the financial sector. They've done pretty well outside the EU, and have no intention of joining anytime soon. No one seems to vilify them for being Eurosceptics. 

And finally:

&gt; And finally he moves the argument in the direction of commonwealth, which I imagine is just a coverup for the fact that a lot of conservatives, probably including himself want the British Empire back.

I don't think that's really an accurate observation. There is nothing wrong with wanting a closer relationship with nations with which we share a great deal of culture, and even extended family, that doesn't make you some kind of bonkers imperialist.

Human life cannot exist without water. It's a fundamental need and requirement, it's not a desire.

You can counter that and say human life cannot exist without food, and that is not a human right either.

However, **if** we have to choose between the two, or prioritise one over the other - then water is the first choice.

I don't know much about philosophy so if you could explain what a positive human right is to me then maybe I could frame my answer in a more satisfactory way and try to explain the derivation of the right as I see it.

true,CDK2012,null,null,"If they negotiate a trade agreement why would trade suffer?  EU countries aren't going to want to stop companies in their own economies trading with the UK and vice versa.  It wouldn't make a difference.  Even UKIP supports writing up a trade agreement before leaving.

&gt;They are using Rotterdam for a reason, because it gives them economy of scale.

They're using Rotterdam-Antwerp because it's a port hub.  They would continue using Rotterdam-Antwerp.  You're missing the point.  The point is that the ONS paints a different picture as to where all trade is coming from and going to, and that the growing UK markets when establishing direction are misrepresented.

&gt;Good luck signing an advantageous trade agreement with China for instance, outside EU. Their economy is 3 times bigger and growing fast.

We need good luck as it is because the UK economy is not typical of the EU economies.  We have no problem negotiating trade with China once the commissioners have got out of the way because they have what we want and they want what we have.  High end manufacturing, bespoke products, financials (world #1 with no EU country even coming close) and the service industry (which as a share of GDP has boomed in the UK which is not reflected as well elsewhere in Europe).  Trade agreements being tied up for months, even years, because the EU has to focus more on agriculture and textiles doesn't help at all.  India talks stalled with the EU over the textiles industry, and all they really wanted to do was to go into a room with the UK representatives and to strike a straightforward financial and services deal and sort out the EU problem in its own time.  Both countries were put in straight jackets, they had to wait until the small potatoes elsewhere were sorted before they could even talk.  The UK for their part could have given a damn where Europe and India were buying its carpets from.    

The idea that two economies need to be of similar size to strike a fair deal is specious.  They want to sell what they have and to buy what we've got.  That's what it comes down to.  That and the UK has some pretty unique USPs.
  
&gt;A3. You mistake regulations for trade agreements. Exporting cars for right hand driving is a regulation. Being able to export cars with no tariffs and being able to bid for contracts in any EU country is a trade agreement.

The third point was entirely about the Swiss having to accept EU laws and regulations; and the point remains that the majority of EU decisions the Swiss must adhere to if they want to trade, although they have separate trade agreements, is to meet EU regulations they didn't have a say in.  It's a pertinent point to say that wouldn't change outside the EU, or that the UK has relatively little say in it as it is and a say that is set to get a lot less when Lisbon voting comes in next year.

&gt;I already tackled the Empire question in my other post.

In it you said that it sounded like Empire because Hannan points out that the Commonwealth countries have resources but few means to exploit them and the UK has the means to use those resources through high end manufacturing.  That's not Empire or even close to it.  That's more like Date Harmony.

I'll repeat again; Japan, Israel and Palestine (on formal recognition) have all expressed interest in joining the Commonwealth.  None of those countries are interested in becoming part of a new British Empire.

true,CDK2012,null,null,"Just because it's called the Netherlands Distortion and the Rotterdam-Antwerp Effect doesn't mean it only happens in those places.  That's just where it is named after.  The same applies if trade outside the EU headed for the UK stops off at any other EU port along the way;  Greece, France, Spain, Poland.  A shipping company wants to offload in Greece and turn its ship back around back for Asia and let another company pick it up?  That's an EU port, my friend, so now we have to look at this percentage figure with even more incredulity.  It's no coincidence that the Med has several large hub ports, or why we're unloading in Holland in the first place.

The whole point is that the figure keeps getting rounded down once the flawed ONS approach is understood, but the true figures no one even knows.  Think about that.  We don't even know as a percentage where our trade is coming from only that the figure; not that anybody is arguing that we shouldn't trade with these countries and wouldn't continue, but when appraising where the growth is and the relevance to Europe we're not getting the real data.  

Similarly the Netherlands Distortion isn't just the Netherlands.  That serves to make the UK GDP look smaller than it should be with income generated in the UK being registered overseas; cue the reason Amazon, Facebook and Starbucks are in the press at the moment with regards to the UK - but it is by no means just the Netherlands.  Lower business rates in other EU countries and brass plate companies pop up despite their trade being in another EU country i.e. Amazon and Ireland.

&gt; if you want to remain a part of that, you'll have to accept the regulations that concern the Common Market as the fax from Brussels says, just as Norway does today.

Not only do I believe most of the regulations make sense, I'm also well aware that how Britain votes in European elections is also not indicative of how the rest of Europe tends to vote.  This in turn means what say Britain has in such matters is by and large irrelevant.  It is inaccurate however to say that Norway for example has no input and they are allowed to interpret regulations much as the rest of Europe does.  

Having said that this seems to be an argument of losing sovereignty.  I'd argue that if we put sovereignty on the scales with what is 'lost' and what is 'gained' both the Norwegian and Swiss models come out in front, and considerably so.  Own trade agreements, control of agriculture policy, fishing, seat on the WTO versus having to adopt EEA regulations which manufacturers would do anyway in their business models so they could sell to Europe, irrespective of the UK being in or out.  

That is not to say either that the UK leaving the EU would have to adopt either a Norwegian or a Swiss template, and couldn't negotiate a UK version.  Out of the 3 I'd argue the UK more so.

&gt;the EU would have the UK by its balls -- if you want free flow of capital for the City, and you most certainly do, you'll have to take the whole package.

Nonsense. The UK would still make contributions if it went down a more Norwegian model to cover bureaucratic costs, although if indicative once scaled up for the UK's comparable size it would still be a fraction of the current costs, but nobody would be holding anyone by the balls as no one would want to cut the other off.  It's guessing out of fear to say they would.

More over than that, you go and tell the UK regular Joes and Josephines that they have to take what the EU says because they have them by the balls and it's either whole package or not and you just see how people react.  They're hardly somebody we should be going further into partnership with, which is what Federalism means, if they're doing by exploitation and done the barrel of the trade gun.

No it's not.  You've just said that.  Little ol' Zurich is doing quite well outside of the EU at #5.  Little Singapore does quite well at #4.  Big, bad London doesn't have anything to fret.  Being a global financial centre clearly doesn't require a state to be in a large market of itself.  

&gt;Also US rankings are diluted because it has multiple financial centres.

And?  It remains London is the finance capital of the world.  It's hardly any consolation to business in New York if Chicago comes in 7th, now look at the size of the two, UK and US.  Now look where the other EU cities come in.   

It has nothing to do with the UK going further into Europe or not.  Finance is global, and much of it is done between large global financial hubs. 

You highlight **'people'** and **'market access'**.  Nobody is arguing a lack of market access.  Norway has the 4 Freedoms and isn't part of the EU.  The 4 Freedoms?  Capital, Goods, People, and Services.

If anything the UK would be able to improve London's standing, and other financial centers it has, by being outside the EU.  The UK if anything would have *more* control in this regard.  Remember, going into Europe further is likely to mean a Tobin tax which will if anything harm the UK financial dominance, cutting them out from the big boy club.

I agree with the need for a referendum but the economic argument only looks weak because rarely are the Anti-EU arguments properly addressed, only arguments framed by the pro-EU as those being anti-EU.

Re: Update.

That isn't remotely the same thing.  Quebec breaking away from Canada would have left Quebec with a lot of costs of independence to recoup, and that would mean hitting the financial district.  The UK is still sovereign.  A similar comparison would be Edinburgh's financial district if Scotland goes independent.  There are no huge extra costs to negotiating a trade agreement or membership of the EEA that aren't born out and dwarfed by cost of membership as it is.

true,specofdust,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt;However, if we have to choose between the two, or prioritise one over the other - then water is the first choice.

So essentially you're saying it should be a human right because you're choosing it to be that way? Or because people need water?

&gt;I don't know much about philosophy so if you could explain what a positive human right is to me then maybe I could frame my answer in a more satisfactory way and try to explain the derivation of the right as I see it.

Okey doke.

Negative rights are rights which involve others *not* being allowed to do stuff to you.

I have the right to not be murdered.

I have the right not to be falsely imprisoned.

I have the right not to be detained unlawfully.

These rights are negative rights. They don't involve anyone being forced to take actions on my behalf, they just force others not to take some actions which conflict with my rights.

Positive rights force others to do things for people.

So for example with your positive right to water, that forces others to provide water at their own expense for those who have or can not do it for themselves, because it gives them this ""right"" to have that thing.

Wikipedia puts it well: *""According to this view, positive rights permit or oblige action, whereas negative rights permit or oblige inaction.""*

So to contrast two versions of the same thing. I view the ""right to life"" as a right not to have life taken from you, where-as the positive view of a right to life would be that one has the right to have ones life maintained by others, others are obliged to feed, cloth, shelter you, etc.

Now I can derive negative rights from a simple deontological framework, but positive rights to me some oxymoronic almost, since they inevitably conflict with the rights of others. So you say that water is a human right and not only do I say ""Where does that right stem from, where is it to be found, how is it to be reasoned?"", but I also would claim that if I am by another's rights forced to provide them with water if they do not do so themselves, then my own rights are being impinged upon.

For that reason I'd reject the assessment that water is a human right. It is not my duty to keep others alive.",0,1350578112,null,0,false,0,c6ocqy0,t3_11myqs,t1_c6ocqy0,t1_c6oauu4,null,1430180593,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

There is no way to estimate p. These are regular polling stations, everybody votes there and there are no special lists. The only thing we know is that they are in schools close to Police's HQ. That's my beef with Vima's journalist: association by proximity.

Even if I drop my previous argument, I don't see how this could be the case. In the special polling stations, cops gave GD max 24%. In the regular polling stations, cops gave them min 35%.

Take a peek across the river once. There where the elite prepares/studies for life-, income- and societalaccounts and the heads smoke until they shut down or implode. Less than ten minutes away Pete Hoffman, Myke Doyle and Alex Heinz suck colored icecream from the bucket of life and underline the stuffy dignities of the near-by Harvard University with Guitarsoli and inciting 'no way back' punkrock.
“The Great Lakes Are One Of Our Nation´s Most Majestic Treasures” John F. Kennedy once finished his trail of thoughts in one sentence. Chance or principle, that the opening title of the debut is called „No Girlfriends“? Ten tracks with anger and direction, dangerously focussed on the two-and-a-half minute limit and almost neighbors of NO TRIGGER, with who one shares more than just the producer Jay Maas. At the GREAT LAKES USA it smokes(really no idea how to translate this, maybe rather 'sweats') soaking hardcore from „Let´s Face It, This Sucks“ whilst „Drink &amp; Stagger“ roars and dances from board(means something in between crisp and tough) and passion as if the trio from Massachusetts never worked on anything else but their aggressiveness/hawkishness before. Heinz pushes with his aggressive and engaging organ, reminds with „Ghosts“ once more of Tom Rheault and enterntains „Rambling Dudes Forever“ almost on his own with his guitar play. 
„Live Fast, Die Whenever“ therfore appears strikingly contrary and ballsy, only with „No Boyfriends“ GREAT LAKES USA take a step back so one can hear a trace of THE LOVED ONES. Such a break would've worked in the middle of the album just as well, as the clarifying titletrack shows.
If punk rock had a contemporary vein/stream, GREAT LAKES USA would go straight for the bullseye. „Live Fast, Die Whenever“ combines momentum and a smile, sounds more like a beer after a days work than college pretty boys and, inspite of its short stay, drills itself deep into the fists core. Mister Kennedy suspected it already:Does it take steady practice with this neon icecreme to cleanse yourself vomitting so down to earth(phew, this is almost untranslatable) like these men do it with their album premier? Fuck no. Might rather be the proximity to the Ivy-leage colleges.
