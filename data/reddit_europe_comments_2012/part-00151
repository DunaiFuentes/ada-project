&gt; Η ανάλυση των ψήφων που έλαβε η «Χρυσή Αυγή» σε 11 εκλογικά τμήματα της Α΄ Αθηνών είναι εντυπωσιακή. Σ΄αυτά ψηφίζουν - με βάση ειδικούς εκλογικούς καταλόγους- χιλιάδες αστυνομικοί που υπηρετούν στην Γενική Αστυνομική Διεύθυνση Αττικής και σε υπηρεσίες όπως η Άμεση Δράση, η ΔΙΑΣ, η Ασφάλεια Αττικής κι άλλες. Τα τμήματα αυτά- από το 806 ως και το 816 εκλογικό τμήμα-,βρίσκονται στα σχολικά συγκροτήματα στην οδό Αμπελακίων 24 και στην οδό Πανόρμου, κοντά στην έδρα του Μεγάρου της ΕΛ.ΑΣ, στη Λεωφόρο Αλεξάνδρας.

Q: What do we have here?

A: 11 polling stations.

Q: Who votes there?

A: Policemen.

Q: Only policemen?

A: Yes.

Q: Do they use special lists for policemen voters there?

A: Yes.

&gt; Είναι χαρακτηριστικό ότι λίγες εκατοντάδες μέτρα πιο κάτω σε εκλογικά τμήματα της οδού Τσόχα, όπου δεν ψηφίζουν οι αστυνομικοί, το ποσοστό της «Χρυσής Αυγής» πέφτει στο 12-14%. Αν συνυπολογισθεί ότι κατά μέσο όρο σε κάθε ένα από αυτά τα τμήματα, όπως προκύπτει εξάλλου και από τους εκλογικούς καταλόγους, ψηφίζουν περίπου 550-700 άτομα κι ο αριθμός των αστυνομικών που ψηφίζουν σ΄αυτά κυμαίνεται από 20% ως 30% επί του συνόλου των ψηφισάντων, τότε με την σχετική αναγωγή το ποσοστό των αστυνομικών που ψηφίζουν «Χρυσή Αυγή» κινείται μεταξύ του του 45% και του 59%.


Q: What do we have here?

A: Some other polling stations nearby.

Q: Are they the same as the 11 polling stations above?

A: No.

Q: Are they the same kind of polling stations like the 11 ones above?

A: No.

Q: Who votes there?

A: We know that they are regular polling stations, just like the ones found everywhere in Greece, open to everyone. We also know that regular polling stations, everywhere in Greece, use lists taken from the electoral roll, where policemen are also registered. In addition, we know that when policemen vote in regular polling stations, their names are removed from the special lists, used for the special polling stations, like the 11 ones above. The journalist says that ""where policemen do not vote"" when describing the polling stations, and then proceeds to state that ""the number (sic) of policemen voting there ranges from 20% to 30%"". 

Q: What is his conclusion?

A: Half of the police force voted for Golden Dawn.

Q: How did he get there?

A: Sorcery.

Edit: let's see some figures.

In order to put the final nail to this coffin, I've gathered all the data and now I know *exactly* what he did. It's another case of excessive rounding and serial pullingoutofhisassconclusination, in which many happily complied (and comply).

The ""1 in 2 cops vote GD"" conclusion comes after he ""examined"" data from polling stations in Tsocha street. There are only 7 polling stations there ([full xls list](http://www.ypes.gr/UserFiles/f0ff9297-f516-40ff-a70e-eca84e2ec9b9/TMHMATA_INTERNET_20120617_1002.xls), [imgur clip](http://i.imgur.com/2JdyH.png)).

Let's see how they voted, GD-wise, and if the case has some validity.

http://i.imgur.com/rT7mq.png

Columns 2 and 3 are where he got his ""550 to 700"" voters in these polling stations, and column 5 is where he got his ""20% to 30%"" of policemen voting there. Then he did his average rounding magic for 2 and 3, and for the percentages in column 5. Let's play along. Even in this scenario, and even if no other citizen voted for GD (out of the question), only 24-34% of policemen voters there could have voted for GD.

What if citizen voters in these polling stations gave GD their national average? Let's take the one with the largest GD percentage, No. 859. If the 548 voters registered in the electoral roll gave GD 7%, we'll have to subtract 38 votes from the 81 they got in the end. Policemen could then give GD the remaining 43 votes., therefore GD's percentage among them would be 17,84%.  That's 1 in 6(ish), not 1 in 2. As for the station with the smallest GD percentage there (No. 857), the same procedure would only let 1 out of 166 policemen vote for GD. That's 0,6%.

It seems that I was right in my earlier assumption that the largest percentage GD could get from policemen, in the worst case scenario, would be roughly double their national average. I understand that the title ""85% of policemen in a neighbourhood in Ampelokipi did not vote for Golden Dawn"" doesn't sell as well, but the ""1 in 2"" story should be shelved once and for all.

GroupA: Amiens I *think* kind of sucks. Lille less, and you're 1hr by train from a lot of european capitals. Creteil is practically Paris, only the rent is better. Nancy is a beautiful city and the whole region is rather good. Close to Paris/Strasbourg by train too (1h-1h30). Versailles again is practically Paris; more posh  than some parts of Paris and not much less expensive.

Group B: I know Nantes i super pretty (and touristic), the rest are more or less of the same level: medium size region capitals. Their wikipedia/wikitravel page should give you a decent idea. Tours is supposedly the home of the perfect/perfectly neutral french accent. 

Group C: Well Corse should have an accent, as well as Marseille. I can understand people from Toulouse or Bordeaux/Sud-Ouest better than people from Marseille (I'm not french). Outre-mer is not european France. It's the former colonies, I think. Most of these cities are really nice. I've been to most of them. Strasbourg has cold weather but you can live and/or shop in Germany (which is REALLY close) which is so much cheaper. The accent is OK. Grenoble is mostly known as a student town (and some mafia that you will probably never notice), I liked it a lot; much more than what people give it credit for.  Lyon is really beautiful, has its share of tourism, easy accent, OK prices. It's a big city, you won't get bored. Nice is the South. Less of an accent than Marseille, good weather.

Aix-Marseille, Nice, strong accent, and expensive cities (really good climate and really beautiful place), Nice is next to Cannes and Italy.

Strasbourg, strong accent, and a cool place.

Outre-mer, well, fucking strong accent, and sometimes, they don't even speak french ^^
I've lived few years in french Guyana, was cool, but a lot of drug traffic and criminality. Don't know the other Outre-mer very well.

Créteil : Don't go there.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Surely, there will be an increase in the number of people going to Europe to live there. I just said it won't be in the ""millions"". 

The reason is Turkey has changed quite a lot in the last decade. Europe is slow in registering and reacting to change, understandably. Just to give some perspective, the GDP per capita has tripled [1] , the growth rate of the economy in this period is second to China [2] and the GDP has doubled [3].

I admit that these are just ""dry"" numbers and may not indicate how many people will ""rush"" to Europe. 

But this means 10 years ago the same people who were thinking about how to buy enough food for that month for their kid, are now thinking about which movie to see or what book to read. And we already see the outcome of this in various metrics, from politics to how many books are being sold yearly. Think about the impact of this on the next generation. 

This was my experience when I had a trip recently to East Turkey. As an Istanbulite, I must admit, I was expecting what any other European would expect. Boy, was I wrong. People I met were not exactly elites, but working class and they were discussing who should get the Nobel Prize in Literature this year. They asked me questions about Stieg Larsson's book since I just had done a masters at KTH.

Looking from Europe it's easy to say ""We don't want them because they're ignorant muslims."" And that is exactly what makes Europe more and more irrelevant in the eyes of us. It sounds like Europe just doesn't get it, and is being deliberately bullying towards us where as it can be sympathetic and friendly.

They were fiercely proud of their city, food, culture. They were not looking to move to Istanbul nor Stockholm. This was the town of Gaziantep, an export city, near the Syrian border.

Assuming this trend will continue (and this is an assumption of course)
by 2023 less and less people would want to leave their nice and comfy jobs to go to Europe in a sea of uncertainty and face with Europeans who think lowly of Turks, often with a flavor of closet racism. 

That is my opinion and as all opinions it is prone to error. And yes, economics is important but there are many more areas that Turkey should improve on, such as larger freedoms of speech, better judicial system and so on. The fact is Turkey's natural position is to become like Germany or France, we're the inheritors of a world empire, we're used to build things, interact with cultures and maintain a decent life on this Earth.

We're aware of the problems, we're working on it. What we want from Europe is at least not be a hurdle on every possible way and better if it can help us going through this period of ""growing up"" as a Muslim democracy.

Often though, what I hear from Europeans and in this subreddit is ""Bah! who wants those dirty Turks here? "" I'm not even getting angry, it's sad. Like what Jesus said on the cross according to Christians: ""Forgive them father, for that they don't know."" (a little dramatic end:) )

This is just my very subjective opinion, since you asked (I live in Germany part time.) Long answer, do not read if others' impressions of your culture offend you. 

Germans can come across as extremely blunt, loud, and dominant. I have often experienced discussions with Germans whom I did not know (it usually changes drastically when you know someone personally) as very intimidating, almost bullying. 

It often feels like I am in some sort of dominance contest, and I have no clue why. An example: recently my girlfriend was parked in a shopping mall lot, and politely asked a normal looking lady who was standing behind her car, to please move a bit so she could pull out. The woman, with no provocation, snapped at my gf something like FUER SIE MACH ICH GAR NICHTS. 

Bam. No provocation (I was there). Wtf? This dort of thing happens a lot - and we have both been around the world a lot and consider ourselves pretty polite and culturally sensitive to others. I have many other such examples. 

Obviously this sort of experience tends to stay with you more than the very many extremely friendly interactions we have, but I see this sort of thing far more (not just with myself) in Germany than in notoriously blunt cultures like the Netherlands where I lived for a year or in a place with a rude reputation like Paris (4 years, people tended to be very civil). 

Also in Switzerland, where there are a LOT of German immigrants, including many very educated people, they are often seen as loud and dominant. Again, not always by very far, but there is a definite (and IMO at least partially deserved) reputation. 

I dunno if it is because German educational and work culture is just very fast paced and competitive, something I have heard from many German friends and experienced first hand in my projects. 

Obviously every culture can have its super negative sides (ask me about passive aggressive anal retentive Swiss). And of course others' experiences may be totally different, but it does weird me out very often.

* I would avoid Lille, Créteil and Amiens.  I've been to all three, but would not want to live there, particularly Créteil.  
 

**Group B: Besançon, Caen, Clermont-Ferrand, Limoges, Nantes, Orléans-Tours, Poitiers, Rennes and Rouen**.

* To be honest, there are few I would choose in this group.  I would not choose Caen, Orléans or Rouen.  

* If I had to choose I would suggest Poitiers (University city), Nantes (6th largest city in France), Besançon (large town sized place), then Limoges (which is smaller than Besançon).  

* Tours is actually an option, if you don't combine it with Orléans.  It gives you access to the Loire Valley and other bigger places, or university towns like Angers.  

* I have been to Clermont-Ferrand, but haven't spend enough time there to make a call on living there for a longer period.  

* I know Rennes very well, but would not recommend staying there long term.  (I much prefer Vannes in Brittany, though it will probably be too small for you).  

**Group C: Aix-Marseille, Bordeaux, Corse, Dijon, Grenoble, Lyon, Montpellier, Nice, Outre-mer, Paris, Strasbourg and Toulouse**.

* Apart from Paris and Strasbourg, here the main advantage is the weather.  

* In terms of size, you are looking at Lyon, Marseille and Nice, after Paris.  

* Again, apart from Paris, the further south you go, the more expensive it gets, depending on where you want to live.  Nice can be really overpriced.  

* Aix is small compared to other places, but it is lovely and lively with students.  I is close to Marseille, which is a sprawling city.  You have to do your research about Marseille.  It has a bit of a reputation, which some say is a bit outdated.  I've been there several times and quite enjoyed it.  It is like no other city in France.  

* Bordeaux is a big city and quite beautiful.  It does take a while to get anywhere from Bordeaux (if you travel by train).  

* Corse is a completely different story and you might run into language issues because of the Corsican language.  

* I would pass on Dijon (even though it is pretty), it might be too small for you.  

* Grenoble is at the foot of the French Alpes.  A university city, it has a charm, but I'm not sure if I would want to live there long term.  

* Lyon is a fantastic city.  I would strongly suggest you do research on Lyon.  

* Montpellier is another university city, but a bit on the small side.  

* I have mixed feelings about Nice.  It will definitely give you more of an urban feel and it a big enough city.  It also gives you access to some beautiful places along the Côte d'Azur.  

* I'm not familiar with the overseas departments and territories of France, except for Réunion, which is a beautiful island off the cost of Madagascar.  You are unlikely to get an urban experience here.  

* Strasbourg is probably big enough, so it is worth finding more info on it.  It's a pleasant (but bitterly cold in winter) place, but not one of my favorite places in France.  

* Toulouse is big city, with major industries around it.  You have access to beautiful villages and other places like Albi.  I'd rather opt for Toulouse than Strasbourg, but Strasbourg is better connected when it comes to public transport and of course, you are closer to other main cities.  

* Paris, well there isn't much to say about Paris really.  It's a beautiful city, with great atmosphere.  It has its dark side, like all cities, and some areas look a bit rough.  It can be very expensive, so you really have to look around.  I know the arrondissements quite well.  If you want big city, then Paris is your only option really.  

Note, in my experience (and at first I didn't believe it), the people in the south of France tend to be a bit friendlier.  Parisians have a bit of a reputation, because they believe Paris is France, much like Londoners believe London is the center of the universe.  

So having said all of that, I would personally choose one of the following:

1. Lyon

2. Paris / Versailles

3. Aix (if the emphasis is in Aix and not Marseille)


Out of interest, have you considered Nîmes or Avignon?

The EU have a lot of more important jobs than the CAP. Or are you saying that research, development, education is not important? 

&gt; The percent of the budget apportioned for CAP will naturally fall when the EU takes on more responsibilities.


So, instead of decreasing the subsidies and actually apply what we say that we are going to do - compete on a market, we will keep paying, and paying, and paying? WTO agrees with my stance - it is completely unreasonable to keep subsidising European farmers, forever.  

&gt;Asking if 44% of their budget is a reasonable amount for farm subsidies is missing the point. The real question is if ~0.44% of GDP is a reasonable amount for farm subsidies, or if farm subsidies should really be handled at the European level.

They say that because they have a powerful agricultural lobby, not because it is right or correct, because it isn't. 


We didn't subsidise half as much before we entered the EU, had stricter rules and were much more competitive - why is the EU refusing to foster competitivness, and why is France refusing to foster competitivness? Well, because that would decrease the subsidies and the farmers would not like it - means angry farmers in Paris.

Well, then, I have the *perfect* solution. Stop subsidising on a European level and decrease the budget with 44 %. Then the French can subsidise all they want - will not hear peep from me.

Il est évidemment habillé en short, tenue officielle des auto-stoppeurs, malgré le froid sibérien des derniers jours. Quelques difficultés d'élocution, des petites vannes *très* drôles. 

02:30 : Le coprésentateur présente sa toute première chanson, avec quand même beaucoup de difficulté. Et il ne sait pas tenir un micro.

03:50 : La chanson est enfin lancée, le coprésentateur commence à danser puis joue avec la caméra, puis se dandine façon malfreur, puis disparaît, ouf.

05:45 : Le coprésentateur... Euh, appelons le Gilbert, d'accord ? Gilbert réapparait et jongle avec une balle.

07:45 : Nouvelle apparition de Gilbert qui semble faire sa prière.

10:00 : Une dédicace ! Ca va être toutes les semaines, maintenant... Indice énigmatique : ""la femme à la bûche approuve""... [Une chanson de Janis Joplin...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkGUt4QYc08) Ca ne semble pas venir de la Rance, cette fois, peut-être que c'est la copine de Sylvain qui lui demande de faire passer ça et que c'est un message codé pour qu'on vienne à son secours...

11:15 : Le chat est venu à la soirée qui compte maintenant trois participants. Sylvain le montre à la caméra.

14:08 : Nan mais c'est quoi ce rire ? je comprends pourquoi Sylvain passe à chaque fois des séquences de Ricky Gervais, Gilbert a [le même rire que lui](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8C0Ou9WVTE&amp;t=0m16s).

18:03 : La caméra zoome... Est-ce le chat qui a marché dessus ? Est-ce Sylvain qui la pilote à distance et qui ne veut plus qu'on voit Gilbert à l'image pour qu'il ne lui vole plus la vedette ? Est-ce un crop ajouté par Sylvain en post prod pour les mêmes raisons ? Est-ce que la copine de Sylvain est séquestrée dans la pièce d'à côté ?

de 20:04 à 23:20 : Discussion philosophique et sémiologique surréaliste. Moments de blanc, aussi.

23:20 : Une blague de Toto pour faire retomber la pression. Nouveau zoom. La blague est évidemment une non-blague comme les affectionne Sylvain. Les commentaires sont... Pfff...

28:40 : ""Ca me rappelle l'odeur de pépé""..?

30:00 : On dézoome enfin pour voir à nouveau quelque chose...

30:30 : Gilbert prend la main sur le sacro-saint poste de contrôle de la soirée. Sylvain en profite pour parler au parly-marchy avec personne.

31:30 : Gilbert vient de se lancer dans une impro air guitare/air batterie, bref, un petit dandinement magnifique. Je passe sur les gros plans sur sa tête quand il se met devant la caméra.

34:20 : Gilbert parle anglais.

36:10 : Sylvain parle anglais.

39:47 : Gilbert se lance à nouveau dans [une petite danse...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0YhkGKtnQ0&amp;t=22m23s) 

41:40 : QLB ?? Gilbert fait son chaud et son show.

44:20 : Cadavre exquis lu par Gilbert.

45:20 : Enfin la fin.

Pour conclure, je pense n'avoir jamais vu une soirée libre aussi chiante, j'espère que les scénaristes abandonneront le personnage de Gilbert et qu'on ne le verra pas dans le prochain épisode. Je ne sais pas si c'est son short, ses petites danses ou le fait qu'il fasse tout pour voler la vedette au perso principal, mais il était insupportable.

Addendum : Quel mot Gilbert tente-t-il de montrer à la caméra ?

Why should the EU, who wants to be competitive, willfully remove an industry from this competitivness? 

Why don't they have to be competitive, at all?

Why should we go against the WTO, and harm African farmers?
