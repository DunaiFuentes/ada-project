One possible route that just came to my mind and that would be perfect as some sort of 'fairytale route': Frankfurt - Heidelberg - (Tübingen &amp; Burg Hohenzollern) - Black Forest - Zurich, Switzerland - Feldkirch, Austria - Füssen/Neuschwanstein - Munich - Nürnberg (famous Christmas market) - and then spend Christmas wherever you like. I checked the train services and they're fine. It's more of a ten day trip, though.

If you're not into mountains &amp; castles, but rather interested in diverse culture, 19th/20th-century history and nightlife, I'd indeed check out Germanys larger cities. Start in Frankfurt and go to the beautiful city of Dresden (4,5 hours via ICE). Then head to Berlin (2 hours from Dresden), include Potsdam, make your way to Hamburg (1,5 hours from Berlin via ICE) and go back to Frankfurt via Marburg and/or Cologne/Bonn. This trip will be a completely different experience though.

Additional tips: Frankfurt is relatively boring; wouldn't recommend staying there for more than one night. Oh, and since you mentioned renting a car: This is the only thing that would cause problems in terms of 'adjusting to snow/ice'. In case of snowy road conditions, problems could arise, especially if you've never driven in snowy/icy conditions. Add to that the difficulty of driving on the Autobahn (if you've never done it before, and in winter). I wouldn't really do it if I was you. That being said, the train network is fabulous and you will get almost everywhere, although it might take a bit longer than by car in some cases, particularly if you have to switch trains.",0,1353720372,null,0,1353778647,0,c75tw3w,t3_13ool4,t1_c75tw3w,t1_c75t0hl,null,1430483633,4,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,4

And they apparently know very little of what they're talking about.

First of all, not having one government has pretty much no impact whatsoever in Belgium. We have tons of them. If one isn't there, the other can still get shit done. No problemo.

Secondly, it was about a constitutional dispute, not a 'squabble'. Sure, perhaps it was a bit polarized, but they seem to ignore that there was an actual issue that was being fought over.

true,thompsonandthompson,null,null,"yes.

if youre talking about getting a PhD posting here it should be fine.

Firstly: I believe France is the only 100% self-sufficient agricultural country in the EU! Even if this is not true, France is a very agricultural country.

Secondly: beware the backward general public's view on GM products.
http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v30/n11/full/nbt1112-1018.html
this should put you up to speed. Personally I disagree with Monsanto, for instance, and I think each GMO needs to be assessed individually because there are some terrible ideas, but I've been surprised speaking to certain plant biologists who have faculty positions who buy into what is effectively green-peace psuedoscientific anti GM hype.

Thirdly: as a foreign student you will be at an advantage because they will be willing to waive some requirements. You will need to provide evidence of a masters equivalent. The masters here is one year of coursework and one year of research or thereabouts (maybe with less research in fact). I had a masters which was two years research which was fine.

Fourthly: look into cotutelle PhDs - if getting funding from the USA is easy for you, it cuts out about 99% of the difficulty, it also gives you an academic safeguard in case france turns out pants.

Fifthly: try, if you can, to organise a convention d'accueil, instead of a student visa. If you get one of these contracts you can get a scientific visa which is a LOT LOT LOT more simple than a student visa.

Sixthly: publications will put you in FANTASTIC stead here, most students don't have them before PhDs. To get funding you have to sit a concourse, its a competition and there aren't many places per year. But don't be worried, a lot of universities like to take on foreign students and especially anglophones, there is a push to increase awareness of the French education sector and taking on particularly anglophone student is positive for scientific labs in france (for a start it improves the level of english literacy in the laboratory, and you might be able to stick your name in the middle of a paper if you help edit it).

So if plant biology is your think I'd suggest montpellier, or toulouse. However - Aix Marseille is probably about to come into some big funding as it has merged three smaller universities into a megauniversity and now is, i believe, the biggest university in France. But that may take a few years to kick in.


Also be prepared to hear, just as you hear in every other country, how french academics are more hard done by than all other academics.

In reality in terms of research funding they are lucky as clovers here and they just don't know it. But on the other hand, they make next to nothing in terms of salary. (a post doc gets only about 400 euroes a month more than a PhD students).

Which makes it a more attractive place to live and do business. As usual with infrastructure projects, this subway will stay where it is for a very long time. Those are long term investments, not just short term work programs for the construction sector -- and the places where they pick up their lunch or from where they buy stuff with the money they earn.  
Granted, this is rather local. With other infrastructure projects, the benefits are more obvious. Better railway connections make it more efficient to ship goods between countries, and better roads and bridges make it more efficient for suppliers within countries to distribute parts to clients. It makes their economies more competitive, which leads to faster growth so they invest into our machines and can afford our products. This isn't a zero sum game and an economically better developed Europe is good for all of us.

&gt; Actually no, because the deficits of the South are the surpluses of the North.

That's a bit simplistic, the EU isn't a closed system. Germany and Finland even have small trade surpluses with China. Practically no other country without natural resources coming out of their asses (e.g., Australia) manages to do this.  
Anyway, as long as ""they"" have to borrow money from ""us"" to buy ""our"" stuff, or especially when the money comes out of EU funds, it doesn't really work out that way. Those Siemens trains use many materials and parts that have to be imported from outside the EU, and they require energy for construction. Also, the trains happen to be built by Hellenic Shipyards in Greece, and I'm sure that French construction company has hired local workers for the project.  
So, yeah, there would be a more immediate payoff if we spent the money at home. But it's not about the present, but about the decades and even centuries to come, and I'm convinced it will pay off in the long run. That is, right now we have a special situation where any money that keeps the Southern economies afloat in a constructive manner is good, which is why I really don't like the idea of EU budget cuts.",0,1353769620,null,0,false,0,c76173z,t3_13pnfh,t1_c76173z,t1_c760p5o,null,1430487289,12,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,12

true,simonask,DENK,Denmark,"&gt; When arguing with someone, just because you're on the internet doesn't mean you can throw decency out the window.

Well, I agree, but there's a meta-difference here: Serbians generally tend to take criticisms of their nation as personal insults to a much higher degree than other Europeans. Even French people are better at recognising the faults of their own country. And this is a huge problem given the history of Serbia, which anyone can see is pretty awful.

&gt; The only thing we'll ever agree on. Too bad most of my countrymen don't agree with me.

I think you'll find quite a great deal more than that, in the end, but no matter. :)

&gt; Are you kidding me? Just because they might not be talking about Serbia right this minute doesn't mean we haven't been made out to be the bad guy. All. The. Time.

Well, in the 90s this was true. And you really have to realise that *you were the bad guys*. Not throughout history, and not you personally (I hope), and not because Serbians weren't also the target of horrible actions, but because Serbian nationalists, who wanted Serbian rule over what is now Croatia, Bosnia, and Slovenia *started a war*, and killed thousands.

&gt; I noticed you said you've traveled to the Balkan region. Neat. Where did you go? I'm sorry that some people gave you a bad impression, but let me assure you that those people are indeed the minority. Every country has their share of right-wing nutjobs and Serbia is no different.

I spent most of my time in the wonderful cities of Zagreb and Belgrade. I had a wonderful time, although coming from Zagreb to Belgrade was pretty disheartening — Croatia seems to be doing so incredibly, massively better than Serbia, and the atmosphere is so different between the two cities that would otherwise be very comparable (extremely similar culture, language, food, climate, etc.). Both countries have big problems with corruption, but in Serbia it seems a lot more overt and shameless. Everyone seems to be having a harder time, scrambling to get by under very harsh circumstances. That was my experience anyway.

Serbia has a few more crazy right-wing nutjobs than its size warrants, and of course this is no surprise given 1) poverty and 2) history.

There is a ""The House"" chapter covering the differences between how French and American deal with guests at their respective houses.

I don't recall such a behavior is described in the book. There's an example of a French girl renting a room in a good American cook's house, and she's not invited at the dinner table.

However, your situation (American not invited at the table) is not described in the book. As a French guy, this shocks me too. So I would not put this situation on a cultural level.

I think your roommates consider you as ""just a roommate"", not a friend, and don't invite/allow you at the dinner table. 

How are your relations with your roommates? Do you go out together, do any activities together? Or do you just bump into each other at home?

For the record, as a French, I find it extremely rude and very bad mannered. I would never do that, and I don't know anyone, family, friends, who would do that. It even makes me angry. They sort of put a barrier, instead of welcoming you to their activities.

true,Amaturus,,Expat,"* Every ATM I've used in Germany and Switzerland could read my bank card. The problem comes more in stores. Some retailers can process credit cards, but some---like PennyMarkt for instance---will only take EC card or cash. The more important thing is to notify your bank and credit card companies that you're going overseas before you leave so the card isn't marked for fraud. Your American bank probably has a minimum amount of euros you can order without a major fee, so if it's 200 or so, go ahead and convert it so you have that in your wallet. German banks like wire transfers, so you'll need to get accustomed to filling out wire transfer slips if you're staying for a longer time. If you choose a bank near a university, they likely have experience with international students and will be helpful.

* There are still internet shops, usually in train stations that will charge maybe €10 for 30 minutes. It's probably cheaper than that. Many hostels will have some computers too, but they tend to be crappy.

&gt;Denials of the massacre by public officials in Japan
In May 1994, Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano called the Nanjing Massacre a ""fabrication"".[96]

&gt;On June 19, 2007, a group of around 100 Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) lawmakers again denounced the Nanjing Massacre as a fabrication, arguing that there was no evidence to prove the allegations of mass killings by Japanese soldiers. They accused Beijing of using the alleged incident as a ""political advertisement"".[97] [98]

&gt;On February 20, 2012, Takashi Kawamura, mayor of Nagoya, told a visiting delegation from Nanjing that the massacre ""probably never happened"". Two days later he defended his remarks, saying, ""Even since I was a national Diet representative, I have said [repeatedly] there was no [Nanjing] massacre that resulted in murders of several hundred thousands of people.""[99][100]

&gt;On February 24, 2012, Tokyo governor Shintaro Ishihara said that he also believes that the Nanjing massacre never happened. He reportedly claims it would have been impossible to kill so many people in such a short period of time.[101]

Do yourself a big favor and apply for a Schwab bank account in the U.S. and link it to whatever your normal account is. All ATM fees, transaction fees, foreign conversion fees that you get when withdrawing money from an ATM (all of them will take your regular Schwab card) will be refunded to you in full at the end of each month. Also there's no minimum withdrawal amount. Only if you are planning on living/working in Germany should you worry about a German bank account. 

Get a JP Morgan Select Visa Credit card. It is the only card I know of that Americans can easily get that has the chip all of Europe uses. Some places might take your regular card but really this is the way to go. Cash is king though. 

Rather than relying entirely on internet cafes I would buy a used Ipod touch 2g on craigslist for $50 to use its wifi capabilities whenever near a free or low cost wifi signal. Gives you more freedom and cheaper than paying to use a computer in the long run. 

I know there's the stadtbahn for public transport inside the city, hadn't used much else. It is extremely important that once you buy a ticket to immediately get it stamped upon entering the train to validate it.

Most everywhere only accepts cash, so the ATM access is most important. i'd recommend pulling out a good amount right at the airport. also, let your bank know you'll be traveling. the only setback i had as a result of not having a bank card with a chip in it was while trying to use cigarette machines, which verify your age. 

internet at hotels is hit or miss. oftentimes you'll have to ask for an internet ticket, which will allow you a certain amount (usually 24hrs) for free. some will charge you 10 euros an hour. a few will just give you the wifi password. 

public transportation took me a couple days to get used to. there are travel zones, A,B,C,D, etc. which depend on how far you're travelling. 'A' will get you anywhere in the city proper, B for the outskirts and suburban areas outside, and i think a K option for very short travel (2 or 3 stops i think). this might be too much detail a few months in advance, heh. the ticket machines at the train stations all have english options. 1-3 euros will get you anywhere in the city.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; Actually yes, because French construction companies got paid hundreds of millions for it, and German companies like Siemens continue to provide the trains. Also, when you go to Athens you are no longer required to wait for buses or pay expensive taxi rides. So it's a win-win situation for all of us.

In a construction project most of the costs come from materials, and those materials are in finite supply. You can't use the same cement that was used in Athens metro to build a new metro line Helsinki.

&gt; Actually no, because the deficits of the South are the surpluses of the North. The surpluses of the North have the result of Finland and other countries borrowing cheaper on the markets. I was in the minority when I discussed this with other Germans some time ago, but now many of them understand this aspect of the crisis.

The reason Finland has trade and balance of payments surplus is thanks to its export industries that are able compete globally. Currently approx 50% of Finnish exports go outside the EU, 30% to Eurozone, and 20% to other EU countries. Like said before in this thread, the only countries with balance of trade with China are Finland and Germany.

The reason why southern countries have had balance of payments and trade deficits is because they don't export enough. And that isn't fixed by increasing wages in the North to able to buy more olive oil or luxury leather hand bags, it is fixed by creating new exports to new destinations such as China, East-Asia, Middle-East, India, Latin America, etc...

&gt; Juncker is right, many people are so ignorant and selfish that they won't admit the obvious.

Let takes another view. In Finland thanks to our choice to have a competitive economy and due to unfavourable natural environment, we have a suicide rate of 17.3 per 100000 inhabitants.

I am not sure what you see as minor. [Here](http://www.consilium.europa.eu/eeas/security-defence/eu-operations.aspx?lang=en) is an overview over past and current operations under the CSDP framework. Admittedly, these are all no major land wars (that's not the point of CSDP anyway), but I would not necessarily call it minor. Compared to NATO smaller, yes. 

&gt; unless the US stops backing NATO as they are obviously the driving force behind it.

There are also European countries that favour the NATO over the further development of the CFSP/CSDP. Notably the UK who still sees its defence and security future in the transatlantic alliance whereas France is the usual counter-example that would prefer more independence from the American-led NATO. The rest of the EU member states is probably to be found somewhere in between - Germany has traditionally tried to mediate between those two positions. 

Edit. In addition I do not necessarily see the CFSP/CSDP structures and institutions as opposed to the NATO. This is also the ""official"" position concerning the two frameworks: separate but not separable. NATO has quite an astonishing track record of cooperation and integration between very different armed forces and I would see it as a strategic mistake to just dismantle it.

Misses a key point.

Amidst all these babbling and maybe contradictory multiple global identities it is not easy to find a way to run a governable system where people have enough in common to make shared rules work. What if one of the 'identities among many' has a strong streak of intolerance?

The 'nation' is one way to deal with that: people agree a shared identity as the basis for political legitimacy.

Look at how many smaller countries are right at the top of world rankings of honesty and competitiveness. That's surely because they have an internal 'solidarity' or team spirit that allows social trust to work in a very different way - not every symbol or value is up for grabs, as it appears to be in the UK and even increasingly in the USA.

See also the EU's current pains. Surely also a deep legitimacy crisis - increasingly difficult to set rules that command respect across the EU space?

The UK has moved to some post-modern idea of multi-culturalism but is now struggling to devise and uphold rules that work for anyone and anything. That UKIP/adoption fiasco in Rotherham is a classic example of the state utterly failing to cope with multiple competing identities as praised above and so slumping into oppression.""

true,Jedibeeftrix,null,null,"Ah, the idiocy of transnational progressivism rears its head:

""The emotional choice now isn’t between nation and Europe. Rather, people are gradually replacing nationalism with an array of transnational loyalties.""

Not that there is anything wrong with an individual having multiple identities, nor too their national identity as a relatively unimportant one.

No, where the idiocy arrives in creating an ideology to foisted on people (plural) regardless of whether they want a new identity or not.

The crucial feature of indirect democracy is the perception of representation, the collective trust in shared aims and expectations that allows the people to put their destiny in the hands of another, safe in the knowledge that even if ‘their’ man doesn’t get the job then the other guy will still be looking after their best interests.

The manner in which this trust is built is the knowledge that you and ‘he’ have a history of cooperation, and that your respective families likewise have a shared social and cultural history of cooperation, all of which allows you to trust that when adversity strikes ‘he’ will act in a predictable and acceptable way.

There are many varieties of trust networks including religion and ideology, but we neither live in an authoritarian theocracy or a communist dictatorship, and thus the most relevant network of trust in western europe is the sovereign nation state, as it can make the most binding claim to a common identity that gives birth to a trustful Demos.

There is obvious truth in this, witness the passionate defence of laïcité by the French, or the determined neutrality espoused by the Irish, the rejection of abortion by the Polish, the dogged euro-scepticism of the British, or the accommodation of Moscow by the Finnish, to name but a few examples. These strongly shared convictions result directly from that shared cultural and social history, and breed distrust of anyone who would hold authority over the group but not share those same aims and expectations . If the government is not considered to be representative, then it will struggle to claim legitimacy, and will only maintain its control by becoming increasingly authoritarian and remote from the people it claims to serve.

Of course the transnational progressives would have it otherwise given their ideological distrust of the sovereign nation state, its call of loyalty is an interference in what they consider to be far more important group identities, and they do have a point because, remember, the EU was born of fear.

Throughout centuries of brutal warfare, from the Thirty Years War, the Napolenic War, the Franco-Prussian War, the First World War, the Second World War, and many more, europe has suffered political instability repression and revolution. How many EU countries have not been facist, communist, revolutionary, dictatorships, or repeatedly invaded in the last three hundred and fifty years? Only one. Have many have suffered at least one of the above within living memory? The rest. The EU represents stability to the continent, a framework for peaceful cooperation for the past half century.

The fascination with using proportionalism in defence of ‘victim’ groups, the institutionalisation of multitudinous identities, and the end of majority rule in favour of power sharing, all of these serve to break the network of trust that binds the citizen to their state, to be replaced with endless waltz of realignments as you ceaselessly redefine your identity, and a serf-like deference to a supra-national authority. You are too busy to care about the previous loyalty, and anyway, wasn’t it replaced by something ‘higher’?

All of this must be at least somewhat appealing to peoples who have never been properly protected by their state, whose shifting borders have left pockets of ‘others’ cheek-by-jowl with people whom they share no common history, and people who retain a nascent wariness of whatever catastrophe  will next be inflicted upon them by their neighbours. Wouldn’t it be so much better if there were a less contentious way to live…………

It is no coincidence that many european states have a political system based on proportional representation, why would you not when repeated trauma and dislocation prevent the electorate from trusting the politician not to become a tyrant, and the politician from trusting the electorate not to install a demagogue.

As for Britain, remember that although the EU was born of fear we joined for economic reasons, and that we have not in recent history suffered; unstable borders, traumatised populace, displaced people, revolutions, fascism, communism, or dictatorship. Britain is an island nation, as a result of which we have no compelling motive to dilute our aims and expectations with groups whom we do not share a common history, that fear does not exist. The first-past-the-post electoral system is more than anything a declaration of trust in the cohesiveness of ones society, and by the same token a rejection of the victim politics commonly used to justify proportional representation.

There is without doubt a new era of friendly european cooperation, to which some credit must be given the EU, the only question that remains is for how long that remnant fear of the past will cause some individuals to keep pushing for “ever-deeper-union” when the utopia has already been achieved………. that of a tranquil europe.",0,1353858026,null,0,false,0,c76hemh,t3_13r9w5,t1_c76hemh,t3_13r9w5,null,1430495119,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Mettiamola così: da non credente ritengo tuttavia che il buon Dio abbia distribuito a tutti le stesse capacità. Questo significherebbe che, a parità di interesse per un dato ruolo, in base al merito dovrebbe esserci un fisiologico 50% di posti occupati da uomini e un 50% da donne (tralasciando le minoranze di identità sessuale). 

Non mi pare che le composizioni degli organici rispecchino questo dato. 

E quindi se in astratto a tutti gli abili devono essere date le stesse possibilità (*art. 3) sappiamo che questo è molto lontano dal vero. 

Se magari si parlasse meno di meritocrazia per applicarla di più non avremmo bisogno di alterare con delle direttive una palese disparità (e forse non staremmo nel pantano della politica degli amici e dei raccomandati).

&gt; In other matters than those described in Articles 74 and 77, **draft bills adopted by the House of Representatives are sent to the Senate**

&gt;At the request of at least fifteen senators, the Senate examines the draft bills. This request is made within fifteen days of the draft bill being received.

&gt; ...

&gt; If the Senate does not pronounce on the bill within the time allotted, or if the Senate has informed the House of Representatives of its decision not to amend, **the bill is sent by the House of Representatives to the King.**

&gt; If the bill has been amended, the Senate sends it to the **House of Representatives, which makes a final decision by either adopting or rejecting** all or some of the amendments adopted by the Senate.

sounds normal so far. But maybe this:

&gt; **No act of the King can take effect without the countersignature of a minister**, who, in doing so, assumes responsibility for it.

&gt; ...

&gt;The King makes decrees and regulations required for the execution of laws, without ever having the power either to suspend the laws themselves or to grant dispensation from their execution.


&gt;**The King sanctions and promulgates laws.**


So if I'm reading this right, parliament can propose the laws, can vote on those laws, and make them effective all on its own. BUT the king needs to sign the law in the end, and for that he needs a co-signature of a minister, right?

So, no laws w/o a government. Pity, since that last step seems a mere formality anyhow - since neither the king nor the minister seem to be able to refuse that signature.

This was unprecedented; although Baudoin was nominally Belgium's chief executive, Royal Assent has long been a formality (as is the case in most constitutional and popular monarchies). However, due to his religious convictions, Baudouin asked the Government to declare him temporarily unable to reign so that he could avoid signing the measure into law.[3] The Government under Wilfried Martens complied with his request on 4 April 1990. According to the provisions of the Belgian Constitution, in the event the King is temporarily unable to reign, the Government as a whole fulfills the role of Head of State.

- Tropical paradise : the 4 ""DOM/TOM"" (Martinique, Guadeloupe, Réunion, Guyane), and Corse.

Nice is obviously in an incredibly beautiful area - you are short train rides from Cap Ferrat, Cap d'Ail, Eze, Antibes, Monaco, etc, etc, etc. There is quite a cool ex-pat community. Wayne's Bar is legendary among the young Anglo's, and the night life is good. My only problem with Nice is that the town centre isn't all that welcoming - people are either very aggressively French or posh. I found that I socialised less in Nice but really, really, enjoyed exploring the surrounding areas. Come to think of it, I spent very little time in Nice and most of my time in neighbouring beaches.

Montpellier is awesome if you want to meet young people. It's a fairly small town but it's got 3 or 4 universities. It's a very beautiful town being medieval and the medical university is one of the oldest in Europe. It is definitely more historically interesting than Nice and I preferred it as a place to live. Make sure to give the couchsurfing community there a go. The beaches are no where near as nice as in Nice, although they are sandy. There are some cool places to travel to but maybe not as easy compared to Nice. Places like Pont du Gard and a massive national park in the area. La Grande Motte is also worth a visit.

It's probably a difficult decision - Nice and the immediate area are pretty much paradise, but the town itself lacks a bit of...something. Montpellier is a very young town and with historic charm. The surrounding areas are probably not as much like paradise, but maybe better for weekends away. 

In terms of travelling on eurorail it really won't make much difference - France has a good rail system wherever you are.

What these parties have promised is an official referendum to learn the actual proportion of Catalans who support independence (which the central governments, usually Spanish nationalists, have kept denying to the regions that have tried before).

Additionally, the article only mentions economic reasons for the separation, but these have only recently become the most heard among pro-independence Catalans. Historically, there has been a cultural struggle between some regions and the central power (ones seeking to reinforce local culture against minorization, others trying to culturally homogenize the state) which has kept steadily adding wood to the fire (specially in times of very nationalist central governments, as is now the case).

My personal opinion about the issue (I'm not Catalan) is that there's better solutions than independence to their problems, specially now; still, denying them the right to referendum is something I think no democrat should support. And if it shows that the majority wanted independence, then they should go ahead: a state is one form of social contract after all, and it shouldn't exist without all parts agreeing to it.

// bbc:


Belgium has sworn in a new government, ending a record-breaking 541 days of political deadlock.

New Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo was sworn in by King Albert II at the royal palace along with his 12 cabinet ministers and six secretaries of state.

Mr Di Rupo, a French-speaking Socialist, took the oath of office in French, Dutch and German - reflecting language sensitivities in the country.

The Europe crisis is thought to have spurred politicians to find a solution.

Belgium had been run by a ***caretaker administration*** since the last government resigned in April 2010.

***Caretaker governments*** are expected to handle daily issues and prepare budgets for discussion, but are not expected to produce a government platform or introduce controversial bills.

&gt;‘When my cover was blown it destroyed my life. **I lost my job, my girlfriend and my reputation.**

&gt;Ten women and one man are also suing the Met for emotional trauma saying they were duped into having sex with undercover officers. **Three of the women are ex-lovers of Kennedy.**

&gt;Their lawsuit states: ‘The men .  .  . **used techniques they had been trained in to gain trust and thereby create the illusion they might be a “soulmate” to the women.** There is no doubt that the officers obtained the consent of these women to sexual intercourse by deceit.’

&gt;Married Kennedy, who **is now going through a divorce from his wife** Edel, operated under the alias of Mark Stone, a long-haired heavily tattooed climber. **The father of two** worked for the secretive National Public Order Intelligence Unit. He says he cost the taxpayer £250,000  a year in wages and costs.

&gt;Kennedy says he **had to have sex with the protesters to protect his cover.**

So he blew his cover/ his cover was blown and instead of taking responsibility for sleeping with a handful of women behind his wife and two children, he's blaming NPOIU. Nice guy.

That the secessionist leaders are strutting around with a firm chin and misty eyes, leading their people out of the desert into the land of milk and honey, obliquely referencing a mystical past, full of, er, bagpipes, kilts, Robbie Burns, and bright-eyed children, all while the basic plausibility of the culturally homogenous nation-state shifts beneath their feet.

It strikes me that the economic success, decency, and internationalist outlook of countries like Sweden and Denmark are partly down to their ability to maintain greater solidarity within a smaller, more homogenous unit, while realizing the need to engage with, compete with, and understand the outside world. It might well be that smaller countries mean a better quality of life, but larger countries will control the world, through their simple ability to act as a power block.

If you want your floors cleaned you may hire someone to clean them for you. Cleaning floors is working with your hands. You don't buy the clean floors from the cleaner, you pay the cleaner money in exchange for the work he does.  
It's the same with information. If you want some software or music you may hire someone to make it for you. Playing music is working with your hands. Programming is working with your hands. You don't buy the information resulting from their work (the music, software..), you could just as well get a copy of that from a friend or from the internet. Instead you pay them money in exchange for the work they do, just as with the cleaner. 

Copyright is then just a method for facilitating a huge group or people collectively paying for the musicians' and programmers' time and work. We force everyone to pay if they want a copy, and this way musicians and programmers get paid.  
This method is far from perfect though, and we could easily switch to something better.

It's strange how these things work out, because the Franco-German alliance is in some ways the moral cornerstone of the union. The catalyst for the creation of the EU was the world wars, and the subsequent realization that conflict between France and Germany was tearing Europe apart. But you can also make an opposite case, that the alliance represents a sort of cartel behaviour towards the rest of the EU, a power bloc which can largely determine policy regardless of other opinions. For instance, when the fiscal compact was on the table, you could make the case that the basic negotiation should have been between the core and the periphery, that the periphery would give up some measure of fiscal sovereignty, and in return the core would do something, have a banking union, or introduce eurobonds, or something. That there would be a grand symbolic trade-off, which everyone could understand. But as it turned out, the negotiation was between France and Germany - Germany wanted fiscal controls, France wanted no more banking haircuts, and the periphery countries hardly came into it at all. I think that it is absolutely vital for the legitimacy of the union that France and Germany don't present a totally united front, and can actually disagree on some subjects, and that alliances pop up here and there according to a more egalitarian, transparent process, which is open to public opinion amongst the European citizenry.

That being said, every city you listed seems amazing to be in (well, except for Schwäbisch Hall. It seems more the type of idyllic ""big village"", but I have not been there myself).
The problem you will face in Berlin, Hamburg or Munich is the Multiculturalism which is part of Germany nowadays, that will tempt you to use English. But as Timerly said, almost all  people &gt;40 years of age will help you and try to speak in English.

I would choose Berlin as well, maybe because I lived in the suburbs for many years and loved every minute I spent in Berlin. Heidelberg is amazing for Americans, there is a very big community of Americans there and in Mannheim, where I live now (20km to the north), but I don'z know how this will change because of the relocation of the US Army from Heidelberg to Wiesbaden. Heidelberg has also a very famous university, so good choice for your studies. Munich and Berlin would be cool as well, as they have good universities and many good bars, clubs and parks.",0,1353880254,null,0,false,0,c76n0rc,t3_13rpis,t1_c76n0rc,t1_c76lxib,null,1430497829,2,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,2

The nightlife here is great; there are more bars than you can shake a stick at, and the city has something like 60,000 students...so yeah, that's pretty great.

The airport isn't the best, but cheap flights to Paris and London, and a few other cities. It's right next to Marseille, so international travel is still pretty dang affordable. 

Being a Mediterranean city, Montpellier is basically a tropical paradise still. It's the end of November and I was outside wearing shorts and a t-shirt today...and it felt awesome! But I will concede that the coat is necessary at night.

Historically, Montpellier and the surrounding cities/towns are culturally rich. The historic district here still awes me after three months everytime I'm there, which is basically daily since I live right next to it and work there.

Sono andato a votare perché credo fermamente nelle primarie come forma di democrazia, e credo che partecipare sia un atto di responsabilità necessario. 

Nessuno dei candidati mi piace davvero. Sono stato piuttosto indeciso fino all'ultimo, alla fine ho votato Renzi, un po' a malincuore a dire il vero. Renzi non mi piace molto, su alcuni punti del suo programma sono d'accordo, su altri no (troppo timido sui diritti delle coppie omosessuali, per dire). La mia intenzione era votare Vendola per esprimere un consenso a posizioni più di sinistra nella coalizione, e poi scegliere Renzi al ballottaggio (non credo ci sia mai stata la prospettiva di vedere Vendola vittorioso). Alla fine però ho avuto, forse ingenuamente, paura dei sondaggi che davano Bersani oltre il 50%. 

E intendevo fermamente dare un segnale all'apparato del PD che da vent'anni corre con la stessa gente e da vent'anni perde. Bersani sostenuto da D'Alema, Bindi ecc. non poteva avere il mio voto. Bersani sostenuto dalla CGIL, un sindacato che sembra non avere assolutamente riconosciuto i cambiamenti del mercato del lavoro e che continua a combattere battaglie su principi del tutto astratti dalla realtà. Per dire, la CGIL i precari non se li incula nemmeno un po'. 

Mandare Bersani alle elezioni equivarrebbe all'ennesimo fallimento o all'ennesima vittoria risicata. Renzi è l'unico modo per vedere il PD al governo, e forse con un certo margine. Ho visto quello che ha fatto a Firenze e, nonostante non tutto quello che ha fatto mi sia piaciuto, è stata una boccata d'aria fresca rispetto a quello che c'era prima, gente con tutta la rigidità e la chiusura dell'ex-PCI ma senza idee di sinistra (Renzi alle primarie scalzò Cioni, il candidato ""ufficiale"" sostenuto da Roma che fu quello dell'ordinanza contro i mendicanti ai semafori). 
Boh, forse ho sbagliato, ma c'ho provato. Mi ha fatto piacere trovare la fila al seggio. Mi fa piacere che la gente si appassioni di nuovo, anche se mi intristisce vedere i toni acri che assumono gli scambi tra elettori (tra i miei contatti facebook, per dire, volano parole poco simpatiche tra Vendoliani, Bersaniani, e Renziani).

In Galicia people tend to be more guarded about showing their emotions. You'll see fewer demonstrations of enthusiasm, people don't greet everyone in the morning, etc., etc. Even we tend to use guarded language; for example, a common way to say that something was good is to say that we've had worse. This is something I try to avoid here because it's always taken the wrong way, but I often do it unconsciously so I always make sure to warn my coworkers and any people that I'm going to interact with for an extended time :)

The flip side of this is that we tend to see frequent smiles, expressions of enthusiasm, etc., as insincere. It's common to perceive Americans as ""fake"" due to frequent displays of friendliness that are seen as superficial. So don't be surprised if someone accuses you of acting fake.

If you learn a few expressions in Galician people will like you. If you learn some conversational Galician, people will *love* you. Also, old ladies will talk your ears off if you let them.

The attitude towards alcohol is different too. It's not uncommon to drink wine during meals. If the meal is a social event, it's common to have liquors afterwards (sips, not shots!). The objective is not to get smashed to have fun, but to put some spice on the fun you are already having.

Ah, another interesting note: people will talk trash about Spain all the time.

Almost all of it, yes, but you still need to use your hands. Cleaning floors is mostly work with your hands, but you still need your brains to do it.

I'm thinking abut publishers and their like. They get a lot of the money, but the work they are doing is not needed. The internet made them redundant.

No rights are natural. The rights I'm talking about are something like the right to due process, right to privacy and private communication, freedom of speech, stuff like that. We are losing our rights to the fight on file sharing, terror and CP.

&gt;You don't pay for a copy, you pay for a right to play a copy.

You are not allowed to download a copy unless you pay. So you pay for a copy. The fact that you don't own what you buy is another problem. Free and libre software solves that.

&gt;Do you have a formal proof for that or are you just talking quasi-intellectual populist vapour?

When file sharing is illegal our rights are being threatened. This is reason enough to legalise file sharing.  
Even then, those who participate in unauthorised copying are found to spend more money than those who don't. People spend money on Kickstarter and Flattr.  
Sharing information is a great thing.
