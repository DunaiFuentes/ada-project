true,rpad,null,null,"Sorry, but what are you talking about? What is ""written into the constitution"" about the CB chief? Cause i can't recollect anything about that. All your arguments are like that. Collect every issue, half-truth or straight-out lie and combine them into a concept. If you are thinking about the requirement to keep the budget deficit low, you damn well can expect that to be enforced, even if a socialist government gets into power again. Since it was them in the first place who racked up the debt, not the current government.

You want a cycle of a conservative government enforcing austerity and sane finances, just so the next socialist government can go on a spending spree again? Is this all about that? Well fuck you, no more socialist style ""vote purchasing"" measures for you, even if you win an election again. Do you even know what measures did the socialists do in 2005-2006, such they managed to bribe their voters? Did you hear about the Öszöd speech? Why do you think that enforcing these guarantees are not justified, considering the actual practices that went on during the socialists?

Your objection is that the constitution prevents a future would-be socialist government from letting the deficit run off again. It somehow is considered a bad practice to make a guarantee for that. And why is the current government doing that for a future government? Because its the currently in opposition socialists who are unable to guarantee that by themselves. Simply put, ""we need to hold the hands of the socialists, because they are unable to restrain themselves from ruining state finances again"". 

While a block on state deficit was put into constitutions of other countries too, and the whole new EU deal is about making guarantees for a low deficit, in case of Hungary you consider such a move a sign a dictatorial tendencies. Just on what base you think that Fidesz would use/need that guarantee for a maneuver to remove a future socialist government from power? That logic is the logic of the socialists themselves. You hear it emphasized, because its what they are thinking and talking, *thats what they would do*. Its not what Fidesz is thinking about, when it puts a guarantee like that into the constitution. 

So instead of welcoming such a move, you stand on the side of the crocks, just from a political consideration. Btw, the central bank chief was **always** been appointed by the government in Hungary, as much everywhere else, i don't know why that should change, even if the EU bureaucracy got carried away in their sudden increase of power.

I don't know how reliable this list is this Adolf Otto for example is linked to a guy that died a long time before http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Otto

However most on the list are just guys that joined the ranks of the NSDAP, Reichsdienst or other at young age &gt;19 and turned to antifascists (during the war, in resistance or after some reeducation).

&gt; After the Stasi archives were opened up, it turned out that the actual number seems to have been more in the thousands.

However if the question is about how were these guys involved in crimes against humanity or other crimes, what could be a better proof than Jewish Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal not finding hidden nazis  criminal in East Germany after the opening of the STASI archives?

Summary: There is a lot that can be said about the GDR, and you can like or dislike the state or parts of its politics, when it comes to the antifascism that was a real fundation of this state, no matter what is said after the unfriendly takeover. 

Don't believe it? It's because of its stout antifascist foundation, that the former-GDR saw such drastic changes, a late revenge of the Western *Altnazis*

Since the *""reunification""* the antifascist memorials that are scattered all over the former-GDR have been removed, former concentration camp sites and museums have been closed to the public, streets &amp; other public places, hospitals, schools etc.  honoring antifascists have been renamed, memorials vandalized, removed or not maintained, honorary pensions of antifascists and resistance fighter have been cut!, should I go on with the surveillance of old resistance fighters and communists (not the antifa, I mean the grandpas that really fought against Hitler including old Spain fighters). Maybe one more example to intensify the contrast Otto Jürgens the Waldheim judge, who prosecuted thousands of Nazis was tried in 1993. Unlike all these Altnazis who can always claim health problems, this excuse wasn't enough for the 86 year old actual antifascist Otto Jürgens who was finally sentenced to 2 years on probation, still two years less than Jendretzky's sentence, another prosecuted Waldheim judge among others.

Of course the GDR leadership didn't like the fact that he published his book that countered their propaganda. Erich Mielke accused him to be an anticommunist front pig exactly like you just did. I don't think that one can expect a fair judgement from SED and Stasi leaders, do you? Mielke even assembled a special unit in his security service that was supposed to neutralize Kappelt, they even sent a bunch of goons after him and delivered a funeral wreath to his flat marked with ""Last greetings to Olaf"". On of the Stasi goons, Aribert Freder, who tried to intimidate Kappelt repeatedly was later found guilty of killing another DDR-dissident, Bernd Moldenhauer, and then incarcerated, so this wasn't just an empty threat.

&gt; I don't know how reliable this list is this Adolf Otto for example is linked to a guy that died a long time before http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Otto

Yes, wikipedia is unreliable, they confused Adolf Otto with a different guy with the same name.

&gt; However if the question is about how were these guys involved in crimes against humanity or other crimes

You're moving the goal posts, because your original claim was that there weren't any Nazi officials in the GDR elites, not war criminals. War criminals were persecuted and tried in Western Germany as well, while merely NSDAP members or officials weren't; so in this respect the GDR and the BRD acted pretty much the same. The difference is that Western Germany never pretended to be a state of antifascist resistance fighters, but accepted their culpability.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;If you raise taxes too precipitously in order to increase spending then don't you end up placing too great a burden on the private sector which is attempting to recover from whatever recession you're trying to get out of?   
  
Yes, which is why Keynesian counter-cyclical spending is typically financed through borrowing.  That way, you can cut taxes *and* increase spending during a recession, and not have to actually pay for it until the economy has recovered.  At that point, people can afford higher taxes again, and you can afford to pay off the debt you incurred.  
  
Also remember that debt financing can be cheaper in the long term than taxation anyway, if the bond yield is lower than the long term rate of inflation.  Sometimes going into debt simply saves the taxpayer money.  
  
&gt;It seems to me Keynesian spending works fine when you go into a recession with a low level of government debt, preferably a budget surplus, indeed wasn't that Keynes doctrine to begin with, run a surplus in the good times and a deficit in the bad times?  
  
&gt;Seems like everyone is a good Keynesian in the bad times but a terrible one in the good times.  
  
Indeed.  I'm no Keynesian, but at least if we're going to apply counter-cyclical fiscal policy, we should apply it on both sides of a recession, rather than increasing the debt during the boom years as well as the lean years.  That's my main criticism of Gordon Brown's tenure as Chancellor of the Exchequer - the common complaint that he 'didn't fix the roof while the sun was shining', increasing debt at a time where [bond yields](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/government-bond-yield) were above [inflation](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/inflation-cpi).",0,1331288021,null,0,true,0,c3z85yc,t3_qn6x9,t1_c3z85yc,t1_c3z2qev,null,1428494099,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

On the opposite side you have the basic appeal to nationalism and isolationism, which were the main culprit along history for virtually all the wars, the other major culprit being religious belief. This is why I prefer this ""hypocritical"" peace to some ""honest"" war.

This leaves multiculturalism and immigration policy. The first one is entirely debatable depending on how you interpret the term: if it means the drive for the preservation of cultural identity within a fair legal framework, you can't possibly argue against it, if it devolves into ""positive discrimination"" and the introduction of the legal concept of ""cultural defence"" (a view held only by a small fraction of the left wing) then it is indeed reprehensible.

As for immigration, I view it as a fundamental right, which can be broken up into several others: the right to free movement, the right to pursue happiness, the right of seeking the best pay for one's skillset, the right to compete in the work force market unimpeded and the list could go on.

I would suggest that Europeans in general have a far better understanding of your geography than you have of ours. In fact as a Brit I'd go so far as to say that my understanding of your country's geopolitical make-up is actually better than my knowledge of Europe.

I very much doubt you could name many/any of their provinces (they have under half the number of States that you have), let alone their main cities. Neither could I, and perhaps I should be able to.

Returning to my original point though: state capitols have almost no relevance outside of the US. Iowa doesn't send us a fucking ambassador :P Birmingham is our 2nd largest city, but I rightly wouldn't expect you guys to give a fuck about it (and rightly so; it's pretty much a shithole).

(And quite relevant here as Brazil's economy just overtook the UK's)... ""Africa"" is not an economic superpower, it would make no sense to represent them in this video. It is representing 3 very specific countries, not colours of skin.

Surely the ending of the ad is enough to convince you anyway? Where when all the countries of Europe are together, we are finally able to contend with these others... but not to fight, as you might have noticed! It's implying that we can be more at peace and have an equal place in the world if we act as one entity, there's no intent of malice or anything there, it's just a fact of reality - that is how the world we live in is currently structured, and this ad merely represents that through a creative medium.

And as I said before the aggression is about economies, it's not about war/peace or allies/enemies. That wouldn't even make sense given what happens in this video.

Also I feel I must contend the other point - you're saying they're depicted as **barbarians**... are you insane!? They're depicted as prestegious martial artists, they're depicted in a way that these countries have depicted themselves for decades! They make movies about these people and export them all over the world! Martial arts are huge cultural exports, and I think people of most countries with martial art traditions such as these would be quite happy to have martial artists represent their country.

*Edit: I would add to this again to say that this ad is also promoting the expansion of the EU, to include more people, more cultures, more races, more shades of skin. Yes, it completely failed in doing that apparently, but it's not the fault of the video that some people can't see the past colour of someones skin. If those 3 countries were all predominantly white and the video showed 3 white people practising their martial arts then there would have been no uproar. It's no ones fault that indian people are brown - if you want to depict India, you get an Indian person. They are brown. Live with it.

If you want to argue about European isolation, nationalism, whatever - it might be a little more valid. Racism and xenophobia is nowhere near the mark.

&gt;I think that it's a problem that you don't know any of our states and that's deplorable.

&gt;California is the 8th largest economy in the world

I did learn your states and the state capitals at school, and I also knew that California was the 8th largest economy in the world. You are making a lot of assumptions, all of them completely incorrect I might add.


&gt;How is it a problem? 

The subject of geography isn't just capitals and rivers. As you pointed out in your example about California, it also contains information about history, economy etc. The fact that your population knows little of what happens and the countries outside of it's borders is a huge problem because:

When the US, deals, interfers and *goes to war* with other countries, it affects us, the non-US people. You have been at war and invaded Iraq, still 63 %(!!!) of your population can't find that on a map. How many of it millions of refugees have you taken in for example?


You vote for people who routinely interfer with other countries (or invade them) yet, when you vote, you place little importance of what your government does outside of your country.


You might go to war with Iran now. Can most Americans find it on a map? Do most Americans now that *one* of the reasons that they hate you is that you deposed of a *democratic* elected president to replace him with a corrupt shah? You learn those things in geography. Do any of you care ? It affects *me* how you vote, so your ignorance affects me. I don't care half as much about your backward thinking (although I think it's wrong) when it comes to your attitudes towards gay people, abortions, health care, because that is *within* your country. However, when you keep on electing people who invades at whims, it *does* affect me.


But, since the only thing you care about is finances, you *might* know that Iran has oil '- well, let's go to war then.

[Here](http://www.economywatch.com/economies-in-top/?page=full) is a list over the 10 biggest economys in the world. Iran is not on it, so I guess you can invade then?

I think you are mistaken to try to separate these out so distinctly. The fortress europe idea is based on an attitude that Europe is cooperation and civilization, countries that can be trusted not to do us harm, and outside is a threat. Why should that be the case? In reality, racism is very rarely seen in a pure form, but is intermixed with ideas about cultural superiority.

Oh that **is** the point and I totally agree that that is the case and I am not even that particularly happy that it is. But that doesn't change anything.

That is simply reality, that is what happens with countries and economies. We're not ""right"", this video is all about the EU's self interests and being able to get as much as we can for ourselves. Hell it's even about us wanting to exploit those developing countries rather than let China exploit them. It's not racism, it's economic competition.

I don't see why you see the stereotypes as negative though? I thought they all looked awesome, I thought people loved this martial arts stuff? Don't we aggandise these people and respect them as being powerful fighters who have devoted their lives to their culture and craft? Maybe I just like martial arts movies too much, but I don't see any negative connotation in the actual characters.

But okay, there is the fact that they are aggressors and getting ready to fight - all I can do it loop back around to my original argument and say that is simply the reality of these economies. They bully us, we bully them - we bully everyone else too. We're not ""right"", we're just doing the same shit as everyone else and this ad is promoting our position to do that better than we do currently!

My point was that as far as important countries in Europe; Cyprus certainly isn't one of them (and that's fine, there's nothing wrong with being in a small country). My Offence stems from the misleading title of 'americans' instead of 'CNN'. I don't know what the capital of your country is, but you probably don't know what the capital of my state is (and that's fine too, it's not important to know, or remember what a capital city is if it's not a major player in world affairs). 

Also, i draw the parallel to your country to New York State because New York State is bigger economically and geographically and /should/ be considered higher in importance than cyprus (N.Y.S. GDP = $1,156,500,000,000 Cyprus = $23,190,000,000; Cyprus GDP is roughly 2% of New York State) (N.Y.S. Area 141,300 km2; Cyprus Area 9,251 km2; about 6.5% of New York State).

now, all of this i don't really care about; borders are pretty much pointless. But Americans were called out for not knowing what the Capital of Cyprus is, and i argue that most Europeans couldn't name New York's Capital City.

Please, Italians are responsible for Berlusconi, Greeks for their mess, of course you are responsible for the wars you go to and the countries you invade.

Well, if you had read the studies I linked to, you would see that it is proven that Americans *are* worse at geography. Perhaps not *you* as an individual, but as  whole, you are. Or are you saying that the studies are wrong? Then please, link to some counterevidence. I have access to all major scientific journals. Otherwise, the title is a bit correct, although I can see why you do not like it.


&gt;But Americans were called out for not knowing what the Capital of Cyprus is, and i argue that most Europeans couldn't name New York's Capital City

Probably not, but we do learn it in school. I also dare to venture on the fact that neither can most Americans. You are making a lot of assumptions in this thread about our education, none of them true I might add. Also, you are basing you whole reasoning on the size of the GDP. Well, then we should all ignore Israel, shouldn't we, but that is not very likely. Economy isn't the only thing in the world, and I honestly feel sad for you if that is how you base things. There are a lot of wonderful things that are not finance based or on a top ten.

Apology accepted, and that did piss me off, although I am not from Cyprus :-). I have been there though and it was lovely. 


Part of the argument is also that one is supposed to know the capitals of countries in Europe, just like you are very uneducated if you only speak one language (or old). I know Cyprus is a small country and more people would know Paris or Berlin. I know it's not the same in the US, and that is a cultural divide I think you have against the rest of the world. I understand part if it, given that you are a huge country, with lots of provinces/states but so is Russia, India and China for example, and they good at geography-it must be about the importance you place on it.


Another reason I reacted is that I honestly find it frightening that you are/were at war with a country most people can't find on the map. It does not bode well for the future, neither for Europe or the US (or Iran). How is the reasoning behind your wars and interventions? If most people do not know the country, they do not care to stop it either. It *is* affecting your foreign policy, that is why I react.

First of all we're still running the whole world on oil, etc. which is now in a permanent price rise as demand is constantly far higher than supply. But okay, we can replace that dependenec slowly but surely (probably not fast enough to maintain standard of living without economic growth, though).

Secondly with low growth we can't get the same trade deals to import cheap stuff. Other countries would take over that, right?

Now you seem to be saying that that doesn't matter as we'd be working internally and have trade barriers anyway... but do you really think our standard of living can be sustained without international trade? I'm not sure, I honestly don't think it would be a bad thing to try to do slowly anyway as we clearly should be more locally and self-reliant...

true,Chudley,UNSA,United States,"I think that the reason we americans don't have a great understanding about world geography is that we're incredibly proud to be Americans and anything foreign is either a novelty (Ikea) or a bad thing (chinese merchandise). We always want to be bigger and better than everyone else and because of our size and economy we're allowed to do that. We *were* the first for a lot of very progressive ideas: women voting, industry, etc.. and we were afforded a lot because after World War II we didn't have any competition and had many factories. Now the world has changed and a lot of the things that made America great either are old or simply not possible any more and the biggest generation (the baby boomers) are stuck in their old ways. When you look at the world today, with the glasses of the 1950 &amp; 60's, then you see the mistakes that it seems you're angry at.

Another reason is in our culture it's work work work work work work work; and it's been this way since the early puritans that first came to this country. It's a society that says you only get what you earn; and this is a double edged sword. You'll get people working very hard, but also those who don't know how to work hard will get left behind. Also, with our work work work mentality we don't often have time to travel, and taking too many days off in a row (even if sick) is frowned upon. I haven't really understood why this is yet, but it certainly does affect us a society. Now, as we don't  have a lot of time to travel we only see the United States (also it's all English) and thus only care about where they're traveling to. Another point is that if it's 8hrs of travel to go anywhere of importance outside the united states then people aren't going to be wanting to waste 2 of their vacation days just in the air.

All this are excuses. We as Americans should know more about geography, but if people aren't pushed to learn more and actively punished with the time in the air to get anywhere, then they're just not going to want to travel.",0,1331321705,null,0,false,0,c3zcj0d,t3_qnthx,t1_c3zcj0d,t1_c3zbsdw,null,1428496252,-1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-1

Sorry to be picky, but New Zeeland for women and the Industrial revolution in Britain.... Not saying you didn't do them though, but you were not the first.

I found what you wrote otherwise interesting. One thing I don't quite agree with is that 

&gt;with the glasses of the 1950 &amp; 60's, then you see the mistakes that it seems you're angry at.

I'm angry at Iraq, not Vietnam, angry at not accepting climate change, the blind support of Israel without helping the Palestinians to get a state of their own too etc -things that are happening now. Sure, what you did before has had an effect and influences what people think (like in Iran) but I don't really have a problem with your current government for the ""before"" things. 


Sorry, will stop nitpicking now :-). 

I think you are right in a lot of ways. Most people (which also includes Americans) that travel quickly learn that they need to know ""other countries stuff"". It is more common/easier to do that in Europe. 


&gt;Another point is that if it's 8hrs of travel to go anywhere of importance outside the united states then people aren't going to be wanting to waste 2 of their vacation days just in the air.

True, you need more vacation days!

Also one thing that work to your disadvante is that you speak English, then it's not as necessary to learn another language, thus discovering the culture.


&gt;We as Americans should know more about geography,

I know, at it frightens me that you don't, particularely when you vote.

How do you think one can go about changing that? 

The only things I can think of right now are two, rather different things. You turn massively to the left, invest more in schools etc, essentially Canada, which means more traveling, but also different focus of the schools.Super unlikely.


The other one is that as you ""fall"" on the International importance ladder (you will eventually, every country does and other countries rises) you realise that you have to change your focus of and invest more in schools/education etc. Also, as you fall you automatically become more dependent on others, thus needs to know more about them.Could happen eventually I suppose

First of all, how are your language skills? I've met a large number of servers who believed and argued with me that a ""vegetalien"" is a ""vegetarien"" who doesn't eat fish &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;  so unless you go to exclusively veg restaurants, be ready to get into detailed specifics of what your restrictions are. If your French is not great, I'd get someone to write you a cheat sheet that you can show to servers and cooks where you'll eat out. 

As a rule, you'll have more luck finding veg options in ethnic eateries (North African, Middle Eastern, Indian etc) but I know it's not always possible to choose where you'll eat when traveling for work. If non-veg partners plan business lunches/dinners on your behalf, try to call the place beforehand so that they can plan something for you. Non contamination for people with dietary restrictions or allergies is not a big concern in France so they might not have vegetarian broths or sauces -or really, any means of preparing you a decent meal- unless you give them a heads-up and plenty of time. 

Bread typically has no animal products unless specified otherwise (*pain au lait*, etc), and if you eat cheese and don't care about rennet you could probably live off the stuff. But if you'd like a bit more variety...

Shops: 

- both Monoprix and Carrefour (supermarket chains found all over France) have organic/veg sections with wonderful products.Try Sojasun or Danone soy yogurts, they are probably the best soy yogurts on the planet. They will also have many products of the Bjorg health food line, plenty of which are veg*n. The burgers and pates in particular are great for quick meals. They also have a large variety of plant milks - the hazelnut milk is my all-time favorite and amaaaaazing for lattes.

- Naturalia is a health food store chain found all over France with a nice seitan/tofu/faux meat selection.

- La Nature à Paris (45, Bd. St. Germain, 75005): another health food store in the Quartier Latin.

Restaurants (check that they still exist, my recommendations may be slightly outdated):

- L’as du falafel (34 Rue des Rosiers, 75004). There are a lot of falafel shops in that district but this one is particularly amazing.

- Les Cinq saveurs d’anada (72 Rue Cardinal Lemoine, 75005)
Mostly vegan and macrobiotic. 

- Le Potager du Marais (22, rue Rambuteau, 75004)
Organic, Macrobiotic, entirely vegetarian.

- Saveurs Veget'Halles (41, rue des Bourdonnais, 75001)

When I said to a friend of mine the Libyan rebels were dicks, she agreed, but then when I brought up their racism she brought up their sexism. Now I am still proud of the article I wrote, it is a story which isn't nearly reported enough that the black community of Libya is suffering, but it hit me when she said it that I had potentially missed something major of the picture.

Half an hour of research later I had a fairly clear picture that women too were being abused but in different ways, ways in which I needed to then consider my own society as well. We quite often don't notice sexism in our society and bring it to light. I wrote my second article about women in Libya and their mistreatment by Gaddafi and by the rebels, but I don't have high hopes for it getting published. The world affairs part of the comment section will almost certainly be occupied by Kony related affairs and women will, as always, be swept beneath the editorial rug. In the Libyan case it is because it isn't quite as obvious that women are being mistreated, we hear stories of rape but this is - shockingly - accepted as a fact of war and passes with relatively little comment as  in opaque terms - it's ""just that sort of thing"" that happens.

(In halal slaughtering, the animal is not stunned before its throat is cut, but that is a difference without material distinction for the end product.)

A little more context. By the way, I personnally find it hard to believe ANYTHING the National Front says.

As to whether or not it is a ""barbaric"" practice, I'd say that it's in the eye of the viewer-and the mouth of the speaker.
""Barbarian and savage are terms used to refer to a person who is perceived to be uncivilized. The word is often used either in a general reference to a member of a nation or ethnos, typically a tribal society as seen by an urban civilization either viewed as inferior, or admired as a noble savage. In idiomatic or figurative usage, a ""barbarian"" may also be an individual reference to a brutal, cruel, warlike, insensitive person"". [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbarian)

There's a difference between calling a practice ""barbaric"" and calling it ""cruel"". It's like the difference between calling a conflict a ""war"" and calling it a ""crusade"".

Ich habe soweit gluck gehabt, dass ich was ich wollte studieren konnte. Im moment forsche ich in einer Erdwissenschaftfakultaet aber ursprunglich bin ich Physiker. Ich muss auch Stunden vor dem Komputer verbringen.

Geschichte ist sehr interessant. Ich muss es zugeben; ich wollte es in der Schule eigentlich nicht studieren. Ich wurde gezwungen, weil zu wenig andere Leute Geographie lernen wollte. Ich bin aber froh, dass ich das gemacht habe, weil es so interessant war. Ich glaube in England sind die Leute sowieso noch an der Geschichte focusiert. 

Haha, ich werde gerne ueber amerikanische Politik hoeren. Es kommt naturlich oft in der Nachrichten vor aber in England wird Amerika nur positiv (am schlimsten neutral) dagestellt. Es gibt kein Kritik, deswegen finde ich es interssant zu hoeren, wie die Amerikaner sich selbst sehen. Es ist auch ein sehr unterschiedliches Land und zu unseren Sicht wird es  ziemlich homogenisiert.

Ich war Mal in Russland. Ich war 12 oder so, leider zu jung die Geschichte zu geniessen aber es war trotzdem toll. Irgendwie hat es sich gleichzeitig Europaeish und nicht-Europaeisch angefuehlt! Ich habe nur Sankt Petersburg und Moskau besucht aber was fuer Sehenswuerdigkeiten! Ehrlich gesagt kenne ich viel zu wenig ueber Russland. Ich habe ueber der Kalte Krieg gelernt aber das war lange her und ich habe der Meiste davon vergessen. Wenn du dein Master machen wuerdest, wuerdest du dich gerne auf Russland konzentieren?

Ich finde es kommisch, weil die Leute in Russland sind zum Teil sehr gebildete, es ist nicht besonders arm, die Leute haben fuer ihre Freiheit kampfen gemusst, aber sofort wurde es fast zu einer Dikatur. 

Endschuldigung, dass es ein Paar Tagen gedauert hat, bis ich geantwortet habe. 

Cycle/Circle ist der Kreis, ich glaube das kann in diesem Umstand verwenden. Ich habe auch ein paar kleine Fehler bemerkt; 'Verzeihung' ist ein Substantiv, du meintest sicher ""Verzeih meine Fehler"" (Imperativ). Ist es in Ordnung, wenn ich dich auf Fehler aufmerksam mache?

Mannheim is according to several rankings the ""best"" german-speaking business university which is also why the business courses attract about 300 exchange students every term. (In comparison there are around 1000 German business students at any time, so that's a huge amount of exchange students.)

However I believe those rankings mean nothing. If you consider yourself somewhat creative or like logical thinking avoid this university by all means. You don't need to be smart, in fact it helps, if you don't question stuff and just do stuff as they tell you. All ""Germany's best business school"" is about is learning hundreds of slides by heart.

A typical exam here is along the lines of ""we'll pick a random slide out of these 300 that you had to learn by heart and you will have to say exactly what was on that slide. Didn't consider this slide too important cause it was never part of any lecture? Fuck you, that's your problem.""

This might be different for other areas of study, but this is certainly my impression of the business courses. I'm currently in my last semester of the bachelor's program.

The city and nightlife is OK, but do keep in mind the city is a lot smaller than London. Frankfurt is much better at weekends, but the city is kinda dead during the week.

true,ttruth1,null,null,"Emissions trading is a market-based approach used to control pollution by providing economic incentives for achieving reductions in the emissions of pollutants.[1]

A central authority (usually a governmental body) sets a limit or cap on the amount of a pollutant that may be emitted. The limit or cap is allocated or sold to firms in the form of emissions permits which represent the right to emit or discharge a specific volume of the specified pollutant. Firms are required to hold a number of permits (or carbon credits) equivalent to their emissions. The total number of permits cannot exceed the cap, limiting total emissions to that level. Firms that need to increase their emission permits must buy permits from those who require fewer permits.[1]

The transfer of permits is referred to as a trade. In effect, the buyer is paying a charge for polluting, while the seller is being rewarded for having reduced emissions. Thus, in theory, those who can reduce emissions most cheaply will do so, achieving the pollution reduction at the lowest cost to society.[2]

There are active trading programs in several air pollutants. For greenhouse gases the largest is the European Union Emission Trading Scheme, whose purpose is to avoid dangerous climate change.[3] In the United States there is a national market to reduce acid rain and several regional markets in nitrogen oxides.[4] Markets for other pollutants tend to be smaller and more localized.",0,1331398776,null,0,false,0,c3zlzli,t3_qqb3b,t1_c3zlzli,t1_c3zlxzi,null,1428500767,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Every company/factory is allocated with a certain amount of CO2 (and other greenhouse gases) ""credits"" that they can pump out in the atmosphere. Companies can trade the credits among themselves, for example, if your factory just installed new filters that will reduce CO2 emissions by 20%, you can sell your allocated credits to some other firm which doesn't have those filters.

The same thing will be imposed (as of 2013) on the airline industry - allocating the CO2 credits to the airline companies, which they will be able to trade. Of course the industry opposes this (you don't say!) and American politicians are probably saying how it will ""cost companies billions in lost revenue and therefore cost millions of Americans their jobs.

Greece's corruption was facilitated mainly by Siemens and other Western Europe corporations, who found a blind man and led him to the cliff's edge. The fact that Greece did this with glee and without any thoughts for the future does not absolve anyone from their guilt.


I believe that reforms in Greece are necessary, and if possible the pace of them should be much more brutal and cruel. However, if those fail, it will be mainly because Greece's partners fail to understand that there are factors to be taken into consideration here that truly make Greece a unique case.

His account four years after the end of WW1:

&gt; ""354 politische Morde von rechts; Gesamtsühne: 90 Jahre, 2 Monate Einsperrung, 730 M. Geldstrafe und 1 lebenslängliche Haft""; dagegen: ""22 Morde von links; Gesamtsühne: 10 Erschießungen, 248 Jahre, 9 Monate Einsperrung, 3 lebenslängliche Zuchthausstrafen.""

354 political murders from the right, leading to:

1 life sentence, a sum of 90 years of prison sentences and 730Mark fines.

22 political murders from the left, leading to:

10 executions, 3 life sentences and a sum of 248 years of prison sentences.

There is probably more complete data and I imagine it got even more skewed over time as the right gained a stronger foothold.

Julius Gumbel had to emigrate to the USA during the third Reich. But already before he was not liked in Germany because he dared to voice the outrageous idea that half a generation dying in a war was not a honorable thing but disgraceful and stupid.

I can very well understand that the greeks are frustrated. Nobody likes to give up their wealth and I can certainly understand, that fear of economic ruin is widespread in greece.

But to give all the blame to another country, even comparing them with one of the most evil regimes in the history of mankind, this is outrageous!

Let me describe how the euro-crisis is seen from our perspective.
Germany has worked very hard to overcome the time since the reunification. German wages haven't risen much in the last 20 years ([source](http://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article6526662/Griechen-arbeiten-konkurrenzlos-teuer.html)).

On the other side it has been proven that greece did not report their financial problems when joining the eurozone. They lied to the other Euro-countries about this. Meanwhile the wages of the average greek worker rose every year at a much higher rate than the wages of the german workers. But wouldn't the state profit from the higher average income through more tax revenue? No! Greece is one of the countries with the most cases of tax evasion. And one of the coruptest countries in europe. ([sources in Norrskens post](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/qqcm0/when_in_doubt_call_them_nazis_ugly_stereotypes_of/c3znjji))

Now greece is screaming for help and who has to pay it? Germany of course. As the country with the biggest economy in the EU and in the euro-zone we have to pay for what people in greece fucked up! (sorry for the rude words)


Of course I don't blame every Greek for what is happening in his country. Not everybody in this country is a criminal or corrupt. There sure are a lot of greeks who are hard-working, tax-paying people, who are as enraged as I am, that now everything is going down the drain.

But to compare the germans with the nazis? That is just rude. Germany is helping Greece and this is how we get repayed? It's absolutely justified that german politicians are asking for change in greek politics and economy. Change is needed to build a stabilized and long-lasting economy. All those nazi-allegations are just a sign of fear and the refusal to accept what's necessary.

For the record, I'm a French lawyer, and I've been working pro bono for several French LGBTQ NGOs on these issues for the last 20 years; I'm currently the legal director of one such NGO.

I'm certainly incompetent for non-French legal systems, but regarding France, this table is abysmally wrong and uninformed which leads me to worry how wrong it is regarding other countries.

Two examples just to explain what I mean:

- column 1 is plain wrong: sexual orientation is clearly referred to in the anti-discrimination laws. (gender identity is also referred to, since a ruling of 2005, under the interpretation of the « genre réel ou supposé » clause in the discrimination laws)

- column 6 is wrong: legal gender change does not require surgery anymore; I can quote 3 cases from 2008 which haven't been appealed by the state and are thus an essential part of the current case law (a good tool in the French legal culture, but not binding)

- column 11 is wrong: the administrative rule against joint adoption by same sex couples has been declared unconstitutional 5 years ago.

Looking through the French line, I estimate that about half the columns are wrong.

I'm also worried by the fact that in most cases, one can't describe the current situation in such contrasted terms. Reality doesn't happen in black or white, but in many shades of grey.

I hate that kind of simplified message. If you feel concerned about those issues of essential fairness in our societies, don't spew useless and baseless propaganda!

They cannot be held accountable in the same way I cannot be held accountable for my own countries failures. This is especially troublesome given that the Greek governments not only lied to the EU and various other organizations, but they lied to their own people. There was no conspiracy among the 10 million + Greeks to deliberately hide or alter their financial woes.

I answered the comment of Tagami (above my forst post of course), quoted him, like this

&gt;Greece's corruption was facilitated mainly by Siemens and other Western Europe corporations, who found a blind man and led him to the cliff's edge. 

And then my links and my arguments were toward *his* statement, that *Greece's corruption was facilitated mainly by Siemens.*


*That* what was my original disagreement, and I provided links to respectable sources, to prove that the Greeks were mainly to blame, not the foreigners which, his post said. 


Then you started to argue with me claiming: 

&gt;The number from your first link does not address corruption. Furthermore, it sounds like bullshit because the only source everyone on the internet is citing for this information, is the same shitty CNN article that has no citations.

&gt;Your second link does not go counter to what the above commenter said. 


You are clearly disagreeing with me (you wrote more, but that is an excerpt) so, therefore I have, repeatedly asked you to provide me with links where I am proven wrong, and that most of the debacle that Greece is in, in because of the *Greeks*, not because of non-Greeks. You have, repeatedly failed to do so, the only thing you have said is that Siemen's is corrupt. I have never ever disputed that, I just do not think that they are the cause (together with other Western European companies)


&gt;I asked for a reliable source other than that CNN article,


I have provided you with several links to Greece's tax evasion and tax corruption, but *IF* you had actually bothered to read the article, you could have seen that it was from a *Greek* source, from 2008 (*before* all hell broke loose I might add, even though it probably wasn't fun then). Here, it is in the first paragraph.


&gt;More than 5 million Greeks did not pay income taxes for 2008, according to public documents released by the struggling nation's finance ministry.

No, you are very weird. The only thing you have is opinion, and when someone *proves* you wrong, you disagree and start to talk about something else. You do not like that people do not have the same *opinion* as you have - therefore the *facts* must be wrong. Please, start using facts!

true,Bezbojnicul,ROMA,Internetistan,"That's some great input, fact-wise, but I take issue with your tone. Unlike you, I am not a lawyer in any country, but a redditor who happened to find an interesting piece of information, and shared it. By not being a lawyer, I had no idea whether this was 100% accurate or not, but be assured, my intention was not to „spew useless and baseless propaganda”, and I resent you suggesting this was intentional. If you have issues with the factual accuracy of the map, take it up with [ILGA Europe](http://www.ilga-europe.org/) as they are the ones who made this.

PS. Reality does indeed come in many shades of grat, but when one wants to quantify it and compare it, one must find a means of simplifying the diverse issues that vary greatly from country to country (we do this in economics when comparing GDPs, for instance). Also calling it „black and white” is wrong, as it does not divide the continent into 2 colors (above and below 0), but, as with any abstract representation, it does have less „shades of gray” than reality.",0,1331451593,null,0,true,0,c3ztf5z,t3_qqmby,t1_c3ztf5z,t1_c3zp708,null,1428504378,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

1) It's really lovely. Great, reliable, FREQUENT public transport (I'm from Australia where public transport stops at midnight so it was AMAZING to be able to catch a tram to the airport at 4am), beautiful historical buildings, museums etc. It's not a massive city but there are plenty of places to explore - there is so much history behind the place. 

The only complaint I have is that the streets are mostly cobblestone, which really kills your feet if you're walking around all day. Invest in some nice sturdy boots/walking shoes.

2) Travel is simple. It's pretty much choose a destination, buy a train ticket, hop on a train and a few hours later you're there. I had a few friends wander off to the Czech Republic for a weekend, another friend went to France on a whim, just because they felt like it, so if you have a week to spare then yes it's definitely feasible.
