Das Schweizer Bankgeheimnis gilt für Schweizer und schweizer Banken.
Deutschland kann ja auch keine Holländer für den Drogenkonsum in ihrem Land belangen. Und genauso verhält es sich mit Wirtschaftsspionage und Datenschutz. Das sind Straften in der Schweiz, aber nicht für und in Deutschland. Ist ja nicht so, dass ein Deutscher nach Basel fährt und da in eine Bank eindringt und Daten klaut, sondern dass ein Schweizer die Linie der Schweiz durchzieht und zu erst an sich denkt und die CDs in Deutschland an Deutsche verkauft.
So wie die Schweiz Steuerbetrug und Geldwäsche im großen Stil betreibt, muss sie sich bei der Moral doch nicht wundern, wenn andere Schweizer sich auch über die Moral hinwegsetzen und die Daten in Deutschland (oder übrigens auch in Österreich,Italien,USA usw.) verkauft.
Ein Vorschlag zu Güte: wir trennen uns! Wir beenden Schengen, es gibt eine Grenze mit Zoll zwischen Schweiz und Deutschland. So kann der deutsche Zoll wieder alle die tonnenweise Bargeld rüberschleppen kontrollieren und die Schweiz kann ihr Ding mit Geldwäsche machen.
Österreich, Italien, Frankreich und die USA haben auch bereits diverse Klagen gegen die Schweiz geführt und einige gewonnen.
Besonders vor den USA hat die Schweiz ja schon immer gekuscht, weil sonst der Zugang zu SWIFT und anderen geldwäscherelevanten Schnittstellen abhanden gekommen wäre.

Europa ist eine Interessenzusammenschluß und keine Liebesbeziehung. Sag mir welches Intersse Deutschland, Frankreich, Österrreich, Italien usw. noch haben könnten mit der Schweiz in einem Club zu sein?
Die Verluste für Deutschland beziffern sich jedes Jahr auf Milliarden - das ist ja wohl unbestritten. Vorteile sind vielleicht das Geld was man Spart weil man keine Grenze betreiben muss. Die Arbeitslosen die da in der Pflege/Medizin einen Job gefunden haben sind soviel Vorteil wie es ein Nachteil ist, dass deutsche Ärzte in der Schweiz und nicht in der deutschen Provinz arbeiten.

Warum also sollten die anderen europäischen Ländern partnerschaftlich mit der Schweiz umgehen? Ich hätt da gerne mal ein paar gute Gründe...oder zumindest soviele, dass es die Milliarden Steuerverluste kompensiert.

Der bisher in Deutschland nicht ratifizierte Ausgleichsvertrag sieht weniger Rückzahlungen aus den von der Schweiz gedeckten Verbrechen vor, als allein NRW dieses Jahr bereits aus CD ankäufen generiert hat.

Sinn has the opinion that the current crisis did not start in 2008, but before that, because the countries failing today have traditionally had a trade deficit. When private capital fled these countries between '08 and '10, the ECB allowed them to take credits at the Bundesbank, over 300 billion to this date, and pay it over the TARGET system. This effectively was a bailout before the bailout discussed now, which - and that is even worse - was granted without parliamentary support and thus unconstitutionally. 

Sinn sees the bailout as a continuation of these - unsuccessful - practices and notices how this will eventually bleed out the German economy, leading to a more catastrophic crash of the Euro than the one we are risking at this moment.

The illegal nature of the proceeds of crime renders the laundering activity necessary in order to make the wealth appear as if it was derived by legitimate means. Thus, money laundering contributes to  the process of unfair reallocation of wealth from the good to the bad by rendering detection extremely difficult and allowing criminals to enjoy the fruits of their crimes undisturbed. As MacKrell (1997, p. 3) points out, “money laundering  helps make crime worthwhile. It helps give legitimacy and even respectability to some of the most unworthy in society. It gives economic power to criminals and takes it from the law abiding tax payer” (see also Camdessus 1998, Walker 1995). That is to say, as a result of money laundering, crime pays off. 
 
&gt; This **direct effect of money laundering**, the losses to the victims of crime and the gains to the perpetrators of crime are also mentioned by the IMF  (Camdessus 1998, p. 2) and by AUSTRAC (the Australian FATF organization, see Walker (1995). The costs and gains of money laundering have been estimated by Walker (1992) in a survey for Australia. 

And the list goes on with the other 24 identified effects.

&gt; The rest of these are almost entirely things which may be positive or negative.

Well, rape could be a positive thing to the rapist.

Historically Muslims and Christians were at each others' throats for centuries with accusations on both sides that the others were infidels and heretics. A whole series of medieval wars between the sides in the Iberian Peninsula, Middle East and Balkans did little to improve matters.  

Do Muslims accept the position of Jesus as the Son of God? No, and this is historically unacceptable to Christianity in the same way that Christian disregard for the role of Mohammed is unacceptable to Islam. The situation then arises of two religions tending towards disparity but also competing for hearts and minds- as both are aggressively expansionist in terms of seeking converts and adherents- in close geographical proximity. In such a situation it's inconceivable to many followers that the competing religion could worship the same deity. 

Whether this is a position that would have been promoted if the Ottoman and Holy Roman Empires hadn't been waging war with each other for so long is another question.

&gt;The real problem with Sicily (and most other southern Italian regions, Basilicata excluded) is that the government has never done anything to contain its *huge* expenses when it comes to administration: while it's true that it's the largest region, it isn't the most popolous, and yet it spends more on bureaucracy (and has way more public personnel) than any other big region, like Lombardia and Veneto. Not to mention the fact that its autonomous status makes it possible for the Sicilian administration to collect taxes and use that money 100% inside Sicily, whereas any other region (including the other 4 autonomous regions) has to redirect a good % of the taxes collected to Rome, for national use. Which is to say, Sicily is close to default even though it only *receives* money from Rome, without giving anything back! Granted, this problem has deeper roots (mafia and [trasformismo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trasformismo), to begin with) and finding a lasting and radical solution will necessitate a great deal of time and a real effort from Italy as a whole (*Lega Nord*'s secessionist aspirations won't be of any help, I'm afraid), but Monti's cuts-only agenda won't help either: what Italy needs is reforms that will promote economic growth equally in the South and North.

You wouldn't be allowed into the party if you were very religious. That was the biggest suppression because party members were the executives in anything. Most religious people kept it to themselves and did no parade it like the psychopathic schizophrenic cunts that are everywhere in a democracy.

I mean, you want me to pay just under a fixed €250 per month right off the bat whether or not I'm making any money at all? I'm expected to collect VAT, which you have now raised from 16% to 21% in just two years, on top of my invoices, and not only do you expect me, as a small, solitary business of one to somehow be able to set that money aside from my personal economy of ever varying and now dwindling earnings, but I am expected to advance payment of it before myself receiving payment for the invoices it applies to (since nearly all of my clients pay at 60-90 days if they manage to pay on time and on occasion don't pay at all)? And now you are raising the personal income tax my clients withhold from said invoices from 15% to 19%?

Let's see. That means that if in a given month the work invoiced comes to €2000 (which it by no means always or even usually does), the moneys I am expected to pay away immediately just for being in business for myself come to:

- Just being a registered freelancer: ~€250
- 2000 * .21 IVA: €420
- 2000 * .19 IRPF: €380

**Total:** €1050

WOW. WOW. To be a freelancer invoicing €2000 a month I have to pay €1050 a month? Before other business expenses and living expenses are considered at all?

The majority of these retirees all bring money to a region that would otherwise (like Benidorm) still be a fishing village. The vast majority of local income comes from them. Most of the Spanish coast has accepted this for decades, precisely for this reason - it's a bit daft to become all nationalistic about people without whom the region wouldn't exist. And Al Jazeera don't seem to have noticed that you can walk into any of these areas and find groups that only speak Dutch, German...these people have created a lot of the areas they live in, and their money dictates how much influence they have compared to economic migrants. None of this is new, and it certainly isn't just about the English. In fact, the number of English has gone down since the Euro crash (certainly around Alicante), as their money isn't worth as much any more; Dutch/ Germans don't have this problem.

It just gets sillier as it goes along - the article is blatantly trying to create a controversy where there isn't one. The presenter, for example, cites a local mayor as 'having to adapt to her northern invaders', as if these investors (which is what they actually are) have just popped out of nowhere. It's journalism channelling naivety to generate shock - I doubled-checked to make sure the presenter wasn't Chris Morris. It's laughable.

He then notes a local paper that 'has had to be produced in their native language' - again, presenting it as an 'issue' when actually, the Costa Blanca News (which is all in English) has been around since 1970. And you can get German and Dutch newspapers in any Pryca too - but I guess that wouldn't make it all so sensationalist.

Then we're exposed to the shock that local schools are having to speak English because of the number of foreign pupils - again, expressed as if this has only happened recently. Or that all Spanish generally learn English as a second language anyway.

If you can't see the difference between economic migrants moving to your country in order to start earning money, and economic migrants that bring lots of money with them, you're really just looking for an excuse. And that's before we address Spain currently needing all the money it can get...

The Catholic Church were also protected.  A small number of religious rebels were persecuted for political reasons, but that's about it. Even the famous Communist leaders were buried with Christian rites. 

The reason why the map is dark blue in Romania has many factors:  the long tradition of orthodox Christianity, especially during feudalism and after, which made it deeply ingrained in the rural culture; the general and persistent ignorance and lack of education, often promoted in many ways by local authorities (including the Church itself, which always was very regressive); and a misconception about religiosity.

While officially there are few atheists in Romania, most believers are actually really poor at their religion, similar to *cafeteria Catholics* or have very lazy beliefs (they just take it as truth and that's that), so they don't act like Christians (which is mostly good), they don't talk like Christians, they don't go to Church or confession regularly, they don't give money often (the State supports all cults proportionally, so the OC gets most of the capital)...  they just *declare* themselves a ""Christian"" in polls and the       census, because they think that's what they're supposed to do since their parents were like that and they were *raised Christian*. 

For the most recent referendum there were some campaigns to get these people to come clean and admit they're not really religious, but the results are still unclear as the national census data still has not been processed/published.

Je pense - mais apparemment j'ai tort - qu'on peut appliquer un schéma """"""anti malthusien"""""" à la situation post 45 : évolution géométrique des ressources disponibles ( ou plutôt de la production ) et évolution arithmétique de la population ( ou plutôt de la demande ) [en fait l'évolution de la population est géométrique mais celle de la production lui est supérieure et de plus en plus]

Résultat, effectivement dans un premier temps (trente glorieuses) l'augmentation de la production/productivité ne génère pas de chômage de masse; la demande étant supérieure ou au moins égale à la production ( via reconstruction, augmentation du niveau de vie, apparition de nouveaux besoins [essor du tourisme, informatique, automobile, culture de masse...] ). Mais au bout d'un moment, la demande n'augmente plus aussi vite que la production: la production s'ajuste donc à la demande d'où chômage, puisque une personne produit plus que ce qu'elle consomme.

L'automobile est un assez bon exemple: on a eu une augmentation de la production par personne qui a permis de répondre à la demande au Nord, puis chez les émergents; maintenant que la demande n'augmente plus si vite ( le Nord a un marché atone ), il y a donc une trop forte production de voiture: la dite production diminue pour revenir à un niveau précédent. Or, grâce aux gains de productivité par personne, on a besoin de beaucoup moins d'employés pour atteindre cette production; d'où chômage de masse.

I'm pretty sure that I will leave Poland, maybe not if I'll be able to get a nice job after college, but I'm learning languages and I'm not really patriotic so probably it's gonna be the case. Young people who want to start a businnes have hard time (though some colleges, like AGH, can help You a little bit with starting a business) - lots of payments.

Other thing that I don't like is the prize of books. It's like 40/50zł for new books.

My point of view is probably biased and I'm not educated in economics, but it's how I see things. I don't really see the economic growth too in standard live (prizes are going up, payment is staying the same - at least for my parents)",0,1342615835,null,0,1342616247,0,c5fqfyr,t3_wlqzh,t1_c5fqfyr,t3_wlqzh,null,1429406187,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

1)Government Deficit. The German government has consistently run a smallish deficit and is indeed on course to completely eliminate the said deficit. In Greece et all the size of the deficit is larger, and will take longer to pay down. In effect Germany can have a large debt as it is creditable that they will be able to begin earning money to pay it off.

2)Government Creditably. The German government has a long history of fiscal creditably, both as they have tended to run smaller deficits and they are perceived as 'trustworthy'. They have a long history of paying their debts in full. Greece and Italy on the other-hand have a history of either explicitness defaulting on their debts (by not paying) or implicitly defaulting (running high levels of inflation to reduce the real cost). 

3)Size of the economy. Germany has a far larger economy then the other states, which is also performing significantly better. As this is the case they can raise a larger sum of money though taxation and have a larger stock of wealth to be able to draw upon to pay down debt. They are therefore trusted to have higher debt - think how a bank would be more willing to lend to bank manager then a cashier. 

Simply put people trust the Germans to pay back the debt, they are more able to pay and they are not borrowing as much money that will be needed to pay back. ",0,1342616960,null,0,false,0,c5fqmd7,t3_wr8s0,t1_c5fqmd7,t3_wr8s0,null,1429406284,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

A lot of people will identify as religious on surveys because their family are, or because they were baptised or for even the smallest niggling belief in some sort of supernatural force (even if they should really identify as agnostic in that case).

The church also has a reasonable influence in the Irish state, there's more than a couple of laws etc. on the books that indicate a reasonable support for religion amongst the populace.

true,Carnelov,null,null,"Vous oubliez les reports dans la demande et la reconfiguration des secteurs et systèmes productifs en mutation.
Autrefois, une immense majorité des citoyens de notre pays étaient directement liés à des activités agricoles ou de transformation de produits agricoles. Ce n'est plus le cas. Une toute petite minorité de la population peut désormais nourrir l'immense majorité des citoyens d'un pays développé. 

En fait, vous avez l'impression que ce qui a déjà fonctionné ne peut plus fonctionner. Alors que vous parlez de la culture de masse (qui représente une part croissante des productions de nos pays), l'informatique (idem), le tourisme (idem -et qui devrait s'accroître également-).

Mais pour donner un peu plus mon avis personnel...
Selon moi, la question de l'emploi n'est pas une bonne question. Le paradigme est complètement biaisé, vu que l'on considère le Travail (avec un grand T : celui qui apporte santé, bonheur et assaini l'Homme !) comme l'Alpha et l'Omega de politiques publiques.
Alors que la question de la répartition de la valeur ajoutée est bien plus centrale. Celle de la diffusion de biens et services. Des inégalités. De la structure productive du pays.

Par exemple, en France, la structure de notre population active diffère profondément d'autres pays. Est-ce bien ou mal ? Nous avons une population parmi les plus productives du monde d'un côté, et de l'autre une importante population vivant des transferts directs et/ou indirects de ces productifs. A noter qu'on ne peut considérer qu'il s'agit de ""parasites"", hein ; c'est juste que le marché de l'emploi est particulièrement sélectif et que nos postes de travail impliquent de très fortes charges en termes de productivité. C'est ce qui ressort des statistiques relatives à cette dernière.
Est-ce qu'on devrait considérer tous ceux pour qui le travail n'est plus nécessaire (enfants, retraités...) comme d'affreux parasites ? Non. Autrefois, ces gens-là travaillaient. Désormais, nous pensons pour des raisons pratiques (un jeune bien formé est plus productif après) ou humaines qu'on peut les laisser peinards. D'autres pays ne pensent pas comme nous. D'autres vont aussi plus loin et connaissent des systèmes de solidarité plus intensifs.
Vous me dites, dans votre raisonnement, qu'il y aura un jour, peut-être, une toute petite partie de la population qui pourra produire suffisamment pour l'ensemble des citoyens ? Tant mieux. 

On pourrait aussi se demander pourquoi des pays développés -tiens, comme tous ceux investissant lourdement dans l'innovation- s'en sortent mieux que nous. C'est étonnant, non ? Pourquoi est-ce qu'on entend pas parler de chômage de masse dans des pays tels que la Suède (""mais c'est tout petit ! Rien de comparable !"") ou l'Allemagne (""mais c'est super grand ! Rien de comparable !"", huhuhu) ? Sont-ils condamnés à voir leur population gagné par un chômage massif au fil du temps ? S'ils continuent sur la même voie, en investissant dans le capital humain, en se spécialisant, en menant des efforts de recherche, en offrant des opportunités aux entrepreneurs, il ne me semble pas...

Votre raisonnement tient lorsqu'on imagine qu'il n'existe qu'un seul secteur industriel au monde (l'automobile).

I have to say I was very encouraged by a recent news piece about how only half of the kids in the capital area are getting baptized anymore, maybe that's the one you've read as well. Not that getting baptized matters that much here, especially if we pass the 'ethics and world religions for all instead of teaching everyone their own religion' -reform that's being planned. That could cut the cultural christianity we have pretty efficiently if people actually learn something about the other religions around the world, more than just a couple of hours in secondary school.

Atheism doesn't need to be enforced, because it's based on the proposition that every thinking person when looking at the scientific facts realizes that no gods are necessary and there's no evidence for any. After that if you still feel like believing in a deity, well that's your own business (and right). Other people, however, have the right to think it's foolish of you to believe in something that you can present no evidence for.

Making atheism mandatory as opposed to a conclusion everyone freely comes to, is an oxymoron. The essence of atheism is 'I find no evidence, therefore I will act as if this doesn't exist, until proven otherwise.' You can't ever give positive evidence for it.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Ce n'est plus le cas. Une toute petite minorité de la population peut désormais nourrir l'immense majorité des citoyens d'un pays développé. 

C'est exactement l'idée que j'ai : les gains de productivité permettent de diminuer le nombre de personnes requises pour subvenir au besoin de l'ensemble. Le problème - je pense - c'est que la demande n'est pas illimitée: et donc comme tous les secteurs ont ces gains de productivité, on a au final avec Z personnes qui surviennent aux besoins de X personnes (Z&lt;X). A terme, dès que la demande est satisfaite de façon maximale, on aura X-Z personnes au chômage.

Oui, de nouveaux besoins apparaissent, mais est ce suffisant? et de nouveaux besoins peuvent ils apparaitre de manière illimitée? 

&gt;On pourrait aussi se demander pourquoi des pays développés [...] il ne me semble pas...

Mais le travail est divisé mondialement : pour reprendre mon propos de trois lignes plus haut, les Z personnes qui sont suffisantes à produire pour les autres peuvent très bien se retrouver dans un certain nombre de pays - qui grâce à la recherche, et autres facteurs - resteront les plus compétitifs et donc ceux qui produisent. Il y a à terme chômage, pas forcément réparti équitablement entre les pays.

La population mondiale augmente dans des pays qui produisent moins de richesses par habitant, mais qui consomme de plus en plus:
cela augmente très largement la demande en augmente de manière modérée la production; mais dès lors qu'il y a développement, à (long) terme, tous les habitants seront capables de générer plus de richesses que leurs besoins, et là, soit chômage, soit réduction de la productivité (en faveur de l’environnement, des lois du travail, etc).

&gt;Vous me dites, dans votre raisonnement, qu'il y aura un jour, peut-être, une toute petite partie de la population qui pourra produire suffisamment pour l'ensemble des citoyens ? Tant mieux. 

C'est déjà le cas dans le secteur primaire, plus ou moins dans le secteur secondaire: alors pourquoi pas aussi dans le secteur tertiaire?



La question de l'emploi reste cruciale il me semble, parce que nous (France) n'arrivons pas à ""gagner la bataille de la production"": il paraît évident que la France ne produit pas assez de richesses pour subvenir aux besoins de tous dans la situation actuelle (pauvreté, précarité ...)

 Il y a Z' personnes qui travaillent; soit Z'&lt;Z , il faut faire en sorte d'augmenter ce nombre Z' pour permettre de produire suffisamment de richesses pour subvenir aux besoins de la population X; soit Z'≥Z , alors la France ne produit pas assez de richesses pour satisfaire les besoins de tous uniquement parce qu'elle distribue mal/pas assez ses richesses, là pas besoin de politique pour l'emploi mais une politique pour la répartition.

De plus, on peut aussi chercher une forme d'égalité: tous le monde produit moins, de telle sorte que le Z augmente telle que les X-Z personnes soient celles qui ne doivent pas travailler (personnes âgées, enfants, etc): on répartit l'effort de manière juste. Bon après, en pratique ça ne marche pas super bien (35h), à cause de nombreux facteurs dont je dois connaître moins de la moitié.

Ensuite, travailler est un droit ( *Toute personne a droit au travail, au libre choix de son travail, à des conditions équitables et satisfaisantes de travail et à la protection contre le chômage.* , article 23 de la déclaration universelle des droits de l'Homme !); plus Z est faible, plus la protection contre le chômage est difficile et le droit au travail compliqué à assurer.

Enfin, le travail est la meilleure des polices; on va tout de même pas les gens laisser développer leur raison**؟**

What the fuck has that got to do with what I claimed?  My claim was that the numbers of retirees in the South of Spain had very little effect on the property market which was overwhelmingly inflated by domestic demand for property caused by a credit boom.  Nobody disputes the Spanish housing market is in a mess.  What we dispute is whether stemming the numbers of Northern European retirees, who if anything are propping up the market in the locales in which they settle, will have any sort of effect. 

&gt; If is you who decided to make it personal about lower middle classes.

No, I'm just familiar with the sort of ""dog whistle terms"" middle class bigots use.  When others go on holiday, the destination is ""whoring itself out"".  Naturally when you go on holiday it's a mutually beneficial exchange of goods for services, with both parties on an equal footing.  Colour me unimpressed with your claims to innocence.

Abgesehen davon spielt auch das Gerechtigkeitsempfinden der Gesellschaft eine sehr große Rolle.

Hinzu kommt, dass eine Ungleichheit zwischenmenschliches Handeln beeinflusst. Je egalitärer eine Gesellschaft ist, desto eher sind Individuen bereit einander zu trauen.

In Poland church was traditionaly the only institution that supported independence - Poland lost independence in 1795, to orthodox Russia and protestant Prussia (later Germany). There were also mostly catholic Habsburgs occupying southern Poland, but they were much less oppresive, and allowed some autonoym, when Germans and Russians were repressing Polish language and culture. So for over 100 years (to 1918) Poles who wanted to regain independence were using catholic symbolism (Poland as the messiah of countries, etc, etc). It's a big part of Polish culture to this day.

The Poland regained indpendence, and the biggest danger was communist(atheist) Russia and Nazi(pagan? atheist? catholic?) Germany. And then there was 50 years of USSR (atheist) occupation. So again - Poles who wanted independence kept close to church, as it was the only institution that was independend of totalitarian government.

Since the fall of the the communism here (1989) catholic church has been involved in politics too much (because most current politicians came from oppositionists during communism, and they worked with church then). So now people have enough of church influence on politic, and there's no immediate danger to Polish independence, so Poles are becoming less and less religious quickly.

Czechs, on the other hand, had their own protestant faith (Hussitism), and were beaten to submission to stop beliving in it. Then catholic empire occupie them and tried to force faith, and then when communism came, nobody had problems with atheism (at least that's how I see it from here, I'm not a Czech).

The second aspect (I read it somewhere), was the fact that there are two competing Bulgarian Orthodox Churches.

Now for the information. If you decide not to listen to my free and friendly advice, what you need in Spain is a gestor, a person that knows about rules and regulations  and people (very important still) around here and that can make sure you will get all the neccessary paper work in hands. Next to that I advice you to also hire a avogado, a lawyer. Just to make sure everything really is in order.

A gestor, and it depends a bit on how much work you let him or her do, will normally cost you in between 50 and 75 euros a month to help you with your papers, that is except if there is some more to take care of, but it is all very reasonable. A lawyer will cost you more but you need them less. 

Learn spanish! You need to have your social hygiene diploma in order to be able to work with food but you may also hire a person to do that for you. Did I mention that you should really learn Spanis.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"At first I thought you had these two as electives in high school, but after I used Google, I learned that what you were talking about was British undergraduate degree classifications. My first tip is, when somebody ask what degree you have, first specify do you have Bachelor or Master degree, then mention that you have first class honors.

That said, depending on your work experience, you might want to start browsing web pages of big consulting firms and then if not lucky look up small to medium sized consulting firms. Besides you having a degree, your biggest asset is that you are American and you know American culture, and you can be helpful asset when dealing or exporting to US. Especially if you have sales/marketing friendly personality then this could be your angel of attack to get that job from a European company. Of course if you have another personality, you need to think again on what value you could provide for a European firm.

Another tip that comes to my mind is that you should create a CV in a standard format, for example use [Europass](http://europass.cedefop.europa.eu/en/home) to generate and automatically format it. Because it Europass, you will be probably forgiven that your CV in another format than what is locally expected. Another tip is that you need to have a Linkedin profile, so that you have an online presence.

That said, I think you have real possibility to get a job from Europe. Just remember that getting a job is a mix of right kind of marketing, and repetition, you might to have apply for hundreds of firms online to get few emails back, or make endless amounts of calls to HR departments on are they interested on your kind of guys...

""Oui, de nouveaux besoins apparaissent, mais est ce suffisant? et de nouveaux besoins peuvent ils apparaitre de manière illimitée?""

* Oui.
C'est quasiment exponentiel.
Nous n'avons pas un besoin infini de voitures, par exemple, je suis d'accord. Mais le système économique français a bien survécu à cette étrange et inexplicable atteinte d'un taux de pénétration de marché quasi-maximal pour quelque chose comme le lave-linge, par exemple. :)

Pour la suite et pour ce passage, je le répète : les besoins évoluent, s'accroissent, tandis que le niveau d'équipement et le ""contentement des besoins initiaux"" également.

* Tu me parles de pauvreté et de nourriture : mais oui, si nous le voulions réellement, nous pourrions répartir différemment les richesses du pays afin que chacun ait un toit, à manger, etc. Si tu veux un ordre de grandeur, par exemple, le RSA coûte environ sept milliards d'euros par an. 
(Source : http://blogs.lesechos.fr/echosdataviz/le-fonctionnement-du-rsa-et-son-a5951.html)
Soit environ 0,35% de tout ce qui a été produit, vendu ou consommé en France en 2011 (notre PIB était alors légèrement inférieur à 2000 milliards, en gros).
http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Produit_int%C3%A9rieur_brut_de_la_France

C'est pourquoi la question du partage de la valeur ajoutée est si centrale. C'est pourquoi on la pose, directement ou non, à chaque exercice budgétaire, lorsqu'une usine ferme ou même lorsqu'on débute en science économique (et qu'on se tape d'interminables cours en compta nationale).

* Sur le travail, tu sais, cette transition est déjà amorcée depuis longtemps. 
A ce niveau, pourquoi un individu ne serait pas plus heureux en travaillant moins, voire ne plus travaillant du tout, et en ayant ses besoins tout de même assurés par le jeu des échanges internationaux et locaux ?

Ah. Mais c'est déjà le cas. Suis-je bête.
Penses-tu réellement qu'une majorité de la population planétaire pourrait vivre comme elle le fait si les échanges transnationaux, l'innovation technologique, la coopération entre pays, n'étaient pas aussi intenses ? Penses-tu que tu pourrais te nourrir, t'habiller, taper sur un clavier, avoir tes soirées de libre (j'imagine ? je ne me prononce pas plus que cela), ne pas travailler lorsque tu étais enfant, etc. sans cela ?

C'est le jeu du développement économique. C'est d'ailleurs à cela qu'aspirent les pays émergents.

Le travail pour le travail, c'est une forme d'aliénation malsaine. Non, je ne crois pas que le ""travail rend libre"". 

La question de la perte du travail par la technologie et l'ouverture des pays, on se la pose depuis longtemps, hein. Nos pays étaient autant, sinon plus ouverts juste avant la crise de 1929. Ils étaient d'ailleurs bien plus spécialisés.

Le problème de la France, actuellement, c'est de vouloir fonctionner comme un pays sur-développé (mode Allemagne, Suède, etc.), avec un système productif et économique qui commence à dater et n'innove plus. On peut trouver les causes du chômage dans 1001 sources avant de penser à la mondialisation (sauf si l'on veut vraiment se la jouer à la Montebourg : il suffit de décréter que ""cela n'est pas acceptable"" !) ou même au développement technologique...
...alors que ce sont justement ces deux dynamiques qui profitent le plus à de nombreux pays : ceux en voie de développement comme ceux très développés.

Lorsque tu vois les pays qui ne s'en sortent pas, actuellement, il ne faut pas aller chercher bien loin. Les Etats-Unis s'effondrent avec lenteur après avoir mené deux guerres à l'autre bout du monde qui leur a coûté un fric phénoménal, en ayant vidé leur économie nationale. Il leur reste l'innovation et le prestige, mais ils ont perdu leur leadership. La Grèce et l'Espagne ont fait n'importe quoi avec leur économie. 
La France n'arrive plus à innover en-dehors de superstructures étatiques remplies de technocrates et de bureaucrates, et cela fait des décennies qu'on fait comprendre à sa jeunesse que le Must du Must tient dans la carrière de manager ; pas ingénieur, pas inventeur, pas docteur en sciences dures, pas innovateur, pas entrepreneur... mais bien MANAGER. Quelle est l'école la plus prestigieuse en France ? Une école destinée à former l'élite de l'administration. Quelles sont les plus grosses fortunes en France ? Des familles et des technocrates ayant pantouflé du public au privé. Quelles sont les entreprises du CAC 40 en France ? Une bonne majorité sont directement ou indirectement liées à l'Etat.

Et Montebourg s'étonne, ainsi que de nombreuses personnes, qu'on ait besoin de ""redressement productif"" ? Ah. 
Je crois que c'est ce qu'il y a de plus basique en macroéconomie et théorie de la croissance ; la croissance à long terme se trouve dans l'investissement dans le capital humain et l'innovation. La croissance trouve ses sources également dans un climat légal et structurel stable (interventionniste ou pas, d'ailleurs... voir les pays du nord qui s'en sortent très bien avec un poids de l'Etat imposant !), un investissement dans les infrastructures du pays, un bon renouvellement de l'élite, une population éduquée, etc.

Sérieusement, accuser la mondialisation à l'heure actuelle, c'est vraiment n'importe quoi. Qu'on accuse l'UE (qui est autre chose), par exemple, j'arrive à comprendre. Mais ""la mondialisation"", les mouvements d'entreprises étrangères et libres, etc. ça me semble délirant.

La dernière de Montebourg : il va taper du poing sur la table face à Rio Tinto. Pour information, le marché du pétrole est moins concentré que celui du fer. Rio Tinto est l'une des trois entreprises s'occupant du minerai de fer dans le monde. En comparaison, Arcelor-Mittal n'a pas une position dominante dans l'acier. Et Montebourg parle d'expropriation éventuelle, de leur parler ""assez fermement"", etc.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"Careful, this is *external debt*, that is, what the public and private sector, the households, businesses and banks owe to foreign lenders. It's not at all the same as the debt level in general. If a German bank lends a euro to a Dutch business, and a Dutch bank lends a euro to a German customer, both countries' external debt increases by one euro, even though the net position (what the country owes minus what it is owed by others) doesn't change. You can take it as a measure of international connectedness, if you will. The UK has twice Germany's foreign debt, for example, because London is such a huge international banking hub.

Germany still has high public debt (what the federal, state and municipal governments owe to lenders, domestic and foreign alike), higher than Spain's even relative to the size of the economy. But as others have pointed out, it's less about the actual level of debt than it is about how much faith investors have that they will eventually get repaid.  
Spain has overall lower public debt, but it has high private debt and a large public deficit, i.e., the public debt raises quickly. The public deficit is high due to lower tax revenue in the crisis and high crisis related cost for the government's unemployment payments. What's worse, construction used to be an important sector and it's unlikely to ever return to its former size. The question is now, will other sectors in the Spanish economy be able to make up for what has been lost in the construction sector, how long will it take, and will the Spanish government run out of money before this has been accomplished? 

The problem feeds itself, in a way. Governments finance their debt by auctioning off bonds. Depending on the maturity date of the bond, it will have to be repaid in six months, a year, two years, and so on. Germany even sells 30-year bonds, which is rare. After that date, the bonds need to be replaced, i.e., governments have to constantly roll over their debt and sell bonds worth much more than only their deficit.  
Now, would you rather buy a ten-year-bond from Germany or from Spain? What about a two-year bond? Six months? If you were to buy one from Spain, you'd probably want to earn higher interests with it, because you'd perceive it as more risky. You can be fairly confident that Spain won't go bankrupt within the next half year, so you might take the six month one for less interest than the ten year one. With the two year one, you could already have doubts, because even though  Spain might still have a lower debt than Germany by then, the question is whether the Spanish government will find somebody who will lend them money to repay you with. It's the same with Germany -- who knows what the economy will be like in 30 years, you'd surely want to earn more if you tied your money to the German government for that long. The longer the duration, the higher the interest rate.  
So, Spain has to pay a higher interest rate on its debt than Germany because its long term prospects are more in doubt, not only because of the debt level or the deficit itself. That, in turn, costs the government more money to service its debt, which increases the deficit and therefore the overall debt, which in turn makes the long term prospect more insecure and leads to higher interest rates, which takes us back to the beginning of this vicious circle.

true,dumnezero,ROMA,Romania,"Yep. The Romanian territories were the last in the region to give up on feudalism and slavery, after and because of the 1848 movement. The Orthodox Church was the last institution to give up slaves (gypsies, rroma), while the region slowly, and I emphasize **slowly**, got out of the feudal era. We're about 50-100 years behind Europe culturally.

You mention the Serbs; all I can say is that the Orthodox Church imposed the use of the old slavic/slavon  language, and as it had so much wealth, it also had the means for education, which meant that they had a great deal of power over the intelligence of the society. The first schools were started by them so they could train clerks and smarter priests to work in the government and church bureaucracy. 

I mention the above because... well... Romanians don't speak Slavonic. We have many words from it, but it's a small influence; the alphabet is Latin and so is most of the language, but the religious authorities had a problem with Latin, since it was a Catholic thing. Which resulted in a highly ignorant population who couldn't tap the culture of the Renascence because of the lack of Latin training and books,  while also being stuck with stuff written in the Cyrillic alphabet, in old slavonic, which was an elitist language here, and  even the elites knew little. Often priests were forced to use slavonic in rituals, which was funny because they didn't know it, so they ended up murmuring it by ear, which is how we end up with the monotonous tone of rites you can find today every sunday in Romanian churches. When that murmuring/mumbling thing happened, it was called ""boscorodi""... there's actually a word for it.

My point is that Romanians were stuck in a large and dissipated area with few connections, with ignorant folk, ignorant rulers and doubly ignorant and anti-intellectual clergy.

Je me rappelais surtout du poids de Rio Tinto pour avoir rédigé une petite étude, un jour, sur Arcelor-Mittal. Tout le monde était effrayé par le poids de ce super-groupe et l'incapacité des Etats à discuter d'égal à égal avec une telle entreprise. Pour rappel, l'acquisition Arcelor-Mittal, ça avait été l'ancien petit groupe indien devenu super-groupe mondialisé qui absorbait le super-groupe occidental. C'était une belle période de racisme économique ; l'une des premières fois qu'on se rendait compte que les entreprises réactives du Sud pouvaient bouffer nos vieux conglomérats du Nord.
Dans mon étude, je m'intéressais rapido à la concentration du marché des fournisseurs. Je crois qu'à l'époque, Arcelor et Mittal, à eux deux, devaient faire 10% du marché de l'acier. Quelque chose comme ça (fast-checking sur Wikipédia : c'est environ ça, apparemment).
Rio Tinto, un tiers du marché du minerai de fer. Le poids et la puissance de ce truc, en fait, lorsqu'on y pense, c'est hallucinant.

C'est pourquoi je vois mal Montebourg mener une quelconque action contre eux. Je veux dire : une véritable action.
Montebourg, ça reste l'un des dobermans de Hollande.
Hollande, le mec qui se couche devant Areva à la suite d'un coup de fil, alors qu'il n'est même pas Président, qu'un accord EE-LV vient juste d'être signé, et qu'Areva est possédé par l'Etat. C'est chaud, lorsque ton futur salarié t'engueule au téléphone et que tu dois baisser ton pantalon.
Alors lorsque c'est encore plus gros, étranger, et habitué à se battre sur des terrains bien plus imposants, ça rigole... 

Pour le Must du Must : j'ai moi-même bossé dans les RH durant une courte période. On y trouve de tout, mais surtout : énormément de fric qui tombe grâce aux obligations des entreprises de revitaliser, réindustrialiser, coacher, accompagner, former, etc.
C'est juste une énorme manne de fric qui ne sert à pas grand' chose sauf à dire qu'on-a-tout-tenté-pour-cette-usine/ces salariés/ce site productif/cette usine. Même chose pour le marché de la formation, particulièrement vaste, baroque et délirant.

Le plus drôle est que cela fait effectivement office de Must du Must chez les nouveaux cadres parisiens, avec la finance, la comm', etc. Les RH trouve sa place dans les secteurs qui font très bien, qui rapportent beaucoup, mais qui ne servent à pas grand' chose au final, en termes productifs pour la croissance de long terme du pays.

Ce que je trouve triste, c'est qu'il faut bien être conscient que ce sont bien les classes bourgeoises qui fournissent généralement les ""leaders"" du pays, en termes d'élites politiques, économiques, intellectuelles, etc. Faut pas se leurrer ; la reproduction sociale existe, et elle est très forte en France. Elle se renforce, je crois, d'ailleurs, en raison de la crise.
On peut être d'accord ou non, apprécier ou non, mais voilà : ce que devient la génération-fille d'une élite bourgeoise permet généralement de savoir ce que va devenir le pays, en termes productifs et politique.
Je m'inquiète donc lorsque je constate le poids assez phénoménal, l'attractivité extraordinaire, des écoles de commerce, de Science Po, et de l'ENA ; en comparaison des écoles d'ingénieurs, des doctorats en sciences dures, et de tout ce qui touche à l'industrie, à la production, à l'innovation (y compris non-industrielle). Je n'ai rien contre les écoles de commerce, Science Po, etc. à la base.
Mais je pense que si le système tient, c'est JUSTEMENT parce qu'on a un potentiel extraordinaire.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"Federal Europe is good, but the problem is that all the plans until today have been stupid. Lets take for example...

* The banking union... Instead of making all banks Europe companies and letting only the EU tax them, and bailout them by using unlimited coffers of the ECB, we are just going to use the EU to transfer money via ESM/whatever from a member state to a member state. Oh, and we also let member states to tax them, so ensure we will have another banking crisis another day.
* The ECB and the balance sheet... Why does the ECB has to worry about balance sheets? It is a god damn central bank with fiat money, if they need more money, they snap their fingers, there is no real need to worry about accumulating capital from member states, etc... It is a god damn central bank, it should have rules that would enable it act fully as one.
* The single market only works if you keep states out of it. For example how hard it is for the French politicians to understand that it is unacceptable for them is to prevent PSA from shutting down a factory? If PSA wants to shutdown factory, they do it. They don't need some outsider to help them with that decision. If they want to move their whole god damn company out of France to for example Romania, that is their god damn decision and the politicians need to keep their noses out of it. 
* Member states and finances... Why is it so hard to accept that member states need to be able to go bankrupt? Going bankrupt is good, it is much better than to stay in uncertainty. Yes, it might mean that pensioners loose their pensions, bureaucrats their jobs, etc.. but there is nothing else that teaches hard economic reality better than a bankruptcy.

And another thing, federal Europe should be federation of member states, it shouldn't act or emulate a nation state. For example people in here many times just copy the model the US had and totally forgetting that US is a nation state. In Europe we have strong states that work, we should leverage that to our advantage.

Lots of English = English bars, shops, etc. - and the same happens with the other nationalities, so building up an area for 30 years to primarily cater for these people means that complaining that they're 'not interested in Spain or the Spanish' is a tiny bit daft, and would only be highlighted by the naive or someone that needed a news article and wanted to sell outrage....oh, hello Al Jazeera!",0,1342688681,null,0,false,0,c5g7n0i,t3_wr3f8,t1_c5g7n0i,t1_c5fwljx,null,1429414500,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

&gt;and bailout them by using unlimited coffers of the ECB, we are just going to use the EU to transfer money via ESM/whatever from a member state to a member state. 

It has been agreed that the common funds can be used to directly bailout banks, and not just to give them to the states etc. Also, the suggestions are that the bank's will participate in a common deposit insurance schemes, and have a central regulatory body etc etc.

This is exactly the mix of proposals that are designated by the phrase 'Banking union'. ESM's role you describe is older and has nothing to do with that term.

&gt;and bailout them by using unlimited coffers of the ECB

and what is supposed to force the ECB to do anything? why would they take the risks? They're independent, like any proper central bank, there is no power on this planet that can make the ECB bailout anyone they don't want to (and they're explicitly forbidden from certain forms of helping countries with their balance sheets).

&gt;
&gt; But in any case, I don't see how the ownership of the banks matters when dealing w systemic crises of financial system..

In good times when banks and financial firms make big profits, they pay big dividends and big bonuses to employees that the state then taxes these - this is their profit. However in bad times when banks and financial institutions start to go bust, it is suddenly a systemic crisis and everybody needs to chip on. Essentially some member states get benefits, while others only share the cost. That can't be right.

What needs to be done is that the EU, not the member states, taxes banks and financial firms, thus removing financial motivation from member states to give a blind eye to their banks in hope of short term gains for the economy.

As to how can this be achieved, easily, just change the treaties. 

&gt; It has been agreed that the common funds can be used to directly bailout banks, and not just to give them to the states etc. Also, the suggestions are that the bank's will participate in a common deposit insurance schemes, and have a central regulatory body etc etc.

That is taxpayer money that is put under risk. Why the hell as an Finnish taxpayer should I risk my money to save an Spanish bank? What is it in for me? There is big possibility, a risk, that the money won't never be paid back, not to mention that a bigger risk that the money won't ever come back with an interest that would have gained investing the same money in open markets.

&gt; and what is supposed to force the ECB to do anything? why would they take the risks? They're independent, like any proper central bank, there is no power on this planet that can make the ECB bailout anyone they don't want to (and they're explicitly forbidden from certain forms of helping countries with their balance sheets).

The thing is that if the ECB doesn't open up its coffers, then there is only finite amount of money to for example bailout banks and financial institutions, and that means there is a risk of system crash - possibility that there won't be enough money. Just look at the US, FDIC has long ago depleted its own reserves and if it wouldn't be for the FED pumping money, they would have had a system crash.

Again what needs to be done is to change the treaties. It is in the interest of the ECB that the Eurozone banking systems works, if banks and financial firms start go bust in domino effect, something needs to be done and the only one that can do something is the ECB.

&gt; ... and print inflation, which they're tasked to defend against as their primary mission... pls, this is just nonsense..

And there is huge hyperinflation in the US, people are desperate to find strong leader that will sort things out... Not so. Printing money in this situation is the only thing that will keep deflation out, and currently there is huge risk of Euroarea going into deflationary mode.

In reality they aren't able to go bankrupt, for example Greece should have defaulted in 2008, however their banks, pension funds and many other banks in the EU area would have gone bust. Political pressure from Germany and France forced the Greeks on not declaring bankruptcy, and then forced the other Eurozone states to bailout Greece, which essentially was a one big bailout of German and French banks.

Non, sérieusement, j'ai des chiffres sous les yeux toute la journée, et je n'ai aucune mesure objectivable et rigoureuse de la compétitivité.
Généralement, on utilise alors des indices synthétiques et/ou des raisonnements. La compétitivité, cela devient un ensemble de choses plus ou moins floues : qualité des infrastructures de transport, stabilité du système légal, productivité horaire, proximité des marchés, coût global du travail, toutes les mesures possibles du capital humain, etc.

Cela n'a rien de contradictoire avec ce que pourraient affirmer des ""partisans des 35h"" (on ne parle plus d'études ?) s'ils estimaient que la productivité horaire des Français (qui ne représente qu'une composante, entre autres, de la compétitivité...) a augmenté.

C'est pourquoi je le répète :
Ce n'est pas parce que tout le monde dit n'importe quoi que les études racontent n'importe quoi.
Et j'ajoute :
Si une étude raconte n'importe quoi ou ne fait pas preuve de rigueur, alors nous ne sommes pas devant une étude sérieuse.

Sanctions and other penalties may work, as well as the fear of losing reputation, but the fact is that often enough it does not. 
Now, what the international system is lacking obviously is an international sovereign enforcing those treaties. The difference to a federal union thus becomes clear: the EU functions as a 'sort-of' sovereign that punishes subordinates for their legal misbehaviour. In contrast to international sanctions outside of the EU, there would not be a nerve-wrecking process of agreeing on if, how, what, why etc. - it would simply enact the provisions in such a case. It would become more similar to how a state would enforce a law in and between its citizens (note - I said similar, not the same). Tools to do so, i.e. a functioning executive branch, do not exist on the international level.

true,metaleks,SERB,СРБИЈА,"Look, I get what you're trying to say. It makes sense. But realistically speaking, a country that doesn't care whether or not it's adhering to a treaty very likely won't care if it's in a federal union. Let's take your example of America during the Iraq War. Do any of us seriously think the war would have played out any differently were America in some sort of federal union full of other member states? We all like to think that Europe is different, but it's certainly conceivable that the big names in the EU would get the same treatment.

&gt; In contrast to international sanctions outside of the EU, there would not be a nerve-wrecking process of agreeing on if, how, what, why etc. - it would simply enact the provisions in such a case.

The irony here is that this could be implemented with a treaty. A treaty that outlines penalties and removes ""nerve-wrecking"" processes. There. No need for something as bulky as a federal union all to keep everyone in line. As a side note and going off on a tangent here, I still don't see how a federal union's penalties for a member state are any different than the penalties imposed upon countries today without such a union. Barring union-specific penalties, of course. Expulsion from a federal union isn't a problem for a state that isn't in one.

Also, the OP asked about the benefits of a federal union. I claimed that there was no difference between a federal union and a bunch of treaties. You only brought a very debatable point to the table (that penalties are easier to enforce), and nothing else, so I'm genuinely curious and would like to hear more benefits that can't be accomplished with international agreements and treaties.

Which is more of an example of how you're so desperate to take offence that you're not comprehending my statements. Are you really, seriously going to consider someone talking about a single region of one country as hating the entire country, or 'spanihate'? That's the same logic the BNP use when citing an area of immigrated Indians in London as somehow being an attack on the British, and you can guess at how well that sort of ultra-nationlism is received. Plenty of other countries also happily promote their tourist areas as Sun/ Beach with everything after that an optional side-benefit; why is it suddenly a problem for Spain? Or more accurately, Al Jazeera?

You're complaining about 'culture' in an area that originally was very sparsely populated (unless you consider culture as something that permeates everywhere regardless of how many people there are), then exploded once it was promoted *purely as a tourist destination*, something that has been pursued *by the Spanish* for the following fourty years, itself not exactly uncommon - there are plenty of other destinations that are fully aware that those visiting aren't coming primarily because they like the culture...which isn't to say that everyone visiting does that, either, but the point remains that it's optional - you can't then lambast people for using that option.

And no, I'm not from anywhere in Spain. Not sure how that makes any difference, though.

Want to give any other 'examples'?

c.a.d. : vous avez 1 000 000 de patrimoine, vou paierez X d'impôts dessus. Vous gagnez 900 000 euros de revenus annuels, cela sont taxés dans la tranche normale (45% je crois) d'IR, et votre patrimoine vous rapport disont 200 000, 100 000 seront aujoutés aux 900 000 et taxé à 45, et 100 000 le seront à 75. sur les 1 000 000 de revenu seul les 900 000 se verront appliqué la CSG et les les 200 000 se verront eux appliquer un taux normal de 15,5 sur les revenu de l'épargne. certes ça voudera dire que ces revenus là sont taxés pour une partie à 60% et pour une autre à 90%. Sauf que cela ne va concerner que la partie du revenue de l'épargne qui porte le revenue au delà d'1000000. Et l'adm° fiscale pour les grandes fortunes fait rarement x%+x%...

Et encore une fois les ""eventuels"" 83% sur le revenu ""salaire"" ne concerneront que les revenu qui dépasse 1 000 000 euros. 

De plus cela ne concerne pas les dividendes qui ne sont pas forcément ajoutés au revenu et qui parfois sont exemptés totalement...

Bref 1 000 000 / 12 = 83 000

en comptant les 45%+8% de CSG ça fair 39 000 net par mois, certes ça fait ""mal"" mais j'ai du mal à les plaindre à ce niveau là, faudra peut être moins voyager à l'autre bout du monde mais je doute que cela puisse être considéré une tragédie.",0,1342701600,null,0,1342726452,0,c5g8yy1,t3_wtadz,t1_c5g8yy1,t3_wtadz,null,1429415140,3,false,france,t5_2qhjz,3
true,Torquemada1970,null,null,"&gt;but respecting and preserving the local culture is a sine qua non condition.

No, actually it isn't. There are plenty of destinations in many countries with nice weather that don't follow that rule, because it's enforcing nationalism on an area that otherwise for all intents and purposes wouldn't exist anyway (at least, not in the numbers they do). Greece, Turkey and Spain (and many others) quite happily go along with this, because of the revenue it brings - for tourists, the culture and so on is *optional*, and in the case of Spain can easily be found by driving for half an hour anyway (usually less).

&gt;The economy is not everything.

The local councils, businesses and so on in these areas would disagree with you. Most of the Costa Blanca, for example, has been doing very nicely from tourism and ex-pats for many, many years.

&gt;If a region has been gentrified and depleted of its heritage through tourism

So...considering that places like Alicante and Benidorm were very, very small before capitalising on the tourist explosion, what heritage has been depleted? And 'gentification'? You're asserting that none of the Spanish have profited or benefitted from the incoming money in any way at all? It's not as if you can spot the Spanish because they're the ones who look poor in these areas. Quite the opposite.

&gt;then this is a mistake to be repaired

Really? You think that the local economies would survive without their number one source of income?

&gt;not an excuse to encourage further abuse.

Considering how badly Spain needs $ at the moment, this attitude is hilarious. But even ignoring that, you're disregarding why these places exist at all without any real alternative proposals for income.",0,1342701645,null,0,false,0,c5g8z6i,t3_wr3f8,t1_c5g8z6i,t1_c5g8pfg,null,1429415143,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Singapur,Cayman?...das sind keine Nachbarn dir direkt neben einem wohnen. Die Schweiz bescheisst alle seine direkten Nachbarn und die Schweizer selbst haben kein Problem damit. Sie haben kein Problem damit selbst nicht genügend Ärzte auszubilden aber fremdenfeindlich gegenüber den deutschen Gast-Ärtzen zu sein. Wenn das um normale Ausbildungsberufe ging, die von illegalen Immigranten belegt wären, würde das noch im Ansatz erklärbar sein.... aber so?! Total irre! Die Schweiz ist auf die EU angewiesen, die EU ist NICHT auf die Schweiz angewiesen.
Es würde ja völlig genügen, wenn die Schweiz sagt, wo sie steht:
Ja zu einer solidarischen Union unter Freunden ...oder eben Nein. Aber dann auch mit allen Konsequenzen. Dieses verlogene durchlavieren müssen sich die Bürger der EU nicht bieten lassen...und sie werden es auch nicht ewig. Sobald es ans Eingemachte geht, dürfte der Ton ernsthaft ruppig werden.

Und sein wir ehrlich, es ist nicht das erste Mal das die Schweiz sich um Verantwortung drückt. Eine Zahngolddebatte ist mit der Schweiz nicht zu machen...eine Aufarbeitung von Schuld schon gar nicht. 


Bzgl. der Niedriglohnpolitik, den Effekten und Deutschlands Schuld daran, sehe ich das ein bisschen anders. Ja, es hat bekackte Auswirkungen auf Europa. Aber der Niedriglohn wurde von Schröder eingeführt, nachdem Christdemokraten in einer 16jährigen Diktatur unter Kohl (und anderen Schwarzgeldbetrügern wie dem jetzigen Finanzminister Schäuble) Deutschland in die Pleite getrieben haben.
Helmut Kohl hat die Deutschen nach Strich&amp;Faden belogen, was die Finanzierung der Wiedervereinigung angeht....und dann nochmal, was die EU angeht. Hätte Deutschland keine Niedriglöhne eingeführt, gäbe es große Teile der deutschen Industrie heute nicht mehr.
Und ich glaube nicht, dass dieser Effekt nicht früher oder später auch bei Frankreich,Spanien,Italien,Griechenland angekommen wäre.
Also das Resultat wäre früher oder später in beiden Fällen das selbe gewesen, nur hat G.Schröder den Zusammenbruch der SozialenSysteme in Deutschland angefangen wohlwissentlich, dass der Zusammenbruch umso schlimmer gewesen wäre, desto später er in Deutschland angekommen wäre.

yes, which is why the financial sector should pay for its own bailouts - what you said (well w/o mentioning benefits to some member states being the result of it), was exactly the argument Barosso used in, I think it was a state of the union speech.

&gt; What needs to be done is that the EU, not the member states, taxes banks and financial firms, thus removing financial motivation from member states to give a blind eye to their banks in hope of short term gains for the economy.

agreed, a financial tax. not sure why the transaction tax seems to have gotten more currency than a financial asset tax, since that would be less risky re capital flight, and also less uneven in regards to how much the UK would have to pay.

But it is planned, though obv divisive.

&gt;That is taxpayer money that is put under risk. Why the hell as an Finnish taxpayer should I risk my money to save an Spanish bank? What is it in for me? 

would Finland be unaffected in the case of a systemic collapse of the european banking sector, which is what one risks w/o a mechanism for a last line of defense public fund? Certainly most Europe wouldn't be and its a matter you had a vote in anyhow - afaik required unanimity, with some supermajoritarian system only comming into effect in the future, though even that has many things decided by unanimity and i think countries are still (unfortunately imho) allowed not to pay if they vote against is. 

This  was a consequence of the situation with Slovakia some previous round of bailout discussion..

Note that it is expected from a country to pay for its banking depts, possibly borrowing money from the ESM if necessary, if at all able. I think we have not yet seen  this done for Spain, since it borrowed as a country from the ESM. which isn't that risky anyhow, provided the country is sufficiently tightly assessed and controlled until the danger has passed. Well, except one can apparently not necessarily trust expert economic opinion and analysis if one is to judge by the effects such a policy has in Greece.

&gt;The thing is that if the ECB doesn't open up its coffers, then there is only finite amount of money to for example bailout banks and financial institutions, and that means there is a risk of system crash

not that I necessarily disagree, but ECB has been envisoned as a 'hard bank' that has defending against inflation as its only goal, and not sure if the bundesbank would agree to anything else. And then there's also the thing they wish it used as a reserve currency, and esp as a young coin, its needs to demonstrate its stability.

so in consequence, they have tried to stay away from large monetary expansion during this crisis, trying to neutralize its periods of bond buying prob more consistently than FED or the UK.  This is seen as a mark of banking independence.

eg found this claiming so:
http://books.google.hr/books?id=wJE5UF0QEwgC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;lpg=PA118&amp;dq=neutralisation+monetary&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Th7Ss4e4Vm&amp;sig=fvFZmiIKbsyI1lvbaolq5XYL6IA&amp;hl=hr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TAYIUM7lHoqO4gSGkJTNBA&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=neutralisation%20monetary&amp;f=false

&gt; Printing money in this situation is the only thing that will keep deflation out, and currently there is huge risk of Euroarea going into deflationary mode.

yes, along with the current tempo of fiscal tightening. Its just that ECB cannot be made to do anything it doesn't want - and current ECB is dominantly against it. 

Also there are countries that are well suited by the current inflation policy - namely Germany. 

one could change the priorities of what the central bank should be doing, yes, by changing the treaties, and I agree it would be a positive step. But still, as long as the banking is truly independent, the states just cannot count on it behaving the way the government(s) want, and hence the need for an extra fiscal instrument for a financial crisis situation.

&gt; There is big possibility, a risk, that the money won't never be paid back, not to mention that a bigger risk that the money won't ever come back with an interest that would have gained investing the same money in open markets.

&gt; Greece should have defaulted in 2008, however their banks, pension funds and many other banks in the EU area would have gone bust. 

.. so they decided against it.

&gt;Political pressure from Germany and France forced the Greeks on not declaring bankruptcy,

likely, but again, it was impossible for them to impose that will legally, since Greece cannot be prevented from declaring bankruptcy. So a matter of political will in Greece.

That such a move would actually be beneficial for them, I find unlikely, given the enormous deficit and the threat of being pushed out of the currency possibly collapsing their economic system completely - without an ability to borrow from the european neighbours and solve their fiscal problems slower. No austerity yet imposed on them would have been as fierce as being locked out of the market with a substantial primary deficit  they initially had - and still aren't at break-even, so even doing it now was apparently a very divisive question in greece, judging by the votes.",0,1342703580,null,0,false,0,c5g99zo,t3_ws3ex,t1_c5g99zo,t1_c5g7y5k,null,1429415275,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

American security is so shitty that it really does depend on the officer that will ask you questions at customs.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; yes, which is why the financial sector should pay for its own bailouts - what you said (well w/o mentioning benefits to some member states being the result of it), was exactly the argument Barosso used in, I think it was a state of the union speech.

Financial sector can't pay its bailouts by itself. If you are going to try to save reserves from where bailouts are to be done, you are going to force international companies to relocate their finances outside Europe, and you still have only finite amount of money. No. Bailouts of financial sector should be paid by users of the currency via decreased value of money - in short, bailouts need to be done by printing money.

&gt;  agreed, a financial tax. not sure why the transaction tax seems to have gotten more currency than a financial asset tax, since that would be less risky re capital flight, and also less uneven in regards to how much the UK would have to pay.
&gt;
&gt; But it is planned, though obv divisive.

No. This isn't enough. We need to remove member states right to tax and thus profit from the financial sector. This is the only way we to remove the moral hazard from member states to take risks that put the whole Euroarea in danger.

&gt; would Finland be unaffected in the case of a systemic collapse of the european banking sector, which is what one risks w/o a mechanism for a last line of defense public fund? Certainly most Europe wouldn't be and its a matter you had a vote in anyhow - afaik required unanimity, with some supermajoritarian system only comming into effect in the future, though even that has many things decided by unanimity and i think countries are still (unfortunately imho) allowed not to pay if they vote against is. 

The whole world would be affected in the Euroarea banking system would collapse, that isn't the point. The point is that it is unsustainable to create mechanisms that are unfair. If you take a risk, you get the reward, but if you transfer your risk, you don't deserve your reward. Now, past is past, but the future mechanism that we create should be one that are fair to all. In case of financial markets, in the Eurozone the only fair way to deal with it in the future is to transfer both rewards and risks to the EU.

&gt; Note that it is expected from a country to pay for its banking depts, possibly borrowing money from the ESM if necessary, if at all able. I think we have not yet seen this done for Spain, since it borrowed as a country from the ESM. which isn't that risky anyhow, provided the country is sufficiently tightly assessed and controlled until the danger has passed. Well, except one can apparently not necessarily trust expert economic opinion and analysis if one is to judge by the effects such a policy has in Greece.

It is under great question on can the southern states at all reinvent their economies to create new growth. It is just not the banking crisis. Southern states haven't worked enough in order to fair in global competition, and as competition will increase, their ability to compete will decrease even further if drastic measures aren't taken. Not to mention the pension time bombs, there aren't enough money in pension funds to fund future pensions and future generations are smaller than ones retiring. The markets have already given their judgement - things are unsustainable.

&gt; one could change the priorities of what the central bank should be doing, yes, by changing the treaties, and I agree it would be a positive step. But still, as long as the banking is truly independent, the states just cannot count on it behaving the way the government(s) want, and hence the need for an extra fiscal instrument for a financial crisis situation.

One needs to change priorities of the ECB as all extra fiscal instruments are insufficient when they have finite amount of money to use. What I will think that is going to happen is that there will be more and more places where the ESM needs to put money, and as more and more money is used, the less there is in the instrument, and the more nervous the markets will be leading to ever increasing circle of death.

For example in case of Greece, most of their debt is already to other member states, and they will need bailout after bailout to make sure that they don't default their debts to other EU member states. That is just crazy. It will only lead to markets starting to speculate on ability of better rated countries to continue with current course.",0,1342705875,null,0,1342706071,0,c5g9pcy,t3_ws3ex,t1_c5g9pcy,t1_c5g99zo,null,1429415473,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

50 years ago, even 20 years ago, it made more sense.

Now communication and transportation has reached such a level where we don't all need to be under the control of one government. In Europe now we can even communicate across languages in an instant, and it's only going to get better. So then the benefits of federalization are slowly becoming antiquated and don't outweigh the negative aspects.

The negative aspects include a loss of influence in each person's vote, the creation of a giant security apparatus, the use of one-size-fits-all political solutions, an onerous and detached central government, and more.

Don't get me wrong, I do believe in cooperation.

Customs won't know if you don't tell them, which you won't. Customs also will not see you with your bag, as you claim your luggage after clearing customs.

I live in between Lavapies, La Latina, Tirso de Molina and Embajadores. I can walk to the metro of each place in about 3 minutes. I've seen the one room flats in an old apartment in Lavapies which may be shitty for housing more than one person but it can also be just fine for one. There are a variety of flats in the area and many of them are awesome. Rooftop balconies, side building balconies, remodeled interiors and the kinds of things anyone wants.

The area is really hilly? I've heard this before but I grew up in Washington state for a few years and they have real hills everywhere and the subtle incline and decline one can find around lavapies isn't really worth being bothered about unless you're over the age of 70 or so.

Petty crime? Welcome to a dense big city. Petty crime is something that happens everywhere in Madrid. I wouldn't hold this against Lavapies unless you're afraid of someone offering you a drug or two as you walk by those lit, public areas. These areas aren't even dark ones and everyone knows whats going on. Some people actually consider this an advantage to this part of town.

The restaurants and bars are many and diverse as well as the people too. I've known people who lived in shitty apartment in Lavapies and moved out of it but then regretted leaving the area because the life here is something special. If you're social person then you'll be in heaven. There's loads of activities going throughout the year, loads of organizations meeting throughout the week and great little shops. You can get a small town feeling here and then walk ten minutes to get to the center of Madrid. 

I really love it obviously. I can see it following the path of the art district in LA or Brooklyn in NY.

I see lots of people walking up slowly with their groceries bags and I always think it must suck to have to go up an down these types of streets on a daily basis.
