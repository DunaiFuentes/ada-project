true,Skulder,DENK,Denmark,"I'm Danish first.

When I talk to people whom I don't expect to know every single country of Europe, I'm just European (or Scandinavian).

As far as the EU goes, I'm Danish, and Denmark is in the EU. I will grudgingly admit to being a EU-citizen, but it ranks about as highly as the fact that I'm a citizen in a NATO member state.

The thing is, this is related to identity. In order for me to efficiently introduce myself, I can say that I'm Danish (and hold many of the shared cultural Danish values), or that I'm Scandinavian (and hold a lot of the shared Scandinavian cultural values). I can even say that I'm European (and that I hold some of the shared European values).

The farther I go from my region, the more fuzzy the concept becomes - what are the shared European cultural values even? It adds less and less information to the introduction of me - If I say that I'm from the Northern Hemisphere, it's correct, but it tells people very little about who I am, and what cultural values I subscribe to.

The thing about the EU is that it's relatively new, it's been through some rough periods, and people are still very ambivalent about it. Also, the EU, with it's large horde of bureaucrats and changing members, have not shown itself to be stable.

The EU is changing direction all of the time, and as such it changes values as well. Local politicians will often suggest some illegal law, and claim that it was shot down by the EU, thus creating the image of the EU as some bureaucratic, anti-democratic monster, which certainly doesn't help it's image.

So I'm a Vesterbro*-boy first and foremost, a Copenhagener, a Dane, a European etc. too, but I do not affiliate my identity with the European Union, any more than with which bank I'm using.

Edit: since my English sucks and my knowledge about financial stuff is even less than zero, I summarize (and ask control questions) and maybe so. can correct me when wrong:

Austria's stance regarding FTT is (unsurprisingly) divided because their economy depends more on the financial sector than, f.i., Germany's? Therefor being attractive for investement is essential for Austria, but they know that it's actually necessary to get an FTT because outherwise other countries (esp. East-European ones) could make the same and the whole financial sector gets dangerous (again)? 

What are ""captured"" regulatory bodies? I understand ""regulatory bodies"" (like the Bafin in Germany which is looking at Banks that they have enough own money before they invest). The same exists for the EU (I think they renamed/restructured the regulatory bodies for financial stuff recently, but made a step back???). However, due to context I read ""captured"" as ""open"", since the regulatory bodies in the UK and US are more ""pro-financial sector"".

Next word: ""volatile"". Is this a technical term? I udnerstand the translation (in the cheical way)...but can I translate it with ""high frequency"" or more like ""instable""?

It's harder for British people to recognise this might be the case as our borders have not been close to as fluid as the Mainland being pretty much stable for 400 years. 

I think a lot of people here would be shocked to find out that Germany as we know it has only existed for around 140 years and during that period has seen many many border changes.

&gt;Again, necessarily false in a free society.

That should probably be reworded to something like food / music you're most likely to enjoy. This will mean less and less over time  as the movement of people within Europe increases.

I don't mean that in a chauvinistic or nationalistic sense, because it's mostly a coincidence of language, but it is still there. I think if your language has a relatively small number of speakers it means that watching, reading or listening to foreign media is much more of a standard activity across all levels of society. That also encourages you to learn other languages, especially if you watch subtitled films and TV. 

In Britain, there is just not the same necessity to move beyond the English language, so consuming foreign media or speaking foreign languages becomes to one degree or another an elite activity, seen as pretentious, pseudo intellectual or artificial. This means that British engagement with European culture is either at a high level (arthouse cinema, orchestral/classical music, European philosophers etc), or at a low level (Eurovision, or the general 'Eurotrash' trend), but not much in between, so that the mass of the population don't feel comfortable with other European cultures.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"&gt; In Italy and France during school you're (usually) pushed to learn at least two languages: English nowadays is quite compulsory. French, German and (more and more) Spanish are encouraged as well. As you can guess, it's quite difficult learn and really master a foreign language in classroom, but it's not stigmatized at all. Quite the contrary.

Reading back what I'd written I'm not sure I'm expressing myself perfectly. Speaking a foreign language is an elite activity, but that doesn't necessarily mean that it is stigmatized. You would get a great deal of respect and status for being fluent in another language. The stigma would come from trying to bring up some piece of European culture, really in large part just because it'd probably be obscure. If you said ""oh I read this French book, in French"" the reaction would be ""so this is an excuse to tell me you speak French"", as if you were boasting; if you said ""oh I read this French book, in translation"" the reaction would be ""great..."", much as if you said you'd listened to some unheard-of indie band, again, as if you were boasting of how cultured and eclectic your tastes were. That's what I mean when I say artificial or pretentious.

&gt; I don't think so. Again, it's American culture to be widespread, more than the British one. And I feel that American English is slowly becoming predominant even in ESL teaching over Europe (that's my idea, maybe I'm wrong). 

Picking films as something relatively easy to compare, I managed to find [this](http://sy09.ukfilmcouncil.ry.com/?id=41161) giving box offices for foreign-language films in Britain. The German language take is about $1.5m. Looking at the [German box office for 2008](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/intl/germany/yearly/?yr=2011&amp;p=.htm), you have a James Bond film taking $41m, Mamma Mia (British playright, director, half the cast British) taking $39m. Last year you had the King's Speech taking $20m odd, and the last Harry Potter $80m. Obviously this is nice for Britain to some degree, but it'd be better if the whole thing were more two way. If the European smash hits, like La Vie En Rose (La Mome), Downfall (Der Untergang), Gomorrah, Lives of Others (Das Leben der Anderen) etc were mainstream films in Britain, but unfortunately, at present they're strictly for the well-educated professional classes. The way that English people get European film culture is through things like Tintin (animated, so watched in English), Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (remade in English), The Reader, The Pianist (both from European source material, but made in English) and so on.",0,1332345347,null,0,false,0,c43d74u,t3_r5ngn,t1_c43d74u,t1_c43b7uv,null,1428566523,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Yes, *we* did. As Europeans. Not Brits specifically, but don't you think it's *extremely* naïve to think that there is something inherent in British culture that prevents it from ever turning into the fascist regimes that the 20th century has taught us all too much about?

&gt; Excuse me, but someone from another country telling me I must not view the UK as anything other than an 'administrative unit' seems rather like the fascism you claim you're trying to avoid.

I'm sorry, but do you know what fascism is? It is not simply someone telling someone else what to do. It's the notion that one culture or nation is inherently superior to another, and the idea that ""foreign"" elements are inherently damaging to the social fabric of a nation or society.

When I say that we *must* avoid that road, it is not merely bullying. It is historical imperative.

&gt; I think of my country, warmly, and with some amusement, as my home and the source of a great deal of fine traditions, with a history somewhat mixed, as is the case with most countries, but on the whole a place to feel rather pleased about. I am not going to be told off by someone else for that.

And that's not what I'm trying to do. I'm trying to separate the concepts of state and culture. The word ""country"" is a conflation of these two concepts, and it's a worthy cause to be aware of this dual meaning.

I am willing to bet that your fondness of your home country is not a particular fondness for the bureaucracy, government, and administration of your country. That's why it's a good idea to clarify that it is your *culture* that you (rightly) appreciate, and realize that your *state* is not a representation of your culture — it's simply a way to manage practical things within that culture.

&gt; Yes, that's fine, we are a democracy. A better one than the bloody EU.

""captured"" as it refers to regulatory bodies is closer to “enslavement” and it means that such institutions are subservient (slaves) to the industries that they are supposed to be regulating.  So that any regulation that might be happening is weak, ineffective, useless, and designed to hide what is truly going on.

""volatile"" in this case is not “flüchtig” but “schwankungsanfällig” (I have never seen that word in a sentence) as it refers to markets where the rate and magnitude of change in the market are far greater than normal or conditions would otherwise indicate.  So that’s “Higher Frequency” “More Unstable” “Less Predicable” “Less Rational” “Less Beneficial”


I am not an expert in Austrian economics (yet) and I do not know how large or central the Austrian financial sector is compared to our overall economy relative to similar metrics for the German economy.  Nor am I an expert in Austrian politics... I’m just an American expat living here.  However, my understanding of the Austrian politicians stance on FTT is that it is based more on their ideological beliefs and how corrupt they are than it does from a sort of  technocratic assessment of facts and metrics.  The prominent exception are Maria Fekter &amp; Andreas Schieder  but I have the impression that the media has concluded that both are ‘too boring’ to be allowed to go on at length least they actually explain something important using long words which many people don’t understand.

About the exposure of Austrian banks to risky loans in Eastern Europe: A FTT does not directly effect the ability or likelihood that private financial institutions will engage in stupid and risky transactions and I have not heard a serious proposal from any competent person which would.  However, one thing is certain: There isn’t anything about the markets right now that is all that different than summer of 2008, there is no technical reason that similarly unpleasant circumstance might come together now as they did then and cause similar catastrophic events.  More importantly neither Germany or Austria has the resources today to deal with such a hypothetical event as they did in the end of 2008 to 2009.  This emphasizes the need in some folks minds to gather those resources.  However, some politicians have a sort of ideological / religious stance: No new, more, or different taxes.  No agreeing with anything having to do with the EU.  No taxing people who have enough money to bribe me.  No management or “interference” in the markets.  Then conversely “No taxing the poor” “Tax the bastards that caused all this mess to begin with”, etc...

Having said all of that, from a technical point of view a FTT does not need to be a large tax, it needs to be a broad tax.  Nor does it necessarily mean that the government must earn more in tax revenue.  A skillful FTT could leave the government with as much taxes coming in as it had before (or not).  Therefore the questions “Should we implement a Financial Transaction Tax” and “Should the government increase taxation” are two separate questions.

My personal opinion is that we should prefer taxation on things that have complicated negative impacts which are not borne by the parties in the transaction (Negative Externalities) like pollution, health risks, carbon, consumption (VAT) or ultra-high-speed trading than real income (this means things like wages for real work and things like profit from selling goods).  I also think that governments around the world are facing the absolute need to reduce their public debt and that means both reducing spending and increasing the taxes coming in.  It would also help if the U.S. would refrain from invading and occupying any more nations... but here in Europe the military spending issue is different and more complicated.",0,1332350442,null,0,true,0,c43ebpv,t3_r4zbn,t1_c43ebpv,t1_c43a2vp,null,1435728783,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

That's correct. We Brits didn't.

&gt;*but don't you think it's extremely naïve to think that there is something inherent in British culture that prevents it from ever turning into the fascist regimes*

No. That would be one of my points. There is something about British culture that would have made serious popular fascism impossible. You won't get the reference but one only has to think of Chaplin and *The Great Dictator* or Wodehouse and Roderick Spode, his marvelous pisstake of Oswald Mosley:

&gt;*The trouble with you, Spode, is that just because you have succeeded in inducing a handful of half-wits to disfigure the London scene by going about in black shorts, you think you're someone. You hear them shouting ""Heil, Spode!"" and you imagine it is the Voice of the People. That is where you make your bloomer. What the Voice of the People is saying is: ""Look at that frightful ass Spode swanking about in footer bags! Did you ever in your puff see such a perfect perisher?""*

Sense of humour. It helps.

&gt;*It's the notion that one culture or nation is inherently superior to another,*

Actually, no, that isn't what fascism is. If you're going to be so impolite as to try to correct me then why not get your bloody definition correct?

&gt;*This rhetoric falls completely flat, when the UK (together with Denmark) has consistently worked against indisputable improvements to the EU democracy, which you are completely right is severely lacking.*

That's so incoherent i don't know where to begin.

&gt;*but of course there's still a long way.*

As I said. We have a democracy, we don't need the EU or any state in the EU to explain it to us.

Thanks all the same.

Don't insult my intelligence. We're having this conversation in your language.

&gt; Sense of humour. It helps.

It really does. When I see UK parties like the BNP, what strikes me is not their sense of humor. Nor do I have much faith that the British sense of humor has a better chance of surviving devastating depression or mortal military threats, such as what has invariably preceded every fascist European regime.

Indeed, your sense of humor (which I might add is shared by most of the continent — which you would already know, had you been able to understand their language and cultures) has not saved you from the crippling amounts of authoritarian legislation passed by your parliament in the wake of 9-11.

During the day I recommend to walk around Carrer de Sants. The people from Sants neighborhood say it is the biggest commercial street in Europe by number of shops. I don't know if it is true, but it is a long street that goes well into Hospitalet. You have a market (mercat de Hostafrancs) next to the hotel (in Carrer de Sants) an always interesting visit.

In Plaza España you have a recently open mall. Nothing interesting, but my parents in law love it.

For a beer I recommend a short walk to Poble Sec or Sant Antoni neighborhoods. Poble Sec is the right side of Parallel Street and Sant Antoni is on the left. In the last years they've become trendy again. I recommend some places for dinner:

 * [Tickets](http://g.co/maps/s58bm), Ferran Adrià new restaurant (but you won't be able to get a reservation) or [Rias de Galicia](http://www.riasdegalicia.com/) (a Galician Restaurant with very good seafood) on the expensive side.
 * [La Cañota](http://g.co/maps/mcpdn) a tapas site next to Rias de Galicia (both in Carrer Lleida).

For drinks, you'll have to walk some more to 
 
 * [Tinta Roja](http://g.co/maps/yh7nt)
 * [Rouge](http://g.co/maps/jqbt7)
 * Any place along [Blai Street](http://g.co/maps/3qzb8)

 On the other side of Parallel I recommend for dinner/tapas:

 * [Bohemic](http://g.co/maps/aj2tf)
 * [Casa Lucio](http://g.co/maps/h7h59)
 * [Pa i Trago](http://g.co/maps/sxry7) for classical Catalan food.

Degree in English / History? Good luck with that, mate. I doubt you'll find something but teaching and not even in schools. No Master of Education, no teaching English in schools. It is actually a problem to get a place for educational English at some German universities and people from the UK are in favour over Americans. No idea about History. But I don't thing you can do that in schools either. You need to teach at least 2 subjects. That means you have History in the American education system which nobody in Germany can check and English you can't teach because they have enough proper educated guys. If you'd have studied Engineering you could always do math and physics or go to an technology college (college like in the UK. Not the US college. That's a university in Germany) and teach 20 subjects if you want.

Computers and Networking? Worthless, I suppose. Too many people do IT or CS until college (again. UK and not US college) or do professional training (which is another criteria for computer stuff jobs in Germany if you haven't done anything for a long time in the US. I doubt that with 26). 

I suppose the cooking was just a joke.

I'm sorry if that sounds hard but History is near to uncheckable if you talk about skills (especially if you don't know much about the education system in other countries) and English teachers mostly lived in the UK for a year or two if they've got a job that gets nice paid. Engineering and computer stuff is not really something you can get away with if you are 26, studied History and English and maybe tried to get a job about History and English.

Well, the Albanians have the same pride about being unique. And don't even start me on the Greeks :)

&gt;I, for one, don't agree with the Romanians being situated in the Balkans because I feel that the typical Balkanic music is not part of our national identity.

I don't think it's abut the music (although there are Balkan influences, especially in the south). It's about the „culture” so to speak, the Turkish influence that still lingers. The whole absurdness of it all, and here I'm thinking about Kusturica for example. But also the politics. But It's true, sometimes it's difficult to tell Eastern Europe apart from the Balkans.

When I mean they are biased I refer to the fact that they abandon fairness in reporting, and do the utmost to spin every conceivable news as somehow being the Regime's fault. Don't be mistaken, I too think the Regime has a lot to answer for, but still.

I'm all for critique of the ruling party, but when one does it in a manner that reminds one of Fox News, it's doing more harm than good. Especially whit the talk-shows that are basically hysterical anti-regime rants with little substance. A lot of news is at the level of Can-Can (for non-Romanians: *Bild, Daily Mail* and such), but to be fair, a lot of news in other TV stations is like that  as well.

And don't think the pro-regime news outlets outnumber the anti-regime ones.

true,Bhima,ASTR,Austria,"Well, currently there is no ""EU Börse"" there are only national ones, like the ones in London or Frankfurt and there is no ""EU tax collector"" or ""EU taxation"".  In that sense the structure of the EU is very different than the structure of the Federal Government in America and the relationships between the EU nations and the EU (and other EU nations) is very different between US states and the Federal Government  (and other US states).

So it would take substantially different sorts of treaties in the EU to create those sorts things.  Which complicates matters because it's completely possible that a Italian owned company having a division located in Austria making money on the Börse in Frankfurt, london, and Vienna. (I just described my bank, Bank Austria which is owned by UniCredit SpA).

Also while the US is a transfer union (States pay in to the Federal Government more or less than they receive from the Federal Government) the EU is not.  So not only does the mechanism for collecting a broad, EU wide tax, and then redistributing back to member nations not exist, the idea does not already exist either.  However, EU governance does cost money to run and currently there are bidirectional payments going on in this regard... so it's not a completely novel setup.

Having said all of that, in broad strokes a skillful FTT would be collected EU wide (this probably means harmonized national FFT tax rates collected by member nations) with some sort of offset (which is probably a harmonized lowering of business income tax levied by member states).  So the need for everything to be equal to prevent market distortion would be covered by harmonized tax rates and local collection (where in the US the Federal Government could just do all of this in Federal Tax law and it would apply to all the states equally without the need for specific treaties or agreements).

I don't know if you follow US politics or are interested in US governance but I think this issue highlights the difference in the structure of governance between the EU member states and the EU and the US states and the Federal Government (which I find very interesting).

And these companies usually have an international hiring process in place, and they will consider your profile and interview you in your own country without having to travel to Germany at all.

Most of the jobs in Germany are not in the hands of big corporations, but in the many thousands of small firms, often based in small towns in the middle of nowhere, making and selling parts or services for them. This kind of company will have a few employees with a college degree and several tens or a couple hundreds of labour workers and won't take anyone that doesn't speak German. They might not even speak English very well or with enough confidence.

And even in the tourist industry, you might need to speak English 99% of the time, but the lingua franca with your boss and coworkers will still be German.

If you just plan to travel to Germany and look for a job, and you don't speak German, it will be very, very hard to find one, even as landscaper (there are plenty of eastern european inmigrants already living there, looking for those very same jobs). I'd say that you'll need a B1 level for any menial job, and B2 or C1 for anything where a college degree is required (apart from the abovementioned exceptions).

And having said that, I have achieved B1 level in German (from zero) in 15 months:

* 3 month A1-a intensive, 6h/week.
* 3 month A1-b intensive, 6h/week.
* 3 month A2, super-intensive, 12h/week.
* 6 month B1, 3h/week, but with private lessons and a hugeload of homework every week.

And it can be done in less time. In the same German school I went to there are super-intensive 4 month courses (A1+A2 or B1). Of course with lots of homework, satellite German TV, German websites, German films, etc.

No culture hold any single value that is unique to that culture - that would be impossible.

Many cultures hold a *combination* of values that set them apart from many other cultures, but which also makes them very much like other cultures.

In order to prove this, I would only have to name a value that is a typical cultural value, which is not commonly held by Danes.

In other words - if we say that there is a cultural value for every letter of the alphabet, then within the European Union, we can find every letter of the alphabet, except for Z (which is... the religious sacrament of eating select bodyparts of dead family members at funerals. I don't think that's prevalent in Europe any longer).

Denmark has them all, except for C (excessive bribes), and C is also absent from many other nation's cultural values. You'll also find that P (fixing stuff instead of buying new stuff) is receding from Denmark, whereas it's still a powerful thing in Poland, among other countries.

It's not a problem to find another nation where C and P is also not present, but you'll find that mostly some other cultural value is also not present there, which is present in Denmark, or Denmark is missing some cultural value, which is is present in the other Culture you compare with.

And when you make the entire list of European values, you'll find that Denmark doesn't have a single value which isn't also present in some other country, but you *will* find that Europe as a whole will have some values that are only weakly present in Denmark.

This is true for every single cultural group you declare - be it nations or neighbouring villages. There will always be more similarity than difference.

They didnt get on the standard German bandwaggon, yet I as native German (south German even) am able to read dutch texts and am able to get most of it. When I was ~7 years old during holidays in the Netherlands I played all day with some kid who spoke a bit funny, but our childish limited vocabulary was close enough to understand each other without trying.

What I am trying to say is, the German languages were different, but never too far away so you can't communicate at a basic level. A Swabian wouldn't have been able discuss higher topics with a Saxon, but he would have been able to sell him that bag of noodles he carries.

Yet there was always some sort of lingua franca, a language of the merchants so to say. Luthers bible didn't invent a new lingua franca for the Germans, he just used current lingua franca and exposed the broad population more to it.

most people who speak either plattdeutsch or frisian can communicate quite well in ""high-german"".. though most of them have a noticable accent..

frisian is competly diffrent language and it's therefor harder to understand for native ""high-german"" speakers.. 
plattdeutsch/niederdeutsch on the other hand is a dialect..

does it sound like dutch. hm.. dunno.. imo plattdeutsch sounds like a mix from german, englisch and dansk/dutch.. depending on, where you live.. in north germany it has more in common with dansk, while it sounds more like dutch the nearer you get to the dutch border..

I absolutely agree about certifications. They really are proof that you're capable of what you're claiming. But you don't need a certain university degree of apprenticeship to get a certification. And if you're claiming to know a specific field of expertise, but don't have a degree or proof about it, it's probably best to cough up the money and get a certification.

Companies that hire based on degree alone - without considering ""Quereinsteiger"" - are doing something wrong. And unfortunately it's the norm in Germany.

US companies are different in that regard, and that explains why they are more successful. For example Phil Schiller - SVP of marketing at Apple - has a degree in Biology.

This selling to China that is happening in Portugal (there are rumors of them buying the biggest private portuguese bank, BCP and they are also in the race for the Shypyards that are being privatized) will leave Portugal very vulnerable to Chinese preassure in basically everything since it's economy will be extremely dependent on Chinese Companies controlled by the Chinese Government.

In Germany I only saw Duesseldorf(obviously), Wuppertal, Cologne, Munich. For Austria; Graz, Salzburg, Vienna. I stayed in Graz for maybe a week and a half since the friend I came with used to live there as a teenager and was hanging out with friends.

People never seemed to know me and my friend were American, so I never ran into the problem of people only responding in English. People seemed fine to me, I don't remember noticing people being exceptionally kind or unkind, I was threaten to be deported by my host family though(I brought someone home, I guess i wasn't supposed to do that). I remember thinking how nice it was the young and old people were out and about(here I don't see older people out doing much really)

what did I like? pretty much everything. In alot of ways I felt more at home there than the US. I distinctly remember not liking how everything is dubbed in German on tv/ films. I didn't want to leave, and I remember thinking I'd be sad if I wasn't back by the time I was 24...I just turned 24 and haven't been back yet :(. I've been trying to look for work over there though, almost got one too, but alas I am still here in the US.

edit: not sure if anyone here is from Wuppertal, but my impression of that town was it's strange, but with hanging trams. I was there for a short time and got off the train to see drug heads around the hauptbahnhof and went down the street for a kugel of eis or a tea or something and some woman smacked a bee into her daughter's face where it stung the kid.

I majored in German Studies, so I could carry on a conversation when I went over, but my vocab exploded once I was there. I lived in Stuttgart most of the time but visited Heidelberg, Berlin, Munich, Koln, Dresden, and a bunch of other places. 

People were generally very friendly, and they seemed to take it as a compliment that I was learning their language. There was a decent amount of anti-american sentiment at the time, but Germans didn't really participate in it. They recognized that I was not George Bush. This contrasts with Ireland and England where people were kind of assholes as soon as they found out I was American. I felt so much more at home and welcome in Germany than I did in other English-speaking countries.

Germans are awesome. I like that in clubs, they keep a respectful distance when dancing, they don't wear skimpy clothes, which I guess could be construed to make them seem uptight, but I think it just shows that they respect themselves. 

The only thing that I really didn't like is the fact that it's difficult to find a bathroom that you don't have to pay for, and there aren't nearly as many water fountains in public buildings as there are here. I really liked that there were little bakeries all over the place, so you could always start your day with fresh bread. 

The subway and commuter rail were also so clean and safe. It's embarrassing for me to ride the T in Boston and think about how much nicer the Stuttgarter U-Bahn was.

Basically every German city has a very public memorial to the victims of the Holocaust. It's almost over the top, but it's nice to see a government that actually admits and apologizes for its mistakes.

But the most interesting memorial I saw was one that commemorates the suffering of the German people during the war. It has a number of names, including rubble mountain and devil's mountain. Basically, they piled all the rubble after the city got bombed on top of a hill, and put a little memorial up there. This is something that wasn't on tourist maps, wasn't where lots of people could see it. It was something that I found purely by chance out in the middle of the woods on a bike ride. Up on the hill, seeing pieces of people's homes, schools, stores, all destroyed by bombs really shows the destruction of Germany by the allies. You start to think of all the people who really suffered at the hands of the Nazis. It wasn't only the Jews, the German people had on one side the Nazis and their oppressive regime and on the other side, the Allies and their bombs. I did a bit of research at the time and found out that just about every city has a devil's mountain, but some are covered up, so you'd never know that it contains all the shattered remains of their cities. 

TLDR; Germany has good people, good bread, good transit and only very publicly recognize the crimes of their government, and only privately recognize the pain of having their country destroyed during the war.

My experiences (with the caveat that I have been only in the South and West, never in the very North or East).

Note that these are huge generalizations, based on subjective, anecdotal experience, and obviously with loads of exceptions.

The bad things:

- way too concerned about following rules.  People wait to cross the street at a red light.  WTF?
- terrible sense of architecture (to be fair, most cities did get blown up and they had to build things fast, and haven't gotten around to building nicer things)
- nobody fucking smiles on the street, people often seem pretty uptight at first glance
- world's worst drivers
- a weird mixture of ""protzig"" (i.e. nouveau riche, like to show off wealth, drive flashy cars) and ""missgönnerisch"" when it comes to successful people
- a lot of younger German women just talk so damn loudly and too much
- local public transportation inside cities is often expensive and unreliable (to be fair maybe that's just a mixture of where I live combined with bad experiences, but it's been pretty universal)

The good things:

- loads of open space compared to cities in other countries
- things aren't so centralized
- once you get talking to them, people can be extremely friendly (this is in Rheinland, I understand that this is part of what they are proud of but I've had the same impression everywhere)
- know how to build for cold weather
- European brunch champions
- extremely professional to work with (at least in my experience)
- DHL delivery in Germany is awesome (okay it's a small thing but holy shit I'm impressed)
- loads of small fun new innovative restaurants run by unpretentious nice people
- German movies and music can be awful and trite, but when it's good, it's of amazing quality.  Too bad it often does not translate well
- bread.  Mmh.

true,RobertM525,null,null,"&gt;It's not like they are foreign languages getting forged together. They all come from the same root and evolved slowly in contact with neighbouring languages. 

Absolutely true. They *are* part of a dialect continuum. But what I, as an outsider, don't know (and the reason for this post), is just how wide the spread is of that continuum, so to speak. Because although English is a Germanic language, I certainly can't understand Dutch or German. :) (Though, yeah, the historical reasons for that are pretty dramatic.)

&gt;Take the modern Dutch language for example, if the political situation would have been different, their language would be classified as a dialect now, too. They didnt get on the standard German bandwaggon, yet I as native German (south German even) am able to read dutch texts and am able to get most of it. When I was ~7 years old during holidays in the Netherlands I played all day with some kid who spoke a bit funny, but our childish limited vocabulary was close enough to understand each other without trying.

I've always wondered about that! To me, Dutch sounds like German with a funny accent, but I'm not even remotely fluent in German—in fact, I feel like I've forgotten most of what German I knew. :(

I would imagine that it might be *somewhat* like the situation with Spanish—there's a definite continuum across the Iberian peninsula (despite Franco's attempts to kill it). Catalan is called a separate lanaguage but, realistically, it's a dialect of Spanish (*castellano*), though it's not called that for cultural/political reasons. The point is, Catalan is not incomprehensible to someone from Madrid.

&gt;If you can read German, I suggest reading these 2 wiki articles

true,[deleted],null,null,"Out of fairness, let me explain why I make this claim.  I'm seriously not trying to exaggerate.

More German drivers than anywhere else in Europe seem to have an addiction to large, expensive, fast, black German cars.  Mostly the ones you notice are driven by frustrated middle-aged people 30-50, either housewives or ""serious businessmen"".

These cars seem to come in 3 types - the Kombi, the excessively large limousine, and the Geländewagen.  Mostly the first and last seem to also usually be extremely badly parked, but generally the types who come screaming up behind you on the Autobahn with no regard for whether you are able to pull over or not, flashing their lights and road-raging if you can't move over.

In cities, I've never seen so many people have trouble with the (large amount of) space available for driving.  Even in parking garages, large compared to those in France or Spain, there are tons of scrapes on the wall.

Nowhere else in the world have I ever seen any drivers so consistently competitive - I have to be first, me me me, mash on the gas to be the first in line or to get ahead of you.  People seem to spend wayyy too much time slamming on the gas or brakes, even for short distances in traffic.  And they get mad about it too.  Gesticulating, nasty looks, shouting things (not so much at me, I tend to be pretty relaxed and let people in) but at each other.  Grr!  

By contrast, you can be tootling along at 160, minding your own business, and somebody will pull into the passing lane in their creaky old Open going 90, even though they would have had a ton of time to let you get past them and then move over.  The rear-view mirrors seem to be mainly for decoration.

And there is just so much face-palming randomness - just watching traffic for half an hour at a given intersection will give you way too many opportunities to ask yourself, my god, WHAT IS HE TRYING TO DO?

I'm going to get hate from the Germans for this, but I _like_ French drivers.

Now the numbers of how much more public workers make are debatable in itself, Public sector workers have a higher degree of qualification on average, sectors like Education (from basic teachers to univerty professors), Justice (judges, magistrates, etc.) Health (doctors, nurses, etc.) and Foreign affairs (diplomats and similiar) all have a huge percentage of highly qualified people that push the average salary up.

TBH, you can't have a car crazy country with no speed limit without rules. Apart from the mentioned punishments you have to consider that it is just easier to follow the rules than to break them. If you want to cross a red light you have to look if you endanger anyone including yourself. If you make a mistake someone gets hurt. And since you don't gain a lot, why not simply wait? Also, German driver also demand their rights. Sure, everyone is told to drive defensively, but if you have the green light, you have the green light.

I found people to be very kind, even when I asked stupid things (like not realising one had to lick the stamps from the machine rather than peel them). I didn't find a huge difference between older and younger people, but the only older people I really met were the family I stayed with in Munich for two weeks, they were very nice though.

Honestly just be polite, and try to learn German and others will be polite too. I wish I could speak better German as that was the greatest difficulty for me, as people often speak German to eachother forgetting that you cannot understand, and you can't just demand they always speak English really.

On the other things, you'll never get used to the pillows :P I found the milk okay after a while though, and even got used to the German tea.

La burbuja inmobiliaria, por ejemplo, fué directamente provocada por políticas que incantivaban ese sector como el motor de la economía española. Yo creo que es hora de hacer recortes, y muchos, pero lo primero que se tijeretan son servicios públicos que atentan directamente contra los más valioso que produgieron tantos años de bonanza económica. Existen alternativas, pero parece que muchos están decididos que ya nos merecemos derechos laborales y servicios que tardamos tanto en conseguir.

Ahora, cuando trato este tema con amigos más pasionados con el tema de la huelga y tirar a todos los políticos a un pozo, me encuentro con mucho dogma y poco entendimiento sobre cuanto realmente cuestan las cosas, y sobre cuanto creen control que tiene el gobierno sobre los mercados. 

Se niegan a tomar en cuenta que el trabajo lo crean otros españoles que crean servicios o productos que *alguien* tiene que comprar. Que comprándose ordenadores con sus amigos que vienen de USA a menores precios, España no recibe nada por esa compra. Que por mucho que odien pagar por entretenimiento, cada vez que piratean películas, juegos o música que **sí** podrían permitirse, le niegan un ingreso al estado y a una empresa generando empleo.

Und wenn er sich darüber aufregt, das nicht mehr so viele Leute bei den Plattenfirmen arbeiten wie vor zehn, fünfzehn Jahren, dann liegt das nicht an Youtube oder illegalen downloads. Sony, EMG hatten letztes Jahr das profitabelste ihrer Musikgeschichte. Es ist auch unwahr zu sagen, das Youtube nicht für die Klicks bezahlen will. Nur weil die GEMA eine exorbitant hohe Summe fordert, ist Youtube hierzu nicht bereit. Er scheint irgendwie auch nicht zu merken, das es eine unglaubliche Werbung ist, wenn sein neues Video 15millionen mal angeklickt wird. Für so was wird normalerweise bezahlt, durch Plakatwerbung etc. Es ist eine Dienstleistung auf beiden Seiten.

Leute sind bereit für gute Musik Geld zu bezahlen. Viele Menschen sind aber nicht mehr dazu bereit, für ein Album mit 2 guten Liedern 15€ zu bezahlen, diese dann noch nicht einmal auf ihren iPod rüberspielen können und dann auch noch von den Plattenfirmen als Dumme Teenies bezeichnet zu werden. iTunes hat doch wunderbar vorgezeigt, das wenn ein besseres Geschäftsmodell entlang kommt, die Leute durchaus bereit sind dafür zu zahlen.

Außerdem, wenn er sagt das die RockNRoll leute für jeden Euro arbeiten müssen, kann das wahr sein. Das aber bei einer verkauften CD mit einem Preis von 12 Euro nur ungefähr 50cent and die Band gehen, verschweigt er dabei. Der Rest geht nämlich an Plattenfirmen, Promoter etc. Wenn man eine Band wirklich unterstützen will, sollte man zu den Konzerten gehen, T-shirts kaufen oder ihnen sogar Geld spenden, nicht aber das Album bei Saturn/Mediamarkt kaufen. Von dem Geld sehen die nämlich so gut wie gar nichts. 

Also tut mir leid, Sven Regener, wenn ich so asozial bin und nicht bereit bin, für ein gutes Lied 15€ jedes Mal auf den Tisch zu legen.

Ich finde es immer ein bisschen problematisch, wenn man Menschen, die ja offensichtlich den Drang haben, diese Kunst zu konsumieren (eine CD zu hören oder ein Buch zu lesen) dämonisiert und abstraft, anstatt andere Möglichkeiten (die es offensichtlicht gibt) der Verbreitung zu finden. Dies ist ja auch gar nicht von den Künstlern ausgehend, die weitgehend die Kontrolle über ihre eigenen Aufnahmen verlieren, sobald sie bei einem Plattenlabel unterschreiben, sondern von den Konzernen.

I'm German and I have a mixed opinion on that matter. For one part I'm even proud on our film industry (or whatever is in charge of dubbing movies and shows) to be able to dub foreign movies/shows.

But I wish there were more possibilties to watch movies with their original dub, because some movies are just full of sayings or puns that you can't translate that well. Or it just doesn't sound real. I haven't heard a good german dub of an Afro-American. Not because the voice is bad or poorly chosen (the German voice actor for Morgan Freeman does an excellent job IMO) but because it sounds ingenuine.

It's like an American wants to dub a Bavarian. It wouldn't work very well.

true,Sloeb,null,null,"Born 1966, visited in 1987 as part of an intensive German language program from my University.
We partnered from our uni in Iowa, USA with one in Klagenfurt, Austria.
After the semester ended, I stayed in Europe and spent the summer traveling largerly in the Deutschsprachraum (everywhere from Tyrol to Hamburg). 
My memories of German speaking people (the cultures don't vary as much as the individual people you meet might, so I'm throwing you all in together from Zurich to Berlin) are of friendly, helpful people. I was treated with respect, love, patience and great interest/curiosity. 

In the dorms, we were all students together. I had an Austrain girlfriend and a close circle of Austrian friends. They often had their own misperceptions which I hope happen less frequently now with the internet. For example, we were in a student bar when another immigrant student came in who was from Africa. My hosts all became agitated and wanted to gently let me know that someone of color was in the same facility as I was. As if, I were going to suddenly pull out a KKK robe and start burning the place at the site of an African person. 

While traveling, I came across a drunk farmer trying to mow hay and I helped him attach equipment to the tractor. Then he paid me with a beer warmed by the motor. He was great. 

I met hippies in a park in Vienna who kept me stoned all night as they showed me the exotic parts of the city. I have distant cousins of my immigrant ancestors in some villages along the Weser who gave me a place to do laundry and sleep in a decent bed. While in a car with some other Americans who got lost in Frankfurt and drove the wrong way down a one-way street, a lady getting out of work came and walked behind the car as we drove in reverse to make it back up to a regular street. 

The Germans I met were great and friendly people. They had questions and might have had some silly ideas, but I know plenty of Americans who think silly things about people in Europe. I know there were some people who didn't like Americans, especially with Reagan threatening nuclear war back then. But they kept to themselves and left me alone or kept their opinions largely civil. We had some heated debates and discussions in the dorms, but it was among friends. 

There was one time on a train when an elderly drunk began singing and doing the Nazi salute - and the awkward and pained expressions on everyone's face was very obvious. I think the whole train was ashamed that I was witnessing that. The more people hissed at him, the louder he got. And in Berlin, I must have done something wrong. The Stasi border guards denied me passage into East Berlin. No explanation, but they just declined my toll, handed me back my passport and said to try another day.

I would have loved to have stayed forever.

Super friendly; Great stories of living in Canada. He hung out with us for quite a while. [picture of the guy](http://www.wix.com/cswalker/family-vaycay#!more-family/photostackergallery3=9). He's wearing the green suit. Also, met a group of young professionals after the WinterMacht. Still chat with some of them every now and then. 

I chatted up a little kid who was getting impatient in a store waiting for his mom. I was feeling the same waiting for all the people I was with. He blew me away with German. I could barely keep up. He thought it was funny how badly I communicated. All walks of life were a blast to meet and get together with.

I loved every minute of my journey. I became instant best friends with the people I met. This is a rare thing for me, as I'm mostly an introvert (funny you mentioned Germans as introverts). I did notice that my interest in communicating (at least attempting to) made a lot more people more excited and forthcoming. 

The only thing I disliked: We daily bought a ton of tickets for the train. We constantly split up, but always tried to manage tickets properly. One night we ended up a 1 person short of our tickets (a few group splits/mergin between ~20 people can get confusing). It was an incredible fine. We were literally at our stop when the agent popped us. You live you learn I guess. ",0,1332456157,null,0,false,0,c43w9pm,t3_r8ay1,t1_c43w9pm,t3_r8ay1,null,1428575648,6,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,6

When: Now (September 2011 - ?) 

Where: Living in Freiburg, have been all over the place

From: St. Louis, Missouri, USA

German?: I like to think I'm rather good at German. I can understand basically 100% and speak fairly well. 

I find that people are incredibly receptive. This probably has a lot to do with the fact that Freiburg is very much a university town with tens of thousands of students. But I frequently find myself talking with strangers (waitresses, people in the park, people at restaurants, whatever) who are interested in where I'm from and what I'm doing in Germany. I get along very well with everyone in my WG. In 2008, during the heat of the American election, everyone's first question was, ""Do you support Obama?"" and if you answered yes, they would be as nice as can be. Since Obama's election, I haven't had the experience of people bringing up America's foreign policy as much. 

A few of the cultural differences I find more amusing than anything. Germans are incapable of doing what you might call ""going with the flow."" If something is not working as it should be, Germans don't understand how to react. Say there's a broken traffic light; Americans would quickly realize it was broken and simply ignore it by treating it light a stop sign. Germans, I feel like, would freak out, and probably have to call up the police and 100 different bureaucratic Ämter before they could do anything. On the same line, Germans are serious about ""Bei Rot stehen bleiben."" It could be 2 am, with no cars in sight for 10 miles in either directions, and Germans will dutifully stand at the crosswalk, waiting for a green light. 

There's definitely a difference between older and younger people, but I don't necessarily think that older people are more anti-American. If anything, the opposite may be the case, but younger people are much more open and engaging that older people for a number of reasons. First off, young people are just naturally so. People younger than 50 or so usually have a pretty good amount of exposure to American culture through film and television and everything, and are thus pretty open to it. But with the Internet, it's just a whole new ballgame. I've experienced this in all countries throughout Europe, not just Germany. I think that most European students, as well as a certain subset of American students (namely the type of student who wants to go spend a year abroad, rather than party in frat houses back home), are really more ""world citizens"" than anything. They're ready and willing to engage with all sorts of people, language and nationality barriers be damned. But I've never experienced rudeness or reproach from older people; being in Baden, the biggest problem is that I can't understand them half the time because, as we know, the people of Baden-Württemberg können alles außer Hochdeutsch.

Interestingly, though, the most heartwarming instance of Gastfreundschaft I've ever seen, either in the US or abroad, was from a 77 year old German man named Jürgen. Here's the story: An American friend and I wanted to see some live music, so we looked up a local events calendar and found several options. We decided against going to one of the bigger clubs or venues with bigger acts and decided to go to this small Italian place where somebody was going to be playing boogie woogie and blues piano. When we got there, the place was, much to our surprise, completely packed. There was no room at all, so we went outside to smoke a cigarette while we weighed our options. 

This old dude walks outside and lights up a cigarette, and eventually we strike up a conversation. He tells us how he spent years in America and he loves Americans, and he wants us to come inside and listen to this pianist, with whom Jürgen was good friends. We tell him there's no room, but he offers us seats at his own table. We go in there and sat amongst his wife and friends, and listened to this amazing pianist. In between songs, Jürgen would tell us about his adventures; he'd worked in Manhattan and Texas and South Africa and even Antarctica. He told us about the value of hard work. He told us about how when he was 10 years old, his family was starving as the National Socialists tried to hold out against the inevitable. Eventually, the Americans busted through, and Jürgen told us that the first proper thing he had to eat in days was a chocolate bar given to him by a black American soldier. He told us about all the great experiences he's had around the world, and that the basic message he wanted to tell us, so that we might share it with others, is that we all need to love and care about each other, regardless of race or nationality or religion. Then, at the end of the night, he insisted on buying our meals and drinks. It really was an amazing night, the kindest act of hospitality I've ever experienced, and I'll always think about Jürgen's kindness and generosity when I think back on my times here in Germany.

EU employs lots and lots of people but unless we get to the exact numbers, it's a pointless debate.

Your ""net recipient"" argument is used very much in here by federalists, eurofanatics, whatever we call them. Don't you see it's wrong? Those are not some magic money, those are money of other member states. In future, we would be net contributors. Simply the system of sending money over to Brussels and then asking them back for some ""projects"" - which some of them may be good, but some of them are crazy and stupid, as well - is just without any sense. I strongly suggest that you read through what i.e. European Social Fund supports. Because I did my research, I did my job in here. This also brings more bureaucrats. I don't want to support bureaucrats and/or those projects with my taxes.


&gt; That's actually your (Klaus') and your colleagues' achievement: you don't want to strengthen the common institutions like the parliament which would eliminate the need for all these intergouvernamental conferences.

I don't want the EU at all. And if so, I'm for staying outside of it. I don't want a parliament on a European level. A huge democratic deficit is there. People can't vote and shouldn't elect governments outside their countries, there's no European identity as there was no Soviet identity. They tried to indoctrinate us with both here in Czech.


&gt; A common market needs common rules.

Of course, but there should be minimum of them restricting businesses. They should actually support them (well, mostly not over-regulating them would be enough). Subsidization is no common rule, that's just pure corruption. I don't need standardized bananas, eggs, sweets, etc. I don't want to throw uot sugar because the amount of it is regulated. If you believe in central planning, you're simply a very strong socialist, my friend.


&gt; And this doesn't even address the fact that he denies anthropogenic climate change, which should be a red flag to everyone. It's scientific consensus.

1. There is no scientific consensus. You make me think again that you just watch mainstream TV.

2. If there was a consensus, I thought that science is not about voting but about the actual facts. Some of Czechs wanted to prove our history on around 19th/20th century by faking historical documents. And they had historians consensus. Our first Czechoslovak president T. G. Masaryk was against it and the mainstream media were extremely rude in their texts. Yet, it was discovered he was right. Science was never about consensus.

3. You haven't read anything from Klaus regarding climate change. He questions it and thinks about it economically and politically.

4. It's not just a question for scientists. Those Green neo-marxist parties want to change the way we live and to change our laws. They want us to give up some of our freedoms. That has to be done at some price, which is to create some new restrictions, regulations, laws, etc., which is - that's the most important - a political question. And none other than political.

So far, I'm happy to see ppl stopping their belief in man made climate change. As one of my favorite thinkers said: **""An absurd fiction about the acute danger of global ecological self-destruction of mankind.""**


If you are Green or Socialist or a strong Federalist, I'm fine with that, just say that so that I don't argue with you about it here.

To elaborate even more, our centre-left party (Labour) is so close to the centre that our centre-right parties (Fianna Fail, Fine Gael; Fine Gael is slightly right of FF, which is so populist it will do anything to get votes (like if Mitt Romney was an Irish political party)) have little problem being in coalition with them and they don't have to sacrifice their positions a huge amount. 

From my perspective, what this means is that the three largest parties are functionally so similar that a vote for one of them is a vote for any of them, and more often than not it is the personalities of the party members and the party history, and not the policies, which people vote on (this is especially true for FG and FF).

The further south you go, the friendlier people tend to be - and in general, outside of Paris people are considerably less stressed and considerably more open to making new acquaintances.

The biggest advice I can give is to **go to local concerts**.  It provides the perfect venue within which to make friends, and will be filled with young university kids who are open to meeting a random foreigner and would be proud to show you how much that they love the city.  Often smaller shows will be filled with friends of the band who have seen them play hundreds of times and would be eager to talk to someone new.  Furthermore, people at shows come in groups, have a few drinks, get split up, and are often loitering around the bar or out front having a clope, often in twos or even alone.  Introduce yourself or ask a question around the bar or out front.  Ask for a light if you're a smoker, or say you're American, just showed up, and would love a recommendation for cool bars or cafés to check out.  Mention wanting to practice your French, and 9 times out of 10 people will at least entertain a brief conversation with you.  After a few minutes, another of their friends will stumble into the fray and you will be introduced to the wider friend group they came with, and now you can move on to talking with the others to keep the conversation from going stale.  Eventually someone will offer a phone number or suggest that you facebook each other, and boom, you've got a friend group to latch onto.

As an added bonus, it's completely normal to go to a concert alone, so there's no need to feel socially awkward doing so as you might if you went to a bar or café solo and tried to intrude into friend groups that are loitering.

I love Deutschland. You have great food most of the time. Your beer rules. You have awesome architecture. Your energy infrastructure is becoming more and more renewable, just the opposite of what is happening to us here in the US, where we are becoming more and more dependent on oil and gasoline and natural gas and still coal even. 

you have great music. Your culture is awesome, especially when it comes to traditional stuff. We don't have ""traditional"" clothing in the US. Unless you count like.. cowboy outfits of the wild west, or maybe pilgrim shit. I love fucking lederhosen. I wish I would have bought an outfit when I was there. 

I studied in Salzburg for 10 weeks 2 springs ago and visited Muenchen, Berlin, Hannover, and saw Hamburg for 2 hrs, as well as Wien and I lived in Salzburg. So I was kind of all over.

What I liked best:
Beer
Food
Culture and traditions (love staring people down when I prost)
Awesome architecture
All around nice and good-natured people
Awesome coffee
Great restaurants, bars, biergartens, and nightlife in most cities.

what I liked least:
I had 1 experience when some of my American friends and I were harrassed by a couple Austrian teenagers in a Mcdonalds late at night. We were drunk. They were more drunk. They started mooning us. Throwing shit at us. So we left and started walking home. They chased us down in their car and kept mooning us and throwing bottles from their car at us. We didn't want to start shit, but we just got home and drank ourselves to sleep.
- another time, my black friend was yelled at on a bus in Salzburg by an elderly woman.. ""kein Schwarz! Kin Schwarz!"" she yelled. We told her to shut the fuck up. not exactly a nice experience though.
- Sometimes, people didn't take kindly to us Americans going places where typical germans go. One night, we went to the Augustiner Beerhalle in Muenchen. We had 10 or so people with us, mostly Americans. We all spoke basic to intermediate German. We walked in the entrance, and they told us there wasn't any room for us, and if we wanted to stay, we had to sit outside. This was a week before easter, and it was kind of cold outside. We ended up all getting ein Mas bier and sat out front. We were the only ones outside. I had a feeling she just didn't want us in there because we were Americans or something. Maybe I'm wrong, but I hated getting shit for being a tourist, even when we kept our touristyness to a minimum and spoke german almost the whole time. I ended up stealing the menu when we left because I was drunk and mad.
- I hated getting harassed by homeless or very low-wage workers who would either beg for money, or throw old magazines in my hand to try and make me pay for them. I could handle it, but it really upset one of my friends one time, and he just gave the kid with the magazines 5 euro to get away from us. 
- Didn't like the anti-immigrant attitude I felt in places. I damn loved Kebaps and I will forever hold Haci's Kebap in Salzburg in my heart. Everyone has immigration problems, but I never felt that just keeping people out was the best way to handle them. To me, it felt like the germans just wanted to keep germany for themselves and not let anyone non-German live there.

- So in all. I disliked the somewhat anti-tourist attitude in touristy places we went, anti-immigration sentiment in many places.. in the south especially, and in Oesterreich, and I didn't like being harassed by drunks for being American.

true,Bardaf,Zbelleile,Belle-Île,"Bon, allez, je tente de donner mon point de vue, de Franco-Français, gauchiste convaincu, qui pourtant pense que ça va mal.

Oui, selon moi il y a un problème avec l'immigration en France, mais ce n'est pas un problème qui date d'aujourd'hui, il date des débuts mêmes de l'immigration en France. Lors de l'arrivée des premiers immigrés, et quelle que soit la raison, je ne cherche pas à tomber dans les vieux marronniers, les Français ont eu un peu de mal avec ces gens aux couleurs de peaux un peu foncées qui venaient s'installer à côté de chez eux, parce que le racisme à l'époque c'était complètement normal. Au fur et à mesure des années, les trente glorieuses arrivent à leur fin, de plus en plus d'immigrés sont arrivés, etc, et le racisme n'a pas beaucoup reculé, alors l'intégration est toujours aussi difficile pour les immigrés avec qui on ne se mélange toujours que très peu et qu'on commence même à diaboliser parce que s'il commence à y avoir du chômage, c'est forcément à cause d'eux, ma bonne dame. Dans cette ambiance pour le moins joviale et sympathique entre Français d'origine et nouvellement Français, naissent les enfants d'immigrés sur le sol Français et dont on ne peut disputer la nationalité. 

C'est bien là qu'est le drame : cette génération dans sa majeure partie ne se sent pas forcément Française.

La plupart de ces enfants mettront en avant la nationalité de leurs parents plutôt que la leur, pour plusieurs raisons que je vois de mon côté :

1) Des enfants qui dès la cour d'école subissent le racisme des blancs (ça va en s'amenuisant mais sur la première génération on peut dire que c'est carrément foiré) s'ils sont à l'école à leur côté, ou l'impossibilité de voir des ""Français de souche"" (je déteste cette expression rien que pour le site qui la reprend) parce que le quartier est un ghetto et l'école n'accueille que des enfants d'immigrés, font qu'il est difficile de se forger une identité française à la base. L'école républicaine échouant dans sa mission à ce niveau (et là on peut blâmer la droite comme la gauche).

2) Voir ses parents subir eux même le racisme, les voir cantonnés à des métiers de second ordre, et donc ne pas forcément faire l'apologie de la France à leurs enfants, ça n'aide pas non plus à se donner une bonne image de son pays et à se forger une identité.

3) Le principe très franco-français de cracher sur ses symboles et son pays à moins qu'il ne gagne une coupe du monde de Football ou soit à deux doigts de l'emporter ne donne pas forcément l'exemple. les guerres de clochers inter-régionales, la mise en avant de son identité régionale (Bretons, Corses, Basques en première ligne, tous les autres juste derrière) avant celle de son pays, ça ne peut aussi qu'inciter ceux qui ont des origines diverses à les mettre en avant pour se mettre à la hauteur, puisque de toutes évidence, on ne peut jamais s'entendre sur le fait qu'on est simplement Français.

Les conséquences variées du rejet de l'identité française ?

- Des jeunes qui fêtent la victoire de l'Algérie en cramant des bagnoles à Paris après un match France-Algérie, alors qu'ils sont nés en France et sont donc Français.

- Un racisme qui a changé de camp parce qu'après un long travail sur l'évolution des mentalités, les blancs commencent à voir les gens comme des individus et pas comme un groupe qui serait à lui seul au centre de tous les malheurs. De l'autre côté le racisme anti-blanc a augmenté pour les raisons invoquées plus haut.

- Le phénomène ""Kaïra"" qui touche n'importe quelle couleur de peau dès lors qu'on subit la mauvaise influence d'une ou deux petites frappes en puissance.

- Et enfin dans le cas qui nous préoccupe suite à l'actualité, une poussée religieuse inquiétante chez certains, des [simples poussées traditionalistes](http://www.europe1.fr/Faits-divers/Agresse-car-sa-femme-vit-a-la-francaise-604703/) jusqu'au terrorisme dans le cas de l'affaire de Toulouse. Je ne m'étendrai pas plus sur la religion bien qu'elle soit souvent une constante évoquée par les médias, mais tous les musulmans que je connais ne sont pas très portés sur la religion et je pense que les dérives ne sont pas si importantes, mon regard est peut-être biaisé, mais je reste persuadé que la plupart des gens qui sont partis de certains pays où la religion les oppressait n'ont pas envie de reproduire le même schéma en France et auront pris soin de mettre en garde leurs enfants.

Bref, tout ça pour dire qu'en tant qu'homme de gauche je ne suis pas de ceux qui disent que tout est rose, il ne faut pas se voiler la face et refuser de voir les problèmes quand il y en a. Malgré tout, je ne vois pas vraiment de solution, je pense que seul le temps pourra arranger les choses, nous ne sommes pas en guerre civile ou pris à la gorge par des milices de conversion à l'Islam radical, la situation n'est donc pas désespérée.

Il y a en France des lois qui prévoient déjà la répression des propos violents, menaçants, racistes etc, etc. Nul besoin de créer une nouvelle loi.

Si une volonté de fichage est derrière tout cela, direction le conseil constitutionnel.


Petit exemple pratique du casse tête à propos de la Loi relative à la protection de l'identité :
&gt;L'article 5 de cette loi prévoyait la création d'un traitement de données à caractère personnel facilitant le recueil et la conservation des données requises pour la délivrance du passeport français et de la carte nationale d'identité. Parmi celles-ci, figurent, outre l'état civil et le domicile du titulaire, sa taille, la couleur de ses yeux, deux empreintes digitales et sa photographie. L'article 10 permettait aux agents des services de police et de gendarmerie nationales d'avoir accès à ce traitement de données à caractère personnel, pour les besoins de la prévention et de la répression de diverses infractions, notamment celles liées au terrorisme. 

&gt;le Conseil constitutionnel a examiné l'ensemble des caractéristiques du fichier. En premier lieu, il est destiné à recueillir des données relatives à la quasi-totalité de la population française. En deuxième lieu, parmi les données enregistrées dans ce fichier, les données biométriques, notamment les empreintes digitales, sont particulièrement sensibles. En troisième lieu, les caractéristiques techniques de ce fichier permettent son interrogation à d'autres fins que la vérification de l'identité d'une personne. En quatrième lieu, la loi déférée autorise la consultation ou l'interrogation de ce fichier non seulement aux fins de délivrance ou de renouvellement des titres d'identité et de voyage et de vérification de l'identité du possesseur d'un tel titre, mais également à d'autres fins de police administrative ou judiciaire.

&gt;Eu égard à la nature des données enregistrées, à l'ampleur de ce traitement, à ses caractéristiques techniques et aux conditions de sa consultation, le Conseil constitutionnel a jugé que l'article 5 de la loi déférée a porté au droit au respect de la vie privée une atteinte qui ne peut être regardée comme proportionnée au but poursuivi. Il a en conséquence censuré les articles 5 et 10 de la loi déférée et par voie de conséquence, le troisième alinéa de l'article 6, l'article 7 et la seconde phrase de l'article 8.

&gt;Par ailleurs, le Conseil constitutionnel a examiné l'article 3 de la loi qui conférait une fonctionnalité nouvelle à la carte nationale d'identité. Cet article ouvrait la possibilité que cette carte contienne des « données » permettant à son titulaire de mettre en oeuvre sa signature électronique, ce qui la transformait en outil de transaction commerciale. Le Conseil a relevé que la loi déférée ne précisait ni la nature des « données » au moyen desquelles ces fonctions pouvaient être mises en oeuvre ni les garanties assurant l'intégrité et la confidentialité de ces données. La loi ne définissait pas davantage les conditions d'authentification des personnes mettant en oeuvre ces fonctions, notamment pour les mineurs. Le Conseil a en conséquence jugé que la loi, faute de ces précisions, avait méconnu l'étendue de sa compétence. Il a censuré l'article 3 de la loi.

Menos población = mayor facilidad de gestión. Por eso estoy en contra de la supresión de las autonomías y más en favor de un estado federal.

Está claro que estos dos gráficos están correlados:

- [Boom de la construcción](http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/2011/12/19/1149502282.htm)

- [Boom de la población española](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7zGZY4Sjjhs/TbFvgpLqJ5I/AAAAAAAAAYI/b1cyK5hyPcY/s1600/Evoluci%25C3%25B3n+de+la+poblaci%25C3%25B3n+grafico.jpg)

Es decir:

1. Del 1982 al 2008 la población española creció casi 10 millones.
2. Entre el mínimo y el máximo de ocupación de la gráficasobre la construcción hay una diferencia de 6 millones de personas.

Para mi esta fluctuación de 6 millones es ""menos grave"" si la comparamos con un crecimiento demográfico de 10 millones durante el mismo periodo.

Por lo tanto concluyo que uno de los mayores problemas de la crisis es que hay mucha gente para pocos recursos. También opino que el boom de la construcción ha sido causado más por ese aumento demográfico que por una malvada voluntad política. La voluntad política simplemente aprovechó la coyuntura, lo cual agravó el problema (más bonanza económica = más augmento demográfico).
