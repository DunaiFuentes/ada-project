That being said, they didn't go out of their way to help me either. I have friends whose employers took care of the whole process from A to Z. That was not my case. 

The process was simple in the sense that it was straightforward, but involved multiple visits to the prefecture that could sometimes take the whole day. (As a foreigner it's not uncommon that a big part of your paid vacation days are spent on prefecture processes).

The only thing that'd qualify as BS they put me through was to (re)send me to the doctor. You need a ""visite medicale"" in order for the ""changement de statut"" be approved.

About the horror stories, I heard them as well, and here's what I know. Something called ""Circulaire Gueant"" (probably a law) was given to all the prefectures in France and started being applied in June 2011. That was the source of the horror stories you heard.

I also know that one of Hollande's (the president, not the country) first orders of business was to cancel that ""circulaire"" which he deemed far too unfair to foreigners (like us).

true,TarantusaurusRex,null,null,"I lived in Paris last year. When I arrived, I didn't know anyone, and I didn't know how to make any friends.  I'm typically a very peppy and social person, but over the winter I was VERY depressed.  At one point, I didn't leave my apartment for 2 weeks straight, except to go to the Franprix just outside my building.  Once.  And I remember that I had to convince myself to go back out for hours.  I've never been so blue in my life, I felt very lonely and unlike myself. 

You know what I did?  I made some muffins and invited anyone from /r/paris to come hang out with me along Canal St. Martin. And you know what? People showed up!  And I met people who became my best friends, who were really kind and wonderful folks. And I met my boyfriend through those friends.  When I was depressed, I couldn't wait to move back to the States, but now I live in Lyon, France and I couldn't be happier!  And now I feel more secure in my friend-making abilities, so I don't feel hopeless and alone. 

Please don't hesitate to contact your fellow Paris redditors, you're not the only one who has felt that way, trust me! 

P.S. It's not at Bastille, but you might enjoy Restaurant Sésame, located at 51 Quai de Valmy in the 10th.  It is a New York-style café with free wifi and a really nice, comfortable, relaxed environment. Before 11 a.m., you can get a hot drink, a mini smoothie and a muffin/cookie/fromage blanc for only 5 euros.  The baristas are welcoming and speak English, it was my favorite morning spot when I wanted to take my laptop out of the apartment.  

Another great place is Adèle's Family (67 Rue d'Argout), an American café/épicerie where you can get a filter coffee with free refills, bagels, and other American items for pretty low prices.  It's tiny, but it's off the main path and usually uncrowded but the people are also very nice there. I met my lady-friends there on Sunday mornings.  

OH OH and if you want GOOD refillable filter coffee, probably the best in Paris next to Caféotheque but with a better atmosphere, stop by Sugarplum Cake Shop (68 Rue du Cardinal Lemoine), where everyone speaks English and the baristas are American. They are VERY nice and cheery, always happy to chat, and the atmosphere is very warm.  There is a lot of seating, and they have lots of delicious goodies like cakes, cupcakes, muffins, etc. 

Keep yourself busy.  Busy busy busy! Not necessarily with work, but with exploring, activities, sports, whatever.  Develop new hobbies, join a gym, a book club, a weekend rugby/softball/soccer team, there are so many things to do in Paris (everyone says that, and it can be hard to find them for an expat but they exist). Most importantly, find ways to exercise. If you don't like going to the gym or typical exercise, then just explore the city by foot in your free time. That is what I did--I frequently went to Montmartre to give myself a workout on the stairs and hills. Take up cycling or rollerblading.

Josip Friscic, ehemaliger Vizepräsident des kroatischen Parlaments und ehemaliger Parteipräsident der Kroatischen Bauernpartei (HSS), des Koalitionspartners der Kroatischen Demokratischen Union (HDZ) in der Vorgängerregierung, sagte heute vor dem Gericht in Zagreb als Zeuge im Prozess gegen den der Korruption beschuldigten ehemaligen Premierminister Ivo Sanader aus, **dass** er mit Sanader **nie** über den kroatischen Energiekonzern INA und die ungarische Ölfirma MOL gesprochen hat.

Friscic bestätigte, dass er Ende 2008 an einer Koalitionsrunde teilgenommen hat, in der der damalige Vizepremierminister Damir Polancec über die Probleme im Energiesektor sprach**,** sowie über die Schwierigkeiten im Energiekonzern INA und die Veränderungen in seiner Eigentümerstruktur, zu denen es kam, nachdem MOL fast 50 Prozent der INA-Aktien gekauft hatte. Ein weiteres Thema war **die** potenzielle Ausgliederung des Gasgeschäfts aus INA.

Sanader sei aber bei der Sitzung nicht anwesend gewesen, so Friscic. Mit ihm soll der ehemalige Premierminister diese Themen weder vor der Sitzung**,** noch danach besprochen haben**,** oder darauf insistiert haben.

Soweit es Friscic bekannt sei, habe Sanader auch die zwei HSS-Minister in seiner Regierung, Bozidar Pankretic und Damir Bajs, nie dazu gezwungen, im Januar 2009 für die Änderungen im Aktionärsvertrag mit der Ölfirma MOL zu stimmen, die so die Entscheidungsrechte in INA übernommen hat.

Laut der kroatischen Behörde zur Bekämpfung von Korruption und organisierter Kriminalität (USKOK) habe Sanader von MOLs Chefs für die Überlassung dieser Rechte an den ungarischen Ölkonzern 10 Millionen Euro Schmiergeld erhalten.

""Ich glaube, dass niemand Druck auf die Minister ausübte. Sonst hätten sie es mir auch gesagt.""**,** so Frišcic.

Der ehemalige HSS-Präsident fügte hinzu, dass Polancec über die Probleme mit der Gaslieferung wegen der Krise zwischen Russland und der Ukraine**,** sowie über die Notwendigkeit der Sicherung der Gasversorgung und damit auch der energetischen Stabilität Kroatiens sprach. Weiterhin redete er über die Veränderungen in der Eigentümerstruktur des Konzerns INA und die Probleme aufgrund hoher Verluste im Gasgeschäft, **den** Mangel an Lagerkapazitäten und **die** Notwendigkeit, zwei zusätzliche Gasspeicher zu bauen**,** wie auch über die eventuelle Notwendigkeit der Erhöhung von Gaspreisen oder der Ausgliederung **des** Gasgeschäfts **von** INA an das Unternehmen Plinacro.",0,1348564534,null,0,false,0,c6d4epn,t3_10f4lm,t1_c6d4epn,t3_10f4lm,null,1429985988,2,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,2

1. people who want to restore USSR, most of them born after the collapse and have never been even close to Russia. People who organize huge drinking parties, wave Soviet flags paints their BMW's and Mercedese's with red stars and slogans:""To Berlin!"" each 9th of May, goes raping, robbing and doing stupid stuff. Those are elected into parliament.

2. Then the other side: those who are fed up and still are too patriotic for nowadays, people who like to wave their flag and want to remember the horror of both world wars, genocide, honouring the local Latvian warriors from both sides - White riflemen (Read SS 15th and 19th Legionnaire division) and Red Riflemen (Read Red army Latvians), both recruited by force.

Now imagine both parties being populist and both main objective is appear better than another, provoke each other, be hostile and waving their own flags, calling other uneducated bigots to arms. That's the politics. 

In reality, the capital is 50/50 Russians and Latvians and until recent radical parties, we have lived in a peace and crimes halted. Now it goes back to normal and still we have friends. I have spent all my childhood with Russian friends, all my teen years with Latvians and now I have the ebst of both worlds. The most educated and tolerant friends from either sides do not like to talk about politics and considers both parties crazy people. Many understand that patriotism and nostalgia does not matter now. We all are in this together and we will accomplish nothing by fighting each other. Unfortunately, the politicians and their narrow minded followers do not understand that.

People themselves choose if they want to be friendly towards each other and we have no problem communicating each in his own language, because we understand each other. Others who listen Kremlin's lies, Baltic Russian news propaganda or local national populist slogans are not worthy our time. Enforcing your opinions won't work. Be tolerant and kind to every person despite anything he says, believes, does or acts. That is way to go.

The radicals and politicians do not represent our culture, the people and what we want.

It's very important to understand that you can't (and do not) steal something what you lived and died for a millennium. Hungarians built pretty much everything there from their ""own"" resources (towns, roads, trains, churches, schools, theaters, etc, everything), and most importantly, they are the ones who were died defending that land for centuries, so successive generations literally died in battles and wars defending Transylvania while Romania only gained authority ~90 years ago (with an obligatory full autonomy, which they ignored from day one).

I expect my government to do the same, to be prudent, and ask questions on why, where how. *If* they do not, they are not doing a good job. And, the EU should be able to answer that, extensively. I do not think the EU has good enough explanations to where all the previous money has gone, nor why such a large part should be CAP etc. Thus, I protest. Are you saying I shouldn't? It might be small cash to you, but it is billions we are talking about. Billions that could be invested in research for example. 

Another thing is, that just handing over money the way the EU has done (I think Greece is a wonderful case in point) it can actually prolong bad practises, since the government get money to cover up for the shortcomings without dealing with the real problems at hand.

&gt;There was no claim for that territory from any entity, country or empire whatsoever, nor was there any force to defend the land against the arriving Hungarians. 

This is beside the point. The Romanians argue for a continuous Romance population there, not a Romanian state of any kind. There could very well have been total anarchy. There could have been later influx of southern Romanians. There could even have been other peoples present tgether with the Romanians (Slavs, Avars, whatever).

&gt;And Romanians were never assimilated (or treated as an enemy) in the whole time, which is proven by the fact that they kept imigrating into Hungary hoping for a better life.

Yes. Being a peasant in Transylvania was many times better than being one in Wallachia. But things were not jolly for Romanians. The Orthodox were considered ""tolerated"" which de facto meant the Romanian population. Also, they were not part of the [three estates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unio_Trium_Nationum) that held political power, which by today's standards is a form of political discrimination.

Also, there was migration out of Transylvania too. One example is a county in Wallachia up until the 19th century named Secuieni, after the Szeklers who settled there. Unfortunately, there's only a [Romanian wiki page](http://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saac).

&gt;Hungarians built pretty much everything there from their ""own"" resources (towns, roads, trains, churches, schools, theaters, etc, everything)

Except for the fact that most towns were built by the German colonists (Saxons). Also, the Habsburgs (when they were still only Austrian, pre-1867) also built some things round here. 

&gt;so successive generations literally died in battles and wars defending Transylvania

And Szekelys died defending Moldavia and Wallachia sometimes. I'm not sure what you are trying to say with this.

&gt;Romania only gained authority ~90 years ago (with an obligatory full autonomy, which they ignored from day one).

Yes, I know. The [Resolution of the Alba Iulia Assembly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alba_Iulia_National_Assembly#Alba_Iulia_National_Assembly) is on Wikipedia (Although many Romanians  forget/don't know about the autonomy part).

I understand that it is an extreme example, but it is a gross and insulting over-reaching of authority. The kind of thing that if it were reversed, the US officials would be crying murder and outrage.

I'm not opposed to the idea of no-fly lists, I'm opposed to the idea that they've become so damn normal! We don't even question them anymore, and the (seemingly) arbitrary ways in which some people are put on them. I'm no conspiracy nut by any means, and I understand measures must be taken for security, but it really feels like you're giving them a finger, and they're taking the whole hand.

In addition the agreement signed with the US (although I am against it, quite strongly so) did not provide competence to the actions taken. One has to wonder if this was an extreme case, or the tip of the iceberg - either way it is unacceptable.

To build upon this I am EXTREMELY uncomfortable with the US authorities being given so much information about me if I were to travel. I am all for privacy, and whilst I do quite trust my own government, I sure as fuck don't what a government that I have no control or say over to have that information unless it is absolutely relevant and pertinent. It's logical that US intelligence monitors people - I'm simply uncomfortable with the ease at which they do so. I want the EU to make it as difficult as bloody possible for them to monitor my life (I'm using myself as an example, exchange that for any other EU citizen if you wish) instead of being so laughably compliant.


I suppose, at the core, what really annoys me about measures such as these is how damned one-sided they are.

Dear friends across Greece, 

Golden Dawn neo-Nazi thugs are harassing and beating migrants, leftists and gay people with almost total impunity -- but together we can stop this spiral of violence and hatred before it destroys the country. 

Fuelled by the economic meltdown, members of the extreme right-wing party are scaling up their hateful and xenophobic attacks, allegedly including deadly assault and murder. Shamefully, the police and the government are turning a blind eye, but a massive public outcry now could trigger a full investigation into Golden Dawn's criminal actions and ensure that tolerance and democracy prevail over fear and fascism. 

Let's move fast -- if enough of us call now on the Council of Europe's Commissioner for Human Rights, we can persuade them to investigate this dark threat to our future and pave the way for strong action against the culprits. Click below to sign the petition to save our democracy and when we reach 20,000 it will be delivered to the Council of Europe's office in Strasbourg. 

https://secure.avaaz.org/en/petition/Investigate_the_Golden_Dawn_neoNazi_Party_of_Greece/?bGAnKcb&amp;v=18126 

Golden Dawn is spreading hate. Their leader was jailed for extreme-right wing terrorism in the 70s, and the party spokesperson and MP allegedly attacked two female left-wing MPs and were never arrested. He also has a trial pending for participating in a stabbing. Other candidates and members of Golden Dawn are also accused of crimes as serious as deadly assault and murder. 

Every day there are allegations and reports in the media of hate crimes against immigrants that are never investigated; intimidation and hate speech that is becoming normalised. Last week they organized a Blood Bank and blood donations ""only for Greeks"", triggering strong reactions among the population. Only by acting together can we start to turn the tide. 

Lets get their actions investigated now before even more people are hurt and our democracy is destroyed. Sign the petition now and forward to everyone: 

https://secure.avaaz.org/en/petition/Investigate_the_Golden_Dawn_neoNazi_Party_of_Greece/?bGAnKcb&amp;v=18126 

With hope and determination,

This is the [slashdot submission](http://slashdot.org/story/12/09/25/004252/plans-for-widespread-monitoring-of-communication-in-europe-revealed) where I heard first about CleanIT (sidenote: what a fantastic name for an EU project, no? Don't we all just want our IT to be clean? What, you don't think so? Terrorist!!!). And here's [the full leaked document](http://www.edri.org/files/cleanIT_sept2012.pdf).

Here's a sample of their ideas. From the scary:

* **Internet companies must allow only real, common names. These must be entered when registering.** (you could argue that this rule is already in place, since signing up for an Internet connection usually requires you to use your real name and address, but the vague nature of the quoted statement could for example mean that *any* kind of anonymous Internet use, like Internet cafes or in libraries, will be outlawed)

* **Social media companies must allow only real pictures of users**

to the plain bizzare:

* **Virtual police officers must be used to show law enforcement is present, is watchful, in order to prevent terrorist use of the Internet and make regular users feel more secure.**

And here's a personal favorite of mine:

* **Governments could implement counter narrative policies and projects**. (or, in other words: tax-funded EU anti-terrorism propaganda. Because nothing helps more against terrorism than manipulation through social media.)

Today was the first time I even heard about CleanIT, so I have really no idea how far this project, which according to the edri.org article is funded by the European Commission, has grown, and how accepted those proposals are by the Commission/the relevant EU politicians. But my take on this is that those proposals are so outlandish that it's probably better to get worked up a bit too early rather than waiting too long until corresponding laws are being passed. What do others make of this?

When I was young I used to work at a ""taverna"" in the summer, we only had glasses and bottled water, if someone would have asked me for tap water I would have been quite in trouble to accomodate such a request because of lack of a proper container.

The Daqo-Roman theory the one which would need a citation, since I don't know about any creditable archaeological, genetic or about any other non-biased evidences available whatsoever. Please don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that it can't be true, but nothing proves it since the first written record we have (Herodotus, 5th century B.C), so it's just one of the theories and it’s something what Romanians learn in school (and perhaps some other nations around the region). As long as you can't prove something with empirical evidence, you have no real science, and History is no exception.
 
.
&gt;Also, are you a Historian?

No, it's more like a hobby of mine. I red lots of books about the history of the region (including some Romanian ones, which I could found translated).

.
&gt;This is beside the point. The Romanians argue for a continuous Romance population there, not a Romanian state of any kind. There could very well have been total anarchy. There could have been later influx of southern Romanians. There could even have been other peoples present tgether with the Romanians (Slavs, Avars, whatever).

I understand, but there are no evidences about a Romance present in the territory in question, while we do have a lot of archeological evidences about Avars, Celts and from all the other groups in that time period. Saying that ""they were together"" is not enough.

.
&gt;Yes. Being a peasant in Transylvania was many times better than being one in Wallachia. But things were not jolly for Romanians. The Orthodox were considered ""tolerated"" which de facto meant the Romanian population. Also, they were not part of the three estates that held political power, which by today's standards is a form of political discrimination.

You can't just apply ""today's standards"" to historical times. I never said that *""things were jolly""* for the Romanians (or for any other ethnic groups). But I do say that things were much better than how things went down elsewhere in the world. Slovaks, Romanians, Croatians, Serbs, Germans, etc they could all use their own languages and cultural customs for the entire time.
I obviously agree that they were not *""equal""*, and indeed, they were forced to learn Latin (or German and Hungarian later) to be able to get higher education or to ""accomplish more"", but let's be honest here, not a single **** would have been given by the world if it had happened otherwise. Slavery, mass murder because of religious differences, or brutaly discriminative laws were common and routine in those times, yet nothing like that happened on a wide scale in Hungary until the great nationalist movements started to spread in Europe and until the infamous Hungarian Nationalities Law which happened as „late” as 1868. 

.
&gt;Except for the fact that most towns were built by the German colonists (Saxons). Also, the Habsburgs (when they were still only Austrian, pre-1867) also built some things round here.

You misunderstood me. The Saxons for example were ""moved"" there by King Géza II of Hungary, and they had privileged status (e.g.: no taxes) just like the Szeklers or the Hungarian Nobles. They were part of the Hungarian Kingdom with their culture and heritage. 
It's a fact that the Ottoman invasion devastated and tore Hungary apart for quite a long time, but that doesn't mean that Transylvania suddenly became Austrian in a cultural or in any other way.

.
&gt;And Szekelys died defending Moldavia and Wallachia sometimes. I'm not sure what you are trying to say with this.

I'm trying to say that *""sometimes""* and *""centuries""* are entirely different things, and they give entirely different basis in an argument about claiming rights in a justifiable and in a moral way. 
The Hungarian Kingdom built insane amount of fortresses, and military outposts in Transylvania to defend the homeland (and Europe) against the eastern empires, and they fought there for centuries. The example might be a bit off, but it’s like if the great wall would be deep inside Mongolian territory today, and the Mongolian nationalist would claim that the Chinese people are trying to *""steal their wall""*... that wouldn't make much of a sense, that's what I'm trying to say.

.
&gt;Also, I don't really care who was first and who came later.

Nor do I. Nationalism is stupid, me thinks:)

Non hai detto dove lei abita.  C'è buon caffè a San Francisco, Portland, Seattle, e New York (forse Chicago, ma non so personalmente).  In altre parti del paese, sia un disastro veramente.  Dopo Starbucks c'è più o meno da niente.  Non abbiamo la cultura di caffè al fuori delle città.  È una vergogna.  (Tra parentesi Starbucks hanno sempre espresso, anche se non lo elenchino nel loro menu.)

true,Bezbojnicul,ROMA,Internetistan,"&gt;I'm trying to say that ""sometimes"" and ""centuries"" are entirely different things, and they give entirely different basis in an argument about claiming rights in a justifiable and in a moral way. The Hungarian Kingdom built insane amount of fortresses, and military outposts in Transylvania to defend the homeland (and Europe) against the eastern empires, and they fought there for centuries.

They give no basis whatsoever. Who fought for what piece of land, or who built the most where are not arguments for claiming rights. Demographics are.

&gt;they were forced to learn Latin (or German and Hungarian later) to be able to get higher education or to ""accomplish more""

And they were also forced to convert to some Western Christian denomination to be able to have a say in politics. But that meant assimilation of the converted one, so they still had no say. There's a reason the national movement in 19th c. Transylvania developed around the Greek-Catholic Romanians, not the Orthodox ones.

&gt;I understand, but there are no evidences about a Romance present in the territory in question, while we do have a lot of archeological evidences about Avars, Celts and from all the other groups in that time period. 

So how does one differentiate latin-speakers from avar-speakers in archeological digs.

Also, how far do Celtic traces extend? Afaik they weren't relevant to the area by the time the Romans left Dacia.

&gt;I don't know about any creditable archaeological, genetic or about any other non-biased evidences available whatsoever.

Wiki mentions some archeological digs: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daco-Romanian_continuity#Arguments_for

I don't know what you mean by the genetic ones

More and more, people honestly want to be different than Spain. Catalonia has always been a bit rebellious, not wanting to participate in skirmishes that they don't need to be involved in, but what really set things off was Franco and his oppression.

Suddenly Catalan started to die out, suddenly the culture started to lose its base and this scared a lot of people, so a revival movement formed. That being said, the patriotism there is only paralleled to the patriotism of Jews in Israel (I've been there too). It's almost frightening how nationalistic the people of Catalonia are, to be honest. They feel they've been and continue to be oppressed by Spain.

1. Support for independence has increased dramatically in the past year or so. It's always been in the 20% range but is higher now. Primarily due to the crisis and all.

2. In the current arrangement, most taxes collected from Catalunya are given to the central government, and then redistributed back to Catalunya at a lower rate. So essentially, a rich region like Catalunya is financially supporting poorer regions. Andalucia, Murcia, etc.   Obviously, this pisses people off.


3. The ""threat"" of succession has been used many times throughout history and hasn't been successful since Catalunya lost independence in 1714. So I can't see much more success this time around. Even with popular support.

Atlantico : En vue du congrès de l’UMP le 18 novembre, vous avez déposé une motion représentant les Humanistes et libéraux dont vous partagez notamment la paternité avec Jean-Pierre Raffarin. Quelles sont vos valeurs et vos propositions ?

Luc Chatel : Nos valeurs sont celles de l'humanisme et du libéralisme. L'un ne va pas sans l'autre, et réciproquement. Notre monde secoué par les guerres et les crises souffre de ne plus respecter assez son humanité ni sa liberté. Comme le disait Einstein : « Nul n'est libre s'il n'est humain, pleinement humain. » Nos propositions visent toutes à réconcilier l'humanité et la liberté. Il faut supprimer les 35h, limiter le droit de grève, assouplir le droit du travail et favoriser partout la flexibilité. Comme le disait Laurence Parisot : « Tout est précaire dans la vie, même l'amour. Alors pourquoi pas le travail ? » Le travail libre dans une économie libre ; des hommes libres dans une société libre ; voilà notre ambition, voilà notre projet !

En quoi votre motion se distingue-t-elle des autres ?

Elle se distingue des autres car elle part d'un point de vue différent pour arriver à des objectifs distincts. Et cela, tout en respectant l'unité et la liberté du mouvement. Nous ne voulons pas nous positionner par rapports aux erreurs passées de Nicolas Sarkozy ni par rapport aux deux candidats actuels qui présentent chacun autant de qualités que de défauts. Il faut rassembler notre mouvement et notre famille autour d'un projet porteur d'espoir et d'avenir. J'aime reprendre cette formule de mon ami Jean-Pierre Raffarin quand il cite le grand sage chinois Lao Tchou : « Pour un village, un puits ; pour une forêt, une rivière. » La division, voilà l'ennemi.

Vous êtes l’une des rares motions à ne pas vous revendiquer du Sarkozysme. Pourquoi ?  

Nous voulons éviter deux écueils dans ce débat et dans cette campagne : la personnalisation et le retour vers le passé. Soyons audacieux ! Tournons nous vers l'avenir, allons de l'avant, et restons unis.

Vous défendez des positions assez centristes dans un parti dont les militants sont plutôt à droite et sont majoritairement favorables à des alliances avec le FN. Ne craignez-vous pas d’être coupé de votre base ?

Ce n'est pas ce que nous dit notre base. Nous faisons de la politique pour défendre des convictions, des idées et un projet, pas pour faire plaisir aux sondeurs ou aux médias.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Catalan here and full disclaimer, I'm a moderate separatist (honestly, I would prefer federalism but in today's Spain I fear that's not possible).

The first thing you should know is that the government won't send in troops, the international backlash would be horrendous. Considering how Spain's economy is at the moment, it needs all the international help it can get.

The reason some people said there could be military involvement is because a couple of retired generals made some threats saying stuff like ""Catalonia will secede over my dead body"" or ""Separatists will face a military trial"", but these threats are as serious as the ""I'm moving to Canada threats"" you might hear in the US.

What I don't rule out is a far-right unionist terrorist group putting a few bombs in Barcelona. I hope the recent memory of ETA dissuades them, but I don't rule it out. And many more ''moderate'' Spanish unionists are saying they will boycott Catalan goods in case of independence (a similar boycott of Catalan goods happened in 2005, but I won't get into that in this post).

As far as how serious it is, I think very much. Recent polls show that 50% of Catalans would vote yes in a referendum for independence. A lot depends on Artur Mas, leader of the centre-right party CiU and current president of Catalonia. CiU has always had a very vague position with respect to Catalan nationalism, most likely in purpose to avoid alienating any voters.

Until recently, Mas's position was to arrange a fiscal pact between Catalonia and the central government so that taxes would be first collected by the Catalan government and then a certain amount sent to Madrid, unlike now where taxes are sent to Madrid first and then distributed among the regions. This is because many catalans feel they are receiving an unfair distribution of funds from the central government. The figure you often see quoted is €16 billion ($20.68 billion) or around 8% of Catalonia's GDP, which is supposedly the amount of tax money that leaves Catalonia but never comes back through government expenditure. This is misleading because it counts central government expenditure as money that never comes back to Catalonia. For example, that money pays for the tax collection agency which Catalonia obviously benefits from even if it's located in Madrid. I've seen figures that in case of independence, Catalonia would have to spend €5 billion ($6.46 billion) more in government expenditure than it does now, meaning it would theoretically benefit by €11 billion. Of course, this is still pure speculation and nobody knows what will really happen economically.

Anyway, the negotiations for a fiscal pact between Mas and the Spanish President Mariano Rajoy didn't fructify, so now there's pressure on Mas to call for a referendum. Instead, today he called for early Catalan regional elections for the 25th of November. The two main Spanish parties -PP (Rajoy's party) and PSOE- are most likely going to plummet, I can't see them getting more than 5% and 15% of the vote respectively. The big winners will be CiU and more clear-cut separatist parties. In this ''light referendum'', if the vote seems to point towards independence there will be immense pressure on Mas to stop fence-sitting and call a referendum. If he does, seeing the economic situation doesn't look like it's going to improve any time soon, the referendum will probably come out for independence. In that case, I can't see Mas trying to be conciliatory and try to get a federal Spain, the hopefully peaceful process towards independence will begin.

TL;DR: It's serious and in my opinion it's going to happen.

*sigh* They were never realistically united. An answer from Yahoo! Answers tells it pretty short and right (I think):

&gt; Portugal is much, much, much older than Spain.

&gt; Portugal, a county run by Henry of Burgundy, a french knight, was turned into a country by his son, Afonso Henriques in 1143.

&gt; Spain only became a country in 1492, almost 350 years AFTER Portugal. To this day ""Spain"" is actually a union of very different kingdoms, some with their own language and culture.

&gt; However, for 60 years, from 1580 to 1640 the two kingdoms were ""united"". 
This was because the portuguese king, the very young Sebastião, died in a battle without heirs. The throne went to the closest cousin which was Philip II of Spain.

Yes, the rise of fascist-like parties in a state of the EU (or any state for that matter) should at least concern the European citizens. GD threat is not overstated. They commit racist crimes on a daily basis and also try to silence, threaten and beat the ones who oppose them. They are slowly creating a small ""dictatorship"" of fear and violence. After the immigrants the persecution of those who they consider not ""pure"" Greek patriots has already begun.

&gt; to be headed by the Greek police, is that what they want?

I guess from Greek authorities, like prosecutors, judges, and police if need be.

&gt; I don't think there is a way to ban police officers from* supporting GD, it's a legal political party and corruption must be dealt with locally, right?

Of course, I never mentioned that, neither does the petition goal is something like that as far as I understand. And yes corruption and abuse of power should be dealt with locally. But when there are also human right violations the European Court can be involved and the international community can pressure Greek authorities to take action and stop turning a blind eye. The goal is not GD to seize to exist but not be allowed to take the law in its hands and commit crimes - now they do both things.

I don't know if you are Greek or not (I ask that judging from your username) but if you are or know a bit about Greek modern history you would know that the country had a troubled history with a fierce civil war and many dictatorships - the last one ended just a few decades ago - and the extreme right wing part of Greek society (which now has been concentrated in GD) is capable of hideous things.

So in the US where I'm from, we obviously have a similar situation. New York and California also pay much more than they receive. I don't think the difference is as exaggerated like in Spain but it is still substantial. Also one could consider the case of New York City. NYC by far generates the most revenue of the state, yet a large part of the political power is in the state capitol in Albany. 

So as an outsider who has lived in Spain for a while and also spoken to many people I'm a bit perplexed. What is the main basis for the separatist movement? Is it cultural? Is it purely financial? Spain is a very diverse country, but what happens if Catalunya becomes independent? What happens with Valencia and Baleares? What about Pais Vasco? Galicia? 

While I realize that Catalunya is very different from a cultural perspective, I feel like Catalans have more in common with the rest of Spain than they do with France, for example. 

Finally, if Franco hadn't imposed such strict cultural controls over Catalunya and other countries, do you think things would be the same? Are the differences due to cultural identity, lack of political power, or money?

true,[deleted],null,null,"It's possible that the PP would offer federalism in a last attempt to save Spain, but I think at least a referendum is unstoppable. Their only hope is that somehow the referendum doesn't come out in favour of independence, but I find that extremely unlikely.

Most Catalans feel there's a disconnect between them and the rest of Spain. Politically, culturally, socially, etc. For example, only 20% of Catalans voted for the PP, the currently ruling party. And that's a great result for the PP in Catalonia, usually it's closer to 15%. It's easy to feel out of place if you're consistently being governed by people you rejected.

Similarly, the Catalan parliament banned bullfighting in Catalonia. Just today it has been announced that bullfighting is a ''good of national interest'' so it can't be banned anywhere. 

In 2005, a Statute of Autonomy was drafted that transferred many powers from the central to the Catalan government. Almost everyone in Catalonia was in favour of it, but the PP blocked it and watered it down. In 2010 a lot of it was ruled unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court.

Financially, many Catalans also feel they're receiving worse government services. For example, most motorway tolls are in Catalonia. All high-speed train lines (AVE) radiate out of Madrid, when one for the ''Mediterranean Corridor'' (Barcelona-Valencia) is long overdue and would make much more sense.

The Valencian Community and the Balearic Islands feel about Catalonia the same way Catalonia feels about Madrid. They think they have a separate culture from Catalonia -many people in Valencia say they don't speak Catalan, they speak a different language called Valencian. Linguists unanimously reject this- and forming any kind of union with Catalonia would subjugate their culture. Both the Valencian Community and the Baleares are PP strongholds so they won't join Catalonia in a hypothetical separation.

The case of the Basque country is an interesting one. They have a fiscal pact similar to the one Mas wanted for Catalonia. They are the region of Spain that is performing better by far. If Catalonia separates, they would see this as their chance to do the same. My guess is that it will happen as well but with less popular support than in Catalonia.

I can't see Galicia separating. Nationalist sentiment might flare up in the coming years, but leaving Spain would be financial suicide, so it'll come back down when the economy picks up. I heard that some Galician nationalists want to join Portugal, but I'm not sure how popular this idea is. To be honest I'm not very familiar with Galician nationalism.

I think it's possible Catalonia would've become independent in the 1940s or 50s. Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC), today's main separatist party, was the biggest party during the 30s. In fact, a Catalan Republic was declared in 1934 but the government of the Second Republic sent troops and the then President of the Catalan government was sent to prison. So maybe if Franco had been more lenient towards Catalan culture, Catalonia might be already be an independent country today.",0,1348639236,null,0,false,0,c6dlc58,t3_10gnwd,t1_c6dlc58,t1_c6diyci,null,1429994108,24,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,24

As for Lesematerial, zeit.de is probably one of the better publications out there. I'll throw out an author I'd recommend. Look up Wolfgang Borchert. He wrote from 1945-1949 and his writing style is very simple and straight forward but the content is very rich. His writings center around his experiences as a political prisoner under National Socialism and then his time as a soldier and his return to a broken and destroyed Germany. If you might find that interesting, his longest and best known work is the play ""Draußen vor der Tür"" and is usually published with various poems and short stories of his.

A big chunk of learning a language is maximizing your exposure to the language. Blending it into activities or things you would have done anyway makes it seem less like ""work"".

Also, in OSX, iOS, Linux and some Android phones, you can easily switch your menu language to German. You should already know how to use your phone and know where everything is. Using it in German lets you learn some of the vocab and even if you don't otherwise speak, read or hear German that day, you'll still have some exposure to the language and stimuate your mind a little bit.

But the biggest thing is that you're doing SOMETHING outside of the classroom. A lot of language learners don't or at a very minimal level. Those are also the people you run into and they tell you about how they ""took German in college, but can't remember anything"".

Since you seem to be at a more advanced level, the best thing you can do is do a lot of reading in German. It will help you with your grammar definitely, and just seeing the ""right"" way to write things over and over again will help you once you go to write something of your own.",0,1348647855,null,0,1348648289,0,c6dmeqv,t3_10ghtv,t1_c6dmeqv,t3_10ghtv,null,1429994612,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

On monday after this formal dance some students choose to go for one day to school in their formal attires, as it was an old tradition.

After last exams of matura are finished, there is mostly a second organized dance, named ""valeta"" which is not formal but more like large party.

I don't feel comfortable with the inherent mix-up of ""illegal things on the Internet"" and ""things we don't really like but that are not illegal on the Internet"" that probably follows from having virtual police officers, whatever that term is intended to mean anyway.

What *is* obviously acceptable, both legal and in public perception, is authorities reacting to crimes on the Internet. In principle, there's no difference between a police officer arresting someone after being alerted to a theft, and, say, a prosecutor getting involved after having been made aware of a thread on a neo-Nazi forum where hate crimes are planned. The problem obviously is the the lack of borders/strong national ties of the Internet, and the question which laws apply to which incidents.

Now what is different, I believe, is that society at large accepts police officers ""preventing"" crimes in real life (or being able to react faster) by patrolling public spaces where they believe the crime rate is rather high. On the other hand, most of us (including me) don't feel comfortable extending this method to the Internet, i.e. we don't want ""cyber policemen"", as they almost certainly would be called our clueless ~~Führers~~ leaders, watching over Facebook/Reddit/etc, pre-emptively.

About the last point though: don't fool yourself please. I'm almost certain, if you would poll the broad population of *any* EU country on whether ""Internet policemen"", performing similar duties to patrolling policemen on the street, are a good idea, I'm almost sure they would gather rather strong support.

true,Ozires,FINL,Finland,"That 10th grade thing is true, though I think as much due to the gpa requirements for high school than just 'majoring' in different fields. It tends to separate the students who like to study from the ones that like to make a racket. Still I'd say schools in Scandinavia (well at least in Finland) are just not by far as bad of an experience than what's shown in American movies.

I went to a pretty much average junior high mainly because it was 'the' school in the area where you continued the swedish speaking program from elemetary school. So I think the kids were pretty regular, there was some teasing an a couple of fights, but still nothing you can see in American films. We did have some sort of a party with music and dancing on 9th grade and the graduating kids voted titles like most popular, prettiest girl, best athlete etc. But it was really a gag; I got the smartest kid prize which was a candy cellphone. 

After that I went to a high school that required a real high gpa from it's applicants and tbh there was pretty much no teasing and a real nice atmosphere all around. I think the thing that most separates Scandinavian and American schools though, are the hierarchy and authority systems. I mean we addressed our teachers by their first names or by acronyms and they made all sorts of jokes in class so it'd be more interesting to wade through the complicated material. They seemed a lot more like our friends than authority figures really. And most of them were really well-liked. I'm sure there are nice teachers in the US too, but there's that weird sort of authority thing, both teachers and students address each other by their surnames. It has such of a weird authoritarian feel to it, isn't learning a joint venture?

And all that bullying and hating school you hear when you're talking to people online doesn't really resonate with me since if you count out having to wake up so early (and when you're so young even that's not that big of a problem), school actually was pretty great. I don't remember anyone even calling others names on the hallways, which certainly did happen in junior high. Oh, and hey I studied all the extended courses on history and civics (political science?), but I never noticed any difference between others there and the natural science guys. Though almost all of us took extended maths anyways so we could share that pain. Though, everyone remembers the future med-students whining about physics courses and having to actually understand it for the entrance exams. :D

Now I figure that in some schools where there's more 'problem students' the atmosphere might not be as rosy, but when I think of it I haven't heard any horror stories from my friends who went to other high schools either. Like the FuckGoreWhore said, all the stories people tell are relegated to the junior high level. This always makes me wonder, why do american teenagers act like that, but Finnish ones don't? Either the movies are pretty much fictional or then something's up, because theres descriptions left and right of people being just awful to their fellow students. You'd think if it was purely an age thing (like is often claimed), it'd happen universally. And I find it pretty strange to think that we especially have a 'culture that discourages being an asshole to others as a kid'. Maybe someone has a better answer to this? Or maybe someone's attended a really shitty high school in Finland and can tell me it's really awful there, just like in America.",0,1348653342,null,0,false,0,c6dmujd,t3_10hqs6,t1_c6dmujd,t1_c6dmgef,null,1429994830,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2
true,Agramenauer,null,null,"I believe you are really getting too many onesided answers in this post, although from very educated individuals. There are a few key points missing.

First of all the 8% number is not accurate. It has been noted that it skips some corrections and the real deficit is around 6% (so you could relate, just like the romney taxes figure, it might be true that he actually payed more than 9%, but if you look into it he is paying less).

Second, Catalonia is a important part of the Spanish economy, but please keep in mind that other states such as Aragon or Madrid have higher PIB and also have a tax deficit. Spanish constitution  was built around the idea that solidarity between regions is vital for progress, and that those who could afford to help those in need should lend a hand. Similar to how people with higher income pay higher taxes.

Third,nobody seems to point out how the current state of catalunya debt is truly affecting them. There have been cases of people Dying in hospital due to an increasing number of operating rooms being closed. I read an article about a man who was transfered and die without the need intervention between 3 hospitals because none could still provide the medical care he needed. Sure it is the exception, but, in a country where universal healthcare is consider a basic right, a goberment needs to be against the ropes to cut the medical expenses so badly.

It is also believed outside catalunya that the political class there is funneling all the unrest into seccesion to prevent people from wondering if having a NY embassy or nothing less than 6 state channels on TV is really worth it when basic healthcare is at risk (i am a doctor so thats  why I am into this kind of stuff, my knowledge in other areas is average at best).

Homecoming?  School prom?  School football/basketball team, with supporting cheerleaders?  This kind of thing seems very alien to me, and I don't mean just the specifics, I mean the whole idea of ritualized social events with apparently very rigid rules that seem to be all about enforcing the pecking order of who is ""popular"" and who is not.  I'm also amazed by the crazy rules that schools are apparently able to enact and how easily they can expel students (e.g., it would seem in many states in the US it's legally OK to expel a student because they're gay), and yet there seems to be an awful amount of bullying which they cannot or will not end.  But even more surprising to me is the complicated code of unwritten rules that high school students seem to conform to in the process of ""dating"": apparently you don't just go out with someone, you have to go through a lot of predefined hoops which mirror an incredibly rigid social structure.  Not to mention incredibly rigid gender roles.

The whole picture is surreal.  And I wonder how accurate it is.

I'm not saying there are no social interactions between high school students or no bullying, but mostly they just ignore each other except for friends, there are no activities involving the whole school, no particular rules on courtship rituals, and sport teams are pretty much disconnected from schools.  High school is about following courses, probably hanging out with friends, not all that...  other stuff.

But then I wonder whether the picture I have of American schools isn't, in fact, completely distorted.  Perhaps it's just a cliché and there's no such thing as the popular high school &lt;some sport&gt; team captain who gets to date all the girls.

As a German, I'm supportive of that principle and Germany follows it on the level of the EU and on the national level (rich states support poor states).  Now, I'm wondering if the Catalan people who want independence from Spain reject that principle in general or only in their specific case.  Put bluntly, the contradiction in my eyes seems to be that, one the one hand, they don't want to support the poorer parts of Spain but seem to be ok with the idea of receiving support from the EU.

true,Vespasianus,NETH,The Netherlands,"Im 1/4 American and was curious about what American schools were like. I decided to do a long exchange to the states and lived with my mum. Here are some key differences I noted between my Dutch and American schools. Note, not every school is like this, obviously.

* As an American high school student, no one trusts you. No one sees you as anything resembling an adult. You needed a pass just to walk around the corridors. Your parents needed to come and pick you up if you were ill or needed to leave.

* There is usually a fully trained nurse at the school. She takes your temperature regardless of what you are complaining of. I was sent back to class with a headache because I had no fever. I had asked for a paracetamol, and was refused (""you need a note from a doctor for that!"")

* I had the same schedule every day, 8h to 16h with only one half hour break.

* All students are lumped together in one school regardless of ability or eventual plans after graduation.

* There was no geography and very little history aside from American history.

* Schools funnel massive amounts of money into bizarre 'school pride' rallies and those in-school sport clubs we always see on tv.

* Sex and drug education is appalling. There was NO sex education, and the 6 months of drug education can only be described by repeating ""DRUG X WILL KILL YOU"" ad infinitum.

* There was a free bus that picked you up and dropped you off from home/school.

* The cafeteria was like a mini restaurant within the school. There were very few healthy items to be had. Very few students brought lunch from home. Also, Americans will eat 3 hot meals a day every day which I found utterly bizarre.

If you're curious, I can provide more examples. Also, it should be noted that this school was voted one of the best in the state and was situated in a rather wealthy suburb of a relatively large city. It wasn't some backwards farm village.

Finally after second year of high school she ended up in my class, where it seems she felt good because she stayed there till the end (3 more years). We basically ignored her completely and avoided her as much as possible (man, the odour around her was heavier than manure) and I think she liked it that way. At least nobody was calling her a dragon or a monstrosity on a daily basis.

true,aldhelm,null,null,"This is a coalition government between the Anti-EU Conservative Party and the Pro-EU Liberal Democrats. The leaders have decided to take a middling course to the EU during the present term of the government. They won’t get closer to the EU or take any action that takes them further away from the EU. The future of the UK depends on the next party to take power. 

The Labour party which is the most likely to win power in the next election is slightly Pro-EU but they are more pragmatic, for example they never joined the EU even when it made economic sense. They know the people hated it to much and couldn’t stand to lose the Pound. The Liberal Democrats are very pro EU but they look set to be demolished in the next election by their voters who feel betrayed. If Scotland does choose to become independent the chances of Labour winning is slimmer and the Lib Dems have another nail in their coffin.
The Conservatives are the ones to watch. The party is split between pragmatics and reactionaries, Fiscal conservatives and social conservatives. The Business side of the party will want to be in the EU. They are usually the ones in charge but when the reactionary crowds get noisy they buckle and are pushed into taking Anti-EU stances. The conservatives have a habit of picking weak leaders who think they can repeat a Thatcher. It happened to John Major in the ‘90s when MPs in the party pushed him to being belligerent and ended up looking like a fool. David Cameron is a man of the same cloth. Just look at the fiscal treaty vote. He got pushed by his party members to veto it and it gained him nothing. He relented in the end to allow the Eurozone countries to use the EU facilities. What’s even worse for the Conservatives is the fact that the UKIP is gaining anti-EU people who normally vote Tories. Thanks to his party screwing up the Lords reform, he’s made it easier for Labour to win the next election and he needs every single point.

All in all the likelihood of the UK leaving the EU is slim until 2015. After that there is a good chance that the UK will either swing Labour, Labour/Lib Coalition or Conservatives. Only the last one has a chance at taking us out of the EU and it looks slim.  I’ve put my pound that Labour will win and we stay in the EU.

I don't understand the term ""popularity"" in this context. Stars are popular. Teens are attractive or not attractive, being able to easily find relationships or not. This was all that mattered. I bitterly envied the guys who were attractive and could easily find a GF but nobody cared how much other guys like them which I think this ""popularity"" thing means. 

Seriously, I find it hard to understand this concept of popularity unless you are a pop star. Are ""popular"" people the ones who have many friends? But you don't have the time for many friends, so nobody had a circle larger than 4-5 people. Nobody was in this sense popular, the major difference was the attractiveness between people i.e. the ease of finding a GF.

While we are at it, I am not sure about the  term ""bullying"" either. Our strong guys just plain simply beaten up the weak ones. It was beating, not ""bullying"". But only in elementary school in high school this was considered immature. As for picking on like calling people names everybody did that to everybody so there were no special bullies. I got to name the fat guy Bacon even though I was a weak nerd and he wasn't offended, just chased me laughing. In this sense high school was OK, but the beatings in elementary school those were brutal. The strong guys beaten everybody until they cried. Every day. They just liked hearing that crying. I think they must have had some problem in the brain, they could hardly even learn basic algebra or writing.

I find the idea of the prom ridiculous, because they make average kids dress up like very rich upper classy people, like aristocrats on some grand ball. WTF?

I went to school in the 90'es (finished high school in 2000), so I had a lot of extraordinary situations like no school for 3 months because of war, teacher strikes every year which again means no school for a week, student protests, power outages etc. Some of the teachers were all right, some were crazy, and I remember with one of them we even went out for beer a few times (he was 20-something).

In elementary and high school we had a ""class"" which never changed for 8+4 years (except when people left). Each class had its own classroom (a room with the sign 7c would mean 7th year of class c) and the teachers would come to us, not like in American schools where you go to the teacher's classroom. The exception were the physics, chemistry, biology and sports classes, obviously because of the equipment. The good thing about having your own classroom is that you always had a safe place to hide, for example we had cases where ""the whole school"" wanted to beat up some guy from our class and we literally all held the door so they wouldn't come in. Since we always sit in the same room everyone has ""his place""; I remember some teachers didn't allow us to change places (probably cause they couldn't remember us otherwise) and demanded that we get back to our place. 

Now a friend of mine went to one of those 3-year schools, that was fucking ghetto. Kids would throw a knife at the blackboard while the teacher was writing on it etc. I never actually went there, once a guy from our class visited a friend of his there and he was severely beaten up.

- The reform of the electoral law with the design of a new electoral process, so that truly represents the will of the people before any election that is necessary to facilitate the development of a democratic constituent process.

- The immediate repeal of all the cuts and reforms against the welfare state taken with the excuse of the crisis, and involving restrictions of rights and freedoms of citizens, it is a disaster not only for the country but taxes have been betraying the people's will.

- A deep fiscal reform, to make people pay more to get more benefit of society. We also demand the repeal of the tax amnesty decreed by the government, whose injustice is a real mockery of honest taxpayers.

- The abolition of all privileges of those who hold political office or public, and the implementation of effective control mechanisms in the performance of their duties.

- The immediate cessation of all evictions, and the provision of the population to social rental price of homes owned by banks and who have been helped by public funds.

- The creation of new jobs, the first premise is sustainability, and whose purpose is the development of humanity and consistent management of available jobs so that all citizens can work to live but is not obliged to live to work. It is a huge deception that has to work increasingly fallacy supported by the greed of the big interests and against the interests of ordinary people.

Now, here we go:

Your argument is assuming the following points: 

1) We would have to ask for it's acception as if it was a new country.
2) Staying out of the EU means paying export taxes.
3) Spain would boycott our products and our economy would break for it.
4) Tourism would decrease.

I'm going to answer them one by one:

1) There's no regulation on the EU about countries secession's. Plain and simple. If Catalonia's independence came true, the EU would have to make a new regulation for it. Now I'm not saying they would accept us, I'm just saying it's unknown what would happen and that anyone telling you the opposite is just lying. Yeah, Italy or Spain would try to keep us out, but also Germany and the other rich regions wouldn't be interested in keeping out another rich region, so we can't know what would happen.

2) Staying out of the EU doesn't mean you pay taxes. See Norway, for instance.

3) Boycott would have a mild effect in the economy in the short term, yes. In the long term it could even be good for it, as was the boycott to the ""cava"" some years ago. ""cava"" producers looked for an international market for it, they found it and when the boycott was over, not only they had almost no loses from it but after it they were selling both to Spain and internationally, and are now selling more than they were. You can't pretend Spain is the center of the world and the only place to sell things...

Sometimes there are shows during the breaks by student dancers, gymnasts or student bands.

Or consider another thing found in movies: the idea that a guy might (should?) ""propose"" to his girlfriend, ask her in marriage by showing her a diamond ring, preferably at an unexpected moment, perhaps even dropping to his knees.  This seems so corny it could only be a cliché about the US, a sort of recurring meme that nobody would abide in real life except as a joke.  Well, judging from the number of Reddit posts on the subject (e.g., in r/happy), I understand there's at least some element of truth in that cliché.

So yes, I realize that the picture I drew of the American high school is a cliché and generally untrue (and I *hope* I made that clear, because it was more or less my whole point), but that doesn't really tell me which parts are completely false, which parts are true but misrepresented, which are non-uniform across the country or across social classes, and which parts are reasonably correct.  I can hardly believe the whole ""school prom"" concept is completely fabricated, for example (as with proposals-cum-diamond-ring, there must be at least *some* truth to it).  But then, which parts are wrong: that *most* American high schools hold a prom at the end of senior year?  that most students attend?  that there's a sort of official ""who-dates-whom"" list?  that students feel pressured to find themselves a date for that event?  And I could ask similar questions about the importance of school sport teams, courtship rituals, peer pressure and bullying, etc.

I am not an Economist nor an Expert,  but I asked myself the same. 
After some research I got to the point where I found out how we create money. With debt... banks create our money out of nowhere  and than loan it to us.  But they don't loan it to us for free, we have to pay an Interest rate.
So the banks put 100€ into the economy and they want 110€ back, but how do we create those 10 €? 
With growth! We have to make a profit so we can afford to pay it back. So we need growth or our System doesn't work. 

The system itself seems wrong and it looks like we have reached a point where the ""burden"" of the interest rate gets to high and we will need a reset (read Crash) sooner or later. I also think a reset will mean that the world economy will collapse.
I don't think anybody wants that, so it seems that we will have to ""kick the can further down the road"" as long as we can.

C'est une mutilation techniquement, mais la mettre sur le même plan que l'excision est fallacieux. 

Pour moi appliquer l'interdiction de la circoncision c'est implicitement déclarer aux juifs pratiquants qu'il peuvent aller se faire voir en Israel ou aux musulmans qu'il peuvent retourner dans leur pays d'origine. Je pense aussi que le risque des circoncisions clandestines ne vaut pas la peine sur un plan sanitaire... tout ça parce que les laïques ont envie de montrer qu'ils sont en position de force et peuvent rabattre le caquet des religieux de tout poil.

The bottom line is, if a terrorist wants to terrorize you he *can*, even if you have tossed out your democracy for a authoritarian and totalitarian regime.

* Drop support for autocracies in the Middle East.

&gt;They give no basis whatsoever. Who fought for what piece of land, or who built the most where are not arguments for claiming rights. Demographics are.

They give every basis I can think of. The history of your people is what defines where you came from, and act as a reference to define where are you heading. The tales and stories what you tell to your children, the songs, the dances, the clothing, so everything what defines your culture feeds itself from the past, from history. 
Think about a young country like the USA, where there are some native population indeed, but most of the people are descendants of immigrants from Africa, Asia, from Europe or from somewhere else. They are from many different races with many different religions but they are all “Americans”. They learn the same historical events of the USA, and they all gather under the same flag whatever they do, or achieve.

.

&gt;And they were also forced to convert to some Western Christian denomination to be able to have a say in politics. But that meant assimilation of the converted one, so they still had no say. There's a reason the national movement in 19th c. Transylvania developed around the Greek-Catholic Romanians, not the Orthodox ones.

But Transylvania never was Greek Catholic. I agree that medieval times in Europe were horrible by today's standards, and  I also honestly admit that I still don’t really understand the *”reasons”* and events around the Romanian and also around the Transylvanian religions. The Hasburgs and the Reformation made a huge impact on the region, and it’s all a big political mess to me.

There was an interesting pool in 1699 when the Romanian church united, and they asked the people about what basis they had when they made their choice and it turned out that they didn’t have much idea about Christianity at all (let alone the east-west schism) and they made their choice based on local politics. If I would have to guess, I think that the national movements later used it as another evidence of the Latin origins, but still don’t really see how this all comes to Transylvania which was mostly western catholic since the beginning, just like the rest of the Hungarian kingdom or the Austro-Hungarian Empire.


.
&gt;So how does one differentiate latin-speakers from avar-speakers in archeological digs.

No-how obviously, but the science of history doesn’t work that way. When there is no possible way to gather direct evidences, you simply rule out all the available false options, and cross-reference different results of different scientific fields, until you arrive to the only possible and right conclusion. Before that, you only have theories which are all waiting to be proven.

.

&gt;Also, how far do Celtic traces extend? Afaik they weren't relevant to the area by the time the Romans left Dacia. 

That’s exactly the point. We have dig sites of graves and ruins from different ethnics from different times. History can track the Agathyrsi, the Avars, the Clets and the Thracians, etc, but there is no evidence of anything Romance related from those times. You don’t “Latinize” an entire(!) ethnic group in less than two hundred years, that’s simply not possible. We now know that the whole region was already partly Christian way before the Hungarian Kingdom, and there are also (questionable) studies and theories that even some of the arriving Hungarian scythe-ish tribes were already Christians due to the mixing with the Alans and some other groups along their journey. It’s true that there are a few sites of some “Latin settlements north of the Danube after the evacuation of 271”, but we don’t know who really lived there and the linking of those to Romanian groups arriving in the 12th century is still inconclusive. It looks like that it was really a no-mans-land with negligible tribal or vandal activity for a long time, and whoever lived in those few settlements were “gone” for the later times, just like there are no Agathyrsi or Avars today.

Another thing is that Hungarians called the Vlachs (the Romanians) to “Olah” (a substitute of “Olasz” = Italian), which has a meaning of “the people who speak in new-Latin language”, and this Olah was consistently used form the 11th century to describe Romanians. (sadly this calling accumulated some very bad taste in the 20th century, but it had a very different (non-offensive) meaning in the historical times.

I must say it again to make it absolutely clear that I’m not against the Daco-Roman continuity, and I have nothings against the Romanian people at all. All I’m saying is that I’m only interested in the truth and – afaik -  the theory was never proven scientifically, (and – btw - even the wiki you linked is still an argument).


.
&gt;I don't know what you mean by the genetic ones

It was a question. For example, the Szekelys found to have significant amount of Asian genetic traits ([P-M45(xM173)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_Q_%28Y-DNA%29) which is very common in Asia, but you can’t find it in any other central-European ethnic groups. I was wondering if there is any recent genetic study out there to back up the Daco-Roman theory. I  -of course - didn’t imply that today Romanians and Hungarians are genetically distinguishable in any way, so don’t get me wrong please.

.

&gt;Also, am I correct in assuming you are Hungarian?

Yes sir, so please excuse my English:-)

Flemish in Belgium, Brittany on France, Greenland in Denmark, Aland in Finland, Babaria in Germany, Upper silesia in Poland... and many more. Some of them aren't as active as the independence movement in catalonia, but some of their claims are as righful as yours. Also I think you are overstating the economical power of Catalnya as an independent nation. Keep in mind that countries like germany have a strong position to even throw the PIGS out of the EU. Believing that a new formed country that is carrying 1/3 of the total regional debt of all Spain is going to have it easier than the hold country united is ridiculous. Over your second point I will point you at this article

http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2012/09/11/espana/1347365501.html

For those not fluent in spanish, it explains that the European Comission has already clearly stated that they would need to renegotiate there entrance to the UE and they would need the unanymous vote from all the members. The only advantage they have is that they already comply to most of the normative, so they could get in the queue faster, but they would still need to be accepted, and as explained above some nations wouldnt comply (only 1 vote against is needed).

2)I'd love if you could elaborate more your arguments, like explaining that they are part of the EFTA, not the EEA, explaining how would you enter the EEA which may also block new memberships by its members (see UK failed attempts due to france block until the 70s, when only the new goberment decided to accept them). Also I love the irony of using a country that gives a grant to the rest of Europe to lessen the economical differences between its members. The exact thing Catalunya wants to avoid completely with the seccesion.

3) and 4) The boicott had a mild effect because it wasn't actually followed massively. As pointed above it isnt clear if you would be even able to enter the EEA, so until then you would have to enter a market with export taxes, manage a new coin in the currency market with the threat of flight of capital to other stronger currencies, all while your, cureently, stronger consumer gives you the cold shoulder... Last boicott was only followed buy those people you rightfully despise, people full of hate and resentment that hate their own brothers. If those few had an effect, imagine how the rest of the spanish population would react, when they see catalunya as the guy who tries to jump offboard instead of trying to help the rest of the crew bailing out. Would you think that, after claiming that you dont want to help poorer states, those poor states would still come to you for the comodities they could get from cheaper from other countries?

I dont know if you have a similar situation in US, with some people claiming that they pay too much and that people poorer than them should find their own way. I believe it is a man you call Romney.

No it doesn't. And I'm not really sure what you're trying to say with the following paragraph. It's poetic and all, but it really doesn't mean much for the current discussion.

&gt;But Transylvania never was a Greek Catholic. 

Half the Romanian population of Transylvania was Greek-Catholic (Uniate) after 1700. See:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_Church_United_with_Rome,_Greek-Catholic

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transylvanian_School

&gt;When there is no possible way to gather direct evidences, you simply rule out all the available false options

How can you rule something out when you don't have evidence. Remember, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.

&gt;There was an interesting pool in 1699 when the Romanian church united, and they asked the people about what basis they had when they made their choice and it turned out that they didn’t have much idea about Christianity at all (let alone the east-west schism)

I'd like to see that pole. Link? (Doesn't matter if it's a Hungarian link)

&gt;Transylvania which was mostly western catholic since the beginning, just like the rest of the Hungarian kingdom or the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

It might have had a Roman Catholic majority up untill the Protestant reformation, but I doubt it. I'm not sure how reliable medieval censuses are.

&gt;We have dig sites of graves and ruins from different ethnics from different times. History can track the Agathyrsi, the Avars, the Clets and the Thracians, etc, but there is no evidence of anything Romance related from those times. 

You have no way of knowing  the language of those interred in those graves. Think about it this way: when the Magyars changed their culture from nomadic pagans to sedentary christians, they did not loose their language.

&gt; It’s true that there are a few sites of some “Latin settlements north of the Danube after the evacuation of 271”, but we don’t know who really lived there and the linking of those to Romanian groups arriving in the 12th century is still inconclusive. 

So we do have evidence.

&gt;It looks like that it was really a no-mans-land with negligible tribal or vandal activity for a long time, and whoever lived in those few settlements were “gone” for the later times

It doesn't look that way. But a terra nullius narrative always favors the latest conquerors.

&gt;You don’t “Latinize” an entire(!) ethnic group in less than two hundred years, that’s simply not possible. 

Nobody claims that all the Dacians were Latinized in 200 years. The claim is that it was sufficiently latinised (including through imigration) in order for that the Latin linguistic element to become dominant, and in the subsequent period to assimilate the rest.

&gt;(and – btw - even the wiki you linked is still an argument).

Yes, an argument where there is various evidence presented in favour of continuity and against the imigration theory, including archeological evidence. Evidence which you did not address.

&gt;I was wondering if there is any recent genetic study out there to back up the Daco-Roman theory.

Genetics don't help one way or another. Romanians are similar to other populations from around the area.

See: http://bigthink.com/strange-maps/306-the-genetic-map-of-europe and http://www.tdaxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/genmapeuropea2-479x281.jpg and http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Haplogroups_europe.png

&gt; For example, the Szekelys found to have significant amount of Asian genetic traits (P-M45(xM173)) which you can’t find in any other European ethnic group.

This is very interesting. Although I don't think you gave the right link. This is what I found: http://www2.sci.u-szeged.hu/fokozatok/PDF/Kovacsne_Csanyi_Bernadett/tezisfuzet_angol_CsanyiB.pdf (although some parts of the methodology may be targets for criticism, like selecting all the Szekely samples from one village)

""[...] Né si può ignorare che nell’antico e popolare adagio “Ciribiribin fa candelieri…”, l’ignoto bardo recita testualmente : “Ciribiribin fa candelieri / potte sudicie senza peli / e la donna se la gratta / cazzi di legno e potte di latta….”; questi versi che ci richiamano alla mente il Poliziano e la tradizione dei trovatori, ripropongono la potta anche come tema centrale di una certa letteratura cortese che trova il suo culmine proprio nel celebre distico “…la mi’ moglie era un po’ ghiotta / ciabattate sulla potta”

(il gioco dello scambiarsi “ciabattate sulla potta” era stato creato dal Ficino come svago delle gentildonne dal casato Rucelai negli orti Oricellarii; le fanciulle si disponevano sedute sul prato in cerchio a gambe divaricate, tirando su le vesti in modo da lasciare scoperte le pudenda e tenendo in una mano una ciabattina di broccatello; una di loro stava in piedi al centro e recitava un verso con la rima in –otta, del tipo “Ser Lorenzo ha la gotta…” oppure “Ho mangiato la ricotta…” e le altre, a questo dire, si scambiavano una volta a destra, una volta a sinistra, un colpo di ciabatta sul pube in bella vista, declamando in coro : “Ciabattate sulla potta…!”; il gioco aveva termine quando la prima fanciulla aveva esaurito le rime e allora, per penitenza, si doveva fa possedere del Ficino, mentre le compagne intorno cantavano : “in quest’aura galeotta / mentr’intorno il ciel annotta / il Ficino lo scappotta / e te l’zeba nella potta!”).""

The argument is that if Catalonia didn't have such a large percentage of its taxes (6-10% depending on who you ask, in Germany it's 4%) sent to other parts of Spain it wouldn't have to receive support from the EU (or at least not to the same extent it has to now). The same goes for the bailout from the Spanish central government. If Catalonia had a fairer tax deal like the one the Basque Country/Navarra have or indeed no tax deal (i.e. independence), they could use some of that tax money to pay off their debts which means investors would regain confidence in them and so Catalonia wouldn't have to borrow at the current prohibitive rates it does know.

The counter-argument is that an independent Catalonia would have many unknowns and would therefore be a big risk for investors, so borrowing rates would skyrocket.

The counter-counter-argument is that staying in Spain is already a lost cause so they might as well take the risk and get out of this seemingly endless spiral of austerity measures and negative growth rates.",0,1348672294,null,0,false,0,c6dpkey,t3_10gnwd,t1_c6dpkey,t1_c6dmx20,null,1429996161,17,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,17

Do you understand that that is one of the ways to calculate the fiscal balance? Do you understand that it is that negative because it takes into account the current deficit in Spain? Dou you remember that the other way to calculate it, which yields a 0'4%, was the one used so far in the last 10 years, and why they sudenly changed that? Do you know that using the same method to calculate fiscal balance in other states yields an even higher deficit (including places you mention, like Euskadi)? Also point out that this article comes from a catalonian newpaper about the protest of a catalonian divison of  the opposition party. Just in case you want again to try to disregard prove based on who says it.

For our US friends, its the same issue you had with republicans claiming the unemployment rate had doubled by changing the way you count it, whereas if you used the same way to calculate the change was 10 times lower.

&gt; Then about this whole EU thing, again, I don't care what some guy said after Madrid's pressures. I'm 99% sure if the situation happened they would make new rules, that was the whole point of my argument.

Its not some guy. It was an official statement from the European Comission. I pointed that i didnt think they could get in the EU, and backed it with proof. You are just guessing and assuring they would make new rules and everything would be fine omiting the fact that the european comision has already stated you are wrong in that point. Are you also willing to omit that before all this happened, the 5th of June, the CE also denied the petition to create an outside treatie to gurantee what you are assuring? That seccesion would make catalonians lose their EU citizenship?

&gt; I'm about to think you're next going to tell me that we can't become independent because the Spanish constitution forbids it lol

Please in future opportunities avoid using Strawman. I didn't say it at any point, if you cant argument against my point at least dont try to discredit it adding stuff I wouldn't even consider

&gt;TL;DR: Europe is not interested in allowing secessions inside right now, so they make it look all dark. However, if the situation happens, they will have no option but to allow us.

A difference on whether a country should exist or not is a pretty big difference in my book.

&gt;Catalonia banned bullfighting but made Correbous and other stuff a ""good of national interest"" too so it's exactly the same thing, just one nationalism over another.

Maybe. But the fact remains that Catalans democratically voted for something and the central government told them they couldn't do it. It undermines the whole concept that the Catalan nation is in Spain by consent.

How is this important? Every country in the world had never been its own country at some point. The fact of the matter is Catalonia is a nation and as recognised by the UN Bill of Human Rights -which Spain signed and ratified- they have a right to self-determination. Whether they should become independent is another debate, but whether they have the right to is undeniable.

&gt;has NEVER been at war with Spain

There has been plenty of opposition to Spanish centralism, especially during the late 17th and early 18th century. Catalonia allied with France against Spain during the revolts of the 16th century (a Catalan Republic was even proclaimed but was short-lived as Spain managed to invade all of Catalonia except the Roussillon). This was hundreds of years ago so we don't know how widespread support was; not that it matters today.

&gt;the Corona de Aragon, of which Catalonia was a part of joined Spain willingly

This is a half-truth. While it is true that the Crown of Aragon and the Crown of Castille joined willingly, their constituent parts were still independent and acted more as a confederation than a single country. It was only until the War of Spanish Succesion that a real attempt by Philip V to unify Spain occured. Catalonia allied with the other side, with Austrian Archduke Charles VI, to try to maintain some of its autonomy it had enjoyed under the Crown of Aragon. When Philip V won he signed the Nueva Planta decrees as punishment for the regions that had fought against him.

Basically, each party elected into a parliament is a fraction, but there is one exception, which is the reason why we need this term in the first place: CDU (Christian Democratic Union) and their Bavarian pendant CSU (Christian Social Union) are both in the Bundestag, the most important German parliament, and are united in the ""Union"", forming a fraction. All the other parties in a local, regional or national parliament are fractions themselves, even if they are currently in a coalition with one or more other parties. The term is used both for the party/parties currently in charge and those which are part of the opposition.

So in this case, ""Piratenfraktion"" refers to the members of the German Pirate Party (a young, yet quite successful party, part of a European initiative originating in Sweden; their main topics are freedom of information and civic rights) who have been elected to the Landtag (=term used for the highest parliament of each Bundesland) of Schleswig-Holstein, a Bundesland (=state) in northern Germany, bordering on Denmark.

There's two sides to this, and they can both be negative and positive. A pan-continental army can easier be misused by crony plutocrats which can condense their influence into lobbyists that only has to work through revolving doors in one place (Read: Washington, Brussels, Berlin etc.). On the other hand, a sovereign national army can also be misused in the same way, much like the British army in Iraq. So they can both be misused. 

However, say a pan-continental military threat, like a hypothetical Russian/Chinese invasion (Not likely to happen at all but still), you'd rather want a pan-continental counter army than lots of independent small armies.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;The bullfighting issue is to me a stupid one because until Catalonia bans everything related with bullfighting, including Catalan traditions, I will only see it as a stupid nationalist thing. It hasn't anything to do with animal rights and everything to do with being against anything Spanish, which to me sounds wrong.

Yes I agree with you, it is a stupid nationalistic thing. But when a nation democratically votes in favour of something, it's undemocratic for another power to nullify that decision.

&gt;To me, complaining about having to pay more is stupid because I believe that the richer should be taxed more than the poor and that should happen on a national level too. So if Catalonia, Madrid, Valencia and Balears have to pay more to help Extremadura and Andalucia so be it and I'll be happy to do it. In an hipotetical Catalan independence would you agree if some taxes collected in the Barcelona province were used to help Lleida or Girona? It's absolutely the same and I can't see this argument stand.

The argument isn't that Catalonia pays more taxes. Taxes (except for Basque Country and Navarra) are paid by people, so a person earning 50,000€ in Barcelona will pay the same taxes as a person earning 50,000€ in Extremadura. Everyone accepts that.

The argument is that Catalonia receives worse level of services with that funding. Most toll roads are in Catalonia. The AVE radiates out of Madrid when Barcelona-Valencia was much more important. I slightly disagree with this argument. While I think places like Valencia and Malaga clearly overspent I don't think Barcelona has it much worse either. (EDIT: To clarify, I meant that this argument alone isn't enough to demand independence).

&gt;What if, for example, the Tarragona province voted no to independance and the rest voted yes so it turned 55% for Yes nationwide. What would you think we should do?

It's a good question. I think that the same way you need more than 55% to validate the referendum, you'd need less than 45% to negate the result. So if Tarragona were to vote only 43% in favour, they could stay in Spain.",0,1348683860,null,0,1348688228,0,c6dsml5,t3_10gnwd,t1_c6dsml5,t1_c6drykz,null,1429997605,5,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,5

true,Kela3000,FINL,Finland,"&gt;High school is about following courses, probably hanging out with friends, not all that... other stuff.

This is pretty much how I would sum up my high school, speaking as a Finn. To me, the bully mentality and/or cliques depicted in American movies seem so... alien. But then again, there may differences. I grew up in a small municipality, but I attended high school at a nearby city, where I didn't know that many people beforehand. Basically, I wanted a change of scenery, and with that, I kissed goodbye to the majority of people I had known since middle school or even elementary school, true friends notwithstanding. So, I don't know what the group dynamic was in the high school of my beloved home town, but in the ""big city"", (and I can't emphasize the quotation marks strongly enough) I had a very pleasant time.",0,1348684152,null,0,false,0,c6dspgr,t3_10hqs6,t1_c6dspgr,t1_c6dmwjh,null,1429997642,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

*For 1. It would rather be Wie ist dein Name? Even if most german as a foreign language books translate What with Was, but in this case it sounds more natural to ask Wie ist dein Name? bzw. Germans probably use neither of those instead I would use: Wie heißt du? Typical German Names: Marie, Anna, Laura, Sophie, Martin, Sebastian, Christopher, Konstantin, Lisa, Jennifer... etc.

*For 2. Random number... 

*For 3. Choose combinations: Meine Famile besteht aus: or use Außer meiner Eltern habe ich noch ..../ meine Großeltern mütterlicher und väterlicherseits/ meinen Onkel/ meine Tante /meine Onkel (plural) /meine Tanten (plural) Ich habe eine Schwester/einen Bruder, zwei-(any number you want) Schwestern und/oder zwei-(any number you want) Brüder / außerdem habe ich noch vier Cousinnen und Cousins (Vetter and Base as old german words are not used anymore, only Vetter might be rarelly used Base I haven't  heard in ages)

*For 4. The question must be: Hast du ein Haustier? Antwort: Ja ich habe..... einen Hund/eine Katze/zwei Hunde/drei Katzen/ein Kaninchen/einen Papagei/einen Hamster/fünf Merrschweinchen/einen Kanarienvogel etc.
or Nein, ich habe kein Haustier.

*For 5. rot,blau (the most common), grün, gelb, rosa, pink, schwarz, weiß, hellblau, dunkelgrün, orange (I know white and black are not considered actual colors)

*For 6. Ski fahren, lesen, kochen, reiten, malen, Gesellschaftsspiele spielen, backen, mit Freunden treffen, Fahrrad fahren, im Internet surfen, chatten, ins Kino gehen, Eislaufen, shoppen etc. etc. etc.

*For 7. Yeah make some numbers up. Be aware of the fact that dates are written in german different: 5.4.1967 means 5th of April not 4th of May. 

*For 8. choose colors from 5 and mix it with gestreift, karriert or what ever you want. 

*For 9. The question sound right like this. The first part. Was willst du nach der Schule tun? Makes sence. The secound needs to be fixed. Delete the ""zu"". But than your question would be what do you want to do after work? And that would be retirement in this kind of question linked to the school. Because I quess your answer should be something like ""Studying physics or something similar. Therefor answers for 9: studieren (for just persue higher education) or for a specific major Mathematik/Politikwissenschaften/Medizin/BWL/Jura/Biologie/Veterinärmedizin/Wirtschaftswissenschaften studieren (etc. etc.)

*For 10. Spaghetti/Nudelsuppe/Hähnchen mit Reis/Wiener Schnitzel mit Kartoffelbrei/Currywurst/Lasagne/gefüllte Paprika mit Reis/Tortellini in Käsesoße/Eierpfannkuchen/Steak mit Bratkartoffeln
