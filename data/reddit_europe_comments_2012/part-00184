true,LostInACave,EURO,Liberal Europhile,"Globalisation, is the main driver here as well as Climate change. If the EU wants to maintain its position in the world, it will need to strengthen its bonds. A unified Europe can ensure economic and social stability for the continent, as the single market will easily compete with the US, China, Brazil and India in the coming years. 

We are entering a multi-polar world, with great powers such as China, India and possibly Brazil on the rise towards super power status. It is vital that Europe continue to integrate further to ensure stability and safety for the continent. If not then Europe could disintegrate into states which instead of worrying about the outside world, are too invested in their neighbours. That would be a very worrying development.

Climate change also represents a great threat, if the EU ensure that Southern Europe focus on a solar power system, Northern Europe focus on wind, wave, thermal and hydro power systems then the continent could become self sufficient, and no longer rely on Russian gas. Continued funding towards Nuclear Fusion and Fission will also be highly beneficial. 

If Europe splits then it would be increasingly difficult for European states to remain relevant. Britain and France, even Germany matter little on the global stage now. China, India, Brazil, Korea, Japan and Mexico are becoming more important players, if Europe wants to remain relevant it needs to show a more unified front.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korochun

&gt;Korochun (Russian: корочун, карачун, Slovak: Kračún, Romanian: Crăciun) was a pagan Slavic holiday. It was considered the day when the Black God and other spirits associated with decay and darkness were most potent. Max Vasmer derived the word from the Common Slavonic for ""to step forward"". The first recorded usage of the term was in 1143, when the author of the Novgorod First Chronicle referred to the winter solstice as ""Korochun"".

&gt;It was celebrated by pagan Slavs on December 21 the longest night of the year and the night of the winter solstice. On this night, Hors, symbolising old sun, becomes smaller as the days become shorter in the Northern Hemisphere, and dies on December 22, the winter solstice. It is said to be defeated by the dark and evil powers of the Black God. On December 23 Hors is resurrected and becomes the new sun, Koleda.

&gt;Modern scholars tend to associate this holiday with the ancestor worship. On this day Western Slavs lit fires at cemeteries to keep their loved ones warm, and organized feasts to honour the dead and keep them fed. They also lit wooden logs at local crossroads. In some Slavic languages, the word came to denote unexpected death of a young person and the evil spirit that shortens life.

Well we hadn't really had a French-German war since WWII  and European integration deservers some credit for that. (3/4 of a century must be some sort of record even if you go back in time before there was a unified Germany.) I sort of hope we can continue to build on that. A complete lack of wars (large, small and civil ones) seems like a good idea, also even the greatest optimist has to admit that a century is a long time.

Perhaps further integration and a continual and gradual transference of sovereignty from nation states to the European Union can help avoid any wars between European states until 2112. A bit of a loss of national identity would be a small price to pay for that.

I would also hope for some better cultural integration of immigrants into our society and an overall cultural synchronization across Europe. Modern telecommunication and transportation infrastructure will help with the latter part. As for the former; I don't see the horror scenarios of being overrun and outbreed by barbarian hordes that some see, but instead hopefully extrapolate the already evident cultural assimilation that has been going on for years or decades. With a little luck there won't be enough difference between any of us to matter enough to start a fight over.

Economically I hope that we can get over the current financial trouble and raise up the poorer European countries closer to the level of the richer ones. I would hope that the Euro gets extended a bit more once the current troubles are over. There need not be a superpower status involved. 

I would hope for more power to ESA and perhaps a few more similar ventures. I am not particularly in favour of a unified military, but if t saves me taxes and is mostly use as a deterrence and for the occasional humanitarian mission I could live with that development. I would hope for some more reforms of the EU that would give it more power but also more democracy. 

Realistically I know that things won't always work out that well and that there will be all sorts of crises and stuff, but I remain hopeful.

Pessimistically I would otherwise have to admit that the whole thing might be doomed. That the EU will fall apart and that right wing demagogues will gain power all over the place as they take advantage of people's dissatisfaction. That there will be dictatorships in what is now a Europe mostly made up of free democracies and perhaps wars civil and uncivil ones. I would also have to give thought to foreign powers overshadowing us and foreign conflicts influencing us. I would have to entertain scenarios of outside threats coming after Europe whether it is united or not.

Of course all that will be a mute point since by all estimates in 2047 (around November or December) human civilization will be destroyed in a grey goo scenario nano-technology catastrophe.

&gt;Yes, it's similar to the Slav Kracun, but other theories are just as compelling.

No they are not. They are deeply biased on ideological grounds. You'll note that most linguists who propose a latin etymology are from a period when our Latin-ness was a national obsetion. There are many documented instances when respected scholars have ignored obvious etymologies in favour of Latin ones that were far less likely.

Given the geographic spread of the term Korochun and its meaning and the fact that its phonetic evolution is far more natural than a hypothetical *creationem* (the only other theory with any merrit), I'd bet my money on Krochun.

The European Court of Human Rights, and the European Court of Justice will increase in power and its mandate will be significantly broadened. National Courts will still exist, as they do now, but will eventually removed from the control of sovereign states. The creation of a European Constitution, (Within 10 years) that embodies the European ideals; democracy, freedom, social provision (health care, nationalised systems) and law and order. This will become ratified by all states within 20 years.

Ukraine, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, Lichtenstein, and Turkey will have formally joined the EU. Some non-European nations seek to further integrate with the EU. (Possible name change, but unlikely)

Creation of the Common Energy Policy, a single power system which connects throughout Europe ensuring a safe, secure, cheap and sustainable energy network. Increased use of Nuclear power (possibly Fusion), thermal, wind, solar, wave, tidal, biological and numerous other sources to ensure Europe is self reliant. 

Creation of a unified European foreign policy and defence force/military. The Common Security and Defence Policy is a step towards this, however I believe in 10 years that the EU will create a substantial defence force, however national defence forces will still exist. (Think of it like NATO for the EU) Within 30 years however national defence forces will be disbanded and be embedded into a European Defence Force (EDF) or some similar name. 

The Common Agriculture and Fishery Policy will be repealed within 10 years and updated to the changing economic and environmental situation within Europe and across the Globe. 

The EU will be fully recognised as a single nation state within 50 years, and possibly become the largest economy in the world. Competing with the US and China for the top spot. It will also be the third most populous state, after China and India, it will be the most densely populated state. As a result of having a very high standard of living, it will also have a high immigration issue. While this does cause tension, it is not a major issue as the US, China, India, Brazil, Australia and many other nations have relatively similar standard of living. 

During this entire time the world would have changed significantly as well. However the likelihood of WW3 is unlikely, but perhaps a small Cold War 2 is possible. 

I may add more, but then it would be moving away from Europe towards the UN, and the Unified North American Union, and a South East Asian Union etc...

&gt;*breaking the spirit of taxation*

read this:

&gt;*Yes, it is true that Amazon pays a lower rate of corporation tax by basing itself in Luxembourg, and Google and Facebook in Ireland. But doing this is not a sign of corporate chicanery or crafty lawyers exploiting loopholes; rather it is the very point of the Single Market (articles 26, 28, 49, 54 and 56 of the basic European Union Treaty). A company that wants to sell to all 27 EU countries needs to have its European headquarters in only one EU state. VAT is charged (except, oddly, on digital goods) where the delivery is made to, and corporation tax is levied on where that single brass plate is. As HMRC has recently pointed out, this is not avoidance, this is just the way corporation tax works.*

&gt;*It is true that Amazon has warehouses in the UK but we also have a double taxation treaty with Luxembourg — as we have with many other countries — which states that tax is not chargeable on the profits made from sales from warehouses and logistics chains.*

&gt;*It is true that Starbucks pays royalties to a Dutch company, thus apparently dodging UK tax. But EU law (council directive 2003/49/EC ) states that such royalty payments within the EU are not only allowed — it forbids the taxation of the payments in the country sending them.*

&gt;*These companies are not making a mockery of our tax laws: they are obeying the rules and regulations in each and every particular. They are not even avoiding tax, as these companies are doing specifically what the law intends, even to the point that we have laws that forbid national governments from stopping these multinationals doing what they have been doing*

Now: who are you to discern the 'true' spirit of the matter, when it's contrary to the letter of the law and to the UK tax authority's explicit statement that this doesn't constitute even tax avoidance?

Find another bandwagon. This one's not going anywhere.

When I visited some Weihnachtsmärkte last year, my knowledge of German Christmas carols was still somewhat... limited. Suddenly they started playing ""Oh, Tannenbaum"", and my friends decided to sing along. I didn't know the lyrics, but didn't want to be left out, so I accompanied them with [this version from The Simpsons](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7cdNVdu8lA), telling them that those where the Spanish lyrics for the song. A rough translation (I'm too lazy to look for the original English version) would be:
*Today is the day, today is the day, of the Beating | We will hit them a lot, until they spit out their hearts. | And we will hit them with sticks, until we break their spines.* 

They were delighted and made me teach them. I did. I suppose I will tell them the truth, someday. I'm evil.

This land rightfully belongs to civilians who were living there peacefully in the north of Cyprus until 1974 when armed invaders killed the civilians and forced them off the land, making them into refugees. Then, the invaders set up military bases and stationed 40,000 troops in this invaded territory, and brought over 100,000 settlers from eastern turkey illegally to alter the demographics of the island. They set up fences and blockaded the territory from the rest of the island, so nobody could enter or leave. 

How is this justifiable to you? What argument can you use to say we cannot claim it as our own?

So....basically what you are saying is......

1. Invade somebody else's land and make them into a refugee.

2. Occupy it for enough time to pass so that you can claim it as your own.

3. Claim it as your own.

I believe you mean our **francophilic** period.

&gt; There are many documented instances when respected scholars have ignored obvious etymologies in favour of Latin ones that were far less likely.

Many of the ""obvious"" etymologies of romanian words are the result of balkanism, claiming the word is of slavic/turkish/hungarian/greek/albanian origin whenever a latin etymon cannot be found, and especially when a cognate or homophone is present in our neighbours' languages (not that they actually need one since a lot of times fantasmagorical etymons from unattested proto-languages are shamelessly proposed), most of the times this is done completely disregarding meaning of either word. Which by the way, is what our neighbours do as well. They're ""obvious"" in the same sense that romanian *beat* and *fire* are ""obviously"" derived from their english ~~homophones~~ homographs, i.e. an utterly ludicrous proposition.

Germans? A small sense of rivalry but much more respectful. A sense that Germany plays by the same rules we do and that makes them easy to like. World War one had many here in ""high society"" questioning if we were on the right side. World War II was inevitable, and a really unique case.

Where I come from, we're taught that an argument is completely invalid without some form of factual evidence or it is just biased/opinionated/sensationalist crap. If you argue without this then you are arguing in a dome that is excluded from the outside world.

""Not necessarily, but is needed"" So needed =/= necessary?? I could swear they were the same.

&gt;EU is needed for this. Not necessarily, but is needed. Investors are more interested in the EU as a whole to invest, than, for example, a small country, like, Slovenia or Latvia.

Investors go to where the money is. It won't matter if the EU is unified or not, they will go to the region that has money.

""Maybe, to evade extreme nationalism/mild nationalism?"" We haven't had a European war in ages and there isn't any signs of it occurring again. (The Balklans was/is a problem with ethnicity and not political.) So why would we need federalism to stop something that isn't going to happen.

&gt;Environmental problems can only be fixed at the EU level.

Again. I can't really argue against this because what am I to say to something that is so ambiguous and outright as this? If you can give some statistics then I'll gladly do some research on the matter and see if anything says otherwise, but at the moment I could easily just say ""Environmental problems can never be fixed at the EU level.""

&gt;Having a single military certainly would be a plus

This is the only thing that I think that Europe can't continue without and that is some form of a unified military because I hate the idea of countries 'riding on the back of' countries like the UK or France. The UK and France account for a small proportion of Europe and yet they are Europe's only power projecting nations. If more countries (say in Eastern Europe) pulled their weight more then I think it would be far better.

Don't get me wrong, I'm absolutely for a non-federal EU and military is a big factor for me. But when the pro-EU side completely sweeps the other side into the umbrella of being ""misinformed"" and ""stupid"" then it just breeds hypocrisy and arrogance. Alot of the cynicism that has arose from the UK on the EU has actually predicted many of its downfalls and yet the UK is still seen as 'just some stupid, annoying child'. Ironically, it just shows how ""misinformed"" people like LostInACave can be.

We rarely say ""Mutlu noel bayramları""(Happy cristmas holidays.) It unnecessary and sounds a little strange. Also without a sentence its meaningless to use plural form. Actually its true for most holidays like in ""Mutlu ramazanlar.""(Happy ramadans.) its plural but ""Ramazan bayramımızı kutladı.""(He celebrated our ramadan holiday.) is not plural. ""Ramazan bayramlarımızı kutladı"" doesnt sound right and its unnecessary.
Also saying ""noel"" without ""bayramı"" is ok because noel implies the name of holiday itself but saying ""cumhuriyet"" instead of ""cumhuriyet bayramı"" is not ok because cumhuriyet just means republic.

&gt;numeroase cuvinte ale limbii române, printre care şi Crăciun, au pătruns în maghiară.

În general cuvintele românești intrate în limba maghiară tind să fie din domeniul păstoritului, dacă bine țin minte de la Marius Sala. Majoritatea cuvintelor comune sunt de origine slavonă, intrate în ambele limbi.

&gt;Din toate cele arătate în prezentul capitol rezultă că este vorba de un cuvînt străvechi, numai cuvintele care se găsesc de foarte multă vreme în limbă ajungînd să formeze expresii populare, să intre în compunerea unor proverbe, să contribuie la apariţia unor superstiţii, obiceiuri şi leacuri populare, să fie date ca nume unor plante etc.

În mare e valabil și pentru cuvântul *țigan* care numai „străvechi” nu e.

&gt;Conform dicţionarelor corespunzătoare pentru sărbătoarea Naşterii Domnului găsim echivalentele slave: [...] Cum se vede, Karácsony nu aduce nici de departe cu vreunul din aceste cuvinte, astfel că invocarea lor ca sursă posibilă pentru Karácsony nu se susţine.

Argument superficial, din moment ce cuvântul teoretic de la care provine se găsește și în alte limbi slave, fie cu același sens dar arhaic sau dialectal (precum în slovacă) sau cu sens ușor modificat, însemnând ceva legat de Crăciun, dar nu exact crăciunul (în Bulgaria se folosește în anumite zone pt Ajun, în Ucraina cu sensul de pîine de Crăciun, arhaic se folosea la Postul Crăciunului)

&gt;Însuşi Béla Bartók scrie: Das rumänische Material ist an Weinachtsliedern unvergleichlich reicher als das jenige der Nachbar völker (Materialul /muzical/ românesc privitor la cântecele de Crăciun este incomparabil mai bogat decît al tuturor popoarelor vecine), 56, p. VI.

Ăsta nu e argument lingvistic.

Scottish Student who recently finished my Advances Highers. 

Standard Grade History - Industrial Revolution (In Britain), Agriculture and lifestyle of such (Again Britain), Diseases, living conditions, wages etc (Essentially looking at the working class of Britain), First World War, but with a pretty wide focus. Looking at the causes of war, the political situations of the various countries, later on mainly focusing on weaponary, inventions (And their effect on battles) as well as the battles themselves. Fairly Britain central, it naturally could be argued. But then

Higher - The Italian Reunification (Garibaldi, Piedmonte, Austro-Hungarian Empire, all that good stuff), Hitler's Rise to Power, starting from immediately post WW1 Germany. Looking at the Weimar Republic, the various political parties, the economic situation, etc. A very in-depth look at society. And our final topic was Empire and migration. Essentially looking at the effect Scottish Migrants and Emigrants to Scotland had on their respective countries. (Scots in New Zealand, Australia, America, Canada, etc) and (Emigrants such as the Italians, Irish, Chinese, Lithuanians etc and their effects on Scotland). As well as looking at the effects on Scots on the British Empire (Glasgow Tea Trade, Clydesdale ship yards, etc)

Advanced Higher - American Civil War for the entire year.

So whilst standard grade might have been pretty Britain-centric, it could hardly be argued to be the case for the entire history education system. ",0,1356387687,null,0,false,0,c7lnmdc,t3_15db33,t1_c7lnmdc,t1_c7lglxc,null,1430762489,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Pai cam asta e problema. Nici macar in familia slava nu s-a pastrat un sens primar definitiv pentru *korochun* (si cumnatele sale din aceeasi familie) si presupusul sens ""initial"" de *craciun* nu a supravietuit in nici o limba slava dupa cum arata harta aia, deci nu cred ca sunt singurul care gaseste ceva cel putin suspect in teoria ca o sarbatoare pagana slava a fost absorbita de crestinism si a iesit pe partea celalata cu acelasi nume in timp ce asta nu s-a intamplat la slavi. Ceva nu e bine aici. Plus ca in romana sunt multe lucruri bizare legate de craciun, de exemplu faptul ca e un nume propriu destul de comun.

I would say that a very significant part of PP's electorate and leadership is made up of those who accepted Franco and the heirs of that people. I am not talking about strong supporters and ideological admirers, but about those who didn't care very much about living under Franco's Regime, the kind of people that said (and still say): ""you lived very well as long as you did't get into politics"".

Anyway, the Popular Party is a big collection of different and sometimes conflicting ideologies, ranging from old Francoists, to Catholic Conservatives and including the so-called ""Liberals"" (as in Tea Party liberal). I would say that the success of the Popular Party lies on their ability not to compromise and cater to this wide range of ideologies. For example, some of their voters support a big welfare state while some others prefer a smaller Reagan-style government.

Anyway, going back to the Franco point, I should say that none of the people that I know that vote ore even belong to the PP are Francoists, neither they pursue any Fascist or anti-democratic ideal. However, I would say that none of them are the kind of person that would have fought or protested for Democracy in Franco's times. Although there is a certain lack of democratic culture in Spain, I think that calling any conservative Francoist is mostly a meme and a mean to avoid debate or trying to consider the opponents' views. Of course many conservatives display this very same attitude. In my opinon, calling names never helps.

Les pâtissiers réclamèrent contre cet usage et intentèrent même un procès aux boulangers comme usurpant leurs droits. Sur leur requête, le parlement rendit, en 1713 et 1717, des arrêts qui interdisaient aux boulangers de faire et de donner, à l’avenir, aucune espèce de pâtisserie, d’employer du beurre et des œufs dans leur pâte, et même de dorer leur pain avec des œufs. La défense n’eut d’effet que pour Paris et l’usage prohibé continua d’exister dans la plupart des provinces.

&gt; Cool, then give me a previous example where the President of the US issued a death warrant for a citizen and his child. Hint: you won't find one because this is unprecedented.

You do realise that the civil war had hundreds of thousands of your own countrymen killed?

&gt; You don't think extrajudicial murder counts as an attack?

On the person involved? Yes.
On the populace as a whole? No.

&gt; And if you want to live in a place where the government will keep you safe your only choice is North Korea.

Nice black-and-white bullshit. You're the one who wants zero ""intrusion"". I didnt say that I wanted the government to be in every orifice of my life, did I? 

The fact of the matter is that Somalia is the only country on the planet that provides full ""freedom"".

&gt; Yet still not anything close to ""often""

Gun homicides where innocents are killed account for a tenth of all gun homicides. That's very oft-

&gt; , given the number of guns and incidence of ownership.

Again, 60% of guns are owned by 25% of the population. Saying ""but look how few have been used"" is insanely disingenuous.

&gt; If by that you mean analysis of your argument, then yes.

No. It's a bullshit strawman coupled with a little projection. Did I stutter?

&gt; Yes you have. If you're going to dismiss any real-world evidence that's harmful to your case then I will do the same to yours.

More bullshit and more projection. *You* haven't provided a single bit of evidence apart from simple-minded anecdotes. But hey, we both know it's because the evidence isn't on your side. Have you bothered reading the papers I linked to yet?

&gt; Again, stop trying to claim I said something I didn't. It's childish. If you wish to intentionally misinterpret what I say that's your business. But lying isn't an effective strategy on the internet.

Lay out what you ""meant"", then. You wrote that they count as ""failures"", all the while ignoring the lower gun homicide rates. Only logical output of that is you thinking that they claim to remove all gun homicides, which isn't true.

&gt; No I didn't. Christ, learn to read. Or how to not lie.

You wrote;

&gt; This is not me ""strawmanning gun control by pretending that it claims to stop all gun violence"".

And then..

The failure is that they only slightly lower gun homicide rates. Trading a fundamental human right for a false sense of security is a failure.

&gt; And did the President call out an individual hit on any of them? Nothing in the conduct of war is comparable to specifically calling out a hit on an individual and denying him his due process rights.

Considering that Drones are bombing Yemen and Pakistan ""at war"" is pretty apt right now. The only difference is that most civilians aren't actually witnessing it.

You've said point blank that gun control is a failure.

&gt; And the fact of the matter is that North Korea is the only country on the planet that runs your life for you. The rest of the world lies on a spectrum between the two extremes, and I'd prefer it if people like you didn't try to drag my country to collectivist one.

See, this is the only valid argument against gun control. That of freedom. The only issue is that freedom tends to come at a price.

The entirety of the problem faced by the eurozone is due to a balance of payments crisis: in short german unit-costs are too competitive vis-a-vis its neighbours which exports jobs and borrowed money from those neighbours into germany.

As the largest economic unit within the eurozone, and the most damagingly competitive, if germany is serious about saving the currency union it needs to inflate away its labour cost advantage by increasing spending and benefits, encouraging german consumers to spend and allowing neighbouring countries to sell.

If germany is intending to introduce the largest post-war austerity package after in 2014 it doesn't bode well for its commitment to the eurozone. It will lock club-med into yet more years of huge unemployment through grinding internal devaluation.

I won't give you the Canadian view on Americans, because its quite similar to yours (and the list above!).

So, the English Canadians and French Canadians have a weird relationship:

Firstly, there is a stereotype that French people are snooty assholes.

Honestly, I've met about 6 French people in my life.

The three French Canadians are all my friends, all fluent in Quebec French. Oddly, they all tell me that ""French people are assholes"" and the ""French are the biggest dicks on the planet"". This, I laughed along with them about. But, seeing as they're all French Canadian, and they're slandering the French Canadians, I was confused -
These three guys are *all* some of the nicest kids I knew in high school. Super polite, always ready for a laugh. Quite the opposite auf ein Arschloch.

1 was a boy from Normandy - super funny - super polite.

Are you saying that the Greeks are worse off than Africa? 

Why, btw, which you haven't answered, did Greece lie about the Euro? Why did the Greeks decided not to follow the rules? Why are they so bad at paying taxes? And, why are they so corrupt? 

Shouldn't Greece answer to the same standards as everyone else in Europe? In other words, why on earth should poorer countries like Estonia pay for them when Estonia has worked their ass off to get in to the Euro and follow the rules, while they were not even a country 20 years ago?

What have Greece been doing? Why haven't the Greeks bothered to fight the corruption? Why are they so bad at paying taxes? Why haven't they bothered to increase their productivity?

Why, should anyone but the Greeks be responsible for the Greek dilemma. We certainly didn't caused it.

How is that a failure of Sweden. We have done what *we* could. We have followed the rules, we have fought against the CAP and the Swedes have consistently voted for politicians who are trying to improve our finances by paying off debt, increase productivity, balance the budget etc.

When what the last time the Greeks voted for that in the last 20 years. They have consistently voted for people who give them easy jobs, lower the taxes, etc. They are a part of that.


&gt;It is amusing that you're all for giving money to African states but not to member states that don't behave much differently on the fiscal plane than those african states.

You are so naive, it is all Africa to you I assume. You haven't heard about the financial explosion that is happening in sub Saharan Africa, have you? Do you even know the difference between Malawi and Botswana? Botswana for example, pretty low corruption, and AIDS medicine makes a difference. Rather than paying off the Greeks who consistently has voted for the easiest way out, I want my money to HIV research for example. 

Oh, so the Greeks should then have the *lowest* debt in Europe.

I am Swedish, what on earth are you talking about ""White Mans Burden/Guilt"". Are you referring to all of our colonies.

It does, and if you want to contest that, then you'd need to prove your suspicions.

&gt; They are not giving me more than a boolean value here. I wouldn't call it ""keeping it a secret"" as much as ""not disclosing it"".

Did you even read it? Below the graph they cited [this](http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/07/20/the-worst-mass-shootings-of-the-past-50-years/), [this](http://o.canada.com/2012/07/17/interactive-map-mass-shootings-in-north-american-history/) and [this](http://www.nycrimecommission.org/initiative1-shootings.php).

&gt; No, I'm assuming they're biased because for the last six years at least they have been extremely biased. It's a biased publication that caters to a biased, extreme worldview. It's the Breitbart of the left.

Based on?

&gt; So you're pointing to undeclared wars in your effort to prove that the US isn't sliding towards tyranny?

No. You stated that what was going on in war was incomparable - the US has been in a very vocal ""war against terrorism"" for quite some time now.
&gt; Ten years ago the President hadn't ever maintained hit lists. Things are changing for the worse and our first Nero may be in charge soon. We need options, and guns provide them.

In the information age your most deadly weapon is knowledge.

&gt; And you proceeded to intentionally misinterpret what I meant by ""failure"" as the dumbest possible position I could take

Nope, I've based everything on what you've written. You have stated that ""gun control"" is a failure. Not ""some measures of gun control"" but ""gun control"" itself.

&gt; 10% isn't ""often"". Charitably, 10% would be ""occasionally"". I would lean more towards ""infrequently"".

Three dead innocent people a day isn't infrequent.

&gt; I did. You provided a chart from a biased organization

The originals source was the Washington Post. Learn to read.

&gt;  and a series of studies that don't adequately account for the fundamental differences between the US and other countries, such as our drug war.

At least read the fucking link. One of the papers looked at guns amongst states.

&gt; Even assuimg those lives wouldn't have been taken by other means, that actually seems like a paltry reward in exchange for denying 22 million people a fundamental human right.

Gun regulation =/= gun bans.

&gt; Do you know what would save even more lives? Banning alcohol. 1,292 Australians died as a result of drunk driving last year.

No, because alcohol is addictive and would force people to resort to desperate means to acquire it. Keeping it legal saves more lives than keeping it illegal in this case.

&gt; No, you connected entirely different sections of my response in a pathetic attempt to continue misinterpreting what I say.

So you're illiterate after all. What you wrote was;

&gt; Yet still not anything close to ""often"", given the number of guns and incidence of ownership.

What I quoted was;

&gt; Yet still not anything close to ""often"",
&gt; given the number of guns and incidence of ownership.

No ""different sections"" about it.

&gt; I don't have to result to lies and misquoting to make my case here.

You did. See above.

&gt; I'm not the one creating the studies we're arguing about. If you present evidence that is clearly not objective, why do you think I must respect it or place it beyond scrutiny?

It's objective unless proven otherwise. Your conclusion is based on your assumption that you made up. Back up your assertions.

&gt; No, the ""crime"" would then be done with knives, bombs, and whatever guns can be smuggled in. Even if you could snap your fingers and instantly remove all guns in the US from existence, criminal elements would import new ones in hours.

As evidenced in the UK and Australia, your claims are bullshit. Those crimes weren't replaced because most of them would have been crimes of passion; the difference was that less guns would have been available and people weren't as deadly in the heat of the moment.

&gt; I'd have no problem with you owning bombs that never existed. But it's a moot point anyway, solved many posts ago when we discussed the ability to discriminate one's targets.

I already have. The page lacks details on the criteria involved.

&gt;Did you even read it? Below the graph they cited this[1] , this[2] and this[3] .

None of which provide the information I seek or that you base your argument on.

&gt;Based on?

Past experience reading its content. The general admission of its contributors. The consensus of pretty much everyone on the Internet. It's a lefty rag.

&gt;No. You stated that what was going on in war was incomparable - the US has been in a very vocal ""war against terrorism"" for quite some time now.

Yes, but it hasn't targeted US citizens until recently. And at any rate the whole ""War on Terror"" is further evidence of my argument that the general level of tyranny is increasing.

&gt;In the information age your most deadly weapon is knowledge.

Knowledge is actually less powerful than high explosives delivered in the form of a missile. Trite aphorisms aren't necessarily true. 

&gt;Nope, I've based everything on what you've written. You have stated that ""gun control"" is a failure. Not ""some measures of gun control"" but ""gun control"" itself.

So this is you admitting you're intentional misinterpreting what I've written and have been bashing a strawman?

&gt;Three dead innocent people a day isn't infrequent.

In a country of 300,000,000 people it is.

&gt;The originals source was the Washington Post. Learn to read.

Which also didn't provide the information I require. 

&gt;At least read the fucking link. One of the papers looked at guns amongst states.

Which are also impossible to directly compare due to the geographical burden of the war on drugs.

&gt;Gun regulation =/= gun bans.

Private gun ownership is, for all intents and purposes, banned in those countries. That limitation of personal ownership is kind of what your argument hinges on, after all.

&gt;No, because alcohol is addictive and would force people to resort to desperate means to acquire it. Keeping it legal saves more lives than keeping it illegal in this case.

And people have never resorted to desperate means to acquiring guns. If you're going to make your argument from the perspective of lives saved at least be consistent here: guns, alcohol, tobacco, cars, fast food, and skydiving should all be banned.

&gt;So you're illiterate after all. What you wrote was;

Now you pathetically confused or pathetically disingenuous. Our argument over the meaning of ""often"" is quite separate from the argument in which you attempted to conjoin bits of separate paragraphs of one of my responses into a new sentence I never wrote.

&gt;No ""different sections"" about it.

[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/14wlp6/reading_about_the_conneticut_massacre_as_a/c7lu6j6) is where you attempted to conjoin two separate bits of what I wrote into one sentence, liar.

&gt;It's objective unless proven otherwise. Your conclusion is based on your assumption that you made up. Back up your assertions.

That Mother Jones is a biased rag is not something I just made up. I would have similar suspicions of any study commissioned by Fox News or other such organizations.

&gt;As evidenced in the UK and Australia, your claims are bullshit. Those crimes weren't replaced because most of them would have been crimes of passion

And crimes of passion can only be committed with guns. Ok...

&gt;the difference was that less guns would have been available and people weren't as deadly in the heat of the moment.

Of course they would be. The only thing the lack of guns could prevent would be mass shootings, which still happen in countries with strict gun control. Therefore, gun control does almost nothing to prevent violent crime.

&gt;Either the object is to blame or it isn't.

It isn't. But for some reason you think this cancels the argument over the discriminatory nature of the weapons in question. It doesn't. A nuclear weapon, even used responsibly, will kill innocent bystanders and cause significant environmental trouble. Guns don't have either of these properties.

&gt;The evidence suggests that it's a yes for both those categories

Stop trying to put words in my mouth. It's childish.

true,AntisocialScientist,NRHW,U. A. M. R.,"While Deutsche Bahn is 100% state-owned, the government ""only"" owns 32% of the Telekom (17% via the KfW, 15% directly).

Since the European Commission is planning on taking Deutsche Bahn apart (arguing that one company shouldn't own Germany's rail network and the majority of trains travelling on it at the same time), one way to look at this is; making sure the state gets out of its DB stock before it becomes worthless. As for the Telekom, I got nothing, although it might very well be the same, since they own the phone and internet lines and are a service provider of their own at the same time.*

One can also wonder whether the Eurocrisis has arrived in Germany, since selling off state companies is something that we have recommended to crisis-ridden southern European states.*

This is as good a time as any to discuss whether doing so is a good thing for the customer. I'd argue that service is bound to get worse when a state monopoly such as the Bahn, the Post or the Telekom is privatised because of the double whammy of 'responsibility to the shareholders' (and the shareholders only) and 'lack of competition' (of course, when the EC smashes the monopolies afterwards, all is well).

Can't they do as France does - you have SNCF (state owned) which in turn owns the network through its RFF subsidiary. IIRC it's just that track and trains have to be owned by separate entities, it doesn't matter that the same parent might own both of those.

I think the UK is the only country to have really exhausted it - the state owns the track, stations and runs the network with private companies running the trains. Several companies get franchise agreements to run trains over parts of the network, and in places there are ""open access' companies who think they can fill a niche in the market that doesn't exist. Deutsche Bahn owns several franchises.

&gt; I'd argue that service is bound to get worse when a state monopoly such as the Bahn, the Post or the Telekom is privatised because of the double whammy of 'responsibility to the shareholders' (and the shareholders only) and 'lack of competition' (of course, when the EC smashes the monopolies afterwards, all is well). 

You can still introduce competition. BT (Deutsche Telekom's British equivalent) still owns its network but it had to put it into a separate subsidiary with different management from its retail arm. We have a pretty competitive telecoms industry.

It hasn't worked so well for Royal Mail though - other companies cherry pick the profitable parts of the country, and (because of law) pay Royal Mail to deliver to the unprofitable parts because they're the only company that has to do it.

The railways and stations would remain public! The trains would be operated by private companies, with fair competition, which currently doesn't exist.

Telekom is a really aweful company, it is not competitive anymore due to their completely overpriced services. Telekom should have gone bust in 2001 already, but was kept afloat by the government, costing the taxpayers billions!

So, the government should sell these companies, in order to avoid further losses. Moreover, It really doesn't affect the people if it is state run or not. In some cases, such as water treatment etc. it is wise to let the government run these services.

They're all privately structured, although Bahn's IPO got cancelled as you said. There are plenty of private railway companies, although most are local or have cherry-picked only a few connections (including SNCF).

I don't have a problem with selling off the remaining state-owned shares, with a few exceptions (see below), but I'd rather keep them as long as we don't need the money or until we can sell them at a better price. The ridiculous amount we (tax payers) got for Telekom shows that there are better times to do something like this. Rösler wants to sell for no reason but out of principle and to be able to claim a balanced budget before the elections, there's no immediate need to raise money at the moment.

What I would have a problem with would be the sale of DB Netze, the network subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn. Some of those tracks just can't be profitable, but maintaining them is still important for the towns and regions they service, and closing them down would cost society more than the nominal cost of keeping them. Instead, I'd rather see prices for the use of the network well-regulated. I'd also have an issue with the sale of Deutsche Flugsicherung (air traffic safety), for hopefully obvious reasons.

I could add that more research on an european level could allow european companies to produce new goods. Airbus is a good example of this.
