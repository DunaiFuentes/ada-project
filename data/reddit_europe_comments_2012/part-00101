From [this](http://www.loonwatch.com/2011/12/gil-ronens-fabricated-statistics-about-oslo-rapists-being-all-muslim/) other source:

""Statistics regarding assault rapists:

The Oslo Police District has given a report of rapes in Oslo in 2010. The report shows that for all types of rape, except assault rape, European perpetrators are in the majority, and they are mostly Norwegian. Assault rapes covers only five identified unique person. These have all a foreign origin. The number is however, so low that it does not provide a basis for drawing conclusions with regard to country of origin. Two of them were very young (under 18) and two had severe psychiatric diagnoses and cannot be regarded as representative of their ethnic culture. It is highlighted in the report that generalizations like “Oslo’s rapists are foreigners”, which have been seen in media, are wrong. The report gives no statistics regarding religion of rapists.”
Yours Sincerely,
Grethe Kleivan
Deputy Director General""


From [here](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/25/world/europe/in-norway-gender-equality-does-not-extend-to-the-bedroom.html?pagewanted=all), 

*“The statistics tell us that the safest place for women is outside, on the street — most rapes happen at home,” said Tove Smaadahl, general manager of the Shelter Movement. In a 2005 survey by the Norwegian Institute for Urban and Regional Research, 9 percent of female respondents in a relationship reported experiencing sexual assault.*

[...]

*These findings challenge widely held notions that partner rape is the most difficult to prosecute. Instead, as chronicled in the 2009 report, prosecution and conviction rates look deeply biased: Forty percent of rapes in which the perpetrator did not know the victim but was successfully identified were prosecuted, with conviction rates of more than 70 percent. By contrast, only 14 percent of suspects in partner rape were convicted. Suspects of immigrant origin were particularly likely to be punished.

“The more closely the suspect fits our stereotypical rapist, the more likely he is to be convicted,” said Ms. Kelly.*


There is nothing more annoying than twisting statistics to prove your point.

true,rimo,null,null,"&gt;The lack of intergration is totally caused by our immigrants and is directly linked to their socio-economic status

As the son of an immigrant that immigrated well before policies on immigrants were loose, people will just behave how you allow them too, and take the easy way. That's human behaviour, not immigrant behaviour.

My father, for instance, immigrated from Cyprus, to marry with my Dutch mother. Nowadays that is not a problem at all, but back then my mother had to vouch for him financially. He got no hand-outs. 

My mother, as a feminist, in turn demanded that my father would become an independent citizen, and she contributed to his study, while at the same time he started to clean toilets to earn money for himself and his study too. My mother didn't want him to be dependent on her, just like she wouldn't want to be dependent on a man.

Now, my father has been teaching mathematics in high school, and is thus of value to society. He strongly believes that hard work got him there, and he is right, but part of the reason is that he **had** to go there, he was **steered** in that direction. There was incentive to take that direction. 

*Being incentivized is something that works for all humans, not just for immigrants.*

We're not special noble creatures that do things out of love because we are not immigrants. When a non-immigrant is of no value of society because he never had the incentive to be that way, it's not that big of a problem all of a sudden.

It's not as culture can't be changed. Culture exist because an environment makes people adopt certain habits, and in turn the environment changes because of culture.

* Raise awareness!

This sounds stupid, but as a guy I never realized how much this happend.. Because I don't get catcalled (duh!) and when I am with women, the women don't get catcalled (I assume because they are with me?).

I think a great part of Europeans does not think this is okay. And if people say 'come on suck it up' I think they are not aware of how harrassing it is.
I always thought it happend like once a week, comeing from stupid 16-year-olds trying to look cool, just whisteling once or so. I never realized how fear inducing and harrassing it actually is.

* Secondly I think people should be motivated to look out for this behaviour (I know I will now) and maybe somehow show these people how unwanted it is.

I didn't really work this one out, because it shouldn't be patronizing. We can't really 'protect' the women to feel more safe, because I assume that would still make the women feel powerless and stupid. So I have no idea what to do really

* Lastly, take legal steps

I think this behaviour should fall under harrassment (in several countries it alrady does I am sure) and should be targeted by police. Hefty fines, let police be on the lookout for this, encourage women to report this, encourage people to testify etc.

true,RedZupp,null,null,"Das ganze ist eine beschissene, aufgebauschte Sommerlochgeschichte, die es im normalen Tagesgeschäft nicht mal in die Kurzmeldungen geschafft hätte. Nichtsdestotrotz zeigt sich hier mal wieder schön, wie kaputt unsere Gesellschaft ist. 

Fangen wir doch mal am Anfang an: Da kommt eine Pressemitteilung, dass eine Ruderin das olympische Dorf verlassen hat, weil der Mannschaftsleitung ""Erkenntnisse zum privaten Umfeld der Ruderin Nadja Drygalla"" bekannt wurden und es danach zu einem Gespräch kam, in dessen Verlauf die junge Frau erklärte, dass sie das olympische Dorf verlassen werde, um keine Belastung darzustellen. Soweit so schlecht, sollte man meinen und das die Geschichte damit gegessen wäre. 

Falsch gedacht, lieber wird eine Hexenjagd veranstaltet und die Gesinnungswächter der Republik erkennen eine ausgezeichnete Gelegenheit moralischen *high ground* zu gewinnen. Wo finden wir das Gros dieser Gesinnungswächter in Deutschland? Richtig, links der Mitte, je weiter desto besser, denn entgegen des selbstinszenierten Opfer- und Märtyrermythos, mit dem sich die Vertreter dieser Zunft gerne umgeben, ist gerade der Medienmainstream in Deutschland deutlich links gefärbt. Populärster Vertreter: Spiegel Online. SPON bringt es fertig, in kaum 2 Tagen, etwa 8 Artikel zusammenzuschreiben... Echter Qualitätsjournalismus (übrigens genau wie bei der Syrienberichterstattung...)

Nun könnte die Presse viel schreiben und morgen schon würde kein Hahn mehr danach krähen, aber Gott sei Dank gibt es auch in der Politik noch aufrechte WächterInnen (Gender-Auge sei wachsam) der Demokratie, die blitzschnell den drohenden moralischen Bankrott der Republik erkennen und ihre Meinung kundtun. In diesem Fall in Gestalt des ehemaligen SED-Mitgliedes und jetzigen Linken-Abgeordneten Petra Pau. Frau Pau warnt uns, dass diese Erkenntnisse ja schon länger bekannt wären und dass da ""etwas oberfaul sei"". Danke Frau Pau, jetzt fühle ich mich viel besser. Sie bestimmt auch, da war das Studium an der Partei-Hochschule Karl-Marx ja nicht umsonst. Es ist gut zu wissen, dass die überlebenden VertreterInnen des letzten totalitären Regimes auf deutschem Boden mich darüber aufklären können, wann die Demokratie in Gefahr ist und wer dafür verantwortlich ist. Das ist an Glaubwürdigkeit ja kaum zu überbieten!

Apropos Glaubwürdigkeit - warum ist das ganze eigentlich hochgekocht? Ich mag mich täuschen (und dann möge mich jemand korrigieren), aber [das hier](http://kombinat-fortschritt.com/2012/08/01/mecklenburgische-neonazifreundin-bei-olympischen-spielen/) habe ich als Ur-Quelle gefunden. Nun glaube ich nicht, dass jemand in der Mannschaftsleitung des Olympiateams sich auf der Seite rumgetrieben hat. Irgendjemand wird darauf gestoßen sein und damit zum Innenministerium gelaufen sein und Anfragen gestellt haben, bzw. gleich noch Tipps an seine Freunde in der Politik gegeben haben (Gell Petra, das war ja alles schon so lange bekannt... Warum dann eigentlich erst jetzt die Aufregung?). Gerüchte und Halbwissen reichen scheinbar neuerdings aus, um jemanden zu verurteilen. 

Diese Art der menschenunwürdigen Behandlung und Vorverurteilung aufgrund von gefährlichem Halbwissen, die unter der Ägide einer angeblichen moralischen Überlegenheit betrieben wird, ekelt mich an. Sie ekelt mich an, angefangen bei Leuten, die die Welt in Ihresgleichen, Nazis und Spießer unterteilen und eine 23-jährige Ruderin mit den Terroristen des NSU gleichsetzen, bis hin zu Leuten, die Vertreter eines Unrechtsregimes waren, sich einen Scheiß um die Aufarbeitung der eigenen Verbrechen kümmern und nun glauben, sie müssten rechte Verschwörungen an jeder Ecke aufklären und mir vorschreiben, welche Weltsicht die richtige ist.

Das Leben von Nadja Drygalla ist ruiniert, soviel steht fest. Warum? Zum Teil ist sie daran selbst Schuld (ob bewusst oder aus Naivität sei dahingestellt), zum Teil ist sie Opfer des medialen Sommerlochs, zum Teil ist sie aber auch Opfer einer selbstgerechten Weltsicht, persönlicher Feigheit (der Verantwortlichen, die sich möglichst schnell aus der Schusslinie bringen wollten) und einer politisch motivierten Hexenjagd.",0,1344095743,null,0,false,0,c5o3tvd,t3_xngpj,t1_c5o3tvd,t3_xngpj,null,1429551274,5,false,de,t5_22i0,5

I am a german military vet. I used to be an officer, back for the story to come I was an ensign.

Early in the 2000s the USA went to war in the Iraq, and due to stuff and shortcomings, they asked germany to guard their bases in germany.

I was a shift-comander of Darmstadt base during that time. So, I know the base, back then, we were housed inside the base, used the bases mess hall, and basically got to know shit.

I had a 12 man team on each 8 hour shift, and most, even if just enlisted, were ok with what you did in Iraq and why.

However, your bases attitude pissed most of us off. You are in germany as a military unit, you are guarded by german military. You did not know our ranks and could not identify them, this pissed us off.

In the beginning most US-troops did not respect german troops guarding. 6'5"" me purposly stepped in and delivered a verbal beatdown to those, less problems later. Your MP was very helpful there and backed us once they knew us. Later less problems.

Inside the base most guys were really nice and cool. Still today, I do not know why the shit at guardpost.

&gt; 1/ You have a bike

I *brought* a bike.  

&gt; 2/ You even know how to brake using retropedaling

Yes, but I have Sweden to thank for that.

&gt; 4/ Eating 7 slides of bread for lunch doesn’t scare you anymore

Getting there, but still not quite (thankfully).

&gt; 5/ By the way, you stopped eating warm lunch. You just eat bread

Never! You can't make me. 

&gt; 7/ It doesn’t surprise you anymore to eat at 18:30

Sadly, true.


&gt; 12/ You used to use cash all the time, but now you have a pin card

I no longer carry cash, ever. 

&gt; 13/ You think ducks are cute

Not me.

&gt; 14/ As soon as the sun pops out, you make a barbecue, even if it’s 10°C outside
&gt; 15/ You think 15°C is warm

Not quite there yet, but the assimilation is under way. Currently, if there's sun, the urge to go for a walk in the city becomes unbearable. No barbecueing though.

&gt; 17/ You don’t remember what a moutain looks like

I heard there's even a mountain climbers associaton! 

&gt; 18/ You still don’t know how to speak Dutch. But your English has improved

Completely true (and I'm sorry for not learning your language yet).

&gt; 25/ You’re ok with having only one flavour of ice cream (the white ones)

The temperature does not permit ice cream consumption, don't kid yourselves!

&gt; 26/ You don’t even bother to ask “do you speak English?”, you just speak English right away

Some people don't! It's rare but it happens. I still ask a fair amount of time.

&gt; 31/ You know how to repair a bike

With swindling bike shops costing a fortune and doing a crappy job, you need to.

&gt; 32/ You eat potatoes at least once a day

Not there yet. 

&gt; 33/ You always check the weather before leaving home

That took some getting used to.

&gt; 34/ You know what it is being late and having to wait for a boat to cross the bridge

:( 

&gt; 36/ Sometimes, you only drink milk as lunch

Sometimes? More like always. 

&gt; 41/ Being tall gets a new meaning

Went home for the summer, I realised how much I enjoy looking at other people at eye-level. 

&gt; 47/ You start to think that the strange position of the hole in the WC is not that disgusting

It's helpful for medical reasons (but still disgusting).

&gt; 49/ You have the AH bonus card

Even with the silly discounts, it's still too expensive.

&gt; 50/ Your windows have no curtains, and you don’t care

They do and I would care if they didn't. Even the Dutch have those blurry windows when they live on the ground floor. 

&gt; 52/ For you, light rain is not rain

Before going there, I thought the constant rain would be constant trouble. It took a while to get used to the concept of rain so light that it's only a minor annoyance. 

&gt; 53/ Professors write a “well done” comment in your assignment and still grade you with a 6

University grading scale: 

* 6 = you did a terrible job and I hate you but I'll pass you anyway
* 7 = normal grade for normal people
* 8 = exceptional, almost perfect
* 9 = perfect in every way, almost supernatural
* 10 = never awarded to anyone, never will, mwahahahahaha
 
&gt; 55/ 10°C is warm enough to wear a short or mini skirt

I didn't even *bring* shorts. 

&gt; 56/ You can ride your bike in the rain, wind and even snow

I called it quits and took the tram when it was -10 degrees. There's always next year!

&gt; 61/ “Alstublieft and dank u wel” are the only dutch words you know

Let's not forget about ""gratis"" and ""let op"".

&gt; 71/ You can never predict the weather and can not believe the weather forecast anymore

Need a site with hourly forecasts. 

&gt; 72/ You wait for the light to go green before crossing the street, even if there is no car

The Dutch don't do that. What they do is, they wait until they know that if they start *now*, by the time they reach the other side of the road, the light will be green. It's the perfect crime. (source: Dutch person I know)

&gt; 77/ Trees planted in straight rows/ aka the forest/ seems normal

There's probably just one real forest left in the country, named a world heritage site. Only way for it to survive, really. 

&gt; 80/ You think it is okay to eat multicoloured sprinkels on bread for breakfast

Noooooooooo. 

&gt; 81/ You use 9292ov.nl to go to the supermarket

I know someone that seems like he would be capable of doing that. 

&gt; 82/ You know that the wind blows in your face regardless of the direction in which you are biking

Rings true (but is probably just confirmation bias).

&gt; 84/ When you move out of your rental apartment, you know you might have to take the floors with you

Only heard stories about this.

&gt; 86/ You end up eating super greasy food at 5am at FEBO or ALEV (Delft)

Fast food in the Netherlands seems so bad that I have never even dared to try it.

&gt; 93/ You know getting a couch will be difficult because it doesn’t fit through the door. Windows maybe?

Good thing the movers will assist you by tying a rope on that hook on the roof and then pull. The couch dangling like crazy is how you know it's safe!

&gt; 95/ Jaap, Joost and Jeroen are the names of most of the Dutch guys you know

I've lived in the southern US (Virginia and Texas) for most of my life, and almost everything you wrote is 100% correct, except for the one quote above.  The situation of black people has greatly improved, even in my lifetime.  There are now parts of Houston (e.g., a portion of West Alabama St.) and parts of other cities (e.g., Harlem, New York) that were once ghettos but are now middle-class black neighborhoods.  

My parents live in a rich part of Houston, and when I was a child there, the police would follow the cars of any black person who drove through the neighborhood.  Now, when I visit my parents, I see black people who live in the neighborhoods and also some who work on the police force, and the area has become wealthier, not poorer.  

I remember people making derogatory comments about interracial relationships when I was younger; I haven't heard a comment like that in years, and interracial relationships are more common, or perhaps more publicly displayed,  than they used to be.  

There are also a lot of black Americans attending the University of Houston, which is a Tier 1 (best class) university.  

Black parents today increasingly stress the importance of hard work and education (they are also very religious).  The old attitude that black people can't get a fair shot, so why bother trying, is quickly ending, especially after Obama's election.

Here is an incident from King Ashoka's life who was crucial in spreading of Buddhism

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pu%E1%B9%A3yamitra_%C5%9Aunga#Academic_debate

&gt; “At that time, an incident occurred which greatly enraged the king. A follower of the Nirgrantha (Mahâvîra) painted a picture, showing Buddha prostrating himself at the feet of the Nirgrantha. Ashoka ordered all the Ajivikas of Pundravardhana (North Bengal) to be killed. In one day, eighteen thousand Ajivikas lost their lives. A similar kind of incident took place in the town of Pataliputra. A man who painted such a picture was burnt alive with his family. It was announced that whoever would bring to the king the head of a Nirgrantha would be rewarded with a dînâra (a gold coin). As a result of this, thousands of Nirgranthas lost their lives.”

Note that the Ajivikas belonged to the sect of Ashoka's father.

This bullcrap that only Christianity tolerates insanely violent behavior is widely believed by too many westerners. I am a Hindu, and every religion has its share of insane violent beliefs.

No not really. I guess I could google it but so could you. It's common sense to me that it would happen, because that cheap money would've gone somewhere else. Maybe we'd have another dotcom bubble, a commodities bubble or it would be something else.

Even with all your measures you could easily have a stock bubble that would result in pretty much the same consequences.

Spain and Ireland are free market economies, they must also respect European and international rules for the free movement of capitals, they do not have the tools at all.  
  
I don't really see how the area where the bubble appears matters, all it matters is the size of the bubble, and it would've been big anyway due to all this cheap credit or maybe you would have the same problem divided by many mini bubbles instead of a big one, either way it would probably happen and be as huge of a problem as the current one.

The problem with non-European rating agencies is that they don't understand Europe and how it works, from the functioning of the single market to European politics, and thus are unable to do rating correctly.

The inability of non-European rating agencies to understand what is going on is of course natural as the EU has made a great transforming leap in the past 20 years that has fundamentally changed the way how the whole continent lives and acts.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"It depends on how you count. The first Greek bailout package was €110bn, financed partially through bilateral loans by EZ countries, by the IMF, and the Greek Loan Facility. The second package was €130bn, financed through the EFSF, and the remaining funds form the first one got shifted to the EFSF as well. So, that's €240bn, of which I believe €30bn came from the IMF and the rest from EZ countries according to GDP/ECB share. Not all of it has been payed out yet (€35bn or so remaining? I'm not sure).  
Then there was the ""voluntary restructuring"", another €100bn (more if you include what Greece would have had to pay in interests), this time from the private sector. A part of that indirectly goes back to the public as well, because some affected banks need bailouts or have already been nationalized (e.g., through the ""bad bank"" that was created to deal with the HyperReal fiasco, tax payers lost close to €9bn in this).

Portugal is relatively straight forward. €78bn, split evenly between the EFSF, EFSM and IMF. Ireland's €85bn also have a share provided by the UK, AFAIK.

So, for a rough estimate, a country's share of the about €300bn provided by the EZ one way or another is about the same as it's share of the Eurozone's GDP, like [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Financial_Stability_Facility#Guarantee_commitments). The EZ's population is about 300 million, so about €1000 per capita on average. I don't want to do the math, because this would mean additional research and accounting for smaller effects such as the affected countries obviously not paying the share that they normally would have been assigned for their own bailout (i.e., Greece did not contribute to the Greek bailout, so the normal capital key you'll find for ECB's shareholders would have to be corrected first).

Also, exact figures of the bailout share would be misleading, because there are other factors that go into the cost. Those are loans, and a good chunk of it will eventually get payed back. Until then, there are interest payments, mostly they are set slightly above of what the providing countries or the EFSF have to pay to borrow the money themselves. Some of those contributions are raised by the EFSF and only guaranteed by the public.

Next, the crisis has various other effects that further complicate things immensely. Germany and a few others pay very low interest rates these days, on the debt they take on to provide the bailout financing but mostly on what they take out to service their own debt. For others, it's the opposite, sometimes dangerously so. And let's not even get into the various other negative effects on the European economy and intra-EU trade.",0,1344167951,null,0,false,0,c5oh2ws,t3_xotj4,t1_c5oh2ws,t1_c5oe9kr,null,1429557677,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

- 1) Spain had experiencing excesive levels of new home construction. Spain's real estate market now has an excessive inventory. The banks have too many houses and they are non willing to sell lowering the prices, because they will be admiting really big looses. The banks dont want to provide money to the companies so private companies are broken and firing people. Spain has a lot of internal problems like corruption, bad investements, and too many people that worked in construccion (and now they dont have work). Also the current government in Spain is the pp (something like the republicans but they defend monarchy) which is doing even worse than the previous government.

- 2) Spain is in EU (European Union). Spain has low inflation but hight unemploymenent. In this case Keynes (the economist that make USA great after WWII) shows that we need more investment to create employmenent. This invesmente should come from printing more money (wich devaluates the currency). But Germany(Merkel) does not needs/wants a devaluation of the euro. Probably this is no accident, Merkel wants to impose her economic vision on Europe while making Germany stronger, and will use every economic weapon to force the South of Europe to do her will.

The EU is a flop. Mundell (Nobel in economics) made ​​this clear in 1961: A monetary union (euro) involves removing the exchange rate: it will undermine the economy. To avoid this have to be vaccinated with certain adjustments (EU should be more like USA). These settings are not met, so that EU does not behave as a country. Thus a policy may favor Germany and Spain hurt. The opposite policy would harm Germany but Spain (and Greece) would he needed.

Islam also strictly bans the consumption of alcohol, and yet Mohammed Atta, the head of the 9/11 hijackers, was an alcoholic and pounded shots in a bar prior to 9/11, while other hijackers visited strip joints.

In the end, I always find myself having to admit that politically incorrect answer might just be the correct one.

The single strongest experience I have is of the time when me and my family went to visit some of my paternal relatives up in Uppsala. My father and his family hail from Karbala, a very conservative Shiite city in southern Iraq, with most of my paternal relatives being equally conservative as consequence. This became apparent to me when I and my other male cousins went down into the stairwell storage to get some bicycles out and a girl came in and went up the stairs. She was dressed in shorts, trainers, and a zippered sweatshirt over a tank top. The very instant she appeared, all of my cousins started hooting and hollering, to her obvious displeasure. I was shocked, not expecting my cousins to be such idiots, but that they were and I merely watched it happen speechlessly. I felt ashamed (and still do) to know that my own relatives behave in that manner, all the more so because judging from how casually they seemed to go at it, it was probably something they did often. Today, I still cringe every time at the prospect of having to go visit them, I even asked my dad to not visit granny at the same time so as them to avoid them. Thankfully, I haven't had to meet with them since, as my dad isn't that very fond of that branch of the family either.

I hate to know that things like that might well happen to lots of women on a regular basis. I also hate to know that I have to be associated with such people because they're part of my (extended) family, and even if they weren't, I'd still be lumped together with such them simply because we share the same physical features. I have several female friends, brilliant, awesome, vibrant people for whom I have a great deal of respect and simply hate the thought of such women regularly having to endure denigration and harassment by such shallow idiots, simply because of their sex. I know what it's like to be harassed, I have been so because of my heritage, and I wouldn't wish that upon anybody.

I'm not going generalize and say that we should block Middle-Easterners from immigrating hither, precisely because of the reason Prestian quoted Peeters as saying. My father left Iraq for Europe because he was tired of the conservatism of his home; had we barred Middle-Easterners from entering, then he'd still be stuck in that wartorn, racist, backward shithole, in which I'd also be forced to grow up, provided I'd even been born in the first place.

What a retarded term. Firstly, ethnocentrism covers the concept perfectly well, and secondly, to call ethnocentrism racism is ridiculous.

Or ban cars to avoid accidents. Not really, it's already forbidden to drink and drive and the police do crack down on drunk driving, which is a good thing.

You're free to drink as long as your drinking doesn't harm others and you're free to smoke as long as it doesn't harm others.

As I see it, the core of the problem is that there are a few trends which kind of go hand in hand: Urbanization, multiculturalism, and a lack of concern about the commons. Pundits tend to confuse the effects of one trend with those of another.

In our modern times, people have a tendency to retreat into the bubbles of their home and work lives. People here in the USA and over in the UK for example have stopped believing in the commons altogether many decades ago. People put together their own little British or ""American Dream"" - which means their own little suburban cocoon. The way public policy is discussed in these countries reflects this cocooning. How can one debate public policy with a Libertarian or a ""Tea Partier"" who basically wants to defund public policy altogether? Some California cities are facing a problem where they can't pay for anything besides a police force and police retirement pension obligations.

So I would argue that multiculturalism is NOT the problem. It's rather a lack of an appreciation for the importance of the commons. If people don't band together as a community to achieve certain outcomes for the town or district or city, whose fault is that, really? I think that Russian cities are a good example of places that are both very homogenous, ethnically, but also where people are focused on their personal lives to the detriment of a concern for the commons. This is quite ironic, considering the communist economic model which was in force through much of the 1900s.

So? Part of the communist ideology, at least as interpreted by Stalinism and Maosim alike, is the abolishing of all religion. Opiate of the people and all that. You might as well say: ""Having a centrally planned economy was just a means to an end; instilling communism was the ultimate objective.""

&gt; Because they followed the wrong religion and not the One True Religion aka Communism.

This raises the question of how you're supposed to define a religion in the first place. Communism has no beliefs in any supernatural or divine power. It believes in reason as interpreted from its own paradigm. The Soviet Union and China both spend a lot of resources on scientific advancement and education of the populace (look at how proud the Soviets were about their exploits in space, and how they forced people to adapt admittedly mistaken but nonetheless perceived to be scientifically based agricultural practices, for example). Sure, there is an element of leader worship and most certainly a very strong concept of religion-like dogma in regards to ideological thought. But is that enough to qualify it as a religion? Does that not make most if not all political ideologies or parties ""religions"" (even if their methods of enforcement are not always as violent as the communists were during the Cold War)? Surely if you were to join almost any mainstream European political party no matter what end of the spectrum and then start questioning their ideas you'd be kicked out at the spot for being in violation of party ""dogma""?

Sometimes communists blur the lines, but ultimately it's an ideology first and foremost. It is not a religion. Hell, there's nothing about communism except for its very strong opposition to organised religion that goes against anything that for example Christianity or Islam teaches. Rich men, heaven, camels, eye of needles, ring any bells? Are you aware that Islam prescribes mandatory charity, in concept not all that different from sharing the wealth? Did you know about [these](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_communism) [couple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Socialism) of [ideologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_socialism), all based on merging left-wing political thought with religious fundamentalism? How would that even work, if communism is its own religion (and thus implicitly non-compatibility with other religions)?

But in any case, why does it matter if they were atheist (or their regimes were, if not they themselves)? Atheism is *not* a religion. It makes no demands of its adherents to act or believe in any particular way or thing. Isn't that partly the point? I don't see why you couldn't be both a genocidal dictator and an atheist, when atheist *itself* (as opposed to secular humanism or just plain old cultural doxa) doesn't prohibit you from cold-hearted oppression and mass killings. Atheism is a grouping of a huge number of diverse beliefs and people, not all of them are pleasant. The only thing they have in common is that they do not follow any particular religion or hold beliefs about anything supernatural. This can't be news to you.

London used Wimbledon for tennis, Eton College's rowing lake for rowing, and pre-existing facilities for Slalom canoeing, sailing, and mountain-biking, whereas for all of these sports, Athens seems to have created new facilities for the Olympics.

Looking through all these buildings, many do seem to have been admirably repurposed, but my god, think of the poor bastard who was given the job of finding tenants for something like ten newly built 5-20,000 seater stadia, in a city with a population of three million.

Oh boy, I sure hope all those restaurants out there are selling only organic food and many veggies! Also let's burn down all fast-food restaurants because I'm sure they're pretty harmful to the health of society and since the state will end up footing the bill for bad health we gotta make sure people have a healthy diet!

&gt;True, but it's still not an excuse to deny the basic healthcare to those who can't afford it. I'm not saying you should guarantee top quality healthcare for everyone and everything, I'm just saying people's lives are worth more than their medical expense and nobody should be denied healthcare because of their financial situation.

&gt;Besides, if you save a life, it's one more person than can then work and pay taxes like the rest of us and also contribute and pay back for the system that saved its life, so if your issue is with the money spent on the NHS, those who benefit also pay back just like if you ever need it, it will be there for you.

But I think you're right, what people think of their own public broadcast has surely an influence on its freedom: I feel safe to say the relationship Italians have with RAI is nowhere as good as that between the British and BBC - case in point, the annual tax to 'watch RAI/own a 'device which *can* be used to watch television'^* is the most evaded in Italy. And that's saying something.

^* Yes: according to ~~Italian law~~a several decade old *royal decree*, those two things are the same thing. So you can't own a TV set to watch only private networks without paying that RAI tax. And they were this close to enforce this particular tax on smartphone owners, a couple of months ago.

Yeah, exaggerate all you want, cigarette smoke is very harmful, not only for you but for those around as well, and it's at any dose.

&gt;Je reste donc très sceptique sur vos capacités à accompagner un usager dans une utilisation sécurisée d'un ordinateur

Vous prétendez mieux vous y connaître que moi sur le sujet. Le mieux c'est que l'on puisse avoir un échange d'expérience.

Comment je procède :


J'installe les mises à jour le plus rapidement possible, utilise uniquement des logiciels libres reconnus, choisis des mots de passe forts type [xkcd](http://xkcd.com/936/) différents pour toutes mes identifications, puis les sauvegarde dans [KeepassX](http://www.keepassx.org/), j'utilise un mot de passe maître pour Firefox, sécurise mon wifi au maximum, utilise le moins possible les autres wifis, utilise presque exclusivement mon portable pour naviguer sur internet, ne laisse jamais une personne utiliser ma session (sauf ma copine), détruits physiquement mes anciens disques durs, j'essaye d'être le plus vigilant possible face au hameçonnage, privilègie l'https, n'achète que sur les sites ayant pignon sur rue.

Pour Windows : antivirus type Avast ou Windows Security essentials, Spybot...

J'ai bien conscience que tout cela ne suffit pas pour être complètement en sécurité, car un ordinateur sécurisé est un ordinateur éteint (et encore).

&gt;Most discussions about being German or not are about issues concerning this cultural background, for example the debate about wearing hijabs and building mosques.

But this discussion isn't about building mosques. If somebody says ""I am German"" or ""I am American"" or whatever, then I assume they mean their nationality unless specified otherwise. So you can say ""I am American, but I have a German background"" or even ""I am American, but German at heart"" or ""I am American, but used to be German"" or something, but using any other criteria than the passport leads to arbitrariness.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;They were collecting some information from british muslims lately. According to that 32 % of muslims think it might be okay to kill in the name of the religion, 40 % wants sharia law in Britain. 

I dont trust these surveys very much to be honest. Surveys can be easily manipulated to suit the paying customer. 

For the first ten years of this century, media driven islamophobia was at its peak. Every single day there would be dozens of anti-islamic news stories across the media, many of them completely untrue. That was nothing more than a concerterted propaganda campaign to justify wars in muslim countries. And almost overnight it stops. Media doesnt just report facts as news it also serves as a government 

&gt;So please dont give me that ""modern european muslim"" because theres plenty of them that are far from modern. And muslims these days feel like their faith is under attack + crisis so my theory is that it will get even worse. And if you dont its possible look what happend in Iran.

Sure there are plenty that are far from modern, but they are vastly outnumbered by those that live normal, ordinary lives and our society benefits from those people, they contribute greatly to society. However the media doesnt focus on these people they focus on the loudmouths and extremists. Yes there is a problem with radicalism in Europe. Just as there is a problem with separatism in Europe and the far right in Europe.

Lets be honest there faith has been under attack. The media has calmed down as the war in muslim countries is winding down. Funny that.

The idea that somehow we will all be forced to live under shariah law is so utterly ridiculous its laughable. It will never happen. Ever. 

&gt;What I am really afraid of is how muslims are bound to their religion. So what might happen in the future with rising muslim number is that their radical religious leaders might force even ""modern"" muslims into something radical through threats and such.

They have seen a million killed in their lands since 2001 I think they have more to fear than us. I can only speak from my experiences with the Egyptians I know, they hate the terrorists and what they have done in the name of islam.

&gt;Syria is our friend until another dictator takes the power. 

He will be our dictator.

&gt;I dont think Kosovo should have been ever created. Its a land basically stolen from Serbia by Albanians.
 
Completely agree. That is Serbian land.

true,RedZupp,null,null,"Selbstverständlich sind es politische und wirtschaftliche Kräfte, die im Hintergrund großer Konflikte die Fäden ziehen. Machen wir uns nichts vor, die Führer größerer Gruppen sind nur selten dorthin gekommen wo sie sind, wenn sie gleichzeitig Idioten sind. Hinter großen Konflikten stecken immer reale Gründe, das war durch alle Zeiten so. Selbst Al-Quaida war ursprünglich eigentlich ein Ausdruck der Rebellion der saudischen Burgeoisie gegenüber dem Königshaus (selbstverständlich mit religiösen Elementen vermischt). Auch der Konflikt zwischen Saudi-Arabien und dem Iran, den manche als Konflikt zwischen Sunniten und Schiiten sehen, hat knallharte Gründe. Den Konflikt zwischen Persern und Arabern gibt es schließlich länger als den Islam. Da geht es heutzutage ausschließlich um die Vorherrschaft am Golf. Ähnliche Parallelen kann man auch in Israel ziehen.

Allerdings kann Religion immer ein Antriebsfaktor für Einzelne sein. Das macht sie einerseits nützlich als Mittel zur Bindung einfacher Gläubiger(Religion als Opium), andererseits kann sie dazu führen, dass Einzelne, die von den großen Pfründen des Konfliktes nichts bekommen, durch besondere ""Frömmigkeit"" versuchen, hohes Ansehen vor ihrem Gott zu erreichen(Fanatiker, Märtyrer). Das sind dann diejenigen, die problematisch werden. Im mehr oder weniger ""aufgeklärten"" Deutschland spielt das kaum noch eine Rolle, weil Gott keine große Rolle mehr spielt. Dem Islam fehlt eine solche Aufklärung im Moment noch und so treten vermehrt einzelne Vertreter auf, die dieses Ansehen vor Gott erwerben wollen. Beängstigend ist, dass auch christliche Fanatiker (vornehmlich natürlich in den USA) wieder zurückrudern.
