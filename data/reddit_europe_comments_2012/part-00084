In the 13th century, Latvians and Lithuanians (Samogitians and Semigallians) were united in the fight against the Livonian Brothers of the Sword (Sword Brethren). 

The legend goes that a great Latvian hero was struck with a sword and carried out of the battle on a white piece of cloth. Blood poured from him, onto his sides and on the sides of the cloth. When the hero had passed on, the Latvians took their new flag into battle, and crushed the Livonian Brothers of the Sword. This battle in Latvian means 'Saules kauja' or Battle of the sun (Battle of Schaulen)

Es gibt ein Gewissen. Und gerade Unternehmerpersönlichkeiten sind in ihrer Überzeugung sehr selbstbestimmt. Sie nehmen ihr Schicksal selbst in die Hand und fühlen sich demnach auch verantwortlich für ihre Tun. Sie sonnen sich ja gerne in dem Erfolg, den sie mit ihren eigenen Händen erarbeitet haben. Und auch wenn ein Unternehmer ein Arsch ist, so wird er immer gewisse Grenzen kennen. Wohingegen der Befehlsempfänger in einem System (siehe Milgram-Experiment) viel eher unaussprechliche Grausamkeiten ausführt. Aber das ist eine Tendenz. Ein höherer Anteil an Menschen kommt gut damit klar böse Dinge zu tun, so lange er die Verantwortung innerlich von sich weisen kann. Ausnahmen bestätigen die Regel.

The idea that in the event of a Greek meltdown the only economic migrants would be those who already have connections is endearingly naive.  Presumably there's tradespeople in Greece?

Come to the UK with any of these and walk into a job.  It's not just the nurses and the teachers (who would also be welcome and walk into jobs). 

Personally I don't have a problem with employable Greeks coming to the UK even if they don't have a firm job offer.  I couldn't care if there's a brain drain in Greece they've done it to themselves and if I were Greek I'd be moving out too.  I'm only concerned that there's a transaction tax when moving a certain amount of money out of the UK.

What is a problem is if there is a specific economic event  which creates a surge or a peak.  I'm glad the Home Office are thinking up contingency plans and thinking through several scenarios.  That's what they're there to do.

&gt;Unskilled Greek workers (there are VERY FEW of them in the young population) do not have to come to the UK, they will go wherever there are jobs (definitely not the UK therefore)

Maybe you missed the point where the UK is the easiest place to set up a business, that the IMF has the UK showing growth in the last two quarters, growth for 2013 and again in 2014 - meanwhile the EU is set to contract.  That Greeks speak predominantly English and the strong currency would make sending money home more attractive.

If you chose to come to the UK when things were going quite well for Greece, I dare say others will want to come when things aren't going so well.

&gt;Cameron can't control shit.

I think you'll find the Prime Minister of the Great Britain can indeed do and control shit.  In fact the job of Prime Minister is so revered because it is indeed a position were shit can get done and controlled.  It's a shit controlling and doing job.  In the long list of shit doing jobs it's right up there with the best.  And since one of the powers in his arsenal is a law which allows him to control people coming into the country in times of economic crisis, it's safe to say Cameron can control shit.

The Home Office isn't looking at the trends and making these contingency plans for jollies.  It's straight forward commonsense.
        
             ""If the single currency broke up, people looking for 
              work abroad may see Britain as an attractive 
              alternative as it is a non-eurozone country.""

Well indeed. Who knows why? 

[*Poll shows Muslims in Britain are the most anti-western in Europe*](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/jun/23/uk.religion)

where we can also read that:

 * only 17% of British Muslims believe that Arabs carried out the September 11th attacks and
 * only 32% of Muslims in Britain had a favourable opinion of Jews

and from elsewhereL

 * 24% of British Muslims deny that the four British Muslim suicide bombers carried out the 7/7 attacks

 * 24% of British Muslims believe the British government carried out the 7/7 attacks.

and also:

 * 45 per cent think 9/11 was carried out by the US or Israel

And [from here](http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/291):

 * 33% of Muslims want Sharia Law as implemented in Saudi Arabia.

 * 28% of muslims agreed they dreamt of Britain becoming an Islamic State.
 
 * 78% wanted the Danish cartoonist prosecuted.

 * 62% disagree with the freedom of speech if it insults religious sensibilities.

 * 50% said British people who insult Islam should be arrested and prosecuted.

I have been living in paris for 10 year now (will be 10 on august 1st !). I'm 29, single, software engineer :

- I live in the 14th district, in front of the Santé Jail which is a nice area of Paris (pretty calm)
- Flat is 30 m², rent is 720 euros/month
- I drive a scooter : 60 euros/month insurance and 30 for fuel
- Internet costs me 40 euros/month
- Phone bill : 50 euros/month
- Food : 150 euros/month MINIMUM

- Medical stuff : pretty heavy for me, it's 200 euros but not everyone needs strong medical attention... It's all reimbursed by the social security and my work medical agreement, but still it's something I pay in advance.)

- Electricity bill : 20 euros/month
- Rent tax : 700 euros/year -&gt; 60 euros/month

total without medical : 1130 euros.

additionnal stuff to enjoy paris :

- going out in pubs  twice a week, monthly cost 300 euros/month because I like giving away free beers to my friends :)

- cinema say average 5 euros/month because I go every 3 months

- will add later if I can remember..


Hope that helps !

&gt; I am going into my 11th year and in my 4th level of French.

Sorry, no idea what this is. How old are you ? How many years before graduation from high school ?

&gt; Is there any colleges that have english speaking courses?

&gt; Or would it be better for me to do a gap year in France to get accustomed to the language before enrolling into a french speaking university?

If you can afford it, yes most likely. Other redditors may have experiences with this kind of situation.

&gt; Any advice and information regarding these questions will be a major help

Here is how superior education is structured in France : 
http://pedagogie.ac-toulouse.fr/lyc-tgautier-tarbes/spip/IMG/jpg/schemalmd.jpg

* Baccalauréat is the graduation at the end of high school.

* PCEM and PCEP are medicine-related field of studies

* Licence is pretty self explanatory. It can vary a bit depending on the university

* DEUST/DUT are usually more ""practical"" than Licence and can lead to jobs or higher studies. May be a good start if you don't want to do a shitload of maths/physics before doing computer science engineering for example.

* BTS is shorter and you can work right after it. It can go from hair dressing to computer tech stuff to management etc. In some cases you can do it ""in alternance"" which means you spend part of your time at the school, part of your time in a company

* Classes prépas are usually the hardest scientific stuff (along with medicine) and can be in maths/physics/chemistry/bio/geo/literature/economics and leads to different schools which are usually very well considered (écoles d'ingénieurs, écoles de commerces, ENS, HEC, etc). You can join these prestigious schools after DUT or university but it's a bit different. Some schools also last 5 years and you can join them right after graduation

Hope that gave you an overview. What field are you interested in ?
You may also have problems to join anything other than university in some fields because the American high school typically has a lower level than France's so watch out for this equivalence.",0,1341494359,null,0,false,0,c59patm,t3_w2osq,t1_c59patm,t3_w2osq,null,1429301124,4,false,france,t5_2qhjz,4

true,charlofsweden,SWED,Stockholm,"EDIT: As I was looking through this whole thing I realised that we might be arguing different points. It is relevant to know in the context of this that **Sweden does not have bail for any sort of crime or incarceration.** Once you are incarcerated you are incarcerated. You don't get to buy your way out of jail.

The thing is that from the point of view of the Swedish justice system when it comes to sexual crimes such as rape the rights of the victim always comes first.

Imagine you've been raped (though it's impossible to know the actual torment of that unless you've personally been a victim, but for argument's sake) or sexually abused. You know who did it, you've told the police, who've told the prosecutor who gets to investing the charges. The person who raped you is a foreigner known to travel a lot. Now imagine that the prosecutor then goes: ""Well, we know for a fact that he will be leaving the country because that's what he does, but we won't stop him. We are just going to let your rapist leave the country with no objection while we sort this thing out."" How would you feel about that? And then the investigation is never closed because the prosecutor needs to hear the alleged perpetrator, only he's out of the country and he's never coming back, so there can be hearing, and there can be no trial. Your rapist goes free. Do you really think that's fair?

Now, granted, the way sexual crimes are handled in Sweden leaves a lot to be wished for. The laws surrounding rape and sexual abuse were extensively reformed just a couple of years ago, in the early 00's, because of harsh critique from media and the public for how easy it was for rapists to go free of their crimes. In the process of reforming these laws some rather rash decisions were made with inadequate thoughts as to the consequences (for example it is now illegal for two 14 year olds to have *consensual* sex, and both participants could be charged with rape for it). The very fact that Assange would be charged for rape because of the alleged actions is a function of this reform. Now, whether what he did should be called rape or not is not something the justice system can or should be allowed to even have an opinion. The fact is that the law says explicitly that it is rape, and the justice system has to handle the case from that. Assange is wanted for questioning under a rather broad, ""umbrella""-type leglislation. Under the same legislation people who hide in parks and overpower young women to violently rape them are also charged, and if Assange had been wanted for that no one would be questioning whether he should be incarcerated or not. The justice system has to have the tools to treat anyone suspected of the same crime the same way, which is why they have to treat Assange this way out of principle. It's nothing personal, but that's the way the system works.

EDIT: Also, no one should be allowed bail. Bail is a silly and antiquated system that allows the rich to circumvent the law. Either you are incarcerated or you are not, you should not simply be allowed to pay your way out of it.",0,1341501006,null,0,1341519013,0,c59qiq8,t3_w1bex,t1_c59qiq8,t1_c59p1mk,null,1429301658,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

* Medicine, which can lead to pharmacy. There are contests though so it's highly challenging. I am not competent to give more informations about this but coming from America and without being bilingual I think it will be near impossible. I don't even think they have places for foreigners (engineering schools do offer possibilities for foreigners for example)

* Post-bac schools. Usually private schools (count at least 5k€ a year) and the quality may change. I don't know much about them either. A friend of mine was at sup biotech (biotechnology) but that's it. When looking into such schools (in the biostuff field or in the chemistry field) you should always check the ""fame"" of the school to check its seriousness. If it pretends it will give a ""diplôme d'ingénieur"", check for the CTI (comission du titre d'ingénieur) certification.

* University and DUT probably have some biology/biochemistry/chemistry departments but it's case-by-case I guess. It is highly unlikely that any of these establishments offer courses in English.

It sounds to me your best bet is to spend AT LEAST 1 year in France, being either working, au pair, studying French, giving English conversation classes, etc so as to get to know the country (and its paperwork) and the language.

naja ob es gut oder schlecht wäre ist die eine Frage. Kleinere Banken bringen wiederum andere Risiken mit sich. Wobei natürlich auch gesagt werden muss wie groß die ""vielen kleinen Banken"" dann jeweils sind (war das verständlich ausgedrückt?). Wenn die einzelnen Kreditinstitute zu klein sind kann es wesentlich schwieriger werden große Kredite zu bekommen. Ich meine damit nicht nur Spekulative Kredite, sondern generell auch gut begründete Investitionssummen, die einfach den Bereitschaftsrahmen einer solchen kleinen Bank sprengen würden. Zum anderen wäre ein Gewirr aus vielen kleinen Banken unter Umständen noch schwerer zu Kontrollieren als es jetzt schon der Fall ist und inwiefern diese dann jeweils verflochten sind ist noch eine andere Sache. Dann bleibt auch noch die Frage wie sich die Kreditinstitute verhalten werden wenn ihnen eine Aufspaltung unmittelbar bevorsteht. Ich will damit nur sagen, dass das alles irgendwie von der Größe vor und nach der Zerschlagung abhängt (haha es kommt auf die Größe an... ich weiß ich bin nicht witzig).

Zum anderen kann ich mir nicht ganz vorstellen wie das ganze rechtlich und praktisch zu bewerkstelligen sein soll. Rechtlich bzw. politisch ist ein solcher Eingriff in die Wirtschaft nur schwer umzusetzen und zu rechtfertigen. Auch muss man sich fragen wie eine solche Zerschlagung umzusetzen ist, ich kann mir das nicht vorstellen.

&gt;Wenn die einzelnen Kreditinstitute zu klein sind kann es wesentlich schwieriger werden große Kredite zu bekommen.

Wo ist da das Problem? Wenn ich wirklich riesige Summen brauche, dann muss ich eben mehr Banken finden, die bereit sind mir einen Kredit zu gewähren. Bei 100 Millionen Euro oder mehr sehe ich kein Problem darin 10 Leute zu beschäftigen, die versuchen 10 Banken zu finden, die gemeinsam diese Summe stemmen wollen. Bei noch größeren Summen wird das Problem noch geringer.

&gt;Zum anderen wäre ein Gewirr aus vielen kleinen Banken unter Umständen noch schwerer zu Kontrollieren als es jetzt schon der Fall ist und inwiefern diese dann jeweils verflochten sind ist noch eine andere Sache.

Das ist ein wichtiger Punkt und ich stimme dir zu, dass die zu große Verflechtung von Banken ein Problem darstellt. Ich bin kein Bankenexperte und kann deshalb keine Lösung präsentieren. Dieses Problem besteht aber im selben Maße bei großen Banken.

Das Hauptproblem liegt meines Erachtens darin, dass Banken zu lange brauchen um pleite zu gehen. Es gibt zu viele Möglichkeiten große Investitionsfehler einer Bank hinauszuschieben, bis sie sich zu einem so großen Haufen angesammelt haben, dass der Schaden den eine Pleite der Bank auslöst zu groß wird. 

Das stellt ein fundamentales Problem dar. Menschen sind Gewohnheitstiere. Wenn wir etwas neues tun, dann wiederholen wir das so lange, bis es sich als Fehler herausstellt, der so groß ist, dass wir etwas ändern müssen. (Ich hab da leider keine Studie oder so was zu, das wäre allerdings sehr interessant.)  
Darum denke ich, dass es wichtig ist Fehler früh in einer Weise zu bestrafen, die eine Wiederholung dieser Fehler verhindert. Die Pleite eines Unternehmens ist ein relativ drastisches Beispiel dafür. 

&gt;Zum anderen kann ich mir nicht ganz vorstellen wie das ganze rechtlich und praktisch zu bewerkstelligen sein soll. 

Nun dafür gibt es genügend Politiker und Banken in diesem Land, um dafür eine sinnvolle Lösung zu finden.

LOL much much worse. Almost beyond imagination.

The letter is in context with the introduction of the [ESM](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europ%C3%A4ischer_Stabilit%C3%A4tsmechanismus) where the participating states commit to common liability but without parliamentary checks. The money goes directly to the troubled banks. There's just a board that decides in a **simple majority** voting  to pass-through the taxpayers money. It's a fatal mistake to introduce something like this before a common fiscal and  budgetary policy is guaranteed. The very same mistake is repeated that has been made with the precipitated introduction of the Euro. And additionally the possibility to have any influence on the incrusted economic structures of the crisis states is taken away.

tl;dr the taxpayers now pay directly to maladministrated struggling  banks

&gt; Having spotted that an Arctic boom was about to end, a government-owned fund from Oslo must have thought it had found an easy way to make money in a market it knew well. It began to sell short the bonds of Iceland's over-stretched banks. Only common sense, you might argue.

&gt; Halldor Asgrimsson, then Iceland's prime minister, did not see things quite like that. Why was the Norwegian state investing hundreds of millions of dollars to undermine Iceland's economy? Had not both countries signed a Nordic mutual-defence pact against financial destabilisation? “We must protest against this action,” he told Morgunbladid, a newspaper.

The article only covers government owned wealth funds, which are indirectly pension funds for most nations. Private pension funds are almost as large and own I think more capital.

The consulate will give you a list of stuff it needs.  You will send that stuff with your application.  About two months later, you will call and ask if everything is going well.  They will tell you that you forgot to send your plane ticket information (which wasn't requested by them to begin with).  You will then tell them that you are uncomfortable purchasing $3000+ dollars worth of airline tickets without first knowing that you will be able to obtain a Visa.  They won't care.  So then you purchase airline tickets for a date three months in advance, hoping that they will complete the Visa in the three months.  One month before your plane takes off, you will call to ask if everything is going well.  They will tell you it will likely take another two or three months.

Yes, this does happen.  My wife and I worked with one consulate while my wife's coworker worked with another Italian consulate on the other side of the country.  We both had the exact same issue.  It wasn't a fluke.

It isn't.

Like I said, for something to be incitement it has to be considered or be reasonably assumed to be a call to action against a group of people.

That's how it works in Sweden anyway.

true,Superjuden,null,null,"The problem is that of taking pride in something you, personally, have had little to do with. 

Take WW2 as an example. Plenty of middle-aged and older men grew up during the immediate post-war period and their only experience with the war is from fictional retelling and history class. As a result they were fed an extremely heroic, naive and quite frankly absurd idea of what happened. Sure they might know that things weren't awesome but that's the impression they got during childhood and it's this kind of nostalgic emotion they experience when they think about the war. They take pride in the fact that others fought and died in this war, I would suspect because of some strange notion that it was their superior values of their culture which made them win the war and perhaps because people think that being part of a culture which have done supposedly heroic deeds is also a culture of heroes. The thing is that after a war is over, people usually don't like to just sit around and talk about how shit it really was and  think about how much evil shit that was done to win the war.

We like talking about our boys and their heroic deed and rarely ever like talking about all the people who shit their pants and cry for mommy every time they heard a loud bang for the rest of their lives because of what they went through.  

Sure we talk about stuff like the holocaust and what not because that's what the enemy did. We really don't like to dwell on the fact if we had lost, we might have been put on similar trails to that which the nazi were put through in Nuremburg. I mean, plenty of Americans will, with a straight face, tell you that things like the firebombing and nuking of Japanese civilian targets had to be done in order for America to win the war, because the lives of Japanese civilians obviously weren't as important as the lives of American soldiers. I mean the nukes are only talked about because it was the first and only time in history anyone had ever used something like this, the fire bombing however was several times more devastating and was and is largely ignored.

Questioning the means which brought victory in war is not something a patriot does. You're supposed to be proud of the victory and feel good about the culture which gave it to you. 

It's these side of patriotism, the sides that tells you to take pride in things you haven't done, to paint a picture of things as being better than they actually were or are and which encourages people to treat those who do not take pride in everything the country has done as traitors, which bothers people. America and other countries in the post-WW2 era has been fed this kind of patriotism ever since WW2 ended. 

Not every country has to have this kind of patriotism of course but even if that's not the case, the point is still that you haven't done anything and taking pride in something you haven't done or is simply a part of is rather silly.

[Richard Koo’s semi-successful attempt to persuade Germans about balance sheet recession](http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2012/07/04/1070831/richard-koos-semi-successful-attempt-to-persuade-some-germans-about-balance-sheet-recession/)
&gt;At this point, Koo writes, he was running short of time to elaborate with these non-economically-trained folk on exactly why the balance sheet/deflation problem was just as important, but somewhat more urgent, than the structural reforms.

So he resorted to a medical metaphor, with a patient suffering both pneumonia and diabetes — both need treating, but the former needs treating right now.


[German Bubbles](http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2012/06/21/1053921/koo-on-german-bubbles/)
&gt;The countries of southern Europe, which had not participated in the IT bubble, enjoyed strong economies and robust private sector demand for funds at the time. The ECB’s 2% policy rate therefore led to sharp growth in the money supply, which in turn fueled economic expansions and housing bubbles.

In short, the ECB’s ultra-low policy rate had little impact in Germany, which was suffering from a balance sheet recession, but it was too low for other countries in the eurozone, resulting in widely divergent rates of inflation.",0,1341519119,null,0,false,0,c59uz45,t3_w3c5e,t1_c59uz45,t3_w3c5e,null,1429303854,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

The recent satire is a good example.  Sure its presented half jokingly, but people love it not because its a good joke, but because they want to be proud of their area and want it to become more successful and powerful. Its human nature.  People just still feel funny about it because it has long been held up that their lack of patriotism is what makes them superior so it will feel funny for a while.  I think the benefits of a patriotic, unified European state will supersede the benefits that being proud of being unpatriotic in the long term.

Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge,
Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs,

Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots,
But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame, all blind;
Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots
Of gas-shells dropping softly behind.

Gas! GAS! Quick, boys! — An ecstasy of fumbling
Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time,
But someone still was yelling out and stumbling
And flound'ring like a man in fire or lime.—
Dim through the misty panes and thick green light,
As under a green sea, I saw him drowning.
In all my dreams before my helpless sight
He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.

If in some smothering dreams, you too could pace
Behind the wagon that we flung him in,
And watch the white eyes writhing in his face,
His hanging face, like a devil's sick of sin,
If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood
Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs
Bitter as the cud
Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues, —
My friend, you would not tell with such high zest
To children ardent for some desperate glory,
The old Lie: Dulce et decorum est
Pro patria mori.

You can drive to Pompeii as well.  I suggest buying a tour or having a guidebook map there as the Pompeii ruins are very large.

Having the [Euro/Dollar rate](http://bit.ly/MNBm0P) being in 1.3 was killing exports for these firms. Many firms made reorganizations, like Wärtsilä which shutdown their factory in Turku and moved production to Trieste. While things were challenging in 04 and 05, things balanced out and exports rebounded.

Now in the same time EU removed quota restrictions on textiles and clothing. This was because of earlier agreement made in the WTO. In 2005 textile and cloth imports from China grew over 40% because of removal of trade restrictions. This more or less killed most textile and clothing manufacturers in southern Europe that hadn't prepared to Chinese importers.

true,[deleted],null,null,"But the point is that progress is something made towards a clear goal. However there seems to be no clear goal in history. A lot of left-leaning people assume history has a goal towards more and more equality, liberty and fraternity, but it is not at all sure, we can say Europe was more barbarous in 1930 than in 1880. 

Or for example everybody assumed in 1960 history is moving towards more and more social democracy but actually around 1975 it was often rolled back. You can call it reactionary change, but only if you assume history has the inherent goal of more and more social democracy, and hence progress is getting closer to it and regress is gettin back from it.

So the problem with the term progressive is the assumption that there is some generally agreed or historically hardcoded goal to progress to.

Now for example if you take this whole copyright thing, you can see that it is generally a modern invention, a hundred or two years old. In Gutenberg's time everybody just printed anything they wanted to, this is how Luther's theses spread so fast, printers just printed it without having to ask permission from the author.

So actually getting rid of copyright you could see also as reactionary, going back to Gutenberg's age.

I think your mistake is that is you assume modernity to be somehow special and thus repeating stuff that happened before modernity does not count as reactionary change or going back. I think this is wrong, there is no magic number in history, that 2012 can be compared to 1960 but somehow not with 1560.

I don't understand what you find immature in my comment. I am simply arguing that history has no inherent goal, especially not the inherent goal of always marching somehow ""left"", hence progress and regress are meaningless because they make sense only from the viewpoint of some inherent goal.

It's not a personal feeling, it is based on a fact: it is a fact that the very term of progress means getting closer to a goal. To talk about progress as a fact, one must assume there are certain goals either hardcoded in history or having a very general agreement. Usually a lot of people assume this inherent goal is ""moving left"", i.e. more liberty, more fraternity and more equality. But it is very debatable whether this assumption of inherent goal is true or not. Also please google the term ""immanentizing the eschathon"".

Similarly, the essence of socialism and communism was that history has a inherent goal, and its inherent goal is, suprise, suprise, socialism, so socialists are progressives. But if one does not accept that such inherent goal exists, then progress and regress makes no sense.",0,1341562768,null,0,false,0,c5a48os,t3_w1gr5,t1_c5a48os,t1_c59wg67,null,1429308903,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Finland would consider leaving the euro zone rather than paying the debts of other countries in the currency bloc, Finnish Finance Minister Jutta Urpilainen said in a newspaper interview Friday.

""Finland is committed to being a member of the euro zone, and we think that the euro is useful for Finland,"" Urpilainen told financial daily Kauppalehti, adding though that ""Finland will not hang itself to the euro at any cost and we are prepared for all scenarios.""

The finance minister stressed that Finland, one of only a few European Union countries to still enjoy a triple-A credit rating, would not agree to an integration model in which countries were collectively responsible for member states' debts and risks.

She also insisted that a proposed banking union would not work if it were based on joint liability.

""Collective responsibility for other countries' debt, economics and risks; this is not what we should be prepared for,"" Urpilainen said.

Urpilainen acknowledged in an interview with the Helsingin Sanomat daily that Finland ""represents a tough line"" when it comes to the euro-zone bailouts.

""We are constructive and want to solve the crisis, but not on any terms,"" she said.

As part of its tough stance, Finland has said that it will begin negotiations with Spain next week in order to obtain collateral in exchange for taking part in a bailout for ailing Spanish banks.

Finland has also voiced concern about an agreement reached at an EU summit in Brussels last week to use the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) to buy bonds to ease the unbearable borrowing costs which are squeezing Spain and other vulnerable euro-zone economies.

Last year Finland created a significant stumbling block for the euro-zone's second rescue package for Greece, agreeing to take part only after striking a collateral deal with Athens in October 2011.

Reality is, the followers of the big schools of economy might be wrong, but at least they're attempting to justify their beliefs.

Corruption, crony-capitalism and a lousy justice system can only be improved by changing to a system that punishes those things.

This can in a worst possible event also risk liquidity of the Finnish state, forcing the state either to default or run emergency austerity measures like what we have seen in the Baltics.

If we go back to what Mrs. Urpilainen said, she said that it is better to leave Euro than end up paying up the debts of other countries. To me that sounds about right. Those who use the money also have to carry their risks. If risks and their consequences want to be pooled together with other countries, then there also needs to be pooling of decision making and execution power.",0,1341576912,null,0,false,0,c5a5kum,t3_w4hz5,t1_c5a5kum,t1_c5a5hmw,null,1429309292,14,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,14

No, they are not. Of course they are known for making *irrational* decisions. That's the whole *point* of anger. Some very learned people posit that this is why anger evolved as a feeling: it serves as a sort of MAD device, a guarantee that *even though it would be irrational for me to fight you back, I will do so with all my strength, without calculating the consequences*. My anger guarantees that to you. This serves to make offenders think twice before offending, even when they know that they are stronger.

It impresses me how easily you discount the fact that criminals must pay, in the name of some sort of perceived 'stability'. You seem to think that there are no criminals, only 'scapegoats'.

Certain social groups are already not represented in a(our) democracy. Those under 18 are not. Prisoners are stripped of their voting rights. And you don't really see mental patients lining up outside of public schools on election day. There are social groups that are excluded, it's just a question of who and why.

There is a difference between asking ""should they vote?"" and stating ""they should not vote"". I never claimed that i have more rights then everybody else or people who just happen to be in a different age group. Your words, not mine.

I gave an example of why one might make that question or be in a dilemma about elderly people voting. Let me give you another one, because i believe there are moral/ethical issues attached. Let's say we - the greeks of 2012 - decide, that since we are in a crisis, to go the to chinese and tell them: ""Give us now 30bn euros and in 2050 we will repay you 300bn euros"". How is that fair to the greeks of 2050? People who are not even born yet will have to deal with the consequences of our actions. Is it morally/ethically acceptable for us to do such a thing?

Also you have to admit that at some level those elections where sort of an unofficial referendum on the EU and the EZ and our part regarding those 2 institutions. You really mean to tell me that some random pensioner from Grevena or Komotini or Levadia had any idea about what those 2 institutions really are? How they benefit or harm us? All they know about the subject is what they see on the TV news after the ""mesimerianadika"" and before the turkish drama serials. And all they heard through the campaign was that ""illegal immigrants are coming to get you"" and ""the left is after your savings and pensions"".

You have to admit that situations like that do raise some questions.

And you cannot possibly have any idea about what my idea of democracy is reading only a few sentences. Much less to label it as dangerously skewed.

true,Ozires,FINL,Finland,"The worst possible scenario for the Finnish state and all other European states is one several of the bigger European states such as Spain or Italy defaulting on their debts. Without the bailouts this would most definitely happen and cripple the whole European economy. Finland's economy still depends heavily on exports which make up nearly 37% of our BKT. And over half of our foreign trade is inside the European Union. There are many roads which lead to the Finnish state having to adopt austerity measures. Unfortunately, this seems to be often forgotten in our public discussion on the subject. And I would hate to see politicians pander to constituents without explaining what their decisions really hinge on.

""If risks and their consequences want to be pooled together with other countries, then there also needs to be pooling of decision making and execution power."" This exactly. Stronger European control on the finances and policies of the Eurozone, and to every possible extent of all the 27 countries, is definitely something we should not shy away from. Finland with its already tight budget legislation will not be forced into any unnecessary cuts in our spending. It's in Finland’s best interest to institute similar controls all over Europe so we won't have to face another meltdown 30 years from now. We can't allow poor governance in some European states to continually cause disruptions in the economy, not if we can fix it right now. As time passes, our markets are only going to get more interdependent, not less. The lack of cultural integration causes the EU only to act only with last ditch measures, but now that we're here every option needs to be considered, not only what will bring relief in the immediate future. If the Eurobonds, given their negative consequences, end up being the only way to save the Eurozone, we need to seriously weigh all their possible benefits against our qualms about Finland having to pay for the mismanagement of economies that weren’t so closely linked to ours in the past. 

In two extremes, we can either come out of this crisis fragmented and weakened or strengthened and united. Hopefully, some sort of middle road is achieved. Transferring political power needs to come with adopting more democratic measures in choosing the leadership of the EU institutions, hopefully this would come with a heightened coverage of European matters in all countries and correspond to a heightened interest in European elections. A way to go would be democratically choosing the leadership of the Commission perhaps with a two tier system allowing more involvement from the smaller, less populated countries.

Poor people, who have nothing else to lose and never did gain much from anything anyway, voted for 'populist' Syriza, as a means of punishing the old ruling dynasties and a hope for change. Think the recent USA elections and Obama ('Yes we can').

&gt; The periphery could have gained massively, however, by taking the concept of a balance-sheet recession to heart itself. After all, the opposite of a balance-sheet recession is (obviously) a credit-fueled asset boom. And if a balance-sheet recession requires the government to step in with fiscal stimulus, the opposite naturally requires the government to step in to contain an overheating economy—especially in a monetary union!

I take that a step further as a taxpayer. In Quebec, we completely fucked ourselves with our provincial pension scheme and our debt is cripplingly enormous. No one asked us to do any of this, but we're on the hook.

Here's the next step: should other Canadian provinces pay for *our* foolishness? They don't vote for our politicians. They have no say in our policy. 

If a nation is completely unaccountable to it's creditors, how is that right or fair? I liken it to the public money that's used for corporate welfare in building NFL stadiums in the USA. The taxpayer buys some billion-dollar stadium for an NFL owner, but the team gets most (or all) of the revenue and can move at any time. They can fire beloved players and coaches. They can put a shitty team on the field. We pay for it, but we have no say.

A vote is more than a ballot. You should vote with your money. If you asked me for a business loan or an investment, I would have say in your company and you'd need to meet my requirements. I'd want guarantees, I'd want to see your business plan, I'd want to be a silent or maybe even an active partner. It's a loan with conditions, not a grant.

It seems to me Europe stands to gain also from having France and Germany share differing views so other ideas than just the austerity plan can get a strong voice behind them. 

And I'm definitely not going to make the argument that Finland's IT boom didn't largely benefit from favourable circumstances in Europe, you're right that this is rarely recognized here. We just worked real hard and suddenly it happened.

Also seems to me that even with all the problems in the US with their constitutional division of power, the European institutions could stand to imitate them more. A system where we elect separate politicians to the EU and to our local government would do a lot to make the EU less confusing to people. It never fails to amaze me how complicated it is even after we're taught it in a multitude of situations. I think having our ministers running in and out from the EU just makes people wonder why they're not 'in parliament where they're supposed to be'. And if we had 2 senators from each country with actual powers, these posts would attract a lot more experienced politicians than what EU-posts have to date. 

The real problem lies with having EU-wide direct elections. If we elected some sort of president, where all Europe would get to pick from candidates (put forth by the EP?), then it'd add a lot of legitimacy to the whole project. Not to speak of how personal elections always bring out more interest than parliamentary ones. It would be an all-European spectacle. Like Eurovision, but less flashy.

I support the most recent agreement, because I believe a banking union is necessary and because I at least see movement towards a fiscal and eventually a political union, but I don't exactly find it ideal, I just don't see a realistic alternative. This process of integration is immensely difficult, legally and politically, and sharing the risk was supposed to be the reward that would have kept those negotiations on track.  
It's essentially the same mistake that was made during the introduction of the euro. You can't have a common currency without a common fiscal policy, internal transfers and the political union necessary to legitimize the decisions democratically, and neither can you permanently have a banking union without those other parts in place. But once the common currency had been introduced, everybody already had what they wanted and those difficult and politically unpopular steps that should have been a precondition were put off from one generation of national governments to the next. Hopefully this time it's different.

This agreement reduces the probability of a crisis by interrupting the feedback loop between a sovereign debt crisis and a banking crisis where a troubled banking sector would require a bailout from the government of an individual country, and it reduces contagion from one sovereign to the next, which partly relies on that same feedback loop via the interconnected banks. But it does this by spreading the cost without a limit to the amount, automatically without giving everybody who will eventually end up paying for it a say over the political decisions that could cause it everywhere, both in their respective public and private sectors. Normally, that your own banks are the first to go is a mechanism that helps against governments simply defaulting on their debt, but this agreement will effectively remove this deterrent.  
If legal or political problems cause the integration process to stall, then we will remain in a state where we will have shared consequences for individual decisions.

The ""ideals"" of the Eu thusfar has been highly selfish e.g. CAP and the moving parliament facilitated by a benign economy. We are now seeing the Eu under crisis and if I'm honest it's not exactly covering itself in glory.

Morally Merkel is on the highest ground possible but crude reality is dragging her (and Germany and others) down to the lowest common denominator which highlights the problems we have. Several countries ""gold plate"" EU legislation and enforce the rules, other are more lax and leave things open for interpretation. Too often this is also handled with ""national sensitivity"" in mind (e.g. Danone being a strategic company).

I'd love to be more pro-European as I do think the US is going in the wrong direction but the current implementation of the EU is frankly terrible.

Speaking of fire, your fire insurance is backed by bonds that you propose we default on, and I believe so is the reinsurance that insures that insurance, to a large part, although I may be wrong here. Due to their normally high security, those bonds are also a favorite for retirement accounts, and a whole lot of waitresses depend on pensioners being able to afford their coffee.  
Banks lend money to businesses so they can invest, buy machines from other businesses and hire people to work those machines. If the banks go, so does the rest of the economy, the building would have burned down to the ground. That money wouldn't just vanish from the books without any further consequences.

Where would that new timber come from? Economic structures take a long time to grow. There are many tiny pieces to an economy and they all rely on the ones they connect with to already be in place. This would take generations, building a house with a couple of seeds and a pile of ashes to fertilize the ground with comes pretty close. You can't just remove an amount that is comparable to the size of the combined annual economic output of the Eurozone from the books and don't expect there to be any consequences for anybody but the stereotypical speculators who probably have long parked their money elsewhere.

This doesn't mean we shouldn't address problems that exist in banking, I'm all for it. But while you can argue about whether it was all that smart to lend those economies so much money at such low rates, you can't call it speculation of the same kind of high-risk, high-gain speculation that had caused the previous crisis. This problem does exists, and again, we should do something about it, but we should try to do it without letting the house burn down.  

Also, if you have any suggestions about what kind of speculation should be outlawed and how, I'd like to hear them, because those instruments tend to have legitimate and useful applications as well, and I'm not sure where and how to draw the line.

From here it looks as if you just leave playing the bad guys to us. You're more than welcome to join the fun. It's not as if you actually had zero say in the negotiations, you even have a veto.

&gt;  On Germany's agenda, we find the extensive exposure of its own banking system to Southern troubles and aspirations toward leadership of Europe, which are considerations that are irrelevant for Finland, Holland and Austria.

A big part of Germany's agenda is a federal Europe, which should solve the issue of democratic legitimization. Currently we don't have that, so instead of one democratically legitimized European government to work on a solution, we have this present situation where individual nation states negotiate to find a compromise that they can all sell to their individual constituencies.  
This federal system would almost certainly have two chambers, and the lower chamber would be the European Parliament which uses a system of [degressive proportionality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apportionment_in_the_European_Parliament). So, Germany's influence would shrink compared to what it is now.

That part:

&gt;  the extensive exposure of its own banking system to Southern troubles

is another opportunity to recycle and extend part of an older comment:

Here's how much banks of various Eurozone countries lent to the GIIPS, pre-crisis figures are from the end of 2009, in millions US dollars, according to the BIS. You can find those figures in [this PDF](http://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qa1006.pdf), table 9B. You can find the latest figures [here](http://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qa1206.pdf), the file names follow a [YYQQ] convention. Pretty visualizations can be found [here](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/05/02/weekinreview/02marsh.html) and [here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-15748696). Note that I've swapped rows and columns for space reasons.  I've added a column with those countries' GDP, also in millions US dollars. The exchange rates have changed between those two figures, but this is just about rough proportions so it doesn't matter.

AFAIK, Finland was the only country which didn't default fully or partly their reparation payments)

EU has been good for us and really opened up the global markets after the bilateral trade with Soviets went to a halt. Nevertheless, as a nation, Finland has always been a net-payer in the Union (apart from 2000, which was due to late EU-payments for the previous year).

I don't think Finland will be the one cultivating the ""payer backlash"". The next political pressure will be with the European parlamentary elections at 2014, so the current regime has plenty of time to go with the selected course. The collapse won't happen before Germany stops paying and by then, they will be in so much trouble themselves that even they can't stop a massive EU-wide inflation cutting off the international debts.

But the real issue is with countries even poorer than Greece et al. Countries like Estonia, Slovakia and a number of Eastern European countries have been pushed to be the payers due to their willingness to adopt Euro and integrate to the EU. Their regimes won't hold no moral excuses to pay for people better off than themselves (GDP of Estonia is around 20% less than Greece, in 2011). I don't know about eurowide election calendar, but I'm very positive we'll be seeing some populistic triumphs ending up with distancing from the bailouts and EU. Depending on how the first ""exiters"" will fare, we'll likely see either stronger commitment to Euro (even from outside the eurozone) or encouragement for other members to abandon the sinking ship.

The mentality in Finland seems to be much of ""We know we'll be worse off if Eurozone fails, but we can take it. We always have.""

true,Eeko,FINL,Finland,"&gt; Why would you be worse off?

The thinking so far has been, that we have had a small chance of ""buying ourselves out"" from this mess with the packages and loans. Chances for that succeeding are becoming slimmer and slimmer every day, as we have been unable to seize the spread of the crisis. The issue we are trying to avoid is triggering the collapse of Eurozone and EU. Crashing the market would be disastrous for every economy on earth. More so for the euro-members, as the market-trust would be eradicated.

So if we'd leave, it would very likely trigger a chain reaction with an overall reduction in Eurozone credit ratings, possible followers with Austria, Netherlands, Estonia, Slovakia and who knows. It would break the Eurozone and we are trying to guess whether it's smarter to throw money at the problem or let the thing collapse. Since the collapse starts to seem imminent (maybe not by us, but some of the younger members have way more incentives), we think whether there might be some kind of first mover advantage.

Of course, if we'd never joined the EZ, we would likely be better off right now. Though the reasons to join (we had just survived a banking crisis of our own) would still be there and small currencies hold their own issues on the long run. I'd still prefer a joint currency, though it should be backed with joint economic policy and more homogenous governance.

EDIT: And let's not forget why the EU was initially forged. Peace is more fragile than we like to think about. It pains me greatly to think about, but honestly I can't see a future where won't see tanks in the streets of Athens, Rome or Madrid in the near future. So far no-one in the Eurozone has not played by the rules.

true,Eeko,FINL,Finland,"&gt; You are giving money to the banks without any colleteral - why?

As I understood it...

Banks are private companies like any others. They are owned by stockholders. Often the very same countries they are getting their bailouts from. The assets banks own are a collateral for their shareholders.

You could organize a ""support buying of stocks"" in order to receive a proper share for your investment. However, the stock market rate for troubled banks rarely is that solid for effective issues of shares. Nor do the banks even hold enough shares of themselves to give for the governments. E.g. in Nordea, the bank itself has control over only a few percents of the company stock. 

You could enact a forceful buyout of stock for a fixed price, but that is called nationalization and the markets might very easily draw conclusions of whether it's smart to invest somewhere, where governments have a habit of re-arranging ownership when their investments go up and down...

So we are kind of left with what the bailouts are doing right now. The governments themselves lending big sums of money via various instruments, hoping that the banks are able to pay them back.",0,1341614723,null,0,false,0,c5ae8vf,t3_w4hz5,t1_c5ae8vf,t1_c5adzid,null,1429313355,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

That's difficult to say. There's direct exposure, indirect exposure that depends on how the other banks and countries those banks have lent to would be holding up, and on how markets would behave when it would happen. I've used GDP because it works as a rough proxy to be able to compare the proportions. If Dutch banks can take a hit the size of a seventh of their country's GDP, good for them.

&gt;  This number is negligible for Holland, Austria and Finland yet substantial for Germany.

If you have those numbers then I'd be interested.

true,Eeko,FINL,Finland,"I agree with you. But I don't think that kind of nationalization is a realistic option in this scenario. First of all, no government holds control over the currency. In the 90's, government could promise to back up the deposits and loans as they could inflate the currency they were in if needed. Not even Germany or France can currently dictate the purchasing power of Euro in order to squeeze their way out of their banks debts.

Secondly, the powers seeking collateral are foreign nations from the other side of the continent. The political, social and economical unrest once large quantities of national property enters foreign hands can be an unknown. In Sweden, the banks fell to their domestic government.

Thirdly, the nations with troubled banks don't seem to want to do it. Our banks seem to be fairly isolated from the troubled countries, so we have no incentive to bail out our own banks even if we could. Germany, France, Spain, Italy... They would need to blow the whistle. And I can see they have more incentive to distribute their risks as much to the EZ as they can. (It's not fair and that should naturally be another reason to think leaving the EZ. I don't think this should be solely about the numbers any more. We need to bring values, honesty and justice to the table.)

&gt; Right now, you are just handing over money, without getting anything in return.

That is not technically true. Some emergency bailouts has been issued, but most of the large sums (including the EFSF) are about providing collateral for the loans of the troubled countries. So if we'll figure out a miracle in the next few months, curing the 25% unemployment in Spain, restore competitiveness in Greece, kill corruption from Italy... We wouldn't need to worry about the sums promised.

&gt; What are you going to do if Italy needs money? You are alredy in it, and they might need a lot.

I understood the prime mechanism to avoid misuse (of EFSF) is with the balance of terror involved. A nation asking for support loses the voting rights within the structure and so it becomes an issue for Germany and France to agree whether Italy should receive a bailout or not. They have their own larger proportions to pay, so there's some trust needed.

It's not a perfect nor a very good mechanism, but honestly, I can't think of much better ways to create such distribution channels once they have been decided to be necessary.
