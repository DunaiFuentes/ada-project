&gt;To state the obvious, Stevens was killed not by ""Libya"" but by a handful of people in a crowd of several hundred. It's unclear whether, as administration officials have reportedly begun to conclude, the violence was premeditated, or whether it was an opportunistic response to the gathering of an angry crowd, but a consensus has begun to form that the attack was carried out by Ansar al-Sharia, a militant group.

&gt;So what does ""Libya"" think? As my colleague Marc Lynch has noted, both Libya's leaders and Libyans taking to social media have condemned the attack unequivocally, and have spoken of their high regard for Stevens. Willliam Lawrence, North Africa director for the International Crisis Group, who is now in Tripoli, says that even Salafist groups have vocally condemned the killing, and Ansar al-Sharia has distanced itself from the rogue elements said to have carried out the violence, inviting Libya's militias to hunt them down and bring them to justice.",0,1347567943,null,0,false,0,c67r5e7,t3_zu010,t1_c67r5e7,t1_c67r1nm,null,1429891674,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,JB_UK,null,null,"&gt; Religions inspire people to commit violent and illogical acts. In Burma (Myanmar) right now, Buddhists are tying to ethnically cleanse Muslims with the blessings of the state government. But meanwhile there are certain Muslims wishing for non-Muslims to crawl into a hole and die. Of course, most Buddhists, Muslims, Christians etc are not filled with hate. But religious believers will always have illogical beliefs, and thats ok, as long as it doesnt cause harm to others. There is no need to hate on every person who believes that the Qu'ran is the direct word of god.

I quite like this bit by Orwell, who talks about 'Nationalisms' which may arise from nation, church, tribe, race, class, and so on:

&gt; As the nearest existing equivalent I have chosen the word ‘nationalism’, but it will be seen in a moment that I am not using it in quite the ordinary sense, if only because the emotion I am speaking about does not always attach itself to what is called a nation — that is, a single race or a geographical area. It can attach itself to a church or a class, or it may work in a merely negative sense, against something or other and without the need for any positive object of loyalty.

&gt; By ‘nationalism’ I mean first of all the habit of assuming that human beings can be classified like insects and that whole blocks of millions or tens of millions of people can be confidently labelled ‘good’ or ‘bad’(1). But secondly — and this is much more important — I mean the habit of identifying oneself with a single nation or other unit, placing it beyond good and evil and recognising no other duty than that of advancing its interests. 

I'm not a fan of the New Atheism argument about religion as, what I think Dawkins called, the 'root of all evil', or as a unique source of illogicality. I think it ignores the fundamental illogicality at the heart of human social behaviour. Why do you behave as you do, rather than like me, or like an educated person in China, or Pakistan, or like an educated person born 200 years ago in Britain, or indeed like a randomly selected friend of yours? There's clearly logic at play, but it's operating within a seething mass of circumstances. Were you poor, were you badly treated when you were brought up, is your culture rising or falling in power, what opportunities were offered you, was your mum kind, what's the prevailing social attitude towards race, what's your families take on it, did you meet someone who presented a particular argument to you with passion or eloquence, and on and on.

Il est aberrant et fatiguant cette notion que ce n'est pas du vol de s'en servir gratuitement de quelque chose dont on devrait payer.

L'argument est, alors, qu'il n'y a rien de concret volé quand on télécharge et donc ce n'est pas du vol, non ?

true,TheActualAWdeV,FRIE,Fryslân/Bilkert,"I just looked up the 50plus party. 

They're a bit more complicated than I thought they were, they want flexible retirement ages (no automatic redundancy when retirement age is reached either) they do seem to have some sensible points, seems I dismissed them too soon as a party for selfish babyboomers trying to hog all the wealth. My bad there I guess.

&gt;So what party usually wins?
 Amusingly enough, the CDA had been very big for a very long time and they seem to be at a record low now. In 2003 they had 44 seats, in 2006 41 and in 2010 only 21 and now they're down to thirteen. 

PvdA has IIRC been pretty big as well (especially here up north) but they've reached a record high this time around. 
I really don't know a whole lot about the recent histories of the political parties but I think the VVD has, in the last decade, mainly become popular with the populist spin-off parties. Starting with Fortuyn, then on to Verdonk for a short time, with now Wilders (who already has spin-offs from his own party). They tend to appeal to anti-islam sentiments but I think that now because of the crisis the anti-islam idea is less important than the economy and the newly found anti-europe from the PVV doesn't nearly appeal as much anymore. The VVD is the biggest party at the moment and apparently their economic liberal policies as well as the ""fuck the foreign poor"" idea appeals to people.

I'm not remotely offended by the marijuana legislation. It's a completely valid point. Japanese tourists show up here for the museums, the tulips, the windmills and Madurodam and what have you, but the US and, say, Italians come over here for pot. Sure, culture too but Italy has that in spades already. IIRC there even was a rush when the plans to make it more difficult to obtain for foreigners were announced.

This is actually one of the few points where I'm anti-EU in. They feel uneasy with legal marijuana but to me it's the only sensible option. It allows greater revenues for the state, it's safer for businesses and better for the consumer too. For some reason the VVD is against it. So are the confessional parties but Dutch protestantism tends to be of the ""no fun allowed"" type of religion so I can atleast understand their position.

I admit I haven't really looked into *why* they hold this position though. 

&gt;I'm not too sure we have such individualised parties,

The parties here usually aren't one-issue parties though. They tend to bring in ideas and policies on all sorts of issues (because they'll also be asked them! Even the party for the animals had to have an idea for the issue of home mortgage interest reduction because apparently that's important). So they all bring in a lot of stuff but from a particular point of view. 50+ wants to avoid making seniors suffer or pushed to the sidelines, PvdA wants to keep a solid social framework, Animal Party has leftist ideas on all sorts of issues with an extra sauce of animal protection and the PVV just yells loudly, which didn't get them anywhere this time. 

I think it's more to do with how the elections are set-up. Here, it is expected that you'll need to co-operate with others, but the UK has a first past the post system, right? There is the difference I think.

Really shiver-inducing toe-curlingly creepy.

One part of the creepy is... well.. Have you ever asked a firefighter if he'd like for you to wave a flag and sing a song whenever he passes you in the street? I can't see the difference between you, as a person, doing that for one firefighter, and having the entire nation doing it for all firefighters. He's a guy doing his job, and he fully deserves his paycheck and some respect - if that's not enough, he should get a bigger paycheck.

The 2011 veterans day in green bay had the audience in the stadium holding up signs, spelling out ""thank you veterans"" and ""thank you military"" ([here's a picture](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/6HoFynkLSYs/0.jpg)).

And there's the other part of the creepy. There's a shift from supporting soldiers to supporting the military - that's a shift from extending a hand to any person in uniform, to obeying the institution. 

The last part is simply that while I can talk to Americans and understand the words that come out their mouth, I fear that I will bever be able to fully connect with them, because at some level there's a fundamental difference between us, since they seem to think that this is okay.

Addendum:


[Taigatrommel](http://www.reddit.com/user/Taigatrommel) linked to Laurence W. Britt's ""Identifiers: An Examination of Fascism"" - you might have seen it as a 14-point list, warning against fascism, and it might be over the top, but I'm going to quote one of the points here, and italicize parts.

&gt;  **Powerful and continuing expressions of nationalism.** From the prominent displays of flags and bunting to the ubiquitous lapel pins, the *fervor to show patriotic nationalism*, both on the part of the regime itself and of *citizens caught up in its frenzy*, was always obvious. Catchy slogans, *pride in the military*, and *demands for unity* were common themes in expressing this nationalism. It was usually coupled with a suspicion of things foreign that often bordered on xenophobia.

This is what I see. People competing to see who can get the most ""support the troops""-stickers on their cars and swift social justice handed out to anyone who doesn't take part in the competition.

Merci pour le respect et le sarcasme... C'est drôle comme on a tous une tendance de réagir comme ça quand on est confronté par une réalité qui ne nous convient pas forcement. En plus, ça cache très bien la logique derrière l'argument.

Pour être plus précise alors, parlons sans analogies.
Si je comprends bien l'idée derrière l'argument : quand nous ne sommes pas d'accord avec la chaîne de distribution et/ou la répartition des bénéfices résultant du production des services et des produits, cette désaccord nous permet de les voler ? J'aime bien cette logique... Elle me permettrait bien de manger gratuitement sur le dos des traders de bourse !

La discussion au tour de la rémunération des artistes est importante mais c'est un sujet totalement à part qui n'a rien à voir avec ce que je parlais et ça confond les choses. Moi, je parle du vol des produits par téléchargement illégal où toi tu parlais du système de merde derrière l'industrie de film et musique.

Sur ton sujet, j'imagine qu'on serait totalement d'accord.

Sur mon sujet, je reste claire : le téléchargement illégal des produits dont on devrait payer est du vol, tout court. On vol à la fois : les efforts et les talents des artistes et le travail et l'expertise de toutes les personnes qui jouent un rôle dans la production et distribution de leurs produits.

Ce n'est pas parce que c'est facile et que beaucoup de monde le fait que ça rend ce type de vol acceptable ou juste.

My response to you is that if nations that are MUCH poorer than the U.S. per capita, and with less human and other resources can manage it, we certainly can.  That is really a non-response to your non-response, and thus becomes a petty dick-waving contest.  ""YUHUH!  NUHUH!""

My response to you would be the same to my Russian friend -- if there is enough political will, it will get done regardless of the size of the population.  Make no mistake, your lack of political will yourself is rather transparent.

My armchair solution is:  Tighten immigration sharply using the same methods that are working best for other countries, shrink the size of the military sharply, get rid of Medicare/Medicaid, and re-allocate it and other funds to real single payer universal healthcare.  Restructure social security ala Dutch or Swiss style pensions so that every senior can retire with dignity while the system stays solvent.

My armchair solutions won't amount to much though, because even people like you that somewhat agree with these ideas are more interested in obstructing the champions of said ideas than championing themselves.  As for almost half of America?  You can see the outcry that is still ongoing when we try to make the most simple health care reforms.  It is derided as ""socialism"", and many Americans would rather see others go without healthcare and social protections rather than seeing a single percent increase in their own tax base.

So if you haven't figured out why I like ""insulting other Americans,"" maybe now you'll see why.  And yes, I will fit in overseas because I'll be again surrounded by like minded people that think American politics are shit.  Utter shit.  

The nation that built a great interstate system in the 50's can't even retool it or find the space for public transportation to scale with the population growth and needs for major cities.

Lastly by outlawing abortion you're basically making a choice for someone else. This is fundamentally wrong, it's their body and they should have the choice to do what they want with it so long as their actions are not detrimental to society.  

Yes you can argue that if people don't want children they should stop having sex but that argument falls on deaf ears, sex is one of the highest forms of pleasure you can experience so it makes sense that people would want it.

I remember once sitting wit friends in Weimar talking about old TV shows from America.  One woman in the group (in her early 40's and raised in the GDR) couldn't remember the name of The Cosby Show and innocently(?) asked her friend (in German) ""What was the name of that show? Die mit dem Neger.""  I was pretty shocked and then realized the term is not NECESSARILY malicious, but there's just a word in her vocabulary for dark-skinned people.  ALL OF THEM.

I hate to get into this in a forum as limited as reddit.  I mean we could discuss this endlessly, but counter-examples are always plentiful.  Personally, I like to give most Germans the benefit of the doubt and assume (until presented with further evidence) that when someone says ""Neger,"" it's because they've no idea that language like that could be offensive.

Another behavior that bothers me much more is when I am talking to Germans and they complain to me about foreigners.  Because of my appearance and pretty good German skills, idiots will sometimes confide in me that certain foreigners bother them.  Without recalling they're talking to a foreigner.

From Danmarks Statistik's statistics bank: http://www.statistikbanken.dk/statbank5a/default.asp?w=1920

A small schematic of the numbers I made:
http://i.imgur.com/YevFA.jpg

Calculating on these numbers: 

10,5% of the population are immigrants and descendants

Commit 15,5% of the total crimes 2010.

16,3% of sexual crimes between 2005-2010

36,7% of rapes between 2005-2010

28% of murders between 2005-2010. 


These numbers include all immigrants, including the many from other scandinavian countries. I think that if you look at only the immigrants from muslim and african countries the numbers would be even higher, but that is more work than I care to do right now. (I would have to combine all the countries of origin together that I would want to look at ).

As for the other 72% all we know is that they are citizens because of laws stopping the Swedish Prison and Probation Service from releasing any information about ethnic origin about the inmates. ~~However the 28% alone means an over-representation of 2 times considering 14% of the people living in Sweden are immigrants.~~ (OK, that was some extremely faulty use of statistics by me. Many of the non-Swedish inmates might not even live in Sweden. Doesn't make your case much stronger though) How much higher the real number is is only guesswork but, considering the fact that immigrants without Swedish citizenship only accounts for about 6% of people living here, its likely vastly higher.

A very peculiar statement. What are they talking about here? Renewables or solar? Considering Sweden already produces well over half of its electricity from renewable sources and Norway is at over 96% renewables I really can't see how that statement can be made. Denmark is mostly using coal and natural(sic) gas but with an ever growing output of wind power. As for Finland it's pretty much the same as in Sweden, a mix of hydro and nuclear, though nuclear is a greater part of the mix there. The Scandinavian countries are among the best in the world at producing electricity with minimal greenhouse gas emissions so why should we adopt solar when it clearly is a worse alternative to the power plants we are currently using?

&gt; Greece will need a third bailout package from the euro zone, and the country's European creditors will have to find the money for it, according to a senior International Monetary Fund official. 

&gt; ""Greece will require additional financing, which may take the form either of official-sector involvement or of additional loans, hopefully on more favorable terms,"" Thanos Catsambas, an IMF alternate executive director, who represents Greece at the Fund's board, said in an interview. 

&gt; Mr. Catsambas is an IMF veteran with experience of Fund programs in Europe, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. In his current position, he has knowledge of the continuing negotiations between Greece and its troika of creditorsthe IMF, the European Union and the European Central Bank. 

&gt; Troika representatives are currently in Athens to assess Greece's situation and the possible disbursement of a 31 billion ($39.99 billion) loan, part of a second bailout package that totaled 173 billion. The payment is imperative for the Greek government to avoid running out of cash, but officials now suggest they don't expect a final decision on how to proceed with Greece until November. 

&gt; The coalition government of Prime Minister Antonis Samaras is facing growing public anger as it is tries to revive delayed structural reforms and implement fresh cutbacks of around 11.5 billion over the next two years. 

&gt; The creditors are unanimous that this is Athens' last chance if the financing is to continue. Without the loan payment, the government would run out of cash in a matter of weeks and would have to find new ways of meeting its current obligations, such as pensions and public-sector wages. In an extreme scenario, this may require leaving the euro zone and printing a new currency.

&gt; Mr. Catsambas called this last option ""an undesirable eventuality that will set the country back many decades."" 

&gt; Mr. Samaras has asked his euro-zone partners for a two-year extension to meet budget deficit reduction targets, something that would create an extra 20 billion funding gap for the period. The government has explored funding this with increased issuance of shorter-term treasury bills, thus avoiding direct extra financing from its creditors, but Mr. Catsambas said it would be ""totally unrealistic"" to assume that Greece could fill the gap entirely on its own. 

&gt; Mr. Catsambas insisted that it should be the euro zone and ECB that take the strain of filling the rest of the gap. 

&gt; ""Extension of repayment of the IMF [part of] loans is impossible as all terms and conditions of IMF loans to all countries are based on rules that are not negotiable,"" he said. The failure of Greece to implement its agreements, and the lack of a sustainable debt trajectory, make it impossible for the IMF, under its own charter, to lend any more. 

&gt; Mr. Catsambas said that the previous coalition government under Lucas Papademos, who took over from George Papandreou in November last year, estimated that ""only 22% of the commitments under the troika-supported program were implemented"" in 2011. Mr. Catsambas noted that the public sector still needs to be shrunk as a result. 

&gt; One option to restore Greece's debt trajectory to health would be another cut on the interest rate it pays on loans from euro-zone governments. More controversial options include having the ECB and euro-zone national central banks accept a rescheduling of their debts over a much longer period. The most controversial option would be for a 30% reductionor haircutin the value of their Greek bonds, said one official familiar with the discussions. 

&gt; Another scenario calls for euro-zone governments to accept haircuts on bilateral loans they made to Greece that could amount to between 30 billion and 50 billion. 

&gt; But no euro-zone creditor has signaled any intention to lend more money to Greece and the Eurosystem has shown no willingness to restructure its 50 billion portfolio of Greek debt, a step that would be a public-relations disaster for a central bank keen to reassure the German public and government that it won't print money simply to fund public deficits. 

&gt; Mr. Catsambas acknowledged that such official-sector involvement, or OSI as it is known, would be difficult to agree, however necessary it may seem. 

&gt; ""The difficulty with OSI is that it sets a possible precedent for other borrowers, which, of course, euro-zone countries and the ECB would rather avoid,"" he said. ",0,1347629839,null,0,false,0,c682csg,t3_ztyz2,t1_c682csg,t3_ztyz2,null,1429897245,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

&gt;Given the existence of black people among those at the top of all intellectual fields, I call bullshit on that statement.

That's to be expected, there are plenty of very, very intelligent black people, but, on average, white people tend to have a higher chance of being geniuses than blacks.

&gt;Their upbringing and environment defines their intellectual development morethan anything else.

Bold statement, too bad studies about the heritability of IQ have proven that genetics is the main factor. There is also the Minnesota Transracial Adoption study that seems to point in that direction too.

true,Dzukian,UNSA,United States of America,"Well, this got ugly quickly. A *Serbian* is lecturing Americans about praising people who kill others for no reason? A *Romanian* is telling us we live in a totalitarian state?

As an American, allow me to explain why the frankly hysterical response of Europeans to Americans' expressions of pride and support for our military is unwarranted. American identity is not about what language you speak or what religion you are or what your grandfather's ethnicity was. American identity is about two things: the supremacy of the Constitution as a founding document, and the faith that individuals can and *will* make the world a better place. The latter belief is why we produce so many entrepreneurs, so many volunteers, and so many missionaries (and also why America on the whole is more religious than other Western countries). This belief also inoculates Americans against communism and fascism. Those ideologies, which Europeans threw themselves into, never got widespread support in America. A core tenet of American belief--that individuals matter to the world--prevents communism or fascism from gaining adherents, since both of those ideologies hate the individual and crush individual achievement. 

Also, I think it's ludicrous that Europeans don't appreciate how resilient America's political structures are. You lot (except Britain and maybe Sweden) have been having revolutions and completely changing the structure of your countries every few decades. The last time America had a substantial change in the political structure was in the latter 1700s. We simply do not do wild political change in this country. We do things gradually.

Now that's labour force by occupation as opposed to income by sector, but both are relatively similar (I checked ;)). I'm sure all of the above countries will be profoundly saddened to hear their economies are all unsustainable.

Sorry, what? I can't hear you over the €12.5 billion euro bill we got for bailing out various eurozone countries, not to mention the guarantees we've given to, for example, Ireland.

&gt;Also the only country that doesn't need to aim to get the Euro.

So we've got the power to stay out of a currency that would be bad for us to join, what do you want, an apology?

&gt;Yes if you refuse to help when the EU is in crisis but take full advantage of it when it's doing well, I'd be surprised if you ever had a downturn again.

edit: You know what, I don't even care enough. You're spouting a good deal of uninformed horse shit, and it saddens me that my country is in a union with countries that contain people like yourself.

We've had no wars for more than 160 years but seen a lot wars and political shift around us maybe got us into thinking more carefully about protecting the nation. 

People here in general tend to be centre-right (about 2/3 of all voters for a lot of years now) or more left wing, depends on the publics priorities. So having the military is mostly a tradition, but it got reduced from 360'000 in 2003 to 120'000 to use the saved up money for better technology.

There's a movement to get rid of the military alltogether and many people think it is unnecessary but so far I have not seen a vote to actually remove it.

As we have conspription, most of the guys I know have been in training. Sounds like all they do is get drunk and/ or high and chill out in bunkers or sit somewhere for hours. Wouldn't expect those guys to be a serious threat to anyone...

Long story short, people are aware that having a military force is necessary but nobody gives a shit if you're in the military.

The US military thing probably seems weird to most in Switzerland. But then again most people I've talked to about the US were laughing about them and not really taking them serious.

1) The Palestinian economy is directly linked to the Israeli economy, any boycott will harm Palestinians far more than it will harm Israel, Israel's government and Israel's economy.

2) The boycotts actually target Israeli civil society, not the government. You are harming the Israeli people.

3) Boycotts work against moderation, they serve to further isolate and widen the gap between Israelis and Palestinians.

4) Most Israeli products and exports are high tech which nobody will realistically boycott, instead your boycotts target a bit of fruit and vegetable which will achieve exactly... nothing.

5) Many Palestinians are actually employed by settlers and receive three times the wage they'd receive elsewhere in the West Bank. PA Arabs and Israeli Arabs that work on the settlements are protected by Israeli law and receive the same wages and benefits.

6) A successful boycott will only serve to empower Hamas by weakening the PA, forcing people to turn to Hamas. Not that you boycotters would mind this.

7) The legal status of the settlements is actually a disputed matter, despite what rulings or judgments you might say, nobody has ever shot down the legal case for the settlements, instead they rely on liberal and often faulty/politicized interpretations of international law.

Another example is that the UK and Ireland (non-Schengen) do not need work permits in Schengen countries.

Small edit: also there's no such thing as work ""visa"", there's an authorisation that needs to be applied for.

Small edit 2: there's also no mention of the word ""work"" on the wiki page for the [Schengen agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Agreement). Simply no internal border controls (usually) between member states.

Edit 3: Consider this also. Bulgaria and Romania had earlier planned dates of joining Schengen.

Right, while in countries like Ireland, Austria, Spain and The Netherlands, 70-80% of people are in favour of the EU, only 25-32% of UK citizens are. But this is only according to the official Eurobarometer survey so I wouldn't take my word for it.

If you think the UK economy is sustainable on the long term you're wrong on [many](http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/03b1c1f0-cc1b-11e1-aac1-00144feabdc0.html) [levels](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/8913726/Economists-say-UK-economic-growth-is-unsustainable.html). In addition, due to its high dependance on the financial services, the [UK has the lowest growth rate of the G7 thanks to the recent financial crisis](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19504523). As you know it was the taxpayer that had to bail out its banks, which shows how unsustainable it is to depend on low corporate tax as an economic growth medium.

Actually, it's 77.8% of GDP as of [last year](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2012.html) but obviously you miss the point, Djibouti's economy is mostly made up of services, but this doesn't mean it's unsustainable. ([Although I'll add as a point that while the services sector grows or remains stable, the manufacturing sector has decreased](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/gva/gross-domestic-product--preliminary-estimate/q1-2012/stb-q1-2012.html)) What makes it unsustainable is the UK's complete dependance on *financial services* based in the City. This goes hand in hand with the next point, where the UK keeps rejecting EU plans on the basis that it would harm its economy. I.E. [They'd rather save their own arses than carry on the European project.](http://www.euronews.com/2011/06/30/uk-s-cameron-rejects-eu-bank-budget-plan/) Yes they do the bare minimum such as bail outs which are required by law for countries that want to remain in the EU. Even a country like Portugal had to provide bail out money for Greece. Interesting, because all of a sudden being in the EU seems like an economic advantage for the UK.

Not to mention the social, legislative and political policies which the UK has towards the EU such as not being part of Schengen or rejecting the Tobin tax. 

As for joining the Euro, you can't be part of a federation of nation states with a different currency. It's as simple as that and if the British fail to grasp that then they'll just have to prod along while the rest of the EU does what it needs without considering the UK.

&gt;US sanctions take toll on Khartoum  
  
&gt;July 23 2012  
    
&gt;By Katrina Manson in Khartoum  
  
&gt;When Sudan’s president Omar al-Bashir invited Arab leaders and investors to witness the launch of a $1bn sugar factory earlier this year, he was forced into an abrupt and humiliating cancellation.  
  
&gt;Unknown to Sudanese managers, the company providing plant software for Africa’s largest sugar plant had been bought out by a US company, which immediately applied sanctions, refusing to initiate satellite technology that engages machinery from thousands of miles away.  
  
&gt;“They didn’t tell us, we just found out when we pushed the button,” says Fareed Omer Medani, company secretary of Kenana Sugar Company, a state-backed entity that has a 30 per cent share in the White Nile Sugar Company, which has also attracted Gulf and Egyptian money for the project, intended to make cash-strapped Sudan a net exporter.  
  
&gt;The White Nile plant eventually opened in July, months later than planned, after a sanctions waiver licence was granted to the software company. The delay highlighted how difficult it has become for Sudan to find a way out of economic crisis in light of the continuing US sanctions regime.  
  
&gt;Khartoum officials often argue that they have learnt to live without the US in particular and the west in general, by trading with Asia, and borrowing money from the Gulf. But the sanctions have been more keenly felt since the booming oil economy turned to bust after last year’s secession by oil-rich South Sudan, prompting scattered protests calling for the overthrow of the regime. Repealing sanctions could help draw in foreign investment and allow the government to borrow again on international markets.  
  
&gt;But the politics of sanctions are caught in limbo with the US holding out for a change in behaviour by Khartoum without providing any incentives, and Khartoum sceptical after Washington failed to honour past promises to reward the north for allowing South Sudan to secede. “How many pressure points do you need; you’ve already got all the country in the full Nelson, and how’s that working for you, US?,” asks one government adviser.  
  
&gt;A dispute over transport fees for southern oil exported via northern infrastructure saw the south shut down its entire production this year, depriving the north of yet more money. Without oil, the impact of sanctions is more keenly felt, helping prompt the Khartoum regime to seek a deal over security and finances with the South before an August 2 deadline. Failure to reach a deal could lead to more sanctions.  
  
&gt;“Sanctions may now be more effective and obviously they make things more difficult,” says a Sudan analyst in Khartoum. “Sanctions have always been more punishing to the people, but they are not linked in protesters’ minds. I don’t think sanctions serve anyone’s purposes now. Had they [the US] dealt with it more honestly, they could have made them count,” he said, citing the US refusal to remove sanctions when the South separated.  
  
&gt;The US first designated Sudan a state sponsor of terrorism in 1993, after World Trade Center bombings were linked to the late al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, then living in Khartoum. Although Sudan expelled Mr bin Laden in 1996, US sanctions in 1997 banned financial, economic and trade relations with the country, and the US launched cruise missile strikes against Khartoum the next year.  
  
&gt;Everything from factories to historic bookshops that can no longer import longed-for texts have been affected. All dollar-denominated money wires must be cleared through New York, no matter where they originate, curtailing diaspora remittances. In a country rich in investment potential but without Visa banking services, many visitors arrive carrying wads of dollars.  
  
&gt;“The impact of sanctions has been very significant but it hurts people who have no issues with the US – the impact is on the wrong people,” says Osama Daoud Abdellatif, Sudan’s leading businessman. He says sanctions have forced his own $1bn turnover conglomerate, DAL Group, to “discontinue a lot of lines” and has made banking “a real challenge”.  
  
&gt;The US has set aside $213m in its 2013 budget for debt relief but Mr Lyman says its release too will depend on “political changes”. He also says of sanctions that the US “would respond within legislative limits if humanitarian access was allowed and political talks were under way” in South Kordofan and Blue Nile.

Such statements skew the true situation. For example, the US never managed to close down the [Ho Chi Minh trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh_trail), meaning that there was a constant threat looming above the whole western border of South Vietnam, despite the US winning all major battles. The US would have had to continue fighting like that for decades to contain the commies. And for what purpose, exactly?

Given the political climate of South Vietnam, there was very little to fight for:

* [1962 South Vietnamese Independence Palace bombing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1962_South_Vietnamese_Independence_Palace_bombing)

The US was protecting a corrupt, violent, and [inherently unstable regieme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaders_of_South_Vietnam) to begin with, and the means they were using - like [Agent Orange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_Orange) - were and remain to be simply unjustifiable. The US could not for many reasons go on fighting for decades to follow, and thus the collapse of South Vietnam was nothing else than just a matter of time.

People like to point out that hardly anybody was affected by the war. Afterall, only .003% of America's population was truly affected during the war. Wrong. A state of war affects a national consciousness and create towering social constructs. The people might not be rationing, they might not be militarized, but their minds are absorbing images. I remember, despite being young, watching the invasion of Baghdad. Seeing the explosions, think, like the social animal that I am, that I was *there*, a part of me, a part of my unit, was out there.

~~~~~~~~

What this thread indicates is a huge separation between European and American mindsets. Only the libertarians and anarchist sets, maybe a few feminists, will be vehemently anti-troop in America. The rest are not because, true or not, our minds are in a state of war. It will be that way until the war movies in theaters are not documentaries, but historical fictions.

I disagree. This is obviously not, for most people, a consciously-understood state of mind.

Dude, its our *universities* that are better. Our high schools suck dick. Gets your facts straight.



The, rest is pretty much spot on.... but, I'm going to have to go with what my patriotic friend said and ask, ""What the hell do you mean by a revolution?""

Like, do you want us to have a new government completely? Do you want us to have a civil war? Do you want us to rewrite the constitution?

Because, I'm fine with a lot of politicians. A lot of them are corrupt, sure, buts the name of the game. Look at Japan, look at Europe, and you'll find the politicians are corrupt there too. Do you want us to have a civil war? That doesn't even make sense. Who would fight who about what? Abortion? noooo. ha. Now, do you want us to rewrite the Constitution? 

See... heres the thing. We *like* our Constitution. We don't just like it because its old. We don't just like it because its tradition. We like it because its done, for the most part, a pretty good job. It was able to (1) fend off a second British attack, (2) peacefully expand the democracy (by which I mean that territories could become states. The acquisition of territories... well, you know), (3) was able to create a government strong enough to deal with rebellion, (4) was able to sufficiently change with the times to allow for populism, (5) was able to create a semi-welfare state, (6) was able to fight a lot of wars against a lot of nasty people.


In other words, the Constitution proved itself to be pretty good historically. It was adaptable, but sturdy. It creates a single member district voting system, which keeps our parties moderate, but dissimilar: coalitions are built into the party structure by the very nature of our government. This is good, because it means we never have extremists. A Nazi party won't be able to rise because it'll just split the vote with moderates.


So... again, what are you asking for? The destruction of the Republican party? They're already doing that for everybody else to watch. Do you want us to change our foreign policy? (True story: most of us like *that*, too, its pretty democratic and one dimensional). Do you want us to build our own welfare state? We're getting there.

Think *very hard* about how Congressmen would react if one of them walked up to the podium and said, ""The Constitution of the 1700s is no longer acceptable to the realities of twenty-first century life, we have to write a new constitution to adapt to twenty-first century realities.""

Are they, really? With the exception of maybe the British (who are almost as good at assimilating immigrants as Americans), European societies are essentially inward-looking and communitarian. Germany is for Germans; Sweden is for Swedes; Lithuania is for Lithuanians. They might pretend, to Americans and Arabs and Koreans, that they is not true, or that Turkish-Germans are Germans and Somali-Swedes are Swedes, but that belief is not really deeply believed in those cultures. Turks are Turks; Somalis are Somalis; and they are emphatically *not* Germans or Swedes. Any society that is primarily ethnocentric can't really celebrate the individual, except as part of the ethnic collective. Moreover, the more socialist policies adopted by European governments take the stance that ""people must give so that no one is left behind,"" and that stance is accepted by the majority of the public. In America, this argument is less persuasive, since most people don't think that an individual's failure to prosper is the responsibility of society at large.

true,Dzukian,UNSA,United States of America,"Wow, you devoted *way* more effort into this than was necessary. I'll just hit the biggies.

&gt; Huh. You're saying that political structures always need to be stable. So despite the fact that the Isreali government is openly pro-war, openly admits to killing people, it's more important that they're politically stable? 

Stability is the most-demanded political good of all time. Nobody anywhere likes instability. That's why dictators appear in unstable countries: because people don't like not knowing what their country will look like tomorrow. America has a political system that has undertaken enormous, society-changing political decisions (like desegregation, women's suffrage, and, obviously, the Civil War), but it has never fallen into instability or had to change the fundamentals of its governing system. We don't *need* to trash our constitution to allow for reform, even huge, widespread reform. We might not get every ""progressive"" desire immediately, but you can bet that in a generation or two it'll be a fact of life here, and adopted by a majority of the population. This is only unacceptable to people who don't understand long-term thinking, children who point and say ""gimme gimme gimme"" at every shiny object they see. The overall good of maintaining social stability--a constant throughout human history--overrides the immediate good to individuals or small groups in our society.

So yes, stability with the possibility of gradual reform *is* the best state of government, and always will be. Or do you think people make up constitutions planning on them being completely thrown out in 10/50/100 years' time? People write constitutions with the intention of making them last: when those constitutions get thrown out, it's because the people who wrote them *failed*.

&gt; Also, what other developed countries have had a coup or a revolution since 1948?

See, thats not actually true. A Prime Minister is generally the ""head of government."" What this means is he runs the government in day-to-day business. Then you have a chancellor or premier or even a monarch that is a head-if-state. The former is where most of the power is, while the latter is both a figure head and *the* most important diplomatic member of the state's foreign department. 

A President is both head-of-state and head-of-government. 

&gt;It is impossible that 300+ million people in the US have only black or white political views.

This true. However, the way our political system works (I wrote it somewhere else in this thread) is that the two parties are less like parties then they are coalitions. In your average proportional representation system, like Belgium or Romania or half of Mexico, every certain amount of votes means a party gets a certain number of seats in the legislative body. This means that parties can become nationalistic and regionalistic and they always have power as long as their regional bodies vote, ""Aye."" Then they form a coalition.

A two party system arises because party competition forces different belief system to coalesce *before* election. That is why our parties have some intrinsic, sometimes contradictory elements (the Tea Party hates Keynesian policy, for example, but believes in military Keynesianism). 

However, our party system also creates one supreme good: extreme parties cannot get elected. As much as the world may hate him, Bush was not extreme, but a moderate. He worked on immigration reform, expanded some welfare systems, and tried to fiddle with SS. Obama's healthcare plan is moderate. This trend holds throughout history: America could never elect a Hitler, like the Germans, nor could we vote for a communist revolution over night. 

**In other words, America exists as a dictatorship of the moderates**. And that is why I like my Constitution. 

&gt;Why? So that my people, of whom 99.99% of people were innocent, have to suffer? For what? We again come to the point of what gives you the right? Who are you to attack a sovereign nation, and then claim that ""it's for their own good""?

America's two party system ensures what I called in another post **the dicatorship of the moderates.** Basically, in other governments, coalitions are formed after the parties take their places in the government. In America, it is the opposite. We form parties from factions. This means that parties have the ""moderate whip.""

The chances of a certain parliament going nationalistic are slim. It has been happening in the past few years in Europe, gaining some traction, but nowhere near enough to form a government on their own. For example, in 2008 elections the SRS (Serbian Radical Party) won ~37% of the seats in the parliament and was the #1 party. But they did not form the government. In 2012 elections, they campaigned on a nationalistic level. They won 4.6% of the seats which is below the 5% threshold making them ineligible to be in the parliament at all.

It's not like you'd have a retired postal workers day, is it? You'd never consider having a national Pensioners day, would you?

Having a national veterans day confers a very explicit honour on everyone who's ever served in the military. It makes a statement, that everyone who's ever served in the military is automatically honourable.

(Not that you can't be honourable and in the military, but it's silly to treat it as a given fact)

But wait, there's more.

Alongside the fact that there *is* such a day, there's also the clamoring to be the most patriotic, to put on the biggest display, and to be the most patriotic. 

What happens to the person who says: ""I think veterans day is a private and personal thing, a solemn occasion that should be held with the veterans you know. I think it's a bad thing that you make a public spectacle out of it, and I refuse to partake"".

Would such a person be shunned? Would other people look down on him? Would his house be TP'd or firebombed? (mostly kidding about the last one)

Maybe I could make one last simile (though I am so *very* bad at making similes, so if it doesn't make sense, please ignore it).

You could think of it as praying in public. Once you start praying in front of other people, a race begins to be the most pious, to give the best prayer, and.. maybe not pray about the things that really matter - not mention that you'd like strength to be able to handle the fact that your youngest son is a dealer, stuff like that.

Consider this: are we sufficiently well defended now, i.e. with our current military capabilities, is there now or will there ever be a military threat to the integrety of a member state? 

No, if one additional factor holds: France and the UK will use their nuclear deterrent to protect all other member states. This can be done via NATO. 

If this is true, unless we get some internal military problems, we are secure. 

Now what additional benefits does a common military bring next to reduced spending (I won't talk of the practicality or the inital costs of restructuing)?

Is it really worth to sacrifice life and health of millions of your citizens, for what... for few million ex-communists? Hell no.

Ok. So no nuclear weapons, we need to send just fighters and tanks there.

true,SPRM,SCOT,German studying in Scotland,"The purpose of military power is not only strictly defence of a given territory. In international relations, to put it very simplified, people will listen to you more if you carry a big stick, even if you don't ever intend to actually use it against them and your intentions are completely peaceful. Military power is not the only ""currency"" in the international system - that much is true - but the ability to theoretically project power over greater distances increases the diplomatic weight of a given political entity.

Now, I realize many people would not be in favour of Europe getting more influence globally and that is a valid stance, but with China's influence growing, the US trying to counter-balance it, Brazil, India and other emerging countries being reluctant to fully integrate in the current order of international relations, I see European influence still as a good one all things considered that should not be marginalized because people will disregard the EU for apparent lack of hard power. 

Also, you can never know when new threats arise that will indeed need a strong military that is capable of quickly adapting to it in a coordinated way that does not involve political decision-making between 27+ Member States who all have different capabilities and incompatible structures.  

An EU military with an EU headquarters works better in the long run for the above-described purposes than 27 armed forces with 27 headquarters, 27 chiefs-of-staff who all have an opinion as well as 27 governments.

Edit: Plus, as you said also but seemed to disregard as being a major argument in favour of unifying militaries, it would make it possible to get more punch for less money which, considering the current tight budgets everywhere, is a very attractive aspect of it. Not to mention the impossibility of waging war against each other in Europe again because there is no other military to wage such a war against.

Edit #2: I just wanted to stress further that I think the EU is actually doing a good job in foreign policy in that it combines all possible approaches to it, i.e. civilian as well as military means, and that I would prefer that to continue further (in contrast to a U.S. foreign policy that is heavily dominated by the Pentagon), just with a more capable and ""stream-lined"" stick to go with the already quite well-developed olive branch and wallet. 

Edit #3: Just to give an example of where a European military would be beneficial, look at Operation Atalanta at the Horn of Africa to combat piracy. It is the biggest military operation of the EU so far under its CSDP framework, a lot of nations are taking part in it, France being one of the biggest. The problems that arise there, inter-alia, are that although being part of an EU force, many nations still not only consult with the EU HQ in Northwood, UK, but also with their respective national headquarters. This results in quite different behaviour from the Member States: e.g. France has a habit of hunting down pirates with helicopters, whereas Germany is far more reluctant to do just that (and also doesn't have the capabilities to). It's a result of different strategic cultures among the armed forces, which is made worse by no unified command structure outside of specific operations. The HQ in Northwood is only set up for that particular operation and not responsible for anything beyond that. The different policies and behaviour of the armed forces make the operation less effective and efficient, lowering the impact of the EU abroad which, in this case, serves very real and important goals (securing sea trade lanes and combating pirates that destabilize Somalia). It would be beneficial if the EU could eventually overcome these problems, but that can only happen through more institutional centralisation from which a more common strategic culture, enhanced trust between the armed forces and, in the end, a coherent and consistent EU foreign and security policy could emerge.

As you can see, most EU member states are in it. 

What does NATO do? Effectively, they are an organisation that allows co-ordinated military attacks and government communications in war-times, have military operations together in order to ensure practical training, and are in the possession of scenarios for attacks on member states. AFAIK, all member states are briefed in how to act in such scenarios.

What I agree is that this still doesn't tell you how NATO will react if it's not only the use of force against a weak enemy, but a real threat to Europe (especially since the specifics of any reaction will be down to national institutions).

However, things don't go from OK to INVASION in a heartbeat. If we have a moderate government in Moscow, NATO suffices. If the government in Russia turns increasingly hostile, we will know. This is true for any government in the world. Ergo, right now we are in no need for additional defensive measures.

Let's assume things change, for example in Russia. This is the first, long time-window in which a co-ordinated defensive response can be established. Even Putin cannot pull off a complete transformation in his foreign politics in case he doesn't want the entire rest of the world become heavily suspicious and possibly hostile.

Let's say that we have an invasion, and no common defense was proposed. First, you cannot do an invasion without the whole world knowing - the US alone monitors the whole world 24/7, and Europe has similar capabilities if we had something akin to Galileo (which I do agree would have to be done on a European level). You do not mobilise troops and tanks and whatnot without having a relatively long time-window for just about anyone to notice. By the time the first enemy steps across the border of a European member state, all European militaries will be on high alert.

Now let's look at who's gonna help whom. Russia makes a full front invasion on the Baltics. Now should anyone help? First of all, in theory, NATO member states are required to form a common defense. But, for some reason, the US wants to lose all credibility in Europe and around the world and states that the alliance was a big joke and they're gonna sit it out across the pond (that's their loss of world power right there).

Now it's just the the EU/Rest of NATO against Russia. I agree that such members as Turkey will probably go ""Meh, not worht it"". But what about all other member states? Now we have a scenario which is open to complete specuation. You could be right, in that Europe defragements. Or maybe we won't, band together and form that single military.

The point is though, how do we get to that decisive moment. By a string of highly unlikely events. Of course they could happen, sure. For Russia to turn hostile, it takes not much imagination. For Russia to turn hostile without anybody caring, more so. For Russia to turn hostile, nobody caring, to the US opting out of NATO, and all other member states going ""Fuck it, let's all be rolled over by Russia for a few more months of independence and peace"", you need quite a lot of fantasy.

Sure, in that last case, a unified military will be helpful. But there's plenty of time to get that in case an external threat does arise, because they do not come from nothing out of thin air.

Yet if they have time to arise, we have time to react. But if we already have our hammer, I assure you we want to hit us some nails. And for that to see, you do not need much imagination.

I also don't really think that, as soon as the EU would have a strong and unified military, it would start using it in a similar way like the US does. The thinking in political and military institutions in Europe (maybe with the exception of the UK) is quite different from the American way of conducting foreign policy. As I said already, the EU strives to use the whole range of foreign policy tools, often emphasizing civilian over military means, whereas the Americans have, over the last few decades, increased the tasks the military is supposed to do abroad while marginalizing to some extent their civilian diplomatic tools.

That is a qualitatively different approach to how to conduct foreign policy.

Edit: As an example, I will again point to Somalia and the Horn of Africa (since I have done research on that). The EU is not only conducting its Operation Atalanta there, but also has several efforts in place to improve the situation in Somalia. See e.g. EUTM Somalia, a training mission
dedicated to improving the capabilities of Somali security forces; EUCAP Nestor, a civilian effort
to “strengthen maritime capacities in the Horn of Africa”; and financial as well as technical support
to the African Union's military mission to Somalia (AMISOM). Granted, the training is indirectly military in nature as well, but it all forms together the so-called *Comprehensive Approach* to maximize the impact of EU policies, both civilian and military.

I cannot argue your world view as that is your personal opinion obviously, but keep in mind that having a big military can also lead to more people listening to you and following your advice precisely because your military is big, thus making it unnecessary to use it at every instance. Plus, European leaders are, as far as I see it, quite considerate regarding the use of military force from a relative perspective, e.g. in comparison with the US (although that is changing in America as well at the moment with the isolationist movement getting more traction and more and more people being opposed to the war efforts in the Middle East).

&gt;  Strategic interests are without cultural constraints [...]

Then why, do you think, didn't Germany take part in the bombing of Libya although Britain and France did? You could answer that Angela Merkel did not join in the campaign because she feared negative results for state and federal elections, but then again: why would bombing Libya be unpopular in the German public? German soldiers wouldn't really be put to risk, it might help the Libyan rebels and Germany would look good among its NATO friends. Yet, actually using our military is very unpopular in Germany precisely for historical and cultural reasons that thus impact our foreign policy. States are no black boxes that operate rationally as e.g. [realism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations#Realism) would suggest (in my opinion).

You could answer that Angela Merkel did not join in the campaign because she feared negative results for state and federal elections, but then again: why would bombing Libya be unpopular in the German public? German soldiers wouldn't really be put to risk, it might help the Libyan rebels and Germany would look good among its NATO friends. Yet, actually using our military is very unpopular in Germany precisely for historical and cultural reasons that thus impact our foreign policy. States are no black boxes that operate rationally as e.g. realism would suggest (in my opinion). 

How is this connected to strategic interests? How is Libya strategically relevant to Germany? This has more to do with internal politics than that, as you quite correctly pointed out.

true,SPRM,SCOT,German studying in Scotland,"&gt; How is this connected to strategic interests? How is Libya strategically relevant to Germany?

Depends on what you consider strategic interests. The other NATO members, as well as other international partners, are quite displeased with Germany's performance recently in the NATO and UN exactly because of its reluctance to actually use its military. If you consider international influence and foreign policy clout as desirable, you could very well argue that it was in Germany's strategic interest to take part in the Libya campaign, even if Libya itself was of less importance to it.

&gt; German anti-war culture is irrelevant if the French and British want to go to war (or just a large number of EU citizens from all across Europe).

That is definitely a point. But consider this: one point of a unified military is that not all countries need to hold on to all military capabilities. Rather, some countries would provide vital capabilities A, while others would take care of capabilities B. This means that, in order to conduct a successful military operation, a larger amount of countries has to agree on the importance of said proposed operation to serve their interests (whichever they may be). This is already done in part, look for example at the Dutch who will abandon all their tank forces, relying on Germany and others to defend it in the event of a land war in Europe (which is very unlikely to begin with). That also means that, in order to have sufficient tanks ready for a military campaign, Germany would need to be on board. This could turn out very ugly when one country is black-mailing all the others with its veto, but it can also lead to more consensus-finding efforts in which more opinions and perspectives are involved in the initial decision-making process. Necessity could breed cooperation and integration because no one is able to go to war alone anymore. 

&gt; And their view is irrelevant if the EU parliament is able to act militarily in representation of all of Europe.

Who elects the EU parliament though? The citizens of Europe, including the Germans. If they elect parties that, at some point, support a military operation, then that operation will be carried out and it will be legitimate (assuming they manage to find ways to reduce the democratic deficit of the European parliament and other institutions - which they are working on). 

&gt; Libya was a good example of how not to go to war.

Do you say that for political or military-strategic reasons? From a military perspective (and I'm no expert on specific military strategy), I think it was quite successful.

Countries in South East Asia, combined with traditional allies since World War II like Australia and New Zealand are likely the most important friends of the U.S. in the future, meaning that the importance of NATO and Europe might take a backseat in American foreign policy.

This means that Europe will probably need to carry its own weight increasingly and stop relying on U.S. military power as much. This is going to be a painful process of re-adjusting national budget priorities when Europeans start to realize that a well-equipped and capable military is not only expensive, but also necessary. 

To mitigate this fact, a unified European military could be able to reduce overall defence spending in the mid- and long-term because of now-existent parallel and inefficient structures.

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;My medicine to get back on growth track would be to...
&gt;
&gt;* Tear down labour laws, when you make firing easy you make hiring easier.
&gt;* Tear down bureaucracy, starting a new joint stock company shouldn't take more than two days, and operating one should be as easy as possible.
&gt;* Put more money on bringing foreign direct investment into the country, and give more support for export companies to expand in the continent and oversees.

It would be unpopular but I fully agree with you. It's a shame that you need to go through a sea of red tape to get anything done and that it's easier to shut down a plant than to fire 10 people working in it.

&gt;And to make progress with fixing the balance of payments...
&gt;
&gt;* Raise consumption taxes, target for example import/sale of non-essential items such as cars with 50% or 100% car tax.
&gt;* Raise energy taxes, target fossil fuel based energy as those are all imports.

Err... no? We're already being taxed insanely and if we want the economy to grow, we should be doing everything to not raise them. I agree that lowering them would be difficult with this debt but increasing them would just shrink the economy further, reduce consumption and drive away investors.

&gt;However if we go back to public-private partnerships? What is wrong with them? Many other countries have build infrastructure with this model, including Finland and there are no problems with this model.

Our public-private partnerships were done through shadier means than they were made there. In short, sometimes the openness of these partnerships were disputed (for example, out of 10 companies, not the one which would be cheaper won but rather the company which the manager was friend of the politician x) and more often than not, in cases of success, the benefits went to the privates and the losses were supported by the state - aka corruption.",0,1347707283,null,0,false,0,c68hgqe,t3_zwolb,t1_c68hgqe,t1_c68h572,null,1429904472,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

&gt; Why are you moving the goal posts? The argument was about settlements

gocarsno stated crimes commited by palestinans such as Suicide bombings, rocket attacks

for wich you replied

Trap people in a cage and they will get desperate.

However , The  suicde bombing were prominant during an era when no new settelments had been formed (see Oslo occurds) the rocket attacks started also in 2001 during the [second intifada](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_intifada).

The first Palestinan suicde bomers happened in  1993 (in a time that people could traval freely between the west bank Israel and Gaza) - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehola_Junction_bombing

&gt; Why would you even mention the Gaza blockade?

The phrase ""trap people in a cage"" is most commenly used to describe Gaza Blockade and military restrication via  checkpoints in Judea and Samaria, before 2000 there had no been no check points (actually there was free traval via border crossing due to the osslo aggrements).

upto June 1989 any person from Gaza or Judea and samaria could traval to where he wishes in israel (The june restriction was for criminals and ex-cons).That was after the first intifada.

In March 1993 there had new traval restriction till Sep 1993,restriction become after a palestinan killed several Israelis.

Only in 2000 there had been another change in restriction (no one in or out) after the Start of the Second intifada.

Source  : btselem and peace now publication.

&gt;&gt;  one of the most peaceful eras

&gt; During which the settlements were still being built and people still being expelled.

Contrary to your claim , when people tried to start new outposts (via buying land or taking public land) they had been kicked out by Israeli forces (see migron case for example in 1999).

Could you state a single credibale source that state that the second intifada started do to ""Settlements in Palestine and the stealing of Palestine land "" ?

&gt; before the Hamas was even formed, so how about that? 

Hamas was formed as an offspring to the Muslim brotherhood  based on the Islamic fundamentalism prinsapels in the early 1980's during the first Intifada.

source : 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas

The areas Hamas rose had not been in areas land had been ""stolen"" rather land had being given back to people expeled in 1936,1939 and 1948 (All jews had been expeled in several waves by the British and then the Egyptians).

&gt; Are you seriously trying to defend the right of someone to take your land and claiming that they're in the wrong for being upset?

The cited event are not being people upset rather a premediated murder of civilans.

the Israeli - Palestinan conflict ain't black and white , in many cases land that went back to the orrignal west bank and Gaza refugees land owenrs in some cases there had been illigal land take over by people like in cases of Palestinans illigal outposts and Israeli illigal outposts (wich contrary to the Palestinans are evicted) in others the gov took land for public use .

In many cases people would sell a house to an Israeli and then claim it had been stolen (like with the house of peace for example) -

true,neptoon_,null,null,"Hi! I originally came to Germany to study at university way back when and also always wanted to move back. I finally did so last December and I'm still here (in Germany). I'm an American and how the bureaucracy handles your application is dependent upon your citizenship. Americans enjoy a certain degree of preferential treatment (see link below).
My best effort at your questions:
1) I don't think you can reset the counter on your tourist 'visa' (i.e. you entered the country as a tourist and can stay for up to three months) even if you leave the EU/Schengen raum, but I think it'd be best to ask the consulate in the US about this or see if there's any info on an official government website about it. I entered Germany without a special visa on 12/1, got my Anmeldung on 2/6 and applied online for an appointment with the Ausländerbehörde (Immigration Authority) on 2/8. The first available appointment was on 3/7 which means that I was 'illegal' for one week from 3/1 to 3/7. I tried going to the Sprechstunden at the Ausländerbehörde at the end of February but they said if I already had an appointment then they couldn't see me. However, nobody gave me a hard time about being 'late'. I had to wait until the end of May for my visa to come through but the Ausländerbehörde gave me an official document (with a hologram!) indicating that my visa was being processed in case I got into trouble during that waiting period.
2) The new jobseekers visa has been mentioned in the news but I applied under the old/existing criteria. It looks like you need certain qualifications to come under this umbrella (such as you work in IT/computers or a highly desired field for which there is a shortage of qualified workers here).
3) The Ausländerbehörde takes care of both your work visa and residence permit. You need to get a place to live and an Anmeldung in order to complete your visa paperwork. 
You must obviously provide a valid reason why you're applying for a visa. For example, you're coming here to work, either as a freelancer or as an employee, and each of these has its own requirements (i.e. as a freelancer, you have to prove to the government that your employment outlook is excellent, or as an employee, your employer has to convince the government that they need YOU as opposed to another European to do the job). Or, you can apply for an extended tourist visa (you have to prove to them that you have money and this is only for another 3 months). Or, you're coming here to join with your German partner and you're getting married; or you have ancestral connections that allow you to claim citizenship. 
There are lawyers who can help with this stuff and the Ausländerbehörde also has a counseling center but I can't find it online. I applied as a freelancer but had German friends help me with the paperwork. Good luck with fulfilling your dream!

You forgot to consider that your purchasing power is much higher there, if the cars cost the same in Portugal as they do in Finland, then they're comparatively much more expensive here - your GDP (PPP) is about 50% higher than ours, so I guess that's more arguments for the lowering of taxes here rather than an increase of them.

&gt;Just a question, are car taxes calculated based on emissions, so low emissions Toyota's get smaller taxes than more polluting BMW's?

I don't know for sure, but I wouldn't be too surprised. Though since now all cars must have unleaded gasoline, I'm sure the differences between the pollution are vestigial. Again, I'm not really sure of these as I don't have a car nor do I have knowledge of these laws.

I myself was more afraid that renegotiating them would undermine Portugal's reputation as a trusted place where to invest, but as there seems to be no question that these shouldn't be renegotiated, then that should be done.

I wouldn't say the agreement with the international partners needs to be renegotiated, that would harm us more than it could possibly benefit us.

true,sasp777,null,null,"I'll try giving you a serious answer (and explain why I am a socialist). First of all let's assume that both solutions (liberal vs socialist) aim to improve humanity's condition (i.e. that none is deliberately trying to screw people over).

The basic difference between the neo-liberal solution (vs socialist one) is really simple. If you leave the markets unregulated, the neo-liberal (i.e. Hayek) ``shows'' that good things will come out of it (total wealth will increase, society will improve) , while the Marxist viewpoint is that wealth will concentrate in the hands of a tiny minority, which will rule with an iron fist and the rest will live in slave like conditions (like a cyberpunk novel).  There has been a ton of literature on the subject (the first volume of the Capital just describes this), but for me the best example of a free market is the Apple store. 

If you look at the applications sold there, you will see that a tiny minority makes all the money. It could be because they are better, luckier or whatever, but I think this is a very natural thing in free markets, wealth concentrates (and there has been a lot of modern research in Complexity Sciences, a field that incidentally Hayek pioneered, that shows this). How will the rest support themselves in an total free market scenario ? By working for the elite few (hence the distinction between proletarians vs bourgeois). 

Another point is that Marx (or anyone else) hasn't described communism (apart from some quotes - contrary to what most people will tell you the Communist Manifesto does NOT describe communism), and nobody knows what it looks like or if humanity is ready for it.  

I support policies that aggressively redistribute wealth, because I think that the market will equilibrate to untold misery for most people, and exceptional privilege for a few.  I also think we will see more and more of this as EU deregulates further, we will keep seeing more of this, and you will feel this extreme polarisation in your backside (most likely you won't have the skills (nor the resources) to compete in a free market, thus having to be sell yourself for almost nothing.

True, but in both Portugal and Finland oil and cars are imported, thus they have negative impact on balance of payments. By taxing both cars and oil what can be achieved is that usage of these two are as low as possible. The problem comes of course that in some point taxes will start to decrease economic activity so much that it will have negative impact to balance of payments. That is why for example the Finnish state taxes less cars that have lower emissions and thus consume less fuels.

However, it is a good question on should the taxes go up or down, which is really better in this situation?

To lift people out of such cultures of poverty, a simple handout is not enough, but in spite of your protestations, luckily, that's also not quite how most welfare systems work, though they sure could work better.

A problem with a common military would be the danger of it being mis-used -- think military industrial complex or military influence in politics (the US keep the National Guards in each State and the liberal weapons law to defent against possible military abuse, in the EU we don't really want that).

I would favour a federated military, with each member country maintaining their own military command, but have common standards and rules that all people and equipment are bound to. So that it would be easy to move a Slovenian division to Portuguese command temporarily or a Swedish aircraft carrier to Greek command, while still have different commands to avoid abuse by a central military command.

But by that time I'll probably be too old. I'd like to see this chance for our kids however, instead of the only option being 'serving your individual country'. And I bet you, I'm not the only one who feels like this. I'd like to add though, that military service should definitely be something voluntary and not something forced on you, otherwise we won't have a truly free nation. The ones who feel the call to serve, should. For others, it's cruelty to force them into it.

For example, the rules on how your economy must be maintained. It was always going to be hard work for several different countries to maintain their economy within certain parameters of each other. Different countres have different economies. Germany is very strong on manufacturing, The UK was strong on banking. With these differences in the economies, they are going to behave differently. 

Its the same with political Union. The different countries in Europe having large differences in political feeling. 

I do agree that done right, it could be a very good thing, with the European patents, as you pointed out, as well as all the easier regulation that could be put in place (making CITES laws better thought out, for example). However, I do feel that it would have been possible to add this level of regulation to the free trade union (which worked well, AFAIK). Having Europe wide regulation on some things (equivalent to a whole collection of trade pacts, maybe?) with the free trade union, whilst leaving counties relatively completely independent to vote for or against being with the pact collection. It would probably be an all or nothing style of thing, as having a country that only agrees to some of the pacts would be silly. 

I wouldn't vote for Europe to be set up as it is now. I would vote for a different set up based on the free trade union.

Sure. But actually, when I'm arguing with some french people about “everybody should speak english”, the reply I get is “so brits come to France, and don't speak french. But when I go in UK, I have to speak English, because nobody speaks French”.

First of all, (joke inside) this false, since London is a French city now :D .

Anyway, seriously, they don't understand the issue. Having an international language is something very important. You know, I spend some time in Japan, and it was crazy, because I didn't speak Japanese, and nobody (less than in France, yes it's possible) speak English in Japan.

So IMHO, everybody speaking a common language is a big issue. It doesn't have to be English. English is almost the international *de facto*, and I know it. But if one day, someone says, “okay Esperanto is the international language”, I'll take lessons and learn it.
