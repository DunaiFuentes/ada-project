true,Perculsion,NETH,The Netherlands,"Straight from wikipedia:
'Although the directive applies to all member states, in the United Kingdom, it is possible to opt out of the 48 hour working week and work longer hours. However, it is not possible to opt out of the other requirements'

It's silly to opt out though unless the directive is more strictly translated into UK law:     
it's the *average* working week of 48 hours (article 6), measured over a *four month* period; holidays of course do not count in calculating this average (article 16).

Not even my workaholic boss would manage to top that. Neither would our PM or the CEO of Shell. In other words, this bit is totally useless except as some kind of anti-slavery law.

The directive might be an interesting read for Americans though, setting a minimum of 20 days by law (Dutch law requires 22 iirc, but 25 or 30 is more common and in the case of old contracts even 38).

By the time I left, I would say I was pretty proficient in spoken French (I can speak with most people casually about most topics, there's only the occasional word I won't get, I have no problems getting around, shopping, asking for help in shops, etc. etc.), but writing in French is still pretty tricky for me and I'm always forgetting letters. I worked really hard at speaking as much as I could and studying on my own, but didn't work as hard on writing, and it really shows, imo. I have friends who were at the same level as me when we arrived who left still speaking pretty much no French, but they had a great time in Paris still. I guess it depends on what you're here for, my French improved a lot, but I did work for it.

I was in a unique situation in Paris and both working/studying. I finished undergrad last spring and am going into a masters at the same school, my thesis advisor/mentor is doing a two-year sabbatical in Paris and guest lecturing at a uni here as well, and invited me to come along as a research assistant.

The northern plant always produces. Not so the southern plant. The problem was absenteeism. There were so many slackers taking Mondays off, game days off and pretty much any day when the weather was nice that production was hurting.

So the company brought in a new director who called out the malingerers and changed the culture there. It turns out the employees were slacking off simply because they figured no one cared.

- Do expect that others overtake you (illegally) on your right side at high speeds on motorways, if there is a junction coming up ahead of you. 

- if the motorway has three lanes, you are obligated to take the right lane, if traffic allows. Unfortunately a lot of people take the middle lane on an empty three lane motorway for miles and miles, because they feel insecure in their driving to do a lot of lane changing. That is illegal.

- my own made up general rule of thumb: The further south you go, the more cops will pay attention to enforcing traffic/parking laws. I still miss all my years in Berlin, because you could basically drive like a crazy Italian and no one would care.

It is also very important to note that when you are in the areas of former East Germany (*the more rural areas), there are a lot more people who either don't speak english or understand a little but can't converse.

To add to the driving, if you have never been to the EU you need to look up the signs they use. Most are pretty self explanatory, but you don't want to get into a situation. [Here's a good site.](http://www.gettingaroundgermany.info/zeichen.shtml)

true,leechnerd,null,null,"Hello, my name is leechnerd, and I'm a huge foodie, and I also live in Germany now.

This is what I miss:

1) **Real** Mexican food

Coming from a border state, I'm very snobby about my Mexican food. I'm not talking about the Mexican food you get at Taco Bell or Chipotle or ""Rosita's Mexican Grill."" I'm talking about Mexican food made by your friend's 80 year old *abuela* Maria who was spent her entire life in Mexico and is just visiting her grandkids and doesn't speak a single bit of English. The Mexican food that they sell in Germany (and Europe in general) **is not** Mexican food. These are all foods cooked by a German or Turkish chef, who took one look at a picture of ""Mexican"" food and said, ""I can create that!""

No, no you can't. You don't have the same ingredients. You can't go to the store and buy a pound of jalapeños, habaneros, anchos, etc. You don't have the same spices, the same flour, the same environment, etc.

You will never find real Mexican food in Germany. So actually, unless you are Mexican, or actually was taught how to cook Mexican food from said abuela, just do not try to cook Mexican food.

On the other hand, if you're not from a border state and never knew abuela then ok, the Mexican food here is probably awesome for you.

2) **Hamburgers**

There are a ton of places here that sell hamburgers, and they **all** make it completely wrong. They use frozen meat patties with god knows what in it and they completely overcook everything. Then they douse the hamburgers with five different sauces, put weird as fuck vegetables on it like **cucumbers** (???), and put a piece of American style cheese on it and call it a cheeseburger.

Do your family a favor and buy some good meat, meat that you told he butcher to hack up right there, and buy some good cheese from a cheese store, and make some buns, and grill up that sucker to medium and skip on the sauce so that everything remains juicy with meat juice.

3) **Beef Jerky**

As was mentioned, you can buy beef jerky here in petrol stations or I've even seen it in grocery markets like Rewe now with brands like Jack Links even. I don't have to tell you though that Jack Links is shitty tasting beef jerky, and yes, it's really expensive here. If you have the weight to bring beef jerky, I would order some [Big John's Beef Jerky](http://www.bigjohnsbeefjerky.com) and bring it, but since it's pure meat it's heavy and you might not have the weight to spare. That brand is my favorite and I really love the fiery hot one. But like someone also said, watch out for spicyness. From what I noticed, the typical German concept of ""spicy"" is like equivalent to ""mild"" sauce from Taco Bell. What I'm trying to say is Germans are huge pussies when it comes to spicy food.

true,Soupias,GREE,Greece,"I lived in the UK for some time as part of my studies. So just some things that come to mind:

There are rules everywhere. I am not saying that rules are bad but you just do not know if one is nice to you because it is what he is supposed to do or he just likes you. Also because you guys have to follow strict rules all day you become a completely different person during the night. I heard so many times 'let's go get pissed'. I mean the real objective is to go out and have fun and eventually you may end up drunk. Going out to get drunk is not the objective. So during the night it was a completely different thing, it was just if people wanted to exaggerate during the night as a reaction to being oppressed during the day?

Another thing that got my attention is that family ties are quite loose. I met a lot of English students that had very little communication with their families. Trying to get trhrough their studies  on their own etc. Even when they had big problems they did not want to ask for some help from home. I think it is a matter of pride? I have to say that I respect going out on your own powers as soon as possible but it is not a shame to ask for some help. That way many bad choices and mistakes can be avoided. Again, I think British people mature earlier because they leave their family's protective environment as soon as possible but that happens the hard way. Some guidance and advice are always nice for a young person. I am not a fan of the opposite as well....like being under the family's protection and become spoiled because you know that whatever happens someone will step in and fix that. But maybe somewhere in the middle.

* [ohjein's post](http://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/y0riv/studying_abroad/c5rc4qx) is very helpful.
* All KIT students get a ticket (for free) which allows you to travel with public transportation in and around Karlsruhe every day between 6PM and 5AM and at any time during the weekend / holidays. Otherwise, fare dodging is pretty safe and saves money.
* You can drink tap water and save some money.
* Try to get into a *Studentenwohnheim*, that's a simple way to meet new people.
* Consider joining a [Hochschulgruppe](http://www.usta.de/umodell/hochschulgruppen/liste), again to meet new people.
* Expect Germans to be somewhat anti-american.
* When Germans realize that you're American, they will probably try to speak to you in English. If you want to speak / be spoken to in German, tell them so.
* If you want to travel, consider using the [Mitfahrzentrale](http://www.mitfahrgelegenheit.de/). It's quick and cheap.
* Nothing will help improving your German as much as making German friends.

But to say the North is poorer than the South thanks to Thatcher, as if it would be the case otherwise, is bollocks.

It not the sole reason but it is a serious contributing factor and most certainly due to how the reforms were carried out. The mantra of Thatcherism was that when the inefficient and bloated manufacturing was removed and the unions destroyed that private investment would move in to pick up the slack. Unfortunately this did not happen fast enough leading to the famous unemployment of the 80s, the loss of the skilled workforce and the destruction of entire communities. You still do not need to travel far to find ghost towns where all industry died off in the 80's, nothing moved in to replace it and there is nothing there for people to do. That is why the blame for North/South divide is placed at Thatcher's feet. She entrenched it for at least a generation. It doesn't help her image that she was utterly without compassion whilst doing it. ",0,1344701287,null,0,1344701630,0,c5rk3zq,t3_xzspe,t1_c5rk3zq,t1_c5r7kut,null,1429611007,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Just a few years earlier they had been ordered to maintain order at all costs, up to and including martial law and firing on protesters.)?

France is not the United Kingdom. England despises the idea of a European state. France does not. This is like saying Sarkozy was a Eurosceptic because he said he wanted to dilute the Schengen Treaty. IT'S POLITICS.

I'm going to post this for you also:
---

Here is some stuff that actually matters (appointments Hollande made etc.), and not just some stuff he said for political gain.

http://www.brookings.edu/research/opinions/2012/06/26-hollande-france-vaisse

&gt;On European policy, Hollande has maximized his freedom of action. His choice to head up French diplomacy is former Prime Minister Laurent Fabius, who famously came out against the European constitutional treaty back in 2005. However, as foreign minister, Fabius will have little say over European policy and negotiations with Berlin, which will be directed from the Elysée and executed by pro-Europe figures such as Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault and Economy and Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici.

&gt;**These choices seem to confirm the personal image of Hollande as a strong believer in European integration. Hollande is known to be a disciple of Jacques Delors, the legendary head of the European Commission (1985-1995) who presided over a jump in integration with the creation of the European Common Market.** Delors was also the Minister of the Economy and Finance who crucially urged President Mitterrand to take the necessary austerity measures so that France could stay within the European Monetary System in 1983.

&gt;Hollande’s deep support of the European integration project might answer the most existential question France will have to face in the coming years. Specifically, is France ready to accept European federalism as a solution to the euro-zone crisis? Berlin will not acquiesce to increased fiscal solidarity and common debt liability unless there is accompanying progress on integrated political structures – and Merkel is ready to fight for these structures. With Hollande, France – traditionally more protective of its sovereignty – might be more likely to play ball.

And here is some more:

true,mars20,null,null,"You really should go to Bamberg and after that visit Nürnberg, and as you'll pass Bayreuth anyways, take a look there too. If you don't have much time, skip Bayreuth, but don't skip Bamberg!

**Bayreuth:** 
*[The Opara House is Unesco world heritage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margravial_Opera_House) and it's the city of Wagner (Ride of the Valkyries)
*[The Eremitage](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eremitage_%28Bayreuth%29) wiki only in german, but the pictures are what you are going to see

**Bamberg:**
Whoo, where should I begin? 
* The city itself is about 1400 years old, and also called franconian Rome, as it is built on seven hills like rome. It's *world heritage* as it was not damaged in WWII and therefore has an unique german medivial town centre. Actualle the whole old town is world heritage with over 1200 single buildings...  
*The [cathedral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamberg_Cathedral) there is a over thousand years old. There are the tombs of one Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (Heinrich II. 973 - 1024) and one Pope (Clement II. 1005-1047), which is the only tomb of a pope noth of the alps.
*Right next to the Cathedral, there is the ""Alte Hofhaltung"" where they shot a few scenes from the three muskeers
*The [Old city hall, altes Rathaus](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altes_Rathaus_%28Bamberg%29) was built IN the river, because the Bishop was forced to allow the people to build one, but did not give them land where they could), also this building can be seen in the movie ""the three musketeers""
* [Little Venice](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein-Venedig_%28Bamberg%29), mentioned above 
* [Claus von Stauffenberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claus_von_Stauffenberg) had his regiment there and his widow lived in bamberg till she passed away in 2006.
* Bierkeller which are like bavarian beergardens, I recomment you go to the Spezialbierkeller or [""Spezi Bierkeller""](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=49.884757,10.887499&amp;hl=de&amp;num=1&amp;t=h&amp;z=18)  as you'll have a superb view over Bamberg and can enjoy one of the best beers of the world ;)
If you have time, watch the sunset there, enjoy some beer and have classic franconian food. 
*Bamberg is maybe the only place in the world, where you can enjoy some [beer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoked_beer) like it was centuries ago.  I recommend the [Schlenkerla Rauchbier here](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=schlenkerla+rauchbier&amp;hl=de&amp;ll=49.891835,10.884941&amp;spn=0.004016,0.010568&amp;num=30&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=fflb&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=de&amp;hq=schlenkerla+rauchbier&amp;hnear=0x47a1f8c7d57c34a1:0x41eda32beb5c7d0,Erlangen&amp;cid=0,0,13639531393304887358&amp;t=h&amp;z=17)
If you leave the ""Schlenkerla"", turn right and enjoy the Nightlife of Bamberg
* There is also an quite large US Garrison, so you won't have problems speaking english ;)

I forgot the [Sandkerwa](http://www.sandkerwa.de/bildergalerie/) which is a beerfest / kermesse in the centre of Bamberg during 23.-27. of august. Like Oktoberfest, but smaller, cozy and with one bar/club next to each other and a huge party on the streets in front of the clubs. 

I dont know how much time you are planning to spend there, but if there is almost no time: Old city hall, and then right to the Spezikeller ;)

**Nürnberg:**
Most people know Nürnberg for its Nazi history and the trails (the court room can be visited), but it also has a great history, it became a very rich city in the medival times because the trade route to italy passed by.
* [Castle of Nürnberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Castle) : From there you have a nice view overlooking the city, and it is one of the most important castles in europe because of it's history.
* The market with its golden fountain (Schöner Brunnen) and it's Weihnachtsmarkt (only i the weeks before christmas)
* [Nazi party rally grounds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_party_rally_grounds): Well, the title tells it. Adolf Hitler built a large rally ground there and you can still see the remains and visit a museum that will give you an insight on the cruelties and his insane mind.
*Nürnberg is also home of [Albrecht Dürer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrect_Durer), one of the most important painter/mathmatican/... of medival europe
*[Germanisches Nationalmuseum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanisches_Nationalmuseum): Well the largest museum of german history &amp; culture. But i believe this would be a little bit too much ;)

Francois Hollande is known to SUPPORT further political integration Europe!

There, read this. Here is some stuff that actually matters (appointments Hollande made etc.), and not just some stuff he said for political gain.

http://www.brookings.edu/research/opinions/2012/06/26-hollande-france-vaisse

&gt;On European policy, Hollande has maximized his freedom of action. His choice to head up French diplomacy is former Prime Minister Laurent Fabius, who famously came out against the European constitutional treaty back in 2005. However, as foreign minister, Fabius will have little say over European policy and negotiations with Berlin, which will be directed from the Elysée and executed by pro-Europe figures such as Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault and Economy and Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici.

&gt;**These choices seem to confirm the personal image of Hollande as a strong believer in European integration. Hollande is known to be a disciple of Jacques Delors, the legendary head of the European Commission (1985-1995) who presided over a jump in integration with the creation of the European Common Market.** Delors was also the Minister of the Economy and Finance who crucially urged President Mitterrand to take the necessary austerity measures so that France could stay within the European Monetary System in 1983.

&gt;Hollande’s deep support of the European integration project might answer the most existential question France will have to face in the coming years. Specifically, is France ready to accept European federalism as a solution to the euro-zone crisis? Berlin will not acquiesce to increased fiscal solidarity and common debt liability unless there is accompanying progress on integrated political structures – and Merkel is ready to fight for these structures. With Hollande, France – traditionally more protective of its sovereignty – might be more likely to play ball.

And here is some more:

[28 April: Which Europe?](http://www.opendemocracy.net/philippe-marli%C3%A8re/28-april-which-europe)

&gt;the **national debate [in France] is no longer between partisans of further integration (federalists or integrationists) and advocates of further national sovereignty (intergovernmentalists or sovereignists). It opposes two conceptions of European integration**: a “leftwing” one (or Keynesian) and a “rightwing” one (or neoliberal)

While I'm not a fan of the Monarchy in principle, in practice, I think we should keep them, primarily because I haven't heard a good suggestion for what should replace them. Currently the Queen is Head of State, so if the Monarchy was removed, this leaves the Head of State position open. It could go to the Prime Minister, but personally, he has too much power within our system anyway, so I wouldn't want to give him any more. I also like the Head of State being separate from politics, the neutrality gives a more professional demeanour to the role, especially with regards to foreign dignitaries, and our Head of State isn't caught up in whatever petty party politics are happening at the time.

The second suggestion would be an elected Presidential type system, this is the worst outcome possible for me because of how it would change politics in the UK for the worse. Currently, we don't elect our leader, it's just the leader of the majority party, or in this case the leader of the largest party in a coalition that rules as Prime Minister, but already plenty of people vote based off the popularity of the party leader, as opposed to actual party policies. Having a Presidential election would turn it into a US style pissing contest which is not good for political discourse, and of course, as they would be the only leader in the country with a national mandate, they would naturally have more power than the current PM and the Commons and Lords, something I don't want to see at all.

This is also part on the reason he moved back south to Bavaria/traditional Habsburg area to reform his NSDAP, he failed in prussian territory. [Start of the NSDAP movement, another huge topic]

In todays germany prussia is a very faint momory, many things before WWII and Nazis got kinda pushed back, since the Nazi were on the most dominat pieces of history in germanys 20th century history.

Overall Prussia is mostly linked to traditionalists, a proud military and the german empire. The view is mostly neutral, since few know enough to have an opinion.

For the german Bundeswehr [the german armed forces] Prussia is a big host of traditions. Nazi-times are obviously a nogo, and the discipline and correctness of prussian military is a good example for soldiers.

You're wrong there (also in that we don't have any pure conservatives i know of) the Wallonian ""socialists"" n such often share ideas with the Flemish ones and have no hard feelings towards each other. However the ""Socialists"" are just much bigger on the french speaking side and the ""liberal/democrats"" a lot stronger on Flemish side this due to stuff like our completely split media and issues. When you see coalitions to form a government its never the big ""socialists"" with the completely like-minded ""democrats"" because that's just not possible with the people voting that differently on both sides. The current ""ruling"" coalition is one with socialists, liberals and ~~christian~~ democrats.

The biggest problems during the past struggle however was not bout political sides and opinions it was about stuff that isn't even really in the interest of the common people its about for which side of the border votes in an area where (BHV). They both had completely different ideas on that.

ps. I put socialists and whatnot all between """"'s because we have a wide array of parties with fading views or that aren't really one one side of the political cross and even our ""liberals"" would be considered commies in a country like for example the USA.

1. Current official estimates are that prices will start to rebound in 2014. Official estimates are often optimistic.

2. Even if you miss the optimal, bottom-of-the-price-curve purchase window, recoveries are usually much slower than the preceding busts. Miss the bottom by 2 years *after* the bottom? Meh. Miss the bottom by 2 years *before* the bottom? That might hurt more :-)

3. The Spanish real estate bubble was bigger than the US bubble, relative to GDP (from 15% of GDP long-term average to 22% of GDP at the height in Spain, from 4% to 6% of GDP in the US). This means that all things being equal (which they admittedly aren't), the bust should be deeper and longer in Spain than in the US.

4. My understanding is that you can't hand over the keys to the bank and walk away clean in Spain, like you can in the US. Yes, the house is your collateral, but if it sells for less than what you owe the bank, you owe the difference to the bank. This means that, relative to the US, the market in Spain will take longer adjust to the new reality, because people will be less willing to walk away. People *need* their houses to be worth what they paid.

5. The Spanish government needs the Spanish banks to survive because these banks are buying most of the Spanish government bonds these days, and if these banks go under, the likelihood that the Spanish government goes under increases. As a result, the government has a vested interested in pushing for fixes to the Spanish financial system which perpetuate the status quo, i.e. preventing banks from having to unload properties at real market prices. Thus you end up with banks like Bankia, EU plans to create ""bad banks"" in Spain that are capitalized to be able to hold out for better prices 10 years down the road, etc. Again, another reason why the market may take longer than it should to reflect reality.

So all in all, I'm personally waiting. I wouldn't be surprised if I end up buying in 2020 :-)

EDIT: One more thing to consider is that if Spain ends up dropping the Euro, the new Peseta will most likely be devalued relative to other currencies, so even if nominal prices are slow to drop, the price drop relative to other currencies might accelerate... as long as your savings aren't denominated in Drachma ;-) See the InTrade link below.

true,democritusparadise,EURO,Ireland and USA,"Personally, in principle I have no problem with (or desire for) a constitutional monarchy. I think that their greatest strength is as a non-political symbol of the nation's unity, something which ceremonial Presidents never quite get right. For example, the Irish President may give up his or her political party, but I'll never forget that before being President Mary Robinson was Labour while Mary McAleese was Fianna Fáil.

 I do have deep concerns about how monarchies operate though. For example, I find the state of the British monarchy, where the Queen unites church and state, detestable. I have no desire to see the end of the monarchy, but I view its secularisation as a matter of great importance.

I also actually have concerns about the royals themselves. I don't think it is fair that some children by virtue of birth have to live their lives in a certain way, pre-ordained before their were even born. Conversely, I also don't think it is fair that they have those rights by default. If there was a vote on either the abolition or the instatement of a monarchy, I'd usually vote for the status quo. Generally, I think there are more important issues to devote time to, and with the exception of non-secular monarchies and lack of female primogeniture, I think the current state of affairs is acceptable.

But it really is a matter for the citizens of constitutional monarchies and whatever they vote for I'll support.

It depends on which university you study at. To study at an university in Germany you need ""Abitur"". There is therefore a slight chance that your highschool degree might not be enough, especially since medicine requires a numerus clausus of ~1,9-1,0, at least at the Unis I know about.

You are also required to have some sort of certification that you are able to communicate in german, like taking some german courses.

This is just what I know about, it's best to actually contact some universities which you want to attend to (I think the University in Heidelberg is pretty good when it comes to medicine) and ask directly what they expect from you.

So einfach ist das beim Medizinstudium AFAIK nicht. Früher (bis vor 1-2 Jahren) wurden die Medizin-Studienplätze über die ZVS vergeben. Das war eine Organisation, bei der man sich für bestimmte, besonders beliebte Studiengänge (wie z.B. Medizin) beworben hat und die dann die Studienplätze vergeben hat. Die ZVS wurde von der [Stiftung für Hochschulzulassung abgelöst](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiftung_f%C3%BCr_Hochschulzulassung), die hat auf ihrer Seite auch Informationen für [ausländische Bewerber](http://www.hochschulstart.de/index.php?id=8).

Ich würde daskleinemadchen raten sich früh zu informieren, damit keine Bewerbungsfristen oder ähnliches vorbei sind, man braucht sicher auch einen Nachweis über die Sprachfähigkeiten, für den eine Prüfung gemacht werden muss (wenn daskleinemadchen so etwas noch nicht hat).

Hinweis: Wenn das Vergabesystem noch so ist wie früher, dann ist es so dass man in aller Regel einen Studienort als Wunsch angeben kann, aber in vielen Fällen dann doch irgendwo anders studiert. Zumindest war das zu ZVS-Zeiten so. Was dann  Studenten gemacht haben war dass sie den Studienplatz nach 1-2 Semestern gewechselt haben.

IMO, there is going to be some residual culture from their home country when they first arrive, but it should sort of conform with the rights and privileges which we have secured in europe. Some immigrants do not want to become part of the society they move to and this is not okay. 

I think the natural progression of a society is towards more freedoms, less religious fundamentalism and a good economy/standard of living for most residents. I think it is inevitable that most societies (probably North Africa/Turkey first) will develop a post-enlightenment, post religion society similar to what we have today in europe, but until then a lot of the immigrants coming from those countries are not necessarily suitable for immigration to our countries. People worry about muslims becoming more prominent in european society and the problems that would entail, and really I don't blame them. I feel as though for the past 200 years we have worked towards rationalism, equality for all and fundamental rights, and I don't think many europeans are willing to give those things up in the name of religion.

* Keep a notepad handy to record new words. 
* Geil now means cool and even my Oma says it. 
* The default popcorn in cinemas is sweet (süß)! They have a little bit of salty (salzig) popcorn, but it's not always freshly made and there's no 'butter.' :(
* If you're going to pirate media make damn sure you won't get caught
* Keep a €1 coin handy for shopping carts. 
* Vendors at festivals and markets also have pfand on their dishes, so don't forget to collect it when you return them. Or keep a glass as a souvenir. 
* Get a bicycle. They can be bought inexpensively at bike shops, flea markets, etc and can be resold when you leave. But don't be a jerk. Make sure you have lights and a bell on it. 
* Don't walk in the bicycle lanes. 
* Bring a huge bottle of Aspirin (or your pain killer of choice) from home. The pharmaceutical industry has a monopoly on basically all medications and a little package of 30 ibuprofen or aspirin tablets could set you back €15 vs 500 for $10 in the US (if that is where you are). 
* Keep reusable bags on hand. Many grocery stores charge for plastic bags. 
* Also try Glühwein in winter, Spargel in late spring (it's unavoidable, really), Spätzle, Mezzomix/Spezi, Apfelschorle, Holunderschorle, Wurstsalat, and all the cakes. 
* Despite what you may have heard about tipping waitstaff in Western Europe, it IS customary in Germany to round up about 10% (if it doesn't say that it's included on the menu, and of course more for good service) when telling the waiter how much money you want to pay.
* Water is not free in restaurants, free refills are a foreign concept, and excepting the fanciest restaurants you choose your own seats.

I really missed bread and rolls. I mean whole grain products or something looking like [this](http://www.marions-kochbuch.de/index/1996.htm).
Also american cheese is mainly free of taste. Maybe just take her with you so she can pick some items she might like. But guide her a little... I just remembered it took me about an hour to pick a cereal. lol. I was overwhelmed by all the possible choices ;)

If my host family would have bought Nutella I might have cried of joy. I personally love it, but not everyone does. Also I recon it costs quite much in the US.

This comes to my mind so far. Maybe I share some of my first problems, too. I was not used to being so dependent on cars. the public transportation system is usually quite good in germany. So I always had to ask to go somewhere. This really felt strange to me and I kind of felt like a burden.

The concept of going out with friends seemed different for me, too. In Germany I had a couple of friends including male friends I could hang out without any problems. My american host family did not like that at all. They automatically assumed I was going on dates or have a romantic thing going on. Took some time to figure that out :/

ahh.. closing doors. If your exchange student closes the door behind her, it doesn't necessarily mean she wants to be alone or anything like that. Where I grew up, you close the doors where ever you go. There is no deeper meaning behind that other than save energy, I guess.

In general she will not be saying 'thank you' and 'please' and 'excuse me' as many times as you might consider it to be polity. In Germany we are just not as polite or probably don't even realize the situation ;) She will get used to it.

oh.. and one more thing. show her as subtle as possible how to sleep in the american sheets. I did not realize to sleep between the sheets, since they were tucked in to tightly ... haha

&gt;Die Regel gilt auch für den Alltag. Ein höflicher Kanadier wird nicht sagen, dass ihm ein Geschenk nicht gefällt, denn das würde sich nicht gehören und könnte die Gefühle des anderen verletzten. Und das ist – um zum zentralen Punkt der Geschichte zu kommen – im Zweifelsfall wichtiger als die reine Wahrheit. Deswegen sagt man es – wenn überhaupt – verschlüsselt, und weil der andere den Code kennt, versteht er es und alles bleibt höflich. Nicht umsonst gibt es im Englischen die Begriffe little white lie und polite lie, die beide wesentlich schwächer sind als eine “Notlüge”: Es handelt sich um eine gesellschaftlich akzeptierte, mehr noch, eine gesellschaftlich vorgeschriebene Flunkerei.
&gt;
&gt;Das wirft die Frage auf, wie Briten &amp; Co. reagieren, wenn ihnen wirklich ein Geschenk gefällt. Kurz gesagt, sie flippen völlig aus. Das wollte ich schon immer haben, Liebling, schau her, was sie mir gebracht haben, schon als Kind, nein, bereits vor der Geburt wollte ich genau das haben, warte, bis es die Nachbarn sehen, vielen, vielen, vielen dank, diesen Tag werde ich mein ganzes Leben lang nicht vergessen und meine Enkelkinder werden noch davon sprechen, ich lasse es mir auf meinen Grabstein meißeln. Wenn einem als Deutscher die ganze Situation peinlich wird und man sich langsam fragt, ob man verarscht wird, ist es genau richtig.
&gt;
&gt;So anstrengend glückliche Angelsachsen für Deutsche sein können: Umgekehrt ist das Problem ernster. Ein Amerikaner, der einem Deutschen ein Geschenk macht, ist eigentlich immer enttäuscht, denn Deutsche flippen bei so etwas nie aus. In dem Codebuch eines Angelsachsen ist das normale deutsche Dankeschön aber ein Zeichen dafür, dass man das Geschenk nicht mag. Dieser Autor hat über die Jahre schon einige betrübte Landsleute trösten müssen, die mit der Klage She didn’t like my present! What did I do wrong?

Butter. It's not salty, at least in Germany. Don't go out of your way to get some unsalted butter, but at least warn her, just in case. We love (good) bread with various toppings, so ""native"" butter doesn't quite fit, at least initially. 

Bread. If it's feasible maybe get a fresh, good quality loaf of bread for the beginning. We do eat toasts and other heavily processed bread stuffs, but she may yearn for what she's used to.

Cakes. You guys have a different approach to cakes. The way you combine fluffy dough with colourful fat/cream topping really shocked me and my taste buds. Frankly, it made me retch at first. Take it slow with that stuff. A handful of chocolate chip cookies or a toned down brownie will be far more palatable.

Communicate. Ask what she wants, don't be too offended when she answers truthfully. This obviously depends on the personality of your exchange student, but the average German will speak his/her mind.
