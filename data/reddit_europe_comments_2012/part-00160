Don't you find this to be a catch-22? People don't vote for them because they've never governed because people don't vote for them. That only keeps the bigger parties big and powerful, thus dangerous.

&gt; They spout on and on about how there should never have been a bank bailout, but fail to provide practical solutions

IMHO they should let the fucking odious banks fold, rot and burn, and make their stinking usurers and shareholders cover the losses and pay their part of the debt with absolutely everything they own as necesary, or rot in jail. Meanwhile the central bank (the state) is to repay and get bailed out if necessary; private banking should be abolished.

&gt; Their ties to the paramilitary organisations they used to represent as their day job are still present

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Ditch the Euro, free-float independent currencies, and have each government issue all debt in that currency. 

Heh, its not like every country wasn't doing that in the first place. Its a workable system, sure. 

It incurs constant costs due to exchange rate uncertanties and transaction costs, traps capital, slows market integration, but its possibly a more sensible one while the EU doesn't form one optimal monetary zone. 

OTOH, creating a monetary union integrated capital markets, and is a factor in forging an optimal monetary zone (along with single market reforms etc)

Still, this doesn't follow:

&gt;Do all that and austerity is never needed.

*never needed*, c'mon

First, ofc individual countries end up having financial problems even when denominating debts in their own currency. 

And if a massive budgetary hole is patched up only by monetary means - what ends up being printing money, a) you might end up causing hyperinflation, b) your long-term borrowing expenses (if that's how you tend to act) will be higher than if you wore a credible monetary hare shirt (sp?), c) devaluating your currency as a way of lowering your debt burden still counts as a default, triggers CDSs etc, and hence you still might get yourself locked out of the markets.

But y, it is much more flexible, then being stuck with a single exchange rate. At least for largish economies - small and open economies don't necessarily profit. 

It was never for eg a good option for my country; we, like a number of others (say baltic countries) maintained (more or less) a peg to the euro even outside the eurozone. And are having a crisis. And doing (some) austerity. 

So we had the option to depreciate yet didn't, since for eg everyone's individual debts, and moreover also company debts would become worse, since the banks partially protected themselves with currency clauses, further those same banks took euro-denominated loans from abroad too. So poverty, financial market disruption, job loss. 

In a small, open economy, devaluation would have a large effect on internal inflation, since imports would become more expensive. Yet we don't have much of an export economy to profit from the more competitive export prices, even if there weren't any negative effects stated above.

So, I don't really think playing with the monetary policy is a particularly good idea - a solid and rigid one is prob better as a long term practice, cheapening borrowing, and if a single currency, integrating the markets and removing the speculative costs of transfers - though I do begrudge the ECB for being so rigid and following Germany's interests, over those of the troubled periphery, and not inflating a bit more. And given the past of many countries now in the eurozone, only an institution like the ECB could seem credible to the markets as a guardian of such a stable monetary policy.

But you know what keynes said about the long-term - ""in the long term, we're all dead"" :P



Still, and second point, neither is austerity really needed having a common currency - their other option was fairly similar in repercussions as doing anything of the above - they could default. (in fact, as eurozone stood in 2008, they had no other choice but to default, only that shock would have been much worse then Lehman collapse, would prob disintegrate the European banking sector, so EU invented various bailout mechanisms). Or do anything they want really, EXCEPT devaluation. Like say a federal state in the US can. Which is how I tend to think about various EU countries, except for a difference in degree of integration.

Now I don't think its a bad thing various chronically profligate governments or private sector booms were finally corrected, since as catastrophic as this is, it would have gotten only worse with time. But the shape of the 'recovery' policies, with which I do disagree with and is prob what is meant by austerity,  was very much shaped by the governments in power during the crisis, and parties in power in the EU institutions. 

Primarily governments though, since no institutions existed at the time of the crisis, and only governments can create and shape 'new competencies'.

What they were missing, was anything to deal with asymmetric shocks. 

And we're talking of a period of a conservative landslide across Europe. So Keynes and stimulus was quickly out of fashion, fiscal multipliers were systematically underestimated, let alone the social tensions and damage they and a depressive climate do to doing business in the countries, and the recepies for getting well again were cuts and cuts and regressive tax hikes.

I can't like it, but it kinda was our collective political will.

**German language stuff**

Think in German sounds... I know that sounds weird but you will come across words like ""normal"" and forget that they are not the english and you will say nor-mul like english speakers do, every time I have done this Germans seem very confused and I have to remember ""no-ah-mal.""

Force Germans to let you speak German to them, I suffered from huge amounts of self confidence issues so it has taken me much longer to learn than it should have, but if you aren't afraid to embarrass yourself a little they are usually very courteous just like we are when people make mistakes speaking English and remember some of them (when speaking English) are just as nervous as you are.

Lastly, they never seem to mind accents, I live up north and northerners are different to southerners but they all seem to find our accents kind... endearing? I'm not sure if thats the right word but they like it plus they like the fact you are putting in effort to learn their language, if you don't appear to be (which is what it looks like when I refuse to speak German, they think you are being rude and ignorant... I just get really shy.)

**Snow stuff**

Get a down jacket, best investment you will ever make...

Skiing is easier to learn harder to master... if you have 1 season and you aren't sure if you are going to do it again don't learn to ski, you will be stuck on the easy and intermediate runs the whole time.

Snowboard harder to learn (seriously dude I was 2-3 when I learnt to ski so I don't remember, however I do remember learning to snowboard and for lack of a better word it was a cunt.) easier to master. I decided to learn how to snowboard 2 winters ago, by the end of the first winter I was doing most advance stuff on the mountain by the end of the second winter I was doing backcountry stuff and I found other than understanding how edges work, there was almost NO SKILL TRANSFERENCE so my knowledge of skiing did not help at all, my knowledge with ski-teching helped me more.

true,TheMania,null,null,"&gt; First, ofc individual countries end up having financial problems even when denominating debts in their own currency.

With free-floating currencies, when has this happened?

I just cannot see how it can occur, and I cannot find a place in history where it has.

&gt; And if a massive budgetary hole is patched up only by monetary means - what ends up being printing money

Today, the US and Japanese central banks have bought so many bonds that they're now trading at their face value. A $1000 bond is extremely liquid and can be converted to $1000 virtually on request. We may as well trade bonds in supermarkets like cash, after all, they're guaranteed by the currency issuer.

Tell me. What is the difference between printing money, and selling extremely liquid bonds that trade at their face value and can be converted for cash in a whiff to cover ones spending?

That said, I don't believe printing money to be necessary. A currency issuer that is assumed by investors to print before defaulting will never have an issue finding buyers of its bonds.

&gt; It was never for eg a good option for my country; we, like a number of others (say baltic countries) maintained (more or less) a peg to the euro even outside the eurozone. And are having a crisis. And doing (some) austerity. 

If you're going to peg your exchange rate to gold, another currency, or anything else - you're going to run into problems. Very dangerous game to play. Ignoring the prospect of government default for a moment - it means you can run into crisises of insufficient money in circulation for everyone to have a job, with nothing anyone can do about it.

Granted, free-floating is costly for small economies. Still, unless you can form a proper fiscal union with other nations - with the currency-issuer actively spending in the currency you share (ie US/states of US, AU/states of AU) - it's the preferable option.

And then, is it *really* that costly? If you can maintain a peg, you're more than capable of keeping a free-floating currency stable, making trade easier.

&gt; Like say a federal state in the US can. Which is how I tend to think about various EU countries, except for a difference in degree of integration.

The degree of integration is unfortunately everything. The US federal government is capable of running long-term deficits, being the currency issuer. This allows for the non-government to save in their currency - vital, as as a reserve currency foreigners desire to hold huge quantities of it. If the US federal government was not running deficits, it'd have to be the private sector running a deficit for the foreign sector to achieve these savings.

The problem the Euro has is if people ever decide to save in it, if zero interest rates aren't a sufficient incentive to dissave, you're going to end up with a debt crisis. First world hiccup and the system more or less collapses. If the PIIGS weren't here, it'd just have been other nations struggling.

To see how, consider this. The government and non-government covers the entire economy, by definition. Every year that the government runs a deficit, the non-government is running a surplus - collecting savings. Every year that the government runs a surplus, the non-government is running a deficit.

Now throughout the GFC, private sectors across the world desired to save.

Currency-issuing governments simply ran large deficits, allowing them to.

Non-currency issuing governments had to either a) find a way to stop them saving via taxes, b) export to other countries using the same currency to accumulate savings, putting them further into debt (Germany), or c) run into a debt crisis (PIIGS).

The system's fundamentally flawed. It needs fixing, and at that, there's only two ways out. 1) Ditch the Euro, free float currencies. or 2) Give the currency issuer, the ECB, a means to put money into the economy that does not require the non-government to take on debt.

From a bunch of countries close to europe. Think of it...the USA only has borders with Mexico and Canada.  You get a bunch of illegal aliens to the USA because of Mexico. Same thing in Europe. You get a bunch of immigrants from countries like Pakistan, Algeria, Turkey, Morocco, etc, and the fact that all they have to do is land in Greece or make it to Bulgaria from Turkey, makes it a lot easier to come to europe from these countries, than going to Canada/USA. And once turkey joins the EU, gave over.

On top of it, dumbass europeans give welfare to all these immigrants and then these immigrants have 3, 4 babies per couple, and if you go to a country like France, Belgium, England, then you have unmarried men sending for wives from these countries (Algeria, Pakistan, etc) so then they bring the whole family to europe, and these people have no interest in assimilating to the culture.

And yes, just like Americans, Europeans have been brainwashed that if they criticize these people, then you're a racist.  Political correctness has gone overboard and that's why europeans are easily pushed over. They are just afraid to express their opinions in public and are brainwashed in school that multiculturalism is good and if you speak against it, then you're a racist.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"European countries can't pursue aggressive economic policies and strategies thanks to the European Union. What the union has done with common regulation has been to remove unhealthy competition from Europe. For example countries can't anymore...

* Subsidize companies and industries to allow them to make losses and take over market share. (Solar and mobile industries in China)
* Dictate homegrown standards that benefit local companies and shield them from foreign competition (Case of TD-SCDMA in China)
* Protect local producers with import duties and preventing external companies to take part in public bidding (Again China)

Germany hasn't been guilty on any of these policies. What has happened in Germany is that wages have either stagnated or decreased, but this has happened largely because value created by workers hasn't increased, and because workers in eastern Europe and China can do the same work with much lower compensation. If German wages wouldn't have stagnated or gone down, production would have moved, and now instead of talking about trade in balances in Europe, we would be speaking about massive trade in balance between Europe and China.

*Young Woman* What the fuck are you doing
*Drunk Guy*: What the fuck are you doing? Are you pushing a chick?

The first guy Almqvist is talking to is a well known Swedish comedian of Kurdish-Swedish heritage:

*Almqvist*: Don't fuck with the swedes

*Almqvist*: Kanake-lover

*Almqvist*: Don't bother with this little whore. Don't bother with her.

Worth noting is also that Erik Almqvist earlier tried to push for a motion that fought the use of the word ""Whore"", since he considered it to be ""Anti-Swedish"".

More extensive footage of them saying things like:

""With our politics, there will be no more of these guys""

""You are a Anti-swedish""

""You and your anti-swedish friend will get a lot of problems in the future""

""You debate like a little cunt""

""You are acting like a kanake right now and you have no right to be here. This is my country.""

""No it's not your country. It's my country""

A nice thing about having your own currency - a rogue government just jacks up inflation, or, with an inflation-targeting central bank, interest rates.

I shudder to think how much the 40%+ youth unemployment is going to cost Greece's productivity going into the future.

Even then, I find it hard to blame the PIIGS governments. Consider this. Money has to come from somewhere - if the private sector wants to accrue savings in Euros, say due to a worldwide financial crisis, it can only come from other nations with Euros or the government sector.

That is, the only two ways the private sector can save in Euros are: a) run a trade surplus in Euros or b) put their government into debt. They're the only two ways that the private sector can save in Euros.

Importantly, the first is not a trick that every country can do - as you need another country to run a trade deficit for you to run a trade surplus. It may work for a few nations with strong export sectors, ie Germany, but it cannot work for all of them. This, to me, is the largest flaw of the Euro.

The model that's been demonstrated to be an utter failure is a bunch of independent governments in charge of their own unemployment and a single independent central bank.

It's also so easy to see why the latter's a failure that it's so annoying that so few get it (and was known [going in](http://www.lrb.co.uk/v14/n19/wynne-godley/maastricht-and-all-that), back in 1992!). It can be summed up in three sentences:

The only way householders can save is if the country runs either a trade surplus (acquiring Euros from neighbours) or run a government deficit (acquiring Euro bonds and/or Euros from the government). Not every country can run a trade surplus, as they must be met by another country running a trade deficit. Therefore, the nations with the weakest export sectors **must** either accrue government debt, or deny their householders their desired savings - something that *always* results in raising unemployment.

Presentator: Gay-bashing has become a well-known word in the last years. People get yelled at on the street, hit or in the worst case killed because they are different. Are this exceptions or is it daily business? Guy 1, gay, and Guy 2, also gay (sorry I didn't catch the names...) have gone on the street, holding hands.

Voice over: We go on the streets, the camera was just turned on and we get the first reactions

Guy 1: There are bad looks. Well  
Guy 1: Ugly looks. A Belgian man  
Guy 1: Oh my... The looks don't get nicer  
Guy 1: There are many looks, but not much is said  

Girl: Oh my god, I see faggots (TN: I don't know the word flikkers, but from context this is probably what she meant)  

Girl: Fag  

Guy on the street: What a view, what a view. Tell me, who fucks whom first?

Guy o t s 2: Get lost! Bye boys

Guy o t s 3: A pussy is way better  
Guy 2 (answering): We have different opinion  
Guy 2 to Guy 1, laughing: A pussy is way better \*laugh*  

Guy 1: Have you seen his face?  
Girl from far away: Gays!

Guy o t s: Stop holding hands
Guy 2: Why?

Guy 1: I really wanted to say something back, but it was over to fast

Guy o t s: There are kids in this neighborhood!

Guy o t s: That's disgusting, that's disgusting

Guy o t s: There are hotels here too!  
Guy 1: Why? Why is it disgusting?  
Guy o t s: I'm against it  

Guy o t s: That's gross  
Guy 1: What's gross about it?  
Guy o t s 2: He thinks that's gross.  
Guy 1: Yeah, but why?  
Guy o t s 2: I also think that it's gross.

Guy o t s 2: Because you ass-fuck    
Guy o t s 3: Everyone can do what he wants  
Guy 1: That's true. But it looks like you have to convince your friend  

Guy 2: There are always people who correct the statements of their groups

Boy on the street: What is it?  
Guy 1: You said ""pussy"", right?   
Boy o t s: But you are, right?    
Guy 2: No, we're gay  
\*laugh*  
Boy o t s: Does it hurt?  
Guy 2: What?
Boy o t s: A dick in the ass  
\*laughing*  
Guy 1: You already know a lot about it  
Boy 2: Do you have an Euro?  
Guy 1: No, I don't have an Euro  
Boy 3: If he asks you about an Euro you have to give it to him.  
Guy 1 + 2: No, we don't have to  
Boy 3: Two punches, you're at the ground  
Boy 4: Give money  
Guy 1: No  

Guy 1: These are the converstations where you get happy from...

Voice over: Insults, curses and also threats. We continue our journey, but a boy is following us. 

Boy: Don't you have an Euro?  
Guy 1: No, we really don't have one  
Boy: I asked once  
Guy 2: No, for the 7th time  
Boy: The third time I'm going to destroy you  
Guy 1: Come, we go  
Guy 2: They follow us  
Guy 1: Can they do anything?   
Guy 2: I think so  
Guy 1: Let's go! Come!  
Guy 1 (silently): Fuck off boys

Je suis actuellement apprenti boulanger, j'espère que mon statut conviendra à votre étude.

Je suis un homme, de 21 ans, et apprenti boulanger (stage en un an à l'INBP (Institut National de la Boulangerie et Pâtisserie)).


Notre formation couvre l’intégralité des tâches liées à la boulangerie française, de la sélection des ingrédients à la gestion de l'entreprise.


La section comprends sensiblement plus d'apprentis que d'apprenties, schéma qui semble aussi valable parmi les professionnels.


Le genre du boulanger ne semble pas être une question pour les clients, mais j’admets n'avoir qu'une vision limitée sur ce point.


Dans le passé, les professions alimentaires étaient réputées très machistes, et c'est toujours le cas même si les contre-exemples se multiplient. Les mentalités et la culture ont aussi évoluées, ce qui peut jouer.


Gardons à l'esprit que quand au statut des femmes, la France n'est sans doute pas aussi mal lotie que d'autres pays (US, certains pays méditerranéens...). Les stéréotypes ont la même origine que partout, i.e les modèles sociaux pré-années soixante.


Si l'envie vous prenait de passer un coup de fil à l'INBP, je suis sûr qu'ils seraient heureux de répondre à vos question concernant le milieux de la boulangerie-pâtisserie! Vous trouverez leurs coordonnées sur [leur site](http://www.inbp.com/).

true,will_holmes,UKGB,United Kingdom,"That's not how it works. Austerity does reduce growth, but it also reduces the deficit (which is happening quite quickly for Portugal) which in turn eventually reduces debt. 

The debt isn't infinite, as soon as it's at managable levels then you can stop being austere and get the economy growing again.

Obviously, there's a balance for the depth of the cuts, and it's different for each country depending on infrastructure, social aspects and pre-existing debt/deficit (and some other factors). There exists an equilibrium point where the deficit reduction is at a maximum and minimises the length of the period of austerity.

Less austerity than this point would mean that the deficit doesn't reduce as quickly, the banks become less confident, and the short term extra economic growth and tax revenue wouldn't compensate for it. More austerity would mean that the reduced economic growth and reduced tax revenue would overcome the short term reduction in the deficit.

The idea that the depth of the cuts being a political issue is farcical. It's a mathematical calculation, opinion doesn't really come into it.

Where the opinion does come in is how efficiently the government can run the country on a restricted budget, which is a question of competence.

The more I think about it. How FUCKING STUPID/SPOILED do you have to be to start/sign a petition b/c of the price of the cheeseburger. Do those ppl really eat 10 cheeseburgers a week to really make a significant impact on their lifes? 

If they suddenly decided to raise the price of rice in some southeast Asia countries I could understand the outcry, b/c then it really is a matter of life and death. 
But the price of A FUCKING BURGER? Just dont eat that shit then. You will be hungry again 30 minutes after a McDonalds burger anyway. It has never been worth the amount they charge for it. 

I am not even a vegan Fastfood basher. In fact I just had a Chili Cheese Sandwich at Burger King on my way home from the airport in Frankfurt today.

That's just not true, you do know how interest rates and exponential functions work, right? It's perfectly possible for a debt to reach a level where it will grow infinitely and there's nothing you can do about it, arguably Portugal is very close to that position.   
  
The rest of your post is the same thing that has been repeated over and over by austerity proponents, austerity does not restore confidence, what restores confidence is growth. No one cares how much your debt is as long as you grow and the interest rates are low.  
  
What takes confidence away from investors is deflation, recession and ever lowering demand, which is what we have now.

I do agree Portugal is doing a reasonable job implementing austerity, the problem is that it's making things worse, our debt to GDP is only getting worse and worse and progressively more unsustainable.

You should give your country a bit more credit.

Lots of things restore confidence, and lots of things destroy it, but the primary thing is long term growth without a default. One of the tragedies of the economic debate is that it's polarised people into ""pro-austerity"" and ""anti-austerity"", when the truth is the best strategy for every country with any chance of not defaulting is always between the two. This has come about mainly by opposition parties making populist and partisan promises that they dare not enact once in power.

No one cares how much your debt is as long as you demonstrate you can eventually pay it off with your current policies.

Don't you see nothing wrong with your country receiving a huge influx of immigrants? Don't you feel your culture and ethnicity may find itself weakened in the future due to the increasing power that these minorities have? Do you honestly believe that your progressive society can coexist with Islam? And are you ok with your government telling you to work until 75 while it spends countless resources on immigrants?

And what goddamn sense does it make to place a black woman in an ad about ""genuine Swedish midsummer""???

&gt;2: The No Him-Her article is completely unrelated to anything that have to do with immigration. What, did you run out of shit to throw, so now you're just grabbing anything you find?

That's just to show how going full progressive is no different than going full retard. Progressive ideology is behind your moronic immigration policies, specifically the belief in the tabula rasa theory.

&gt;But Is it not funny how Sweden, despite our immigrants that you so blindly hate, ***still*** have a much better economy than your country? 

Give it a few more decades and then we'll talk. Portugal has mainly a political/economical problem but in terms of human capital we're fine and you only need to see how well we do outside our country to realize that.

It is. In numerous ways too many to count. Don't get me wrong, we are certainly not oppressed under the evil boot of the UK like some would believe.

Scotland shares many statistics in health, crime and drug use with many poorer countries. We want to fix the problem but can't because our budget is controlled by the UK. 

Scotland whether you agree or not, is more left leaning, but is controlled by a right leaning governing body. 

Scotland is constantly being told it's a 'subsidy junkie' by our fellow 'united' citizens in other parts of the UK. It's an insult and I'd vote independence for this one alone.

&gt;but why is Scotland thinking about leaving now?

You know who your friends are in tough times. In recent times, things have been tough and cuts have been made, which is good. However, Scotland has received a disproportionately high level of cuts from London and the south-east of England as always, is dong just fine. 

Also, the insults about the so called 'Scottish Banks' have given rise to a great deal of disrespect and vitriol going north from the 'English' taxpayer. 

&gt;I think Scotland leaving would massively skew the balance of the UK elections, with the Tories having a stranglehold on England

Not true. Only one election in the last 100 years have had the scottish vote as a deal breaker. This is a common myth and in the UK, the Scottish vote doesn't count for anything, democratic imbalance.

Austerity simply means to live within our means, if some welfare needs to be cut, then that welfare isn't something we should have had in the first place, it must be cut now before the debt associated to it does any more damage. It's obvious not popular specially among the people that benefit more from state funding but it's simply unsustainable for us to keep living the good life without money to afford it and leave the debt for future generations.

In our case, in January 2002, Portugal had a debt to GDP ratio of 51.2%, this January, it was of 108.1%. This is the main problem, this is what's driving the interest rates up and requiring us to cut down on the spending, this is why austerity is required, because it's masochistic to continue to allow the debt to grow even larger and because it's this runaway spending that's now dropping the average life quality and that will drop the average life quality even more on the long run.",0,1353012777,null,0,false,0,c71xkz5,t3_138j3s,t1_c71xkz5,t1_c71x5qq,null,1430415745,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

(2)	they can only give priority to equally qualified female candidates over male candidates:  
they must not give automatic and unconditional priority to equally qualified candidates, but must include a ""saving clause""   
which includes the possibility of granting exceptions in justified cases which take the individual situation into account, in   particular the personal situation of each candidate.

This whole crisis could have been nipped in the bud if only the ECB had very slightly inflated the Euro in 2009, when the whole situation was a small increase in the cost of lending for Greece and Potugal IIRC. Considering the total amount of Euros in circulation, the amount of new currency needed to bring the debt of these countries back to a manageable height was negligible. The resultant inflation would be almost imperceptible in the core EZ countries, but the amount of economic and political damage averted would be enormous. For some reason, that was deemed to be unfair to the EZ core, while paying for massive ineffective bailouts wasn't. I still can't see the logic in that. It's not like the EZ is in any realistic danger of an inflationary spiral anyway, with a rate of inflation in the 2.5 to 2.7% range.

1) How much does it cost you to live? - you have to give them a copy of your rental contract so they can see how much your cost of living is
2) Do you have health insurance? - you will need to get private insurance, cost varies but I pay around 215 eur a month
3) Are you making enough to cover 1) and 2)? - I brought several letters from language schools offering me freelance work. If the school wants you, then this shouldn't be a problem since the letters aren't really binding
4) Are you taking a job away from an EU citizen? - as a native American speaker teaching English, definitely not. I'm not 100% sure that this is really a criteria or not, since I never had any problems getting my first visa (you get a 1-year at first and then 2-year, etc)

What you need to do is finish your certification (not technically ""required"" for teaching adults, but will be really hard to find teaching work without it) and then hit the road and visit as many language schools as you can and try to get a stack of letters offering work. 

As a freelance teacher, you will probably have to work for multiple schools and you will almost certainly live barely above subsistence, but you just need to earn enough to pay your necessary bills.

true,canard_glasgow,SCOT,Scotland,"&gt;but why is Scotland thinking about leaving now?

Westminster is not a good political institution. MP's being elected by FPTP means that we can get a majority government in Westminster that has very little Scottish representation. It also causes the parties to adjust their policies to center around the swing constituencies, which are considerably removed from popular opinion in Scotland. There is clearly an ideological divide between Scotland and England (and I wouldn't say it was left/right, more that Scotland has rejected Thatcherism) and Westminster is not flexible enough to allow this. 

The solution to this was supposed to be devolution, it was implemented in the late 90's and is very popular. It has worked very well for Scotland and there is a great deal of support in the polls for devolution to continue. However, unfortunately Westminster is unwilling to cede any real power, particularly relating to taxation. This means we have a government in Scotland with spending powers, but no real say over its budget. The problem of the Scottish government delivering what people want with the budget and taxation set by an ideologically different UK Government is challenging and the situation is less than ideal. It reduces the effectiveness of the Scottish Government to help encourage growth in areas where the economy is struggling. It is also difficult to see how this could be resolved and how devolution could continue without England getting involved (issues like the West Lothian Question and Scottish representation in Westminster would become a lot more important) and there seems to be little political will in England to make this an option.

All that combined with the fact that various intergovernmental European organisations exist in a relatively peaceful time mean Scottish independence is something worth considering. ",0,1353020574,null,0,1353020768,0,c71zwix,t3_137q5c,t1_c71zwix,t1_c71p9dd,null,1430416839,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

- Some countries got in trouble because BANKS were betting against them. In addition those countries had a weak financial standing. Some of them are facing other internal issues, some of them have a huge unemployment rate, too.
- Our goverment saw the problem, discussing what to do there (let them go broke or help them under restriction or help them all out with no restrictions) we went for the restriction and gave some not-so-small guarantees (which is virtually money). Since we are a real democracy a lot of people can shout out things loud. Please stay on the decisions germany has taken.
- In the meantime germany did not go broke, BUT, we don't have a boosting economy eather. No one has these days. Economy is holding its level almost, because the german households are spending more savings.
- Other countries in europe are really depressed now, have to save, cut and layoff. And of course and I wish it wouldn't be this way.

why german is the one to blame ]

Transporte: Die Polizei muss die Castransporte nicht wegen der Demonstranten absichern, sondern weil Atommüll nun mal ein zu hohes Risiko birgt. Handelte es sich um den Transport irgendeines speziellen Bauteils wäre der notwendige Aufwand wesentlich geringer.

Rückbau: Es ist schon unglaublich nett von den AKW-Betreibern, den Rückbau bis zur Grünen Wiese durchzuführen, nicht? Hat auch gar nichts damit zu tun, dass jeder Kubikmeter Baumasse mehr oder weniger verstrahlt ist und daher als Sondermüll entsorgt werden muss. Um gar nicht davon  zu sprechen, ihn stehen zu lassen wie Tchernobyl etwa. Einfach n Deckel drauf und hoffen, dass keine Katastrophe passiert.
Endlager: Zum einen spielt die Größe durchaus eine Rolle, da sie die möglichen Realisierungsorte und den damit zu treibenden Aufwand durchaus beeinflusst. Je Größer das Lager sein soll, um so schwieriger und komplizierter ist es, einen geeigneten Standort zu finden. Zudem fehlt mir in deiner Argumentation noch etwas.... wieso brauchen wir nochmal in Deutschland ein neues Endlager? Ach so, wir haben mehr als ein Endlager? Vier? Na sowas. Und die Kosten für die alle trägt der Staat. Die aktuell drei in Betrieb befindlichen Forschungsreaktoren produzieren zusammen weniger Müll als ein einzelnes AKW.

Rückstellungen: Auch hier fehlt mir ein Kontra zu meinem Kritikpunkt. Nicht EON, sondern die AKW-Tochterfirmen haben das Rücklagenkonto, das kräftig steuerfrei befüllt und dann irgendwo investiert wird - an sich schon sehr dreist. Ab 2022 muss EON nicht mehr dafür geradestehen, wenn die AKW-Tochter bankrott geht und in diesem überaus netten Rücklagentopf kein Geld mehr ist, da es zuvor in ein neues AKW investiert wurde (ähnlich wie du kenn ich mich zwar mit derartigen Finanztransaktionen nicht detailliert aus, uns wird aber beiden klar sein, dass es Mittel und Wege gibt, das Geld so zu veranlagen, dass es nicht zur Finanzierung des Rückbaus herangezogen werden kann).",0,1353024606,null,0,false,0,c7210c2,t3_12t4a7,t1_c7210c2,t1_c70t07l,null,1430417360,1,false,de,t5_22i0,1

The person best suited for the job should get it - this is meant to prevent women being discriminated against.    

In the thread I linked to studies on how this has worked out in countries that have implemented this, you might find the findings interesting.

It ought to make any capitalist happy to know that gender equality is good for the economy.

""A growing number of studies suggest there may be a link between gender balanced boards and financial performance. 
companies with more women on their boards were found to outperform their rivals with a 42% higher return in sales, 66% higher return on invested capital and 53 % higher return on equity. The World Bank also finds that eliminating discrimination against female workers and managers could significantly increase productivity per worker by 25 to 40%.""

true,will_holmes,UKGB,United Kingdom,"radaway and I covered this situation in our fruitful discussion. This has happened in Greece, where the deficit increases forever no matter what level of austerity you impose. There's no equilibrium point and the economy is unstable without a default or being bailed out by massive sums of money from outside. There's probably a proper term for this, but you could think of it as a ""Deficit Event Horizon"".

However, this is not a situation that applies to the Portuguese economy, or any non-Greek European economy, and barring the possibility of something unexpected going tits up, it never will. 

No other European country has crossed that horizon (those that were on that trajectory have been deflected by bailouts) and it is possible for each one of them to sort themselves out by budgeting to the right level. Unless you've crossed the horizon, being religiously anti-austerity like many of these protesters is naïve.

Similarly, being blindly pro-austerity in reaction is equally naïve. It's not a binary thing, you have to work out how much austerity you need for each country and then budget to the best of your ability from there.

I just find this whole pro- vs. anti- argument tiresome. No government who wants to get elected in their next term would do anything but more or less what they're already doing, again barring Greece who has a different choice to make. Likewise, no primary opposition party regardless of ideology stands anything to lose by constructing this false dichotomy to the voters.

Don't smoke that shit. Do weed insteadif you must do cannabis. It's not 100% free of contaminants but it's much better than hashish. Unfortunately, hashish is what most cannabis users smoke in Europe. If cannabis were legal, hashish would have to have some serious quality control.

In theory, yes, but for norway this could change in time. Both Switzerland and Norway are kind of tied to the euro, considering both countries are both large in export. There are two import differences tough.

Switzerland has tied the franc to the euro, making import for EU countries costly stable, while Norway is just getting richer and richer. While we are still strong in both exporting oil, fish and energy, Norway and our kroners just keep growing. It's becoming a problem. The more expensive we get, the fewer countries will import from us. Not to forget that we keep hiking taxes on import (recent example is the tripling of import taxes on solid cheese to stimulate and protect our national market and farmers). A lot of the crisis countries have dropped their import drastically. We're sitting on a mountain of cash, and we will still be filthy rich for a long while. But if keep this up we're distancing ourselves from an international market, this can in the long run hurt our economy.

That's the narrative, however, there's absolutely no guarantees that austerity will reduce corruption. In fact it can backfire horribly and actually increase it as bureaucrats, policemen and other underpaid state officials become ever more susceptible to bribes and make them a consistent supplement of their monthly income. This creates a culture of corruption in the general population that has to deal with them.   
  
The damage can be long lasting too, in Portugal you now have the first generations of working age people, where almost all of them have never bribed anyone and for whom doing so is inconceivable. The prolonging of this austerity may completely ruin that and make bribing and corruption a daily part of our lives again.

Hier sind ein paar Benchmarks, kannste dir ja mal angucken.

Wie gesagt, sonderlich toll ist das nicht, aber ich bezweifle, dass man für das Geld mehr Leistung bekommen kann. Wenn möglich würd ich zur HD 7750 oder HD 7770 greifen, schau mal nach ob du das mit deinem Geldbeutel vereinen kannst. Vllt. kannst du bei der Festplatte auch etwas sparen, wenn du nicht so viel Speicherplatz brauchst.

Zur Frage, warum ich gerade diese Sachen genommen hab:

Gehäuse und Netzteil: So ziemlich das günstigste, ohne totalen Müll zu kaufen. Gerade beim Netzteil ist es wichtig, nicht zu sehr zu sparen, weil richtig schlechte Netzteile wenn man Pech hat schonmal die ganze restliche Hardware mit in den Tod nehmen können, wenn sie frühzeitig den Geist aufgeben. Das Cougar ist aber zuverlässig.

RAM: Hier ist die Marke eigentlich egal, 4GB sind für nen halbwegs modernen PC eigentlich das Minimum, mehr braucht man aber auch nicht unbedingt. Kaum ein Spiel kann mehr als 4 überhaupt ausnutzen. Also einfach irgendein günstiges 2x2GB Kit.

CPU: Ist relativ günstig und reicht trotzdem für die meisten Spiele. Intel ist für Spieler derzeit in fast allen Preisbereichen eine bessere Wahl als AMD. Das liegt v.a. im Budget-Bereich daran, dass AMD auf mehr Kerne setzt, während die günstigen Intels nur 2, dafür aber schnellere Kerne haben. Viele Spiele profitieren nur geringfügig von mehr als 2 Kernen. Solange die Grafikkarte nicht limitiert, könntest du mit diesem Prozessor so ziemlich alles mit akzeptabler Framerate spielen.

Mainboard: Dieses Modell wurde in nem anderen Forum mal empfohlen für nen Build in dem Preisbereich und generell macht ASrock gute Mainboards zu vernünftigen Preisen.

Grafikkarte: Einfach geguckt, was noch ins Budget passt und dann was vernünftiges ausgewählt. Der Kühler ist gut (und v.a. relativ leise), deswegen hab ich das Modell von Gigabyte genommen.

HDD: WD ist zuverlässig, die Caviar Blue ist recht flott und auch leise. Hab selber das 750GB Modell davon und bin super zufrieden.",0,1353062967,null,0,false,0,c728niw,t3_13ajcn,t1_c728niw,t1_c728ini,null,1430421184,4,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,4

true,cheio,ANAR,Zensiert,"&gt;dass das Wort ""Neger"" ohne Kontext erst einmal eine Beleidigung ist

Daraufhin habe ich mir mal Zeit genommen, und einen Freund aus Kamerun gefragt, wie er das empfindet. Das ergab einen langen Monolog, den ich hier so kurz wie möglich zusammenfasse:

Er empfindet den Begriff ohne Kontext nicht als Beleidigung. Er fällt ihm überhaupt erst auf, wenn er auch auffallend verwendet wird, also in auffallendem Zusammenhang, auffallend oft und auffallend unnötig. Beispiel: Einer seiner Nachbarn benutzt dieses Wort immer, obwohl er die Namen der Betroffenen nennen könnte. Unabhängig davon begrüßen sich seine Freunde auch mal mit „Hey, Neger“. In seinem Freundeskreis gehen — kaum verwunderlich — auch politisch unkorrekte Worte für Weiße um, die zu verwenden sie nicht gerade zimperlich sind. Eines davon ist „Gambas“. Es gibt wohl noch wesentlich häßlichere, die er mir aber nicht verraten hat (Körpersprache habe ich als Verschämtheit gedeutet, nicht als Bosheit).

&gt; historischen Dimension
Ich denke, damit spielst du, weil es um die deutsche Sprache geht, darauf an, daß die Begriffe „Neger“ und ähnliche in der NS-Zeit qualifizierte Beleidigungen waren. Das ist richtig, es gibt dabei aber zwei Haken:

1. Die historischen Dimensionen reichen weiter zurück als bis zur NS-Zeit. Ursprünglich geht „Neger“ auf das Lateinische zurück, „Mohr“ aufs Altgriechische, etc und mehr als die Hautfarbe wird damit nicht beschrieben. Erst viel später haben unsägliche Rassentheorien diese Begriffe überhaupt als Beleidigung ermöglicht. Das Problem ist eben nicht der Begriff selbst, sondern der Rassismus.

2. Auch „Jude“ war in der NS-Zeit eine qualifizierte Beleidigung.

Conclusio: Ich halte „Neger“ für erstmal keine Beleidigung, kann aber nachvollziehen, warum du das anders siehst. Ich umfahre diesen Begriff im Alltag auch (außer in Diskussionen über den Begriff selbst, dann muß ich ihn natürlich benutzen ;)), wenn es geht, weil eben Leute damit Probleme haben, auch wenn das eben hauptsächlich Weiße sind.

&gt; Ich denke, wir können uns einfach drauf einigen, dass der Lehrer in einem gewissen Maße ignorant ist
&gt; ungeschickt
&gt; Schülerin vollkommen verstehen

Durchaus, ja. Ich könnte in dem Fall sogar noch einen Schritt weiter gehen, der Kontext gibt ja einiges her.

&gt; Holocaustleugnung, sondern um -relativierung

Das reicht meiner Meinung nach. Es wäre ne neue Diskussion, wie man an den Holocaust rangeht und ihn in andere historische Verbrechen einordnet. Ich finde es völlig OK, wenn man da Meinungen abseits des Mainstream vertritt, aber der Gefahr, dadurch in die braune Ecke gedrängt zu werden, darf man sich als Lehrer ruhig bewußt sein.

The US has a stream of (relatively) educated and wealthy people willing to immigrate there every year, Europe has less of these. Europe is treating immigration as a humanitarian gesture, the US is treating it as a source of labor.

Sweden accepted more refugees from Iraq after the war than the US did, for crying out loud - Sweden! A country of 9 million people that didn't even take part in that stupid war.

Of course we get ghettos when people arrive here mostly not speaking the language (the English-speaking countries in Europe have an advantage though) and many of them with no education, or at least none that is considered valid by our employers.

Importing is also cheaper in most cases, plus you don't have to worry about stupid censorship, like region locked multiplayer. Also don't trust publishers when they say a game is uncut in germany.

The best source for censorship information can be found here (site is in german): http://schnittberichte.com/

As for playing your current games, it's a bit of a gamble. Most Xbox games have no region lock. They can be played on NTSC and PAL systems. But some publishers are massive cunts and do region lock their games to make importing games harder. Unfortunately the only way to find out is google or testing it yourself.

For even more fun keep in mind that they (ship owners) have been outsourcing to Chinese shipyards way before the crisis. I know that because a friend of mine is a naval engineer and he used to travel to China a lot for oversight of reparation works. The reason to do so is of course that the price per kilo (repairs are mostly billed by the kg) is about one third compared to the one found in Greece. But so is the craftsmanship. So when a relatively new ship is in need of repairs, Greek shipyards are preferred. On older ships China is the choice.

It's worth taking a note that Greek shipyard laborers (mostly metal workers) are considered world class. Their wages are also reflecting that but within the confines of Greece (eg they would not be considered highly paid in a more prosperous country).

All in all for the ship owners the bottom price is that counts. And that was before 2008. His point is moot. They have been outsourcing those jobs for years now.

I do not blame them of course for doing so. I mean, I do not feel too good about it (or at all), but they are running a bushiness after all. Then again I do not considered them as Greek citizens either.

Yet it starts with a picture of Versaille's palais des glaces and the article is illustrated with a picture of that room. In no way does this represent any sort of reality with today's France.

Now lets look at some of the facts that are thrown in there :

* In the second paragraph, the writer seems to assume that liberal capitalism is the only possible way to be. ""the rich are routinely abused"", wat? The rich are rich, the poor are poor. There is a lot of abuse whoever you are. Not being rich, I can only assume: but I think the rich have it better than so many people I know in France that can barely make it at the end of each month. And I'm not even talking about my family in the countryside that can't make it and have to crash at some relative's.

* 3rd paragraph. ""more positive side to the country"". I'm not even going to go into the fact that the writer seems to judge a country only through its economy, because this is the economist. Looking at positive things, he is still able to throw some nasty things in there. ""Universities are mediocre"" ? Either this person has a ridiculous standard for what a good university is, or he does not know what the heck he is talking about. French universities usually don't have much money compared to american, english, and swiss universities. But the teachings are great. Of course it has certain flaws. But for the most part, french universities are places of knowledge. And an old classroom with a whiteboard is usually all that is needed. University is free and open to everyone. You are judged by the quality of your results and work, and not by the amount of money you or your parents have or are ready to borrow. I feel sad when I read, here on reddit, all those stories of students that have to repay crazy loans. University is about knowledge, not about money. If one has to study and repay a loan, he can't really study anything else than something after which he will earn a lot of money. Thus killing a great deal of knowledge, a part of our human heritage. In french universities (I have studied in 2 different universities), I have had great teachers and seen some great work. And from what I've heard the so called ""best"" universities can sometimes be a joke.

* In that same paragraph the writer goes on about the health system. As a french guy that doesn't live in France anymore, having seen different things, especially in this time of recession: I can give him that the french healthcare system is good. But it is far from the best. The writer only writers that the ""health system is widely admired"", and nothing else. I guess he is cautious. Because, truth be told, it's not that good. While I was still living in France, I was only covered for death threatening emergencies, had to pay for most visits to the doctor, had to pay for my glasses and all medical expenses. Luckily for me I don't get ill very often. I'm saying this especially for all those that think that life is golden in France for whoever, like Michael Moore tried to show in Sicko, which is inaccurate and ridiculous. I did like some of his previous stuff, but the inaccuracy of what he talked about in Sicko (the part about France) made me rethink all of that.

* ""Most french people enjoy high living standards"". I fucking wish. I am frugal and don't need much, but if I were to live in France, I'd be fucking dirt poor, wouldn't be able to go out, probably live with my parents, and probably no job for a while. And I'm far from the worst case. I go back to France every once in a while, and year after year of being away, I don't see this ""high living standards"", what I see are people that are tired, poor, sick and miserable. When I see my father who worked all his life (and a big chunk of it in France even though he is not french) as an engineer, who has been laid off just before retirement, I can't stand it when people that don't know this country keep saying that life is sweet. I'm not even talking about my brother who can barely make rent for his 28m² flat or my grandmother.

* The more you go through the article, the more obvious the writer gets. Other references to Louis XIV and his state-financed endeavours. As if this would have anything to do with the liberal world we live in today. In no way 17 and 18th century France was so radically different from other european countries as to make these things he brings up to be of any relevance.

Assimilation takes time, it takes generations. As a child of immigrants in Britain (albeit, Irish) I was distinctly aware of being something slightly different. My mother wanted to call me Finbarr or Fergus, my dad said no as I would be bullied by the other children for having a 'foreign' name. 

I have a close friend who is a 3rd generation Indian Sikh whose mother re-married a Englishman who my friend refers to as his dad. His name is Aaron and he too has that name as his mother didn’t want him having too Indian a name. Aaron had the misfortune of growing up in an area where there is a lot of racial tension between white and Pakistani and he is distinctly aware of what and who he is and sometimes I think it is quite sad he is so vehemently ‘English’ because he is trying to quell deeper feelings of being an outsider. 

He has recently moved into London and just the other day he said ""Don’t you find it annoying that all the train drivers are African and you can’t understand them?"" quite loudly in front of a mixed race carriage and a few ears picked up. He has a tendency to be hostile to other more recent arrivals so he can fit in better.  I also know an Indian girl from Leicester who now lives in Sheffield that doesn’t like Leicester as it is too Indian.  Quite frankly you are slowly seeing assimilation of immigrants whose native cultures are vastly different from our own in Europe.    These things take time, I did notice how the small uproar of poles and eastern Europeans coming to Britain and Ireland has died down, as they are white and their children will be just as 'English' as those who grow around them, but this is a similar European culture.   

When you think of Black immigration into Britain they have been largely accepted now, the main problem as the writer says is with big concentrations of Pakistani and other Muslim groups. And why is that? We all know why, it was 9/11. Suddenly through media and certain repeated words a mass cultural view of all Muslims became tarnished as something wholly negative, much like Jews were in the centuries previous. The best way to assimilate a minority population is not to coerce and force them into accepting our ways, that only makes them feel threatened and more stubborn in keeping theirs. If we try not to highlight our differences so much and persecute their cultural values within two to three generations the children would be just as 'European' as we are

&gt; They saved many lives with what they did in 1995.

 yes, so they did def save civilian lives. OTOH, as far as I understand the balance of evidence against Gotovina, they were just acquitted of all charges brought against them - which is to say, there is no basis for considering they ever targeted civilians, or even failed to take necessary measures to punish and prevent his subordinates from targeting civilians:

&gt;The Appeals Chamber recalls that the Trial Chamber explicitly considered evidence that Mr. Gotovina adopted numerous measures to prevent and minimise crimes and general disorder among the HV troops under his control. The Appeals Chamber further recalls that expert testimony at trial indicated that **Mr. Gotovina took all necessary and reasonable measures to maintain order among his subordinates. In this context**, the Appeals Chamber, Judge Agius dissenting, considers that the **evidence on the record does not prove beyond reasonable doubt that any failure to act on Mr. Gotovina’s part was so extensive as to give rise to criminal liability** pursuant to aiding and abetting or superior responsibility.


&gt; full of care and love for the poor enemy civilians that lost their lives, with all the wisdom and faith in a better peaceful future on the Balkans.

The exodus of Serbs from this area, and multiple war crimes that happened here are def tragic - but there isn't sufficient reason to consider Gotovina is personally, by command responsibility or anyhow else responsible for them.

true,TheExiled,ZBSVUE,U-E,"&gt; Comparing France's president-cenetered statism with the monarchy makes sense to me.

Seems very far fetched to me. Most countries in the world have a state to regulate things, don't they ? Louis XIV's ""statism"" has nothing to do with the fifth republic. My point was that illustrating such an article with Versailles is dishonest, as it tries to portray an image of France that is, in my opinion, very inaccurate.

&gt; Didn't the president say ""je n'ai aucune amitié pour les riches""? What do you call a 75% tax on incomes? Don't you feel that french people are hostile to money, success, capitalism? I do. Plus you need to remember the headtitles of shitty newspapers such as Libération: ""Casse-toi riche con"" or ""Les Patrons en lutte contre la Gauche"" with a certain sense of caricature.

Checked in your history to see if you spoke french. Mon vieux, I am sorry to tell you that you are wrong, and it is always more painful for me to hear such things from french speakers as the information is readily available. **There is no such thing as a 75% income tax in France.** How many times does this need to be repeated ? The first million is NOT taxed at 75%. After the first million euro made, there is a 75% tax beyond that. Call me crazy, but I think it's a good thing.

About Hollande's sentence, I couldn't find a reference online, so I don't know where it comes from. But it seems like a clear reference to Sarkozy who was proudly ""ami des riches"", not only in his political career but also his attitude. Which I believe is wrong, he was our president, not the president of a few.

&gt; You can't talk of a liberal world with a public spending accounting for 57% of national output.

We don't live in a liberal *world* ? I guess I missed the headline.

true,smurfin,null,null,"In theory, it's easy to implement a strategy that doesn't inflate costs. (I'll get to the in practice in a second.) Under the Bismarck model (used in France, Germany, etc) doctors compete with one another, they're not civil servants like under the NHS. So in theory doctors in great demand can charge more, while those that still have to build their name have to lower their prices to attract clients. You're unhappy with your doctor? Drop him for another one. Same goes for pharmacists. So in theory this competition supresses prices. It's your choice if you want to pay the 15% out of pocket of the expensive or the less expensive doctor.     
The same competition goes on between what tax-funded insurance organization you wish to become a client of (called [""Mutuals"" in Belgium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_in_Belgium), and [""Gesetzliche Krankenversicherung"" in Germany](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_in_Germany).) So in theory there is competition between the health providers ànd between the health insurers, both fighting, respectively, for your health expenses and insurance membership fee.    

In practice they made it a bit more complicated though: You MUST become a client with a non-profit health insurer of your choice. There are ""price brackets"" doctors have to respect for most procedures. (So-called vanity procedures such as unneeded plastic surgery, or 'alternative medicines' are exempt from the price ceilings. They can charge what the patient is willing to pay.) So in practice a very good, popular local doctor can't ask €300 for a basic house call, for example. And there are strict controls on how many pharmacists can operate in a given area.

I presume you meant to say, they don't share his opinion that crimes **did** happen? Maybe, hard to say what they can make themselves believe. 

Though, speaking with the rabid nationalists in my family (I'm the black sheep in that respect:) ) , that crimes happened was never denied - numerous but sporadic - what was denied was only that they were done in an orchestrated manner, with the knowledge and involvement of Tudjman and top generals like Gotovina, and with the purpose of ethnic cleansing. They maintain the Serbs left, perhaps justifiably scared of the war and what it brings, but basically in their own organisation.

Nothing was proclaimed on that matter in the trial, since the other relevant actors like Tudjman, Susak, Bobetko are now dead and can't be brought to court. Only that Gotovina wasn't acting so unprofessionally (EDIT or can't be proven to have so acted - but that def is a distinction crowds celebrating won't make)

So I would conclude that there is no evidence Serbs were in fact expelled from Croatia, merely that they fled (and that their return was obstructed is well documented). 

And that they did have good reasons to flee is also documented - but either there isn't a particular instance to fault for these, or those already died.

SO - the various war crimes that were committed during and after Oluja, orchestrated or not, were well documented, on thousands of pages from various witnesses, during this process about Gotovina.

true,fforw,EURO,European Union,"&gt; But the reality is that the northern German states have been bailed out by the southern ones for a similar promise of austerity — a constitutional amendment that outlaws unbalanced budgets.

If you ignore all the years in which the heavy industrial north has helped transforming the south from a predominantly agrarian industry to what it is today.

&gt; a constitutional amendment that outlaws unbalanced budgets. This is causing Germany to be unable to borrow to fund infrastructure improvements at a time where rates are extremely low and when borrowing would be a brilliant idea.

Here's what [Wikipedia says on the Schuldenbremse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balanced_budget_amendment):

&gt; ""In 2009 Germany's constitution was amended to introduce the Schuldenbremse (""debt brake""), a balanced budget provision.[2] This will apply to both the federal government and the Länder (states). From 2016 onwards the federal government will be forbidden to run a structural deficit of more than 0.35% of GDP.""

It's only about the [structural deficit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_and_cyclical_deficit). And we have yet to see how serious this will be taken. For now it's only part of chancellor Merkel's ""Look how awesome we are!"" hypocrisy tour.. (They already took the money we would have to give Greece out of it, e.g.)

c'è poco da azzardare. Se uno propone una cosa assurda tipo che qualcuno lancia lacrimogeni dal ministero di giustizia, uno pensa all'ipotesi più probabile, ovvero che un lacrimogeno sia rimbalzato, come è infatti successo.

&gt; Comunque, anche ammettendo che la prima serie di scie discendenti sia in realtà dovuta ad un singolo lacrimogeno sparato dal basso 
&gt; verso l'alto e frantumatosi sulla parte alta della finestra, rimangono  grosse lacune da chiarire:

&gt; la seconda scia. quella parte dal tetto o dal cornicione superiore: un secondo lacrimogeno? un tiro sbagliato è possibile, due consecutivi molto di meno;

Il filmato mostra solo la cima della finestra. è un fumogeno spiovente che è stato lanciato (secondo botto), fa la sua parabola e non compare nel frame finchè non è all'ultima parte della sua traiettoria, dove il contrasto con la parete scura rende possibile vedere il fumo (nota che il candelotto non si vede praticamente mai). Nota inoltre che manca la percezione di profondità, essendo un filmato. Quel secondo candelotto poteva essere a metri dal muro.

&gt; non trovo riferimenti sul tipo di lancia-lacrimogeni in dotazione alla ns polizia, ma da questo video posso dedurre che la portata sia di 100-150 metri (se mi sbaglio mi corrigerete); questo significherebbe che chi ha tirato è completamente inetto oppure lo ha fatto apposta. Nel secondo caso perchè?

Forse per ridurre la forza di caduta? o perchè ha sparato ma è stato spintonato? Che ne sai?

&gt; è vero che si sente uno ""sparo"" prima delle prime scie e un ""ting"" entrambi compatibili con il lancio dall'esterno, ma è anche vero che poi si sentono altri 2 spari in sequenza: uno potrebbe essere il secondo lacrimogeno, ma il terzo?

Fuori frame? Cilecca (non sparato, o niente fumo)? Sparato in un'altra direzione?

&gt; Non ho mai visto o sentito di un lacrimogeno che si rompa in più frammenti a seguito di un urto. c'è da dire che non sono un esperto però

Appunto.

&gt; ma soprattutto: perchè lanciare lacrimogeni su della gente che si sta allontanando (abbastanza tranquillamente) dalla zona degli scontri?

Per evitare che tornino indietro? per isolare la zona consentendo a chi è nel palazzo di uscire in sicurezza ?

&gt;If this does not happen, and one or more countries encounter a downturn that the ECB cannot remedy by means of system-wide monetary policy, there are only two alternatives.
&gt;
&gt;One is that the countries concerned endure a deeper and longer recession than they are used to, or is necessary. This plainly runs the risk of calling forth mounting protests against EMU itself. The other is that the fiscal powers available to the centre—the money gathered and spent by Brussels—must be greatly enlarged. This would allow automatic fiscal stabilisers to work within Europe as they do within the United States of America. Many in Europe would regard this second alternative as desirable in any case, which (if the stability pact survives) makes it the more probable outcome. In any event, this seems likely to be the issue on which Europe's political future turns.
&gt;
&gt; ...
&gt;
&gt;As it is, the chances of success are no better than fair. The central bank will have to rise above its flawed design. And governments will have to find a way to make fiscal policy respond far more flexibly to economic circumstances than the Maastricht rules allow.
&gt;
&gt; ...
&gt;
&gt;If EMU can overcome the flaws of its design and prove an economic success after all, Europe's governments (and, preferably, their citizens as well) will be able to weigh the coming political choices on their merits. If it fails in economic terms, those political choices may be severely constrained—and, as a result, far more divisive. Closer political integration built on the solid foundation of an EMU that worked would be one thing. The same course adopted in distress to save EMU from failure, or even outright collapse, would be an entirely different, and much more dangerous, enterprise.",0,1353080327,null,0,1353085934,0,c72b8cj,t3_1399b3,t1_c72b8cj,t1_c72actc,null,1430422398,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

Moreover, in the case of the UK, you already have large amounts of ethnic minorities and you can cry about it but you'll never give them the boot.

I agree with you that multiculturalism can be shit. It implies a separate-but-equal breakup of society. I say when in Rome you do as the Romans. The lesson from the USA is that you need a national identity that can exist without ethnicity. That's not to say you should downplay ethnicity; it just means that there needs to be something bigger that everyone can make their own. The US doesn't get this perfectly right, but it's on to something with that kind of idea.

What's funny to me is that the people who are most concerned with foreigners not integrating are precisely those that do the most to create that multicultural, divided society. Demonizing immigrants only contributes to that divided society. Like I said, you'll never kick them out. So fight for tighter immigration control side by side with better integration programs, such as education and the like.

&gt;According to French police records, **he became involved in criminal activities, which led to arrest warrants being issued for robbery and extortion**; it has been reported that he served at least one two-year prison sentence, though this has been denied by his attorneys.[12] Dominique Erulin claims the accusations were a political ploy made up by the left-wing factions allied with President François Mitterrand.[8] Towards the end of the decade he moved to South America, where he provided training to a number of right-wing paramilitary organizations, notably in Argentina and Guatemala. He met his future wife, Ximena Dalel, in Colombia and had a daughter; they later divorced.
&gt;Arrested during a travel to France (Paris), **he was sentenced in 1986 to five years of prison by Paris' Cour d'assise.[13] He was freed the next year, ""in circumstances showing that he was benefiting from very particular protections"".**[10] However, Gotovina's lawyers have submitted a brief to the International War Crimes Tribunal alleging that Gotovina was in fact framed by a criminal police group loyal to Francois Mitterrand, a group which was convicted for official misconduct by French courts in 2005.[14]
