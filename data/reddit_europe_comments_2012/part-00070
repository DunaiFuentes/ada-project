true,TheMentoMan,null,null,"It's true, it really is weird writing in German on reddit. Even in /r/Munich we always post in English, so others can understand. 

Funny you mention foreign visitors at the Wiesn. A friend of mine has a world map in her apartment and whenever she meets a foreign guy at the Oktoberfest she has a picture of herself taken with him. She then later prints out the pictures and sticks them to the map. Obviously, her goal is to 'collect' men from as many countries as possible. We definitely get A LOT of foreign visitors, though I can't tell you any statistics. We do get a lot of Americans and Australians, but also loads of British, South American and Asian people. And the second weekend is Italienerwochenende, for some reason all the Italians attend the Oktoberfest on those two days. And yes, guys flirt and grope a lot but that's kind of the point. As long as it's all in good fun and not threatening or creepy we usually don't mind. 

It's also kind of become a thing to dress very flashy at the Wiesn, and if possible in national dress. So many scots will wear kilts for example. I also met some South Africans last year who had bright orange overalls (Latzhosen) on and they made a mark on them with a black marker for every pint they drank. It was very amusing. It's really fun to meat so many people from all over the world. And because everybody is so drunk it's really easy to get to know each other. 

How much you spend depends on what you like to do. If you like to go on the rides then you'll have to shell out a lot of money, one ride is around 6/7 Euro. Though Tuesdays is family day, so everything is half price. And a Maß costs nearly 9 Euro nowadays. As you get the most out of the experience by going to a tent early in the morning and staying until the bitter end (the Oktoberfest closes at 11pm), you'll likely be drinking at least 6 or 7 Maß. The food is very expensive as well, as are souvenirs. I dunno, I reckon you'll spend at least 100 Euro on everything.

true,TheMentoMan,null,null,"If you only want to come to Munich for the Wiesn you should consider couch surfing. It's free and you instantly have a local to go to the Oktoberfest with you. Some even offer more than once couch or bed, so you can take your friends along with you too. Though you'll have to sort out accommodation as soon as possible, hotel rooms, beds, couches and even camping places fill up very quickly. 

I've never really experienced aggressive sexual harassment at the Wiesn so far. We have a lot of security and there are so many people around you that it's easy to draw attention to yourself when you feel like you're being harassed. Also, the tents are so large and so full that when you feel the people you're talking to are weird or creepy you can very easily just leave and disappear in the crowd. 

And believe me, you can get soooooo drunk from Oktoberfest beer! It's stronger than regular beer and it goes into your system very quickly because you're usually dehydrated and have little food in your stomach. It's very easy to forget to eat and drink water when you're having a good time, and with all the dancing and the many people around you you sweat a lot. So after 3 Maß you'll definitely be totally wasted. I mean, I like to think that I can handle a fair bit of alcohol, but last year I drank 4 Maß and I was as drunk as I had never been before. It was ridiculous. Thank God my friend hat stayed sober, without her my cousin and I would have ended up sleeping on the ground in front of one of the tents. Honestly, it was a wonder we made it home. My cousin, who is very tall and strong, and so by default alone handles alcohol very well usually, even passed out at one point and we only got him up with the help from some random strangers who were walking by. My friend somehow managed to get us a taxi in which my cousin threw up at least once (I was asleep during the whole ride) and from what my mum told me he threw up several times during the night.

Yeah i thought about couchsurfing but I guess that it's not that easy to get a couch during the time of the oktoberfest. Just because there are so many people who want to have a sleeping place. And I guess that there are some people with a spare couch but who are hesitant to offer a place to a stranger who just wants to party at the Oktoberfest because that person could react like your cousin, especially if this person wants to go to the Oktoberfest the first time (like me) and isn't used to the strong stuff they serve at the Wiesn ;)

Yeah the biggest problem I see about the Reddit meet up you have in mind is for everybody to have somekind of sleeping place.

I can't understand why so many European countries choose (or chose) war. I don't want them to choose war on my behalf. I don't want to be associated with what is happening in the Middle East or Africa, it's nothing to do with me. I don't want to be ""a force for good in the world"" or any other platitudinous nonsense. Asking me to join your union because you're afraid of another war is practically blackmail. 

Many elements of our culture are shared, or derivations, or usurpations. I recognise that better than you might think, I speak English after all. My religion was Roman Catholicism. My legal system is based on the English common law tradition. How can another country understand my cultural position, when they weren't under foreign control for nearly a thousand years. That leaves a cultural mark that is hard to explain. We do not see ourselves as you see yourself. I don't think it's ridiculous to point that out, it would seem self-evident.

I think it's unfair to describe me as willfully ignorant. I am certainly ignorant of many mainland cultural traditions, but that is because they have little to no impact on my life. I'm not exposed to them. I didn't grow up watching foreign TV like you have done. That is a result of living on a small island hundreds or thousands of kilometers West of ""all the action"". I can't get into my car and drive for a few hours to experience a radically different culture. I have to do it as a tourist, not as a neighbour. Can you see the distinction?

Regarding self-interest being the same as common interest, that's another platitude. It's not some great insight.

true,TheMentoMan,null,null,"I study film studies and my dissertation is a study on platonic friendships between men in films produced by Judd Apatow (40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up, Superbad ect). Basically my dissertation is about bromances. I find it very interesting how nowadays men, in films at least, are allowed to show their emotions without fear of emasculation. So far, in buddy films or cop movies you usually had two strong male characters who tried to one up each other in their 'masculinity' which is associated in Western society with toughness, courage, cooness, big build etc. Sharing feelings would instantly make them too feminine or gay, so in those films the men would never talk about their relationship. In Judd Apatow's films men constantly tell each other how much they love each other. In fact, you will notice that in most bromances today the men only get with the girl after they expressed their love to their male friend. I find this very interesting. It really opened up my mind to how difficult it must be for men to deal with their emotions. They are constantly told they must always act cool and strong and never admit weakness or feelings. But like all humans men naturally also feel emotions too and they shouldn't feel it's a bad thing to admit them, not even to your best friend. Because the whole notion of feelings being bad is very sexist. The logic is feelings=female=bad. But feelings shouldn't be associated with the female gender in the first place, we all have them. And being female shouldn't be a bad thing either. I, personally, think being female rocks pretty hard. But in Western society the notion that men must under no circumstances be too feminine still prevails. And yet in Judd's films the men manage to admit their feelings and still maintain their masculinity. I really like this and I like studying mainstream films. It's not as pretentious as studying Hitchcock or Kubrick and it's much more relevant to present day society.

I love movies and tv shows (although my love for realy good tv series grows stronger daily) and I'm really interested in the behaviour of people, especially how these people interact with each other (and what part the society plays in all of this). And its quite good that this interests me because I'm studying Sociology, otherwise that wouldn't be a good fit.

For men this are difficicult times in general. It's easy if you know what the social accepeted behaviour is, if you know what the society expects  from you so you can behave along those lines (or not if you chose to). Just as a guideline to know how to play it safe. Not that long ago it was quite clear what was expected from a man. The role of a man in society was cut quite clear. The man was ""the man in the house"", didn't speak about his feelings and his past time was to sit in a bar and drink some beer while silently sitting near a buddy. (I exaggerate a bit of course). Today we are in a transition phase. The women are here, earn their own money and they are not going away anytime soon. They are confident and don't have to rely on a man anymore. It was integral for a man and his manlyness to provide for his family, now the woman can do this too. But we are still in a transition phase, we are not at the end of the road of gender equality and the expactation of how men/women should behave is still very much impressed from the time of our fathers. But men can't behave like the old days, but the rules for the new days aren't out yet. How much of showing feelings is socially acceptable? How much of **not** showing emotions is socially acceptable? Metrosexuality? Or just the simple question of ""How does a man treat a woman the right way on dates in times of (so called) gender equality?"" Just the different expectations woman have in men gets men confused. We moved on from the times that a man didn't show feelings at all, but we aren't there yet that he can show them fully. 

So bromances is were it's at right now;) Although I have to say in my experience men don't have a best friend the way women often do. These bromances seem cool in television, but I think in real life men often have several ""best friends"", but none of them nearly as close as the best friend of women. But maybe that's changing in these times, too and the bromances on screen are an early signing of this. Maybe it's a sign that it has become harder for men in society and they need someone to be able to speak about things in order to find the way in our society.

I don't want to complain about how men are treated badly from the society. I belive quite the contrary: Sexism is quite real, from women mostly experienced when they leave the school or University to begin to work in the ""real world"". Up to that point I would say that women aren't treated worse than men (maybe one could say that women get favoured in our current educational system, but that is for another time) but once a women sets foot into workplace it changes rather dramatically. I just wantedt to bring my point accross that it got harder for men in these times, especially how he should behave emotionally.

Take modern European languages, for instance; not only do they have a great number of words in common, but also more people are learning each other's languages now than ever before.  Go to a supermarket in a random European country; chances are, you can't easily tell which country it is at a glance.  Most of us watch the same films and TV series, read the same books, eat more or less the same food, celebrate more or less the same holidays, similar political systems, similar views on human rights and so on.  There is such thing as a European culture, but a lot of people don't notice it, exactly because it is already integrated in our everyday lives.  Also, I suppose a lot of us have more in common with some Redditors than with people from our own country.  I think all these are definitely uniting us.

That's true. In almost all films I study for my dissertation the men have more than one male friend and the friends always do things in a group. Though I think the whole best friend issue is just another stereotype our society persists on maintaining. I hang around /r/TwoXChromosomes a lot and really so many posts are about women who find it really difficult to make female friends. They don't think they can confide in women at all, they are either very suspicious about other women or feel threatened by them. I went to an all-girls school, so obviously all my friends were girls and I couldn't imagine not having a female best friend. After all, every woman in TV and films have best friends, and all the guys have a group of loose friends. But I don't think that's really that true. I think it's only what society expects us to do; women have one or two best friends and men have a gang of buddies, that's how friendships look like. So little naive me never imagined women and men could be really close friends, but as it turns out they can. One of my very closest friends is a guy, we can tell each other everything. And it's really annoying when others think there's something going on between us. We are so conditioned to think that if a straight man and a straight women are very close, there must be romantic feelings involved. And that they probably just suppress their true feelings or deny them, but really they're totally in love. Ah well, what do I care.

&gt; New words every day; three or more words in many combinations; functors begin to appear; many grammatical errors and idiosyncratic expressions; good understanding of language

So early in life, yes at age two even, you are primed to learn language; there is no better time to get exposed to it. If a child actively consumes a languages, or better yet interacts with it, at an early age it will come to understand it at the level of native proficiency. This opens a whole world to them early on in life, and can help them immensely. They can perfectly integrate in to other (similar) cultures, better understand undertones, have less of an accent, and communicate better with over a billion people rather than just our millions.  I am not saying that they won't be able to do this later in life none the less, but their adeptness and ability to do it will greatly increase. Learning languages later in life is a joke.

true,fleckes,null,null,"&gt;One of my very closest friends is a guy, we can tell each other everything. And it's really annoying when others think there's something going on between us. We are so conditioned to think that if a straight man and a straight women are very close, there must be romantic feelings involved. And that they probably just suppress their true feelings or deny them, but really they're totally in love 

Isn't that the the plot of Harry and Sally? ;) I'm sorry, you must get that a lot, but the resamblance is uncanny. And Harry and Sally is a great film, one of the few romantic comedys that are actually good movies, not just good for romantic comedy standard. (Although I have to say I'm a little bit a sucker for some RomComs, my guilty pleasure. But since men can show their feelings now I have nothing to be ashamed of. Just guilty of liking crappy movies maybe;))

&gt;They don't think they can confide in women at all, they are either very suspicious about other women or feel threatened by them

Why? I heard a saying along the lines ""A women is a womens worst enemy"" and that women are criticised and judged by woman extremly harshly, but why is that? I think that's quite interesting.

&gt;Though I think the whole best friend issue is just another stereotype our society persists on maintaining

I guess once a men shared his deepest feelings with some other dude, this dude is becoming special and gets to be the best friend. Until then, you just have more dude friends. So I think that ultimately its the issue of showing emotions and sharing them with someone, and the male gender hasn't arrived at this point just yet. Of course this gets reinforced by the media.

&gt;I honestly just pretend we don't have a TV anymore nowadays

I watch almost no regular TV nowadays, although I watch more TV series than ever. I just can't watch it anymore like you said. Since I discovered to watch movies and shows in english I can't stand the dubbed versions anymore. I had a movie collection of over 1000 (pirated, I know it's bad) dubbed movies and I gave them away to a friend. I only watch some sports on TV (I'm quite a sports fan,too. Especially football, so I have sweaty palms already because of the game today) and sometimes I watch ""Schlag den Raab"", I think it's strangely fascinating. And I watch the Münster Tatort, it's quite funny and the Münsterland is my home ;). But that's about it of regular TV for me. And I don't know München 7, but I think that's a regional thing. Does it air on BR?

&gt;What kind of shows do you watch?

Regardless of what you wear, people will know you are American the second you open your mouth.  If you want to keep a low profile.. keep it down, and don't spend every night in the Moose bar.

Dead American Giveaways Fashion-wise
- Running shoes with every outfit
- Flip flops
- Coach purses
- Short khaki shorts with the obligatory oversized windbreaker with Greek letters on it
- Any breast bigger than a B cup (this is a land of small boobs)
- Overly tight clothing on an overweight girl
- Colorful clothes.. Parisians dress like they're going to a funeral.. I don't know why.

That being said.. I love Paris and I hope you have a good trip.  Unless you're fluent in French, everyone will know you're American.  I love guessing where people are from and usually the best tell for people is the brand of their clothing/purses and shoes.

French people have a boner for Abercrombie for some unknown reason so worst case scenario, dig out some of your highschool (or even middleschool) Abercrombie clothes you ditched years ago and rock the Bobo style.

We've actually never gotten the Harry and Sally reference before, and I'm glad we didn't. Thankfully my friend has quite a lot of female friends so we don't stand out that much as a 'couple'. And I'm pretty in tune with my feelings, suppressing them generally doesn't work. And even if I do, when I get drunk or stoned they usually just come spilling out. And my friend and I have been drunk and stoned together on numerous occasions and even shared a bed two or three times and neither of us had any inclination of touching the other. He's much older than me so I think of him like the older brother I never had and he says he sees me as a sister he doesn't hate for a change (he doesn't get along with his siblings). 

&gt;I'm a little bit a sucker for some RomComs

I really dislike romcoms. They are so cheesy! There are some good ones, sure. I think Love, Actually is really good, so is (500) Days of Summer and a childhood favorite of mine is Splash. But I won't even go near films like The Notebook or Sleepless in Seattle. I don't mind watching real, believable love stories, but I can't stand sappy, cheesy, unnecessarily romantic stuff. I went to watch P.S. I Love You with my girlfriends a couple years back. I had read the book and it was really good. But my friends all though they HAD to cry because that's what girls do when they watch sad love stories. So I ended up in a cinema, watching a film that had turned a lovely book into crap, with 5 girls who tried as hard as they could to squeeze a tear out. The sounds they made were so embarrassing.

&gt;A women is a womens worst enemy

To be honest, I don't really know what these women who feel threatened by other women think. I grew up around women all my life so I like having them around. I heard that some women stopped trusting other women when they caught their boyfriends cheating. Others feel that they are constantly being judged by women and feel like they can't ever escape the stereotypical 'mean girls'. Many women are taught to be very competitive. They learn from an early age to be very judgmental of themselves and of others. Everything becomes a contest, only that nobody acknowledges it. Boys are taught to fight things out in the open, women are taught to fight sneakily and behind each other's backs. That's why girls and even grown women can be much meaner than men. We know that with women everything happens behind your back, so if a woman compliments you, you can never know if she really means it or if she's going to bitch about you later on to her friends. I never grew up with this mentality. I knew that girls bitch behind each other's back, I admit I did it too when I was in school. But it never made me suspicious of other women are made me overly judgmental of others. I grew past that a long time ago. I guess other women never do that, I don't know. I like to think that I surround myself with decent people. 

&gt;""Schlag den Raab"", I think it's strangely fascinating.

I find Stefan Raab highly entertaining. I went to Cologne two years ago to see the Autoball WM and it was really funny. I always wanted to watch a Schlag den Raab show live as well, but they only announce new shows on short notice and I always forget to check online when the next one is on.

München 7 was aired on BR the last two seasons but the newest season aired on ARD. I think the last episode was on a couple of weeks ago, hopefully a fourth season will be filmed this summer. 

I've actually been thinking about Friends a lot lately, I've been watching Matt LeBlanc's newest series *Episodes* in which he plays a fictionalised version of himself. I really want to watch all 10 seasons of Friends again, I know there are about half a dozen episodes I haven't watched yet. Friends evokes real nostalgia in me, I've been aware of the show since I was a kid. When I was little I really disliked it, I didn't find it funny at all. But my older cousin loved to watch it so I would catch glimpses of it here and there. Then Pro7 started airing it daily and all of my friends started watching it. We loved talking about it during class, it was our number 1 topic of discussion. And the first season of Friends was the first ever season of any show I bought on DVD. I had never owned a season on VHS or DVD before, the mere thought of having a show on disc in your own home was mind blowing. Oh man, I really want to watch it again now.

Sorry, that guy does absolutely nothing for me. I think it's cool though that mancrushes are becoming more acceptable now. I have a friend who openly admits to having a mancrush on Ryan Gosling and I find it highly entertaining to see him talk about him and his films while his girlfriend sits next to him and rolls her eyes. 

&gt;I have the feeling a woman who says what's on her mind gets labeled as ""Bitch"" or rather quickly.

I feel the same way. I can say in the nicest and friendliest tone that I don't like a certain girl in my class, or I don't find her attractive, and people often assume I am jealous of her. It can get a bit annoying, but then again I don't really feel the need very often to openly criticise other people. And if I do then it's with friends who I know will understand I'm just making an observation and not being a jealous 'bitch'. As to the promiscuity thing, I'm very fortunate that both my parents and most friends I've had were always sex positive. In my school we never, ever considered anybody a slut or a prude. Mostly, because our sex lives weren't discussed that openly. Like I mentioned, I went to an all-girls school, so you often didn't know if a girl had a boyfriend or not, we only knew what our closest friends were up to outside of school. But I think double standard regarding promiscuity still exists in our society and it's totally ridiculous. As long as you don't hurt anybody people should be free to do what the hell they want. 

&gt;Matt LeBlanc's newest series Episodes

I've watched all episodes so far and I quite like the show. It's not the best series in the world, but I like the combination of English and American humour. 

I actually don't watch the Game of Thrones. I have this thing that whenever a show is really hyped I don't want to watch it. Even if loads of people I know recommend it, it kind of puts off. I don't know why, it just does. I've been meaning to watch Breaking Bad for ages, I even watched the first episode. But everybody keeps raving about it, so I've been hesitant to watch it further. I also want to watch Mad Men, but I'll just have to wait until the hype cools off. I think my favorite dramas are Dexter, House, Six Feet Under, Fringe and United States of Tara, and my favorite sitcomes are 30 Rock, Community, Parks and Rec, The League, Modern Family, Bored to Death and How I Met Your Mother.

It's not that overhyped, but really great. The first few episodes are good but not that awesome because they center too much around the case-of-the-week. But when that gets more or less abandoned it get's really good. Or is this too much rave about the show and it puts you off? Do you just want to find TV shows that you like on your on? ;)

&gt; Dexter

great, although the last season not the highest standard imo

&gt; House

Really like it, although it's always more or less the same. But the main charakter is that great.

&gt;Six Feet Under

Great. But somehow I only watched the first 2 seasons. Need to get back watching the rest some time

&gt;United States of Tara

I thought it was quite good, but somehow I didn't get back to watching after some episodes

&gt;30 Rock

The first seasons were really comedy gold. Haven't started to watch the new season yet.

&gt; Community

Yeah, it's just great.

&gt;Parks and Rec

Need to start watching it. everybody is raving about it...

&gt;The League

Unbelievably good, considering I know almost nothing about american football and know literally knowone they are constantly takling about and wishing to trade somebody.

&gt;Bored to Death

Comedy jewel. I just recently watched all seasons (well, it were just 8 episodes per season). But not the kind humour for everyone (ohh I get a hipstery feeling here)

&gt;How I Met Your Mother

I loved the first 3 seasons. This was the first series I discovered and watched in english, all episodes beak to back till the at that point only available 3 season. The newer seasons have quite some meh episodes, but I haven't watched the most recen episodes yet.

Exactly! We have the same accents and the same 'sound profile'. I always thought that a Spaniard could easily pass for a native Greek speaker with very little effort, much like a Greek could pass as a native Spanish speaker. This is very difficult (for us) to do with British English, for example.

I think Italian is also pretty close to Greek, although not as much as Spanish is (it's too melodic).

Drop everything and start watching that show! It is pure genius. The first season isn't very impressive though, it's only in season two that it gets really good. God, I have the hugest crush on the character Ron Swanson. I am almost obsessed with that guy and I very rarely develop crushes like that. He simply epitomises American, rugged masculinity. I usually don't go for that type at all, but Ron Swanson man. Ron fuckin Swanson.

Yeah, I have absolutely no clue who those guys are talking about either, but the show is still entertaining as shit. I nearly died when Jeff Goldblum guest starred as Ruxin's father. I just love how real and sometimes even horrible the characters are to each other, it's so refreshing. Alone for coining the term 'vaginal hubris' should the show win an award or something.

I only discovered the show a couple of days ago too and have watched all three seasons since. Such a shame it wasn't continued. It was so intelligent and funny in it's own way, I really loved it.

Up until some month ago, when I downloaded the episode, startet the whole series again and watched it all. Kind of the same thing with Six Feet Under. I watched the first two seasons in german. Then I made the transition to english.  I didn't quite know what to do, if I should watch the watched episodes again in english. And then the  series slipped away from me.

- German is my favourite, at times almost poetic (reciting Goethe for example), at times it sounds like barking orders on the parade ground.

- Swedish and Norwegian sound like ""musical German"". 

- My French teacher once advised the best way to speak French is while smoking a Gitane. It can sometimes sound very cool.

- Russian sounds, in the words of Anthony Burgess, like a ""vodka-soaked rumble"". I like the sound of Polish, which sounds like a softer, more nasal form of Russian.

- Worst sounding language? Sorry Denmark...lovely country and people but by God, that's not a language, it's a national speech impediment.

Greek does not make a distinction between deep and shallow 'sh', so it's the first thing a Greek speaker notices on a British voice. Short, sharp peaks in pronunciation. Can sound pretentious but also authoritative.
* American English: Flat, quick, simplified. No-nonsense. Much easier to comprehend for Greek ears.
* Spanish: Very similar to Greek. You can practically hear the Mediterranean sea in them. They sound very sexy when spoken by a female voice (male voices sound 'brotherly' to me).
* Italian: Much like Spanish, only with a bit more melody (Spanish sounds more flat, like my native language). Also, a language that seems designed to make it easy to keep speaking and speaking :)
* Cypriot Greek: Come on guys, you're doing it on purpose! Stop singing! :)
* Russian: Deep, very heavy accent. Those guys know how to roll their 'R's (I'm looking at you France).
* German: Sounds harsh, angry. Too many consonants, a language to command into.
* French: Very smooth, a bit effeminate, even when spoken by deep-voiced males. No 'R's. Cultured, sophisticated, aloof.

Of course it sounds like 'tsair'! :) As you know, there are no 'ch' or 'sh' sounds in modern Greek. By that, I mean that they cannot be written down, either as a single letter or as a combination of many letters. The closest ones are 'ts' and 's'. Now, this is very important to a Greek speaker, because Greek is an entirely phonetic language. If it can't be written down, it doesn't exist. You can try to pronounce it, *but it's not a proper part of the language*. You can't direct the reader 'here, pronounce this part as ch, not as ts'. This will have to be done by memory (i.e. you remember that this is how it's supposed to be pronounced and ignore what you see written down). One that always puzzled us Greek students when we were in the UK was this: if you want to say 'Lester', why do you write 'Leicester'? If you want to say 'Kernel', why do you write 'Colonel'?

I guess you are referring to the ""z"" sound as in *cabeza* or *zoo*. It's a bit stronger than the *th* sound in English. If I'm not mistaken in most of the regions of Spain is pronounced this way. However, in Andalusia, the canary islands and america, the pronunciation changes to the *s* sound.

I believe both pronunciations are correct. I'm Spanish myself and use the *th* sound.

Becoming neighbors rather than tourists is exact the process that we are undergoing on the continent. I'll remind you that countries like Sweden or Finland are also removed from ""the blue banana"" of cultural activity in Europe, but they are still more than able to take part in it.

- If they like spicy food, maybe some hot sauce or harder to find spices (in France), something Cajun or Mexican*ish*, canned jalapeños or chipotle peppers or jambalaya mix. Don't bother with Sriracha sauce, it's quite easy to find in most Asian shops in France.

- Good BBQ sauce.

For the kids(?)

- Beef jerky.

- Peanut butter. Quite easy to find in France but really expensive and most French people have never tasted it.

- Reese Cups.

- Soda pop from lesser known local brands, root beer.

Food is hit or miss but if they don't like it they'll take pity on you and it'll be another incentive for them to show off French cuisine!

**Coffee table books**

- About where you live, where you grew up, local landmarks, etc.

true,premiumserenium,null,null,"A federal Europe would speak with a unified voice on the world stage. It would have a unified foreign policy. That foreign policy would (ideally) be decided by majority vote. If that majority vote conflicted with a nations pre-established position, the afore-mentioned nation would have no choice but to support the policy. Perhaps even to the degree of sending their sons and daughters to die. 

History has shown us that some European countries will choose war over diplomacy. Economics shows us that some European countries rely on war (or defense if you want to call it that) to maintain employment, technological prowess, engineering skills, and tax receipts. Germanys submarine trade with Israel is one example. (Yes I know it is more complicated than that but this is an example of maintaining skills and infrastructure).

It is perfectly conceivable that a federal Europe will choose a direction that would drag nations into a war they would never have chosen otherwise. For example France would not like to be in a war with their past colonies, but Britain wouldn't care because they have no cultural connection to those countries. When Turkey joins up fully they would not like to be in a Middle Eastern war, but Germany would not have the same considerations.

A unified European army will be created at some point, that is an inevitability. It has been tried already and it will keep being tried until it succeeds. Under a federal system it does not make sense for nations to maintain the cost of separate armies. So for purely economic reasons a united army will someday be created.

What happens to the countries with minority voting rights (and no right to a veto) under such a system? They will be forced to go to war against their will in order to maintain federal coherence. Treaties will be worded in such a way to make any other option impossible. Unless exemptions are negotiated, like Ireland has done. For example there is no mechanism for a country to leave the Euro currency, even if it would be in their best interest. The treaties do not allow it.

I'm not saying a federal Europe will go looking for wars (but it will have to take a position on existing conflicts), I'm saying that in the case of a war one voice will speak for all nations. That voice may be technically representative of all those nations, but not realistically representative due to how the voting is weighted and due to historical and cultural positions.

You mean like drafting? In Europe? To support wars abroad?

Do you really think that will be more of an issue if we further integration?

&gt;History has shown us that some European countries will choose war over diplomacy.

Not in the last 60 years since we started to integrate. We are writing history.

&gt;Economics shows us that some European countries rely on war (or defense if you want to call it that) to maintain employment, technological prowess, engineering skills, and tax receipts.

Not as of now. And I hear about no Jingoism whatsoever inside the EU, it's in fact pretty much the opposite, every time France of the UK decide to interfere somewhere, there's public demonstrations against it. So no, I don't think that this will ever be an issue.

&gt;For example France would not like to be in a war with their past colonies, but Britain wouldn't care because they have no cultural connection to those countries.

What? Why would France or the UK ever want to start wars in their previous colonies? And why would the people advocating military intervention ever be able to achieve so, specially against such strong and severe opposition? It's ludicrous! The way you're talking, it seems a stronger EU is just a plot for us to dominate the world by arms again!

&gt;When Turkey joins up fully they would not like to be in a Middle Eastern war, but Germany would not have the same considerations.

Turkey will never join the EU nor will Germany want to spend millions in fighting worthless unpopular wars in the Middle East, for no reason whatsoever.

&gt;'m saying that in the case of a war one voice will speak for all nations. That voice may be technically representative of all those nations, but not realistically representative due to how the voting is weighted and due to historical and cultural positions.

I'm pretty sure if this ever happens, we'll just say we support peace and perhaps try to profit a bit from it without ever becoming directly involved.

EDIT: Alright, here's the scoop: 


[Here's](http://www.alhambra-patronato.es/index.php/Como-visitar-la-Alhambra/8+M5d637b1e38d/0/?&amp;cHash=e96dd36b3924986ff12336a14fd5082a) the official page for buying tickets. Alhambra General Admission will get you in to everything; it is a self-guided tour. If you're into history and are considering a guided tour, I'd say it's worth the money. Should be around 50 euros; you can decline the transport and just meet them at the meeting spot. The link above will take you to legitimate guided tours. Yes, it does seem like travel agencies trying to milk tourists for profit, but if you sign up for just a tour of the Alhambra it will be exactly that. Yes, they have audioguides, so that might be the best option for you. 

I hear Fuengirola is nice, though I've never been. I hope you spend plenty of time in Granada. It is an incredible city and deserves two-three days of exploration in my opinion. Here are my recommendations (besides the Alhambra):

1. Explore and spend time in the **Albayzín**. It is Granada's old city and the architecture is intricate and wondrous. While in the Albayzín, you must go to the [Mirador de San Nicolas](http://goo.gl/maps/uiRQ), both during the day and during the evening for spectacular views of the Sierra Nevada mountains to the left, the Alhambra in the foreground, and the city of Granada to the right. [Here's](http://www.panoramio.com/photo_explorer#view=photo&amp;position=48&amp;with_photo_id=65952583&amp;order=date_desc&amp;user=6615322) a panoramic picture I took. 

2. Eat **Tapas**. They are a highlight of Spanish gastronomy and Granada is literally the best place in Spain to eat Tapas, because here they are *free* with a drink. Order a *caña* (beer) or a *copa de Rioja* (Rioja is the region that produces Spain finest wine) and you will either get to pick a tapa from a menu of various options or you will simply be given whatever the house has prepared for that evening. For 10 euros one person can have five tapas and five drinks. 

Here's a list of places you must go if you can: 

 - [Bar Avila](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187441-d1631456-Reviews-Bar_Avila-Granada_Province_of_Granada_Andalucia.html) Go here and order *jamon asado*. It is roast pork on a piece of bread with olive oil and spices. My all time favorite. 

 - [POE](http://www.barpoe.com/) Non-Spanish tapas which are about 15x better than spanish tapas. Really, really delicious menu of 8 different tapas. Owner is British. 

 - For excellent fried fish go to [Bar Diamantes I or II](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g187441-d900012-r120774430-Los_Diamantes-Granada_Province_of_Granada_Andalucia.html) 

 - If you want a sit-down meal, I ate at [La Albahaca](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g187441-d1004509-Reviews-Albahaca-Granada_Province_of_Granada_Andalucia.html) my last night in Granada and it was a moderately priced, savory and excellent meal. 

I think the only one of these that is open for lunch is Bar Avila, in the event that you go home at night for dinner. 

3. Above the Alhambra there is a very cool park called [Carmen de los Martires](http://www.lovegranada.com/places/carmen-martires/). Get there if you can. 

4. If you like seeing Cathedrals, Granada's is worth the effort. If you are interested in Spain and Granada's history, Los Reyes Catolicos are buried here. 

I suppose these things for me are the highlights of Granada. If going to any of the Bars I've listed is too much of a hassle, go anywhere where you see way too many people. They will make room for you, and they're probably there because the food is good.  

Outside of Granada, I would absolutely recommend without a doubt that you to [Ronda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronda). Incredible little town. You can see the world's oldest purpose built bull ring, and the bridge that is in the Wiki article's main photo is incredible. 

I went and saw the caves in Nerja and left unsatisfied. If you do enjoy cave formations, I would go, as it does have the world's largest rock column in a cave (no idea what else to call it). It was expensive though, at 8.50 per entry. 

Cordoba's *Mezquita* is quite spectacular. The Alcazar there (where los Reyes Catolicos used to stay) is cool, as well as the old city. Other than these things, there isn't much to do. Definitely worth it if you're into Cathedrals. 

Have you booked housing yet? You should try airbnb.com. It let's you rent apartments from people. Tends to be cheaper and you get a kitchen!

1.  Never carry valuables in your pockets.  Seriously, ever.
2.  Do your best not to look like a tourist.  I have yet to be targeted by a scammer in Madrid after half a year here.  I don't carry around a backpack, I don't wear shorts (protip: dress well!), and I only carry around a camera when I know I'm out to take pictures.
3.  Building on Point 2, luckily for me I have the luxury of forgoing a backpack as a semipermanent resident here.  For you, the backpack is where you keep your stuff when you're going places.  Money and passport should be securely tucked away DEEP in your bag, or carried in a pouch under your clothing.
4.  Most big European cities are like this.  (Not so much London, though.)  I was in Paris last week, had just arrived.  Had a HUGE backpack on.  Gypsy girl targeted me with a petition.  I *immediately* checked my vicinity for suspicious accomplices.  Read the petition, sure enough, it was a plea to donate to a school of deaf-mutes (lolnope).  In the same trip, a guy tried to pull the ring scam on me, featured in the video.  ""Oh, you just *found* a ring right in front of me, while I was eating my lunch?  Good for you!  Now fuck off.""
5.  Final point is a bit prejudiced, but it'll protect you: stay the fuck away from Gypsies.  Their culture teaches them to socially partition Gypsies from non-Gypsies and to take advantage of the latter for personal gain.  City Gypsies *will* try to profit by your good-natured ignorance.  If one approaches you (anyone, really), you keep moving and ignore them.

I hope you can move past this incident.  Madrid really is a lovely city!  If there's anything else you'd like to know, please, don't hesitate to ask

Suppose shops A and B are tax-evading, while honest shop C is paying taxes normally.  Since A and B have lower costs, they can also sell at lower prices that will eventually drive shop C out of business.  In a way, shop C will not survive, unless it evades taxes.  This is a variant of what is called ""tragedy of commons"", and the same applies to bribing, etc.
  
There is also the matter of ethics.  Even honest people are reluctant to pay taxes when they do not trust that the government will spend them wisely, which also creates a vicious circle, since the government needs to compensate for tax-evasion with even more taxes.  These typically affect people who already pay their taxes properly, since the government is finding it much easier (in the short run) to impose more taxes than catching those who evade them.

The first season consists just of 7 episodes (as you may know when you just watched it) because of the writer's strike that year, so that may be a reason why the first season seems not that good ( I watched the first season some years ago and really recall how good it really is). 

&gt;I really like the character Walt, he is this strange combination of push over and total bad ass

Yeah he was a good guy all of his life, is a likable. But also seen as too weak by some, maybe even by himself. I don't want to give too much away, but the major theme of the show is that Walt experiences what it is like to be bad man, and maybe he even likes it.

&gt;(I thought I'd indulge your Gerald Butler mancrush here)

And I thank you for that. Now I have something to drool about while I try to fight my hangover because of yesterday's football match.",0,1339330850,null,0,false,0,c4ynm4m,t3_unsc7,t1_c4ynm4m,t1_c4yl6gu,null,1429109476,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

This is just one up on categorising every social policy on a single Left-Right continuum. It's an unhelpful way of thinking (that L-R continuum derives from the seating arrangments in the French Revolutionary assembly, by the way).

If you're socially liberal but economically _classical liberal_ and mildly Eurosceptic then your nearest party in the UK is the BNP, according to this. This is utter, utter nonsense.

From ""Greece"" as country within the EU (and as political entity) and from ""Greece"" as general mentality and fiscal education concept to ""you"" as a person and Reddit user - well, it's a very, very long way.

If you would stop thinking like this and at least trying to have the overall image of you being guilty of either electing the wrong representatives or you being guilty of not obeying to the rules your own state imposed, then you will get my meaning and you will see where you (this time as a country) are wrong. Until then, good luck with screwing up!

You simply *cannot* deny the evidence of the fact that your elected representatives shamelessly lied to the EU regarding the country's financial status. And **this** is one of the reasons why Germany can borrow with small rates and Greece doesn't. Because Germany keeps its (financial) promises and Greece doesn't. Greece is simply not trustworthy and cannot guarantee with too much: I, for one, wouldn't accept tourism and olives as a guarantee. I would instead accept a solid credit history.

NB: Please try to read ""Greece"" and ""Germany"" not as ""you"" and ""me"". We're nothing in this equation and you know it, you're just like being passive-aggressive and - as I said - just cry loud. Just stop and try to find the real reason for all this.

true,bluemdown,IREL,Ireland,"&gt;No. I feel no affinity to other Europeans except maybe the British to some extent

Fair enough I agree that most Irish people would feel an affinity with the British than any other European nation/group. But...

&gt; Especially not countries who fought for independence, just to hand it all over again? 

Is this not a perfect example of unity being an amazing force in Europe ESPECIALLY considering our particular two nations bitter history. 

Even after independence Ireland and the UK had their own little unofficial union going on which has been massively beneficial to both countries. Even with the troubles and the fact that past UK leaders did some pretty awful things in Northern Ireland and the IRA in turn did some incredibly awful things again in Northern Ireland and in British cities we both still manage to have a deep affinity and like for one another. 

Also the majority of Irish media apart from print and radio is sourced from either Britain or the USA, not including national news and Ireland hasn't lost what makes it Irish.

While I understand your sentiment, I feel your argument supporting it is contradictory and can actually be used to illustrate how European nations can come together in unity despite the differences they have had.

It would seem that all over the EU, certain countries have some screwed up policies in various fields.. the EU is just one of those cases where many different countries which are flawed in their own ways get together and on average get the right decision made, therefore making it -- on average again -- better than each individual country that is part of it. Again, a couple of the countries like for example the scandinavian ones, may in fact be slightly superior to the EU on average, but the rest of them just **aren't** -- not even close.

The EU is not without its own issues in the way it's run, but we're all certainly much better off because of it existing rather than if it didn't.

..but to claim that such a massive project such as the EU has cult followers because they support a concept much better than racism and ""we're better than everyone else""... look, at the end of the day.. some people like the EU and some people don't.. some people like coca cola and some people like pepsi... just because someone doesn't have the same opinion as another person, it doesn't make their opinion wrong in any way -- just as your opinion of the EU being some kind of evil cult thing may not be wrong from your perspective.

Alchimie d’ombre e di luci
Nelle opere di Margaret Karapetian d'Errico le emozioni emergono dal groviglio di scalfitture e dai colori trasparenti che lasciano intravvedere la sensibilità di un’artista raffinata, di grandi capacità interpretative unite a quelle della realizzazione tecnica perfetta. I suoi segni, che scolpiscono le ombre per far scoprire le luci, creano mappe dell’animo in climi efficaci e di grande malia. Sono segni incisi con forza, che si sono specchiati nei materiali sino a riemergere, nei bianchi fogli, in alchimie di racconti meravigliosi che trovano origine nell’inconscio. Sono le ombre luciferine della notte che s’illuminano in un incendio nel bosco e fanno udire il grido della natura, degli alberi che ancora innalzano i loro neri rami infuocati tinti da bagliori di rosso, mentre le sfumature di speranza si sono perse nelle fiamme di morte. I colori bruni che hanno aloni di malinconia vengono rischiarati, flebilmente, da piccole chiazze di chiaro che non riescono a dar gioia. Le linee dritte di percorsi verso il cielo sono il racconto di un’invocazione d’aiuto, una richiesta di una moltitudine di vita che si stringe sempre più a se stessa come se le mancasse l’aria, come se lo spazio e il tempo stessero svanendo nelle superficialità dell’egoismo dell’uomo. Il paesaggio marino riverbera di luci Selene che dall’acqua vanno nella campagna sino a creare un clima d'incanto romantico. I viluppi di una rete colma, trascinata stancamente da un pescatore, curvo in avanti, diventato ombra, descrivono la paziente perizia con cui l’artista ha intessuto i segni della sua narrazione. Rosseggiano le tinte del sole fra le fronde velando i verdi di grigio e nell’incipiente della notte lunare ombre argentee vestono il bosco di malinconia. È giorno. I climi dolci delle colline toscane si raccontano nelle tonalità verdi che si armonizzano alle campiture delle terre, sono descritti dai segni dell’artista che, nell’incisione delle sue sensazioni, ha ritrovato i ritmi del vivere. L’Arno, che va di ponte in ponte, nella bruma delle goccioline, assume il profilo della storia e dell’arte di Firenze in un’alchimia d’impressioni che si sfocano nelle venature di trasparenze nebulose. Nello specchio lagunare leggere increspature schiumose, di movimenti lenti, spruzzano di luce i fondali creando un’atmosfera di serenità malinconica scaturita da un dialogo fra l’animo di Margaret e le sue tecniche d’incisione che denotano una profonda spiritualità.

At first, it's kind of weird to go alone, but i'm sure you will make friends really fast. Everyone is super kind. 

Second, southside camping  is on a runway of an airport. So make sure you are resitant against strong winds.

Third, bring apples, bread, salami and ham and stuff. Or you bring cans of conserverd food, like corn or pies. A good thing is a camp cooker, too. You can heat the cans directly on it, and the cartridges are pretty cheap. And of course a grill with some bratwurst.

Fourth, there is a strong security force, guarding the camping places and most of the people are really gentle. But on the last day, some strange people ilegally enter the camping places and take everything that's not fix.

I'd love to be there as well, but one festival a month is enough.

true,awildturtok,null,null,"I'm not going myself, but I was 2 years ago and friends of mine were last year, and I have some festival experience.

So what do you need:

* Southside is infamous for picking THE weekend, where it's raining and raining and raining...  Because of that: Get some fucking [Rubber Boots](http://www.mode.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/gummistiefel.jpg). You don't know how important it is. If you have none, buy them for ~20€, that should suffice. OR bring some hikingboots, they are good aswell and much more convenient, but aswell much more expensive.

* Buy canned food, like beans and soup and spaghetti etc. 2-3 cans per day should suffice

* Bring bread and some Pfefferbeisser aswell, if you're in a hurry or just in between.

* Buy a gas-cooker to heat your food or ask some people around you, if you can heat your food on theirs 90% of the people there will have one.

* 2 T-Shirts, 2 pairs of Jeans and one pair of shorts is enough. Pack them in Plastic Bags so they don't get wet in your tent. Bring one extra bag for your dirty clothes. 

* People sometimes/always will run around and scavenge for unattended things, they won't jump into your tent, but your chair seems to be pretty comfortable ;)

* Rape etc. is not a common thing, BUT you should always be at least a bit suspicious about people offering you drinks etc. (A female friend of mine once was drugged, nothing bad but weird)

* Store your money in uncommon places(I sometimes put ~10€ into my shoes/socks while wearing them)

* Bring at least 2-3L of non-beer drinks, a festival with a hangover is normal but not fun.

* You won't be sleeping too much. You'll probably get to bed at 3AM and wake up at about 8AM

* Don't go showering, it's a waste of time - you could've spent getting laid/seeing a band

* Condoms Condoms Condoms. I did not get laid on a festival, but it's common there. A friend of mine managed to get a girl with ""He Püppschen, Schöne Haare""(Which is kind of sad tbh)

* Bring a sleeping pad/Isomatte.

* Toilets are cleaned between 7 to 8AM and then never again till the next morning, so if you need to poop or can't piss whilst standing, go then.(I'm not sure if they have clean toilets to pay for, but some festivals have for about 1€)

* If you want to see a band and they are ""big"" go early. Maybe go watch the show of the previous band. You'll be much closer to the stage.

* The audience can be fucking brutal. When the big acts are playing, it can get extremely dense and uncofident in there people will push and pull, sometimes hurt you.

* Take care of Moshpits. They are fun and not that dangerous as they seem(I sometimes feel safer in there as in the crowd), but if you're not ""prepared"" be cautious.(No elbows; Protect your face with your arms)

* There is ambulance, but as you'd expect in a 70k audience of drunkards they can get irritated pretty fast. Try to be nice and they'll be too.

* Bring sunscreen, maybe.

It's just a splinter party nowadays, but I'm guessing their history goes back to the pre-war days when a swathe of French politics was dominated by the Radicals. The history of that political current goes back a long way, to the 19th century days of middle class and rural movements striving for reform but not revolution, and when the socialists and communists  emerged and grew, it was to the Radicals' left. By the 1930s the Radicals were an ideological mish-mash of local politicians with moderate center-left politics, a distaste for central authority and strong local ties, and being the party's leader was like herding cats. They don't really figure much in today's political landscape anymore - you have the PRG on the center-left, which is basically a somewhat centrist ally of the Socialists, and a small Radical party on the center-right which basically functions as a centrist ally of Sarkozy's UMP.

But let me rephrase my thoughts: If PASOK and ND can form a majority coalition, you have the main culprits of government failure at the reigns of Greece for the coming years. I think it would be good if this cycle is broken by forcing ND to form a coalition with Syriza. I have the hope (maybe naive, I don't know) that a) the presence of a newcomer will prevent that the traditional political families of Greece go back to business as usual, and b) that Syriza is not the irresponsible party their opponents are making it out to be (they certainly don't strike me as wacko's) and will adhere to most of EU's demands, if only after some hard re-negotiating of the terms and speed of austerity.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I'm a native English speaker who has had to learn a bit of Italian through necessity.  My observations:

  * It's much easier to read Italian than to understand it spoken (true for all languages, but written Italian is very easy to understand as an English speaker).  Italian vocabulary is quite easy to pick up, as many words are borrowed from English or share a common root with an English word (via Norman French).  A blind translation of Italian into English leads to some funny sentences, however, as mundane Italian words mean something very strong in English.  A good example of this is ""pericolo"", meaning some form of danger, related to ""peril"" in English, which is a much stronger word.
  * Italians speaking sound like machine guns being fired.  The sounds are ridiculously fast and despite living here for two years, nearly, I still have trouble following native speakers when they talk.  Add to that the crazy dialects, accents (locals pronounce all ""s"" sounds as ""sh"") and the habit of abbreviating things too.
  * Italian is extremely sensitive to correct placement of stress and clean vowel sounds.  I don't know why it appears to be so much more sensitive than what English appears to be, but if you put stress in the wrong place in a word or pronounce a vowel funny the whole of your sentence is essentially lost to native Italian speakers.
  * Conjugated verbs having different endings depending on the number, social rank or gender of the thing or person you are talking about.

Ugh. 

Zombie_Lenin, if you're still reading along, basically, a Dutch newspaper quoted some SP party bigwigs brainstorming about the possible wisdom of renaming the party ""Social Party"" instead of the current ""Socialist Party"" -- but when the story was published the party denied they were thinking about it, and said it had just been something that had come up ""several years ago"".

I mean, in a way, sure, it's true - the SP has long stopped being a proper socialist party the way that the PSP once used to be. Van Bommel is right that basically, the SP is now just saying what the Labour Party used to say, up til the 80s. They're basically just old school social-democrats now.

But still, changing your name and formally ditching your heritage that way ... it just screams ""sell-out"". It seems like totally the wrong signal to send if you're positioning yourself as the one remaining party that's still proudly left-wing.

I was already pretty unhappy with recent headlines about how the SP was letting it be known that everything would be negotiable if they were to be in government coalition talks ... I mean, I understand, they want to get their hands on the government steering wheel, so they can pass some laws they like. But if a Dutchman wants to vote for a party that will do anything just to get into government, he can already vote for the Green Left. 

The whole selling point of the SP has been that it's a voice for protest, that it talks for the regular guy, isn't part of the Hague elites. That's how they manage to win back some working class votes from the Freedom Party too, which is what a left-wing party should do, and which the Labour Party totally fails at. If they loudly declare in advance how they'll be eager to negotiate anything, why would you still vote for them?

as far as cell carriers, Wind and 3 are usually the cheapest, but they can have lousy reception in some areas. I was in Alghero a few years ago and had no problem with my Wind cell phone.
Besides, kepp in mind that many Italian don't have a cell phone plan but they just use a prepaid SIM card with an unlocked phone. It's cheap and allows you complete flexibility. This is why you also see many people with two cell phones or more. The way I see it, you only need a cell phone plan if you don't want to buy an expensive phone and want it to be subsidized by your carrier. Many people swiched to lately 3 because of their offer on iphones (34 euros/month with 100 minutes per week, per 30 months, and a free iphone)

En primer lugar, secundo la idea de *Familia* y *Los amantes del círculo polar*, y añado *Barrio*. Incluso *Lágrimas negras* si te gustó *La buena estrella*.

También falta algo de Calparsoro (tienes *Asfalto*, pero faltan *Salto al Vacío*, *Pasajes*...), y por supuesto -aunque no sea nuevo- toda la gran tradición española: Buñuel, Bardem, Berlanga, Ferrari... y José Luis Cuerda (*Amanece, que no es poco* es probablemente la mejor muestra y el epígono del humor absurdo de calidad español; *El Bosque Animado* tiene unas interpretaciones de lujo...)

Alguna otra que se echa en falta:

* Entre las ""algo antiguas"", *Los Santos Inocentes*.
* Entre las comedias modernas, el musical *El otro lado de la cama*, *Primos* o *Pagafantas*.
* En inglés, *Los Crímenes de Oxford* (De la Iglesia) o *El último viaje de Robert Rylands* (Gracia Querejeta).
* Cine catalán, cualquiera de Ventura Pons (desde la locura de *¿Qué te juegas, Mari Pili?* hasta *El porqué de las cosa*s, pasando por *Actrices*, etc.).
* Algún Albadalejo, como *El Cielo Abierto*.
* Mucho Bajo Ulloa (lo serio -*Alas de mariposa*, *La Madre Muerta*- y lo gamberro -*Airbag*, **hay que ver Airbag**-).
* El Uribe de *Días contados*, por ejemplo.
* El Bigas Luna de *Bilbao*.
* Esa maravilla de arte y ensayo de Zulueta que es *Arrebato* (no es del gusto de todos, eso sí).

It has a roaming agreement with TIM, however, so you will still be able to use the phone service at no extra charge. You'll get charged (heavily) for data in roaming. If you stay in Alghero you won't have problems, but outside you will (experienced that as a tourist).

You'll probably get the best coverage with TIM, but they are a tad more expensive and have weird limitations on data plan. One more thing: in northern Sardinia, on the coast, it can happen to pick up signals from Corsica, which is France. Do check that your phone hasn't suddenly switched to some French carrier, or you'll get a nasty surprise.

Concerning the other questions and, again, based on my tourist experience:

Sardinia sees a *lot* of activity during summer, with a consequent increase in connections and transport options, but can be much less active otherwise. If you intend to visit out of the way spots a car might be the only way.

Touristy places are used to foreign people, so you might find people who can understand English. Don't bet on it however, as Italy is notorious for poor knowledge of languages. Younger people are getting better at it, but older people that speak English definitely are are. Some rare people might even only speak Sardinian, which even Italians can't understand.

Also the continued lack of access to contraception/sex education in many parts of Eastern Europe is something that should be improved, but that would decrease birth rates and nationalists like high birth rates.

I can understand an argument about maximizing sustainable population growth, but the thing about arguing for the intrinsic immorality of abortion is that to be consistent you either have to argue that ""potential human life"" being prevented is bad (in which case every menstrual cycle is murder and rape is seemingly justifiable prevention of homicide) or you have to argue that fetal brain mass that is smaller and less developed than most livestock is more conscious (which doesn't seem scientifically feasible) and thus more important (unless you argue that the value of life comes from something other than conscious experience).",0,1339373186,null,0,false,0,c4yvczi,t3_tvvu8,t1_c4yvczi,t1_c4qd4po,null,1429113188,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

I hate to be in agreement with a policy the article identifies as right-wing, and perhaps I could be persuaded to change my mind, but a system of anonymous giving up of a child like this one seems the only way a parent wishing to get rid of a pregnancy eg due to social conditions could chose if the decision to do so has been made very late in pregnancy, say due to a sudden change of their situation, so that abortion is no longer an option.

Europe has a rather dark history as I'm sure you know. We've learned the hard way that nationalism and this continent does not mix well. Outside of very formal occasions there's a taboo on publicly displaying the local flag in many European countries because of the associations with nationalism and jingoism. It isn't exactly helped by the far right's appropriation of all things representative of their country as symbols for their own movement either.

It does *not* mean we hate our own countries or governments, only that overt symbols of national pride are for historical reasons a touchy subject.

&gt; This all has something to do with ""football"" or soccer?

Yes. For some reason the above mentioned historical taboos don't apply when it comes to sporting events and competitions and some people... let's just say they take their sports very seriously.

&gt; And you have non-profit (or financially inept) football teams who depend on contributions from people to support them?

It's not even just about the Nazis having taken it to the extreme, it's also that nationalism made it possible. Since then, most people here perceive it as a primitive instinct, as uncultivated behavior that people only fall back upon if they have no personal achievements of their own that they could be proud of.  
To a certain extend, this can be seen in some other European countries as well, but especially in Germany where any expression of national pride had been taboo for decades this sentiment is relatively common. If only the extreme right expresses national pride, then an association between expressions of national pride and right wing extremism develops naturally, and then it keeps reenforcing itself.

Sports are an exception, and flags have become socially acceptable especially in a football context. I'm convinced that there must be little kids out there who think it's just the colors of our national football team.

We don't hate our country but sometimes hate our government, depending on who's running it, what's being decided, and where we personally stand politically. Just like everybody else does all over the world. Nothing unusual here.

&gt; And you have non-profit (or financially inept) football teams who depend on contributions from people to support them?

The German football association has some rather restrictive regulations regarding the teams' finances, but in certain other major European leagues some billionaires keep teams as expensive hobbies.

AFAIK, tax payer support mainly comes in the form of costs for police around and during games, but at least in Germany, football related tax income far outweighs those costs.

&gt; We 'generally' see living here (and not being leftist, or another type of anti-American) as a good reason to wave the flag.

Well, everybody in the US is living there. Flags are symbols, symbols carry information, and in this case the information is zero. If you make inflationary use of it, it loses it's symbolic value, e.g., to mark official buildings, special dates, events and so on.  
You gave a great example of this effect. If displaying the flag is normal, the absence of it becomes a symbol in itself. In this case, it's Leftism or anti-Americanism. What's so bad about the US that you suspect your compatriots to hate it, unless they explicitly state otherwise? Don't you degrade showing the flag to an empty gesture if this behavior is the norm, and a mere fulfillment of expectations? (And why do you categorize Leftism as a form of anti-Americanism?)

My germanhood over everything,
My highest good in the world!
It is what makes me stand with the best in the world.
If i was not german, everything would be over;
It is an honor, that i am german.

My germanhood is my life,
it makes me happy and rich;
To the german essence, nothing on earth can compare!
One might ask scornful - is that not bragging?
What others say about it - i don't care.

I could not care less about the vermin, who don't want to be germans anymore, who cry: Pack your bags and return to the Rhine!
Those who stand proudly to their germanhood, those are not only german in germany, they are it in all the world.

Hitler and the Germans.

As long as he was successful,
the people bowed to him,
The Nazis cheered,
whenever the Führer showed himself.

The old flag - Black-White-Red,
blew proudly everywhere,
And hope, that hardship was over,
heightened the joy.

The shameful contrtact, which was forced on
germany in Verailles, was thrown out like a foul egg,
the contract was dead.

*Can't read* was again, like before, a part of the German Reiche, 
the stupid polish corridor was dead like *smudged*
Austria and Germany, paronymus, should now again walk together, hand in hand,
as faithful german brothers. All that was very nice and good, everyone liked it, people got courage by it and were happy. With that much was achieved, and if everyone had been content with that, quiet and piece would have been.
Alas, but alas, it did not come like that. Although hopeful, the punishment came, for failures which had been done.
And when in false security, Hitler thought himself victorious, he had half the world as enemy.
Italy, Russia,AFrika, the other countries all allied with America, they brought him down.

Not that I'm advocating a gold standard or anything, but you are off the mark as to why gold was used as a currency. It has several physical qualities that make it ideal:

1. It is durable - it doesn't react, degrade, oxidise, etc.

2. It is homogeneous - you can divide it up ad infinitum to create any denomination you want.

3. It is portable

4. It is hard to counterfeit - it's easily recognisable by the layman. This is a major reason why something like platinum isn't as good.

5. The supply of gold is pretty steady, therefore people have confidence in future costs, allowing the possibility of saving capital - the supply can only increase gradually as it is actually pretty hard to get out of the ground and isn't used in industry in any significant amount (mostly because of point 1). All of the gold ever mined would fit inside the Washington monument. 

&gt; Just look at what happened to the Spanish economy in the 18th century.

I want to also say that this family is anything but typical German, from my own experience. I've lived in the country 3 times now and this is the only family I know like this.

Pretzels are awesome. Butterbreze, a Pretzel with, you guessed it, butter, is awesome too. Such an easy snack.

Continuing the Pretzel worship, set aside a leisurly Saturday morning for a Weißwurstfrühstück. Basically, it's good bavarian beer, fresh Pretzels, traditional bavarian white [sausages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weisswurst), and sweet mustard. Yum. Be aware that zuzeln (sucking out the meat) is the way they are meant to be eaten, but most nonbavarians will resort to cutting them open and eating them like civilized beings, much to our dismay. Tch.

Also, Pretzels come in two variations. The vastly superior one uses coarse salt, while the heathen abomination defiles your taste buds with finely ground salt. 

There's also Kastanien, or Brezensemmeln, a delicious crossbreed with buns using the latest Pretzel technology and finest ingredients to give you the best of both worlds. 

Also, MEAT. Ente mit Blaukraut, Gänsebraten, ~~Schweinebraten~~ Schweinsbraten mit Kartoffelknödel, Krustenbraten in Dunkelbiersauce mit Sauerkraut, and if you truly find a Good (yes, *G*ood) restaurant and are feeling adventurous, then give Kutteln or Saures Lüngerl mit Semmelknödeln a try. Warning, the last two use offal.
