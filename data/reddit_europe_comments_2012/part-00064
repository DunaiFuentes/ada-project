&gt; Lagard, head of the IMF, is by law exempted from paying taxes. You think that's a bad thing? Fine, vote for a party that promises to change the tax statute of diplomats next time you get a chance.

Many of us do. Where do we present our ""Tax Diplomats"" badge, in order to be able to criticise this ""law""? 

As I said earlier, many people wouldn't want to be reminded of some perfectly ""legal"" historical examples.

&gt; It would be hypocritical if she were evading taxes.

Because, you know, there is no logical fallacy behind the ""it's legal, it's fine"" premise. All laws are inherently just, and who are we to question the establishment? Martians? Communists? Antilopes?

&gt; the argument here is that, somehow, the fact that her tax status is different from that of most Greek citizens, she's barred from opining on their tax morale.

No, this is not the argument here. Other people understood it.

true,W00ster,NORW,Norway,"Well, I have some interesting experiences work wise with Southern Europe and I can say it is in general, a very negative view of efficiency.  
  
Example:  
Many years ago, I was going to set up a private network between Norway and Spain based upon IBM's Token Ring network over ISDN lines. I set up and tested the Norwegian side then set off to Spain. The Spanish phone company, Telefonica, had installed the ISDN connections so it was working. The problem was the cables we got from Telefonica. They were 3 meters in length but I needed several longer ones, up to 10 meters and when I asked the Telefonica guy to get me some longer cables, he coudln't - he only had pre-cut cables. So I asked to get some longer cables made and after a day without any cables, I called and asked where they were. He told me they had to come from Madrid, this was in Malaga and it would take 4 - four- days! Pissed off around 4 in the afternoon, I called my Norwegian supplier and gave him the details. No problems - he'd make me any length i needed, had them shipped with DHL and arrived before 10AM next morning in Malaga. Around 11 the Telefonica guy called and wanted to know if I needed the cables - told him I had gotten what I needed overnighted from Norway so thanks but no thanks!  
  
Now, you may imagine this was a one off situation but the office we installed in needed to get the water heater functioning and it needed an airhose from the burner to the wall outlet to let out steam and it was one of those accordion type hoses. Also pre-cut so when I asked the guy to go back out to his car and cut a longer one, he only had pre-cuts and it took us three fucking days to get a simple hose cut to the correct length. It's a fucking nightmare!  
  
I have no idea how businesses survives in these countries, nobody is doing anything and the nothing they are doing is taking an excessive amount of time! I could only get hold of my Telefonica contact between 10AM and 2PM. At 2PM, he took siesta and he was never available AFTER the siesta.

* In Nord America c'è il cosiddetto *tipping out*. In pratica i camerieri pagano una percentuale del prezzo pagato dal cliente allo staff della cucina, del bar, e così via. Si tratta di pochi punti percentuale, ma se non dai la mancia, il cameriere in America o in Canada ci rimette molto spesso di tasca sua. In Italia questo concetto non esiste. Al più si dividono equamente le mance.
* Anche in Nord America, la mancia che si aspettano i camerieri è il 15% e non il 20% riportato dall'articolo.
* È davvero poco carino far sapere al mondo cosa hanno mangiato i due, per fare pubblicità al locale nei giornali. Non so in Italia, ma qui la considererebbero una violazione della loro privacy.

No.
There are conflicting opinions about certain issues (with regard to the Greek ""crisis"").
Tsipras has the right to side with either of those.
The journalist, however, is not supposed to side with one of those opinions.
Even more so, mock the interviewee because they don't like him.
That's what it looks like to me anyway.
Fortunately, his keeping calm and answering politely makes the journalist seem a little bit rabid.

For instance: *""SPIEGEL: Mr. Tsipras, is Berlin really as bad as you always say back home in Athens whenever you rail against the evil Germans?""*
What, if not provocative, is the purpose of the opening question?
By the way, Tsipras has *never ever* accused the German people.
To the contrary, Syriza always says that people should not hate one another and so on.
He criticizes certain policies, not the people.
This interview is a bad joke.

And it was in Belgium, in the very heart of the continent.

I know there's an opinion, that Poland and Ukraine are racist and xenophobic. Let me then direct you to the ""Human Library"" event, which had it's sixt edition this year. Basically you just go to the specific library where there are ""uncommon"" people, like gay, atheist, real catholic, a lesbian, a hobo, former drunk, priest, former prisoner, a black person, and you can talk about anything with anyone youy want. Sort of live action AMA. And let me tell you, the two gays they've got this year where not among the most popular ""books"", because they were not any ""uncommon"" or ""exotic"" to people. A former prisoner was the most popular, followed by a guy who walks in high heels and wears skirts (I shit you not, he works on a University). 

[Here's their TED talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TK9OTC17Cfk)

But form what I've heard, they've tried to do same thing in other cities, and there were people suggesting, that having a gay or a lesbian is a bit too extreme. So maybe it's just a Wrocław thing. I could elaborate on why I think that may be a local thing, but I might be boring you at this point.

I think this comes from a misunderstanding. We tend to think of the US as a similar culture (""The West""), and they fail to live up to certain expectations that we take for granted. How can somebody doubt the self-evident truth that the right to universal health care should be held as unalienable?  
If we would look at them as a different culture, they're fine. They have a free press, they can choose between more than one party, the average standard of living is high and they will probably treat you in a medical emergency. They make cool TV shows. They have a few problems, but they're actually doing quite well, relatively speaking, it's just that the expectations are different.

A wider issue is whether A) one is morally obliged to pay taxes when one is legally obliged to pay taxes, and if so B) does the nullification of the legal obligation remove one’s moral obligation. I don’t think A) is correct, but certainly I think B) is much less correct. Morality exists outside the law.

It might be prohibited, but no one cares. The police passed us a few times and they couldn't care less about someting minor like that.

I'd say set up the tent, if anyone complains let her sleep in the RV.

About the fees: There are no addtional fees, IF you have a ticket for each person. Otherwise you are not allowed into the parking lot.

Quoting an [old comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/sy9u9/why_low_minimum_wages_kill_jobs_and_crush_living/c4i39ct) again, which was written for an american.

Germany per se has no minimum wage. But Unions of specific Industrial sectors negotiate for minimum wage all the time. During the recession, the government asked the factories to not fire the workers, but instead retain them on lower pays. Some of the balance, of the negotiated minimum wage, was instead paid by the government as social security payments. Thus, German manufacturing was able to recover from the recessions very fast. And post recovery, the government stopped paying the factory workers additional money on top of their wages.

Now consider the unorganized service sector of Germany. Without a minimum wage, this sector offers lower priced services. Which keeps living costs down for others (from factory workers to suits). But this also means low wages for this unorganized sector. So what the government does is, that if you earn very low, then you will get additional welfare payments from the government. So you essentially have a minimum wage from the perspective of the low wage earners. And the living costs of society at large is lower.

On top of this, Germans don't pick up loans or credit as fast as Americans. So the housing/rental market doesn't rape you in the butt.

Now this is complicated. Americans would have trouble implementing this whole system. But Germans being Germans, love complicated efficient schemes which they happily implement. And it has worked out for them.

Though there is a demand for higher taxes at the top and more wages at the bottom, overall I would say Germans have a lot of margin of error. They can simply up their social security payments and still continue to have a solid manufacturing base.

Now only if Germans worked out a better birth rate...",0,1338347696,null,0,false,0,c4txti1,t3_ua96a,t1_c4txti1,t1_c4tx088,null,1429027639,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

America has a similar but crueler solution.  In this country, service workers like waiters are paid between 2 and 3 dollars per hour, with the expectation that these workers will get their true wage from tips.  If a worker's tips do not average out to him earning minimum wage ($7.25) per hour, then his employer is supposed to make up the difference.  I think that most employers break that law by not making up the difference.

So rather than having the low wages compensated by the state, America relies on the generosity of paying customers to directly pay the difference between what these workers actually make (about $2.50/hr) and minimum wage.  To be fair, waiters can make a lot of money a night from tips if they work at a nice restaurant (several hundred $ per night is not that rare).

The price of food is also kept down by the custom of using illegal migrant labor from Mexico and Latin America to pick crops and work in meat factories.

&gt;Americans would have trouble implementing this whole system.

We would have trouble severing our government's reliance on borrowed money.  Frankly, we shouldn't stop borrowing money, because it allows us to stimulate the economy during hard times without raising taxes, which would deepen a recession.  But I definitely think we should borrow *less* and tax a bit more, so that we are not borrowing and printing such vast sums of money.

&gt;there is a demand for higher taxes at the top

That is because the American people tend to have a ""live and let live"" attitude, which translates to a reflexive isolationism when it comes to foreign affairs.  The idea of withdrawing US troops from foreign nations is very popular; Americans also favor ending all or most foreign aid.

Our government's policies, however, are the exact opposite: it intrudes as much as possible in the affairs of all the nations.  So Americans shake their heads and think, ""That is one area of politics that we cannot control; the government will continue to involve us in every foreign dispute no matter what we think.""

That is why the US government works so hard to demonize our ""enemies,"" like Iran: unless Americans think a foreign power is a literal, immediate threat to us, there will not be enough public support for a conflict with them.

On the one hand, yes, Germany does provide housing, education, food and medical care to all people, by the means of a social program called Hartz4, which gurantees every person ~360€/month plus ""rent for an adequate flat"". What is adequate is different from town to town, and you are only eglible for Hartz4 after you sold anything you owned before, even after losses, which can in certain constellations destroy your retirement funds.

Hartz4, however, is designed to make people work, and when there is no work, you get some kind of weird Stanford Prison Experiment style management, with the social workers forcing people through all kinds of hoops - they do have the power to stop providing social security monies, e.g. deprive people of housing and food, and that happens frequently for things like ""has not shown up at an appointment we set a day before"", just because they can.

In reality, the relative wealth of the population has decreased ever since we started our austerity measures, especially the very poor (whose social security was massively cut when we enacted Hartz4.

Hartz4 should make us angry, very angry, but in reality the media has created an air of ""unemployed people are responsible for their own plight"", and they have become convinient scapegoats for our society's woes.

Fondamentalement, vous me semblez être pris dans une relation amour-haine très toxique dans laquelle se mêlent notamment mépris, fascination et mépris de soi d'être fasciné par l'autre.

J'ai par exemple toujours été surpris par la virulence du discours anti-américain en France, discours qui cohabite dans les faits avec une forte attirance pour tout ce qui est d'outre-atlantique. Pareillement, si le mépris envers les Français est sans conteste palpable aux États-Unis (je le sens parfois dès que j'y parle français), la France continue d'y incarner la Culture, la classe et la distinction. 

Ces rapports sont particulièrement patents dans vos cinématographies respectives. Les comportements de vos élites, par exemple leur rapport à l'éducation, me semblent aussi être très révélateurs. Tandis que leurs parents expriment ouvertement leur aversion pour l'Autre république et ses citoyens, les gosses de riches continuent d'être formés par des institutions singeant en grande partie celles de leur grand ""frenemy"".

true,umman,null,null,"Für mich hört sich das nach dem üblichen Gejammer an welches man im Moment überall im linken(/rechten) Lager vernimmt. Es ist natürlich intelektuell verpackt. Da hat man ja durch die passende Ausbildung schon was gelernt. Am Ende bleibt aber nichts weiter übrig ausser das was die Massenmedien den Piraten sowieso schon vorwerfen. Kein Plan, Verwertungsrechte abschaffen, etc.

Es scheint aber dann in den Seitenhieben der tatsächliche Frust über das eigene Versagen durch. Klar fangen die Piraten nun auch Wutbürger ab. Als das die Linke oder die Grünen gemacht haben und sich somit ihren falschen Aufwind verschafft haben, war es noch revolutionär und ein solch hohes Ziel. Die Wutbürger sind weg und zurück blieben nur die üblichen unwählbaren Freaks mit ihren internen Problemen. Unwählbar für Sinn und Verstand.

Die Wahrheit ist jedoch, daß beide durch sind. Die Grünen sind inzwischen nicht mehr der Rede wert (eigentl. seit dem Krieg in Jugoslavien). Sie hatten ihren letzten Aufwind nach Fukushima aber wer auf die Nummer reingefallen ist, der lässt sich auch gegen die Vogelgrippe impfen. S21 hat die Folgen nochmal in klein demonstriert. Die Linke hatte eine tatsächliche Chance. Man kann aber nicht wirklich ewig verstecken was tief in einem wirklich krank ist. Es kommt irgendwann mal wieder raus. Siehe katholische Kirche. So haben wir heute einen Haufen von exKadern, Wannabe-Marxisten und einfach nur Arschlöchern die sich intern gegenseitig bespitzeln, bekämpfen und alle eigentlich nach einem Führer rufen den sie nicht haben. All das auf Basis einer Ideologie die schon mehrmals gezeigt hat wie undurchsetzbar und/oder falsch ist.

Es sind aber auch nicht nur die Parteien. Es sind genauso die veralteten Ideen die ausser bei der eigenen verblendeten Gemeinde niemanden mehr anzieht. Das gilt hierbei genauso für die Rechten oder die ""Neuen Rechten"". Alles Relikte einer unaufgeklärten Zeit die solch hirnrissige Utopien noch möglich machte. 

Niemand will heute noch den Kommunismus. Es ist auch Schwachsinn in einer globalisierten Welt den Nationalismus zu prädigen. Das erkennen auch die eigenen Mitglieder so langsam. Deswegen treten sie aus. Nicht weil sie denken, daß sie dort ihre Ziele aus der alten Partei verwirklichen können, wie der Autor das andeutet. Nein, sie treten aus weil sie sehen, daß man bei der PP vielleicht tatsächlich die gesetzten Ziele verwirklichen kann. Das gleiche gilt auch für die Freiheit oder Transparenz hier im Artikel. Jeder predigt Freiheit und Transparenz. Seit Jahrzehnten. Durch alle Lager hindurch. Dennoch machte es keiner. Die Leute waren abgestumpft. Jetzt gibt es wieder Hoffnung und das reicht oft genug aus. Es ist auch nicht zu wenig. Die Leute wissen, und die PP sagt es auch, selbst wenn sie nicht an die Macht kommen sollten besteht eine hohe Chance darauf, daß ihre Ziele von anderen Parteien aufgegriffen werden. Einfach nur weil sich ein Druck aufbaut. Ein Druck den heut zu Tage weder Links noch Rechts aufbauen können. Diese zwei Seiten haben in den letzten 30 Jahren dafür gesorgt, daß in vielen Bundesländern die Nichtwähler die Regierung stellen sollten. Das ist ihre einzige Leistung. Good Job.

Es ist Zeit für etwas neues. Weit ab von Links und Rechts. 

...daß das den Linken und Rechten Angst macht, kann ich gut verstehen. Etwas mehr Klartext dazu würde ihnen auch nicht schaden.

Nebenbei ist es witzig wie zum Ende des Artikels der Autor in sein altes Vokabular verfällt. Man kann den Kader raushören im Kader.

I mean you don't get the clever folks form Istanbul, they stay at home because they can make good money home. You get the people from some ass-backwards little village in Anatolia, where people can hardly read and write. 

This is natural and it is not racist or xenophobical to say this: there are really differences _inside_ less developed countries, and said countries often tend to export the least successful of their population because the more succesful often feel OK staying home. 

As an educated Hungarian living abroad I feel often ashamed for other Hungarians I meet here - they are often so dumb that I never knew and never imagined to exist growing up in the cozy, educated Budapest suburbia. Probably they are from some really backwards village or collapsed industrial town.

This can be objectively measured by the skills people have regarding their own native language. Can they understand an average work of literature from their own country? No? Then of course they will do piss poor at school learning in a foreign language - and their kids won't have it easy either.

We must also understand that Turkey, Arab countries etc. are _extremely hierarchical and unequal_. There, educating the general population esp. villagers was never a priority: they simply poured excellent education on the urban middle-class, who are high in the hiearchy, and they got really good, but they did not give two fucks about educating the average peasant.

But generally I think in life a persons own motivation matters more than external circumstances or luck - in getting rich perhaps not but in making a basic good living yes. So you must treat a very, very careful line of not being too cruel and not being too accomodating and demotivation. Guaranteeing poor people basic necessities but then motivating them rather hard (tough management, shaming) sounds like an ideal compromise. 

Or at any rate I don't know what the ideal compromise is. The UK or Austria or California basically giving people money no questions asked is really too accomodating, OTOH no welfare at all might be too cruel. Yours sounds ideal. In Austria I hear people saying stuff like ""Why should I go to work when I get €700 anyway"", and this is what I call too accomodating.

As for jobs... I personally think jobs must not rain down like magic from government or rich people. People, everyday people must create jobs, not just sit around and wait for others to give them jobs. Start self-employment, small business, some of them grows big etc. Of course it is very important that the regulatory environment should be flexible with micro-business. I would say the first €15K per year earned by self-employment should be entirely untaxed, unaccounted for, unreported. This would help a lot for the start.

Thus, they remained deprived of their rights and subject to specific segregation such as not being allowed to dwell or acquire houses in the cities, to build stone churches, or enjoy fair justice. Several examples of legal decisions taken by the three nations some hundred years after Unio Trium Nationum (1542–1555) are illustrative: the Romanian could not appeal to justice against Hungarians and Saxons, but the latter could turn in the Romanian (1552); the Hungarian (Hungarus) accused of robbery could be defended by the oath of the village judge and three honest men, while the Romanian (Valachus) needed the oath of the village knez, four Romanians and three Hungarians (1542); the Hungarian peasant could be punished after being accused by seven trustworthy people, while the Romanian received punishment after he was accused by three trustworthy people (1554).

For a while now, several Redditors maintain that ""what is legal is ethical"", ""what is decided is just"", ""whoever is on top makes the decisions"", ""the one with the money decides, others follow"" and so on. In our case, if it's good for Germany, surely, it should be good and just for others. But if it doesn't serve Germany's interests, despite Germany's actions, it's unjust and should be scrapped.

Eventually, you have to decide if you're going to have two value systems; one for you, and one for the others. If Germany believes in the principle ""pacta sunt servanda"", then why complain? Because Germany signed an ""unjust"" deal, that was imposed by others who called the shots? But this is exactly what Germany does right now. It shoves ""pacta sunt servanda"" down to Greece's throat, while the German-imposed program is a complete and utter failure, a total waste of money, impossible to complete in such a short period (even for Germany), and a danger for the whole of the EU.

Industrialization/modernization is not an inevitability. It depends on:

a)having people skilled in technical subject(s), with a tendency towards fiddling 

b)having financial backers, with enough capital, an interest in the subject and a desire to take risks.

c)having low cultural and organizational barriers towards inter-personal communication 


c)having a society in which business failure is not a sin

d)having a market that uses profits for improvement rather than funneling towards their owners pockets

If you read biographies of notable men you'll find there is a pattern to their histories, families tend to prosper together (Bernoulli, Nobel), educations paths tend to converge, their backers tend to be similar, things like the Scottish Enlightenment happen in bursts. Most notably, these men do not usually come from the working class, since it's hard to be productive on your own after giving most of your energy towards your work,  know the sort of people which could help you in a business proposal if you never get to meet them, or have enough money to toy with ideas yourself if you're concerned with food.

Organization of society can redistribute wealth, adjust expectations, allow for development of marketplaces of ideas and encourage self-improvement (similar to the Puritans or Huguenots).

The only thing they have to think about is how much you can default -- and also to whom in particular -- to still be able to lend money.

In the end, I'd say put the defaulting on hold until you've got, modulo the interest payments, a solid and stable budget surplus. Because having that, they can default on everything without caring about your credit rating as there won't be any need for credit.

THE ACQUITTAL

The real irony of the fall was the timing. In my class
was the historical task of building the previous week on the morning of the 10th
November 1989: ""Justify that the anti-fascist protective wall
still has its place! ""
Iam erat quod non demonstrandurn.
I also had two days earlier had no suitable explanation.
At least I would have done anything to make any need.

I knew long ago that I would not hold the wall thereof,
leave. My plans for the East was too small. I dreamed of
Paris and New York. I wanted to study, see the world. I had
not want to be one of the university referenced dissident - I
know too many smart people who raked graves in cemeteries. I
Wanted to go to France, the motherland of the revolution.
I had planned my departure for about a year exactly. It
was no leak. My strategy was simple: to finish school,
Foreigners married to leave on family reunification.
I had two realistic options: my school friend, Robert,
of a French father and had just graduated from high school here
waited, or Eric from Marseille I in the summer holidays
the Baltic Sea had learned to know. It was a matter of time. Robert
in May 1990 was of legal age, Eric in August.
By marriage with a foreigner, I would certainly GDR citizen
remained, which meant not to say that she left me again purely
had. The people who were my family belonged to the east,
all within the circle of expressly unwanted people. The
People who would have taken me to the west, were 
reported and rausgeekelte GDR citizens. No optimal 
conditions for a permanent visa. It was the price of my freedom.
My problem was not the question of how to escape from the East
My problem was how do I tell my parents
It was the biggest con? Ict of my youth. I could not bring
ready to confess to them what was fixed. That I take this country to
soon as possible and would leave the fight in the East
abandoned for a degree and a passport. I was sure it would
they kill.

With the fall of 1989, leaving all of my plans were rendered obsolete. When Robert
was eighteen War, no more talk of escape.
The years went by, I could study and we are familiar
to living in the West. In spring 1995 I visited with a
Swedish friend of my parents. We sat in the living room, tran-
ken red wine and told him funny stories from the GDR.
Suddenly he asked me what I should have been done, the wall would be
do not like. I had answered this question a hundred times.
I just wanted to start, when I suddenly an almost forgotten lump
felt in the neck. He threatened to suffocate me. Feelings of guilt.
I realized that this was the moment my parents to gesture-
, hen that I had left it. Six years had passed, and we
had not talked about it once. What would have happened
when? We had hidden the topic easily. It was taboo.
I felt like I was suddenly a teenager again and I do not
allowed to feel just that I wanted to get away from the East that
not my life in the GDR opposition proceed dignity. I
was a deserter. I told all the people who were important to me,
because I was not willing to stay here. But I already knew that
the fate of a martyr was nothing for me. I wanted to think
and write, not to learn pottery. My target was the university,
and there was no alternative.
I would have given anything that came along my parents. But
this was not an option. They would have stayed. Against all modes of
common sense. Of principle.
But I, her child, I was no better than the other, the land
abandoned. But I could not stand it anymore that is prescribed by,
what can I do to, and had to read. I hated the small-mindedness
the GDR, these bigoted madness, set up between Wandlitz
and Western television. Out of sheer shame I projected my time
all longing for freedom in a concrete Wanderlust: France.
I thought it was a difference. I thought if I Wegheirate,
then it would have a different weighting than one exit visa. I
never wanted to West Germany or in another part of Berlin.
I wanted another country. It was my form of loyalty
over the country from which I came to the people,
who had raised me, not against principles
mine were, but were stuck with, like an artificial joint. I
was not a typical East German child, but I was a wholly owned
Reformkornmunistischer product ideas. Because I am always the East
had to make a speech about, I needed a rest from ideal. I wanted


There was something good in the East, that they had anything in itself,
I could understand as a sign of reconciliation, something that we
Germany differed from the other positive. I was rock solid as-
from convinced that it was simply wrong, and that Honecker
this system, it would be great if just once and Stalinism
outgrown the blessing would be communism. With all the
Radicalness of my youth, I thought we were going to change the GDR
can. But I also knew I was a diplomat for allenfals
Disposal. I already knew that it was self-deception, but I wanted to
The truth does not know. Just because I have the DDR better than the
Most of their peers did, I always underestimated.
I probably would at some point later to West Berlin
and would have drawn, it is often, standing at Checkpoint Charlie
and looked over the wall back home. One day I was in the
Landwehr Canal bound by twisted out of sheer loneliness. In the
Grabe agree with Rosa Luxembourg, probably closer to me in exile
would have been a lot of Kreuzberg.
My parents were waiting. It was time to tell it to them. I took
my courage and said, barely audible: ""I would be in the
West gone. ""Then I looked at her. My mother had a hand
my father took. He cleared his throat softly. Mom started
to speak choked voice: ""We have always known that you
one day would go. And we wanted it to be as straightforward
as possible would be. We had Pierre been like you Were fifteen,
asked her to marry you so that you can get out. We knew that it
in East Germany was no place for you. Everything was prepared. We
have been waiting for a sign from thee. ""
The tears ran down my face. I had my parents
may never be seen again. You knew it counter everything they
important was that they had helped me to leave the country. This would
they did for me. Because she loved me. My green light was not
okay, the green light was to be happy.
Bare hesitate for hatred in me. There are things that I can the
DDR does not forgive. Destroying families, one of them. The
has another dimension as fruit scarcity or torch processions.
This system brought parents to give away their children for ever.
Such wounds can be healed by anything.
As I slumped in 1995 and the sniffling
Sofa sitting saw, I realized what had been spared me. The
Grace of late birth was given to me a whole new meaning.
My road to the West would have overwhelmed me at that time perhaps.
I was a little naive girl. But my parents had me

Whereas within the UK and within Spain the same sense of sovereignty and authority lies with the wider entities rather than the regions.  Therein I think lies the difference between the two.  People aren't against the idea of integration in general, it is just that some people want that integration to come with them as a sovereign entity with decision-making power, rather than as a subdivision of a wider sovereign. It would help in both dealing with domestic policy and in getting their points of view across at European level.

As for the history of the unions - I can't speak for Catalonia, but Scotland as it stands has a separate legal system, Church, education and health system, sporting teams and much more.

Now Germany is actually doing pretty well (partially because Bavaria footed a big part of the bill on many federal subsidiary programs) and they feel proud of that too. So in accordance with their collective personality they will celebrate said pride.

Assume we would go by your suggestion. ""Time-proven"" ideas and convictions are given the benefit of the doubt, while proponents of new claims carry all the burden of proof. So we would, presumably, still live in a world where women don't vote (time-honored stereotype has it that women aren't entirely rational), where most non-white ethnicities are barely human (and might be treated as goods, more or less), where those who suffer from, say, schizophrenia, are to be separated from society, since they are clearly different from the normal people.

I could go on, but I'm sure you see the pattern. The problem with your approach is that it is a thoroughly pre-scientific one. If you seriously believe that, just because some belief has been held for a long time, it is automatically more valid, you invite all kind of hocus-pocus that you will most likely find rather unpalatable yourself.

The actual irony in the fall of the Berlin Wall was its timing. In my class, the history homework from the previous week, the morning of November 10 1989 was: ""Reason why the antifascistic barrier is still needed today!""  
Quod non iam erat demonstrandum.  
I wouldn't have had a good explanation two days before, either. Or at least I would have 
done anything not to have to give one.  
I'd already known that the Wall would not keep me from leaving. For my plans, the GDR was too small. I dreamed of Paris and New York. I wanted to study, see the world. I did not want to become a dissident expelled from university - I knew too many intelligent people who were tending to the graves on cemetaries. I wanted to go to France, the motherland of the revolution.  
I had my plans for my departure laid out exactly for about a year. There were no leaks. My strategy was simple: Finish school, marry foreigner, depart via family reunion.  
I had two realistic options: my school friend Robert, who had a French father and was just waiting to finish school, or Eric from Marseille, whom I'd met during summer break at the Baltic Sea. It was a question of time. Robert would come of age in May 1990, Eric in August.  
By marrying a foreigner, I would have stayed a citizen of the GDR, but that didn't mean that they'd let me back in again. The people, who were my family in the East, were all part of the circle of explicitly undesirable persons. The people, who would have taken me in in the West, were expelled and frozen-out(?) GDR citizens. Less than optimal conditions for a permanent visa. It was the price of my freedom.  
My problem was not the question, how to escape from the East, my problem was, how do I tell my parents ..  
It was the biggest conflict of my youth. I could not manage to tell them what was already written in stone. That I would leave this country at the earliest date possible and that I gave up the battle in the East for academic studies and a passport. I was sure it would kill them.  
In the fall of 1989, all my departure plans became unnecessary. When Robert got eighteen, escaping was out of the question.  
The years went by, I was able to study and we grew used to living in the West. In the Spring of 1995, I visited my parents with a Swedish friend of mine. We sat in the living room, drank red wine and told him amusing anecdotes from the GDR. Abruptly, he asked what I would have done if the Wall had not fallen. I had answered that question a hundred times. I was just going to start talking, when I suddenly felt an almost forgotten lump in my throat. It threatened to suffocate me. Pangs of guilt.  
I realised that this was the moment to confess to my parents that I would have left them. Six years had passed, and we hadn't spoken about it one single time. What would have happened, if? We'd just blocked out the topic. It was taboo.  
I felt, how I suddenly was a teenager again and didn't allow myself to even feel that I wanted to get out of the East, that my life in the GDR opposition wouldn't go on. I was a deserter. I betrayed all the people who were important to me, because I wasn't willing to stay here. But I already knew that the fate of a martyr was not for me. I wanted to think and to write, not to learn how to do pottery. My goal was the university, and there was no alternative.  
I would have given everything to have my parents come with me. But that wasn't up for discussion. They would have stayed. Against all reason. Out of principle.  
But I, their child, I wasn't better than all the others that were leaving the country. But I couldn't take it anymore, that I was told what I had to do, not to do and to read. I hated the smallmindedness of the GDR, this bigoted madness, installed between Wandlitz and Western television. Out of shame, I projected all my longing for freedom into a concrete destination: France. I thought it was different. I believed, if I married away, it would be weighted differently than an emigration application. I never wanted to go to Western Germany or to the other part of Berlin. I wanted to go to another country. It was my form of loyalty to the land that I came from, to the people who had raised me, to principles, that weren't even mine, but were stuck in me like an artificial joint. I wasn't a typical GDR child, but I was a hundred percent pure product of reform communistic ideas. Because I always had to sugarcoat the East to myself, I needed some residue of ideal. I wanted the GDR to have something good about it, to have something that I could understand as a sign of reconciliation, something, that differentiated us from the other Germany in a positive way. I was adamant in my belief that Honecker was just doing it wrong and that this system, once it had grown up and moved away from Stalinism, would be the beneficial communism. With all the radicalness of my youth i believed we would be able to change the GDR. But I also knew, I was available as a diplomat at most. I sensed that it was self-deception, but I didn't want to accept the truth. Precisely because I knew the GDR better than most of my peers, I've always underestimated it.  
As likely as not, I would have moved to West Berlin at some point anyway, and would have, as often as possible, stood at Checkpoint Charlie and looked over the Wall at my home. Some day, I would have jumped into the Landwehrkanal, mad with loneliness. United in the grave with Rosa Luxemburg, who presumably would have been closer to me in exile than many people from Kreuzberg.  
My parents were waiting. It was time to tell them. I worked up my courage and said, barely audibly: ""I would have gone into the West"". Then I looked at them. My mother had taken my father's hand. He quietly cleared his throat. Mama began speaking with a choked voice: "" We have always known that you would leave one day. And we wanted it to be as uncomplicated as possible. We had asked Pierre, when you were fifteen, to marry you, so you could leave. We knew that there was no room for you in the GDR. It was all ready. We were just waiting for a sign from you.""  
Tears were running down my face. I may have never seen my parents again. They knew that. Against everything that was important to them, they would have helped me to escape from the country. They would have done that for me. Because they loved me. They green light did not mean okay, their green light meant become happy.  
Sheer hate welled up in me. There are things I cannot pardon the GDR for. The destruction of families is one of those. That has another dimension to it than the lack of fruit or torch processions. This system made parents give their children away forever. Such wounds can not be mended by anything.  
When I saw myself sitting on the sofa in 1995, slumped and sniffling, I realised what I had been spared from. The mercy of a late birth received an all new meaning to me. My way into the West may have overburdened me then.  
I was a little naive girl. But my parents would not have kept me, because they knew that, in spite of everything, it would have been the right decision for me.

By the way,

&gt; We're tough with money because we can't avoid it. What the fuck do you think you would do, if your ancestors were so screwed with that inflation? We're born this way. That's why we wanted the ECB in Frankfurt.

Actually, it wasn't the hyperinflation that created the mess. It was adhering to the gold standard. [Read this.](http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/weimar-europe-)

&gt; At the end of its hyperinflation, Germany locked itself into a currency regime, the international gold standard, which was deliberately designed to be so limiting that exit was impossible. The anticipated consequence was that the country would appear credible and become attractive to foreign capital.

&gt;As the strategy worked, capital inflows sparked both public-sector and private-sector booms. Governments at all levels funded politically attractive but expensive infrastructure projects. 

&gt;But there was a downside. The boom’s vigor, coupled with prior experience of inflation, led to wage increases that were not matched by productivity gains.

His behavior in the scandals surrounding his person was neither honest, nor honorful, but of a weasel-lawyer kind I don't expect from a head of state. In the end this overshadows everything else.

I'm kind of skeptical about Gauck. He may be accomplished and all, but he seems the wrong guy for times like this. He's old and oriented towards the past, I don't see how he can improve the people's opinion about politics. He keeps saying how great our republic is and how grateful he is for the freedom and all -- of course our career politicians love to hear such stuff, but I fail to see how that is going to help form the Germany in the 21st century.

So there would be a significant individual incentive to diminishing debt to 60%, as opposed to just a lofty goal right now.

I don't see why it should be any different with water. 

Additionally, most people don't drink tap water, but only bottled water (even un-carbonated). Or they drink filtered tap water, which costs more because of the filters (and work). Unfiltered tap water has a reputation of tasting bad and being calcareous/limy (I really don't know what the proper English term for ""Kalk"" is). That's why restaurants are not accustomed to serve tap water.

Every government program will cause a certain amount of fraud and waste, but I think it is a bit unfair to characterize welfare recipients in general as ""parasites.""

In American at least, many people on government assistance are children, the elderly, the disabled, students, and the temporarily unemployed.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Yes, I am serious. I am an open-minded critical thinker, not willing to buy into liberal holy cows just because they happen to be trendy.

1. In the points you mentioned the innovators did have a burden of proof and won. Women's franchise was a long series of pro and con arguments etc. Even female writers argued against it. Then the progressive side won, but not without some serious arguments, requiring serious proofs.

2. It is not at all sure these things were so bad as they are painted now by liberal intellectuals. Very few families have dad voting this way, dad voting that way. The human rights of Mexican Indians were admitted by the Spanish court something like 400 years ago. And so on.

I think generally liberal intellectuals tend to falsify history to paint it darker. For example racism was never traditional, it was a modern pseudoscience. Every time I look into a presumably oppressive period I find plenty of counter-examples. Ultimately, people are just people in every age. One ruler is reasonable, another is an asshole. Just human.

Another problem with liberal intellectualism is to confuse the formal with the substantial. It could be that you don't have franchise or generally inequal and yet live a meaningful, purpose, generally content life. Just because some formal rights were not guaranteed it did not mean people suffered all the time. One should rather look at the substantial effects than the formal rights.

3. The scientific method is that the burden of proof is precisely on the innovator. The heliocentric worldview was accepted when Newton, unlike Galilei, could actually prove the common sense geocentrism is wrong. Galilei tried the ""I cannot prove it, you prove I am wrong"" shit. It did not go down well. Unless proven otherwise the accepted tradition is by default right, because it is the result of previous human experiences and reasoning, even when not scientifically formal, better than nothing. If we have no biology, we just assume fishermen know fishes well. When biologists disagree with something fishermen believe, they have to prove it, not otherwise.

4.Nobody said ALL, it is a straw man. It is about the general pattern of a culture. Not all Germans like beer but German culture generally does. Liberal culture hates stereotypes, yet they are very useful shortcuts. They represent a weighted average, so that individual evaluation does not have to start from some uninformed neutral viewpoint, but from a good rough guess, and then refine it by the individual case. It arrives to a correct individual evaluation faster than a neutral standpoint. It is unfair for outliers, but useful for the common case.",0,1338411340,null,0,1338411894,0,c4u8876,t3_uaikz,t1_c4u8876,t1_c4u4eua,null,1429032800,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

It is however completely obvious that the shield is there as defence against potential russian missiles. Being two-faced about it serves no one and the fact that the potential for a full scale russian attack on central and western europe is close to 0 it serves as nothing but a provocation and a proclamation of dominance over europe by the US.

Only a third has been earmarked to finance government operations, with only a tiny sliver spent on stimulus projects for the anemic economy.
This circular lending is all about risk management. (...) The troika wants to ensure the same does not happen to its members and the taxpayers. (...)  the European authorities have a strong interest in avoiding the even higher costs that would result if Greece left the euro zone or defaulted completely on its debt.

Woah, I have another half-finished reply to one of your comments sitting in another tab (from the English translations for Continental articles discussion), not sure if I should get into another one while I'm trying to fix myself dinner.

Still, my personal opinions while I have to take necessary cooling-down breaks anyway:

&gt; I'm going to guess: you think that every major nation involved in the war committed major atrocities, yet only Germany has been stigmatized...forever?...by the war.

Not really, there are war crimes and then there are War Crimes, beginning with starting the whole thing in the first place, and ending with things like the Siege of Leningrad and mass murder by industrial means, depending on whether or not you count the Holocaust separately.  
The Soviets actually do get criticized quite a bit when you're talking to Eastern Europeans.

&gt; The US is not a pariah for destroying entire cities in Germany and Japan, including with firebombs and nuclear weapons;

Incidentally I've talked to my grandma about that just the other day, and heard some new details I hadn't known before. I haven't asked her, but I always (she told me about the Nazis and the War ever since I can remember) had the impression she took it as a fact of war, and by extension blamed the Nazis, not the US, even though her city was the one that saw the most raids (very few dead, though, because they had enough bunkers and stayed there every night).

&gt; So I bet Germans resent being forced to be ashamed of their history; they probably feel singled out for a disproportionate amount of shame, 

I wouldn't call it shame, it's more like a responsibility to keep the memory alive. 

&gt; and they feel they cannot properly express their resentment of the damage that the Allies inflicted upon them in WWII because everyone would say, ""Oh, you deserved it. You aren't a Nazi, are you?""

Not really, but what I find unfortunate is that people seem to be satisfied with knowing that the Nazis committed the Holocaust, and don't ask what their own countries did in terms of taking in Jewish refugees while they still had a chance to get away. And yes, being German makes it somewhat hypocritical to point Americans to the Évian Conference or the MS St. Louis, for example, because being passive is obviously not the same as building factories that use dead per day as a measure of productivity.",0,1338417778,null,0,false,0,c4u9qka,t3_uc86o,t1_c4u9qka,t1_c4u7ygu,null,1429033525,10,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,10

It is univocally seen as grave mistake nowadays. Back in the days, by the German population, it definitely was seen as unjust, and it is unjust by any moral standard you can think of. No, it was never declared as such officially because of political reasons: While Hitler was the one refusing to pay it, anymore, the young Federal Republic wanted to break with  Nazi policies, while at the same time continue being the same state as the Empire, the Weinmar Republic and the Third Reich was: To underline that the territory of East Germany actually belongs to the Federal Republic.

1. If there were Eurobonds, the interest rates for those would not depend on the performance of an individual member state.
2. The interest rates of highly indebted nations would decrease.
3. These nations would then be able to borrow more money either through their own bonds or Eurobonds.

What prevents those countries from spending this money again, as they did with the money borrowed after they joined the €-Zone?  If, for example Italy, currently paying ~7% interests on their bonds, gets back down to interest rates of 4-5%, as they were before the crisis, then there is no incentive to do harsh, but necessary reforms.

We influence both of those cultures so heavily, we don't even need to be there to experience them. We even play pretend with them occasionally, but we have no real solidarity with them. Most Americans have absolutely no idea about politics outside the US, even in general. They don't know the news is reported differently, their beliefs are generally seen as silly and outdated, and that the US has lost a great deal of respect over the last 50 years or so. They will open mouthed stare at anyone who shows the slightest adherence to their actual origins, like India, Chinese, Africans, etc. They just don't have the experience, and it's not a BAD thing, per se, it's just ignorance which many people share.

Optimism is a trait that other countries also have and Germany has the absolute opposite of. Americans will take risks, both economically and otherwise Germans would not touch. Americans just have a ""feeling"" and run miles with it, hoping they get the gold, while Germans are much more likely to measure the distance, get their fastest runner, make sure they have good times and THEN compete.

In short, Americans will take the plunge almost no other country in the world will do. Americans therefore (in business) tend to fail hard and fast. Germans on the other hand take things slow and steady. Likewise, they don't have the amount of people who have struck it rich because they have taken fewer risks, but their employment rate is pretty good, and their economy is seen as the best in the world currently.

Not quite ""endemic"" anywhere.

And what about the last [Financial Secrecy Index](http://www.financialsecrecyindex.com/2011results.html)?

&gt; The index [...] reveals the illicit financial flows that keep developing nations poor are predominantly enabled by rich OECD member countries and their satellites, which are the main recipients of these illicit flows

&gt; Top-10:

&gt; 1 - Switzerland

&gt; 2 - Cayman Islands

&gt; 3 - Luxembourg

&gt; 4 - Hong - Kong

&gt; 5 - USA

&gt; 6 - Singapore

&gt; 7 - Jersey

&gt; 8 - Japan

&gt; 9 - Germany

&gt; 10 - Bahrain

Another mention of Germany in [World's biggest corruption cases](http://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/bribe/2009/03/interactive-map-the-business-of-bribes.html).

And another recent incident: [nationwide investigations in Germany about huge bribing scandal involving doctors and cancer drugs.](http://www.welt.de/newsticker/dpa_nt/infoline_nt/brennpunkte_nt/article106161097/Bundesweite-Ermittlungen-gegen-Pharmafirmen-und-Aerzte.html)


I could do this all day, but the point is this: there is no ""endemic"" corruption, there are corrupt people. Blaming nations as a whole reminds me of another era.

An excuse is an excuse. Germany used Christoforakos and now Germany protects him.

&gt; ""The perception that Germany has no corruption problem has absolutely nothing to do with reality, but rather with the fact that a maximum of five percent of all corruption cases come to light,"" said Uwe Dolata, press spokesman for the trade union representing Germany's criminal police (BDK).

&gt; Germany is reeling. Deutschland GmbH, famed for the quality of its products rather than the largesse of its bribes, has been rocked by scandal after scandal. Nowhere is this more evident and more surprising than in the case of Siemens, the Bavarian power and communications giant embroiled in the largest bribery case in the history of the Federal Republic. Siemens is not alone, however. Volkswagen, DaimlerChrysler, Deutsche Bank, Infineon, Deutsche Bahn, GM/Opel, Linde and Ratiopharm have all been the subject of stories about questionable practices that management either knew nothing of or actively participated in

It's actually not creepy at all. Very calm, lots of trees, it almost looks like a park in some places. Plus you get to see the resting place of Jim Morrison and countless other famous people, if you want. I personaly don't like the ""tourist circuit"" much, there's tons of beautiful places on the high parts of the cemetery (it is HUGE, and built on a hill) that really are much more worth seeing than graves. And if a bit of macabre doesn't bother you and your SO I'd suggest visiting the catacombs in Denfert-Rochereau, it's quite popular and very interesting, I'm sure you'll find tours in English.

If you don't like catacombs and cemeteries, go for a walk on the Butte Montmartre (a bit cliché yes, but great nonetheless), and visit some museums. The Louvre is great but it's TOO big. You can either do a bit of research to know what you want to see before you go, or just get lost in the museum (it's so big you can just walk for a day and not see the same things twice). I'd recommend the Musée du Quai d'Orsay, which is incredible. The Musée Rodin is great too, it's small but there's a nice garden !

For food, if you like japanese food, go to the Rue Saint Anne in the 1st arrondissement. There's TONS of good japanese restaurants there (I like [Aki](http://www.qype.fr/place/502476-Aki-Paris), it's cheap and very good, their speciality is Okonomiyaki. Look it up.) If you want sushi, [Sushi Wa](http://www.qype.fr/place/1188802-Sushi-Wa-Paris) is a good choice, the food is good (not top notch but definitely great considering the price!) and it's close to Saint Michel, you can go for a walk and be in front of Notre Dame in maybe 10 minutes.

true,khthon,PORT,Portugal. Exit. EU. NOW.,"50 years from now, history could be read like this. 

Germany initiated two world wars and lost. Then, they worked very hard indeed to get out of the hole they put ALL OF Europe in. They suckled on the Marshall plan and regained economic superpower status. It then reabsorbed it's long due eastern half. Meanwhile, Germany had sold and loaned to many European countries, making them German-dependent. It was sort of a union but not. As Germany was exempt from any rules. Then, the debt horizon neared on this ill-United Europe. In this economically irrational world, smaller and weaker countries were unable to keep up with the interest rates due to natural growth limits and severe economical hampering from a botched currency - the Euro, and many years failed Euro policies and puppet institutions. Policies dictated by Germany. 

Nations future prospects became bleak and so, their interest rates were raised. Germany, as a core lender, profited from this. It had no interest in stopping the deadly feedback loop of recessive policies that could never lead to growth or employment or progress. More and more interest rates were being fed in bailout money from all European citizens and into Germany's (and others) banks. People even paid to store their money in German bonds. Never in history did so much money flowed into Germany, not even during the 1940's sacking of Europe. It was madness. ""Es war gut"". 

Any attempt to resuscitate zombie economies was halted. But what began in the South soon began to spread to the rest of Europe as it was too good of a bleeding to stop. From recession came a full blown depression. Still, no policy change was permitted and no compromise reached. Tensions grew and so did talks of ending this unbalanced and undemocratic Union, whose ideals had been forgotten or never existed at all. One by one, countries exited the Union and dissolved into social chaos. 

Some would even argue if it was nothing but a bold and cold reptilian move by a country to conquer what they always seen as rightfully theirs - Europe.

Now, on to the contract thing. Under French labor law, a contract is the norm, everything else is special. So if no written contract is signed, *the contract legally exists with most legally favorable terms for the employee*, including salary, benefits, wrongful termination and so on. So by not writting a contract, the employer takes all the burden of the legal risk. This being said, upholding this before a court would be an *interesting* experience, to say the least ;-)

Most Germans are really ashamed of the war, even the younger Germans, and there's a strong ""never again"" and ""how could it happen"" feeling. Having said that, there's also a sense of distance - it was not them, nor their parents, but their *grand*parents who were (basically) living in a military dictatorship that did horrible things with or without their knowledge and consent. But are you as a person responsible for what your grandparents did? Nope. Can you feel ashamed (or proud) about it? Yep.

The older generation tends to avoid the subject, either because it's too sensitive a subject (because of great personal loss, i.e. the loss of a father) or because of embarrassment (how would you like it if your dad was a Nazi?). Some people talk openly about it though, sometimes without being prompted, and will go off on a long story about how this and that happened during the war, and why that new house is there because the old one was bombed to smithereens (while they were in the shelter down the street).

But yeah, life goes on. For an American, I can understand why you would eternally associate Germany with the war, but for most Europeans Germany is also just a neighboring country and so we have to learn to live with each other. I mean, how many times can you scream ""You Nazi!"" in your neighbors face? And is that still a valid thing to do after 65 years, when all involved parties are for all practical reasons dead and buried?

The shit we've done was so beyond any comprehension, that we're in complete denial now. Germans are good, Germans are right, Germans are a role model.

Loads of blabla, no substance. What do you mean ""fuck up""? Germany did not fuck up their fiscal politics like Greece did. That's simply a fact. Germany also has a working state and tax system, Greece doesn't have either.

&gt;We still don't like Easterners and think they are second-class citizens. We only appreciate immigrants that we silently force them to behave like they're more Germans than Germans. We don't like others. We think most Turks are backwards people but we don't say it out loud. It wouldn't be politically correct to say anything about Muslims. 

Relevance to the Euro crisis?

By the way, this is exactly the same in ALL European countries. Have you lived anywhere else? No? Because **xenophobia is EVERYWHERE**.

&gt;We'd also like to say Israel one thing or two about Palestine, but we would be fucked over with a hanukkiya.

What complete bullshit. There is NOTHING that isn't ""allowed"" to be said. Plenty of people criticise Israel. This is one of those neo-Nazi propaganda lies, I'm sorry to tell you.

German society is plenty anti-Semitic (like loads of European societies), Israel is constantly criticised in the most dumb ways. No, there is no clear evil in the conflict. Get that out of your head.

&gt;We're tough with money because we can't avoid it. What the fuck do you think you would do, if your ancestors were so screwed with that inflation? We're born this way. That's why we wanted the ECB in Frankfurt.

""Tough with money""? Quantitative easing is happening RIGHT NOW. In Europe. The ECB is using their money more liberally than ever before. This is a media dream image built up. It is NOT the truth. There is no ""tough"" money politics in Europe right now.

&gt;We think we're more efficient because we're Germans. In reality, we're efficient because Americans made us to be. Their industry helped our industry. 

Actually the Marshall Plan gave relatively little money to Germany compared to say Britain. It helped and sparked the fire, but that is not the reason for the German economic success. Britain = more American money, industry went to shit = wrong conclusion.

&gt;EU adopted favourable measures for us and there you have it. 

The Euro is favourable for Germany, all the BILLIONS and BILLIONS of Euros put into Southern Europe through EU structure funds is very favourable for Southern Europe. Germany is a huge net giver and not a taker. I grew up in Spain, who do you think paid for all the new roads that were built? That's right, the European Union, aka most prominently Germany.

&gt;Part-time jobs help with statistics but we don't want any of that. Others fiddle with statistics. We're Germans, right? It doesn't matter if you can't live on your own, as it happens with many of us. The government solved the problem, you have an underpaid part-time job!

These sentences don't make much sense. We are living in a globalised world. Globalisation cannot be halted or reversed.

Germany reformed its job market to become competitive again. They succeeded. Germans don't need to fucking complain, though. Remember, NOBODY HAS TO STARVE OR BE HOMELESS. Government welfare for anyone that doesn't have a job or doesn't earn enough. This is luxury. Not many countries have anything remotely similar. Not even in Europe. Southern Europe has NOTHING in welfare compared to Germany.

&gt;We like Europe. We like Europe because we can say we're Europeans, being a German carries the Nazi stigma. Can't really do anything about it. 

Bullshit. The European Union was a post-WW2 peace and economic project. It succeeded brilliantly in both. Economic integration = huge success. Political integration = huge success. has nothing to do with national images. Germany and France tied their countries together for lasting European peace and prosperity. Guess what, IT WORKED.

&gt;That's why we pay bailouts. Which are not really bailouts. But we're Germans and we pretend that they are what we say they are.

No, sorry, bullshit. Germany pays bailouts to avoid financial catastrophe grabbing the whole EU. That's in their own interest. 

&gt;Despite all these, I love my country. I just wished it loved itself and others more. No more lies.

No. Stop believing bullshit on the internet. Things aren't this fucking simple. If you truly want to understand things you have to read.

I'm going to give some generalities and oversimplifications to make this easy to understand.

Before the roman arrival to Spain, the language was already spoken in this region and the local religion was the adoration of the gods of nature. 

When the romans came, they brought their religion, christianism, and tried to erradicate any signs of ""paganism"", a process that ended around the year 1610 c.e., with the inquisition burning the witches of Zugarramudi.

Before and after this two events, there were historical periods in which different ethnic groups ruled a part of Spain, Celtic, Greeks, Fenicians, Carthaginians, Vandals, Visigoths, Swabians, Alans, Vikings, Arabs, Francs, and in modern times the French with Napoleon.

So this language and this culture was altered with this invasions, some of the people's names are adaptations of christian names, i.e. Michael / Mikel, John / Ion. Other names are toponymical, i.e. Garazi, Irati. There are other names which are a composition of words, i.e. Argider (argi-eder, beautiful light). And another ones describe nature, i.e. Ibai (river), Eguzki (sun), Lorea (flower). 

It's a complicated matter, and I made a lot of oversimplifications, but I hope this calms your curiosity :)

I used to dream about living in the U.S. when I was young - the 90s, to be specific. A lot of that dream was based on what the U.S. looked like on television.

I don't have that dream anymore. The country is still beautiful, but I have met many Americans in the mean time who ruined the dream for me.

Don't get me wrong, I know some Americans well and I like a lot of them. They are, however, not what I would call ""typical"" Americans.

The following is an amalgamation of my experiences with American tourists / exchange students in Germany, Americans in Canada (me being the exchange student), Americans in the U.S. (me being the tourist), news / current affairs and Reddit.

* Fat - this one is heavily slanted by Reddit, but statistics seem to support this.
* Entitled - heavily based on American tourists. I know that more people speak English than any other language in the world. Doesn't entitle you to demand to be spoken to in your mother language while halfway around the world
* Disinterested. Not necessarily stupid. ""I thought Europe was a country"" is a good example. If she had ever bothered to find out about anything going on outside of the U.S. borders, she'd have known. The reoccurring TIME magazine covers comparing the U.S. and the ""international"" covers is another good example. Much less focus on the rest of the world. My gut feeling is that this attitude stems from having been / still feeling like the center of the universe.
* Loud. Woo girls, tourists holding conversations on public transportation trains loud enough for the whole car to hear.

I live in Berlin, so this is colored by how tourists come off in one of the most touristy locations in Germany. I have similar things to say about other tourists, too.

CAVEAT: These, of course, are the things which are easy to notice while in superficial contact. I do not think that all Americans are fat, entitled, disinterested and loud. But when I notice a fat, entitled, disinterested and loud person, the chance that it's an American is higher than average. When an American is not fat, entitled, disinterested and loud, chances are I will not notice them as an American right away.

Back to the dream: Assuming that I will meet many Americans living in the U.S. which are similar to the ones I have experienced in other places, I would probably not be happy living in the U.S. for a long time. The dream has dwindled down to three cities I can see myself living in (New York, San Francisco and Portland) which any ""red-blooded"" American will denounce as not typically American.

Which is kind of the point.

Europe has to decide, either we create a formation like the US where states are separate but there is a unified economic policy and the strongest states help the poorest balance the loses (because that's how everybody wins - cause now we are essentially competitors) or we just call the whole thing off and start throwing ""problematic"" states out of the Eurozone.

Ich fand die ""Diskussion"" danach bei SternTV merkwürdig. 

Da saß dann der Walraff, irgendeiner von verdi und einer von Hermes da. 

Die meiste Zeit ging für Wiederholungen der Tatsachen aus dem Bericht drauf. Danach wurde das gleiche nochmal in anderer Wortwahl gesagt. Dann durfte der Hermes-Typ davon erzählen, daß Hermes sein System umbaut. Zum Ende hin kam dann erst die Frage mit dem Preis auf (ich glaube sogar durch den Paketzusteller der im Publikum war). Woraufhin der Hermes-Typ sagte, daß sie mit Post/DHL einen Konkurrenten auf dem Markt haben der vom Staat subventioniert wird und somit die Preise drückt. 

Das war der einzig interessante Punkt in der ganzen Diskussion. Darauf wurde dann nicht mehr eingegangen. Schlimmer: ein Bericht der sich wohl kritisch mit Versandkosten aus Sicht des Kunden beschäftigen sollte, fiel aus Zeitgründen in dieser Sendung weg! Der Moderator kaute nochmal kurz alles was schon gesagt wurde zum dritten Mal durch und am Ende von SternTV war doch noch Platz um süße Tierchen zu zeigen...

true,Turbomullet,NETH,The Netherlands,"Oh yes, exactly. A national bank can be as undemocratic and corruopt a larger european system of finance. That is a slighty different sotry about how money is created out of debt and the whole global financial system is flawed to the core, that in essence says nothing about europan finance, i'll grant you that. The problem lies on how it works on a political level. The more unified a nation is by law and politics the better a unfied currency works. For example the united states has no souvereign states, there are very clear federal laws, and there is some limited room for states to decide about gay marriage, and the death penalty etc. However it is the fedral goverment that can decdide over citizens and private coorperations and property. And that's allright for the yankees, because as a people from all clasess and races they ackknowledge the flag they are unified under and it has been so for 200 years, and thats a situation where a unified currency works for people. Europe is made out of countless cultures, and variations in traditions of commerce, social systems, philosophys about life style and economics that date back thousands of years. 

After the war, we started agreements about the production of certain goods, and subsidising certain goods to benefit all. Also we openend the bourder and celibrated our freedom and peace. We just took it one step too far. That was the euro and the centralising of law(european constutution). (this has been voted against in national reffenda, but still got through with different name) Now we see the system failing. Greece is a great example of how there is 0 faith left in pro-eurpean politicians who should have seen this coming, resulting in useless votes for populist super left and extreme right party's this is happening everywhere. They destroyed the dream by taking it too far. The european pussy was by far not wet enough to stick in this dry cock of financial and political unification. And where are not putting out. 

Maybe some other time in the future when, culture and nation is less significant than it is now. However we see global politics and global finance failing miserably more and more, because of sheer greed. The unification is just greese to oil a money making machine to benefit the rich, that is how global coorperate economics work. They deceide 1 single worth, that every nation and economy regardless of skill, and resources have to abide to or fuck off. Well naturally there are nations left behind, confused bitter and broke with a national debt so high wont be able to pay it back in a liftime.
What we need is to regain our local focus on production of tangible goods and a system of trade and distribution that works for the people closest to production and consumption. This is also the only way we can start thinking about ecologics, duribility and nature, by focussing on our OWN envirourment and what goes in our mouths. 

Why should the social programs be cut in my country to pay for the incompetence of creece bankers and their culture of low taxes and early retirement. and why should some guy in creece be depented of how much I consume and taxes I pay so he wont be bankrupt.

&gt;The scientific method is that the burden of proof is precisely on the innovator. The heliocentric worldview was accepted when Newton, unlike Galilei, could actually prove the common sense geocentrism is wrong. 

You're under a misconception about how science works, or you chose to misrepresent it. Beliefs that are derived in a way that does not conform to the state-of-the-art methods employed by the field in question are simply discarded. Galileo Galilei is an interesting example, because even though he turned out to be right, he did indeed have the burden of proof: proponents of the alternative view were, to my knowledge, more or less using acceptable tools (observation and mathematical modeling), they only used them in an inferior way (ignoring some evidence, clinging to a model simply because it was the traditional one). 

The situation we're discussing here is different: why would sociology, anthropology, political science etc. even consider the anecdotal evidence and popular opinion about some groups, when the methods used to gain knowledge in those fields are fundamentally different from the process that gave rise to the popular opinions? The annecdotal evidence/popular opinion can serve as a *starting point* for real research, sort of as a heuristic for guiding the direction of research, but the actual content of those opinions can be about as easily discarded as climate scientists can simply discard the popular feeling that ""it doesn't actually seem to get much warmer"".",0,1338468234,null,0,false,0,c4uhu7c,t3_uaikz,t1_c4uhu7c,t1_c4u8876,null,1429037413,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Da du nicht widerlegen kannst, dass es Gott gibt, genauso wie niemand widerlegen kann, dass es Gott nicht gibt, sind vom wissenschaftlichen Standpunkt aus beide im Recht. Es hat einen Grund, warum die meisten Physiker, die ich kenne, die Existenz eines gottähnlichen Wesens nicht abstreiten würden (und rein wissenschaftlich gesehen, gar nicht abstreiten dürfen).

Die Frage der Relevanz ist dagegen eine andere: Wenn es diese Höhere Macht gibt, mischt sie sich in mein Leben ein? Keine Ahnung. Da wir weder Informationen über die Art der Fähigkeiten dieses Wesens besitzen, noch über ihre Beweggründe, haben wir keine Ahnung.

Aber das bedeutet ja nicht, dass es sie nicht gibt. Maximal, dass sie sich nicht um uns kümmert. Daher ist es aus auch prinzipiell unmöglich einen Gottesbeweis zu führen, genauso wie den Gegenbeweis. 

Allerdings glaube ich, dass die Frage nach der Relevanz einer eventuell existierenden Gottheit bei weitem interessanter ist, als deren Existenz: Wenn es die Gottheit gibt, und sie sich nicht kümmert, ist es dasselbe, als gäbe es sie nicht? Nur woher solche Dinge wissen?

Daher heißt es Glauben. Und nicht Wissen.

As a born and raised New Yorker (not from the city, but close) I can say that this mindset is a common one found in the US. People from NYC are considered rude/cold because they're busy doing their own thing instead of smiling at and talking with random strangers. I do my best to avoid the store greeters, I hate it when every cashier I have to interact with asks me how I am (it's not as if they actually care), and for the most part it makes me uncomfortable when a complete stranger starts to talk to me for no apparent reason. I also have a hard time trusting someone that is overly friendly the very second they meet me because it comes off as fake. By US standards, on the surface I'm an unfriendly person but the reality is that couldn't be further from the truth.

I have non-American friends that have been to Germany many times (I sadly haven't had the opportunity, though I'm teaching myself German and I really hope to get the chance to visit one day) and everything I've heard from them about how German people are leaves me to believe that I would feel much more at ease in a room full of Germans than a room full of Americans.
