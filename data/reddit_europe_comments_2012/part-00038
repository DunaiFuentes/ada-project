true,Oda_Krell,EURO,"German, living in the Netherlands","I can understand both sides in this conflict -- in the end, it is really about two rather different (banking &amp; finance) cultures at work.

Germans are frustrated by the lack of Swiss enthusiasm to fight tax evasion by German account holders, and the Swiss are understandably pissed off by a lack of respect that German politicians show for Swiss business practices (which hold bank secrecy in high regards).

There's no easy solution either: Germany certainly won't break all ties with Switzerland and flat out ban transfers to Swiss accounts (which wouldn't hold in front of EU courts anyway), but Switzerland can't act completely without regard for German demands either, unless it wants to risk alienating one of its largest economic partners. There's a bilateral treaty in the works that seeks to finds a compromise, but to some of the involved German politicians (mainly social democrats), it doesn't go far enough in punishing tax evaders.

In the end, I see the Swiss arrest warrants mainly as a symbolic gesture: unless Switzerland requests extradition (which I hope they won't), nothing really bad will come out of it, other than that the German officials won't be able to enter Switzerland in the future unless they want to risk being arrested.

Etant loin du central, Orange me proposait un maximum de 2 Mo avec la télé par satellite (avec 4 chaines HD au bout de 2 ans d'attente, wouah !!!). La hotline est déplorable, je tiens à le préciser.
Temps de la migration chez Free: 10 jours. Je passe de 2 à 4 mo, j'ai un magnétoscope numérique et un lecteur Blu-ray en prime et je gagne 3€ sur mon abonnement par rapport à Orange.

Je vais maintenant faire la même opération pour mon mobile, un Iphone avec forfait Origami à 64€, chez free c'est légèrement moins cher: 16€ !!!

J'ai connu les débuts de la téléphonie mobile, et les premières années ce n'était pas non plus brillant chez SFR, Bouygues et FT.
Si Free n'avait pas joué les trublions sur le marché de l'ADSL, on en serait encore à des abonnements à 4 Mo en téléchargement limité, avec la télé en option pour 50 €/mois.

Free arrive sur la téléphonie et oh magie, on découvre que les autres opérateurs peuvent baisser leurs forfaits. On appréciera aussi, comme à leur habitude, l'impartialité des média (télé/presse écrite) le jour du lancement de l'offre de Free. Ce n'est en fait pas fini, comme on peut le voir en ce moment, à en croire ces ""journalistes"", on ne peut même plus téléphoner avec Free.

Firstly, [I don't think it's correct to assume anything](http://www.theawl.com/2011/05/scenes-from-madrids-15m-protests) about the people that were engaging in the vandalism/setting trash containers on fire. I'd wager that there were students involved, and as I'm sure you're aware the younger generation in Spain is a bit fucked at the moment--youth unemployment is now over 50% and this generation gets called the *ni nis* (neither nors) because many of them can neither study nor work. They feel like they don't have a future and they are rightfully pissed.

Secondly, no one is scum, and we all have a right to our worldviews and political beliefs. The squatters I've known have been people who entered an abandoned space and tricked it out, improving the property and living better than I do. Do you know anything about anarchism, or [anarchism in Spain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism_in_Spain) in particular? [And what exactly is work](http://www.scribd.com/doc/62979171/The-Language-of-Work-by-Mark-Kingwell), how much of it should we all be doing and to what ends? Perhaps you also know that jobs pay miserably here, to the tune of about a grand a month, while the cost of living has soared.

Thirdly, I was there on Thursday and witnessed some of the arson and vandalism. These seemed to be small groups of mischiefmakers; the wide majority of people were there to engage in a peaceful demonstration on the occasion of the general strike. The behavior of the police was utterly reprehensible, pepper spray cop ratcheted up several notches of horrifying. One of the first things I saw was [them trying to drive through a crowd of peacefully sitting protesters](http://youtu.be/wOzB0w5ol9A) up C/Pelai and then begin shooting around haphazardly to disperse it--these people were not doing anything wrong. I saw one riot officer literally throw a girl off her bicycle for asking him a question. [Here they are shooting at some cyclists](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-1kA0cdbks) for absolutely no reason at all. [A man has lost his eye](http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/1359670/0/herido-barcelona/disturbios-barcelona/huelga-29m/) and another, [his sight](http://www.vilaweb.cat/noticia/4000349/20120404/facebook-censura-foto-ferit-lull-bala-goma-mossos.html).

I don't speak Catalan only Spanish, so I have problems sometimes when I'm around friends and family speaking Catalan. At first it made me very upset that they would speak Catalan knowing that I don't speak it. Catalonians don't think there's anything wrong with doing this though, so try to be patient and not get offended if people disregard your language preferences.
Also Barcelona has some of the best pickpockets in the world because there aren't any laws if they steal less than €200. So watch your wallet and don't be stupid. 
To be honest, youre gonna be there during tourist season. During the summer a majority of the locals leave and go to their mountain houses or vacation flats so your experience might be a little different than mine.
Also expect to see topless women at the beaches. Warn your girlfriend haha.

The Government Of Ireland Act (or the third Home Rule Bill, not the 1920 Act) provided for the partition of Ireland along sectarian lines.

This was in response to unionists in Ulster forming a paramilitary organisation (the UVF) which threatened to use any means necessary, including violence, to stop Ireland from gaining Home Rule. Home Rule was supported by the majority of Irish people and it successfully passed through the House of Commons and House of Lords. 

Of course, the Tories were only too happy to take advantage of the crisis and they wholeheartedly backed the right of the UVF to use terrorism to prevent Ireland being given Home Rule.

That's without even considering the previous 40 years of Tory and Unionist attempts to prevent Ireland gaining any measure of self-determination, even within the Union.

If the will of a people is blocked for long enough, then it's hardly surprising when shit eventually gets real. 

Had democracy been allowed to win the day, Ireland might still be a part of the UK.

But it wasn't, and people eventually got so pissed off that they turned to extremists that they had previously never supported.

Ideologically, the EDL aren't *supposed* to be racist and in fact, the leadership actively ejects racist contingents of the organisation. That said, there's no denying that among the lower down members of the organisation there is plenty of racism. To apply fascist to the group is, I think, shows a serious misunderstanding both of what the EDL strive for and what fascist ideology actually is. From my understanding of the EDL's general objectives they tend toward being relatively liberal (don't laugh, conservative they may be, but *relatively* liberal compared with other right wing organisations). The EDL is certainly far more geared towards functional multiculturalism than any fascist organisation could be. They are not anti-foreigner, they are anti-islam.

I think it's both unfortunate that their membership is mostly not very nice people who probably have different goals to the leadership, but *also* that people look at the EDL and conflate them, the French far right, and the BNP or NF.

This is all when the word is in the nominativ case. If if i use das Fenster in the Dativ case, it turns in *dem* Fenster. This in turn influences how you conjugate the rest of the sentence.

CONCLUSION

Given the prerequisites and limitations of the model, it allows the following conclusions:

* Democratic elections result in merely mediocre political leaders.

* The improvements that can be achieved by subsequent election steps are limited.

* The main advantage of democratic elections is that they effectively prevent lower-than-average candidates from becoming leaders.

* Substantial and lasting improvements in leadership can be achieved only by improving the average CQ of the entire compound.

* Democratic rules, such as the freedom of the press, have to guarantee that ruling leaders are not allowed to hinder the growth of average capabilities.",0,1333536027,null,0,false,0,c48c1ne,t3_rrrgy,t1_c48c1ne,t1_c48b9v7,null,1428653013,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

&gt; Democracy has historically had a pejorative meaning attached

Democracy has had a pejorative meaning attached by people who see democracy in a pejorative light.  I.e. not a terribly credible point of view.

&gt; democratization has led to cynicism, misinformation, partisanship, and a general atmosphere of antagonism.

No, the breakdown of civility in politics, the failure to control lobbyists, the vast increase in the powers of the executive, the failure to keep religion out of campaigning, a defective unrepresentative electoral voting system, the decrease in effectiveness of public school funding and civics education, and more factors than I care to spend three hours listing here are what have led to these.

Democracy is a good thing and can be made to work.

Thus, no matter the system, it all comes down to what checks and balances there are in place. Technocratic and Meritocratic systems can work perfectly fine as long as there are proper checks and balances to keep the leaders from abusing their power (among which popular consent can be one). Moreover, one system doesn't automatically alienate another, meritocracies and technocracies can contain elements of democracy and vice versa.

Democracies can and will fail in the same way if no proper restrictions are placed on the powers that be.

-------------------------

Yesterday, [a 78-year-old Italian woman leapt to her death from a fourth floor balcony after her pension was cut](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/03/us-italy-suicide-idUSBRE8320T220120403). Cost of life and taxation are on the rise, while salaries and pensions are being cut, thus creating an unsustainable situation for many people in Europe. While they don't see a single eurocent from the so-called ""bailouts"", bankers are rubbing their hands in glee.

Still not much information and verification is needed, but according to some sources the pensioner was a pharmacist and wrote that he didn't want to search for food in trash cans. His name was Dimitris Christoulas.

Edit 1: Before pulling the trigger, eyewitnesses heard him saying that he didn't want to leave debts to his children. For some context, pharmacists often find themselves in a difficult situation, because the state owes them money (patients buy medicines and pay contribution according to their insurance fund's rules, state funds pay the rest).

Edit 2: From his note.

&gt; *Tsolakoglou's occupation government annihilated every trace of my survival. [...] I cannot find my rights, I cannot find another way of reaction, except for a decent end, before I start searching the trash for my survival and becoming a burden for my child.""*

(Tsolakoglou was ""Prime Minister"" of the ""Greek"" ""government"" during the Nazi occupation. He draws a parallel because the current PM is unelected and Germany calls the shots in the austerity program, bringing down crucial state sectors, e.g. the Health sector.)

Edit 3: The President of the Pharmacists Association talking on the radio, saying that he knew the pensioner, he always stood patient and dignified, despite the bureaucracy and injustices of the system. Choosing Syntagma Square (Athens' central square, right across the Parliament) was symbolic. Other experts confirm that suicides are on the rise in Greece and Italy. There is correlation between unemployment and the number of suicides.

Edit 4: More mentions by former colleagues. No mental health issues.

Edit 5: Mainstream Greek media start to play down the suicide. Government advertising funds newspapers and TV stations, politicians get coverage and airtime. SMSs and e-mails trying to organise a protest. Slogan: ""we shouldn't get used to deaths"".

Edit 6: [The suicide note](http://www.protothema.gr/article/?aid=188098) ([mirror](http://i.imgur.com/yeBr4.jpg))

Translation:

&gt; *Tsolakoglou's occupation government essentially annihilated my ability for survival, which was based on a decent pension that I ALONE (without state funding) paid for 35 years.*

&gt; *Due to my age leaving no capacity for dynamic reaction as an individual (without excluding being the second person, if another Greek grabbed a Kalashnikov), I can't find another solution other than a decent end, before starting to search in the trash for my nutrition.*

&gt; *I believe that young people without a future, one day will take the guns and hung the traitors upside down in Syntagma (note: Constitution) Square, as the Italians did to Mussolini in 1945 (Piazzale Loreto in Milan).*

But when you get to the point, like in France, where a huge proportion of beggars, pickpockets, copper thieves, and homeless people setting up their camps out in big, trash-filled installations in the middle of the city, are Roma, vastly more so than any other single population group, then you've got a serious serious problem, which is why many Americans don't understand why they are being targeted.

People (outside of a few extremist douches) aren't advocating going after Roma because they're Roma.  They're advocating going after Roma who break the laws because they break the laws.  Think of it not just as ""Roma"" but as part of a broader phenomenon of simply not being well equipped to deal with immigration.

Many European countries in the past 70 years have developed a sort of a principle of general good behavior and assumed civic common responsibility (on the whole, bear with me).   Laws against mendicancy and other anti-social behavior were not often enforced because it frequently wasn't necessary.  

All of a sudden, you've got immigration from Eastern Europe, North Africa, Asia, and elsewhere, with people who don't understand ""the rules"" (i.e. don't litter, etc.).  Immigration is generally a good thing, as it adds diversity, new points of view, fresh cultural blood, but most European countries found themselves unprepared for how to deal with this.  They say, oh, hm, all these newcomers, but don't understand that they may actually have to put some effort into enforcing laws that, to enlightened Europeans, might seem petty and oppressive, but are necessary to build a fundamental understanding of what it means to be part of a civil, well-behaved society.

By Santiago Salvador and Alejandra Núñez. Translated from the Spanish by Tiffany Carter (@catatoniatoday) 

*Photos by Alejandra Núñez, Santiago Salvador and Emma Gomis*

After [a relatively quiet morning in the city center](http://www.vice.com/es/read/bcn--piquete-primaveral-en-el-corte-ingls)—with merchants raising and lowering their shutters in step with the pickets, four worthless documents set afire in front of the stock exchange building and the odd raving news item such as that issued by the Minister of the Interior according to which a group of ""evildoers"" had [sacked a bingo hall](http://www.europapress.es/catalunya/noticia-piquete-asalta-madrugada-bingo-barcelona-lleva-2000-euros-20120329101403.html), making off with 2,000 euros in spoils—came a sunny and smoldering afternoon of urban warfare that ravaged all of the garbage bins, flowerpots and Starbucks within a one-kilometer radius.

The largest and most official demonstration, the one organized by the CCOO and UGT unions, was scheduled to arrive in Plaça Catalunya at around 7 p.m. It never made it to the square due to the tumult formed by the thousands of people awaiting it at its destination and because a chaotic pitched battle lasting over three hours had been underway since 5:30 p.m. Barricades were erected and trash containers torched at the eight entrances to Plaça Catalunya. The riot vans raced about willy-nilly as if someone had kicked a police beehive. From the corner of Plaça Urquinaona and C/Pau Claris, for example, we were able to observe up to three different barricades bursting into flames almost simultaneously. A priori this might seem like a well orchestrated and coordinated urban guerrilla attack, but the truth is that many of the hooded protestors got trapped between the barricades they themselves had ignited.

At 7:45 p.m. in Via Laietana near the Cathedral an 8-year-old boy asked his friends, ""Is the party over now?"" To which another, even younger boy replied, ""I'm not sure—there's a BBVA over there...""

The CNT strategically placed some members of its children's division at the entrance to Zara (the property of Amancio Ortega, the fifth richest man in the world according to *Forbes*) so everyone had a good view of them. They knew ALL the chants: “*No nos mires, únete*” (""Don't stare at us, join us""), “*Huelga general contra el capital*” (""General strike against capital""), “*No es una crisis, es el sistema*” (""It's not a crisis, it's the system""). More than one crustie and one or another veteran trade unionist shed a tear at the sight. Later the Zara was ransacked and some of its mannequins taken out for a stroll.

The celebrated *Iaioflautas* (rebel grandparents) were quick to arrive after taking a collective nap. [No joke.](http://www.facebook.com/events/267590593322696/)
 
There were so many people in Plaça Catalunya that a police charge seemed unfeasible. But the Mossos d'Esquadra must not be underestimated. Ever.

One of the afternoon's first barricades, on C/Pau Claris and Gran Via. The fire came later.

A reader sends [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBSxdksnqaM) of the trashing and burning of the Plaça Urquinaona Starbucks livened up with ambient electronica.

Might the act of sitting down in front of the police once it's all over to play with poi streamers (or whatever the hell they're called) be considered a form of psychological warfare?

A group of 9 undercover officers (much better camouflaged than those in the [assault on the Parliament](http://www.vice.com/es/read/cine-secretas-en-el-parc-de-la-ciutadella)) was identified and had to flee down C/Pau Claris. The one in black to the front right is carrying a metal rod that's got to be painful. At least he wasn't wielding a [lightsaber](http://policemenwieldinglightsabers.tumblr.com/). At the same time.

true,undercovermoderator,null,null,"What follows is a point regarding each quote and your analysis.

1. I felt it needed to mention Bloody Sunday given the context it was establishing. This was a military failure that acted as justification for terrorism for 30 years. That it didn't mention it speaks volumes about their mild pro-military agenda throughout the article.

2. I didn't say the story was glorified. I said it glorified brutish tactics of the British Intelligence. I should mention I feel it glorified the brutish tactics of the IRA also, but I figured I'd be given the credit of that, given my establishing sentence's position. One is a government-led institution with diplomatic powers, the other is a bunch of terrorists. I can't quote directly from the text, there's subtle language used but the book-ending nature of where they're placed contextualise all the gory details they go into. (Calling Kitson's methods of subversion, interrogation and duplicity valuable and referring to the British Intelligence's path as successes galled me in particular - success is not diplomatic breakdown resulting in thousands of deaths.)

3. Someone else addressed your mistake here.

4. The author repeatedly calls these tactics successful. Try telling that to the families of the dead participants (and innocents). I commend the British and the Northern Irish factions for their attitude in diplomatic resolution of the issue in the 90s. Not so sure about the 80s.

5. Here I'm saying the resolution of the ""Northern Ireland Problem"" could have been informed by the consequences of the British actions in India at the advent of independence - diplomatic laziness leading to the subsequent, border, religious and caste issues, the turmoil they left the place in. The troubles didn't really kick off until 19 years after that, and even though I know they were bubbling away all the while, there was still very poor diplomatic effort by Britain to resolve the situation.

In summation, the article should be using this story as a cautionary tale in diplomatic failure and its consequences. Instead I felt it describes a grim, gritty and thrilling military intelligence campaign that justifies modern military tactics in similar situations, with all the sensitivity of a sledgehammer.",0,1333548709,null,0,false,0,c48dgn4,t3_rptgu,t1_c48dgn4,t1_c47xbvv,null,1428653740,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

They are quite sheltered by society and granted pensions and land just for being Roma. They get away with all forms of child abuse, violent behavior, threatening of government officials and whoever gets in the way.
Examples: They wed 12 year olds, most get government pensions despite having obvious wealth, they ride public transportations without paying, they don't pay tolls, many young gang up to steal, they beat up anyone who remotely criticizes them, many deal drugs, have sweat shops with slave laborers and sometimes children, they hardly pay any taxes and are not pursued by the IRS, etc.. All of which are things I've witnessed countless times.

And of-course they are discriminated. But so are the unemployed or the elderly! And quite freely too. But if my culture had such strong connotations with mindless violence, I too would be discriminated, no matter how good of a citizen I was. So the change mus come from within the Roma community and there are little signs of such change.

So forgive my horrible generalizations but what I'd like to see is the law being applied uniformly to the population, no matter race, creed or wealth, and without fear of retaliation. If anyone wants to live in another country, they must obey the law. Period. They can preserve the many good aspects of their culture and still be functional citizens and not be constantly breaking laws.

One option to reduce crime in the area was to build a police office near their village, to keep all the drug addicts away.

There's no need to build a supermarket or something right next to it, to ""create jobs"". There is public transport going by that area, so anyone can easily get anywhere in the city. Saying that they don't have jobs because there aren't any right across the street is just stupid.

Also, keep in mind that we're not communists any more, it's not government's job to find jobs for everyone. The main problem here, as I already mentioned, is that monotonic 9-5 job is not appealing at all for them, as making drugs is A LOT more profitable and they don't even have to go anywhere. Demand is great too, while there aren't that many suppliers in the city. So even if some social worker managed to find a job for a bunch of gypsies, why would they take that job?

Immigrants nowadays are just transiting here, they clearly don't want to be here, settle down here or have anything much to do with the place other than getting a ride to Italy and then onwards to wherever.

You can probably imagine what it's like for them, they're in a place that is incapable of offering them much of anything so they have to fend for themselves. This inevitably leads to crime.

true,[deleted],null,null,"     I am just about ending my two week vacation here in Italia.  Here are some tips.  1. Buy Rick Steves in Italy and read those tips.  Here was my Itinerary day by day location by location.
     Day 1 arrive in Venice.  Buy 72 hour ticket for waterbus and bus system.  This took me into Venice and allows me to use the water bus system.  I think the cost was 28 or 50£ for two people.  After checking in I ate lunch at a small diner and bought train tickets to Florence.  Afterwards stroll arouind, I bought tickets to a concert the next night and went to the Davinnci Museum.  I ate dinner in the old Jewish section on the cannals.
     Day two we went to St. Marks square and headed for the large museum oppisite the square from the church. Buy dual tickets for the burge palace as well, this allows you to skip the line.  After the museum go through the Burge Palace, only take the audio tour if you like art.  Then I went to the church and attempted to go to the naval museum, but it closed at 1:00.  I walked the gardens and then headed to the cimmitero for a while observing the beautful graves.  Then I went back on land and walked to the concert which was wonderful, and proceeded to enjoy the ambience of St. Marks square.
     Day three we went to Florence.  BUY THE FLORENCE CARD FOR 50 EUROS.  IT GETS YOU IN EVERYWHERE AND YOU CAN SKIP ALL THE LINES AND RIDE ALL THE BUSES.  On that day we explored the Pitti Palace and ate the best burger in the world at a place called ringos just down the street from the pitti palace.
     Day four we went to see the David, attended mass at the duomo (The big dome church.)  ate lunch on top of a mall overlooking the city, ask the locals for the name and location.  We went to the Gallileo museum and the other massive art museum right next to it called the Uffizi.  I then walked to the top the hill above the Pitti Palace called plazza leonardo or something like that to watch the sunset
     Day five.  We take the train to Rome and take a guided tour of the colloseum.  Then I went to the Pantheon and promptley to bed.
     Day six we started by going to the lions mouth at hadrians crypt. Afterwards we went to the Italian tomb of the unknown soldier.  The top of this big white marble monument has great views. Then I went to Campo Di Fiori and then took a guided tour of the Vatican.  After climbing to the top of the Vatican we walked to the Spanish steps and the Trevi Fountain.  
       Day 7 is where I am now.  We rented a car and drove to Sorrento stoping in Ercalano to see the fabulous ruins of Herculan(Better then Pompeii.)  And now I am in my hotel.

Personally I think you are spending too long in some of your locations and should be able to go many different places.  Good luck.",0,1333565137,null,0,false,0,c48h0kn,t3_rru5g,t1_c48h0kn,t3_rru5g,null,1428655416,1,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,1

From what I remember having learnt in school, whenever the constitution is to be changed, then the suggested change(s) must receive a qualified majority vote in favour of it (don't remember if it was 66% or 75%). Then one needs to wait for a the next election to be held, upon which parliament must again vote on the same issue, where it must again win a qualified majority in favour. At last, the King must also agree to it, though he always does. Haven't heard of any case where he hasn't, not in modern times at least.

Don't remember if a referendum was needed or not, though I think the election more or less filled its role, since the party or coalition that supported the change would probably judged by the voters of that matter mostly.

So the insurance companies end up having to payout compensation in ""whiplash"" cases and that feeds its way through into premiums.

I'm not entirely sure what europe could do about it frankly, perhaps the easiest way would be to remove the ""no fee"" bit which ought to make people think twice before bringing spurious claims, but I'd have thought if it were that easy it would have been done, probably has knock on effects elsewhere.

Antiisraelismus bedeutet, gegen den Staat Israel zu sein, wie er jetzt ist, aber nicht gegen die Idee eines jüdischen Staats im Allgemeinen. Dies trifft wohl auf Grass und weite Teile der Deutschen zu.

Antizionismus bedeutet, generell gegen einen jüdischen Staat zu sein. Antizionisten gibt es sogar unter orthodoxen Juden. Ahmadinedjad (oder so) ist wohl Antizionist, aber nicht (radikaler) Antisemit - die jüdische Minderheit im Iran lebt weitgehend unbehelligt.

true,krattr,null,null,"Of course, you understand that space is limited and the medium has constraints. I'll try to clarify some points about Greece.

&gt; How many have restrictions on occupations?

Greece needs work here. It also asked for lower corporate tax (same as Ireland's), but EU's answer was no.

&gt; What is the extent of bribes or tax avasion?

Again, it depends. For example, German companies bribe officials in other countries, in order to sign lucrative deals. Switzerland is Europe's (actually, Earth's) laundering machine.

&gt; What has been the comparitive wage growth?

The introduction of Euro was considered beneficial for Greeks, but in reality the increase in the cost of living swept away any wage growth. EUR was introduced at 340.75 GRD, but soon the 50 eurocent coin became equal to a 50 drachmas coin.

&gt; What is the comparative productivity?

Again, it depends, it's not black or white for service-based economies. But I'm not arguing, I'm against a service-based economy. You can thank PASOK's government in the '80s for destroying heavy industries (yes, Greece had those).

&gt; What is private debt and what is public debt?

Greece is in a much better position here, most Greeks own their homes and private debt is low, compared to other countries. Private debt is a ticking bomb in Spain and the UK.

&gt; What is the difference in debt maturity?

There is an unfinished bond exchange program underway, we can't have any data right now. Bug me in a couple of months? :)

(However, Italy faces big problems this year.)

&gt; What is the comparative growth?

It was high, due to the construction sector's growth and the good climate after the Olympics. Following the US crisis in 2008, pieces of the domino started to fall.

&gt; What are the export and import numbers?

Tonnes of data in EUROSTAT/ELSTAT/OECD. Lots of imports, but comparable to other smaller states.

(See the point about interconnection: Germany exports, Greece buys.)

&gt; How much gold or assets do they own?

Greece's gold stocks decreased between 1998-2002 (pre-Euro era, PM's orders to sell). Assets: goldmine.

&gt; What are the levels of private savings?

Sky high. It was reported that Greeks transferred more than €100b outside Greece, in a year, due to the constant fear-mongering in the media.

&gt; What is the state of pension funds?

Supposedly, the recent ""haircut"" would lower state debt. Here's what they did to otherwise healthy pension funds: the state converted funds' deposits to government bonds, and forced them to take a cut. The result? These funds cannot function properly now and need increased state funding (!) although they didn't experience any problems before.

&gt; What are their historic ratings?

Good during the past decade. Greece could service its debt since the restoration of democracy (1974). The UK needed outside help from the IMF in 1976.

&gt; How hard is it for the public and private industry to restructure or lay off workers?

Workers had increased protection, following Scandinavian principles.

&gt; What are the minimum wages?

About €590 now, €100 more than Portugal's and €50 less than Spain's. But these numbers are meaningless, because they don't take into account the cost of life. A lower minimun wage might be sustainable for workers, only if prices of products were lower. It's pointless to compare minimum wages without comparing prices.

The story is much more complicated and there are many angles to it. But as many eminent economists say, the crisis is not national, its systemic.

Paracétamol is the American equivalent to Acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol.  For this reason, it would not be smart to take ibuprofen with your cold medicine.  However, I am not a licensed physician or pharmacist and this is not a subreddit for medical advice.  I understand why you would post here, though.


If you have questions concerning your medication, then go to a pharmacy and ask, ""Parlez-vous anglais?"" there is a pharmacy every 10 steps in this city, you're bound to hit a target eventually.  Pharmacists in France go through a much more rigorous education here than in America (they're even expected to know a lot about different varieties of mushrooms), so they are prepared to give you advice. 

From my experience, it depends on the pharmacy, but many times I walk out with homeopathic remedies instead of things like pseudoephedrine.  Instead of recommending typical cough syrup, they might recommend extract of ivy leaf which I've used and had good results from.

...what?

Even if it were true (which I doubt, because at that point in the war the Soviets had already killed twice that many German soldiers in open combat, and the German manpower base wasn't that large) how could it possibly be a direct comparison to the holocaust (and for that matter: if it were true then why would it be bad to compare them in the first place?

true,kultursafari,null,null,"I dj now for about 6 years. I mainly know about electronic music in Munich and Berlin so this is what I will focus on.

In general, you have two big groups of partygoers (as everywhere probably): People who go to socialize and people who enjoy the music. The first group is usually considerably bigger, except maybe for Berlin. Opening times are around 11. Closing time between 4 and 6. In Berlin most parties go longer, 1 pm the next day is not too uncommon. 

Munich first because the list is shorter:

* Medium sized electronic scene (mostly tech/house), notable clubs include **[Harry Klein](http://harrykleinclub.de/)** and **[Rote Sonne](http://www.rote-sonne.com/)**. A lot of new clubs popped up during the last years: Bobbeaman, Chaka Chaka, Kong, Herr Hotter etc
*  Like always, there is also enough clubs to accomodate the masses playing popular music. Somewhat famous are Milchbar, Nachtgalerie and Crowns Club.

Berlin in contrast is famous for the vast supply of clubs playing music of all genres. The majority will play electronic music.

* **[Berghain/Panorama Bar](http://berghain.de/)**, **[Watergate](http://www.water-gate.de/)** and **[Weekend](http://www.week-end-berlin.de/)** probably belong in the top30 clubs worldwide. 
  * Especially Berghain certainly earned its spot. If you're hardcore enough, you enter friday and leave monday. NO cameras allowed inside whatsoever. Famous for its sound system, drug use and gay scene (2 dark rooms). Also for being notoriously hard to get in.
*  Huge amount of quality clubs serving electronic music at least every fr &amp; sa: **Golden Gate**, **Ritter Butzke**, **Kater Holzig** or **Tresor**
*  Various big roomed mass discos playing popular tunes: fritzclub, soda
*  Fairly solid rock/indie scene with magnet, cafe burger
*  Berlin also serves other genres like HipHop and Reggae

Famous clubs in other cities:

*  Hamburg has **[Übel &amp; Gefährlich](http://www.uebelundgefaehrlich.com/)** and **[Ego](http://www.mein-ego.com/)**
*  Frankfurt (and around) has **[Cocoon](http://www.cocoon.net/club)**, **[Robert Johnson](http://www.robert-johnson.de/)**, **[U 60311](http://u60311.net/)** and **[Kamehameha](http://www.king-kamehameha.de/)**

Discussing whether Israel should attack Iran is actually pretty boring. Any rational person (even Israeli military officials) knows that an attack would just destabilize the region and would *not* stop Iran from pursuing their nuclear program. At the most it would delay it and make them more adamant in finishing it. There is really no need for discussion here.

The fact that some in the Israeli government are nonetheless considering an attack shows that rational arguments won't help. They are simply playing into the emotions of their electorate. Therefore, the only thing that could possibly avoid an attack is political pressure by Israel's allies (preferably the USA). That's what Grass calls for and I fully agree with him. 

However, the fact that Germany still has problems coping with its history, is a much more interesting topic for discussion, in my opinion.

Your Actifed rhume Jour &amp; Nuit contain paracetamol for the fever and pain, pseudoephedrine for the day tablets as a decongestant, and diphenhydramine for the night ones as an antihistamine. The day one might keep you awake if you take it in the evening. Don't take more than three day and one night tablets a day, and don't drink alcohol.

The paracetamol in the tablets does what ibuprofen would do, so there's no need to take it in addition to that. Homeopathy is a scam.

I have very grave doubts about the credibility of Eurostat.

OK, so we all know about how Eurostat turned a blind eye to bad numbers that were coming out of Greece prior to Greece joining the euro.

I suspect the rot runs deeper than that.

Eurostat's numbers have a lot of peuk in them.

Eurostat has the UK's debt to GDP ratio at &gt; 80% but the UK government has the number at &lt; 65%.

If anyone wants to google into Eurostat's definition of UK debt, Eurostat includes the bailout money for the UK's banks in the UK's debt, like xorgoi says.

Now if the UK government had borrowed that money on the international markets and has a date to repay it by, it's a debt and Eurostat would be correct.

But as I understand it, the UK government just printed the money and chucked it at the floundering banks.

At some point, the banks are gonna repay that money to the British government because appalling incompetence aside, banking in the UK is generally a profitable business.

So rather than being a part of the UK debt, those numbers seem to me a part of the UK credit.

There is also an exacerbation of Eurostat's interpretation of the debt due the diminution of the banks share price but I suspect I've been technical enough already.

So in a nutshell ... blah ... blah ... blah ....(to hopefully establish some technical credibility) .... Eurostat's numbers have a lot of peuk in them.

And we've all known that for ages.

true,champ-ooh,null,null,"Let me enlighten you about the German Bauerndisco or Dorfdisco!

Dorfdiscos (Villagediscos) and Bauerndiscos (Farmerdiscos) are clubs that reside in the smaller and more rural areas of Germany. They exist in a wide variety of shapes and forms! 

From tiny one-dancefloor establishment with a musical backdrop somewhere between [90's-dance](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMPM1q_Uyxc) and [songs you can sing along to even when two bouncers are dragging you to the toilet for puking all over the dancefloor](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-418rybwVI) to multi-dancefloor discos with separate areas devoted to playing your favourite [dance](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHOgkgnZAdc), [rock](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfrIipujxfQ) and [rnb](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsO6ZnUZI0g) tracks.

One thing is commonly found in EVERY rural club-establishment: the German [Bauer/farmer](http://i.imgur.com/FMNY7.jpg). German farmers exist in a variety of ages, shapes and forms and you'll meet every single one of them at your local Dorfdisco. They usually appear in groups and dedicate their whole clubbing experience to hogging one bar (or corner of the club) where they will take rounds in ordering [Korn](http://i.imgur.com/x3K46.jpg) (cheap hard liquor). These farmers might be as young as 15 or as old as 65. Over the course of the night there will be several small amusing events out of the order. Here are two examples:

1.  One of the farmers might pass out and his fellow drinking buddies will laugh for half an hour at his inability to down extreme amounts of highly intoxicating alcohol. The weakest farmers are usually found besides trees or in corners behind the Bauerndisco the next morning.

2. Some farmers are brave enough to stumble to the dancefloor to re-enact [random 90's tv show and movie dance scenes](http://i.imgur.com/I0pxE.gif) from memory. This usually results in highly amusing 15 to 20 minutes for all bystanders and results in either the Bauer getting too sober to continue or him puking and passing out.

The female population in Dorfdiscos consists of girls aged 15 to 23 (single) and women aged 40 to 65 (married). I have no fucking clue what happens to girls outside of those age groups and I don't want to engage in conspiracy theories. As mentioned, the usual female visitor of a Bauerndisco can be grouped in one of the following groups:

1. Already engaged and able to drink insane amounts of hard alcohol with her husband and group of farmers.
2. Sober and single roaming the Dorfdisco till they have chosen their preferred group of farmers to get hammered with.

That's pretty much all there is to it. Two more facts for you:

* German farmers are able to drink insane amounts of hard liquor (usually AT LEAST one 0.7 liter bottle/a pint and three quarters of 32% alcohol)
* ""Vorsaufen""  (pre-drinking) is an activity where the German farmer sits at home with his buddies and drinks till they're ready to hit the club (average consumption at Vorsaufen is already one 0.7 bottle per farmer).

[He's not a farmer but watch this video of a local Dorfdisco incident to get an idea of the average crowd.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdEbHxX64ME) The guy states that he got kicked out for drinking and dancing. When asked what he'll do next he proudly says ""i'll work illicitly on monday again, gotta get up early.""

**What must be said, Günter Grass**

Why am I silent, I have too long kept quiet about

That which is obvious, and in wargames

Is practiced, and in whose end as survivors

We are footnotes at best.

.

It is the asserted right to the preemptive strike,

Which could obliterate the Iranian people,

Enslaved by a braggart

And forced into organized revelry,

Because the construction of an atomic bomb

Is suspected to be within its power.

.

But why do I forbid myself

To call that other land by its name,

Which for years, though secretly,

Has been a growing nuclear power

Out of control, because no evidence

Is open to the public?

.

The universal concealment of this state of affairs,

To which my silence was subordinate,

I see as a tremendous lie

And duress, the punishment announced

Is immediately ignored;

The verdict ""antisemitism"" is familiar.

.

But now, because from my country,

Those crimes of its very own,

Which are without comparison,

Are dragged out time and time again and it is confronted with them,

Then once more purely businesslike, when the

Amends are announced by agile lips;

Yet another submarine to Israel

Will be delivered, the specialty of which

Consists hereof: to be able to guide

All-annihilating warheads to the place where the existence

Of one single atom bomb is unproven,

Still, for fear of what the significance will be,

I say what must be said.

.

But why have I been silent until now?
    
I had thought, my ancestry,

Which is afflicted with a taint that never will be redeemed,

Prohibited this fact as spoken truth

At the expectation of the land Israel,

To which I am bound, and will remain so.

.

Why do I first speak now,

Older and with last ink: 

The atomic power of Israel imperils

The already fragile world peace?

Because it must be said,

What tomorrow still could be too late;

Also because we - as Germans are burdened enough -

Could become accessories to a crime

Which is foreseeable, and in which case our complicity

By any of the usual excuses

Could not be redeemed.

.

And therefore I am no longer silent, 

Because I, of the hypocrisy of the West,

Am weary; thereby it is hoped,

That many will find it possible to free themselves from silence,

To challenge to abandon fear

The real cause of the recognizable danger, and

Equally insist thereupon:

That unrestricted and permanent supervision

Of Israeli atomic potential

And the Iranian atomic plants

Through an international agency,

Will be permitted by the governments of both countries.

.

Only in this way can everyone, the Israelis and the Palestinians,

Still more, all people, who in this

Delusion-haunted region

Close to each other live as enemies,

And lastly, also ourselves, be helped.

The Norman invasion of England in 1066 changed our language from a very Dutch-like language, where the roots and parts of words were taken from Old English and had meaning in English in their own rite, to the state we're in now, where we use Latin roots, either because they were introduced by the Romans or through the French.

How much do you know about how American politics work? Particularly the Republican Party, who isn't crazy about latinos, knows Puerto Ricans would always vote Democratic, and control the House?

I'll ask directly: if I tell the Irish people that they can only leave with the explicit permission of the EU, do you think they'd be insulted? Or that the EU reserves the right to at any point dissolve your government if it strikes their fancy to do so? Or overturn any law (not through a court, through their own legislators) without any checks and balances whatsoever to it? Or that, ultimately, your head of government is going to be completely unelected (the President of the US overrules our Governor)? Or that your Constitution is lesser and inferior to any single law they pass without your input?

You can sit there and honestly tell me that the Irish would accept it and not care simply because most of them don't want to leave the EU?

You're confusing desire for independence with desire for democracy. I prefer statehood; if impossible, a free association; if impossible, independence. Being a colony is unacceptable.

That's utter horseshit. The US currently develops new bunker busters because the existing ones are incapable of penetrating Iranian underground facilities. Furthermore the US has discussed using tactical nuclear weapons in order to destroy those installations.

While Israel might not have openly discussed nuclear options it is naive to assume they don't have plans. If the most advanced military on earth, the US military, does not have conventional or nuclear weapons to deliver a successful first strike which would destroy all intended targets it is highly unlikely that Israel does. It is far more likely that they have plans in place in case a conventional first strike is unsuccessful and retaliation is imminent. To believe that Israel has nuclear weapons but doesn't have plans of attack on how to use them for maximum efficiency is just plain stupid.

Ok, but this is the difference you are ignoring; those are sovereign countries that can trade with their neighbours and vote at the UN, and we are not. We were invaded a century ago, and have been a colony ever since.

While Turkey waits to join (if ever), they develop their ties to the Arab world, and with Iran, and we... what? Keep on applying laws passed by a country in which we have no representation?

The bar's higher because if the EU says no, the country in question goes along their merry way. If the US says no, we get stuck with an unelected body over us forever. And this is fair? Why should *we* have to prove ourselves to *them* when we were the ones invaded?

&gt; As to legal supremacy, European law trumps any national law anywhere, including the Irish constitution (this is explicitly stated in the third amendment, since we joined in 1973.)

That is not entirely true. A fair amount of countries have said that their Constitution trumps European law (although it's never put into practice). And, once more, you're ignoring a crucial issue; **you** chose to pass an amendment for such purposes, no? As a sovereign country, you chose to give up part of your sovereignty to be an equal member of a supranational body. We were invaded and made a colony. How do you not see the difference?

true,MeteorPhoenix,PUER,Puerto Rico,"Naturally, I plan on voting, but I think you're oversimplifying a very complex, and old situation. As I have said, the independence movement was once persecuted and nearly destroyed. During this time, English was made into the only language to be taught in the schools and people were raised with the fear of Puerto Rico becoming a banana republic. People were arrested for being ""subversive"". The then statehood party contributed to that fear with the tacit approval of the American government. It didn't matter. Many Republicans (the Puerto Rican party, not the American one) that were pro-statehood left and joined the independence movement because it was plainly clear that statehood would not be granted (partly because they didn't want to deal with some of their other colonies too). Then some in the independence movement, seeing no way out, started carrying out outright terrorist attacks (again, idiots).

The referendums you're referring too (obviously, non-binding) started after *all* of this, so I find your comments a bit unfair. You're offering a referendum to people who think independence means being third world, think statehood means either solving all your problems or losing your culture, and think the status quo is terrible but are afraid of change.

Is this consent? Yeah. Do I blame today's America for it? No. I'll vote for statehood in November, and hope the referendum passes. At the same time, I hope the less racist Dems win in Nov and that the one who proposed the referendum in the House of Representatives (who is from not my party, but who gives a shit) wins as well. Maybe with all the planets aligned, there'll actually be change, but who knows?

For it reveals in the one thus afflicted the lack of individual qualities of which he could be proud, while he would not otherwise reach for what he shares with so many millions. He who possesses significant personal merits will rather recognise the defects of his own nation, as he has them constantly before his eyes, most clearly. But that poor blighter who has nothing in the world of which he can be proud, latches onto the last means of being proud, the nation to which he belongs to.

The wars and all. Yes, it belongs to the history of Germany, but keep in mind that everybody who is younger than 67 was born *after WWII ended*. So young people today can identify with the country/nationality/flag without feeling guilty.

Berghain/Panoramabar wouldn't be infamous as it is if they just let everyone in. But then you have to bear in mind that Berlin is a city of more than 3.5 Million people, with easily a million more coming in on every given weekend as tourists or from the surrounding areas. And then you have a bunch of world renowned clubs that have been in every tourist  guide for years, so you have people just flocking to them. Thus: They can afford not to let everyone in. The majority of clubs, you won't have any trouble getting into, though - Magnet is right next door to Watergate and is an alright, run-of-the-mill type club where lots of people go once they've been rejected at Watergate. The mix of people won't be as interesting as it is in Watergate or Berghain, but it's still a fun place to be. It's just that there are lots of somewhat exclusive, very high quality clubs that are more selective with their crowds.

Tresor is another example of an infamous club, but from my experience they'll let everyone in. The time I've been there has been a total sausagefest for that very reason.

Was erfahren wir im Gedicht über Juden und Deutsche? Grass schreibt von deutschen Opfern und jüdischen Tätern. 

Deutsche kommen vor als ""Überlebende"" und ""Fußnoten"" eines Verbrechens, als wegen ihrer ""Herkunft"" ungerecht Behandelte. (Anspielungen auf Holocaust-""Überlebende"", wegen ihrer ""Herkunft"" verfolgte Juden in Nazi-Deutschland, Charlotte Knoblochs Warnung 2008, die Holocaust-Opfer könnten zu ""Fußnoten der Geschichte"" werden.)

Juden hingegen kommen vor als Vorbereiter eines ""voraussehbaren"" Verbrechens, als Vernichter eines gesamten Volkes. (Offensichtliche Anspielung auf Nazi-Deutschland.)

Josef Joffe in ""Die Zeit"":
&gt; [Und Deutschland wäre der ""Zulieferer eines Verbrechens"", ""mitschuldig"" zum zweiten Mal. Etwa so: Die erste Endlösung war ein deutsches Projekt, die zweite halten jetzt die Juden für die Iraner bereit. Das alte Opfer ist der neue Täter, der Kreis hat sich geschlossen.](http://www.zeit.de/politik/ausland/2012-04/guenter-grass-gedicht-israel/komplettansicht)

Grass' Motiv erklärt von Jan Fleischhauer auf ""Spiegel Online"":

&gt; [Er [Grass] gehört zu einer Generation von Männern, die es nie verwunden haben, dass sie am Beginn ihrer Karriere auf der falschen Seite standen.  (...) Es braucht ziemlich viel Phantasie, um Iran zum Opfer israelischer Vernichtungspläne zu machen, aber diese Verdrehungen gehorchen einer vertrackten Logik. Wenn die Juden die eigentlichen Aggressoren sind, dann wiegt die eigene Schuld nicht mehr so groß. Erst diese Moralverschiebung erlaubt es, wieder mit gutem Gewissen durch die Welt zu wackeln und andere Mores zu lehren. ](http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,825879,00.html)

Ich verstehe nicht ganz wo er von deutschen Opfern und jüdischen Tätern schreibt. 

Also ich sehe das im Moment so:

Ich bin tatsächlich zu wenig informiert, aber wenn Israel sich wirklich aus atomaren Abrüstungsabkommen raushält und wenn die Lieferung eines Atom U-Bootes von Deutschland an Israel der Wahrheit entspricht, finde ich Kritik daran richtig, auch wenn die Gefahr eines atomaren Angriffs Israels auf den Iran, nach dem was du schreibst, so gut wie ausgeschlossen ist. Allein die Möglichkeit zu so einem Angriff zu unterstützen finde ich falsch.

Wenn sowohl das mit den Abrüstungsabkommen, als auch das mit dem Atom U-Boot nicht stimmt, dann ist die Verurteilung des Textes richtig.

Vielleicht kannst du diese beiden Punkte ja auch noch aufklären?

EDIT: In diesem [Artikel](http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,825780,00.html) werden meine Fragen beantwortet. Insgesamt komme ich zu dem Schluss, dass die Kritik an Grass gerechtfertigt ist, bleibe aber dabei, dass auf Kritik an Israel, nach meinem Empfinden, überzogen reagiert wird.

* The Hofbräuhaus is a tourist trap.  There are much better places to drink beer in Munich.
* Oktoberfest is not a good destination for beer drinking.  It is however a good destination if you enjoy being groped by drunken tourists while you pay too much for the experience.  Much better destinations exist, like the [Erlangen Bergkirchweih](http://www.der-berg-ruft.de/).  Also, the [Franconian Beer Festival](http://www.xn--bierfest-nrnberg-szb.de/) in Nuremberg usually has around 30 breweries, all of which are either from Franconia or sister-cities around the world, and is quite nice as well. 
* For beer museums in Franconia, the [Bavarian Brewery Museum](http://www.bayerisches-brauereimuseum.de/) in Kulmbach is better than the Franconian Brewery museum if you can only go to one beer museum in your life.  Bonus: Their ""Museum Beer"", which is brewed in small batches and only sold at the museum, is excellent.
* Weltenburg brewery is definitely worth a visit, although their beer isn't really that good in my opinion.
* Kölsch is not really a reason to visit Cologne.  It's something to try when you're in Cologne, but it hardly makes the city a ""beer destination"".
* Jever is crap, although not as crap as Becks.  I can think of a dozen better pils off the top of my head, and some of the breweries even offer tours. 
* Becks isn't beer.  It's water with beer flavoring drunk primarily by teenagers, people who don't really enjoy beer, and by people who have to drive their car in a few hours.  You can find better beer for €0,30 per plastic bottle at the local discount grocery store, and that stuff is *terrible*.
* If you want to have a proper German beer tour, you need to go to the [Fränkische Schweiz](http://www.fraenkische-schweiz.com/).  Franconia has 287 breweries according to my copy of *Brauns Brauerei Atlas Franken (2010)*, making it the region with the most breweries in the world.  Something like 70 of them are in the Fränkische Schweiz, and there are ""brewery trails"" where you can go on a 10km or 15km hike and visit several.  This activity is called ""bierwandern"" and it's a great way to enjoy the Franconian countryside.  If you get lucky with your timing, you can often find very small breweries that only sell their beer a few days a year, usually out of the basement of the brewer's house, or you can find slightly larger breweries that sell such odd beers as [this ""Erotic Beer""](http://www.lang-braeu.de/ebier.htm)(from a brewery in a village some distance NW of Bayreuth).

But wrt to your first paragraph, however, I disagree: you said it yourself, the exact wording matters a lot in this context, so if Grass writes the following sentence, verbatim, ""Die Atommacht Israel gefährdet den ohnehin brüchigen Weltfrieden?"", and if I assume he chooses his words on purpose (which I do, because he is, after all, a capable writer), then it matters a lot that those words are the exact phrasing that was used in the Europe-wide poll done about 2 years ago in which a large number of Europeans stated that they feel ""Israel is the biggest threat to world peace right now"". (If you don't remember it, I'll do a search and find a link. Not sure if my guess ""2 years"" is accurate, maybe someone else can help me out here). 

In other words, if he would have used a different phrasing, I probably would agree with you, but he didn't, he used a charged phrase, one that refers back to a rather popular (but IMO wrong) sentiment (Israel being the single biggest threat/aggressor in the middle east conflict), and by my initial assumption, that his words are chosen carefully for effect, I conclude that he *does* indeed claim that ""Israel is a threat to world peace"".

On a sort of related note, did you see the Titanic poem that parodies his style? ([link here](http://www.titanic-magazin.de/newsticker.html?&amp;tx_ttnews[cat]=30&amp;cHash=f3c1858eb7f9fe782dab24fc7fd7906d)) It takes the general approach of the real Grass poem (i.e. on the surface of the poem, saying things that are arguably true, like for example that Germans might not feel entirely comfortable giving submarines that can carry nuclear warheads to an unchecked &amp; unofficial nuclear power, but then adding a layer of subtext, by means of charged words and phrases, that are much more controversial -- to name just one: the title itself, that sounds almost the same as the warcry of a German Stammtisch ""Man wird doch wohl noch sagen dürfen""), but then the Titanic version takes it a step further, and makes the pathetic revisionist subtext more obvious (by talking, still indirectly, about how Hitler gave us the Autbahn, and other old revisionist memes).

true,barsoap,SCHL,Sleswig-Holsteen,"&gt; Israel being the single biggest threat/aggressor in the middle east conflict

Grass doesn't say ""biggest"" in any way whatsoever. In fact, him saying that it endangers the ""anyhow brittle"" world peace softens his verdict, as that leads to the inversion: ""If world peace weren't so brittle, nuclear Israel wouldn't endanger it"". As such, he isn't referring, implicitly or explicitly, to some poll (which has no relationship to his text but that which people choose to construct) and the rest of your argument thus doesn't follow. A certain recklessness of the Israeli right is criticized by the ""anyhow"", yes, but that's one of those things one absolutely should criticise. They certainly did forget where they put their velvet gloves.

I generally recommend everyone who wants to say anything about the middle east to criticise *every single one* there in one breath. 

&gt; a layer of subtext

I don't see a layer of subtext in Grass' poem short of conveying a lot of unease, but I surely see how the necessarily high-brow style makes it easy to suspect subtext.

You can also see the titanic version from another POV: They're showing how antisemites would've written the whole thing... and Grass did not.

Von Bevormundung kann meiner Meinung nach nicht die Rede sein. Jeder erwartet an Feiertagen frei zu haben und auch am Sonntag. (Ich meine dass wir Sonntags frei haben, worauf ist denn das zurück zu führen? - ""Am siebenten Tage sollst du ruhen!"").

Keiner würde an einem neuen Feiertag irgendeine Bevormundung akzeptieren. Auch wenn das woanders jahrhundertelange Tradition sein mag.

Und natürlich hat der freie Sonntag ihren Ursprung in der Kirche. Das war's dann aber auch. Wir und unsere Kultur haben sich weiterentwickelt. Tanken dürfen Sonntags auf haben, vollkommen zurecht. Nur die allerwenigsten, auch von den Christen, halten sich an die ""Bevormundung"" der Kirche, am Sonntag Gott zu ehren und in die Kirche zugehen, und dass ist auch vollkommen in Ordnung so.

Wir stehen an einem ganz anderem Punkt inzwischen. Wir dürfen deswegen nicht direkt unsere eigene Kultur abschaffen, der Sonntag soll Sonntag bleiben. Aber man darf und muss darüber Diskutieren, ob es noch Zeitgemäß ist, dass die Kirche uns Karfreitag das Schweigen auferlegen darf!

EDIT: Naja und zu der Bevormundung nochmal: Natürlich will keiner diese Feiertage missen! Aber warum christlich. Die Anzahl unserer Feiertage können gesellschaftlich &amp; wirtschaftlich ausdiskutiert werden. Diese Zahl nehmen wir dann und ersetzen alle christlichen Feiertage mit staatlichen!
