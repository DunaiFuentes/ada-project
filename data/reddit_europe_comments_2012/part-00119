3) Germany devides studying into 2 different ways. The first one is the university (Universität). The content of the courses at a university tend to be very theoretical, it is a good start to go into science.  
We have also a ""Fachhochschule"". In this type of school your content will be practical, for going into work right after your degree. You can still continue studying (Bachelor -&gt; Master degree), and when you have your Bachelor you can attend your Master degree on every University and Fachhochschule offering it.  
  
Regarding the requirements you have to read each university's or Fachhochschule's requirement list individually. In Bremerhaven there are not many requirements. You have to have a certain school knowledge (Fachhochschulreife) and then you can join. For you as foreigner there will be other requirements I think.  
  
And I think you can always work in Germany. I think it is not hard to get a visum and study / work here, or even get the German nationality if you want so, but I don't really know. You should talk to a consulate for your country, or the German consulate in Israel, they might know it and can tell you.

4) That extremely depends on where you want to live. As soon as you know that I would look for a ""Studentenheim"" or a ""Studenten-WG"". A Studentenheim is a big complex for many many students, where they can live relatively cheap. A Studenten-WG is a group of students living together in a house or a flat. Everyone has its own room, and they share bath, kitchen and living room, and of course the rent.  
  
electricity, water, gas (for heating) and internet also depends on where and how you live. There is cheap, fast internet, there is also expensive slow internet. You can chose from many providers and should talk to someone as soon as you live there. There are also regional providers, providing just for a city, so I can't make a general answer.  
  
You get food everywhere and there is always cheap food and expensive food. Even if you really like food: Don't always go for the expensive. Try everything out and buy the things you like most, sometimes the cheaper is WAY better than the expensive version. We have brands like ""Ja!"", ""Gut &amp; Günstig"", ""TIP"" and ""real,- quality"", which are ""noname brands"" by the supermarket you buy in, they are cheaper and the package doesn't look as brilliant as the expensive brands, but sometimes it is the SAME content.

Don't think for a second that Americans talk for everybody else, just because you fell to Germany in WW2 and you didn't joined their war in Iraq they came to the retarded conclusion that you always surrender.

true,datenwolf,null,null,"&gt; 1) I'm Middle-eastern. A christian Arab from Israel. Are there Middle-eastern people in Germany or are they very rare, and also, do German people hate or aren't friendly to middle-eastern people? any discrimination against them or such?

Here in Germany live a substancial number of people of middle-eastern heritage, mostly from turkey and egypt, though. It all began back in the 1960-ies, when Germany had a lack in working forces and invited foreign people to live and work here.

Like all countries also in Germany there are people who frown upon foreigners. However in most cities, especially those with universities you'll hardly run into this kind of problem.

&gt; 2) I'm personally interested in computers, computer science, programming software or hardware, pretty much anything computer-related. Can you tell me about the universities that have such courses and what not? (and city if it's not obvious)

About all larger German universities have some computer science department, and even the smaller ones usually do. After all computers are cheap and CS is mostly math.

&gt; 3) How hard is it to study in Germany? As in, is it very hard to get accepted to a German university of any sort (like you need superior grades,etc) and how hard would it be if I was to stay in Germany and work there?

What you need is something equivalent to the German ""Hochschulreife"" i.e. finished high-school with grades qualifying you for a study at a university. Some subjects add additional demands on your grades, for example law or medicine. But computer science is not among them. In general if your grades would allow you to attend university in your own country, you can also study at a university in the EU.

&gt; 4) Are the basic needs for living expensive? things like rent/electricity/internet/food/water/etc

Depends on the city and your accomodation. Munich is a quite expensive city to live at when it comes to rents, Berlin is affordable (also a lot of middle-eastern people living there).

There are several utility vendors for electricity in Germany, with a varying price span; you may estimate about 0.25 €/kWh give or take. Heating is usually not electrical, so your electricity bill can be quite low, especially if you don't have a lot of appliances.

If you get to live in a student community you usually get Internet for free; if not, then a landline isn't that expensive as well: You can get a flatrate telephone + Internet landline for as few as 25 €/month. Also you get free Internet access at the university.

Costs for food depend on what you buy where. Germany has sort of a 3-fold shopping culture. There are the small corner stores, your regular supermarket and the discounters. Some discounters offer very good quality for really low prices. As a student you normally buy your food there.

And with Germany getting a lot of downpour water is, well, cheap. However despite its low price of about only 1€/m³ (1m³ = 1000l), tap water is also the most thoroughly checked comestible, in fact tap water in Germany is cleaner than most bottled water sold in Germany. There's no need to filter tap water or drink only bottled water. The only thing of concern is the state of your houses plumbing. However every city's utility vendor offers free, or very cheap testing services for water samples from your home, which I recommend you make use of. If the water coming out of your pipes is not clean it is the duty of the houseowner to fix it, without passing down the costs!

Which brings me to your rights as a tenant. First and foremost: Nobody other than you has the right to get access to your home*. Not even your landlord may enter your apartment without your permission. Next important point: Once you've moved in, you can not be evicted from your home ""the next day""; even if you're behind schedule paying your rent, or the landlord needs the apartment himself, you can not be forced to leave your home without a few weeks notice (IIRC 3 months actually). Also if you're paying your rent dutifully and are living in a large apartment complex, then nothing and nobody can force you to move out. I'm telling you this, because some landlords are real douchebags and some of them try to exploit especially foreigners counting on them not knowing their rights. Should you ever run into problems with your landlord get immediate contact with your local ""Mieterverein"".

true,datenwolf,null,null,"&gt;  How exactly is the weather there 

Mixed :)

It can get as low as -30 °C in the winter, but usual ""cold"" winter nights go down to -15 °C. In northern Germany the weather is milder than in the south, due to being close to the ocean (northern and baltic sea), so it doesn't get colder than -5 °C there usually.

Your typical summer day will be between 25 °C to 35 °C, with exceptional hot days reaching some 40 °C.

&gt; and is there extreme changes between different regions/cities?

Every region has its typical weather, but changes are mostly gradual. The big exception is of course when you cross steep changes in altitude, but that's more of an issue when you go mountain climbing, not when traveling across the country. What you should be prepared for is, that the weather is not evenly distributed. It can very well be that you enter the train in Munich with a nice, sunny 27 °C, and exit it 6 hours later in Berlin with chilly 10 °C and rain. And when you travel home the next day it very well may be exactly the other way round.

&gt; Also, does it snow?

Yes, in the winter, but due to climate change not as much as it used to say 20 years ago. You should definitely get a good windproof rain jacket, that's kind of the most important piece of outdoor clothing to own. I also recommend to follow the onion principle in the winter and layer your clothing. I found the layering undershirt → T-shirt → pullover → windproof rain jacket a lot more comfortable and practical than just a pullover and a thick snow jacket. T-shirt and pullover should be cotton to transport away sweat. Windproof rain jackets with Gore-Tex allow the sweat to evaporate but prevent the layers of warm air building up in your clothing to be blown away.",0,1346802113,null,0,false,0,c63is8h,t3_zcsrz,t1_c63is8h,t1_c63i3yx,null,1429818326,2,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,2
true,almodozo,null,null,"That combo is colloquially called ""Purple Plus"" - a reference to the 'purple' governments of the 90s that had just VVD, D66 and PvdA.

That said, politics has changed quite a bit since the 90s. Rutte's VVD is more right-wing than Dijkstal's VVD was in the 90s, and Samsom's PvdA is more left-wing than Kok's PvdA was in the 90s. So coalition talks would be a lot harder than they were back then. Right now, Samsom and Rutte are basically fighting each other head-on in the campaign.

For the VVD, the problem with this option would be that it would look like it's basically joining a center-left coalition, after it's successfully carved out an anchoring position as the country's strongest right-wing party. That's arguably more a problem of appearances than realities, since D66 and GL are already lending their parliamentary support to Prime Minister Rutte's government even now, and seem to have both accepted the logic of austerity and the 3% norm, especially D66. Still, governing with the PvdA would hit the VVD hard electorally, as many of its right-wing voters would flee to the Freedom Party or perhaps the CDA.

The PvdA would face something like a mirror image of this dilemma. It would be the only party favouring a more Keynesian economic line in a government of otherwise self-proclaimed economic 'reformers' eager to cut budgets. It would stand alone in arguing that the 3% deficit rule is not sacred. Participating in such a government would risk making some of the party's working-class left-wing voters to defect to the SP after all. (This is why I'm guessing the PvdA will be eager to pull the SP into any government it enters too, just like the VVD will do with the CDA.)

Not saying that it's impossible - everything is possible in Dutch government negotiations. For the PvdA, it would certainly be a more attractive option than the VVD-CDA-D66-PvdA combo that's being mentioned quite a bit now. The VVD might have to accept it, if the PvdA refuses a combo that has the CDA instead. But while a ""liberal"" label may to some extent seem to fit all these parties (or at least VVD and D66, and increasingly GL too), it hides some pretty stark differences.",0,1346802190,null,0,false,0,c63isye,t3_zb6tk,t1_c63isye,t1_c639w51,null,1429818338,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Then WHY are you protecting people who do hate them!

Want those people to change? Then STOP SAYING ITS OKAY. My friend, Jamilla her name is, was saying EXACTLY THIS. Muslims behave like this because they see it as the RIGHT way to behave.

I mean, obviously they're doing something smarter than rewarding the states that have the most debt, but I still don't know how exactly they're doing it.

This is simplified and leaves out a few exceptions, but federal spending applies equally to all states.  The government will establish a health care assistance program for seniors, for example, and qualifying seniors from every state will be able to access it.  A certain formula will be used to calculate how much money the fed will give to assist education; this formula might yield different results in different states, but the same formula will be applied to each state.  All states can lobby for profitable government contracts for their local businesses.  Instead of calling it a bailout, we might better characterize it as targeted support for specific things that the federal government considers important.  People see it that way rather than as certain states bailing out other states.

Also, remember that Americans consider themselves citizens of the US first and foremost, and only citizens of their local states as an afterthought, in most cases.  That is the opposite of Europe's attitude, where people are first and foremost Germans, English, Scottish, Greek, etc., and only European as an afterthought, in most cases.  There is not so much concern about distributing taxes around the US because those of us who aren't crazy Republicans do not object to our tax dollars being used to help fellow Americans, so long as it is done in a responsible and constructive manner.

People say that Islam advocates executions etc. So does the bible etc. You take a few events in a few countries, and sais that ""This is what Islam represents"". To me, it's more that Islam represents when it runs amok.

Some muslims come here, and shout that they want Sharia law. I don't care. It's pathetic and a little frightening, but in the end they can shout all they want. In the end, they will never get it. And they will still have to abide with our laws, wether they like it or not.

We have Neo-Nazis walking around propagating for a new holocaust etc. Yet their race/beliefs is never brought up. They are just, rightfully so, seen as complete idiots.

I only have one problems with the current way Islam is treated, apart from the obvious racism towards middle-eastern people:
And that is that it's seemingly allowed for a Muslim to propagate hate-speech. It shouldn't be allowed for anyone.

Yes, we all want them to Intergrate. But it's easy to be a saint in heaven. And to some people, there is no level of intergration good enough. To some, it seems like as long as they're not white, they don't belong here. 

Some of you dislike their religion and don't want it in your country. However, imagine that if you had to move to, say, Iraq, would you then start going to a Mosque every sunday(?) and pray 5 times per day, because that is their culure? Most likely you wouldn't. Would your wife wear a Burqha, because that's their culture? If not, why do you expect them to cease wearing one?

You expect them to work, yet nobody wants to hire them.

And finally: No, i don't like many things about Islam. There are tons of things that i hate about the culture of many immigrants that come here.

Greece needs to slash labour costs but nominal wages are sticky above equilibrium and reducing non-wage labour costs through austerity maligns unit productivity further.

A mandatory reduction in work hours is an effective market mechanism to adjust real wages. An unemployed worker will not expect to earn a ""full-time salary"" nor will the company pay it. 

For example, let us say that a part-time job offering 25% of the ""full-time"" salary + benefits is better than unemployment (0%). Unemployed workers will begin to accept part-time jobs at adjusted real wages while former employees will be forced to accept reduced hours at an overpaid salary until equilibrium is reached.

An example of my own life - i traveled to Iran this summer, while their government is very, very strict, the people were not. They were real muslims - living by the koran, meaning that a traveler(in this case, me) was always welcome, and was to be offered foods and whatnot. Now, this is islam.

Islam politically, yes, is awful. But have in mind that it is not because of *this* particular religion - it could be any. They just need to say *in the name of* **something** .

But then again, I do agree. My country is too soft on radicals who bitch about our society and the way we live, not letting their daughters barely go out the door, and beat them up if they end up talking to a danish boy.

true,redlightsaber,ESPA,Spain,"I hear you. But some of the concerns are legitimate, I think. And in your very post there a couple of unfair comparisons.

&gt; People say that Islam advocates executions etc. So does the bible etc.

Yet there aren't very many executions done in western countries for those reasons, are they? The different religions can be interpreted, and it's true that there are *some* ""flavours"" of islam that are relatively progressive and wouldn't pose much trouble for a western society. I don't think executions are the big complaint however, but rather the misoginy. This is not ""isolated groups"" of islam which treat women like objects that we're talking about here. We're talking, virtually everyone who hasn't outright for the most part divorced islam, doesn't think it right for a woman to go out alone in public. Or without a burqa (or niquab), or to date. Or drive. I'd love to be proven wrong on this bit, please do if you have available info.

&gt; Some muslims come here, and shout that they want Sharia law. In the end, they will never get it.

&gt; We have Neo-Nazis walking around propagating for a new holocaust etc. Yet their race/beliefs is never brought up.

For the most part, I agree with this. But it doesn't mean the discourse shouldn't be had. The UK IIRC, was considering (or did they actually implement it?) some sort of paralell court system based on Sharia Law? So it's not as simple as just saying ""they'll never get it"", it is a very real possibility in some places, and probably rightfully so; after all, the government is there to serve the people, and if a large enough portion of the people want something, they ought to get it. Neo Nazis's race is *definitely* always brought up, in my experience. As for their beliefs it's trickier since they don't really homogenously identify with a religion. But their belief system **is** seen as idiotic and backwards, justly so. But then I'd argue that the exact same thing happens to muslims who advocate for sharia law. I do understand that there's perhaps a slight xenophobic component in the general discourse as well, but that doesn't mean there are not legitimate concerns. 

&gt; Yes, we all want them to Intergrate. But it's easy to be a saint in heaven. And to some people, there is no level of intergration good enough.

But we do have a parallel race/religion group that is immigrating massively and where you don't see this concern popping up: Chinese (and to a lesser extent other asians) people. They tend to not integrate too well either (although arguably better than muslims), but I haven't seen many people complain about them. And that's because their beliefs don't incluse gross breaches of human rights.

&gt; However, imagine that if you had to move to, say, Iraq, would you then start going to a Mosque every sunday(?) and pray 5 times per day, because that is their culure?

That's not the culture, that's the religion. And herein lies the absolute crux of the whole problem: for a vast majority of these people their culture **is** their religion. And artificially so at that (as evidenced by the state of those countries before the islamic revolution). Notice how they're not referred to by their geographical origin or race, as we tend to refer to other groups of people. We call them ""muslims"" the call themselves that as well.

You also bring up a lot of other excellent problems like people not wanting to hire them, etc (but then again, what people from other places do we hire when they didn't immigrate specifically because of their skills?).

The US still has the death penalty and that seems to be broadly backed by religious groups (and opposed by others..).  I think the main issue here though is development not religion.

On the other point, I think the issue here is more that the minority sticks out, most muslims in the UK are as integrated as any other minority group, but they do have a minority that are very visible (somewhat like orthodox Jews I suppose).  I would say that moderate Islam, like moderate Christianity doesn't generally take on the misogynistic elements you describe (and of course some other faiths do again if you take a fervent position).

&gt;The UK IIRC, was considering (or did they actually implement it?) some sort of paralell court system based on Sharia Law? So it's not as simple as just saying ""they'll never get it"", it is a very real possibility in some places

To be fair, this was about arbitration and reducing the burden on the courts, you could use 'sharia' arbitration (met with loud screams of 'Sharia Law!') , but only for some civil matters, more to the point, you could use any other arbitration mechanism that someone provided (again, jewish, christian, secular.. I'm sure someone could set up one based on the ethoses expressed in star trek or the wombles..).

&gt;I do understand that there's perhaps a slight xenophobic component in the general discourse as well, but that doesn't mean there are not legitimate concerns.

I think one of the problems is that the 'legitimate concerns' are overblown, people take a very extreme group (sometimes from abroad) and then apply their behaviour to a much large population, or assume the driver for all groups is the same.  That tends to cause problems.

&gt;That's not the culture, that's the religion. And herein lies the absolute crux of the whole problem: for a vast majority of these people their culture is their religion.

That's true for everyone, it's just the degrees that are different and the cultural practices that are different.  In Europe we take Sundays off, we celebrate easter and Christmas (even as atheists), we probably go to church on occasion for non-religious things (remembrance day, weddings etc...), there are lots of little remnants of a more religious past.  But we have simply converted much of that religious practice to cultural norms.. 

&gt;We call them ""muslims"" the call themselves that as well.

Funny, because it isn't really like that.  We have Indians, Pakistanis (both who used to be seen as that rather than muslims where they are muslims), many Asian groups who are muslim but aren't seen as such, then yemeni's (who moved in the 1920's etc..).  Essentially we are starting to just call them muslims, in the past we used other derogatory terms that were related to ethnicity, now that there seems to be an issue with Islam, it seems we are using that as a collective term instead..

&gt;But this is a COMPLEX issue, and you tossing all discussions about it aside and labelling it as ""racism"" is intellectually disnohest, and ultimately hampers the debate.

I think if someone doesn't want to hire someone on the basis of their ethnicity then that is a discriminatory act, it is racist, there isn't really a lot left to discuss is there? The reasons people use to justify that discrimination may be varied, but if applied to an entire group (A very diverse group) then it really is just discrimination.

It happens. The claims are often exaggerated of course, but it happens. Google and check some sources for yourself.

&gt;Anyway, is praying in the street forbidden? 

Large manifestations on the street are supposed to ask for permits in most cases (if only for traffic reasons). The part that causes the most frowns is that religion in Europe is considered a private affair, to be conducted in private, in particular in France with their notion of *laïcité*. So it's perceived as breaching a social contract.

Fish fridays are just one day, and therefore a matter of normal variety, while every meal is supposed to follow the halal rules. The problem is not the food though, but the fact that religion is gaining influence on daily life, especially the daily life of *other people*.

It's not considered a classic french Grande Ecole like Polytechnique or even the Ponts et Chaussées across the street.

Students mainly enter the transportation and IT services industries so there's a rather good network in these.

The management school (ESIEE Management) is the laughing stock of the school. It's where student doing badly in the engineering school or realizing they made a wrong career choice go. They also take on students trying to specialize into IT management after another business school but its reputation doesn't attract the brighest ones. The end result is a bunch of alumni becoming managers or presales right after school with appalling technical knowledge and too little experience to have any real credibility but still somehow managing to be rather arrogant. The worst part is that it damages the whole of ESIEE reputation since the management school used to have a completely different name.

Another point is that as opposed to ESIEE Engineering, most teachers of ESIEE Management are not actually teachers but only consulting temporarily for their specific course. You might see this as good or bad.

That is all I'm trying to point out.

And when it comes to muslims who have immigrated to western country, personally I believe this burns down to the country they live in. Norway for example, is a country where there are few, to none restrictions on religious countries, and in the years I have lived here, I have seen one or two women wearing niqab. Most muslim women here wear a hijab, which only covers the hair, or no hair covers along with western colthing. Whereas in France niqabs and burqas are more frequent. Although this is just what my theory about the whole matter is.

At the very least I do believe in the countries where this is a bigger issue (as you said, France, for instance) it shouldn't be off-limits, nor necessarily racist (although some of the reasons behind their supporters undoubtedly are) for measures to be taken to cut into these oppresive practises.

eg. Schools have limited their meal selection on occasion, women on the street are less likely to wear open clothing when they have to pass through muslim neighbourhoods, in the UK there are separate courts. So there's definitely some pressure that succeeds in asserting itself.

Those are the extreme temperatures. In average it's much milder. The **average** temperature over the whole winter is something like -2 °C and the **average** temperature over the whole summer is 25 °C. Only on single weeks we get those extreme temperatures.

&gt; So I get that the south is colder than north at all time of the year

No. Temperature swings are much larger. The ocean acts like a buffer and reduces the temperature swing.

I don't think you can blame the disparaty of western and muslim culture. It is entirely possible to be a western muslim. That's not to blame for what happens to some some second generation muslim immigrants.
 What does happen is that their parents can't learn the new language as well due to having to work. This means that their children can easily slack off in and avoid school because their parents won't be made aware of what happens. As a result their school results are lower and they end up in poorer positions and hang out together and then you have politicians whining about how they're all up to no good and scaring old ladies and such.

And odds are very much that children of immigrants instead *distance* themselves from their parents beliefs. Simply because they're outdated, dull and unpopular. They're more likely to hang around with friends from school rather than their parents and if they can be engaged during their school years they'd end up far more westernized instead.

As an outsider who's spent a fair bit of time in Europe, and been to many countries I can say that it's unfair to ask who's the best cuisine.  That's like saying ""what's the best desert"" or ""what's the best drink"".  

The british have the best breakfast I've had in Europe. 

The french sandwiches are great, although a schnitzel on a bun is hard to beat.  Spanish Tapas is great, and their high end is comparable to the best in the world.  The Italians have such a great grasp on simplicity and perfection.  The french have a wonderful grasp of complexity of dishes.  The Belgians have mouilles that are unbeatable.  The greeks with their souvlaki and spanakopita, the Turks with their wraps are wonderful. Borscht and Goulash are great on a cold day, gespacho on a warm day.  

I can't tell you if Nicoise or Paprikash chicken is better, they're both great, but then throw piri piri chicken in there and I'm even more confused.

The point is, there's great food in EVERY country in Europe, some have a few more dishes of note, but it all contributes to a wonderful variety that I, for one, will not give one country a leg up on any other one as it's impossible to completely untie one countries cuisine without the other.

Oil, Venezuela gives Oil to Cuba on the cheap. Greece used to have an account with Iran (before EU banned oil transactions with Iran).   The new Drachma doesn't have to devalued that much to do all this - provided as I said before you don't pay a dime back. There are enough euros in Greece to sustain foreign reserves for a year, until you manage to substitute a number of products with new, local ones, and you create a sensible industry (nothing fancy, just enough to get by). 

Now, for you last part, 

&gt; The alternative is to stop this rambling self-important bollocks about communism and European imperialism and finally start working and paying taxes. This whole ""woe be to the Greeks"" holier-than-thou crap is really getting old.

Well, In a strange sense, I don't know what to say here. The road now chosen by the Greeks is more or less what you are proposing, and this has been established through fair elections, and if there was ever a referendum I am convinced at this point that it would be pro-Euro-no-matter-what. 

So it's clear to me that it's not a ``holier-than-thou'' Imperialism case.  If Greeks think that 6days weeks and 13 hours/day work are worth it, well, let em have it.  I just pity the part of the population that doesn't want to live like that.

The whole thing was based on the idea that everybody would contribute by working, that nobody would be unemployed by their own will.

To imply that these add up to a deep insult, which compounds upon the the holocaust, is offensive not only to the German population, very few of whom were old enough to even fight during the second World War, let alone influence events, but also to her fellow survivors, because of the triviality of the comparison.

Religious rites have to be judged by secular standards, not by the importance to a religious group, or the extent of their antiquity. If someone moves from a tribal area which has practised female genital mutilation for centuries, where this is considered a rite of vital importance to religious identity, she would hopefully not advocate the legality of the practise.

* MPS, 3rd Italian bank by capitalization, is a failing bank, had its rating downgraded by S&amp;P, and had a bailout. Nothing to argue here.
* Italian banks had a drop in share value at the end of July. At the same time the spread between Italian bonds (BTP) and German Bunds was at a record high. Bank stock prices had a moderate but steady recover from then on.

Oh wait, those people do not exist. Dang.

Look, if you're not* just a pedantic little racist (I couldn't decide whether to call you that or racist little pedant - choose whichever is appropriate), then I feel obliged to let you know that the Islamophobia in Europe is as closely associated with race as the hammer is to the sickle. The vast majority of Muslims are not white, and the few white converts are through their notability the exception which prove the rule. It is disingenuous to act as if you are unaware of this. 

Saying that Islam is simply a choice ignores several important constraints on people's behaviour - namely that the families and communities of Muslims bond with religion, or that Muslims might simply be pious. It ignores the fact, that regardless of whether it is a choice or not, Muslims should not have to deal with discrimination, prejudice and oppression in Europe simply because of their beliefs and the colour of their skin.

*Of course, you are in fact just a pedantic little racist, as evidenced by your point saying 'It's not racist to oppose a religion, quite obviously.' When that religion composes 1.5 billion people, of all different beliefs, languages, goals, homelands, desires, tastes and politics, but overwhelmingly non-white, then it is racist to lump them into one category, an Other which can and must be Opposed. Future generations will look back on you and people like you with pity and wonderment - that anyone could be so foolish, bigoted, and incurious to understand will puzzle them much as it puzzles us how whites in the South of the USA could hate blacks so much, or how pre-1945 Germans could hate Jews.",0,1346861515,null,0,false,0,c63tsoe,t3_zcm4u,t1_c63tsoe,t1_c63rgpn,null,1429823585,-23,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-23

So it's clear to me that it's not a ``holier-than-thou'' Imperialism case. If Greeks think that 6days weeks and 13 hours/day work are worth it, well, let em have it. I just pity the part of the population that doesn't want to live like that.

 

&gt; Most importantly however, I feel utter contempt for a civilisation that has deified work.

That's because most Greeks do seem to grasp that hard work is the way out of this crisis for them. That's not the deification of work, that's grasping the notion that *you need to work to earn anything*. That goods and services do not come for free. There seems to be a vocal minority (?) in Greece that keeps harping on and on about the virtues of communism; the failure of capitalism and the evil that are the banks and the rest of Europe. I'm talking about liars like Syriza who keep on going for the populist vote this way. I'm sick of hearing how the Greeks were mistreated, as if there is no blame on Greece at all ffs! The simple fact is that the Greeks voted for nepotists who then gave their voters favors in return, the same people then enriched themselves while they were in office by making shitty deals with banks. It's not the banks that did the evil it was the people the Greeks put into power. If people in Greece stopped voting for corrupt A-holes and started paying taxes things would improve.

Syriza is extremely pro-EU. It's a popular misconception in the rest of Europe that they would quit Euro or anything like that. I am not sure where this misconception got there, but it has to do mostly with inaccurate media reporting. It's more a social-democratic party then a communist party. 

&gt; The simple fact is that the Greeks voted for nepotists who then gave their voters favors in return, 

Most  people vote for purposes way beyond economics. Lot's of people vote e.g. because of religious reasons.

This thread is a perfect example of one thing; most here agreeing that all indoctrination of children with clearly untrue stories is bad. And calling all religions out on this, not forgetting Islam, is what's called for. You can criticize the religion without criticizing the person. Most of us have had some sort of religion hammered into our minds in our childhood and it's a process to get rid of it. The difference between sects of Islam and Christianity is that Islam is younger and it tends to be less on the liberal theology's 'intepreting the texts in a way that recognizes human rights' -side. Now when religion crosses this border, it needs to be immediatelly criticized and opposed. Just like with every other ideology that infringes on our basic rights as human beings; all principally authoritarian ideologies have that same tendency. 

Sometimes religions are more liberal and don't cause clear harm to anyone, that's when it would be infringing on those people's rights to restrain them. Believing in your own religion is completely fine and protected, just as long as your holy commands stop at the rights of other human beings. That's the society we've established

true,[deleted],null,null,"I think you can absolutely blame the cultural differences. The western and the muslim culture have fundamental incompatibilities if you subscribe to traditionalist muslim teachings and values. The fallacy is in thinking that just because all cultures are equal in human value that somehow they're also compatible and equal in a certain geographical location.

It's ridiculous to think that the government can somehow engage the ones who isolate themselves from western society. How is the government supposed to do this? By force, coercion or bribery? The government can't force people to change their cultural identity and it shouldn't be allowed to even try that. Those who open up to the west will end up doing that anyway and those who turn inside towards fanatical religion will do so regardless. Well-intentioned government interference is the last thing we need.

The problem is what are we supposed to do with the minority of second and third generation muslim immigrants who firmly subscribe to these archaic values? What are we supposed to do about the minority of mosques that almost openly preach against western values? What about the suburbs in which natives no longer want to live in because they've turned into low-income housing for an alien culture?

You cannot silence these concerns by wishful thinking and trying to preach humanitarian values. The western media has already done grievous damage by trying to remain silent about these issues. They for example actively cover up crimes committed by the minorities. People talk, people spread rumors and eventually they will get to the truth. This is insane. I'm not against muslim immigration myself. I am just worried sick about the turmoil in Europe that will absolutely follow in the coming decades.

Saturday Sunday and Monday. Starts by a cloths market at Porte de Clign. then the more yo go into it the more it's a real brocante with good and pricey stuff. It's very wide, streets and streets of shops, you have to digg into it. A few jewels are to find like this enormous indian shop with entire bits of house to buy (walls etc, it's kinda crazy).

Code of conduct, Frenchs often say ""Bonjour"" when entering a shop and ""Bonne journée"" upon leaving. Please ask if you want to touch something, in the real brocante shops. It's very rarely refused to you, but it's very rude to do without asking, unless it's that old and rough wood table literally sitting under your hand.

Haggling is more than ok. Remember when haggling is finished, you have the final question ""Now how much if I pay cash?"" Don't bring the cash thing before the end. Never ever hesitate to say ""I would buy it if it was 100€""... even if the tags reads 2000€ or if the lady says so. 

For the soy milk: for availability, choice and quality, target the organic stores (Bio, Diététique) such as Naturalia, Bio-Coop, La Vie Claire. Carrefour Market carries one brand, Auchan A2 carries another.

I'm not going to bother. I don't need to prove that all people who oppose islam aren't racist, all I need to show is that it's possible to oppose islam without having anything against people of other colours, and I present myself as the evidence.

&gt;I feel obliged to let you know that the Islamophobia in Europe is as closely associated with race as the hammer is to the sickle.

You mean movements which tend to be islamophobic tend to be racist? Perhaps that's true. It doesn't alter the validity of opposition to Islam in any way though. You're using an argument of association, which is frankly pretty poor.

&gt;It is disingenuous to act as if you are unaware of this.

Of course I'm aware of the numbers, that doesn't mean that an argument against islam is necessarily an argument against people of a specific colour. It's so utterly ignorant to think such a thing that it concerns me that there are people who do.

&gt;Saying that Islam is simply a choice ignores several important constraints on people's behaviour - namely that the families and communities of Muslims bond with religion, or that Muslims might simply be pious.

The point is that one *has* a choice about religion, you're saying that the choice might be tough and I agree, but that's life. No-one chooses to be born black or male or gay or short or ugly. People do choose to follow a religion.

&gt;regardless of whether it is a choice or not, Muslims should not have to deal with discrimination

Why not? Why should a person's religion be something which I am not allowed to make judgements about, but almost all of their other choices in life are things I can make judgements about?

&gt;Of course, you are in fact just a pedantic little racist, as evidenced by your point saying 'It's not racist to oppose a religion, quite obviously.'

I'm starting to think you might have a case of the stupid. I also oppose christianity, does that mean I'm racist against white people? I also think Zen Buddhism isn't up to much, does that mean I'm racist against Japanese people?

No reasonable mature person would say yes to those things, but to be consistent you would need to.

&gt;When that religion composes 1.5 billion people, of all different beliefs, languages, goals, homelands, desires, tastes and politics, but overwhelmingly non-white, then it is racist to lump them into one category, an Other which can and must be Opposed. 

You're acting as if race is the thing that ties them all together, it's not. Islam is what ties them all together, and so long as people are choosing a religion, I can and will judge them for that.

I'm speaking for myself when I say that it is possible to be opposed to Islam without being racist.

&gt;As I said, lumping them together from an outsiders perspective into one massive demographic in opposition to your own is Orientalist and racist.

To assume all are exactly the same is simplistic and a little stupid, certainly, but this is not what I do. I claim that there is a common belief set which ties these people together (Islam) which I am in opposition to.

&gt;But when appeals were made in spring in the Bundestag for at least some of the nuclear sector to be preserved, the Green Party – the first such case in world history – stood firmly for coal. “We can accept a temporary return to coal as an energy source to protect Germany from the environmentally destructive atom. **After all, we’re all interested in protecting the environment**,” the party’s leader, Jürgen Trittin, explained to the parliament.

No, you do not. You just informed us above that a) we are racists (since you apparently do not know the difference between race and religion) and b) how do you think homosexuals will feel in this subreddit. You said above that you do not want religion to be discussed. Don't you know that many of the religions in Europe treat homosexuals like shit. How do you think homosexuals feels when you think it is wrong to critizse the religions that are spewing so much hatred against them? I am a women - I am happy that someone is pointing out that most religions are misogynist- why do you say that people can't do that? Why can't I critizise someone who treats me like a lesser being? Are you saying I should be quiet and they are right? 


You don't care about my rights, or homosexual rights, only the rights of the religions to continue to be bigotted, hateful and misogynist. It is my right to critizise it and say that anyone who treats women and homosexuals like that is a boil on society. But according to you, I should be quiet - why?

You've read the proposals from a confidential **e-mail**, sent to Greece's Finance and Labour ministries last Friday. By now, every major international news outlet has seen it. They confirmed the story and reported it, as always. What you read above is the English text, as a paste from an e-mail attachment. Capital.gr has the [English and Greek versions of the proposals](http://www.capital.gr/news.asp?id=1603961) in .doc format (right column). It's not a forgery and Troika officials did not deny that they've sent it. In every other case, the EU, the ECB, and the IMF issue press releases denying a story. They didn't now, because they can't lie. I hope this is clear enough.

Edit: after the leaked e-mail, [here's](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19491266) a paper verification from BBC.

&gt; Greece's international lenders have suggested measures including increasing the maximum working week to six days. It is one of several unofficial proposals to liberalise the labour market and increase government revenue, contained in **a paper seen by the BBC**. The proposals were not included in the original bailout agreement signed with the Greek government.

nice to have you :)
do yourself a favor though.. skip munich, at least for this time. it's a beautiful city, but not during Oktoberfest. the fest itself mainly consists of big tents in which it smells bad and where the beer is insanely expensive and not too good. typical tourist trap. also the city will be flowing over with tourists, and not of the nice type because most of them get there to get wasted.

Your time is much better used if you go to Hamburg instead! You can get there from Berlin by train very easy and very fast. (in contrast to Munich).

How long are you going to stay in Berlin though? Because it's one of the greatest cities in the world! Very laid back, extremely liberal.
Rent a bike (definitively the best way to do sightseeing in B) and go see Prenzlauer Berg, then via Friedrichshain to Mitte, through the Tierpark and back via Kreuzberg. in general the eastern part of Berlin is way more charming.
Also make sure go out at least once! Try one of the following: Kater  Holzig, Chalet, Wilde Renate, KitKat Club, Watergate, Berghain (on a sunday between 6 and 9  am is best, otherwise long lines).

If you need a place to stay check www.airbnb.com. Beats couchsurfing imho and there are lots and lots of cheap places in berlin available there. Try to get a room in southern Friedrichshain or sth close to it.

Another issue, is...

&gt;If some subscribers of /r/Europe want to put on their tinfoil hats and play dress up as Le Pen and Wilders, that's fine, but I really do not want /r/Europe to be the place where that happens.

Why do you get to decide that? By what authority can you force upon the moderators this decision, ignoring authority by what reason and logic can you? Even you yourself state you thought /r/Europe ""it was a cool place for Europeans of various member and non-member states to talk and share Europe-wide content with other Europeans"", so if this is the place for current affairs to be debated all sides of the argument can be presented by users. Short of an attack by multiple accounts or an alien community trying to subvert the natural course of what gets upvoted, I see no reasonable/logical grounds for the content you label as ""racist"" or even true racist content to be removed.

Roundabouts. Watch the fuck out. And who in their right mind thinks it is a good place to stop? Apparently half of Italy.

Overtaking. People do not obey the lanes at all and being overtaken at ridiculous places is not uncommon. 

Speed. The speed limits are often quite low for the road but almost everyone goes faster that suggested which often results in a mega line of cars behind you if you follow the rules.

Mobile phones. Every time I go out I lose count of how many people are using mobiles and driving and can usually spot at least one or two middle aged ladies texting whilst driving. It is illegal though so you have been warned.

General rudeness. Everyone seems to be in a rush all the time and thoughtfulness  is a real rarity.

FYI. I'm in Bologna but have been driven to Milan and Florence as well (Autostrada at 150+ kpm was not a fun experience). Depending on the type of driving you are used to I think you may get used to it and all the close calls, shouting and gesturing will be part of the experience. 

I don't want to sound all negative. Going for drive in the Italian countryside can be stunning, breathtakingly beautiful and should be a real highlight.

also i know many people who just loooove the oktoberfest, so maybe it's just your thing. have fun!

frankfurt: DUDE! you can't know that, but frankfurt/main is probably the last city you wanna go. seriously, don't go there. they have a banking district, a few tall buildings, and... well, that's it. oh yeah, there is a big airport. and lots of crime. and an open drug scene. trust me, you don't wanna go there. also (frankfurters may disagree) the city itself is totally ugly as well.
it is surrounded by a very nice area though (river rhine, lots of winegrowing).  Mainz, Wiesbaden and lots of little villages where half the people are winegrowers are close to frankfurt and all very nice and beautiful. and boring.

Berlin: by bike I mean a bicycle. americans..  there are rental bikes scattered over the city (DB bikes). They are very comfy, but a little more expensive. Also you have to create an account via phone before first use, so this can be annoying. But there are lots of shops where you can rent a bike for a few days for like 10€/day.

Berghain is my favourite club, probably one of the best in the world. I named it last though because it's true, for tourist it can be tricky to get in. If you're in it will be a crazy ride though. I proposed 6-9am because otherwise you might have to wait for 2-3 hours. And not getting in then sucks. The standard approach is to go somewhere else before. don't worry, they will close way after you went home :)
getting into the kater holzig might be difficult, too. at least between saturday night and monday morning. at other times you should be fine.

many tourists end up going to Ritter Butzke. do not go there. If everybody else goes there and you can't stop them: go somewhere else alone. you will meet people. RB is huge, expensive and lamelamelame. also arrogant bouncers.

so my suggestions for going out: Chalet (latest hot club, haven't been there yet but I'm told it's good), Wilde Renate, about:blank, Arena Club, Horst Krzbrg, Week-end (haven't been there in ages, but used to be great), maybe Watergate (good, but looooong lines). on sunday morning at least try the Berghain. Definitively try the Kater Holzig whenever you are in the area.

there are only a few tips I could give you to get in: do not show up in groups larger then 3 people. do not be extremely drunk or annoying. do not look frightened that you might not get in. do not wear chic or hip or branded clothes. still, do not disguise yourself, be yourself. look the bouncer in the eyes. he will most definitively ask you something. say something in german. have personality. if you can't decide on shoes wear the oldest chucks you can find. it's easy really.

Now for some reason everyone is okay about bashing Christianity in to the ground for being a terrible fascist this that and the other. This has led Christianity to become a much more moderate religion. I am just sick of being called a ""Racist"" because I wan't Islam to moderate itself.

The only reason Christianity has become moderate was because the establishment loudly condemned its violence, sexism, and the rest of it. The same must be done for Islam, or indeed any other religion that presumes to subjugate elements of our society.

Right, but what did God *mean*? It makes no difference whether or not it's literal, when the old idiot can't express himself clearly, there's room for interpretation.

Besides, your exact words were ""One's amenable to revision, debate and holding at arm's length. The other's pretty non-negotiable."" — That doesn't suggest to me that you were debating whether or not the Koran was the direct word of God, but instead whether or not that word was debatable.

It needn't be uniform. The benefits should be based on the local cost of living. The idea is that they should allow for the same nominal standard (for example: a place to live, food and other basic needs, healthcare). For developed countries, it may mean less then they have now in terms of social security, but it would be anyway better then what they would have in a US-style system. In less developed countries it will wipe out ultra-cheap labor, which is mostly a good thing - at least in Romania, economic growth after 1990 has never been based on large-scale cheap manufacturing.

&gt;Not to mention that for EU wide system to work, it would necessitate either all local state bureaucracies to be as efficient and uncorrupted as the ones in north, or they would need to be shutdown and completely rebuild by bringing state officials from out side the country. It would unforgivable if there would be the same amounts of corruption and black economy in poor and troubled countries as there is now because it would be robbing the rich countries by denying contributions from the poor ones.

Before perceived corruption you might also consider that tax rates are very different, so even legally required contributions vary very much between countries. So how the system is funded also requires rethinking so it is seen as fair by everybody.

&gt;Then there also would need to be complete overhaul of labor market and corporate legislation, in short lots of red tape and costs would need to be cut. For example the reason why Spain, Portugal and Italy have high unemployment is because they have rigid labor markets, people can't be fired when needed.

Maybe, but that's not directly connected to welfare. A welfare system should never be so generous that people prefer to be unemployed to having a job.

&gt;Would people really be willing to change their systems to be copies of northern countries, or lets say Nordic countries? I don't think that people in other countries really understand how much competition and flexibility in there is to allow our economies to work.

My 2c on autostrada driving: people don't use their mirrors. They also weave or straddle lanes (often using their cellphone from my observation). They don't often signal. Therefore keep your eye vigilantly on the assholes in front of you and be VERY alert, watch body language and front wheels for turns (they often give a 'tell' to what they're about to do) and don't worry too much about what's behind you. 

If you're on an autostrada, drive in the middle lane as the merge lanes are often dual-purpose, with a mess of people trying to get onto the autostrada or off it again. Keep well away. When merging yourself, you may find yourself forced to drive on the shoulder for a few dozen yards as people don't tend to move to let you in.

There's a really shitty habit that some people (Mercs and Beamers usually but once even a Smart Car did this) of driving in the fast lane to about 1"" behind your bumper to get you move over. Sometimes they have their left indicator on permanently, and sometimes they use the lights/horn. I used to get shitty with these drivers and not pull over until I realised it doesn't matter. Abandon your ego and just meekly pull over, because otherwise they will endanger you even though it's not your fault.

Finally, someone flashing their headlights sometimes means ""cop ahead"" but mainly ""fuck you"". It doesn't mean ""go ahead/be my guest"" like it does in some other countries. 

If you're in the Tuscan hills, you will get maniacs whizzing past you and overtaking on blind bends. Let them. Keep slow and keep safe.

EDIT: don't worry too much about what's behind you *except for motorcycles*",0,1346922518,null,0,1346947506,0,c64821z,t3_zexdw,t1_c64821z,t3_zexdw,null,1429830497,1,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,1

(For real!)

First of all, most of the waste is recyclable in advanced breeder reactors. The process also significantly reduces the ""glow-period"" from thousands of years to a bit more than a hundred. There are 2000 year old shipwrecks in mediterranenan still intact. Some parts of the ocean bed are pretty much the most stable locations on earth.

But still, radiation is not contagious, we could end up killing off some deep-sea living worms and algae.

A quote from [(a free) book suggesting](http://www.thesciencecouncil.com/prescription-for-the-planet.html) this solution:

&gt; We should probably discuss just how much waste we’re talking about, even though the vastness of the deep ocean bottom is hardly going to be affected. The entire waste output of short-lived fission products from a one-gigawatt IFR plant running for an entire year would be a little smaller than the size of a standard filing cabinet. Say we eventually have 5,000 IFR plants running worldwide once all other generating systems have been taken offline. That would annually produce a block of waste approximately 10 meters on a side, produced from the entire world’s contingent of reactors for an all-electric (and boron) planet. Every few years or so we could put it all in a junk freighter that could be towed out to sea and sunk. The freighter might come to rest on a couple of marine worms. Apologies all around.

However. They do exploit the skills to extreme. Coming from US (I am an active /r/rideit subscriber, so I know a little about US driving customs) you will have to be careful with some things (totally incomplete list of what comes first to mind):

* roads are tighter and the traffic is heavier. which means you will have lots of cars trying to squeeze into some pinhole all the time. expect this and always expect the douches trying to jump into a line of cars passing all the line on a side first. These are actually pushing.

* the traffic signals and signs are mostly a reference not a rule for the most. Don't start moving on green light without looking on side roads that have red. Expect the next Fiat Panda knight or princess to be in the middle of the junction as soon as you move into it. The same is true for the continuous lines, stop signs and all that is not a brick wall. Expect it to be violated.

* distances. There are none. You are not being tailgated, this is just the way it is here.

* turn signals. If you see someone coming into a junction with his blinker on then take an extra caution, most probably he didn't turn it off after using it as an excuse to cut someone.

* speed. it is rather normal for Italians to speed ~20km/h over the limit on large roads. you don't do that because they know where the speed cameras are, you don't. and if you plan to rent a car the rental company will bill your credit card for any tickets they receive. Also remember that no matter how fast you are going in the leftmost lane, soon you will have someone two feet behind.

* two wheels powered vehicles. or motorcycles/scooters/mopeds/etc. Please, expect them, look for them and stay calm. They are filtering, lane splitting, cutting you off and overtake on road shoulders. Italians know and expect that. You'd better too.

Besides the list, as in general, Rome-Tuscany is not as bad as Rome-Napoli but try not to enter the city centers on weekdays if you can. this will save you lots of stress at least.

Traffic will seem to you chaotic at first but it has its patterns and rules though one week is just not enough to understand it :) Just keep your eyes open and all will go smooth as it did with a dozen of my foreign friends from all over the world that drove a car here.

Just like with Christianity, it's so much less urgent to question the teachings of the liberal Christians than it is to question their fundamentalist fringe. Now I completely acknowledge that most muslims in Europe are liberal. The problem is that, there's tons of disillusioned young middle-Eastern youths that are succeptible to extremist teachings in big European cities. Just like their native counterparts are succeptible to radical right and left wing ideologies. This is a failing on the part of the European people and our governments. However, we're used to dealing with radicals in the political spectrum, we have a lot of experience with that. But we're not used to dealing with muslim extremism, it scares us. And that's probably also why it gets much more news coverage than other radicalism. Especially since it is a specific and major problem for Europe to combat xenophobia and make it easier for non-natives to find jobs and become a part of society. 

It's asenine to call all muslims radicals, but it's equally stupid to let go of all criticism of Islam (not muslims, Islam), because of fear of being painted a racist. If we let all criticism be done by the radical political movements, then we face an equally worse society than if we should let real fudamentalist islam spread all over Europe. (However unlikely that in reality might be.) What many need to realize that many middle-eastern folks came to Europe to escape the oppressive climate of their own countries and want to be treated like fellow countrymen instead of suspects. They know best themselves the way Islam has stifled development in their countries and often are the first to distance themselves from that. So instead of letting exaggerated threats run rampant, I hope we could tackle the real issue with radical Islam and embrace the people who have no connection to it.",0,1346924784,null,0,1346925008,0,c6488yw,t3_zcm4u,t1_c6488yw,t1_c6426sj,null,1429830587,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

That seems unlikely to me. We built Proof Of Concept thorium reactors 50 years ago.

I can't see why building one would take 20 years given any kind of concerted effort.  

&gt; Costs money, time, technology, fuel and at the same time we want fusion.

Money and time are costs, of course. Technology isn't a cost, and the engineering challenges we know of have already been solved. And as for fuel, Thorium reactors use..well, thorium, which we are currently just throwing away. There are slag heaps of the stuff in the 'states because no one knows what to do with it. It's a by-product of other forms of mining, typically mining for the rare earth metals used in mobile phones.

These sectoral reductions of energy consumption correspond to overall savings estimated at 390 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) each year or €100 billion per year up to 2020. They would also help reduce CO2 emissions by 780 million tonnes per year.

These potential savings come in addition to an estimated 1.8 % (or 470 Mtoe) reduction in annual consumption which would partly stem from other measures already adopted and normal replacements of material.

What are you talking about?

There have been a lot of attempts at building new plants, but objections from ""environmentalists"" and NIMBYs make it so difficult that sites don't get approved. In addition, the government won't fund development of new forms of nuclear power station because of exactly the above reasons. 

Water cooled uranium reactors were never originally considered to be the end all and be all of nuclear power, it was only step 1 up the nuclear technological ladder. We never even got to step 2.

Unfortunately, finances are now lagging. That's due to two factors. 

Primarily, the growth in finances has been tied to the  consumer price index, which was a reasonable thing to do back when the change was made. Unfortunately, that only includes the cost of sustenance, more or less, as it's made up of an imaginary shopping basket of consumables. Rent is not included in this figure.  

Which brings us to the housing situation, which is the second problem. The financial crisis has led to a stagnation in housing projects getting built, and the few projects going up anywhere in the big cities tend to be large family apartments or overpriced luxury projects, which means that there is a higher demand and lower supply of the sort of affordable apartment that makes people homeowners for the first time (which of course leads to increase in prices), which again leads to more people renting for longer than before, which then again leads to low supply/high demand for rentable apartments, which, yet again based on ECON101, leads to an increase in rent as well.

So due to a heated renter's market, you either remain dependent on family, or you work in order to support yourself in addition to studying.

Most are from mainstream sources, relatively balanced and are about actual issues that do exist, so the articles aren't propaganda by themselves.

Another effect this might have would be to place this subreddit on the racists' subscription list. It doesn't take many of them to give discussions here an entirely different tone.

If you are looking for a room, my advice is you get one either in Benimaclet (true melting pot, at least when I lived there; most buildings are at least 40 years old) or Xúquer (average neighbourhood, a bit closer to the campus, buildings are newer and rents are easily 50% higher than in Benimaclet). Malvarrosa is also quite OK these days and is closer to the beach.

The university provides a search engine to help you find rooms:
http://www.upv.es/perfiles/estudiante/alojamientos-upv-en.html

There are also dorms of course but it's going to be difficult to get a room if you are not going to stay for the full course. Galileo Galilei and Lluís Vives are the closest to the campus.

Apart from Erasmus people, the easiest way to make friends is to go to language exchange meetings at pubs. There's one pub for each day of the week, list (in Spanish) here:
http://www.lasprovincias.es/20100401/comunitatvalenciana/valencia/ruta-ingles-gratis-201004011053.html

There's also a Google Group:
https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/active-english

You definitely want to learn Spanish before you come. It's possible to survive without it but you'll be limited in your experience. The Michel Thomas audio course is a very good one if you don't have a lot of time. Combine it with ""First thousand words in Spanish"" and ""Collins Spanish Grammar"" and you'll get a good base very quickly.

As for the university, it's friendly and you'll have fun. If you need a bank account or an ATM, there are at least 3 in the Agora (the main square, not so far from the Fine Art faculty). Bank accounts are generally free for people under 26 in Spain. There are of course the on-line banks which will give you everything for free.

Here's why:

I would rather my purchases have minimal impact on our environment. E.g Many foodstuffs from abroad must be refrigerated and must travel by ship and road/rail. That wastes a lot of energy IMO and negatively contributes to air quality and peoples health. I'll happily pay a few percent more to avoid that.

I would rather my purchases contribute to the Irish economy. Retention of jobs and taxation is something I try to support. I would prefer if my purchases increased quality of life in my own country rather than somewhere else. I feel a responsibility to contribute to the betterment of my own society, and enabling taxes and jobs to stay here is one way to do that.

I would rather my purchases support fair treatment of workers. If I buy from outside of the EU I don't know what the legislation is regarding working hours, payment, or conditions. I don't want to be culpable (no matter how slightly) to supporting places like sweatshops.

People can argue that this is protectionism but I don't really care. IMO I'm being a responsible consumer.

http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/938

Some Muslim immigrants admit their bias quite openly. An Islamic Mufti in Copenhagen sparked a political outcry after publicly declaring that women who refuse to wear headscarves are ""asking for rape."" Apparently, he's not the only one thinking this way. “It is not as wrong raping a Swedish girl as raping an Arab girl,” says Hamid. “The Swedish girl gets a lot of help afterwards, and she had probably fucked before, anyway. But the Arab girl will get problems with her family. For her, being raped is a source of shame. It is important that she retains her virginity until she marries.” It was no coincidence that it was a Swedish girl that was gang raped in Rissne – this becomes obvious from the discussion with Ali, Hamid, Abdallah and Richard. All four have disparaging views on Swedish girls, and think this attitude is common among young men with immigrant background. “It is far too easy to get a Swedish whore…… girl, I mean;” says Hamid, and laughs over his own choice of words. “Many immigrant boys have Swedish girlfriends when they are teenagers. But when they get married, they get a proper woman from their own culture who has never been with a boy. That’s what I am going to do. I don’t have too much respect for Swedish girls. I guess you can say they get fucked to pieces.

""The Whore Lived Like a German""

In the past four months, six Muslim women living in Berlin have been brutally murdered by family members. Their crime? Trying to break free and live Western lifestyles. Within their communities, the killers are revered as heroes for preserving their family dignity. How can such a horrific and shockingly archaic practice be flourishing in the heart of Europe? The deaths have sparked momentary outrage, but will they change the grim reality for Muslim women?

An Honor Killing in Germany Afghan Girl's Death Sparks National Debate

Ahmad O. stabbed his sister more than 20 times because the 16-year-old girl didn't live her life according to his values. Women's rights advocate Seyran Ates is now calling for German society to intensify its efforts to stop honor killings. ""A girl isn't a whore if she goes out,"" she says.

In Oslo all sexual assaults involving rape in the past year. Have been committed by males of non-western background. This was the conclusion of a police report published today. Where the rapist could be identified, he was a man of foreign origin.

http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jan/30/honour-killings-jury-afghan-family

A jury in Canada has found three members of an Afghan family guilty of drowning three teenage sisters and another woman in what the judge described as ""cold-blooded, shameful murders"" resulting from a ""twisted concept of honour"". The verdicts concludes a case that shocked Canadians.

Prosecutors said the defendants killed the three teenage sisters because they felt they had dishonored the family by defying its strict rules on dress, dating, socializing and using the internet.

Here are things that Muslims do to women that I think are worse than murder.
