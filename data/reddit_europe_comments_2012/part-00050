She had a 30h/week job and the whole ordeal looked like it would kill her. All of the sudden her Chinese boyfriend who she hadn't seen in 3 years comes to visit her (which is very surprising because they don't have money). I had some *abstract* conversations with this guy about life and how they see it. He definitely did not fall in love with Europe and criticized how we drink beer and watch TV all night. Long story short, after a month she told me that family members have been collecting money to get him to Germany so he would get her back to China or the very least impregnate her against her will. Dude's a proper man, loves his girl so he comes to Germany, somehow obtains a Worker Visa and they decide to stay... and the one reason they do this - they can have more than one child in Germany.

 While I have no bone to pick with the studious people who have advised on economic policy and reform in the past few years (although, as a fan of “Black Swan”, I should), one think they have not added (and from seeing some discussion between Keynesians and Austrians, I assume never had to think about) is that it helps if such moves are accompanied by a stated end goal, an overall cohesive vision of the future, some statement to the purpose of all these knob twisting on the great economic engine.

 The lack of this has seen the policies they helped implement attacked by people who, while less informed on both the economic aspects as well as the climate and realities elected officials have to face, do know what people want and assume will get out of all this mess (lower unemployment, higher wages, increasing house prices etc) and can admonish officials for not bringing this about.

 To be honest, considering that similar policies have been implemented on both sides of the channel without any statement about the future but a lot hand waving and blame shifting, I suspect that, either:

  a) they are right and helpful but the truth is hard to swallow

  b) they are wrong, but everyone in their profession and all the books say they are right, reality be damned, the end goal is trivial

Let me put it that way: if you don't have a job in Germany that will keep you busy, it is nearly impossible to create enjoyable alternatives. [..] A non-working mother's life in Germany can turn really boring and mundane ( a student's life can be considered in same way for that matter). That's the biggest issue with Germany. A whole country designed around businesses. It is why the country is deadly efficient but at the same time can not make fullfilling for people who don't have a 8-5 job

OK, but I'm curious - how are these things different in your average US town or suburb? I mean, I can imagine that NYC can be an exciting place no matter how your life is organized, but Peoria, IL., or some other such standard, average US city?

I would have guessed that, if anything, it would be harder still to have a non-exhausting or impoverishing life as a non-working mother in an average-income household in the States, because of all the things that are so much more expensive there: health care and health care insurance, education.. plus, there's (even) less institutionalized ways to combine being an at-home parent for at least some time with keeping a job, because parenthood leaves and the like are much less available.. 

Plus, there's the stuff you read about city planning in the U.S., where the concept of 'walkability' is often absent (no sidewalks in many towns away from the coasts!; fewer cute, walkable downtowns or neighbourhood markets, playgrounds); where small commerce, which in Europe is represented by lots of small shops and cafes and the like, having already been much more replaced with giant malls, Wal-Marts and the like; etc.

But then, obviously, birth rates *are* higher in the States. I would have guessed this was due to cultural differences, the average American still being more religious or cultural conservative or I dunno what ... but you obviously have another insight.

true,Syeknom,CORN,Cornwall,"I moved from the UK to Belgium to study a master's degree. I then decided to stick around to work.

Beurocracy was minimal - I just had to register at my local town hall within three months of arriving.

My degree was taught in English (aimed at international students, particuarly the Chinese).

Whilst studying, I worked as a cleaner for a professional guest house owned by a large engineering company that gave their overseas staff visiting the headquarters in the region somewhere to stay. Good pay for a basic job. English was required for the job due to the international, professional guests.

After I finished my studies, I spent a year doing very little other than cleaning. I was poor as fuck, stayed up all night and slept all day, and was pretty miserable. This was less to do with not being able to find a job, but rather my lack of motivation to apply for them. Nevertheless, I had many fantastic experiences and met plenty of amazing people.

Now I work as an SAP consultant to banks for a banking software company. Great pay, the company is English speaking (though most people are Francophones) and life's pretty cushy for me here. I have a lovely apartment and can finally afford to travel around.

I didn't speak either Dutch or French when I moved here, and after nearly three years can speak some Dutch (I live in Flanders). I have a wide circle of friends (both expats and locals) and a Belgian girlfriend.

Being a native English speaker has been a constant asset, and the Flemish are extremely fluent in English. I've almost never been in a situation where I can't communicate to someone in flanders (Brussels is very different however, the Francophones do not generally speak good English). My somewhat posh British accent lets me get away with murder! :)

It is clear though, that I am the ""good kind of immigrant"" and therefore never really suffered the problems that immigrants from other country face. I'm white, educated, financially sound and speak English. Other immigrants and expats face different problems and difficulties with locals in their new country.

On the whole, living here has been tremendous! Biggest downside is that I no longer feel like I have a ""home"" - I will never feel truly comfortable or at home here, but nor would I if I returned to England.",0,1335788081,null,0,false,0,c4iajzv,t3_synfg,t1_c4iajzv,t3_synfg,null,1435718237,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Nice weather and such but the banks and cartels have a tight grip on this country and almost everything costs more and is taxed more (in regards to medium incomes), than anywhere else in Europe. 

Education is expensive and doesn't guarantee anything these days. Housing and transportation costs are almost pornographic.

Those that have families are the ones with the least ambition or have given up on many things in life. They have no education and live in social housing. Some are foreigners, gypsies or just underachieving/underprivileged. They breed more than the majority because the state benefits them and what get for each kid is enough for their low standards. Specially since most grow up feral kids for being forced to work and have very little in regards to the few privileged ones.

I know the world is in need of contraction but we're definitely not creating a better world for our kids.

Also, this map overlaps with an [immigrant refugee influx](http://media.ft.com/cms/2a937efa-96af-11e0-baca-00144feab49a.gif) almost perfectly, so the fertility is tied closely with immigration.

Depends if you consider existing wealth or generated wealth. A country with a shrinking population ensures a greater share of existing wealth and commons per person. It also means less tax revenue and greater burden per person for the elderly. That works for countries with a pre-existing social fund, and can stimulate (ahem) reproduction by increasing the wealth of the individual to a level they feel comfortable with to support a family.

Traditionally, it is believed that it is education that reduces reproduction rates, but that is minimal compared to lack of resources and increased stress on individuals negatively affecting social reproduction rates.

If, as with most countries, welfare for the elderly and the balance of the government are based on a pyramid scheme predicated on population growth and / or economic growth, then we get a destructive feedback loop once either of these stop being true.

At best we get economic stagnation as with Japan, at worst each country will start to dwindle. At this point, the only answer is to attract more productive bodies into the economy, leading to cultural tensions.

An alternative idea would be to ensure that a small amount of some aphrodisiac is placed into the water supply, while encouraging marketing firms to over-sexualise everything, and kill everyone over the age of 60, reducing the burden on the reproductive generations.

There is only so much efficiency you can squeeze out of a finite system. For example, we have been improving the efficiency of the petrol internal combustion engine for a number of decades now. Ultimately there will come a point where we start drawing near that theoretical maximum efficiency and new improvements would make ever smaller advancements in efficiency. This applies to all systems -  even electronic engineers know that Moores law will come to a halt when we start approachine theoretical limits.

Clearly an exponential growth in energy consumption is out of the question when we're relying on non-renewable resources. Even fissionable nuclear fuel is non-renewable. 

Lets assume that in the future that we're able to move entirely to renewable sources of energy such as solar and wind. Even these will have theoretical limits. The earth only collects a finite amount of energy from the sun in a given unit of time.

En effet !

&gt;En effet, la laïcité et l'athéisme sont très importants pour la nation française, tout autant que nos traditions catholiques.
Les nationalistes ont cependant un intérêt à limiter le développement de l'islamisme et autres sectarismes étrangers.
J'aimerais aussi un retour des anciennes religions (animisme, odinisme) afin de conserver un patrimoine culturel très ancien.

Concernant l'Onanisme, je ne tiens personnellement pas à voir le développement de religions désuettes et sectaires ayant tendance à trop fricotter du côté des suprémacistes blanc. En quoi cela diffère-t-il de l'Islam radical (à part les déités et probablement l'accoutrement), ça je l'ignore. L'animisme me semble peut-être plus en phase avec une société moderne avancée.

&gt;Là encore, pour constituer/maintenir une unité raciale de la France il faut rester pratiques. Par exemple, les nationalistes peuvent se focaliser sur la race blanche et refuser l'immigration de ceux dont la peau reflète peu de lumière.

Justement, tout ceci manque cruellement de sens pratique ... Relis-toi, parce que ça n'a juste aucun sens. Alors comme ça je pourrais me faire expulser ou refuser mon entrée en France parce que j'ai trop bronzé dans les îles où parce que je bosse dans le BTP pendant l'été? Absurde!

Tough yeah, things were bad, that's not as bad as my parents, they were in Africa during the colonial war and my parents were in school a couple of times when fighting broke out, there were guerrilla raids and mortar shelling nearby, so they just stopped going.

Apparently a couple of weeks later after my mother stopped going, the guerrillas stormed her school and the director of the school and his assistant were captured, beheaded and their bodies dragged around in technicals. And my father also has stories like this, once when he was a kid and was in a store with my grandmother, they were attacked and had to hide behind the counter while they patrolled the streets looking for stuff to pillage. Fortunately for both of them, the revolution happened here and they were evacuated by the military, though they came to Portugal leaving everything but their clothes behind and both my grandfathers had to continue there serving.

That always chills me more than their stories of one fish for 8 kids or going through the mountains alone at 4am to get to school.

Oh, if you still believe immigrants out breeding natives in your country, you don't know anything about these issues. Case in point: in Turkey we have kurdish population increasing much faster than turkish population. And it is not like Germany: a couple of million people among 80 million people. More than a quarter of population is kurdish. But only an idiot/racist person would make a big deal out of it. High birth rates are problematic, but it is not those people's fault. It is mostly a sociologic/economic problem that indicates state of Turkey failed when it comes to its kurdish people. Anyone blaming kurds for high birth rates  is an idiot and/or with all likelihood a racist. But here, in this thread, when it comes to high birth rates, many europeans always point immigrants with their blaming fingers.

Just prior to the black death Europe had serious population problems. Afterwards, workers were in demand and land became a LOT more affordable while food was in much higher supply. 

&gt; In Western Europe, the sudden scarcity of cheap labor provided an incentive for landlords to compete for peasants with wages and freedoms, an innovation that, some argue, represents the roots of capitalism. The resulting social upheaval caused  the Renaissance and even Reformation. In many ways the Black Death improved the situation of surviving peasants. In Western Europe, because of the shortage of labor, they were in more demand and had more power. Because of the reduced population, there was more fertile land available. However, the benefits would not be fully realized until 1470, nearly 120 years later, when overall population levels finally began to rise again.

Think of it this way, do you really think we could continue to double the economic contribution that a single person makes every 36 years without increasing our energy demand? The one major change that has lead to the greatest rise in efficiency over the last 20 years is the advent of computing, but this obviously lead to a rise in energy consumption. 

If there is one thing that will drive the rise in economic output over the next 20 years, it will be robotics. This will also require far more energy.

Yes, we will continue to make processes more efficient and this will contribute to economic growth, but as in all things, there are limits to the amount of efficiency that can be obtained before we need to start increasing our energy requirements.

*edit: Example added*

Take your example of the car. Modern engines are only about 25 - 30% efficient. This means they waste 70 - 75% of the chemical energy they consume This is turned into sources such as heat and sound which are useless for propelling the car forward. Efficiency can only be gained by utilising that waste energy, and there is only a finite supply of it.

* Opera: Opera House, Palacio Real (Royal Palace), Catedral de la Almudena (this is an enormous cathedral)
* Plaza de España: essentially the theatre district.  Theatregoers enjoy some great eats around here.
* Nuevos Ministerios: fairly cosmopolitan, but there's not a whole lot for tourists to see/do.
* Príncipe Pío: there's a big mall built around the metro station.

Train stations are at Chamartín, to the north, and Atocha, to the south.  Tickets are cheap.

There's a bus station in Plaza Elíptica; most are headed for Toledo.  Also cheap.

If you're staying around a week and plan to move around a lot, get the 1-week tourist pass.  It'll give you unlimited rides on the metro and buses.  Another option is to buy trips in 10-voucher tickets.  This may be more economical depending on the situation; although you may feel more comfortable purchasing the unlimited voucher, in case you get lost once or twice.

I'd recommend staying two nights near Atocha.  The area is pretty relaxed for being so central.  Overall, there aren't many ""sketchy"" areas in Madrid, i.e. you shouldn't have a problem with crime.

My only theory is that the subtitles are translated first and then the dubbing is done afterwards, but sometimes they have to change the dialogue to match the lip syncing, without going back to revise the subtitle track.

Here are some [demographic statistics from PEW research](http://www.pewforum.org/The-Future-of-the-Global-Muslim-Population.aspx):
    
- In Europe, the Muslim share of the population is expected to grow from 6% of the region’s inhabitants in 2010 to 8% in 2030.
- In 2030, Muslims are projected to make up more than 10% of the total population in 10 European countries (Kosovo (93.5%), Albania (83.2%), Bosnia-Herzegovina (42.7%), Republic of Macedonia (40.3%), Montenegro (21.5%), Bulgaria (15.7%), Russia (14.4%), Georgia (11.5%), France (10.3%) and Belgium (10,2%)).

Looking at the demographics, I don't expect the 8% of muslims (or 10% in France and Belgium) in 2030 to carry any more electoral weight in Western European countries than the 6% does now.

true,khthon,PORT,Portugal. Exit. EU. NOW.,"Capitalism and deregulated markets don't give a damn about families or patriotisms. All it wants is free flow of capital and no legislation to hamper the economics of precariousness. We can extrapolate this from basic primal psychology and even biology! They seek profit and total control! Even if means squeezing any given society. You're just a number to them and when they're done here, they just relocate somewhere else and grind them instead. You know monopolies and cartels dictate things around here. We're just numbers to the shareholders. Think 4Chan's M.O and portfolio.  

Also, kids are expensive. Period. The government spends from 4 to 10 000 euros on average per year (1st grade to college). So every time a kid fails a year the cost increases. This is why the government is being so laxed recently and ordering approvals. We both know it.
Also, it is far from the 11 000 EUROS a single inmate costs each year. Which is why many are still being subsidized (guaranteed minimum income) even long after school (roma gypsies, drug addicts, ex-cons, etc.) as it totals far less then they would cost the state if put through the justice system and sent to prison.

Families are also being driven to pay more and more of school tuition's and opting on private schools, given the number of schools being closed. Books and other costs have doubled and in some cases tripled and books are now non-reusable from year to year. 

In colleges, banks have broken through and are now in the student loan business (the banks business model must keep on growing, right? ... like cancer!). Scholarships and social aid keeps dwindling.
