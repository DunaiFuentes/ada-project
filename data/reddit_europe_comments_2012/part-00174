If you don't want to eat meat/food from bad-treated animals or full of antibiotics, then:
- do not eat at McDonald's and similar ""restaurants""
- do not buy meat from a supermarket

...but visit a local organic farmer and buy directly from him.

But that's only the answer to your question.
I find this thread so stupid, I don't know how to say it. Most of my fellow germans eat too much meat, they all want to pay as little as possible for their food, they give nothing for quality. But at least other countries are even worse.

I count you to the group of people of suddenly get panic about their unhealty nutrition ""because they saw a shocking movie and now everything is horrible"".
If you really think about this and movies like Food Inc. - then think further and start changing with what you eat.
This is what I tell everyone I'm talking with (about this subject).

If you hate how companys like Nestle sell chicken meat that was ""produced"" by a chainsaw, then don't buy from Wiesenhof etc. anymore.
If you are concerned about antibiotics - don't buy meat or fish (also shrimps etc.) from ALDI anymore.
If you are against animal cruelty, don't eat meat anymore or buy from a local farmer.

Oh, and if you started to think about where and what to buy, also think about what is healthy. Nutrition experts recommend meat 2 times a week, 2 times fish. This also means 3 days a week vegetarian food.

And if you then also start thinking about vegetables, not only meat - then you might find out that it's not absolutely neccessary to eat all the fruits and vegetables that exist on this planet at anytime of the year (strawberry's from israel in january?)

Think about what you eat, where it comes from (you will always have a farmer nearby in germany), think critically. Buy better food, it's more expensive, I know.
If all people did this, the quality of food, the treatment of animals, the use of medications etc. would change. In the end they would even start to pay more money for their food. But they don't. (as for example the italians or french guys. I'm so jealous. They have better quality, lower prices for their quality food, etc. You know, last year, there was a report in DER SPIEGEL, they interviewed an italian farmer. He said the tomatoes we get in our tomato paste is what most italians consider as trash)

Oh and btw., you talk about ""BIO"". The term BIO is used in the EU under special restrictions as regulated in an EU regulation from 1992.
Start reading it and realize that -nothing- makes your food better just because it says BIO.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_certification

I recently read a journal about a farmer who has some of his fields directly under the entry lane of a very, very big german airport. Sounds healty? He puts the BIO label on his potatoes, because EU says he's allowed to.


Lol. Will probably see you at McDonalds in 3 days when you forgot this post because it's too stressful.

p.s.
I buy often meat at Edeka because Edeka is organised local, every market has its own boss who decides where to buy. All Edeka's in my city sell meat that comes from a neighboring zip code.
And watch the current REWE ad. I think REWE is very expensive and I hate this kind of ads, but they are right.

It is SNP policy for post independence. If independence happens other parties might have different policies on currency.

&gt;In any case, fine, but you should realise monetary union is going to mean fiscal union, or you won't have any control over your currency. It's what the UK said regarding the Euro and it's unlikely we won't demand it from Scotland. Following it to its logical conclusion as we've seen from Europe, a hypothetical Scotland that just voted for independence would probably find that politically unacceptable.

The Scottish economy and the rUK economy are very similar at the moment and unlikely to diverge quickly.

Westminster is not a competent form of Government any more. If you compare things that fall under the powers of the Scottish Government to the counterparts administered by Westminster in England they are often viewed as being handled better ( (Lack of)Tuition fees, free prescriptions, elderly care). The areas that are reserved solely to Westminster are also fairing fairly badly (Defence- Iraq war, Finance - 3 trillion debt). This cumulated with the lack of any clear path of how devolution could continue, the hostility in Westminster to any real reform (Unelected House of Lords, seats in the Lords that woman are excluded from, FPTP voting system) and the one of the two political parties almost being a nonentity in Scotland but still the UK government is what makes independence worth considering.

In the UK, you don't have that by default because people with international success as a musician mostly sing in English. Therefore, foreign music would be a completely new thing.

And only one of Wales' 4 MEP's are anti-EU. 25%.

England is far more anti-EU compared the devolved states of the UK.

Personally, in an ideal Europe, I'd like a unitary super-state where ""united in diversity"" means just that. Its just a dream though.

I think we're still much too bound to our nationalistic or patriotic ideologies and we prize our supposed sovereignty way more than it's worth.
In the future, as people become more educated we might be able to split ""politics"" into its more basic forms of ""administration"" and ""identity or culture (the, us versus them mentality)"", (not multiculturalism, that's bullshit for idiots; despite its name its nothing but a lack of culture and identity).

If we can do that, then individual countries will be limited to protecting their people, culture, identity, language, traditions etc; a very culturally fragmented Europe where groups of people who don't enjoy those privileges today, do so in the future (Catalonia for example).

While, at the same time, our common administration treats everyone as European citizens and acts for the greater good regardless of ethnicity.

I would believe you if you actually cited polls or a study for this. Otherwise, this would be just joyful self-delusion... thinking that you have an accurate or a rounded perception of a part of reality which is difficult to measure (populations and their behaviors). This is the equivalent of reading tabloids, seeking gossip about people you have no clue about just to cheaply satisfy your curiosity. 

&gt;So I definitely believe that to you, this may be a negative thing.

I really don't care about such speculation. What really bothers me is the the popularization of stereotypes and prejudice, be they negative or positive. If you think that because rroma people from Romania cause drama around Europe, there are negative consequences upon me, you're not just wrong, you're making it worse by supporting the mechanisms by which such stereotypes spread... i.e. making erroneous generalizations.

&gt;So if you feel this goes against inclusiveness and openness, I'm curious how you think the situation in Romania is so much different that you feel it's such a terrible thing.

There is no situation in Romania. What you are thinking about is just a popular story used in mainstream media to get more grab from the audience. The terrible thing is not something regional or local... it's just prejudice, national and ethnic stereotypes; I'm not here as an ambassador...

true,Ozires,FINL,Finland,"I believe we can have a European state, but as you've said we're too far from being one people to ever function as one single super state with one European parliament. More so, I don’t believe we need to abandon our own cultural identities to achieve European unity; European citizenship is carried on the side of our regional identities as something every European can be proud of. 


I believe in recognizing the fact of our European brotherhood and not shrinking away from its implications. In the fields of economy, foreign policy and defence there is only one Europe, for in those areas we have reached a phase in our history where what is good for all of us is what is best for each of us. An economically strong united Europe is the only way for us to respond to the crises facing us in the future, no matter whether they be based on environmental or demographical developments. As single states fighting each other we will only magnify the risks and problems of our part of this continent. The German economy will never be on strong footing if the same cannot be said of the French and the Spanish one. At one point in our future we must recognize this and I would rather it be up to us than to have it passed onwards again to the next generation.

But while Europe is slowly unifying through legal structures, behind the eye of the public, we're pushing the boarders of the federal jurisdiction into state territory and all the while the subsidiarity principle is being gutted. The way this is creeping up on us is making the European people lose faith in a project that was created for their benefit, for peace and prosperity, for freedom and unity; and most importantly for democracy. We can never have true democracy in Europe if all laws are put forth on the European level; Europe is far too vast an area for this to ever function. There is no government by the people if all same laws apply across every member state, their situations are far too different for this to be in each state's best interest. This way the most populous and prosperous states will end up drafting law for all the rest of us and power in this republic will be seized instead of bestowed. 



I believe the way to achieve a unified Europe is honesty about this vision. The people distrust the EU, because there is no democracy. But what will give them democracy, is a Commission and a Council elected by Europe wide elections. A transformation of the federal structure must be championed instead of written in through a backdoor. The people turn against the EU because they fear the loss of sovereignty and the ability to self-govern. But the sovereignty they fear they are losing is in truth already lost. Most Finnish law that goes through our parliament today is based on directives from the EU and all the time the subsidiarity principle shrinks and the power of the EU to harmonize legislation grows. The EU needs federal legislation, but not at the expense of democracy. You cannot grow a federal level of legislation in an uncontrolled and unchecked way by enlarging the European jurisdiction little by little into areas not envisioned in the founding treaties though the jurisprudence of the ECJ. What is required once more is honesty. Tell the European people your vision of the total jurisdiction of the European Union, and put in place checks and balances to control it. Checks and balances that will be honoured instead of thrown aside when it's time for the EU to integrate further. We can never have solidarity if we don’t have respect first. What we need is a European constitution for a European federal state that honours the right to self-government of each member state. A constitution we can trust that limits the EU as much as it limits the individual states. We will never be truly united in diversity until we achieve this. 

Democracy, subsidiarity and a true united federal Europe. That is what I dream of.",0,1354923930,null,0,false,0,c7cyvg8,t3_14e8i1,t1_c7cyvg8,t1_c7cx92e,null,1430609784,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

I have friends all over the world, and I'm always very curious what the dutch are being made fun of, outside of the netherlands. Turns out the germans think we all travel with our tiny mobile homes and we all have one.

&gt; I would believe you if you actually cited polls or a study for this.

I'm just telling you about my person experience. Unfortunately there's no studies made about my life and interactions with my friends. So I'm not really sure what part of this is self-delusion.. 

&gt; If you think that because rroma people from Romania cause drama around Europe, there are negative consequences upon me, you're not just wrong, you're making it worse by supporting the mechanisms by which such stereotypes spread... i.e. making erroneous generalizations.

Actually, you're speculating in this case.. I haven't really heard anything about Romania, be that positive or negative.. The only thing I really know about romania, is that it's relatively poor (not sure if this correct either, maybe it's another stereotype). I hope you don't consider that offensive. If this is the stereotype you're referencing, and why you are upset.. that is definitely something I can understand.

There's a big difference (in my opinion) between for example the following two stereotypes ""polish take all our jobs"" and ""british have bad teeth"". Both stupid stereotypes, but I think only the first is destructive and something we should actively battle. The second is a source of bad jokes that very very little people take as offensive.

If you're hoping for a world where there's no jokes being made that make fun of people (for nationality, or whatever reason), reddit is probably not the best place to start your battle.

British : long history of feud and relationships, then unquestionable alliance since the Crimean war...

Irish/Scots : long history of alliance there, to oppose the Brits.

Germans : Since WW2, our relationship is politically strong, constant and unyielding. Unlike with our British relationship, the Franco-German relationship is hardly one of mocking or denigrating. There's hardly any hate at all.

Italians : cultural and historical links.

At the consulate, I would stress very heavily that you need the visa before January 7th.  They probably won't show any sign of giving a fuck, but if it helps it's worth it.  I don't know how the consulate in Chicago works, but if you have to have it mailed to you like I did, go ahead and spring for an overnight envelope.  

Talk to any advisers you have for your program and see if any of them would be able to talk to the consulate on your behalf if the visa is running late.  

If your first days abroad are going to be just for settling in before the semester and you have to miss them, I wouldn't worry too much.  Have any advisers or friends going keep you up to date on any information shared the first days.  Especially try to find out what the French university will require of you and any deadlines.  If you think you are in danger of missing a deadline, go ahead and try to get in touch with the person/people in charge of foreign enrollment.  

See if you can reschedule your flight if needed.

Going to another country can make it seem like deadline problems are going to have a huge impact on your stay, but you should be alright.

Ridurre i grassi è una cazzata, per il semplice fatto che se non mangi grassi non restano che proteine e carboidrati; di proteine non ne puoi mangiare troppe (io per esempio non più di 100g), quindi il grosso della dieta sarebbero carboidrati, la maggior parte dei quali causa secrezione di insulina (in base all'indice glicemico), ovvero l'ormone che fra le altre cose stimola la conversione di glucosio in massa adiposa e il colesterolo LDL.

Non è altro che la cosiddetta ""dieta equilibrata"" all'americana fissata con il mantra *a calorie is a calorie is a calorie* e su 45–65% carboidrati / 10–35% proteine e 20–35% grassi, che tanti bei risultati ha portato nella lotta all'obesità e patologie connesse.

Yes, and that's the point. You are making generalizations in your mind based on anecdotes and you are also encouraging others to do so. Please tell me you know why this is a bad idea.

&gt;The only thing I really know about romania, is that it's relatively poor (not sure if this correct either, maybe it's another stereotype). 

We have stats for that, you can look it up.

&gt; I hope you don't consider that offensive.

Not at all, and like I said before, I'm not an ambassador; you can't wound my ""national ego"", I don't have one.

&gt;Both stupid stereotypes, but I think only the first is destructive and something we should actively battle. The second is a source of bad jokes that very very little people take as offensive.

I disagree. All stereotypes are a problem, because they contain faulty thinking. By those faults, they can be exploited, whatever the stereotype is.  You think some are negative and some are positive, but that evaluation is relative to how you see the World; essentially, it's just bad information which can be interpreted differently (as in negative instead of positive) by different  people. 

&gt;There's a lot of reasonable threads.. this one was just for fun, which should be ok too from time to time :)

I see it as an addict relapsing into addiction.

&gt;Don't take everything too serious :)

I only take serious what is serious. Stereotypes are deadly serious.

He didn't quite get the English pronunciation correct and instead his accent helped formed what we know today as a British accent. The tour guide gave examples like grass (gr-AH-ss) and glass (gl-AH-ss). Where Americans use the short A sound, Brits use the long AH sound like in German.

I make no claims to the truthfulness of this story. Just passing it along :)

Also interesting, the British royal family had the very German surname of ""von Sachsen-Coburg-Gotha"" until 1917 when they changed it to ""Windsor"" due to the rise in anti-German feelings during World War I. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany%E2%80%93United_Kingdom_relations#Royal_family)

No, it doesn't. If you actually go read the paper they cite it talks about fatty acids, and I understand that some daily mail columnist might miss that, but they don't actually say anything about fats other than referencing total fat intake once or twice.

Oh and by the way, if you're the sort of person who links to blog posts, calling a paper with good methodology and sound work ""bad science"" is just bad form, you probably don't eve know what bad science is!

**Una nuova speranza.** Un giorno, Beppe Grillo aprì un blog. Era intorno al 2005, mi pare: all'epoca Internet cominciava appena a prendere piede in Italia, Facebook e Twitter non erano ancora stati creati e solo pochi fighetti potevano fregiarsi del titolo di blogger. Per questo, il blog di Beppe Grillo, che faceva da complemento e supporto ai suoi spettacoli di successo, divenne il più visitato d'Italia.

#A quei tempi, ciò che diceva Beppe Grillo era ancora interessante, o almeno degno d'attenzione. Aveva preannunciato gli scandali interni a Telecom Italia, divulgava il culto dell'Internet partecipativa (Wikipedia! Flickr! i blog!), raccoglieva fondi per la ricerca sulle nanoparticelle, organizzava il movimento Parlamento Pulito contro i parlamentari condannati in via definitiva. Certo, il più delle volte scivolava nell'impreciso e nell'antiscientifico (sosteneva che palle di plastica e ceramica funzionassero meglio del detersivo), ma almeno gettava idee da discutere.

#**L'impero colpisce ancora.** Poi Grillo, esaurendo gli argomenti da conversazione, cominciò a concentrarsi sulla politica, cavalcando l'onda del disappunto popolare ed esacerbando i suoi toni poco diplomatici. Continuando a parlar male della cosiddetta casta, con gli assist di giornalisti come Santoro, Travaglio, Gomez, Stella e compagnia, divenne presto il portavoce della pancia (vuota) degli italiani, che vuol dar la colpa di tutto alla politica. Tranne, ovviamente, a Di Pietro, con cui andava a braccetto. Grillo ha anche organizzato un paio di comizi ed *happenings*, chiamati V-day (Vaffa-day, si noti l'ammiccamento a *V for Vendetta*). Sfruttando i preesistenti meetup, Grillo comincià ad appoggiare alcune liste civiche.

**Il ritorno dello jedi.** Qualche anno fa ha fatto il gran salto e ha fondato un partito che non vuol chiamarsi partito, bensì movimento. Si chiama ""MoVimento 5 Stelle"" (si noti ancora la vu maiuscola) e dovrebbe raccogliere in una congerie decentralizzata persone comuni per rappresentare la gente comune in parlamento e a livello amministrativo. Stiamo parlando di un partito che, allo stato attuale, sarebbe votato da un elettore su cinque.

La maggior critica rivolta da mezza Italia al movimento è la struttura interna. Quanto potere ha Grillo? Quanto potere ha Casaleggio, ovvero l'eminenza grigia la cui azienda manovra tutto l'impero Grillo, dal blog agli spettacoli? E quanto potere hanno i candidati del movimento? Se Beppe Grillo dice ai suoi di non andare ai talk show, loro devono ubbidire? Se non lo fanno, che diritto ha Beppe Grillo di disconoscerli e scacciarli? E ancora: è giusto che gli esponenti del partito si rifiutino di parlare ai giornalisti?

#Proprio l'altro giorno il M5S ha indetto le primarie del partito per eleggere i candidati al parlamento (chiamate ""parlamentarie"" perché sì), condotte via Internet e aperte solo agli iscritti al movimento stesso. I voti sono stati pochi (95mila) e già qualcuno lamenta di essere stato escluso, benché formalmente eleggibile.

Yes, the politics of a Brexit might damage Anglo-French defence cooperation, but that would be a political choice that could be exercised for any number of political disputes, but it is in no way predicated on EU membership itself.",0,1354973414,null,0,false,0,c7d6x7s,t3_14ee0y,t1_c7d6x7s,t3_14ee0y,null,1430613795,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,Kit_Emmuorto,vaticano,,"Non so da quanto tempo sei all'estero quindi, nel dubbio, parto da lontano.

A partire da una quindicina di anni fa, Grillo inizia ad innestare nei propri spettacoli elementi di denuncia e controinformazione su argomenti politici, economici, ambientali e così via. La cosa fa presa, e Grillo inizia a trasformarsi da comico puro ad educatore. La gente che prima andava a vederlo per farsi gli sghignazzi comincia ad andare a vederlo per farsi spiegare come va il mondo. E il mondo, ovviamente, va di merda: il potere fa delle porcherie bestiali per alzarci due soldi in più e noialtri immiseriamo. Immediato successo: primo perché obiettivamente le porcherie ascrivibili al potere abbondano, e poi perché va a toccare una delle corde più profonde dell'animo umano: il bisogno di trovare qualcuno da incolpare per le proprie miserie. E Grillo è bravissimo a mettere insieme questo mostro di Frankenstein padronale con pezzi di politici, banchieri, industriali, finanzieri tutti cattivissimi e tutti vistosamente responsabili di stare mandando le cose a puttane.

Considera anche che il fattore tempo è decisivo: Grillo ottiene il riconoscimento politico nella seconda metà degli anni Zero. I quali coincidono con la comparsa dell'unico, riconoscibile movimento di opinione visto di recente: l'anti-casta. Nel momento in cui i partiti nuovi e diversi sbucati fuori durante la precedente fase di repulisti (cioè Berlusconi e la Lega) falliscono, la domanda ciclica di rinnovamento torna a farsi feroce. E dell'offerta per questa domanda Grillo è monopolista.

I problemi iniziano adesso. Perché per iniziare a far eleggere la gente devi farti un minimo di struttura. E lì l'inesperienza la paghi. Mano a mano che gli eletti negli enti locali aumentavano, i limiti di una struttura messa su presto e male sono venuti fuori. Oggi il partito di Grillo è, oggettivamente, un casino. L'idea della setta col Grande Vecchio Casaleggio nella stanza dei bottoni che inizia ad essere diffusa, il fatto che ultimamente quando si parla di Grillo è perché c'è qualcuno che sfancula qualcun altro e che fai, mi cacci, la pagliacciata delle primarie farlocche dove votano trentamila persone e viene fuori che si candida la sorella di un trombato siciliano. Più la transizione da internet al mondo reale va avanti, più la credibilità di Grillo ha problemi. Da quando ci sono state le primarie del Pd i sondaggi hanno iniziato a girare male, e da una settimana è stabile sotto il 20% (che è sempre tantissima roba, per carità).

Resta il fatto che stiamo parlando di un partito che farà cento parlamentari. E di un partito che, al di là di tutto, ha il merito di attrarre un mucchio di gente con la genuina aspirazione a fare del bene. Molto dipenderà da come si comporteranno in Parlamento. Il fatto che si tratti di persone di nessuna esperienza politica, comunque, non fa sperare troppo.",0,1354973787,null,0,false,0,c7d6yit,t3_14htfp,t1_c7d6yit,t3_14htfp,null,1430613803,35,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,35

Not really. Irish Home Rule nearly destroyed the Liberal Party and helped destroy the reputation of Gladstone. It was not at all a popular policy and is one of the reasons the Conservatives were in power from 1886-1905. The governments of Gladstone himself after 1866 were propped up by the Irish Parliamentarians and wouldn't have seen power without them due to the Home Rule bills.

It's a perfect example of the anachronistic policies of the Liberal Party, it was not a vote winner and not popular among the largely unionist general public. It's not particularly accurate to say that the majority of people were in favour of Home Rule - at the most you could say they'd rather Home Rule than independence.",0,1354974508,null,0,false,0,c7d718h,t3_14fpb1,t1_c7d718h,t1_c7cnlrb,null,1430613838,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,Ozires,FINL,Finland,"That is a false equivalency you have there. Being part of a federal union means to the contrary not losing all sovereignty, but having two limited spheres of government both restricted to the areas best suited for them. 

In trade, foreign policy and defence there is one Europe. It either votes together or it once more falls apart to its internal squabbles benefiting neither itself nor the world outside it. But what needs to be recognized is that 500 million people on this side of the continent can never be ruled by one single law. We can never have one single taxation plan, one single welfare system, one single criminal law. And we should not either. In a European federal republic, that respects the true principle of subsidiarity and self-government these things are restricted away from the federal structure for the parliament of each state to decide according to the wishes of its people. This is the only way 10 million Swedes can live together in a republic with their 82 million German brothers. 

Now the European Union right now is expanding without any clear direction or cohesion. It is not moving towards a federal state it's moving towards one republic with one parliament for 500 million people, whose decrees merely get rubber stamped by the national parliaments. Why is this? Because Europeans either lack the courage to speak out for the true meaning of a federal republic, or don't really understand it.

With this current integration we are dangerously moving towards a European state which can never guarantee self-government and democracy for European citizens. What we need is a federal constitution clearly defining the powers for the federal union and the individual states. A constitution that restricts both the European Union and the member states. Honesty is what is called for! We can't ask the citizens of Europe to trust the European Union if they're never told clearly what this project is aiming for. It's not a question of why so many of them are against it, it's a question of why so many still support it. And they do support it, because they recognize the benefit for all of a united Europe. What they need is an assurance of subsidiarity and democracy that isn't just empty words to be cast aside in the next EU summit. An assurance to be argued to them instead of negotiated in shadows by bureaucrats behind locked doors. 

Honesty and respect for the European people is the only way to save the legitimacy of this Union that was first envisioned with their best interest in mind.

Chances are that in America you will find the old, pre-1990, richer, greasier, heavier, kinda Portuguese-style Hungarian food, goulash, and stuff like that. Very much similar to a Portuguese or Brazilian feijoada, except red with chili powder. This is also OK, if you don't count calories and if  they do it the old way. Generally a meaty taste should dominate with some hints of chili and onion. So if and when for example it tastes a lot like tomatoes or lots of vegetables, it is not authentic. Note that goulash is also a popular food in Germany/Austria but made very differently, basically only the name is the same. 

Should I give you a basic recipe to try at home? Can you find a really dark, dry-blood-red, but not hot, (as it takes a lot), chili/paprika powder in some Mexican shop? This is the only crucial ingredient, otherwise it is about as easy as chili con carne.

&gt;I have a hard time caring about Direct objects, Indirect Objects, and don't ever think about subject verb agreement. I'm all about context clues.

In English, context, particularly word order, tells us the role of the word in a sentence, at least if we don't have a preposition. In other languages, such as German, word order is more variable and there are a variety of other markers that tell us how words in a sentence relate to one another. Knowing how to employ these signals is part of being proficient in a language and is especially crucial for non-native speakers, who want to minimize the chance that they will be misunderstood.

It has nothing to do with intellect. It also isn't the case that German is all that hard, or that native speakers fudge grammar, at least to a comparable extent, but this is something that many like minded language learners do, thinking they can cheat the tricky parts of learning a language by smoothing over the grammar. From my experience, this never ends in anything approximating a native speaker's command of the language. The test probably accurately assessed your level of German. But so what? Doesn't mean you're stupid. It just means you haphazardly learned the language the first time around.

For comparison, the Democratic Party, the main left wing party, would get 31% of the votes – and 39% if you add its allies.

Milošević came to power when he promised Serbs no one will beat them in their ""heartland"" of Kosovo and it will always be Serbian. He used Serbian nationalism and Kosovo Serbs to take over governments in Vojvodina, Montenegro and Kosovo giving him 4 votes in Jugoslav leadership (out of 8).

The so called ""Yoghurt revolution"" was using Serb nationalism to achieve its goals and as they started to succeed other nationalis, like Croatia, started to flare up.

By the time of first elections and fall of Berlin wall, Slovenia and Croatia wanted to get the fuck out of Yugoslavia, while Serbia was trying to create ""greater Serbia"" which would include basically whole Yugoslavia except Slovenia and small portions of Croatia .....

- TK Whitaker: An economist who worked closely with Lemass in setting out the groundwork for our political and economic development.

- ~~Eamon De Valera: A main player in the Irish war of independence and later Taoiseach and President. Personally I think Dev's influence on Irish society in the latter stages of his political career was largely negative, but the role he played in achieving Irish independence is undeniable.~~

- ~~Michael Collins: Another guy who fought for Irish independence from Britain.~~

- James Connolly: Yet another freedom fighter, but also a staunch socialist and one of the founders of the labour movement in Ireland.

- Constance Markievicz: Another revolutionary and socialist, but also a suffragette, and a good representative I think of the role women have played in Irish history.

- WB Yeats/James Joyce/Samuel Beckett: To represent the Irish literary tradition. There are plenty more names that could be used to represent this tradition but I think these are the most famous.

EDIT: In light of people's responses, maybe it would be best to remove Dev and Collins and in their place add:

You will likely want to arrive sometime in Sept (apartment hunting and all that), you'll start working Oct 1st, and you will not get your first payment until November (you get paid the month after always).  And that's if you're lucky enough to not run into any problems with late payments, for the unluckier ones it's easily several months until they see any money.

Also apartments require a deposit frequently, so account for that too.  And it's a good idea to have some money to account for shit just happening.  Do **not** start the program with less than 1500 EUR, and that's an absolute minimum.

Back to the passport thing, you can pick whatever date you need on the visa application (at least I was able to, I picked something in early/mid Sept).  If you get your shit together early in the summer and apply for the visa far enough in advance, I don't think there's any reason you can't go however many weeks before the start of the program to do the camino or travel elsewhere.

It sounds like if you are about to be granted your J.D., you have two B.A.s, and German was just a minor, then you aren't spending as much time practicing German as you're spending on other things. It's pretty normal to be extremely rusty after going a long time without practice, especially if it's a language that you were never ""fluent"" in to begin with (and by ""fluent"" I mean near-native level).

I practice my German quite often, but lately I've been busier with other things and it shows. I'm not as quick to formulate responses in German as I was a few months ago, and I'm a slower translator than I was a few months ago. But with practice, I'll get back to where I was and then keep improving.

I have heard native speakers fudge grammar before... but not to the degree you're describing. They could very well be idiots, or they could be brilliant. The reason they don't screw up grammar is because it makes sense implicitly to them. A German screwing up dative with accusative would be like you trying to say ""I talk to them"" and accidentally saying ""I talk them"". It just wouldn't happen, no matter how little English you've been speaking lately. Your native grammar is so fundamental to your expressive capabilities that mistakes like that would be extremely uncommon.

So, no. You are not an idiot. You just need to realize that remaining competent in foreign languages requires a lot of regular maintenance, no matter how smart one is.

I did this for two years (2006-08) and had a blast.  With the 12-hour schedule, a lot of schools will work with you to give you a nice 3-4 day work week, which gives you a lot of time to travel.  My school also asked me to do an after-school tutoring program for extra money, and I also had under-the-table private English lessons with other teachers and students.

(Some folks didn't bother to finish the process and never got their tarjetas, but that would usually bite them in the ass if they ever wanted to leave the Schengen area and return -- they were always worried that immigration wouldn't let them back in, which was definitely a possibility since they'd technically overstayed their visas.)",0,1355011435,null,0,false,0,c7dezd3,t3_14iboa,t1_c7dezd3,t3_14iboa,null,1430617747,4,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,4

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

&gt; It took Ruffo a month to amass a force of 17,000;mostly peasants, but also ""bandits, ecclesiastics, mercenaries, looters, devotees, and assassins.""

&gt; By the end of April, the Sanfedisti had subdued the entirety of Calabria and most of Puglia, and began a land siege of Naples in June.[5]


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&gt; Similar to other anti-French uprisings in Italy, the Sanfedisti carried out pogroms of Jews, who were perceived as supporters of the Enlightenment ideology.[9] Furthermore, Bishop Giovanni Andrea Serrao, the Jansenist leader in southern Italy and a supporter of the Parthenopaean Republic, was summarily executed on February 24, 1799 by the soldiers of the Potenza guard, as Ruffo's forces were drawing near to the city.[10]

As a dispassionate observer, I think you're right. After all, when was Romania anything else but a backwater? Backward countries tend to persist in their  backwardness, the reverse is rather the exception and not the rule. I mean what do countries like Romania and Bulgaria have going for them? Not much I would say. To develop you need resources and/or human capital and the only resource Romania seems to possess in vast amounts is its massive hordes of hyper-religious illiterate peasants. Of course the fact the average Romanian IQ is  well below European standards doesn't help either.

&gt; And this 3% higher than Germany growth is unfeasible: if anything, 1the gap is growing.

Again, I agree. As sad as this may be  although the vast majority of Eastern European will  converge to European standards that's probably not the case of Romania and perhaps even Bulgaria, it grows way slower than its more Western neighbours and in all likeliwood the gap will continue to increase. When we're taking about Romania and Bulgaria I think it's fairer to compare them to Middle Eastern countries like Turkey and Iran than European ones.

Blue parties are Berlusconi (PDL) and allies. The green bar should probably added to them as well (Lega): they are the crazy xenophobic separatists that were Berlusconi's allies until Monti took over. 

The red parties are the left wing parties. They will likely form a single coalition.

The M5S (yellow) is the 'Fuck them all' party, in a nutshell. It's a 'non-party' started by a comedian whose goal is to demolish the current political class. They have picked their candidates with internet polls out of a list of thousands with a mandatory lack of political experience. They already managed to win some local elections, then immediately started fights with their elected people for being too much like the 'system'. What they will do is entirely a guess, as it basically depends on who the internet polls have picked.

So, currently Berlusconi seems to have little chance of winning, but he has alredy started the whitewashing campaign: his 3 TV channels plus 2 of the politically controlled state channels have started beating the drums for him with the expected ""It's all Monti's fault"" and ""we'll lower the taxes!!!1!!!"" stuff.
