Are you sure the reason we are falling behind is that we are divided?

Because it seems to me, that the more probable reason is lack of competiveness of many of the EU countries. Higher labour costs, more welfare state, less hard-working population, etc, etc.

It's hard to compete with China, when you're being paid for the same job 5 times as much, and you have safety net. They don't, so they work harder for less money.

Unification would mean the few EU countries that try to compete on price (mostly central and eastern europe) won't be able to.

Fast forward to the collapse of the USSR and the opening of borders. Due to the fall of communist style planned economies, many seek to escape financial hardship though emigration. This led to another wave of migration from Transylvania and some CIS states (especially Siberia and Kazakhstan)

I cannot really say anything about the refusal to integrate, because oftentimes there was no real concept of nation state before the collapse of the big empires in WW1. Many groups mixed and lived side by side, but the Germans were usually favored by the elites (Russian or Austro-Hungarians) so their culture became the more prestigious one and it was more usual that people would integrate into the German culture than the other way around (although it also happened, especially in Poland).

OP asked about *Americans calling themselves German because of their ancestors*. He is speaking of American *citizens* who consider their *cultural background* to be German. 

On should keep in mind that there are several meanings of nation, nationality and citizenship. You are right that it is useless to debate technical citizenship (having a specific passport), but discussing cultural background (which can also be called nationality!) is never useless.

true,StupidQuestionsRedux,null,null,"&gt; So? Part of the communist ideology, at least as interpreted by Stalinism and Maosim alike, is the abolishing of all religion. 

My point is that the goal was the supplant a belief system with another one, they weren't actually trying to create a society of free-thinking independently-minded people. Communists just didn't like what they perceived as competition and wanted total domination of the ideological space; in order to achieve that they had to annihilate any alternative power structure.

&gt; Communism has no beliefs in any supernatural or divine power.  

Do you need a belief in supernatural to qualify as a religion? I heard some versions of Buddhism are completely naturalistic too. In any case, there were some religion-like features in both theory and practice. First of all, Communists have lots and lots of faith and a form of Messianic vocation, haven't you heard how Communism is inevitable and it will triumph against the forces of ~~Evil~~ Capitalism and then we will all live in a socialist paradise without exploitation and alienation? Like in that song, heaven will be a place on Earth. There is also a form of ritual and plenty of worship for the providential leader and the prophets, funnily enough for an ideology which subscribe to historical materialism.  Also because Communism is obviously correct those who reject it must be  in some way ""blind"" or in the case of the Soviet Union [mentally ill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sluggishly_progressing_schizophrenia).

&gt; It believes in reason as interpreted from its own paradigm.   
  
I'm sure Catholic thought makes a lot of sense too once you start buying into its original tenets.

&gt; The Soviet Union and China both spend a lot of resources on scientific advancement and education of the populace    

That wasn't science for science sake, science was just a tool employed to highlight the resplendent nature of Communism, any kind of human endeavor was subordinated to the all-engulfing Communism.

&gt; mistaken but nonetheless perceived to be scientifically based agricultural practices, for example  

If that was a reference to Lysenkoism, it just shows how easy was to depart from sound scientific reasoning when in conflict with the official dogma. Just like the Creationists, Communists and some leftist thinkers in general really have a hard time coming to terms with evolution theory and genetics. They're all for it in abstract when it can be used to invalidate some central doctrines of traditional religions but  when applied to humans to study differences between populations or even more inflammatory the inheritability of cognitive abilities things start to change, they want more nurture and less nature; if only humans could be these tabulae rasae.

&gt; Sure, there is an element of leader worship and most certainly a very strong concept of religion-like dogma in regards to ideological thought. But is that enough to qualify it as a religion?

Some may say that [yes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_religion). If I'm not mistaken, Christopher Hitchens  and Sam Harris are proponents of this view

&gt; Does that not make most if not all political ideologies or parties ""religions"" 

Most political ideologies lack the aforementioned unshatterable faith and utopianism neither do display the same degree of rigid dogmatism.

&gt; Surely if you were to join almost any mainstream European political party no matter what end of the spectrum and then start questioning their ideas you'd be kicked out at the spot for being in violation of party ""dogma""?

I don't see nothing wrong with that. Why would someone join a party in the first place if he/she doesn't agree with its basic tenets? What's the point in that?   
  
&gt; Sometimes communists blur the lines, but ultimately it's an ideology first and foremost.

These things aren't mutually exclusive. 

&gt; you aware that Islam prescribes mandatory charity, in concept not all that different from sharing the wealth?   
  
Yes. And before Islam there was [Mazdakism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazdak) even more clearly proto-socialist.

&gt; Did you know about these couple of ideologies, all based on merging left-wing political thought with religious fundamentalism?  
 
Yes, there are even some [Christian Communists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_communism) but they're a fringe group.  There will never be a lack of schismatics.

&gt; How would that even work, if communism is its own religion (and thus implicitly non-compatibility with other religions)?

Religious syncretism? /joking  

&gt; But in any case, why does it matter if they were atheist (or their regimes were, if not they themselves)?

Who said it does matter if they were atheist ? On the other hand, I'm not exactly sure what an ""atheistic regime"" is. As I previously mentioned atheism wasn't mandated for atheism sake. I think ignoring this fact is dishonest and muddies the waters.

&gt;  Atheism is not a religion. It makes no demands of its adherents to act or believe in any particular way or thing.  

I can't dispute that.  

&gt; Isn't that partly the point?
 

What point?

&gt; I don't see why you couldn't be both a genocidal dictator and an atheist, when atheist itself (as opposed to secular humanism or just plain old cultural doxa) doesn't prohibit you from cold-hearted oppression and mass killings. 

You could very well be.

&gt; Atheism is a grouping of a huge number of diverse beliefs and people, not all of them are pleasant. The only thing they have in common is that they do not follow any particular religion or hold beliefs about anything supernatural.

Indeed.

&gt; This can't be news to you.

Is not. To summarize, the views exposed in this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EX1LECWEzs) are closely aligned with my own.

&gt; Marxism and Maosim both had atheism-based ideas, but it doesn't mean anything because atheism is not itself an ideology or religion

How can you have ""atheism-based ideas"" when atheism doesn't hold any kind of positive beliefs? You said it yourself, atheism is not an ideology in itself and means nothing more than a lack of belief in the existence of God.

This is a weak comparison. Playing cards and knitting is something they've done since they were kids, and they're so accustomed to it that it comes natural to them.

In Poland when you have a child, you get on time donation of 250 Euro, and that's it. In welfare states like France or UK you get more monthly. That's one reason for why labour costs in Poland are cheaper. That would change, if there was unification.

Similiar things with unemployement pensions - in Poland IIRC it's around 200 Euro monthly, for the first half a year, and nothing after that. How much is it in Germany? For how long?

Lets be honest there faith has been under attack. The media has calmed down as the war in muslim countries is winding down. Funny that.""

Yeah, I guess they are outnumbered but not that vastly as one might think. Christianity was also under attack, but you dont see christian al-qaeda. I think the very reason they are reacting in this manner is the reason why Islam is dangerous. 

""The idea that somehow we will all be forced to live under shariah law is so utterly ridiculous its laughable. It will never happen. Ever.""

I always enjoy it when people say something like this. Hey, lets wait a decade or two and well see, right? :)

Well, they havent seen it with their eyes. I dont think thats much of an argument really. Fear is one of the reasons why they might turn to radicalism. And Im sure there are plenty of normal muslims, thats not the case.

I'll insult Ukraine *any fucking day that it deserves it*.

However I've looked up the story and seen it written about elsewhere so fair enough. I think this is a case of some complete nutters trying (and failing) to whip up support for their own hostile interpretation of Islam.

They have by no means succeeded in setting up a Sharia ruled area of London and have no way of enforcing the claims on their leaflets. I can almost guarantee you wouldn't find any there now.

Government is needed so that assholes who want to ruin it for everyone else can't succeed, just like you're not free to steal from someone (regardless of wherever you are), you should not be free to smoke onto him and give him lung cancer (again, regardless of your location).

Libertarianism includes anarco-capitalism so I am supporting libertarianism either way, but I'm not being anarchic in any way shape or form. Voluntary contracts are the basis of libertarianism and what you have here is a owner setting up a smoke allowed bar and a client making the choice of going in. It is voluntary, nobody forced the client to enter the bar, he choose to do so himself. I don't see what's wrong with this, don't you trust people to decide things for themselves?

&gt;Guilty as charged.

You're an american liberal! :O

&gt;Sorry, I get your position but I just don't agree with it, it's too extremist, some degree of government is required, I don't agree with free handouts but I also don't agree with not saving someone's life because of their financial situation.

The market would save their lives, hospitals would get terrible reputation for letting poor people die and the ones that choose to help will get more support from the community. It's not that I want people to die, it's just that I believe the private sector can provide better and cheaper healthcare =)

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;Punching a guy in the face is not voluntary, if I have a sign at the entrance of my bar saying smoke allowed then you know what you're getting into.

Smoking is already allowed at bars. It's called outside. You know what you're getting into if you stand outside with the smokers. Inside it's reserved for those who don't want any of it and to prevent those who work there to get exposed to the toxic fumes and other health and safety related concerns.

If you really want to smoke, fine, of course you're free to do such, just do it outside where the smoke doesn't hang around and is harmful to third parties, being them other costumers or the workforce.

&gt;what you have here is a owner setting up a smoke allowed bar and a client making the choice of going in. It is voluntary, nobody forced the client to enter the bar, he choose to do so himself.

Don't think only about the client, think also about the work force and about third parties that might have to spend some time there and not want any of the smoke. Be them the guy behind the counter, the cops sent there to keep an eye on things or the 5 year old who's missing school, there's plenty of people that might deal with 2nd hand smoke and not want it.

Besides, you can't ban non-smokers from getting in, that discrimination, just like [this](http://i.imgur.com/UDlB3.jpg), and that's unlawful. Instead of only letting those who smoke or those who don't, make it possible for everyone, and those who do want to smoke, fine, outdoors is fine, smoke there and don't give lung cancer to the rest of us.

&gt;I don't see what's wrong with this, don't you trust people to decide things for themselves?

I do trust them, otherwise I'd say all smoking should be banned lol. What I don't trust people is to not be dicks to one another, and smoking on top of others is not only dickish, it's unhealthy. It's why the government must create some boundaries, and that's what this is, you want to smoke, fine, do it away from those who don't want it.

&gt;The market would save their lives, hospitals would get terrible reputation for letting poor people die and the ones that choose to help will get more support from the community. It's not that I want people to die, it's just that I believe the private sector can provide better and cheaper healthcare =)

True that, but even you are assuming that people would have to die. I'm not saying the government should pay for everybody's sicknesses, I'm just saying if they can't afford it and it's a critical situation, the government should step up and pays for all medical expenses and then that person is free to go. They'll later pay back their debts to society like we all do, through taxes. Sure, some people might pay for it and never benefit and some might require healthcare and never be able to afford it but that's a minimal price to pay to ensure people don't die when we have the technology and the resources to keep them alive.",0,1344262234,null,0,false,0,c5oydfs,t3_xpmc6,t1_c5oydfs,t1_c5oy63p,null,1429565995,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

The issue is NOT TO ACT in a racist manner.
Chinese do not like blacks, Latinos do not like whites, whites do not like themselves, fundamentalist Muslims despise everyone who is not Muslim, Indian castes are based on skin tone (the lighter, the better).
Even in China, if your skin is darker, as a Chinese, they call you ""black"".
Black female artists bleach their skin, wear blue contacts, want Caucasian hair and look.
Bollywood imports white women to play as Indian women.
In Europe (Eastern part), if your skin is darker, they also call you ""black"" and treat you as if you were a lower class.
Skin bleaching is rampant in Jamaica.
Why?
Because status is given by a lighter skin. So they take huge risks to achieve that.
Because they are subject to racism. 
Racism does not occur only between races, but within the same ethnic group/race as well.

Heck, I already told you why, healthcare concerns regarding everyone, if you want to smoke, fine, outside, not indoors. Healthcare concerns trump over the right to smoke next to others. Again, if you really want to smoke, do it in a place with no roof or wear a nicotine patch or something, just don't give others a hard time breathing because of your habits.

Damn, I'm not against smoking, I'm against smoking next to others indoors. Bars and restaurants are public places and as such should be available to all, smokers can still smoke there provided that they're not spreading around their smoke to those who don't want it and considering this is a healthcare issue, no, you can't just say ""cancer-allowed place"".

2 - After number one is created, the different governments cannot issue debt. That means the end of national bonds.

3 - The only one who can issue debt is ECB or the already mentioned organism (see point 1).

4- Eurobonds.

In this order. 

It is not a fast or easy solution but in my opinion a definite one. 


There is another dirtier one which can buy us time which is to make the ECB start printing money and buying every single bond issued in Europe above a certain price, regardless who is the bond from.

Inflation will rise but the markets will calm down because they cannot speculate against someone who is printing money, if they keep up the game their money (and our money) will be worth nothing. As speculators have more to lose than national governments they will stop.

true,Tartantyco,NORW,Norway,"&gt;Yes and treating someome different because of some innate traits is not the same thing as treating someome different because of his/her behaviour, beliefs, values etc. Why should these two be conflated?

Conflation is not equivocation. Besides, nothing of what you just said is relevant to the definition of racism.

&gt;But they do the same thing when they assume malicious thought when someone says something not nice about a minority group. Why they deserve more courtesy than they grant?

If you actually know what the counter-jihad group is about then you will know that they're not assuming anything.

&gt;Is it racist to treat someone differently if you strongly dislike fhis/her beliefs?

It's discriminatory. But discrimination isn't necessarily a bad thing. Which is another reason why that word is ineffectual. But if you used the word 'racist' in the context I would quite easily understand what it is you meant and I would not waste time engaging in semantics instead of arguing the actual subject.

At least the ones you mentioned that are aware of which region they come from. However, if they feel to call themselves a part of the German community, they're welcomed to do so.  
We have so many immigrants, mainly from Turkey, Poland, Russia and Italy and if they live in Germany we appreciate if they consider themselves Germans. Because calling yourself German today basically means that you live in Germany and share the opinion of the German society and take part in it: mainly our social system and values, personal rights &amp; freedom, environmental and social awareness for the sake of our children’s children and peaceful world politics. That's my interpretation of German integration. It doesn't really matter what nations passport you call your own.  
It's like a club everybody is free to join, as long as you play by the rules. As for the people living in the US: I think those who hold up German family traditions etc. are well aware of German history and our values. For the ones who's only connection to Germany is their family name ... frankly I just don't care about them. I don't know about them. If they do a little stereotypical German Volksfest in their town I don't blame them.

Chose faite, vous avez continué à poster sur /r/france, alors que ce sub devenait inapproprié pour vos soumissions, un subreddit étant désormais dédié à cela. Vous avez ensuite parler de censure lors de la suppression légitime d'un post. Puisque j'ai créé le sub, que vous n'y avez pas posté, que vous ne comprenez pas les motivations d'une modération, je vous ai donc enlevé de la liste des modérateurs. 

Je vous invite vraiment à créer votre subreddit, /r/sylvain_vasseur par exemple, et d'y concentrer toutes vos publications.

No, it doesn't sound awesome for the Spanish youth to have to live at the parents' place forever. The regular case scenario is that a 22-24yo kid that has just finished his studies hasn't been able/lucky to find a job in the last 4-6 years, which means that he might have little to zero savings. Let alone the fact that probably one of his parents - or both - is unemployed or even retired, so of course the family can't support him financially. And if he is lucky to find a job, the common behaviour would be staying at home and help to pay the rent/mortgage at least, waiting for things to get better. So, what do you expect? Because I have the strange feeling that going to the bank and ask for a loan to move somewhere else to *try to find a job* to pay it back won't work. Oh and believe me, most of us would looooove to work wherever - I have 2 degrees myself and I have been trying to get to way less qualificated jobs (basically as supermarket/stock/sales/factory staff) for years, and guess what? No luck. And I am sure this is the situation of the majority. 

This goes back to the OP question; besides all the stuff already mentioned here I also think part of the problem is the entrepreneurs' mindset - they don't want to train new employees (forget about those without previous experience in the field even if the work to do is a no-brainer), they don't want educated people, they want people doing other people's job (sometimes under the word *polyvalent*) like a brainless monkey, no matter the quality.

[Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,]

könnten Sie mir bitte mehr Informationen zukommen lassen? Wie bereits in meiner vorherigen E-Mail geschildert, ist meine Mutter vor zwei Jahren verstorben und ich habe Ihnen bereits alle mir vorliegenden Dokumente zugesandt. Meine Mutter arbeitete von 1962 bis 1965 in Baden Baden. Leider kann ich keine genaueren Angaben machen. Meine Familie kam 1962 in Deutschland an und zog 1965 wieder zurück nach Frankreich.

Könnten Sie mir bitte die genauen Gebühren nennen? (26 Euro für 2005 und 2008, 11 Euro für 2009 und 0 Euro für 2010, was in summe 115 Euro an Gebühren für den 12. September 2012 wären.)

Ich würde Sie außerdem gerne darüber informieren, dass meine Mutter in Frankreich nicht steuerpflichtig war und würde daher gerne eine Steuerbefreiung oder -entlastung beantragen.

Mit freundlichen Grüßen

When people ask me where my parents are from I just shake my head and say I don't understand how that has anything to do with you and me right now.

I really hate the idea of Hyphenated–Americans.

As a Portuguese citizen you probably understand, Portugal and Ireland have made adjustments and tried our best - yet corruption and bloated government continued unabated in Greece. From Ireland's perspective too some of the debt wasnt rightfully ours - the banking debt was forced upon us (of course it largely our fault for leaving the banks run amok in the first place).

But now.. every day the Greeks suffer. Massive wage cuts, spiraling unemployment. More slash and burn cuts can surely not be the answer. Yet the problem is that Europe simply does not know what to do. If we give Greece more money - they wont pay it back (so it seems). If we dont, their economy collapses and they go hungry, while the rest of Europe takes a hit too.
I'm really glad I'm not Greek right now. I feel sorry for the Greeks, hopefully things will start improving, but I'm not so hopeful.

Germany's share of the Greek bailout is roughly twice the Greek debt held by German banks at the beginning of the crisis. In the end, a Greek default would have been more expensive than that, because not all countries would have been able to bail out their banks after a Greek default, especially not on top of their other problems, so they would have needed help anyway. Relative to GDP (and therefore relative to the share of the bailout), Portuguese banks had lent about three times as much to Greece as Germany's.

Here's how much banks of various Eurozone countries lent to the GIIPS, pre-crisis figures are from the end of 2009, in millions US dollars, according to the BIS. You can find those figures in [this PDF](http://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qa1006.pdf), table 9B. You can find the latest figures [here](http://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qa1206.pdf), the file names follow a [YYQQ] convention. Pretty visualizations can be found [here](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/05/02/weekinreview/02marsh.html) and [here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-15748696). Note that I've swapped rows and columns for space reasons.  I've added a column with those countries' GDP, also in millions US dollars. The exchange rates have changed between those two figures, but this is just about rough proportions so it doesn't matter.

I lived for 5 for years in the Bay Area (SF), and got very good friends there. And I Liked Very Much There.
But there is a problem in the US ""diseducational"" system. 
Since babies start learning to talk, they get the message that their country (United States) is actually called America. And that America is the best, the bigger, the better, the freer, exceptional, powerful, etcetera...

By the age of 6 years most US people believe that in their guts.

After that age US people has to Learn ""healthy humility"" (The antidote).
Again, it's only a problem in the diseducational system. 

Actually I was delighted with how naïve, many people are in the US.

There are about 196 countries in the world and each one has good and wrong things, to learn ones from another.

true,[deleted],null,null,"No, but as a small country you still have access to other countries sport facilities  you couldn't afford on your own (due to being a small country). For example the Lithuanian gold medal winner Ruta Meilutyte. She lives in England so she has access to their facilities and know-how. And you have your contingent of athletes on who you can more precisely decide who will compete and develop their talent more focused on the individual.
 But there are so many factors you have to consider too, for example the demographic of a country or the climatic region. Norway for example is good in beach volleyball, but this is a sport you can train whereever you want unlike skiing. That gives northern countries like Norway an advantage for winter olympics without having a disadvantage on summer olympics like other countries have. 

Now i rant a bit about germany as the situation here is  a bit different. Here you can develop your skill in whichever sport you like, it doesn't matter if you need snow or beaches or wind or hills. We have all that somewhere in germany. And still we suck at the moment and in the recent past in olympics. And we would be fucking terrible if it weren't for Riding, Canoeing and rowing. Our athletes are happy enough to compete in the olympics, winning doesn't seem to matter for them anymore. No demanding yourself to win a medal, no ambition to become the best. That is of course not true for all our athletes but for most of them. And when it matters you can be sure that they break under the pressure. No physical or mental stability when you compare them with other athletes. Gymnastic for example is a pretty big sport in germany with a lot of funding and many athletes and yet we don't have any talent that is able to compete among the best. Or our swimmers, after they won at one olympic games and had their financial security they just took it for granted that it stays like that. In 2008 they only had some medals due to 2 athletes and 4 years later the same 2 athletees are the ones everybody hopes for that they'll maybe win a medal again. In 4 years no other athlete that came close to the other nations and nobody of the DSV admitted that they fucked up their job and they still don't see the point on changing anything.

As for the low-fat cream-cheese... The fat is what gives the taste in food, because it sticks to everything including flavours and your tastebuds (excellent ""taste conduction""), and for the same reason, it stays longer in your stomach, reinforcing its satiety mechanisms (you can eat less of it). Carbohydrates on the contrary do not solve hunger, have poor ""taste conduction"" (except for their own sweetness), trigger addiction (nope, you're not eating less of that), abuse your insulin system (which works much like tanning, one can only have so much of it before it shuts down), fuel cancer cells, etc...

There are about 700,000 people living there currently. And a vastly smaller amount in the 'dangerous' areas. 

People hold up Detroit as one of the US's greatest failures. I put it to you that it is a shining example of US stability as the cost to revive the city was more costly to the collective good than to simply disburse detroits remaining talent capital, and influence to other areas. 

Successful people moved and opene business worked in other US cities since there is almost no barrier or resistance to US citizens moving throughout the country to work or own businesses. Contrast this to Europe where german and French politicians openly oppose local competition from southern neighbors.  

The sad part is that it's a huge boon to the economy as those with the willingness and intelligence will get the chance to work and use capital. The losers are the local unskilled population who are uncooperative without protection from immigration. But it costs a lot of money to keep these *ahem* less competitive locals in jobs.

Oraindik ere amaitu gabe duten trantsizio baten seinale. Egoera egonezin baten seinale.

Baina erantzun ofizialik ez bada ere, galderek bere horretan diraute Gernika guztiotan: Zeinek? Nork agindua? Zergatik? Zertarako?. Erantzun eza are eta salagarriago suertatzen da gaur, Euskal Herrian batzuek zabaldu duten aro politiko berrian, non batzuek oroimena, justizia eta egia ahotik ahora erabiltzen duten, baina ez ehuneko ehunekoan baizik eta euren zatikako kontakizunari interesatzen zaion ehuneko pobrean baizik.

My family goes back generations of being German; my parents both were born and raised, as is every other relative I've ever known. My brother and I were born in Germany as well and have German passports. 

Here's where it gets difficult to answer. My father got a job in the US when I was just two years old, and we've lived in the United States ever since. I've spent 18 of the 20 years of my life living in the US, and can more or less say that I'm American. However, my family still practices very German traditions at home, and we still speak German at home as well. Also, we visit Germany at least once a year, and I just recently finished studying a full year in Freiburg. 

When I'm in Germany, I notice the American aspects in me, and when I'm in the states, I notice how German I am. When people ask me what I am, I still don't know what to say, so I just say that I am half and half, even though by law I am 100% German. 

Basically, using myself as an example, I would consider people their respective nationality based on what combinations of traditions they practice at home, birthright, and how much time they have actually spent there. I can't say that I am totally German because I did not grow up there or go to school there, yet I've still spent enough time there to know the culture and practice their traditions at home.

true,Spelter,THUE,Thüringen,"There are many reasons why Die Linke has so many votes in the east, ""habit"" being one of them. You'd be surprised how many elderly people, barely able to walk, will show up at point 8 in the morning on election day and without fail crack jokes about how disappointed they are that they don't receive some flowers. (As it was custom in the GDR for the first voter of the day to receive a bouquet of flowers). It's not much of a stretch to imagine they will also make their cross where they used to.  
Indoctrination of course is another factor. Shaking old views and habits is not easy when they've been ingrained into you for so long. A true believer back in the day is probably still somewhat inclined in that direction. Getting people to give up their old values is hard. You're not going to get the whole ""freedom"" thing out of an American and you're not going to get all of socialism out of an old hardcore party member.  
And then of course there's also current politics and economics. Recent upheavals and crises will always lead people towards a vote for more security, and the Germans especially are a people that values stability and security above all. So when millions in the east lost their jobs after reunification and then a global economic crisis hits just as things seemed to become better at last many longed for the securities they had in the socialist system. As long as you played along, life in the GDR could be pretty carefree. They had family politics down for example, gender equality was really high and fears like hunger, poverty or homelessness were pretty much a non-issue. The GDR tends to be vilified in German media, I've seen documentaries that made it out to be some sort of Third Reich reborn, however you'll notice that people who actually lived under the regime tend to think much less strongly about the matter and are more likely to express at least some positive views about their former country.

It's also reasonable that a lot of people in the East want more social policies than the SPD or god forbid the CDU have to offer. Most of the nostalgia for the DDR is connected to a select few political topics: housing, child care, jobs, community. That's basically the whole Scandinavia thing. That's what most of the people talk about when they say it was ""better"" before the wall came down.

&gt;I'm sure you're aware already that die Linke advocate communism/socialism (depending on the particular platform), which of course was the ideology of the DDR.

That's simply not true. The DDR was a state-run  socialist oligarchy while the Linke advocates democratic socialism (a term that was once widely used by the SPD in Germany and is still in use by many of her sister parties around Europe).

&gt;The high number of votes for die Linke in the East indicates that the voters there want more left-wing, if not communist form of government, **suggesting they would like politics more reminiscent of those back in the DDR.**

It does indeed somewhat imply the first assumption you made (want more left-wing). The wish for a communist form of government on the other hand can not be concluded from their election results since only a few nutjobs (and most of them are from the West!) advocate communism in the Linke. The East German Linke is mostly composed of the Realos (meaning they want to do politics based on reality), mainly because they actually have to govern in these parts and that always changes the perspective.

The numbers you should look up to assess if people in the East (or all of Germany for that matter) want a different system than the current ""market-based democracy"" would be voter turnout and public polls with questions like ""Are you happy with the current system of government in this country?"".

That's where you will get the prize money. It's not really about a bunch of geezers voting for the Linke. Those people are no different than the old farts in the West, voting CSU/CDU/SPD everytime and only changing between two TV channels (ARD and ZDF). They do it because they know the shit their choosing and don't plan on changing horses this late in the game unless everything completely goes to shit. The Linke is a big-tent party in the East. Yes, that has something to do with the fact that it is the successor of the SED. But that's how it goes with big tent parties... At one point you simply choose them because they've been around for a while and all the others are choosing them too, so there must be something to them.

Turns out it wasn’t just an affinity for Spreewald pickles, Trabants, and socialist idealism.

Women, especially, achieved much greater equality in the GDR than their West German counterparts. Equal education, reproductive rights, very good state-run child care, paid maternity leave, and an economic need for more productive citizens meant that 90% of women between 15 and 60 participated in the workforce, with 80% of those holding a degree beyond secondary school. East German women earned 75% of what their male coworkers earned, while West German women settled for 66%. 

My host mom explained it as such: “Western women were always looking for a husband. They needed one, for economic and social reasons. But in the GDR we were fully capable of choosing our own path. I and many of my friends chose to have children without a husband and without wanting one. We could create a career, a family, and happiness completely on our own.”

As Petra Drauschke, an East German social scientist, remarked with some irony, “For twenty years women in the West have been studying the problems and coming up with solutions pretty much like what we had.”


People forget that despite the many, many asterisks noting things like the Stasi, lack of consumer choice, and comically ugly Soviet apartment buildings, individuals were able to maintain a quality of life that, while lower in goods and services that their western counterparts, was much higher than their fellow Eastern bloc countries. I've heard so many people waxing ostalgic, but they're not dreaming of a return of the SED. They miss the ""more genuine friendships"" and the ""deemphasis of consumer goods."" 

I haven't met anyone who actually wants to go back to the DDR, but i've met plenty who think that the BRD fled too quickly in their haste to cut all ties with the scary past and would do well to take a more honest look at the institutions that the DDR got right.

If you group the EU together like has been done then you get the best of both worlds. You get the quality AND quantity due to the layered structure.

You have countries handpicking their best and they're then ALL put forth, and everyone else doing that too.

But if the EU actually was one country, then we would only handpick the best in the EU, which would pretty much come down to the ones who got into top 5 and stuff but then with much less participants put forth. Meaning they'd get the same amount of medals even though having less quantity. But what you're arguing is qualitative quantity and not quantity, so yeah. 

Imagine the US lets each state choose which of their athletes to put forth and they're then all sent and all counted under the US, even though they're actually only representing their state. That's what it's like.

true,norgesverige,null,null,"My family fled Germany during the Nazi regime because of our Jewish ancestry. Although we weren't practicing Jews and we were actually Christian at that point, we got our passports stamped with a ""J"", a couple of us died either in concentration camps or from stress, and my grandmother was put in Schutzhaft. However, my grandmother never stopped calling herself German and even today when I ask her what she thinks of Germany she says ""honest people"" and a ""wonderful childhood before Hitler"".
 
Because my true ""Germaness"" was put into question by my family's country, I live every day wondering if I'm just lying to myself when I say I'm proud to be German, or whether I'm just as German as every other German in the world. I've decided it's the latter. Why? Because although I'm not fluent in German, I speak it without any American accent whatsoever. When I hear German, I feel something different inside me that I don't feel with any of the other languages I speak (four of them) besides English. I know the German anthem by heart. I can recite all of ""Der Erlkönig"" by Goethe from memory. I know German celebrities from Marlene Dietrich to Herbert Grönemeyer to FLER. If you ask me where any German city is on a map I can probably point it out to you.

Almost every single one of my great grandparents died fighting for Germany during World War I. In fact, one of them pretended to be older than he was because he wanted to enlist but was too young. During the financial crisis my great grandfather refused to fire a single worker from the business he owned, and when it went bankrupt he started paying them out of his own pocket even though it was beginning to drive his own family to ruin. Why? Because he believed he owed it to his countrymen. These stories I've heard have really made me think about who my ""countrymen"" are. 

I think I share a German point of view on most things, but maybe not on nationalism - I think I'm more nationalistic than most Germans. After all the horrors that have occurred in the past century, the fact that Germany has been able to rise up as one of the greatest and most progressive nations makes me proud that my family comes from there. I recently applied for German citizenship, and after more than 70 years my family is finally going to be recognized as being German again. 

I don't know whether Germans will consider me German or not, or whether I can consider myself German even once i have a German passport, but I think I feel it somewhere in my heart when I hear the national anthem and get overwhelmed by something very sad, yet very proud. Maybe it's naïveté to say this, or maybe I'm just saying something I don't know about, but I think that's something that's extremely important to German culture now: continually asking how we should feel about our country and ourselves after our history. I sometimes think that those German-Americans who blindly say they love their heritage really don't understand it at all, but then maybe I'm not really German because I love Germany and I love my heritage. 

The other day I started playing the German national anthem on the piano for my grandmother, the same one who was arrested by the Nazis and thrown out of her own home country. Within seconds, she started singing the old lyrics ""Deutschland, Deutschland über alles, über alles in der Welt"", the ones that today are no longer part of the anthem. She had a big smile on her face and told me that she used to sing this all the time and had a big schwarz, rot, gold flag hanging in her room. Then she became quieter and said to me ""Germany is a wonderful country, but I can never bring myself to go back"".

The thing about an exchange year is that it can be difficult to integrate with people from the host country. My second choice would be Bilbao. I've never been but I've heard good things. 

The most important thing is where you are going to live. I got really lucky in that I found two roomates that were Spanish and were very awesome. I lived in Valencia for 7 months. The first 5 were with a Spanish host family that wasn't very nice and didn't want to have a whole lot to do with me. They basically took in students for the money. I spent the majority of time with my American classmates and learned little Spanish.

The next three months I sought out an apartment and wound up with with the cool Spanish roomates I was talking about. I learned more spanish in three months than I had in the rest of my life combined. There is simply no comparison. 

So if I were to try to repeat that experience I'd try to go to one of those two cities and try to find Spanish people who also like to take in foreign students. Make sure you have an open mind.

There is always this German stereotype. Tall, blond, blue eyes. Well, this is definitely not true for most Germans with a lot of German ancestry, but if you don't look at least similar to a West-European, people won't immediately categorize you as a German. It's not actually racist, but maybe because of the German history, people are not used to Germans with other racial history. It's also evident with the Turkish that came to Germany after the war. The following generation have been born in Germany, have German ids and are, in fact, Germans. Yet, they have big problems to integrate themselves. A big problem is that Turkish people often don't really want to be integrated. They live in Turkish communities and generally keep to themselves. Maybe the government could've done more for the integration in the past, but I guess both sides have to be blamed.

If you look Chinese you will face similar problems with some people. 

So, being German might not be solely be determined by your personal id. I guess you have to live like a German and be part of the cultural life. This is not equal to liking Germany and German culture. It's just a different experience if you went to school in Germany, were part of a Schützenfest or went on family vacations in the alps or the at the Nordsee. If you were not raised in Germany, you skipped a lot of what will determine your national identity (the part Germans have problems with). 

And finally, it's about how you feel. After living a long time in Germany, you might feel like a German, but I don't think it is instantaneously after you acquire citizenship. You have a lot to catch up.

Those who had a job that was still needed after the fall of the wall (teachers, doctors, and so on) profited. They still had a good (or even better) income after the fall of the wall.

Those who retired in the 90's profited very much as well. They were still young enough to travel the world with the new money and freedom they got.

But the people that had state subsidiet job back in the GDR mostly lost
their jobs, didn't get a good pension after the fall and so on. 

Plus all the people that lived in the GDR grow old. And for (mostly) all old people everything was better back in the days. They were fit and young and remember the good times they had.

&gt; What kind of metro ticket's should we buy? We're gonna spend 5 days in Paris

I think the carnet (10 tickets at a time) will be your best bet. The missus and I were there for two weeks in April and rode the Metro a lot, and buying carnets worked out fine for us. There are other options, but as I recall you need to have a small passport-sized photo of yourself to use on it. I forget the cost of a carnet already, but be aware there are some Metro stations that will take Euro coins only, no paper. We were lucky in that the station near our flat (Madeline) took paper, but just something to be aware of.

&gt; What's the easiest way to get to Versailles palace

Don't know about the fountains (we didn't make it to Versailles), but there is an RER that will get you there. IIRC, I think we saw people catching it at Chatelet les Halles. I think it will be pretty easy and obvious once you get comfortable on the Metro. Be aware your standard Zone 1 Metro ticket won't get you to Versailles. You will need to get the proper zone ticket. This will all make more sense once you get familiar with the Metro system.

&gt; Any recommendations on which attraction to visit on which day of the week

The Eiffel Tower had one of the lifts down for maintenance when we were there in April. Don't know if that's still the case, but the line was about a 2 hour wait to get up there. Museums are closed various days of the week. Most good tourist guides will make mention of the dark days.

&gt; Do you recommend visiting Disney Land

We did not go. You're in Paris, I think you'll find plenty of romantic stuff to do. A walk down the Seine would he many times more romantic than Disney for my money. Just my opinion.

My last tip. Find yourself a copy of a city map called Paris Par Arrondissement, as mentioned here: http://postedinparis.wordpress.com/tag/paris-par-arrondissement/ They are available at virtually all of the newsstands you'll see. This is the best map I've used for any of the cities that I've visited.

Well you were 5 years old...

&gt; The factories where a lot people worked had to close because the things they were producing have not been needed anymore because importing from other countries was mostly cheaper or better quality. Also all the jobs that were subsidized by the GDR got cancelled. So many people lost their jobs.

They weren't needed before but simply subsidized in a broken economic system. There's a reason the GDR failed.

&gt; Life was better for them in those days

In retrospect people simply see things much nicer. Sure some people lost a lot. But that was bound to happen because the GDR was a failing system. But the standard of living is now much higher.

Unfortunately, some young people in my generation fail to go through this stage of familiarization, and they feel awkward without a frame of reference in the other language (it's hard to crack jokes when you're not entirely sure the other person understands you), so they will just communicate in English.

You have to complain with those who created laws that allow them. I'm pretty sure that cutting on pensions once you have acquired the right to them would be against the constitution. In fact, cutting on _future_ mega pensions for the rich is something Monti did, by eliminating the computation of pensions based on the average wage from the last 10 years.

I agree that everything else you said would be nice, but you do not change the mentality of 60 million people (with respect to corruption + tax evasion) in 2 weeks like he had to when he was elected, and finding waste is a monumental job of its own.

&gt; Are you talking about Turks that do not speak German among themselves?

I am talking about every single immigrant group - and that includes Romanians as well as Turks - not speaking German among themselves. In effect, what happens is that they start to live among themselves, and we get ghettoized districts in out cities, which leads to feedback loops (""I am never leaving the Kiez anyways, so why should I learn German?"").

&gt; Because it has two language groups...

You are advocating Presaca (just to pick an example), a community of about a thousand villagers, be populated with 50% non-Romanian speakers? In reality, a bilingual village has one language group speaking two languages, their mother tounge they will fall back to, and another language they might have learned in school, but are not very competent in on average.

&gt; Either, it won't work, or we are killing the existing languages - which noone really wants.

A group of people living amongst themselves does not need more than one common language. Talks in the local pub are not switching between English and Romanian frequently. Local languages are tailored to local problems (See Sapir–Whorf hypothesis), there are things that matter for the Romanian population that can be expressed much better in Romanian than, say, Chinese, because the Chinese never faced them.

So what happens is that the secondary language is used less frequently and eventually vanishes **unless** it is needed for meeting with non-locals. Which for the general population happens infrequently and thus it's effect negligable. At best, you get some pidginized English for intercultural exchange.

Of course, you can have some sort of state-mandated enforcement of a new language, punishing old-language speakers. Not only will this be highly popular, it also comes off as cultural genocide, and has been used as that again and again, especially in the USSR and in China, but also in the colonial powers.",0,1344332704,null,0,false,0,c5pensx,t3_xs7fb,t1_c5pensx,t1_c5pel2z,null,1429573722,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

I am not talking about crime statistics in the source countries (that cannot be trusted). I am talking about crime statistics of immigrant populations that are already here (see the linked Immigration and Crime wiki article).

&gt;Additionally this kind of reasoning, that punishes individuals for crimes comitted by someone else (deemed to be part of the same culture by someone) goes against the human rights that you are trying to safeguard.

Being allowed to immigrate is a privilege, not a right. Discrimination is OK when it comes to privileges. And unless you can read minds, we cannot determine in advance who is a criminal or fundamentalist, so we have to use statistics and group discrimination.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;'Driving away foreigners' - yes, you and other people that share your ideology tend to forget the word 'illegal' before immigrant. Always trying to turn this into racism.

You still don't get it how deeming people ""illegal"" is really against all the supposed values and human rights that the western world says it upholds... You just deem them illegal because they are poor. If a rich Iranian guy wants to live in the EU it would never be a problem for him to acquire papers - his poor fellow citizens thought would be ""illegal"". You really don't see the irony here? 

&gt;Why do you want to ignore all the articles about how many billions illegal immigrants cost Greece each year?

This is in favour of my argument actually. We spent billions on detention centers, guards, patrols, walls, enforcement, technology of surveillance, paperwork and yet the problem isn't solved - only getting worse. Enforcement isn't the way to deal with immigration in today's world - that's what I am saying. It leads nowhere, it will only makes things worst, more people will die and be tortured and our countries will end up undemocratic police states. Also, another irony: you know that the Greek state [makes more money](http://www.avgi.gr/ArticleActionshow.action?articleID=621553) out of taxing immigrants than shipowners? There hundreds of ways that we get out of this fucking crisis but they are not in favor of the rich, the IMF, the EU Central Bank and you are trying to convince me how immigrants bring Greece down! If a fair way of dealing with the problem was followed everybody, Greeks and immigrants would fit in this country just fine!

Furthermore in all the arguments about driving away immigrants everybody seem to forget how much they have helped the Greek economy and how much they still do. And of all those thousands immigrants everybody never mentions that the big percentage of them are just hardworking people trying to make a living - do you know how many Albanian families since the 90s have settled in Greece and how much they have helped in the economy - now they are so integrated to the Greek society that you wouldn't even know they are from Albania, their kids don't even want to learn Albanian. Everybody is just focusing on those who commit crimes - and I am not saying that this is not a reality but what did you except especially when they are forced to try and survive in a system that exploits them - many will choose the criminal way.

You presuppose that immigrants ""bring your country down"". That's something that the media and the politicians want you to think - because it's easier to accuse them than ourselves, the EU and the economic system. Even ""rich"" countries cannot handled the immigration phenomenon because as I said it's huge. What I am trying to say to you is that a change of minds and practices is required throughout the western world to deal with this issue - temporary solutions won't stop the waves of immigrants. I am not arguing that immigration doesn't bring problems in the host countries, of course it does, but it is because the system is designed that way - it's a system of exclusion and banishment and economic inequality. 

&gt;So what is your view on this?

My view is that every human being should be treated as equal first and foremost - nobody should be deemed ""illegal"" - otherwise we are just hypocrites and we should burn the conventions on human rights and protection of refugees that we are so proud of in the western world. Then we should stop enforcement and help those people integrate to our societies so as not to choose underground and criminal ways of doing things (and that would mean bring down all the networks of trafficking and illegal labour that are so much profiting all around Europe many times in cooperation with state authorities). Then the rich western world should help the third world countries where these people come from to stand on their feet - only this will stop all these people coming to Europe for a better tomorrow. But I guess it's more convenient for us to have all our factories-sweatshops there and consume all the resources of the world like spoiled fat kids.

I know what you are going to say - how is Greece supposed to do that when everything is shit now - and I agree with you, there is no work for nobody anyway, how are all these people are going to ""integrate"". It's a desperate situation but I would never support enforcement - it will only makes things worse and polarize our society (it already has). As I said if our leaders wanted there are ways of getting out of this mess that would be fair to all. But yeah who am I kidding now, right? 

What I am saying to you is simple: yes it's an issue, yes there are problems but even you force them out (by spending millions and millions) they will come back because that's the state of the planet now. So instead it's better we work together. Turn your anger and frustration towards the one that brought you here in the first place. The ones truly responsible. A few months ago I was robbed on the streets by immigrants - they took my mobile phone and 50 euro I had in my wallet. Should I be fucking agree to all immigrants? Wait, let's compare the money that immigrants have stolen from me and the money that the fucking Greek state with all the corrupted officials and politicians have stolen from me. Yeah, I shouldn't be agree at the immigrants.

The DDR failed due to peoples distrust and oppressive nature of the regime, plus (I suspect) the the realisation that the Soviet union was starting to crumble.

You just deem them illegal because they are poor. If a rich Iranian guy wants to live in the EU it would never be a problem for him to acquire papers - his poor fellow citizens thought would be ""illegal"". You really don't see the irony here? 

Well, believe it or not there are still laws. Laws make a society work. If a person crosses the border of a country without permission from that country then he/she is illegal. If country needs more workforce (e.g. Australia) then they consider applications for immigrations on the field needed. If not, then nobody enters. It is daft to accept immigrants when you do not have the power to provide for them and at the same time deteriorate the standard of living of the nationals. As I said, if you can, you help, if you cannot, you don't. And clearly Greece is way over the number of immigrants that it can provide for.

&gt;This is in favour of my argument actually.....

Ok, why do I have to mention it in every comment? There is a distinction between legal and illegal immigrants. It is people like you that want to turn this matter into a xenophobic one. Did this article mentioned that we are deporting legal immigrants? No. It said that we are deporting illegal immigrants. The distinction that is always deliberately forgotten. Now the link you provide from the lefting site is obviously laughable. I do not think that anyone taxes the 1.5 illegal immigrants. The rest that are legal yes, they have, and should have  all the obligations and benefits that a Greek citizen has. But even if I accept those 50 mil that you link it is nothing but a drop in the ocean compared to the billions of euros illegal immigrations costs the country. 


Finally you say you understand the situation, you keep your beliefs but you do not provide any real solution.

Or two language groups speaking two languages. For example a village/town in Szekler Land. Romanians have the mother tongue, plus a language that is used extensively around them and they pick up as a consequence, plus it has a degree of official status. The Hungarians have their mother tongue, plus the Romanian used around them, which is also the taught in school, as the official language of the land.

It's not uncommon in Targu Mures - for example - to hear people talking to each other switching from Romanian to Hungarian.

&gt;So what happens is that the secondary language is used less frequently and eventually vanishes unless it is needed for meeting with non-locals. Which for the general population happens infrequently and thus it's effect negligable.

Isn't this expected to increase with the European integration and all?

Discrimination is not ok when it comes to priviliges, that's something you just declared now. Discrimation goes against the very foundation of law and human rights, which hold that the /individual/ is the holder of these rights. Individual being the most important word there. We ought to all be equal before the law, so any law passed to discriminate against individuals  based on their culture and not on their own individual actions in the way you propose goes against this fundamental principle. 

Acceptable collateral damage? this is exactly what I'm getting at, either people are equal before the law or they are not.

Da Menschen (oder auch Einwohner) einen Machtfaktor darstellen und das Grundinteresse eines Staates überleben, bzw. Sicherheit ist, fördert der Staat die Ehe, bzw. auch Kinder. 

Während dieser Punkt bei gleichgeschlechtlichen Ehen in der Regel nicht zutrifft, ist ein anderer Punkt durchaus von Belang: Paare oder Familien verbrauchen in der Relation weniger Energie als Singles, produzieren weniger Müll etc. Gehen wir davon aus, dass wir in Zukunft eher weniger als mehr Energie und Rohstoffe zur Verfügung haben, bzw. das was wir haben besser nutzen müssen, lohnt sich auch hier wieder eine Förderung. Deshalb muss sich auch keiner beschweren, wenn alleinstehende mehr zahlen müssen, sie kosten auch mehr und bringen dem deshalb Staat letztlich weniger.

Wie also gezeigt, hat der Staat ein Interesse an gewissen Ergebnissen des Zusammenlebens die ihm Vorteile verschaffen und fördert diese durch Boni, was sein gutes Recht ist. Die Ehe offiziell zu machen (also standesamtlich) ist dann letztlich nur eine Verwaltungsangelegenheit, hat aber den schönen Nebeneffekt, dass Paare eher geneigt sind zu versuchen Beziehungen zu retten, weil die Trennung ja selbst wieder ein komplizierter und langwieriger Vorgang ist.

Aus den vorgenannten Gründen bin ich für eine völlige Gleichstellung gleichgeschlechtlicher Paare.

No, this is ridiculous. You cannot coordinate such an action on a such big scale, most people dont care beyond stating their opinion. And besides, opinion polls are just one of the means to determine the cultural attitude.

Obiang's father has ruled Equatorial Guinea since 1979 and I would assume that he is, in the fine tradition of dictatorial kleptocracies, lined up to take over the Presidency as heir apparent. Under those circumstances is there really any significant difference between state property and the personal property of the ruling family?

I suppose the case could be made that it's used for state functions in much the same way as an ambassadorial residence; however I would have thought that it would be necessary to have made the French government aware that the property served such a purpose.

Oh, and I forgot the salad which is often eaten with or just before the cheese.

To be honest, none of this is mandatory. A real, normal meal that you'll eat during the week or for example at a school restaurant will probably only consist of a starter, main course, dessert and cheese or a yogurt.

But at special occasions (guests over, christmas, marriage..) the meal might last something like 4 hours and consist of the whole thing: Aperetif, starter(s), main course, salad, cheese, dessert, and some alcohol (digestif), and then coffee.

Regarding my favorite home meal, there are so many options... Well, to give an example, the other day, for dinner, I ate a tomato salad with greek cheese, then a tuna pie, and a yoogurt. That could be a normal meal. A meal with my siblings and cooked by my mom could be something like melon with cured ham for starter, then a ""hachis parmentier"", my dad love cheese, so always a slice of 4-5 different cheeses, and for dessert an apple pie with a bit of vanilla ice cream.

At my grandparents it would always be the same thing: an aperetif, cold (but cooked) fish with mayonnaise and boiled eggs (often presented as ""oeufs mimosas"", that is mayonnaise mixed the yellow part of the egg and put back in the half-egg. Then a roti with homemade fries and green beans, and for dessert often a mousse au chocolat or a charlotte au chocolat, and then the cofee with some biscuits.

To be honest, there are sooo many variations possible that it's hard to pinpoint one favorite meal, for me at least. I didn't quote many of my favorite dishes that are mostly eaten in winter (ratatouille, tartiflette, osso-buco(it's italian, but well), pot au feu, cassoulet, fondue savoyarde, fondue bourguignonne, blanquette de veau, boeuf bourguignon, paupiettes d'agneau, choucroutte, galettes bretonnes and so many more...)",0,1344340747,null,0,false,0,c5pffw4,t3_xorek,t1_c5pffw4,t1_c5p5oua,null,1435694601,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Well, keeping drugs illegal is not optimum, it doesn't stop people from taking them unfortunately. Heroin is clearly a dark substance to be meddling with, but it should be treated as a medical problem. The thing is if you remove the illegality of these substances, you also remove a lot of drug related crime. 

If you look at the damage that is being caused by current industrial practices, it's clearly a path we're going to have to slowly change in the future, we MUST remove our dependancy on oil and other fossil based fuels. But I doubt Der Linke want full scale de-industialization that you're attempting to pointing out, i'd love a citation if possible. 

In my opinion, the future is going to be more internet based along with micro-industrial complexes, we have to think of redesigning out civilisation into a more environmentally friendly approach to industrial production, the only way is by implementing more localised mechanisms. I heard a great idea that electricity should be generated by each household individually and have a world wide power grid, so everyone contributes to the grid, meaning if there isn't enough light (in solar terms) in one part of the world, it can be substituted by another part and so on. Truly distributed approaches towards industry has to be adopted for the sake of our future.

true,elperroborrachotoo,null,null,"I am certainly not voting for the Linke, or want to ""go back"", but here's my take.
(Reference: I was in Senior High School when the wall came down.)

**Stability and predictability.** You could bet your life on a certain career or path.  Learn a profession, get a job, work your life in that job. If you didn't know what to do, there were certainly ... suggestions. Anyway, knowing there is always a way getting through your life with a miniscule rent for a decent apartment and a job does people well.

Contra:
The hard resistance your wishes were way off the suggestions. This fight could destroy your life.  
The compromises you had to make for a ""real"" career (You have today as well, but some of them were really ugly and affecting not only yourself). 

**A job for virtually everyone.** And I mean it. Most departments had their slacker, their alcoholic, not contributing much. 

Why is this a good thing? There's a range of people who needed that force to get into clothes and out of the house every day. I am certain it helped a lot of people getting by and not ending up in the gutter. IN addition, they were a kind of buffer when there's was a peak in work load, you *could* mobilize them. 

**Excellent free education** 

Contra: mandatory political education. 

**Money doesn't buy you everything.** At least, not east marks. It would certainly open up options, but for the majority, most wishes, plans and desires were not achievable by having enough money. 

**The little pleasures of scarcity**  

Sharing one of the rare watermelon with your family. Getting someone a record for their birthday that they just couldn't go out and carry home the same day. 

**Attitude of society**  
Looking back, it was *not* expected that everyone is a crook, and every deceit is the victims fault as long as the deceit was not prohibited by law. 

Contra: your best friend might record your most private talks. 
Leads to self-policing, which, while up to a point a plus for the attitude. Long term and with its excess, it was probably the most destructive aspect for society.

Have you actually dealt with language death, bilingualism or languages outside their home country? Your counter examples (later in this thread) are not very good. Unlike Hungarian/Romanian, Sorbic is useless outside the villages, it has no nation to back it, it's not needed outside the home. I would not be surprised if its prestige amongst the Sorbs is very low. Despite state backing, the Sorbs are a very small group (unlike Frisians, who in the past judged their own language to be of low prestige).

Turkish &amp; Romanian, are backed by nation as the official language, as a place to live, where millions of people use it and cultural products such as books, movies &amp; newspapers are released.

Bilingualism is very much possible even for the village idiots. Bavarian, Swiss German (not languages but different enough that I in northern Germany can't understand them) are still alive and I presume most speakers could talk and definitively understand Hochdeutsch, it might not be perfect but enough to converse. If you really want to learn more about bi-/trilingualism take a closer look at Romania/Hungary (which German schools too, a friend from there wound up trilingual) or Swedish in Finland, mixed with English.

What minority languages imho need is state backing (schools, official language status), a big enough peer group (for day to day use outside the home and literature) and a sufficient social prestige (for parents wanting/not objecting that their kids learn it). With those things even idiots should be able to command two or more languages.

true,StoneCall,SACH,Leipzig,"&gt; The problem is that the industry in the GDR was centuries behind the rest of Europe.

Depended on the industry - most of the heavy industry was at 50s-60s Western standards; some industry was on almost equal footing (like Carl Zeiss Jena) and the rest was somewhere in-between.

Some of them collapsed anyway, for instance IT was only around five years behind the West - but only because five years was the time necessary to copy Western designs and software and put a different label on them. Obviously, this would be unusable after the Wende.

&gt; A high-paid job in the GDR doesn't necessarily mean, your job would be in high demand after the reunification. 

There were actually large-scale re-training efforts, but they just delayed the problem. For instance, shortly after the Wende, a large number of former heavy industry workers was trained in construction work. That secured them a job for the next five to ten years, when a number of dilapidated buildings were renovated, but then the constant stream of renovations stopped, and demographics means there's also not a lot of new construction. Now they're old enough so nobody would hire and re-train them again, but young enough so they can't retire.

&gt; Also a high wage in the GDR isn't even close to what a high wage is elsewhere.

For people in the GDR, it was. Of course your high wage wouldn't get you a train ticket to Hanover or a non-shitty car, but your neighbor couldn't buy them, either.

What they see is: they lived a good life (by late 1980s GDR standards) and now live a shitty life (by early 2010s FRG standards). They do not compare them objectively or consider the difference in standards.

&gt; Since most of your living was paid by the state anyway, you don't need a lot of money to be good off. There was not a lot of luxuries to buy anyway.

On the LHC discovery:

* There's Neil deGrasse Tyson complaining that the Higgs Boson wasn't discovered in the US. Comment: [""clicked on the link fully expecting a Debbie Downer for 4th of July. Was not surprised.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/w16uw/neil_degrasse_tyson_on_independence_day/c59ctke).

* Article: [Why the Higgs boson wasn’t discovered in America](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/w2xer/why_the_higgs_boson_wasnt_discovered_in_america/). Third highest comment just drops all pretense and states ""The US still dominates science like this.""

On the Mars landing:

* True, the response wasn't really ""America - Fuck Yeah!"", but there was not any real question that the breakthrough *was* just that: American. 

* Then there's [""The United States of Space""](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/xsryp/black_bush_was_more_insightful_than_i_could_have/), and [""US steals the show""](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/xspry/i_just_realized_the_us_always_steals_the/). Those are of course meme posters, so not entirely to be taken serious, but they at least can give an impression of a common feeling.

Okay, I'm done. I'm not claiming Europeans are angels, and we had our share of fun when we posted on r/europecirclejerk about the LHC, but it is my impression that there was much more patriotism around both breakthroughs (US self-flagellation in the case of the LHC, pride in the Mars landing case now) coming from the US than from Europeans as a whole.

&gt; And this is why your argiment for bi-lingualism falls apart: those are not different languages, but dialects. Try talking in English to them and see them fall apart (all of them have had at least 5 years of English in Sekundarstufe II).

I know that they're not languages and stated so, apart from that do you know what's the difference between a dialect and a language?

Their lack of English skills has nothing to do with bilingualism here. English is neither an official language of the place they are living in nor their mother tongue.

There’s no way the Swedes would pick up arms for free, after 2 centuries of peace and being accustomed to a good standard of living, rich people make very poor unpaid soldiers. Swedes are thoroughly unprepared for tough times, especially war. There would certainly be a loud voicing of discontentment, but I don’t see it escalating into war if the new government simply intended to replace the current Swedish government. Unless the new “management” insisted on implementing conservative religious laws I think it would be a *relatively* peaceful takeover. Lots of protests, hooliganism, but not full out war.

When polled in 2005, 51% of respondents to an EU survey reported that they could speak English ([Page 4](http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_243_sum_en.pdf)), while 77% of respondents believed that children should be taught English as a foreign language (same study, page 9).

These are apparently allowed according to the Reinheitsgebot because technically they are made from hops and barley.  Even more interesting is that to make a beer cloudy for a Naturtrueb, brewers will add a substance that causes some organic material in the beer to precipitate.  Then, because the additive is very large, they can filter it out, leaving the beer trueb and technically still composed of only barley, hops, and water (i.e. brewed according to the Reinheitsgebot).

true,Akasa,UKGB,journey before destination,"    &gt;How many foreign languages do you learn during 12 years of school (plus college)?

I think it depends on where in the country you're educated, for myself you were assigned a language to learn out of French and German, there was no choice and it basically came down to your tutor group. You learn them for 3 years within the tutor group structure, then with GCSE's you were assigned a group base on your proficiency. The exams were split into Oral and Written sections.

At no point was any choice involved for me.

    &gt;When do you start the first language? What about the second one (if it's the case)

At the Age of 11/12 when you start secondary schooling, you learn it up to the age of 16. You're able to choose it for further education but I've never met anyone who bothered.

    &gt;Which are the preferred languages?

French, German and I believe Spanish is available at other schools.

    &gt;Any other info regarding this subject you might find relevant (like facilities for minorities to learn their respective languages and so on)?

My lessons were very rigid, mostly learning from a text book and repeating things like parrots. My first visit to Germany was as part of my foreign language education. At no point during that trip was there any education and involved and my friends and I only had the chance to independently use the language 2 of 3 times in the space of the week, and only then short simple sentences. While in school I was in the ""top"" group, and very few people in that class considered it a worthwhile expenditure of time. I was one of those people, and consequently didn't learn anything. (Still managed a C in German, with nothing but the ability to hold a conversation at what I would imagine is what a native speaker would manage at the age of 2)

I'm probably going to get castrated here, but in my opinion languages education is a waste of students time, and would be better spent elsewhere.

true,Reilly616,EURO,European Union,"In Ireland:

We generally learn through English.
At age 4 or 5 we start Primary School, where we start learning Irish. Other languages would only be learned as a fun activity, for example, I did a year or two of French, only actually learning a few phrases.
At around age 12 we move on to Secondary school. Some of these schools teach solely through Irish, but these are in the vast minority. In this school we generally choose one European language, the order of preference generally being French, German, Spanish. We learn these until we are 18 and ready to go to University. To get in to most courses in University it is required that we speak English, Irish and any third language (In my case German).

That's how it is structured, but it doesn't work very well. Most people leave Secondary school with 5 years of their third language and after a couple years with no practice they are back to almost square one. Where Irish is concerned, we learn it for about 12 or 13 years, so we don't forget it entirely and most people could have a rudimentary conversation in it, but that's the extent for most people. Those who did Secondary school through Irish will generally be fluent in it.

I continued German (alongside Law) in University, and there is where the level really ramps up. I spent my third year of University studying in Germany, so I've become near enough to fluent to be very comfortable speaking it (in academic terms, I would be around the high end of B2, where A1 is total beginner and C2 is fluency/native speaker). For one term in Germany I also learned French (through German), completing an A1 course. Most people with me also did another language at beginner level, mainly Spanish. 

So, to sum up:

I am Irish, 21 years old. My mother tongue is English. I'm on my way to fluency in German. I have basic enough Irish (conversational) but don't get to practice it often. And finally, I've made a start on French, which I intend to keep up.

At age 12-13, when going to highschool, those that elect to follow Latin get Latin. I also had some basics of Ancient Greek at that age in Latin class.

Age 13-14, we got English, although most people in my grade (I stopped Latin and started Economics-Modern Languages) already were pretty sufficient in English.

Then at age 16-17, I also got German. Depending on the study, others have Spanish. I'm not sure if there are other languages officially taught in school.


So now here I am: I'm fluent in Dutch and English (and West-Flemish dialect). I'm a bit worse in French, but I can more than hold my own in conversations (I need a lot of French at my job: a lot of Walloon and French co-workers).

1. All Belgians forcibly learn at least one of the country's other official languages (and the 3 official languages are Dutch, French and German). Most students will also learn English as 3rd language during high school. ([legal link in Dutch: French is obligatory in Flanders from 5th grade lower school](http://www.ond.vlaanderen.be/edulex/database/document/document.asp?docid=13480)) So Flemish children learn French, and Walloon children learn Dutch from a young age (about 10 years). Other languages are introduced in high school, but it depends on what direction you choose. Some students go for a language oriented high school degree, and learn at least English and German. Others go for a math-heavy choice, and they will have no German courses and relatively less English hours.    
2. Therefore, you start official courses in the first (mother) language at 6, and in a second language (not English) at 10.     
3. English is the preferred/popular foreign language for most youngsters, because French is harder to learn for the Dutch speakers, and vice versa.    
4. Bachelors and first year of Masters are by law taught in Dutch, resp. French, or German depending in what part of the country you go to university.

I currently study in Freiburg and it is common for kids here to start French in elementary school (age 6) and only to get into English in 5 grade (age 11). French will also be continued and/ or switched to Latin. Courses in other languages (eg. Spanish) are optional.  
I myself learned English from 3rd grade onwards in elementary school. In seventh grade I could choose Latin or French at a Gymnasium focused on the humanities and exchange programs conducted in English. I chose Latin and cannot speak a single sentence in French to this day.  
My Spanish is getting there though, since the Uni Freiburg requires a second modern language at least at A2 level, for those who want to study history. The language requirements depend on what courses you want to take. Studying Greek history or Theology will of course require old Greek.  

In short: Its a clusterfuck and you should look at what courses the schools in your area offer. Bilingual Gymnasiums are also avaiable for example. It would be best, but is impossible, to choose your elementary school according to future plans regarding your career, etc.

For public schools you take English from third or fourth grade until 9th grade. German used to be mandatory as well but is now offered in 7th grade together with French. In some schools German is mandatory still with French being an elective from the 8th grade. Some private schools offer more than this.

After 9th grade you can opt to go for a 10th grade, where you continue with your languages. This is not high school but an offer for students not at that level (yet).

You have to have another foreign language, also for two years, which can be what you have previously studied, or you can start from scratch in a new language.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; In my experience, older employees are more obeying, never contradict to a boss, work more, and have more experience in managing people.

Organizations where I have worked are more or less self-guiding, you don't have clear bosses who dictate what to do, but they are more or less guides and controllers who give a vision or target where the organization should go or achieve, then people self organize and start working to fulfil the goal. Actually in many jobs it is very important that people are pro-active and start work by themselves or actively search and suggest new things to work on.

Oh, and by the way, working more usually doesn't produce more. Again all organizations where I have worked have insisted that people only work 8 hour days because that way their output remains the same in the long term. Usually people who constantly work longer than 8 hour days produce actually less than people who do normal work days.

&gt; Most of the jobs are repetitive process which can be learned in a month, not much of a productivity raise there.

Those jobs are perfect match for increased automation be it done with industrial robots or more intelligent IT-systems. Again, by allowing companies to fire people easily, you remove obstacles from them to increase their productivity by moving into automated systems.

&gt; Truth is that there simply aren't enough jobs for everyone. 

That simply isn't true. There is so much work in the world that needs to be done. The problem is that we don't have right kind of people meeting right kind of firms in right kind of place.",0,1344360660,null,0,false,0,c5pjpje,t3_xtg21,t1_c5pjpje,t1_c5piwfk,null,1429576216,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

English education starts from 5th grade(10 years old). But the intensity varies for different primary schools.
I got French education when i went to high school at age 12. Because of my school type Latin was also mandatory. 

German education started from 8th grade (age 13) and at my school also ancient Greek was mandatory.

From the 10th grade, it was possible to drop languages, but still basic French, basic German and English were mandatory (things have changed now) 

End result after all of these languages? I can't speak French nor German, which sucks living in Brussels. I can read some Latin (which helped when learning Portuguese) and I know the Greek alphabet. Only my English and Dutch are of native quality. So i feel a bit sympathetic towards the English guy here, that languages are a waist of time.

SIDE NOTE in Friesland, Frysian is also taught but i don not know the exact ages when it's given.

What we've found is that if enough speakers of the same language can band together and form their own neighborhoods and societies, they will be slower to learn the dominant language.  And in the southwestern US, Mexican immigrants might not learn much English, but their children will, and their grandchildren might not learn Spanish at all.  (This is all from memory, there's definitely more nuance than that; maybe ask /r/linguistics for help on this.)

In Penn Jillette's book, I learned that there are Hasidic communities in Brooklyn that are so isolated, they learn English as their third language, after Yiddish and Hebrew.

Die Texte sind aus dem [offiziellen XML-Release vom BMJ](http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/) ins Markdown Format konvertiert worden. Der Autor Stefan Wehrmeyer sagt aber selbst dass das dort verwendete XML-Format unbefriedigend ist, da das Markup nicht komplett semantisch, sondern für Layout-Zwecke missbraucht worden ist. Der Konverter muss deshalb zusätzliche Arbeit verrichten, die man sich eigentlich hätte sparen können.

Zu deiner Kritik am gewählten Format: Markdown ist im Gegensatz zu XML ein *besonders geeignetes Format* um eine Diff-Ansicht zwischen verschiedenen Gesetzesversionen zu ermöglichen. Siehe dazu [die aktuelle Änderung des BGB.](https://github.com/bundestag/gesetze/commit/6e103c98f49878954cef4b3fe14fc984915c701b)

In polish education there is 1+6+3+3 system. There is obligatory (since 2008 maybe) 0 grade (""Zerówka"") for 6 year old children and those classes are organized either in primary schools or kindergardens. At the age of 7 kids go to the first grade of primary school (Szkoła Podstawowa). For three years they are in something called ""nauczanie początkowe"" (erm, ""primary learning""?) when they have one teacher (apart from e.g. music teacher, p.e. teacher or catechist - but all main classes like maths, polish or science are beeing taught by one teacher). 

Often children start to learn english in kindergarden or 0 class. But mandatory foreign language courses start in 4th grade (maybe something changed since my younger brother attended to school). Usually it's parents choice if they want to their kid to learn languages earlier and usually those courses are free. And, of course, there must be an initiative from a managment of a school and from municipality. But usually those kind of courses are availible.

In 4th grade of primary school things change and kids have a lot more classes and responsibilities -&gt; they have separate teachers for diffrent subjects and spend more time at school. And they start learning foreign language. For me it was german as an obligatory class but my school opened also russian and english classes (and I was delighted to use this opportunity, what a nerdy id I was). Nowadays english is almost always the first language. In the nineties it was diffrent - as I have written I've learned german, some of the people I know have learned french. During the communism russian was the first foreign language.

Ok, primary school ends with a competency test. I was one of the first age groups to write it. After this every child has to go to a ""gimnazjum"" (*gymnasium* or middle school). Curriculum again is widened - science classes are divided between biology, chemistry, geography and physics, there is a new subject called ""wiedza o społeczeństwie"" (knowledge about society). There is one obligatory language - usually english (almost always - I have not heard about any other case). And often there are complimentary classes of some other languages, I've had german (but not for long, others didn't attend it so the class was dissmissed, I've had to learn in a private language school). Gimnazjum ends with an exam (in my times it had two parts - humanities (polish and history) and science (mainly maths but also biology, chemistry, physics and geography) now kids have also an obligatory english test)).

The last step of formal education is szkoła ponadgimnazjalna (""After-gymnasium school"" or high school). And there are four types: liceum ogólnokształcące (LO, academic high school -&gt; I've attended this one type so I'll write about it, we only learn academic stuff there, no specialized knowledge which you can use in work), liceum profilowane (LP, specialized high school - it seems that they want to close them all, apart from academic knowledge you learn things that you can use in your future work and it depends of profile -&gt; forestry, economics, fashion, you name it), technikum (vocational high-school; you have a knowledge needed in a certain type of job after it [like cook]) and zasadnicza szkoła zawodowa (ZSZ, it is a year longer and you learn a very certain profession like tailoring or blacksmith). There are also artistic schools. 

In liceum you have to learn two languages. Mandatory english and the second one. Usually german, sometimes french. Very rarely russian or latin. Some schools offer more languages, almost everyone attends private lessons. High school ends with matura or egzamin dojrzałości (a maturity exam) -&gt; mandatory polish, maths (I was the last year when maths wasn't mandatory), foreign language and one chosen by a student (history, wiedza o społeczeństwie/knowledge about society, geography, chemistry, physics and astronomy, biology, knowledge about dance, philosophy, history of music, history of arts, computer science, latin language and antic culture, ethnic minority language, local language - cassubian, national minority language. Languages that you can choose as a foreign language: english, french, spanish, italian, german, russian. National minority language that you can choose (only if your school was a special school that offered a minority curriculum): belarusian, lithuanian, ukrainian.

Another language (generally French, sometimes German) is taught in secondary school (11-12 years old) and it stops being mandatory soon. The level achieved after this is very poor.

Latin and Greek are taught only if you choose to do so.

Even if you don't believe it, Spain is one of the countries where most English classes are given, however as very few of those classes are taught in English the resulting level of the students is quite low. 

There are very few good English teachers. One of the reasons for this is that during Franco's dictatorship (till the 80's) English wasn't taught at all in schools, only French and Latin were mandatory.

1. How many foreign languages do you learn during 12 years of school (plus college)?  In first through eighth grade, schools make an effort to begin teaching a foreign language.  At my grade school, the only option was Spanish, and it was required as a once-a-week class every year, along with classes like music, gym, art, etc.  The first six or so years were basically colors, numbers, ""Como te llamas?"" The last two or so years, our teacher made a very half-assed attempt to try verbs.  It was enough to convince me to switch to French in high school.  Here, we had it daily, and I learned enough to have a conversation and probably survive in Paris.  I'm continuing with French in college (it's my major), but continued study depends on your area of study and your university.

2. When do you start the first language? What about the second one (if it's the case):  Usually early- to middle-grade school, but it depends on the school.  You may be required to take one, or more, or have the choice available, or not have the opportunity to learn one before high school.

3. Which are the preferred languages?  Spanish classes at my high school were usually the go-to.  French classes were usually tied with the Latin classes as far as number of students (my French IV class had four girls).  Greek language and culture was offered as an elective.  My high school was made up of about 750-some kids spread between four grades.  Some other high schools (public ones of many more students) offered things like German and Russian.

All they needed is to blindly listen to the orders and not question them. And there are many organizations which are like that. Bosses sometimes want it like that because they are responsible for project's success and want to have everything under control.

I guess it depends on the industry you work in, but I would say that majority of jobs are of repetitive nature, even high skilled work like software development. 
 
Automated systems are not free and require investments, and since labor cost is going down now, it doesn't have to mean that automated system will actually cost less. And even if we cut jobs by implementing automated systems everywhere, people will lose jobs and demand will fall.

&gt;""Sarkozy's view of the chancellor changed the more he came to understand Germany. I could really sense this change. At the beginning he said: ""She doesn't want to."" Now he says: ""She can't.""

Aus NASAs Sicht hilft es nach den fehlgeschlagenen Missionen der 90er unter der ""mehr aber billiger"" Doktrin wieder Vertrauen in groessere Projekte herzustellen.

NASA wird sicher auch interessiert sein daran sich gegen die Konkurrenz aus dem privaten Sektor zu etablieren. Auch wenn es sich sehr futuristisch anhoert, die Projekte die da am Anlaufen sind (und zum Teil schon erfolgreich laufen) werden frueher oder spaeter das All kommerziell nutzen und NASA will da einen Fuss in der Tuer haben.

Fuer die USA geht es hier weiter um die Vormachtstellung gegenueber anderen Laendern, hauptsaechlich in Asien.

Fuer Deutschland ist es interessant weil es auch hier hilft Wissenschaftler und Ingenioere in dem Bereich weiter auszubilden und Erfahrung sammeln zu lassen. Grade fuer so ein Hochtechnologieland ist das recht wichtig.

Erkenntnisse die aus der Planung und Entwicklung hervorgehen nutzen bei solchen Missionen auch immer dem privaten Sektor und damit auch uns. -&gt; Teflon etc.
Ich bin mir relativ sicher das nur schon durch die Mission wieder einige neue Entdeckungen gemacht wurden die auf die eine oder andere Art ihren Weg zum Verbraucher finden werden.

Das Geld was dafuer ausgegeben wird verschwindet ja auch nicht einfach, sondern bezahlt Gehaelter usw.

Und das alles gibt es fuer einen Preis den die USA, im Verhaeltniss, aus der Portokasse zahlen. Bisher liegt die Rechnung bei 2.5 Milliarden Dollar, ueber die bisherigen 8-10 Jahre Laufzeit sind das ca. 1$ pro Amerikaner und Jahr. ([Hier mal zur Visualisierung](http://demonocracy.info/infographics/usa/us_debt/us_debt.html) wieviel eine Milliarde ist im Vergleich zum Haushalt, den Schulden der US usw)

Und bis hierher ist das Ding immer noch auf der Erde.

Generell ist jede Mars Mission immer ein Zugewinn an Erfahrung er ermoeglicht es erst spaetere groessere Projekte zu starten. Das ist auch eine der Dinge auf die Reddit im Moment so abfaehrt, die Technik die hinter der Landung steht. 3 Satelliten zur Ueberwachung in das Zeitfenster von den 10 Minuten der Landung an die richtige Stelle um einen fremden Planeten zu bringen, die Landung selber so reibungslos ablaufen zu lassen und, am kritischsten aus meiner Sicht, mit dem Sky Crane eine schwebende Plattform dabei zum Einsatz zu bringen ist auf jeden Fall eine grosse Leistung der Entwickler. 

Mir als Programmierer waere da sicher bei der Planung als erstes durch den Kopf gegangen: ""Super, ich wuerde da aber gerne nochmal auf dem Echtsystem testen bevor wir Live gehen""

Was macht das Ding jetzt nachdem es gelandet ist? Ne Menge Sachen sind auf jeden Fall geplant. Wir wissen z.B. durch die Sateliten das es aktuell sehr sehr unwahrscheinlich ist, dass Leben auf dem Mars existiert. Wie du schon geschrieben hast gab es Missionen die versucht haben von aussen Wasser etc. unter der Oberflaeche zu finden. 

Als naechster Schritt, und dafuer muss man naeher ran, soll jetzt Curiosity genauer untersuchen ob es ueberhaupt auf dem Mars Leben gegeben hat, gegeben haben koennte oder halt eben auch nicht. Die Implikationen von solch einem Fund waeren immens, weshalb man auch ueber jeden Zweifel erhaben sein muss.

Daneben geht es weiter darum mehr ueber Mars herraus zu finden, woraus er genau besteht usw. Genauer halt, als man das vom Orbit aus machen kann. Auch diese Erkenntnisse werden dann wieder in spaetere Missionen einfliessen.

Und als letzter Punkt, Grundlagenforschung und die Dinge die man noch nicht weiss die man finden wird.
Mars hatte hier immer neue und unerwartete Erkenntnisse offenbart, wo also jetzt schon klar ist, dass hier neues kommt. Deshalb wurde auch nicht ein Geraet da rueber geschickt, sondern ein ganzes Labor.

Wir sind mit Curiosity nicht fertig mit dem Thema, sondern es ist einfach ein weiterer Schritt und einer der sehr knifflig war und potential hat wichtige Erkenntnisse ueber unser Sonnensystem und ggf. auch darueber hinaus zu bringen.",0,1344365904,null,0,false,0,c5pl7j2,t3_xtfq0,t1_c5pl7j2,t1_c5pf694,null,1429576923,3,false,de,t5_22i0,3

Anyway, the €60bn or so that we actually had to raise didn't come at the cost of our industry. We didn't have to raise taxes to get it, in fact investors seem to be quite happy when we let them lend us money; interest rates are extremely low whether you're the government or want to get a mortgage to buy a house.

Did you know that 70% of the prison population is made from immigrants? Do you know that because of this crime explosion the prison system is collapsing as it already 2.500 inmate over capacity? And what is the respnse to that? They have given orders to the judges not to imprison people for lighter charges and are also planning to release prisoners to make some room. How's that for a problem? Does the media show the fear in Greek people's eyes? Most of the businesses have introduced or increased security because of this previsously unkown crime rates. Do also know that Greek hospitals treat illegal immigrants for free? And I am not talking about emergencies. Emergencies have always to be treated no matter what. I am talking even about medical-tourism. Do you know that people from all over balkans come to Greek hospitals to get treated for free? How's that for racist? The cost of that? hundreds of millions.

I am not saying Greeks are better from other nations. But when you let 1.5 mil people that you cannot provide for they are gonna resort to crime. So in top of our local Greek criminals we have the illegal immigrants crime. If one checks the statistics it will be enough. And yes I am one of the victims of immigrant crime. My house was burgled during daytime. And I spend the everyday thanking my luck that no member of my family was present at the time as they might have been hurt. And yes, you can see it on the street very easily. People are always looking behind their backs even during daytime. This country hasn't ever seen so much crime. 

I do not know how much exposure had the incident in Europe but during the last days a 15yo girl is in a comma after being brutalized and raped by an illega immigrant. Before you answer me that it could have happened from a Greek criminal I am gonna answer you that IT DIDN'T. And after all if my chances of becoming a victim are 1%, it is much better than 2% with illegal immigrants.

&gt;How many foreign languages do you learn during 12 years of school (plus college)?

2 foreign languages. English, and German/Russian/French (this may have changed)


&gt;When do you start the first language? What about the second one (if it's the case)

Elementary school (8 grades), in my school it was German (other elementary schools had Russian or French) was the first foreign language from 3rd grade (age 10-11), and it was mandatory until 8th grade. English was introduced in 5th grade, and it was mandatory until 8th grade.

High school (4 grades), English was taught in all 4 years, but you could choose Russian/German/French but in my school there wasn't a regular teacher for these languages, so you had 45min. free time (and on the end of semester you had to take final exam)...

College(3 years), on my college English wasn't mandatory subject (and it was only one semester subject), and it was only language that you could take.


&gt;Which are the preferred languages?

English, German, Russian (back in my time).

Our waiter who was fairly young (18-19) was struggling with his English, which I thought was amazing as I thought those who speak flemish/dutch learned English by default.

Those in my grade were sufficient in Dutch (mostly through TV at that point. These days, internet helps as well, I assume).

Your waiter may not have been Flemish, for one, or he may have been good in French and Dutch but not English. Remember: most tourists at the Flemish coast speak Dutch or French.

&gt;Something else that really pissed me off in Belgium was that in the flemish Regions, menus at most restaurants were in fucking dutch. I mean, how many freaking people in the planet speak this language? So basically the waiters went around translating the menu and I was like, wouldn't it be easier to have the menu in English and then the waiter would save time with the translation? I had a friend that recently was in Belgium (maastrich?) and he said the same thing...menu was all in dutch, and he had to wait for the waitress to come around and translate the items in the menu, and this was in 2011. I understand if this happens in some unknown town, but for most touristy spots, it should be common sense to have a menu in English. :D

You have the option to study a second language mainly French at 14 but almost no does.

Edit - You can study other languages as part of your A levels (College) or as a degree, however you have to have done the language at school.
 
Edit- You are suppose to do a language from year 7 to year 9, but my school didn't.

**When do you start the first language? What about the second one (if it's the case)**

12
    

**Which are the preferred languages?**

French
German
Spanish

**Any other info regarding this subject you might find relevant (like facilities for minorities to learn their respective languages and so on)?**

Languages are going to be compulsory from a younger age soon.

true,flocosix,MOLD,Moldova,"Welp:

1. Depending on the high school profile that you choose when you finish 9th grade (you can either focus more on sciences or more on language/literature/history), it's either 2 or 3. In some schools, it can be up to 5 (or even 6, not sure), but that's already optional. The usual languages are: English, Russian, French, German and Latin. 

2. In grade 2 you start your first foreign language, most schools will offer as options only French and English (your parents choose). Some have German, but German is usually taken later on (it varies from school to school).

In grade 5 you start Russian. If you choose the science profile in HS, you stop learning it in 9th grade. If you choose languages, you will still have a lesson a week. (almost *everyone* speaks russian fluently anyway, these lessons are purely to teach you russian cursive, spelling, common errors, russian literature, there's no need for more lessons)

If you chose sciences, you just continue with 1 foreign language. If you chose the other profile, you will have to choose one more language to start learning. In total you will have lessons for at least 3 foreign languages, including Russian. Some schools teach mandatory Latin in HS, but there are absolutely no exams on it and it's generally rare. Some schools can give lessons on all available options - English, German, French, Italian and Latin - if you wish so. But that's rare too. Most stick with just English and French. 

* 3 - Almost always - English, French, German - in the order of popularity. Everyone will also have Russian for at least 4 years (90 minutes a week). I have also heard of Italian. 

* 4 - We have french-speaking schools here. French is almost as popular as English, the situation with it is the same as in Romania I guess. A lot of Russian schools as well, due to like 300k of Russians and 400k Ukrainians living here. Many of these just refuse to talk in Romanian (which is the official language), for which they are hated quite seriously and are treated with the same card - many natives will also refuse to talk in Russian. Both parts speak each other's languages fluently. Communication is problematic...

We also have many volunteers from Peace Corps and god knows where else, they usually teach English in villages for a year or two and leave.

Most (local) language teachers suck, and if you have had regular exposure to some language, chances are you know it better than your teacher. Unless it's a really prestigious school, no one takes language lessons seriously, and if you want to learn a language, you do it by yourself - or you hire someone - or you go to some courses. You can also approach the teacher and get homework and help individually - if he/she is kind enough for that.

true,Mordisquitos,null,null,"First of all, as Lucasterio said, if by ""next year"" you mean this September (2012), it's simply too late to enrol in a public university for an official degree. It might be possible to enrol in a private one (no idea), but be warned that they are much more expensive and generally considered worse than public ones.

Secondly, could you please specify what you mean by _""studying English""_? Do you mean studying English philology, literature and culture, as well as the language itself? In that case you should look at something like [Grado en Estudios Ingleses](http://www.ucm.es/pags.php?a=estudios&amp;d=muestragrado3&amp;idgr=4). If on the other hand what you want is simply to learn the English language, you are looking in the wrong place if you are looking at University degrees. What you'd want is a language school, such as the [Escuela Oficial de Idiomas](http://www.eoidiomas.com) (cheap but difficult to get a place), [The British Council](http://www.britishcouncil.org/spain/en/madrid) (probably expensive) or the [CSIM](http://www.ucm.es/info/idiomas/index.htm) (which is associated with the Complutense University and will prioritise its own students over external applicants for places). There are many others.

OK, now that's cleared up. Now, if you do want to start **next** year (September 2013) and you do actually want to study a degree in English literature, language, grammar, philology, etc there are a number of things you should get done beforehand (and knowing the speed of Spanish bureaucracy, start _now_). 

In Spain, students access University competitively depending 40% on their marks on a standardised three-day examination (_Selectividad_) and 60% on their marks in their last two years of high-school. That means that you must first of all validate your Danish (I'm assuming you're from Denmark) high-school grades and diploma via the UNED (a distance learning University) so that it can be converted to the Spanish system of marks. You can [find the information here](http://portal.uned.es/portal/page?_pageid=93,932663&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL).

After converting your high-school marks, you will need to enrol in the _Selectividad_ examination which will happen in June 2013. You can find some information on [this (non-official) website](http://www.consumer.es/web/es/educacion/universidad/2010/01/20/190564.php). If you need any more information on this matter, search Google for _Selectividad extranjeros_. 

Now, passing Selectividad isn't especially difficult if you have studied in a Spanish high-school. Getting a good mark can be difficult, but fortunately demand for _Grado en Estudios Ingleses_ or similar degrees isn't too high so you don't need an especially high mark. 

**However**, and this is a big, nasty, bold however: passing _Selectividad_ without having an extremely good level of Spanish and without having studied all the specific syllabus that will fall on the exams is virtually impossible. You will need to look up what modules are obligatory and chose what optional ones to examine yourself in, and study them **hard**, particularly as I'm assuming you have no background in ~~Spanish history, geography, language, grammar and literature . All those will likely be essential~~.(**edit**: _the subjects you will need to take will not necessarily be all the ones Spanish students need to take; thanks to Estre for pointing this out_).

I'm not trying to put you off, but you should almost certainly enrol in an _academia_ which will prepare you specifically for _Selectividad_. Also, have you got any Spanish friends who recently enrolled in University? Ask them about _Selectividad_, if they still have their high-school class notes and books, and if they can help you study.

Now, assuming you are willing to do what it takes to pass _Selectividad_ (and get a high enough grade to enrol in the course of your choice) there are three main options for studying English-related degrees. I would say they are all just as good as each other (there's no big difference in quality between large public Spanish universities). These are:

+ the [Universidad Complutense de Madrid](http://www.ucm.es) (or Complutense University). This is the largest university in Spain, one of the oldest, and it is close to the city centre. It can be accessed by Metro, city bus or even walking if you live close enough. This is their [Grado en Estudios Ingleses](http://portal.ucm.es/web/grados-facultad-de-filologia/grado-en-estudios-ingleses1).

+ the [Universidad Autónoma de Madrid](http://www.uam.es). This university is in northern outskirts of the city, but you can get there easily by commuter train. It has a nice campus. You can read about their [Grado en Estudios Ingleses here](http://www.uam.es/ss/Satellite/FilosofiayLetras/es/1242658506907/contenidoFinal/Grado_en_Estudios_Ingleses.htm).

+ the [Universidad de Alcalá de Henares](http://www.uah.es). This university is in [Alcalá de Henares](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcal%C3%A1_de_Henares), a small city in the eastern outskirts of Madrid whose centre has been declared a UNESCO world heritage and was the birthplace of Miguel de Cervantes. The university can also be accessed easily by commuter train. This is their [Grado en Estudios Ingleses](http://www.uah.es/estudios/grados/planes.asp?cd=106&amp;plan=G251&amp;T=ARTES_Y_HUMANIDADES).

Now, with regards to the cost: no, University is not free in Spain. Assuming you are Danish (and therefore a European citizen) you will pay the same as Spanish students. All public universities in Madrid cost the same: each year is 60 credits and each credit costs 21.32€. That means each year will probably cost you around 1300€ (including a few administrative costs). However, if you fail any module (which very common in Spanish universities, as the exams are usually tough) you will have one chance to pass it again in September, and if you don't you will need to repeat that module the next year and the price of that module will increase. The first time you repeat a module, each of its credits will cost you 37.90€; the second time, 71.06€; the fourth and any more times, 94.75€.

You might be able to get a discount or free tuition if you fall into any specific target groups such as having a numerous family or disabled siblings (paperwork necessary, might not apply if your family doesn't live in Spain), have a disability yourself or are a victim of terrorism. Also, assuming you are Danish, you have a right to the same student aids (_becas_) as Spanish students. This would warrant a whole new comment, so I'm not going to go into it in detail. If you live independently from your parents you almost certainly qualify, and you might be able to get free tuition and even a tiny stipend this way. Free tuition for students with a  _beca_ is generally dependant on them passing their exams, so be ready to study hard if you depend on the _beca_ to continue.

I hope I haven't scared you off enrolling in a Spanish University. It might sound daunting, but if it's what you really want, go for it! You will need to work hard, but it's most certainly doable.",0,1344377154,null,0,1344419569,0,c5pof2j,t3_xu1bt,t1_c5pof2j,t3_xu1bt,null,1429578440,7,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,7

1) Ear holes are reversible. If they are left unused, they usually heal by themselves. If not, they can easily be fixed surgically with no loss of use/sensation. This is not the case when the foreskin is removed. It can be reconstructed visually (though at much greater cost and risk than ear holes), but not in function. The sensation is permanently lost.

2) The penis is an erogenous zone. To most humans, this is a particularly private area. A human is much more likely to be upset that their penis has been altered than to be upset that their ear has a small hole in it which will probably heal with time anyway.

3) The penis is particularly sensitive to touch, especially compared to the ear.

In its most frequent modern usage, an ombudsman is an official, usually appointed by the government or by parliament but with a significant degree of independence, who is charged with representing the interests of the public by investigating and addressing complaints reported by individuals.
