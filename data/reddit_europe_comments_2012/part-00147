And do you seriously believe that legalizing weed would change that, if true?

On top of that, as long as the laws are what they are, then those people are criminals, as much as you may disagree with that. Besides, it's not like they shoot anyone just for having drugs.

true,donkey_lz,null,null,"&gt; Correct, though, I'm not quite sure what you mean by 'legitimate cultural preference'

At least in the part of the world where I live, most women simply aren't interested in engineering. It's not a matter of prejudice men have against women -- or, rather, not anymore -- it's simply that engineering is perceived as more of a ""men's thing"" and very few young women who graduate highschool are interested in career in engineering.

IMO, this is a legitimate cultural issue and it's not inherently good or bad, or something that has to be changed at every price.  This is no different than most men not being interested in becoming elementary school teachers. There's nothing stopping them from doing so, and some actually do so, it's just rarely seen.

&gt; That 'weinerfest biasing' reference sounds kind of gay. Is that a thing? Otherwise the argument does make sense.

No, no, it's not a thing, I was just referring to basic bias against hiring women.

&gt; One would, because of laziness, be tempted to ignore women candidates. Superior women candidate (to all available men candidates) would thus be dismissed out of hand. This would also create a hellish culture for capable women.

Who do you mean by ""they""? Because lets be realistic here - opinions on the EU are going to be pretty divided in the UK. You're going to have the Eurosceptics. Then you're going to have those who are Pro-EU. But the majority of the population is going to be made up of people who have little opinion on the matter, people who have never educated themselves on the benefits and costs of membership with the EU and may hold the uninformed opinion of whatever tabloid newspaper they've had a glance at.

To me all this opinion on the UK of ""just kick them out and wait for them to crawl back"" is both wrong and horrifying. In the same way that the poor Greek and Spanish people suffering from the recession aren't necessarily the ones who *caused* the recession the same would happen within the UK. *If* the UK couldn't manage without the EU it wouldn't be the ones who have been sparking up the anti-EU sentiment and rubbing the EU up the wrong way who suffer.

Mi spiego meglio: una volta concordato che è scritta da cani, il buon senso non può consistere nell'applicare alla lettera le regole della logica (per fare ciò non ti serve il buon senso, ti basta la conoscenza della logica).

Il buon senso consiste nel capire, come a me sembra ovvio, che la domanda voleva essere: *""Il rispetto della distanza di sicurezza va rispettato solo se si superano i 50 km/h""* e non *""Il rispetto della distanza di sicurezza non va rispettato se si superano i 50 km/h""*, perchè la seconda non ha alcun senso. In logica sono due espressioni ugualmente valide, ma in una situazione reale è chiaro che la seconda va contro il buon senso.

Tu mi dirai che la domanda dovrebbe essere ben formulata e che non dovrebbe esserti richiesto di applicare del buon senso per correggere l'errore di chi l'ha scritta. Ed hai ragione eh, non lo metto in dubbio, dico solo che se io mi trovassi questo quesito al test non lo sbaglierei.

true,GinoCY,CYPR,Cyprus,"The origin of the word is Hellenic. however even the term 'Hellinas' existed in ancient greece, not in later Roman Greece. The Eastern Roman empire and its citizens refered to themselves as 'Romei' and indeed Constantinople was often referred to as Rome. Many languages were spoken in the empire. Greek was the predominant language in the eastern roman empire and the main language of government. However people identified themselves through religion (ei. Christian, Muslim) In a document i read once when writing a paper, a Frenchman visiting Greece during the early Ottoman occupation deemed that the populous had lost their Hellenistic identity and none of the population even knew of the 'glory that was Greece"". Ancient Greek monuments near the village were a mystery to the villagers. In fact travelers needed multiple translators , some villages spoke a slavic/greek others spoke italian ,some a version of french and greek , an older form of albanian was spoken in villages in the Peloponnese. Greek was the most common language throughout the region , however even that had multiple dialect from village to village. 

The Orthodox church ruled the psyche and lives of the people. The Church was very much in favor of cooperating with the Ottomans because it meant that they controlled the christians living throughout the ottoman empire. A much larger and richer community for the Church to thrive in comparison to the dwindling powers of the church at the end of the Byzantine period. French and english nobles however were in love with the Ancient Greeks and the concept of ""Hellenes"". They , with the sizable greek diaspora living abroad in Italy , reinvented the concept of ""hellenes"" or ""Greeks"" and when the time was ripe (meaning the Ottoman Empire was in decline and targeted by western powers) , the majority of the Church backed this concept and helped create a new identity for the Christians under the Orthodox Church , a Greek national identity.

Every time they try to change something to better suit ther religion and culture, they are giving thousands of votes to the anti-islamic parties in Europe.

Eventually even those trying to be tolerant will get completely fed up and it will spill over. Then these parties will have enough votes to be a major player in the politics, which gives them the power to start deporting the immigrants and severely restricting immigration, leading to severe ""collateral"" damage in the form of moderate muslims getting punished.

This is not a battle they can win. And the more they try to fight, the further they are just pushing all the muslims towards the same cliff. It's sad to see the minority so utterly destroy for the majority.

The Orthodox Jews have had their courts open for years and their legal judgements are accepted by British judges. Despite Orthodox jews having rules that would be illegal in the UK. 

""Sharia courts"" aren't a precedent in the UK. The only difference is that the judgements these guys make aren't recognised legally in the UK in it always depends on what the people using these courts think.

If the UK government made a move against the religious courts of one specific religion and ignored others, then that would be an assault on that religion. If it was a defence of the UK judicial system then the bill has to act on ALL religions.

Personally, knowing the xenophobic crap that is the Daily Telegraph. I'm highly suspicous of the article and any ""facts"" it may contain.

""Sharia courts"" are at the end of the day arbitration tribunals. It has to be taken voluntarily. No one is physically forced to actually go and use these guys. If they are they have plenty of options in the UK to get justice served. 

I mean look at the crap in this article 

&gt; Another woman was forced to travel to Jordan to seek permission to remarry from a seven-year-old boy whom she had never met because she had no other male relatives, she said.

Was she bundled up and sent into the plane? Was she chained to her seat at all times? I've worked at an British airport. The only people who are forced into planes are people who are being deported or extradited.

&gt;Meanwhile Baroness Donaghy added: “The definition of mutuality is sometimes being stretched to such limits that a women is said to consent to a process when in practice, because of a language barrier, huge cultural or family pressure, ignorance of the law, a misplaced faith in the system or a threat of complete isolation, that mutuality is as consensual as rape.” 

Looking at this bit it's clear she's talking about women who migrate to the UK to marry. I'm sorry but if you come to the UK then it's your responsibility to learn how to live here. Learn the difference between a Crown Court and an arbitration tribunal. Learn the fucking language and grow a backbone. If people are pressuring you to do something you don't want to do. Then don't do it.

First off I've rarely seen golf used as a networking kind of thing in my industry. Secondly, women are just as capable of golfing or (more likely in the real world) going to the bar as men.

&gt;This is actually more difficult for women, since men often do networking in male-orientated situations like golf courses etc.

&gt;I don't know if I have made a very clear argument, but the point is that it may be a Catch 22 situation - in order to get more women into the boardroom we need more women in the boardroom. Maybe (or maybe not, I'm not convinced either way) the only way to do that is to have some affirmative action.

true,back-in-black,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; What is nonsense is these ""variable geometries"" marketing gimmick, because it would lead to more fragmentation. Sorry, the EU won't commit suicide because there are some nuts in Tory circles, using their media contacts to magnify some EU mistakes while hiding the benefits from their electorate. I'm not an EU apologist but I don't hide my head in the sand.

Well ""variable geometies"" is just me quoting what was said above. And as for fragmentation - what would you rather have, an EU with members who are leaving because of its single-mindedness and lack of flexibility, or an EU in which everyone stays and slowly comes to some kind of accord on what they collectively want the organisation to be. You can only pick one. 

&gt; The ""variable geometries"" is another polite way of saying ""we want to be in only if it's in our interest"". UK knows that it is isolated because of this shit, and tries to make it seem like there is a large bloc behind it, supporting the same. Newsflash: there isn't. A couple of disagreements from others don't mean a thing, things like that will be ironed out. EU always finds common ground.

As I noted above, an EU of more than one track would not just benefit the UK.

&gt; All EU members influence the EU. Educate yourself about the function of EU's institutions.

It should be painfully obvious to everyone, by now, that all is not equal in Europe. Some members have more say than other members. At the very least it should be obvious that those states in financial trouble have far less say than the ones that are relatively financially healthy. It should also be apparent that there is a strong case for some states to exit the Euro, and that this option has been kept out of reach for many of them. 

It should also be obvious that France and Germany are the primary policy makers in the EU, and that everyone else comes a distant second. Other states are bullied and cajoled into accepting what these two players want. The rules are not set up for the benefit of the majority, they are set up for the benefit of the most influential.

true,Feeling_Of_Knowing,ZBSVUE,U-E,"You have to answer a few questions to determine where you should go : 

- how much is your budget? For the same price : a 100m² house (with garden) in the creuse = 550/month. You can't even have a 15m² in Paris for this price! You want a house in a village, and there is a lot of difference between region. (Speaking of money, there is always socio-economic linked environment with a house. Think of it when you do your research, depending on your preference.)

- how good is your french? There is some region (Corse, Alsace, Provence, Nord, etc.) where the pronunciation is really particular, and it could make difficult the comprehension. Moreover, all regions are not the same when it concern the number of people who can understand english

- how much the weather is important for you? If you hate the cold, search in the south only. 

- when you say ""hikes and bike rides"", what kind of landscape do you prefer to see? 

Some recommendation : 

- There are some region where people are known for being generally more friendly : Provence, Nord... (compared to Corse and île de france for example). But you can't really generalize (there is a lot of wrong stereotype in France) : if there is always some beautiful welcoming village everywhere, the opposite is also true.

- some region are more ""green"" than other (generally Franche-comté, auverge, etc -&gt; beautiful walks in forest). Some regions have splendid mountain (so some beautiful hiking to do - like in Alpes, Massif central, Jura, Pyrenees or Vosges), some other have more fortified city, old castle, cultural site, or beach.  Depending on what do you prefer, you should choose your region. All region have its uniqueness.

- some village (generally small) are more rustic than other. The picture is appealing, nevertheless I don't recommend you to go in a very small village (where there is generally more farm animals than human) : it's sometimes difficult to find ""open"" people. 

=&gt; Try finding something intermediate : *at least* 1000 people, with a density of 50 to 100 people/km². Look at increasing density during the last few years, it's better for you and your kids (more young couple, parents, child, etc). Decreasing density are generally village where there is a lot of old people, and less and less shop/school/etc. 

Speaking of schools and shop : find a city where there is all you can need (M.D., school, baker, restaurant,...) ! The more the better.

* Strasbourg is the ""Europe capital city"" : You can go to Germany (in less than 30 minutes in bike!), Swiss (1h30 in train), Luxembourg (2h in car), Belgique (2h45 in car), 2h30 from Paris in TGV...

* the city is beautiful : the [petite france](http://thierry-poncet-photographies.e-monsite.com/medias/album/la-petite-france-a-strasbourg.jpg), the [cathedral](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Strasbourg_Cathedral.jpg), the [parlement europeen](http://www.cars-saintlaurent.com/dyn/courts_sejours/marches_noel_alsace/parlement_europeen_strasbourg.jpg), this is a [high school](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Strasbourg_Lyc%C3%A9e_int_pontonniers_01.jpg)...

People, you missed the point. Read what OP wrote again.

What is the issue we're discussing? The consequences of UK""s participation in the Schengen zone. Will this change the patterns of illegal immigration? **The UK will not be the first point of entry.** Britain is an island and the UK shares a land border only with the Republic of Ireland, which is also an island. Illegal immigration exists everywhere, and will continue to exist as long as there are humans in poor or war-torn countries. Participation in the Schengen zone won't change that. My point is that the number of illegal immigrants coming **from Europe** won't change. The authorities of the UK will still be able to look for illegal immigrants. Enough with that scaremongering.

Why haven't you implemented our tax system then- do you like to ignore human rights?

Probably, because you don not want to, you do not need to, and it is up to each individual country to decide that. Different taxes has nothing to do with human rights. 

I think the countries who want to implement the FTT certainly should be able to do that, it is not up to me to say what taxes they should or shouldn't have, just like it is not up to them to force the rest of the world to join in (which they haven't). 

Personally, I don't think it will succeed and I am glad we are not in it, but I think everyone has the right to try.

Saying that everyone who doesn't want to implement the same tax as you do though is racing to the bottom, is incorrect. When Sweden implemented it the 1980's  - were the rest of you racing to the bottom then?

So, then perhaps you should compare it to something else then, not implementing the same taxes as everyone else has absolutely nothing to do with human rights.


&gt;The argument I am actually making is this: This tax is a classic example of the stag hunt game. Not implementing a tax scheme like this is individually preferable to implementing it. However, the more countries implement it the better off we all are. Therefore, if we base our decision on the individual utility, we are missing an opportunity to make the lives of all of us better.


No, because  you are ignoring a lot of important, vital points. 

A) The tax is stupid, not even Tobin likes it. There are other ways to raise money.

B) We have tried the tax, it was a spectacular failure. (Swede here)

C) It is stupid to ignore what people have tried before you

D) If those countries (several of them at least) and the people in those countries actually cared about cooperation and implementation which you are implying through you stag hunt game comparison, I have a few questions for you:

* Why not start paying taxes to the levels that the Swedes/Danes/UK do for example - no more tax evasion, etc?  That is something that truly would prove social cooperation, trust and obedience

* Why not start to follow the Maastrich treaty ? No more trying to work around it. That would truly show to me that one cared about cooperation, the future safety etc.

* Why not follow the ECB rules? For a society, big and small to work, one has to be able to trust each other, and to be sure that everyone respect and follow rules and treaties. That is not being done at the moment, to put it mildly.

If you truly are interested in cooperation and trust, there is a lot to be done in the EU and I applaud you for that. However, adding another tax, doesn't hide the fact that the Eurozone is ignoring the rules at every turn, not fixing the problem and is basically built on sand. No amount of taxing can hide that.

And Paparigopoulos was the historian that invented the continuity of Greece and Greeks as  nation throughout history to strengthen that national identity (an idea that doesn't take into account the various communities and mixed populations that you are referring to, an idea that wants clear cut identities and ""pure"" races, as every other national idea). In fact Greece was the first created nation-state in the modern history of Europe. (By the way, [Mazower has written a nice article about how Greece was many times the forefront of change and experimentation in Europe](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/30/opinion/30mazower.html?_r=0), something that is also happening today with the crisis). In the wake of nationalism in Europe many people living in empires like the Ottoman one found themselves in a rather weird situation where they actually had to choose in which nation they belonged to, since many times it wasn't clear who was a Greek or a Bulgarian or a Serb because people could be from different or mixed origins but grew up learning for example Greek (which was the language of traders) or they could be speaking two or more languages.

This is also what is happening today with Macedonia (FYROM). It is a very new nation-state that is now undergoing the process of writing its national history and it bases that history on the history of the ancient Macedonian Kingdom. That is what many Greeks fail to understand because they think that they are actually ""stealing"" our history. But what the state and historians of FYROM are doing now, we Greeks have done more than a century ago, we have already constructed our national idea and connected our modern nation-state with a glorious past to legitimize our existence. Maybe we Greeks have stronger arguments for that since our language is indeed the ancient Greek language evolved, but for both nations, it is of course absurd to be claiming to be direct descendants of either ancient Greeks or ancient Macedonians - as is with every other national idea. 

However, despite that nationalism has been deconstructed decades now in the academic environment these ideas are not yet ready to be accepted by nation-states and the official education system of countries.

Well, they are both areas in which disputes arise. In any case, the article doesn't identify the types of disputes being resolved. In so far as the disputes are purely religious, the courts of England have no jurisdiction to pronounce on the religious validity of e.g. divorce (except in so far as the Church of England recognises the divorce jurisdiction of the ordinary courts).

&gt;  And as far as I can see, there's a bunch of regulation on how arbitration international trade law is to be conducted (codified in an international convention), 

Nope. The New York Convention pretty much only specifies that the arbitration agreement must be in writing, and that each party must have the opportunity to present a case.

&gt; Imho arbitration in family law pretty much defeats the purpose of having any family law in the first place.

In England, family disputes are not arbitrable.

Didn't Sweden kinda botch the experiment? You used a 0.5% tax rate in 1984 and doubled it in 1986 -- way too high. Also, why was the estimate so out of place? It was estimated that the tax will increase tax revenue by 1500 million kronor, but instead it only increased it by 50-80 million per year -- how can the calculations be so much off? Could it be imaginable that the financial world instituted an actual financial attack on Sweden because of the tax? If so, aren't they acting like terrorists and was dropping the tax an ultimate sign of weakness?

Would it be different if the tax were global and the opportunity to evade did not exist?

Probably not. As far as I know, in economics, just like in most of the social sciences you never get ""the perfect experiment"", since the world is not a lab, but it is very possible to draw pretty qualified conclusions from it, in my opinion. 

I certainly think they can implement whatever taxes they like, but not implementing a tax you do not need, nor want, does not make you evil. In fact, for us outside of it it is a win-win, but we didn't create this, we just were not willing to jump on the (in my point of view, crazy)FTT train.

Le programme de Romney est une réduction drastique du gouvernement et des impôts avec une exception pour le budget militaire qui augmenterait énormément. La plupart des économistes qui l'ont examiné ont dit que ce programme était totalement ubuesque dans ses prévisions. Ils disent qu'ils vont ramener les impôts sur le revenu à 20% max si je me souviens bien, et que ça va créer 12 millions d'emplois, mais ils ne disent pas par quel mécanisme ils imaginent que ça va fonctionner. 

Selon eux, dés que les Etats Unis auront un budget moins déséquilibré, les investisseurs vont se précipiter pour financer des entreprises américaines et créer des emplois selon une vague sans précédent.

Imagine un peu qu'en France on dise ""Bon, on va réduire la sécu, baisser les impôts et les financement des services publics et ça va créer de l'emploi.""

Les réductions envisagées dans le budget de l'état sont énormes. Tellement grosses en fait que en parallèle avec son augmentation du budget militaire, on voit pas trop ce qu'il va rester.

Linzertorte:

Ingredients:

* 3 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 tsp ground cinnamon
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 1/4 cups (2 1/2 sticks) butter, cut into pieces
* 1 1/2 cups sugar
* 1 pound nuts, finely ground (walnuts, pecans, and hazelnuts all work well)
* 1 egg, slightly beaten
* 1 egg yolk, slightly beaten
* 2 jars (12 oz each) raspberry jelly
* 1 egg yolk
* 1 tsp water

Directions:

1. Heat oven to 400 degrees. Place oven rack in lower third of oven.

2. Combine flour, cinnamon and salt in bowl. Cut in butter with pastry lender (or knife) until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in sugar and walnuts. Stir in whole egg and yolk. Work into large ball; halve - reserve one half for second Linzertorte.

3. Coat a springform pan with cooking spray (or butter). Press enough dough into bottom of pan so that it is covered, about 3/8 inch think.

4. Bake in 400 degree oven 12 to 15 minutes or until barely colored and remove from oven.

5. Meanwhile, roll remaining dough between sheets of waxed paper to 3/8 inch thickness. Put on baking sheet in freezer for 15 minutes.

6. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees. Reset rack in upper third of oven.

7. Spread jam over baked torte bottom.

8. Remove dough from freezer, and cut hearts from dough using a cookie cutter.

9. Arrange hearts around the edge of the torte (points facing inward) to form a crust; place additional hearts in a circle in the center of the torte (5-6, depending on the size of your springform pan).

10. Mix egg yolk and water. Brush over hearts.

11. Bake in 350 degree oven 35 minutes or until browned. Cool on rack.

12. Repeat steps 3-11 with second half of dough and additional jar of jam.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; The earliest known references to the islands as a group appeared in the writings of sea-farers from the ancient Greek colony of Massalia. The original records have been lost; however, later writings that quoted from the Massaliote Periplus (6th century BC) and Pytheas's On the Ocean (circa 325–320 BC) have survived. In the 1st century BC, Diodorus used the Latin form, Πρεττανία (Prettania) from Πρεττανική (Prettanike), Strabo used Βρεττανία (Brettania), and Marcian of Heraclea, in his Periplus maris exteri, used αἱ Πρεττανικαί νῆσοι (the Prettanic Isles) to refer to the islands. Historians today, though not in absolute agreement, largely agree that these Greek and Latin names were probably drawn from native Celtic-language names for the archipelago. Along these lines, the inhabits of the islands of Pretanike were called the Πρεττανοί (Priteni or Pretani). The shift from the ""P"" of Pretannia to the ""B"" of Britannia by the Romans occurred during the time of Julius Caesar.

Feel free to PM me if you want. 

This is a jumping off point – by the end of the semester you’ll be such an expert this list will look basic. Still – enjoy! 

**General Night Life**

*Las Cuevas de Sesamo* (In between Sevilla and Sol) – My favorite bar in Madrid. The sangria spot Hemingway went to. It’s in the basement, look for a vertical red sign that says ‘Sesamo.’ 10 Euro jarras, perfect for a weekday night when you want to go out, but just relax and talk not scream over music. It’s a bit more touristy than I’d ideally like, but you can’t deny the history and atmosphere. 
*Tip: In the words of the person who told me about it before I left for Madrid: “The spot to tell the girls “yo I know this little Sangria spot, you'll love it.” 

La Latina(La Latina) – Not a bar, but a neighborhood. Walk about 3 blocks down Plaza de la Cebada and then you’ll hit Calle Cava Baja. This area is great for bar hopping, there are a ton of tiny places all near each other, and it usually brings in a pretty diverse, no trace of America crowd.
* Tip: This is right where El Rastro(don’t worry, you’ll learn) is, and after that on Sundays this is where Madrid comes to end the weekend. In (I think) Plaza de la Paja, young Madrilenos grab some cervezas and literally just fill up the plaza relaxing. Definitely the place to go for Sunday Fundays. It’s probably good to stick with small groups here. 

El Doblon /Pirate Bar (Nuñez de Bilboa) – Walk in and you’ll know exactly why it’s the Pirate Bar. Cheap tequila shots, a bit pricey everything else, but a very fun spot if you go on the right night. It’s surprisingly large when they open it up. Not an every weekend place but you have to go at least once. 
* Tip: When they ‘open’ the full venue around 1AM on Saturdays, they have this whole show with fire and people swinging on ropes and it’s amazing. See if you can get a handkerchief (I have one, and it wasn’t easy.) 

O’Neill’s (Sol) – Irish Bar right near Sesamo where they don’t know Spanish, aka a spot to go when you’re homesick. Probably the best Irish bar in Madrid.
* Tip: Some of the BEST drinks deal in Madrid. On Wednesday’s, special shots(Jager bombs, Irish car bombs, lemon drops) are ONE EURO. You can get messed up here Wednesdays for like 5 Euros. 

Dubliners(Sol) – Another Irish bar. Has a lot of TVs, and lots of sports channels. They are used to Americans, so if you get enough people to come, they’ll put on a big football/sports game for you. 

**DISCOS**

Discotecas sound lame – overpriced drinks, techno music, and they’re called discos. I’ll admit I was anti-discos my first couple weeks there, I wanted to get the ‘real’ Madrid. The fact is discos are great, the girls will demand to go, and they're a big representation of Spanish culture.

Kapital(Atocha) – People will know about it. You’ll go. Maybe you’ll love it, maybe you won’t. I’m not gonna waste your time writing about it. Just know that this will be top of the list.
*Tip: Kapital is huge so they always try to lure people in. A ton of promoters are outside with blue cards – find these guys! If you get in by 1:30 with one of those cards, entry is 15 euros and includes 2 free copas. Otherwise it’s 20 euros and no free drinks (drinks cost about 15 a piece). Botellon before, and those two free drinks should carry you through the night. 

Joy(Sol) – This one is right in the heart of the city and always has a huge line. One big room usually accompanied by cheesy themes. Thursday nights are international night, which means a lot of Americans, but also a lot of Europeans and young Spaniards. The girls in my group loved it, I got sick of it, but it’s probably where you should go for your first disco experience. 

**AVOID**
Orange Café (Arguelles) – DON’T GO! This place is heavily promoted to Americans as a Wednesday night spot. It has beer pong and shitty drinking competitions and fuck it. 

**FOOD**
Cien Montaditos -  Bocadillio = little sandwich, and this place has a hundred different ones. Wednesday’s they have a great deal where everything they have – fries, sandwiches, 16. oz beers, are ONLY ONE EURO. Many times I got a afternoon snack and a bit of buzz here. It’s a chain, they are all over. There's one across the street from school. Ironically NOT a big American thing, which makes it ever cooler. 

Doner Kebab - Learn it. Live it. Love it. 

**GENERAL**
*Parque de Buen Retiro* (Retiro) – Like Kapital, literally no need for me to write about it other than to say that I have never felt more at peace then I have there – it’s where I spent my final hours in Madrid. One of the best things

El Buho (Night Bus) – The metro is great, but oddly closed from 2 to 6:30, the peak hours for coming home most nights. Most people took cabs, but those add up quick. For the patient and cheap I recommend the night bus. All busses run from Plaza de Cibeles, about 15 minutes from most nightlife spots, and then go out all over the city. They follow a schedule that’s worth learning to time when you leave, and are included in the cost of your metro pass. Unless you're in a hurry or far from Cibeles, don’t waste money on a cab – take El Buho.

Be nice to waiters, especially when you’re traveling. I can’t tell you how many times we got an after dinner drink /dessert gratis because we were young, friendly, not-asshole American students. Talk to the waiters like you do here and they will love you.

Finally,

Approach things like freshman year. It's amazing the crowd that Madrid brings in. Lots of good kids you would never have met, and lots of kids from other schools. I'm back home and I met my current girlfriend in the USAC Madrid program. The adventure just brings you together, so be open to that, and be open to whatever Europe throws at you.  

Finally, please know that I’m so pumped for you and hope you have a truly life-changing experience.


Salud!

&gt;When one's argument is ""So does the City of London"", the comparison to human rights and China is not incorrect.

OK, ""So does Sweden"". Could you please explain to me how the fact that China is ignoring human rights has to do with the fact that Sweden do not want, nor need, another tax, particularely not the FTT. Are we ignoring human rights too?

Honestly, reading through your questions- they almost seem mad to me, and I do not agree with your conclusions, but I'll try to organise them and answer them, one at a time.

&gt;Didn't Sweden kinda botch the experiment?

What were the rules that we supposedly didn't follow since we botched the experiment? Sweden wanted to increase the states income through taxes and introduced an FTT.

&gt;You used a 0.5% tax rate in 1984 and doubled it in 1986 -- way too high.

I agree, I think the FTT in itself is stupid, so any rate of the FTT is too high of course.If you ask me, no FTT

&gt;Also, why was the estimate so out of place? It was estimated that the tax will increase tax revenue by 1500 million kronor, but instead it only increased it by 50-80 million per year -- how can the calculations be so much off? 

I do not know exactly of course since I haven't seen the original calculations, but I know that they did not caclulate with the fact that 95 % of the trade that was taxed moved abroad. There simply wasn't anything left to tax. Also, they (as far as I can recall) didn't calculate with the fact that it was harming the growth.


&gt;Could it be imaginable that the financial world instituted an actual financial attack on Sweden because of the tax?

Well, this is where you lose me completely. Yes, it *could* be imagined that the financial world organised an attack on Sweden. Or, it *could* be the NWO (New World Order) who organised the attack of course (they are behind all the finances anyway). Or, it *could* be David Icke's lizzard people who organised the attack since it is well known that the lizzards do not like Sweden. 

However, I tend to go with [Ockhams's razor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor). I think the trade moved abroad since the companies could just as easily trade elsewhere, and the tax made it too expensive in Sweden. That to me is the most likely, and simplest explanation.

So no, I do not think the ""financial world"" (whatever you mean with that, are you including all finance minister and central banks too, I guess so, they are definately a big part of it)organised an attack on Sweden.

&gt;If so, aren't they acting like terrorists

First, could you define ""they"". 

Second, I do not think we were attacked in the first place

Third - no, I do not think that ""they"" are acting like terrorist.


&gt;was dropping the tax an ultimate sign of weaknes

Haha, you are fun. 

Well, I do not think that ""they"" attacked us, so I do not really consider Sweden during the 80's at war, or under attack. So no, again.

I consider the fact that the government dropped the FTT a wise decision since the tax obviously was doing a lot more harm than good.


&gt;Would it be different if the tax were global and the opportunity to evade did not exist?

Probably, if every single country on the earth implemented it yes. My question is  - why? If one do not need more tax revenue, why implement an impopular tax.

Or, are you saying that ""they"" are stopping it.

I am half convinced now that you are a troll, and a good one too.

Edit: I'd also like for you to explain ""their"" aim, and how they attacked Sweden? I find it very odd to attack someone by making the Swedish firm take their trade abroad. Are you saying they offered Swedish firms money if they moved? How was the attack organised, precisesly? What did they want to accomplish? Thanks.

&gt; Members of the law-school class of 2011 had little better than a 50-50 shot of landing a job as a lawyer within nine months of receiving a degree, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of new data that provides the most detailed picture yet of the grim market for law jobs.

&gt; The new details are likely to feed a debate about the value of a law degree. More than 40,000 students enter the law-job market annually. In the past year, law-school graduates have filed more than a dozen lawsuits around the country alleging that some schools misled students with job-placement statistics.

&gt; The 2011 data reinforce the notion in the industry that students from the top 14 U.S. law schools have little trouble finding work. The top-ranked schools sent graduates into long-term legal jobs in high numbers, but 87 lower-tier schools had placement rates of 50% or less.

http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304458604577486623469958142.html

&gt; As tuition has soared, so has student debt. Nearly 9 out of 10 graduates have sizable debt, with $98,500 the average for the class of 2010, or about $1,200 a month in loan payments over 10 years. Most schools and many students have banked on students’ being able to pay back enormous loans with ample salaries, but that flawed model is irretrievably broken.

Goldreserven sind immens wichtig, wenn es tatsächlich mal zu einem globalen Währungscrash kommen sollte und es hat schon seine Gründe, warum die FED im letzen Jahrhundert die weltweiten Goldreserven in ihren eigenen Kellern angehäuft hat.

The source of the popular sentiment has many factors, but I think it the biggest factor in its increase is unemployment.

Basically so many especially rural Hungarians are jobless or desperately hold on to a bad paying job knowing he is easy to replace that he will not accept when the liberal type of people (like the former SZDSZ party) that he is an oppressor and exploiter of the Roma and he as the majority society is responsible for their criminality and marginalization, when he himself is sliding gradually more and more into poverty and hanging on to existence with tooth and nail. It is something he will never buy when he himself is in desperate circumstances. A liberal can ""guilt-trip"" a comfortable middle-class happy person but not someone who is really struggling. He will be always like ""Fuck you, my car is falling apart, I live in a shitty old house with a leaking roof and even that is one paycheck away from being repossessed by the bank, so don't tell me I am responsible that the Roma have it even worse for if I benefitted from it, where the fuck is my benefit? I am poor, man, so leave me alone. And if they try stealing that little I have and threaten me to burn down my house if I report them, I gonna be very, very, very angry."" This is normally how poor people think all over the world, the difference is that the West does not have so many ""white"" people in so poor circumstances.

Meanwhile, there are many causes of Roman criminality but one obvious one is of course that there are no jobs. There are no jobs for even educated majority people, so why would there be jobs for uneducated Roma people? Even if you totally have no ethnic preferences, given that these days for example the dude I know who has a degree in film directing is packing boxes in some warehouse, would you hire someone who didn't even finish high school to the same job? Obviously not.

The whole thing will never be solved I think, but even toning it down will only happen when the country is literally swimming in jobs, so that companies have to compete even for the least desirable uneducated Roma workers, which will provide a strong incentive for them to work, which in turn will change the opinion of the majority of them.",0,1351155020,null,0,1351155229,0,c6rh4o8,t3_121zx0,t1_c6rh4o8,t3_121zx0,null,1430234460,18,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,18

Mais ce que j'essaie de dire, et escuse moi si je suis pas clair, c'est que dans un systèe libéral, les gens sont au courant de comment cela fonctionne. Les gens savent qu'ils ont un énorme pouvoir sur ces entreprises de part leur achat. Si ces entreprises ont des pratique immonde, alors, même si elle fait de bons produits, la faillite pourra pointer le bout de son nez car plus personne ne voudra soutenir de telles pratiques en achetant chez eux.

Pour le coup de microsoft, c'est exactement ça le problème, les clients de ce dernier aurait due manifester à microsoft leur mécontentement en disant qu'ils allaient acheter leurs logiciels ailleurs désormais. C'est comme pour toutes les pratiques honteuses de certaines entreprises. Pourquoi est ce que vous continuez à acheter des produits dans de telles entreprises si tout le monde, est d'accord pour dire que c'est dégeulasse. Mince je sais pas comment expliquer ça. 

Tu va me dire, oui mais et comment on fait si y a qu'une seule entreprise. (c'est bien la le débat depuis le début d'ailleurs). Et bien si les pratiques sont sufisament dégeux (oui j'aime ce mot), même si les personnes n'ont pas le choix d'achter chez eux, ils acheteront le moins possible et ce peu importe la pub faite derrière. Ils seront mal, et seront forcé de changer leur pratique au final, ou bien il ne changeront rien, et la concurence pourra quand même émmerger car la demande sera devenu absolument énorme, ce qui vaut bien un investissement.

Le rôle de l'Etat là-dedant ça a été de faire en sorte de faire ce qu ele marché aurait pu faire tout seul si un peu mieux éduqué. Mais en même temps, l'Etat n'a pas laisser le temps à la concurence de s'installer face à microsoft (je pense que linux aurait gagner de très grosse part de marché au final).

I sort of like this thing actually. The sad fact about human nature is that you can only form a community if it is defined ""against""something/someone  - not in the sense that it must be hostile to outsiders, but that it must _emphasize its difference from others_. 

I mean even our schoolteachers knew that the best way to motivate us to get better grades and help each other with the study like a good community should is to establish a healthy rivalry with another class, ""we will show we have better grades than them"", even they knew there is no ""we"" without a ""them"". But it does not have to be bad, hostile or stuff like that. We did not beat up the other school class, we just wanted to show we are smarter than them by getting better grades - is that a bad thing? Surely not.

This is why we usually don't have communities, because if you as a majority person define a we against a them, you will be called an extreme right-winger. And it is kind of true. We had way too much bloodshed out of an extreme sense of nationalism.

Still, I wonder how nice it could be to live in something like a Chinatown or a Little Italy (100 years ago in America) as an insider, where you feel that not only your apartment, but the street is ""yours"". You feel at home outside. You know the people on the street are having a sense of community with you. It is easy to chat with strangers because there is something in common. The corner shop - which has foodstuff imported from your home country - is not just a shop but a space for socializing.

Interesting that although we in Hungary fought hard against Ottoman expansion and at first they treated the conquered territories really harshly, as in, enslaving and selling abroad whole villages, later on it was actually kinda not that bad. For example they tolerated Protestantism, unlike the Habsburgs, because for them it did not really matter exactly what kind of an ""infidel"" you are. Ironically, despite the city and castle of Eger putting up a really strong defense and actually winning the first siege, after it fell in the second one they built a nice Turkish bath, still in use today but with more wellness facilities :-) and a minaret which is now used as a sight-tower for tourists. A bit narrow but you can climb up.  So I have the impression that it was not always that brutal.

Habsburg rule was actually many ways worse, so that later on the anti-Habsburg ""kuruc"" insurgents often allied with the Turkish. It said they even participated in the siege of Vienna.

The last hangings in the UK where in 1964, not that long ago. And as I'm sure you're well aware Capital Punishement is still in use in many countries, including the United States.

&gt; And this doesn't work the other way. The State sometimes commits crimes, does the State give up it's right to rule and make law? No.

Like I said when you're imprisoned here in the UK you loose most of your rights you would have as a free citizen, you are still entitled to basic rights and lets not forget by the very name 'prisoner' you are taking away most of the UK's common law human rights https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_the_United_Kingdom

I guess it all depends on what you mean by active.

Biking
For example if you like bikes, I pass by this place on my way to work everyday and it looks cool. http://www.cruisingbarcelona.com/english/ It's a bike rental / bike tour place with really nice cruising fat tyre bikes. 

Walking
If you want to go walking / explore a bit there's loads of things to do on Mont Juic, (http://tinyurl.com/cte488a) Between the Olympic statium, botanic gardens, and the castle at the top there's loads to see with great views of the city and the sea. 

Bodegas Bars

""In October that year, a teacher was lynched by a Roma mob in eastern Hungary, provoking nationwide outrage. Jobbik coined the term ""Roma crime"" and began to vilify the country's 700,000 Roma as free-loading, lazy, and criminal."" 

That sounds kinda harsh, but Roma mentality is indeed not supportive for education, or later on, work. There is really low percentage of Romas with finished high school, although it is now obligatory. Their parents and society just don't support them. I feel that every person has same rights, and I respect their culture, especially traditional music. But I must say, they just don't live sustainable. Cohesion between Croats and them worked pretty well at the past, playing music and doing some crafts, but with technological development and job specialization, their unwillingness to educate just came as factor of real segregation. Now, really few of them has jobs (official at least).

That can cause some troubles for other people living in same area. Suppose that you have to let your children to go to the class in which majority of students don't even now to speak official language. Would that affect their education?

Another problem in this days of crisis is attitude ""Look at them, they get welfare, and they never even worked. I worked 20 years, paying taxes, and what do I get from my government now, living at the edge of powerty?"" I hear similar questions too often, but what can I say to that?

true,Al_Gorithm,null,null,"Umm, HFT does the opposite --- it reduces volatility by increasing liquidity.  What definition of ""volatility"" are you using here?  Certainly not the standard definition relating to movement in stock prices!

EDIT: [citation](http://www.tradersmagazine.com/news/high-frequency-trading-benefits-105365-1.html?zkPrintable=true):

&gt; Other critics may agree that accelerating price discovery is useful, but they argue that high frequency traders cause an unhealthy increase in market volatility, ""whipsawing"" prices around to benefit themselves at the expense of investors.  These critics buttress this argument by pointing to the perceived increase in high frequency trading firms in the past year and assert that these new entrants can only profit by causing needless price swings and at the expense of long-term investors.

&gt; These critics don't have a leg to stand on.  The principal way that academics and market participants evaluate the relative rate at which a stock price moves up or down is through a concept known as volatility.  Higher volatility is associated with greater price movements and lower volatility would signal more stable prices.  No serious market observer disputes the claim that volatility would not be higher without the liquidity provided by high frequency traders.

&gt; The volatility reducing effect of high frequency trading was highlighted during the recent ban on short selling.  When all short sales in financial stocks were suddenly banned, high frequency traders either reduced or stopped trading the impacted financial stocks.  The result?  A substantial increase in volatility and spreads, increasing trading costs for all investors. 

&gt; The curbing of high frequency trading didn't stop the stock prices of those companies from continuing to plummet; in fact, the declines accelerated.  But when the short sale ban was rescinded and the high frequency trading volume fully returned, volatility and spreads improved meaningfully. 

&gt; Despite the experience with short sales, the critics continue, nevertheless, to assert that high frequency traders are adding damaging short-term volatility.  Using the shopping mall developer example, the critics assert that if the current value of the land is $20 per square foot but the developer was willing to pay $100 per square foot, that the high frequency trader would briefly push the price past fair value to $120 per square foot before it settled on the new fair value of $100. 

&gt; But this conclusion is not supported by the evidence.  In fact, the few studies that are based on data sets that enable a detailed analysis of high frequency trading activity relative to all other market participants (including one by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) found that high frequency traders actually lowered short-term volatility and that high frequency traders were more likely than the rest of the market to push stock prices towards fair value.

&gt; Further, like the other criticisms, this assertion can also be evaluated logically.  High frequency traders can only trade profitably when their trades push a stock price towards fair value.  If a stock price were truly ""overreacting"" to a large buy order or were otherwise needlessly pushed around by high frequency traders then another high frequency trader would detect this ""overreaction"" in the stock price and quickly push the price back down to fair value. 

&gt; As a result, any high frequency trading strategy that consistently pushed a stock price beyond its fair equilibrium price would, over time, lose money.  The overreaction argument fails to take into account that there are scores of high frequency traders aggressively competing to ensure stocks trade at their fair equilibrium price.  The main impact of the increase in high frequency trading firms is more competition, lower profit margins for high frequency traders, and lower transaction costs for investors.  In short, allegations that high frequency trading adds volatility are not supported by academic research or common sense.",0,1351167782,null,0,false,0,c6rii21,t3_1204ut,t1_c6rii21,t1_c6rhsfx,null,1430235192,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

For anyone interested this thesis '[Alcohol is a Drug](http://www2.potsdam.edu/hansondj/Controversies/1119724962.html)' by [David J. Hanson, Ph.D.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_J._Hanson) makes the assertion that

&gt; Their intent appears to be to stigmatize alcohol by associating it with illicit drugs. As Dr. William DeJong, director of a federally-funded center on alcohol and drug abuse emphasizes, “in modern usage, ‘drug’ has become shorthand for ‘illegal drug’ or ‘street drug.’ People still go to the ‘drug store,’ but they go there to buy ‘medications,’ not drugs.” 3

&gt; By equating alcoholic beverages with illegal street drugs, anti-alcohol activists attempt to create negative attitudes toward such beverages. That makes it easier to promote higher alcohol taxes, more stringent restrictions on the times and places alcohol can be sold, censorship of alcohol advertising, and similar policies to reduce alcohol consumption.

You do not see how insulting, and wrong this is? For example, Sweden has lost a lot of jobs to the Baltic states, since it is cheaper there. It does not mean, that the Baltic states are abusive or are ignoring human right, it just means, that due to a lot of reasons, they are cheaper. And, London, due to a million of reasons, get more trade than Paris - doesn't mean that they are abusive. Have you ever heard about the field called ""tax competitivness"". Just because countries competet with one another with taxes, it does *not* mean that one is abusive or ignoring human rights. What you is claiming is very,very insulting.

&gt;The hypothetical ""they"" I imagine to be a few big players in the financial world. 

Or, why not David Icke's lizzard people? Or, why not the Jews? You are claiming stuff without backing it up. Names please? The burden of proof is on you? Oh, and I do hope you understand that most of those who moved elsewhere were *Swedish*. So, it was a *Swedish* super conspiracy then, that no one, but you, have ever heard about. Do you really think that is the most likely explanation. Proof please. Otherwise, you can always blame the ""they"" of the world, instead of the most rational, logical solution - that the tax was wrong and to high. Why can that not be the case.

Also, what connections do you have since you seem to be the only person in the world who knows about this. As a Swede, I have never even heard about this madness that you are suggesting. 

&gt;They would do exactly what they did, i.e. move their business out of ""offending"" countries, in this case Sweden. You wouldn't need them all to actively do this, the rest would follow out of their personal financial interests.

Look at the numbers. If they continued to do their trade in Sweden, they lost money, compared to when they did it in London. It is financially common sense to move then, why can't you get that? Don't you understand that companies want to make a profit, there is no grand conspiracy. Why should they make less or loose money if they instead could choose to move.

Seriously, you are a super effective troll or one of the worst conspiracy theorist I have ever met. There was no conspiracy, the tax was just ineffective. Sorry, to burst your bubble, but neither ""they"", the Jews/lizzards/NWO are responsible for the bad outcome of the FTT, it was just a stupid tax.

Agnosticism is *by definition* the state of not knowing. You don't claim *gnosis* (knowledge) about anything. Agnostics are not deists or atheists, the just don't *know* if supreme beings exist. They listen to all arguments, but since there is no proof for anything, they claim that they are ignorant. I think it's the most honest scientific stance.

Listen to Neil deGrasse Tyson. I'm on the same boat.

true,rabbitlion,SWED,Sweden,"Tyson makes some very good points and I agree with most of what he says there. However, just like there are plenty of people who are christian but don't get into discussions about it daily, I think it's very possible to call yourself an atheist and still steering clear of the drama of anti-god activists. It would probably be more difficult for a man as famous as him though.

Myself, I kind of prefer Dawkins stance on agnosticism (from wikipedia):

&gt;According to Richard Dawkins, a distinction between agnosticism and atheism is unwieldy and depends on how close to zero we are willing to rate the probability of existence for any given god-like entity. Since in practice it is not worth contrasting a zero probability with one that is nearly indistinguishable from zero, he prefers to categorize himself as a ""de facto atheist"". He specifies his position by means of a scale of 1 to 7. On this scale, 1 indicates ""100 per cent probability of God."" A person ranking at 7 on the scale would be a person who says ""I know there is no God..."" Dawkins places himself at 6 on the scale, which he characterizes as ""I cannot know for certain but I think God is very improbable, and I live my life on the assumption that he is not there"", but leaning toward 7. About himself, Dawkins continues that ""I am agnostic only to the extent that I am agnostic about fairies at the bottom of the garden.""[47] Dawkins also identifies two categories of agnostics; Temporary Agnostics in Practice (TAPs), and Permanent Agnostics in Principle (PAPs). Dawkins considers temporary agnosticism an entirely reasonable position, but views permanent agnosticism as ""fence-sitting, intellectual cowardice.""[48]

Assigning a non-zero probability to the existence of god does not mean you have to be an agnostic instead of an atheist. This is what I'm talking about when I say that 90% of agnostics are actually atheists. People think that just because they are not willing to rule out the existence of god with absolute certainity they're agnostic, and I don't think that is true.",0,1351194881,null,0,false,0,c6rphq9,t3_1229f8,t1_c6rphq9,t1_c6rozel,null,1430238491,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

A lot of Italians don't like [Catholic] Church power over our Government, while it could probably seem from a foreign eye that the Church has no power over Italian Government, some of our politicians have a long lasting relationship with the Vatican and will basically do what the Church wants. That's why it's hard to legalize marijuana, gay marriage and why it was hard for us to get the right to divorce and abortions.

Also the Church still owns a lot of real estate in Italy and often they avoided paying taxes on them disguising commercial activities as non-profit (religious) activities.

Another big issue is that private schools (mostly Catholics here, often owned by the Church) over the decades gained more and more funding from the Government while public schools suffer for lack of money.  

So, you know, fuck the Vatican.

Edit:

Oh, I almost forgot the fact most hospitals are pretty much ruled by `Catholic maphia`: you see, in Italy a doctor can refuse to do abortions because of moral implications. The fact is most doctor choose not to do abortions because if you do them then you'll probably end up doing that exclusively, which is not exactly great or interesting from a scientific point of view. Practicing abortions can pretty much fuck up you career in the field.

When you take these figures in account, difference in contributions start to make sense.

Another thing to note is that custom and farm trade duties shouldn't be calculated as contributions from a member state, because imported goods and items seldom stay in the port country, but are then shipped all over the EU. For example Netherlands collected €2.58 billion in duties, compare this to France that collected only €2.09 and €4.6 of Germany. When looking at these figures, it somehow seems that Netherlands could be this giant transport hub for imports and exports.

true,eurocanard,GERM,Germany,"Semantics. Every significant news source - from the New York Times to FOX to BBC to The Sun, RT to Spiegel, is controlled by some economic interest. Even if you write your own blog, Wordpress or Blogspot could take it down for a TOS violation; even if you go to the lengths of hosting a website from your home, your ISP could theoretically dictate your content to you. They don't, however, because they choose not to. And, to some extent, you have to take it on good faith that they aren't controlling what content you see.

The same thing applies to Presseurop - the EC can, of course, threaten not to fund them if they publish anti-EU articles. That they don't means their writers have ""editorial independence,"" relatively speaking. True, it isn't ""complete,"" since they might have second thoughts about, say, translating an article entitled ""F*** the EU,"" but unless you have some lofty ""state of nature"" in mind, you probably can't find any instance of *totally* free speech. Thus, if it isn't the policy of management to actively control what's written, Presseurop isn't unreasonable in claiming that its writers have ""complete editorial independence,"" unless you're a stickler about the use of ""complete.""

Granted, Presseurop probably employs largely pro-EU writers, but it's not like a devout Eurosceptic would want to join an EC-funded news source anyway. Not to mention, Presseurop's articles are only translations of articles from European papers, so the only thing that could be controlled is whether or not an article is printed. And if it makes you feel any better (it probably won't) Presseurop also translated the *Zeit* article that this *Spiegel* article complained about.

La mia personale idea politica per l'Italia prevede la divisione del Paese in tre, nord centro e sud, non per questioni culturali, ma per questioni di scalabilità. Tre ""sottonazioni"" da 20 milioni di persone, ciascuna con problemi e necessità legislative diverse si amministrano meglio di una nazione da 60 milioni. Inoltre, renderebbe il politico più ""vicino a casa"", con conseguente migliore connessione politica-cittadino, e migliore controllo su chi è e cosa fa. In cima, un governo federale snellissimo con compito di controllo e armonizzazione. Abolizione delle province. Miglioramento delle regioni. Purtroppo, queste cose richiedono una revisione costituzionale, e dubito fortemente ci siano i numeri per farla.

Pourtant les deux problèmes sont très proches, entre la ghettoisation, le manque de repères autre que la religion ou de modèles, les problèmes d'accès à l'éducation et la ségrégation par classes sociales. En France l'Islam est souvent lié à ces questions, et on fait un amalgame entre les jeunes français d'origine algérienne qui sifflent la Marseillaise et les barbus qui enferment leurs femmes. Les uns se nourrissent probablement des autres... et honnêtement même en étant opposée fermement à la religion en général je comprends l'attrait que peut avoir la mosquée et l'Imam dans un monde qui semble totalement désordonné, et je comprends aussi que certains peuvent en vouloir à la société française (pour pleins de raisons, mais pas toujours les bonnes...)

Comme toujours le racisme et le communautarismes se développent sur des clichés, sur la simplification du problème et le rejet de la faute sur une catégorie entière de gens. Par exemple, le fait que la police ne répond que rarement aux plaintes des femmes musulmanes des cités est totalement occulté et pourtant c'est central pour comprendre l'isolation que certaines peuvent vivre! Ensuite la méconnaissance de l'histoire de l'immigration mmaghrébine et musulmane en France est patente dans ces débats : il y a des immigrés plus ou moins récents, qui sont venus pour différentes raisons... avec des bagages culturels complètement différents du coup.

Bref, s'informer sur ce qui se passe devrait être la première chose, pourtant tout le monde croit tout comprendre à propos de l'Islam parce qu'on en parle beaucoup, mais comme on en parle surtout pour dire n'importe quoi et tout mélanger c'est pas super productif.

Après il y a plein de gens qui veulent interdire ceci ou celà comme en Suisse où je vis pour ""leur montrer"" ou ""envoyer un message"" mais je ne comprends jamais comment ils veulent aller de A. interdire le nikkab à B. les barbus comprennent qu'il ne faut pas opprimer les femmes, parce que ça me paraît évident que ça sert à rien...

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt;  At first glance, the BIG would seem incredibly expensive, but when you factor in the savings you get from simplifying the welfare system, the end outcome is exactly the same or even lower.

In Germany, out of the €45bn for Hartz IV (""welfare benefits""), the bureaucratic overhead is in the order of €5bn (salaries, buildings etc.). You could argue about whether or not job training programs could be saved as well, in which case you could save another 6bn. Either way, even the full €45bn would pay for about €45/month/capita. You'd need at least €1000/month/capita, or about a trillion per year. I think it's fair to say that there's a bit of a hole in the financing of such a program.

There's another problem. Hartz IV is partially tied to local conditions. You'll have your rent taken care of (small ""appropriate"" apartment, 45m^2 for singles) no matter where you live. But if you had to pay for your rent in Munich or Frankfurt out of those €1000/month, you'd have a problem, especially if those who took a job could outbid you. The result would be that people who would have to rely on the basic income would be forced out of their communities, if they happened to live in a more expensive place.

agnosticism: belief in the unknowability (unobservable) of a god or gods

deism: belief in a non-interactive (unobservable) god or gods

theism: belief in a miraculous (observable) god or gods

and finally irreligion, which is a broad spectrum, but may commonly be interpreted as a disbelief in any systematic beliefs in a god or gods

I cannot be atheist without having the gift of supernatural faculties to observe the answer to that question, which, in itself, would prove the existence of a god or gods (which would be me). Consequently in no circumstance would I ever consider myself atheist, the idea seems patently ridiculous.

Paradoxically the observability of supernature by the natural world would, in itself, unify both, resulting in a kind of nonsensical recursion where we need to repeat the question.

Besides, if you're *inheriting* a few millions, you're probably already so wealthy that this doesn't change your lifestyle. And if it does, inheriting only half of it will have the same effect.

I'm not against wealth, I'm against *unreasonable* wealth and improper rewards for work. Inheriting doesn't involve any kind of work and having hundreds of millions isn't any more rewarding than having a maximum of five.

Maybe I'm just not rich enough to understand this, but I can't imagine how visionaries like Steve Jobs or those Google guys could say: ""Meh, we can't get any richer, let's stop whatever we put our hearts into for the last few years and watch TV for the rest of our lives.""

And most people aren't even rewarded according to the effect their inventions have on society.

I don't know what country you are from, and what kind of bloated welfare state you may have, it is quite possible that people in your country can actually survive today on welfare, and that is problem in itself, in my opinion. 

After the financial crises that hit my country, Lithuania in 2009 (which in part was caused by unreasonable monetary payments, subsidies and total waste of money on new welfare entitltments by the ruling party of social democrats), the new Conservative-Liberal coalition did the necessary overhaul of the welfare system. 

Currently, people who don't get employed in two months and take no jobs from labour exchange (minimum wage, no doubt ), lose free medical care and all social welfare payments. So, here's your stimulus to get employed in Lithuania. These labour reforms have helped immensly to reduce the welfare dependency, balanced our budget, and reduced unemployment in the country.
