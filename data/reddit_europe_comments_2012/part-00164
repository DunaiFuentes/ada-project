The latest one had 53% of people already wanting to leave and around 30% wanting to stay. The undecided and the pro-EU are outnumbered.

When it comes to parties I have no doubt that Cameron is going to have to allow a freedom for his MPs to choose. The Conservatives are a split between the Euroskeptic and the pro-Business. However Cameron isn't strong enough to control the Euroskeptics and the fear of UKIP stealing Tory voters is to big for him to force the tories in the Pro-EU camp. 

No doubt we'll have a Labour led Pro-EU advocate group with the Lib Dems and Tory membes against a Tory led Anti-EU group with the UKIP and nutters.

When you do your online registration at Sciences Po you will have the opportunity to apply for a temporary place in generic (non-Sciences-Po, Paris-wide) student housing called the Cité Université. Almost every other exchange student I knew at Sciences Po was staying there. You can stay there until the beginning of October while you look for a place. LOTS of people in the Cité will be looking for roommates, but another popular form of housing is the « chambre de service », small rooms on the top floors of buildings that used to be servants' chambers and are now rented out to students for cheap prices. They're like dorms, you have a single room to yourself with a communal bathroom. One of my best friends was renting a chambre de service in Saint-Germain-des-Près literally down the street from Sciences Po for €400 per month (which is frankly the very best price you can expect in Paris).

Your best bet is probably to stay at the Cité. Otherwise, the big problem is that to rent many apartments you need to have a French bank account... but to get a French bank account you need to have an address in France! So you can save yourself a LOT of trouble by booking at the Cité beforehand and then using that address to set up your bank account, mobile phone, transit pass, etc.

France and Sciences Po can be really bureaucratic and frustrating to deal with, but it's an amazing experience if you can do it. I had an awesome time and definitely recommend it! You can PM me if you have other questions, I'm back in Canada now and suffering from serious France withdrawal so I'm happy to answer them! :)",0,1353572081,null,0,false,0,c754lss,t3_13lbiz,t1_c754lss,t1_c753wai,null,1430471500,1,false,france,t5_2qhjz,1

However, to answer your question, this song is definitely a military song, and it is not very surprising that it can be linked to some extreme right organization.

In 1981, soon after the election of a left president in France, this song has been forbidden in the army, because a company sang it in front of a member of the government, to express its disapproval. In my mind, it shows that this song is not innocent.

The origin of the french version seems linked to the Swedish version, via a German translation. The french lyrics were created in Belgium, and are  not linked to the first two versions.

Frankly I think it's a good tactic for getting what they want, but a very annoying one that creates resentment in the other countries and instability in the markets.  
  
I think Germany may be the one misconstruing Europe, thinking they can play this game for as long as they want - Tables will turn. They have started turning in my opinion because everyone already knows Germany is playing this game, and this game is making the situation worse for everyone.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt; You seem to have a very schizophrenic attitude towards who or what should be setting the rules in Europe.

The difference is that the UK can influence how the EU budget is being spent, and the amount we're talking about is rather limited. Pooling assets without fiscal and political integration would mean the opposite, guaranteeing spending on the national level of other member states without having any influence over it, up to an unlimited amount.

I don't agree with Germany's position on the EU budget, either, it's little better than the British one. This budget will be spend on areas where we already have joint decision making, albeit an imperfect one. Political integration, with a more powerful European Parliament, would improve that decision making as well, btw.

&gt; If you want collective decision making within Europe, then fine. Like I said the other day, I look forward to you arguing that the European Parliament should be setting the agenda on how to proceed in Europe, and look forward to you endorsing their decision (which they inevitably will do) that austerity is a deadend policy and permanent wealth transfers from Northern Europe to the South are what is necessary to make things work.

The Euro was not established on optimal terms — not because politicians didn't want it at the time, but because national governments were afraid to commit themselves to the measures that would be required to keep it stable.

There's two arguments against the Euro, both of them voiced at different times, but by the same people (mainly UK, but Denmark too):

1. We don't want to give up ""fiscal sovereignty"" — we want to maintain the possibility of devaluing to increase exports. Of course, this is disingenious because European economies are already integrated, with or without the Euro, so when one country is in a crisis, so is everyone else, which would cause everybody to devalue at the same time, rendering all the efforts moot.

2. Without a shared fiscal policy, the Euro is bound to be unstable. This is completely true, but the reason we don't have a shared fiscal policy is that the very same people complaining about the lack of one are blocking it with the arguments listed in point 1.

So yes, Euroskeptics were ""right"", insofar as they fulfilled their own prophecy by blocking the measures that would prevent those prophecies from coming true.

Its influence would decline and it would be separated from its closest geographic and political allies in continental Europe. We need to see a Britain engaged with its European partners.

&gt; Herve Mariton: Playing with the idea of a referendum is dangerous - many people think they can speak about it, but what might happen is that the UK gets out without people realising what is happening, without all the consequences being totally analysed.

&gt; Emma Bonino: The UK is not the only EU country to strive for referendums on Europe or for powers to be repatriated from Brussels. It is certainly the most vocal and, by far, the most obstinate - to the point at times of being in complete denial of its national interests.

&gt; Ulf Sverdrup: The alternatives to formal membership for the UK are also difficult to imagine. 

&gt; Derk-Jan Eppink: Leaving the EU would not be good for the EU or the UK.

true,atheistmil,UKGB,United Kingdom,"I wouldn't say it is a victim mentality it's bourne more of frustration about the level of incompetence we see at the EU level. There are so many things wrong with the current EU (and Eurozone) that papering over the cracks seems insane to many British people, some of whom would not want to be part of any kind of EU and there are others like me who would grudgingly join an EU were it not so corrupt and crap.

The EU (and Eurozone) can barely even mange the few compentencies they have now and yet we're supposed to be over-joyed at the thought of yet more Europe? 

I can forgive Cameron et al the schadenfreude at seeing the Euro implode since it was blatently obvious to anyone who cared to look the whole thing was doomed from the start. Even its original architects said it should not go ahead as it currently has done. 

The old saying ""when in a hole stop digging"" should be reworked for the EU to be ""when in a hole get the machine diggers in and some dynamite and lets so how far down we can go. Hard hats on everyone"".

Coupled with this we see on the richest nations of the EU - France, getting an ego massage with the continuing idiocy of the half-yearly Strasbourg migration, I mean wtf seriously? Have we nothing better to drop EUR200million on? Coupled with generous CAP payments which are insanely protectionist and yet the UK is painted as the utter bastard for not backing down on the rebate.


Let's go one step further, the UK and many other Northern European countries tend to implement the laws as required and even go further by gold-plating the laws where our own legislation is already superior to that of the EU norm. Yet so many other countries (France, Spain, Greece and many others) take the utter piss. My personal favourite is the French exemption of Danone from takeover on ""national security"" grounds. 

So yes, we may be out of sync, but many in the UK area would be incredibly happy with a free trade area, free movement of people (incidentally, when Germany and France kept their borders closed in the early 2000s the UK let the Poles and other Eastern Europeans in), and lots of other areas where co-operation is in everyones interest.

Me refiero a todo este tema lingüístico y de que una familia hable su idioma entre sus miembros.

A mi personalmente no me molestaría que si una familia me acoge entre ellos hablasen su idioma. Es más, lo he vivido en mi propia piel, en Alemania. Me acogió una familia donde todos sabían inglés pero entre ellos hablaban

La chica del vídeo o cualquier otra persona que vaya a Catalunya puede igualmente aprender Español ya que la gran mayoría de los periódicos, televisión, cinema esta en Castellano, por no hablar de la gente en comercios y locales donde casi siempre se te dirigen en Español. 
Tal y como se puede ver, la chica no se la ve frustrada ni enfadada porqué le hablaran Catalán, le entró ganas de aprenderlo por alguna razón. **Tuvo la suerte** de que en la familia hablaran Catalán entre ellos y ahora, con la misma estancia para aprender Español ha aprendido Catalán, qué hay de malo?

The article points in the wrong direction. France has a lot of new towns but not all of them were failures.

The real inequality lays in the 'Grands Ensembles', which are huge housing complexes built in the 50's - 70's to host population boom (people leaving rural areas + immigrants). They were seen at first as symbols of progress as they offered appartments with all commodities (an inddor bathroom for example).

Yet the 'Grands Ensembles' were most of the times poorly located, far away from the city centers. Their architecture was inspired by Le Corbusier's Cité Radieuse but it was misinterpretated, resulting in spiritless buildings. And the buildings have huge maintenance costs that no one wants to pay, resulting in premature aging.

But the biggest failure of these housing developments is urban planning. It's debatable, but by separating pedestrian traffic and cars urbanists have created a feeling of insecurity. By avoiding traditionnal structures (straight streets for example) they made it harder for the people to identify themselves to neighborhoods. And walking as a pedestrian through deserted parkings dominated by tall buildings gives shrinks.

This article is a good read, but it never really addresses its thesis that France ""built inequality into its cities."" It deals more with the result.

Most of the New Towns were built during the unprecedented growth of the after-war period. After the second oil crisis in 1979, the economy began to stagnate and because of policy changes, these new towns--which were meant to be semi-autonomous utopias--slowly went from sought-after real estate to places to house all of the immigrants that France welcomed in during the glory years (but for whom there were no longer jobs).

One of the main problems is that in addition to being marginalized because of their background, the second- and third-generation immigrants growing up in these places are physically separated from society. People who do ""succeed"" tend to leave the towns like Val-de-Reuil for the bigger cities where the jobs are, creating a small-scale brain drain.

Brief introduction to Hungarian politics for those who have nightmares about dictatorship:

According to a poll from September, about the **half** of the voters would/could not vote for any parties; they either don't give a shit or would like to see the whole political elite in jail.

Mr Orban's centre-right party would get only **23%** of the votes. They won 2/3 majority for a reason in 2010 but then they managed to cause huge disappointment.

Even the modified electoral system - that favours the winner - wouldn't be able to save them if there was a popular party in the opposition.

But the opposition sucks:

The Socialist Party that led the country into economic disaster between 2002-2010, provoked violent street clashes, etc. has only **14%** (mostly old people). BTW their politics has nothing to do with socialism, not even leftist, they're just a bunch of ex-commie businessmen.

About **3%** goes to the miniature neocon party of the ex-commie ex-prime minister who left the Socialist Party after he realised he had screwed up everything big time.

**9%** of the voters supports the far-right Jobbik. Those guys are absolutely out of touch with reality, but because of their populist rhetoric many desperate people in the countryside see them as the only party that cares about their problems.

The centre-left green party, the LMP has about **4%**. Formed in 2009, probably they're the least rejected party but since the elections they have failed to address the voters and gather support.

And a few weeks ago, another recycled ex-prime minister made his comeback, organizing an opposition coalition named ""Together 2014"". The guy was prime minister for only a year, and basically just followed the IMF guidelines. However, he is a close friend of the former ex-commie prime minister and his alliance doesn't really have a program other than *""come together""*, *""we must end the dictatorship""* and *""everything will be better""*. Also, the parties of his coalition have diametrically opposing views on several issues.

Summa summarum, as **46%** of the voters has no preference at the moment and hates the whole system, anything could happen in two years.

No matter what happens, there is no way that climate change could get so bad that humans would die out. We will be sure to survive. But there will be much adaptation, such as having to change some of the areas of agriculture due to new rain and temperature patterns, and migration due to sea level rise.

However, we can't just keep on going with our emissions and shurg ""Well, future technology will save us"". I have no doubt that technology will help us, but we can't rely on that only. 

Even with advanced technolgy, it is better to act now than later. More people will be saved, less species will go extinct, we need to adapt less and so on. No matter what the cost of mitigating climate change may be, it will surely be cheaper than not doing anything about it.

So, climate change is a problem, but not the end of the world. However, it will be hard and expensive, and it would be better to avoid it, if we can.

Weil wir dank der Eurokrise praktisch uns praktisch kostenlos Geld leihen können und [die Zinslast auf einem historischen Tiefpunkt ist](http://wirtschaft.t-online.de/staatsverschuldung-zinslast-fuer-deutschland-auf-historischem-tiefstand/id_53178282/index). Stellenweise haben wir effektiv negative Zinsen zahlen müssen -- wir wurden dafür bezahlt, dass man uns Geld leihen darf.

Gleichzeitig sind die Verbindlichkeiten durch die Griechenland-Rettung nicht nur von privater in öffentliche Hand gewandert, wird sind im Bund mit 170 Milliarden dabei, wenn Griechenland demnächst dann doch noch einen Schuldenschnitt machen muss, weil es, wie jeder inklusive Merkel and Schäuble weiß, einfach nicht mehr in der Lage ist die Schulden zu bedienen.

Die Dreistigkeit ist wirklich unglaublich. Da stellt sich unsere Kanzlerin hin und fabuliert vom demnächst Neuschulden-freien Deutschland, während sie im Falle Griechenland Kosten von 400% der derzeitigen Nettoneuverschuldung pro Jahr verursacht (im schlimmsten Fall).

&gt; Wichtiger finde ich eigentlich noch, wie der Artikel versucht, die guten Arbeitsmarktzahlen klein zu reden. Die Arbeitslosigkeit in Deutschland ist aber nunmal so niedrig wie noch nie seit der Wiedervereinigung.

Weil die Wirtschaft trotz und wegen der Eurokrise boomt und ausserdem die Bevölkerung kleiner wird, es immer weniger Leute gibt, die Arbeit brauchen. Die Zahl der Arbeitsplätze ist nicht so stark gestiegen, wie es die Arbeitslosenstatistik suggeriert, sondern wesentlich schwächer.

1. [Le fascisme Italien n'est pas raciste](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascisme). Le racisme n'est pas une propriété du fascisme.  
&gt;Le fascisme, à la différence du nazisme, n'était pas raciste à l'origine. Il a adopté une législation raciste à partir de 1935 (interdiction des mariages entre colons et Africaines) et antisémite à partir de 1938 (Lois raciales fascistes), dans un contexte d'alliance avec l'Allemagne de Hitler. Encore ces lois d'exclusion étaient-elles moins dures et comportaient-elles beaucoup plus de dérogations que les lois antisémites de Hitler et de Pétain.

2. Tout fascisme est révolutionnaire, et donc la tendance néofasciste minoritaire du FN a disparu en 1978^[1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Front_(France\)). Au contraire, il est plutôt traditionaliste et conservateur.

""It was feared""... there is no evidence that this would ever be as fatal as the press and special interest opinions always try to portray it. As far as I can see it the main thing what happens is that some people would loose some of their money. duh! That's it.

&gt; When one bank fails, like Lehman in the U.S. did in 2008, it is catastrophic for everyone.

It wasn't catastrophic at all. Some rich people lost some money. Also people that were stupid enough to put their retirement into Lehman stocks. The whole incident was actually pretty good because it introduced a whole new healthy distrust in banks and rating agencies. (Lehman was rated AAA one day before it went bankrupt).

&gt; It's one of the only reasons Greece is being propped up. German banks own tons of Greek and other troubled nations debt. Were a crash/default to happen, they would instantly be insolvent. 

The main reason Greece is propped up is because some rich people would otherwise loose some money. Those rich people make the politics.

And it's projected to increase over £30bn in the next decades.

But it's widely considered that it might be possible to treat or even cure Dementia and Alzheimer's, so surely we should be spending huge amounts on finding a cure.  After all this is not just about financials, these are millions of people fading away as human beings. But even in financial terms we fail horribly, spending only £65m a year on research, about three hundred times less than what we spend managing the disease. From the limited data I managed to find, it seemed that continental European spending is even more meagre. This is a challenge we really have to rise to meet, and we need to do so now.

The point is, a ""Single Market Only"" option isn't available, if it were that's what we'd have signed up for and that only. Instead we're left on the outskirts by default, there's *no* desire by the British public to be involved in any kind of Federal Super State, not even a little bit. On the other hand the euro is the greatest conceivable method of compelling those countries within it into a federal super state. So we in the UK don't even have to move an inch from our current position and the rest of europe will move away from us. That's precisely what's happening right now. The conservatives hope we can somehow negotiate a deal where we effectively have ""single market only"" EU membership, leaving us relatively unconstrained in all other policy areas. UKIP probably thinks there isn't a cat in hells chance of that happening so we're better off just leaving although no doubt if there were such an option they'd take it.

In what world can the UK have influence over a bunch of countries which share the same currency, police each others budgets, perhaps have their own eurobonds e.t.c? It's patently ridiculous, we can't go telling them what to do and neither should we try. But while we're inside the EU that's precisely what we have to do and will keep doing, until they're so sick to death of us they'll tell us to get out.

Which is exactly what's happening. The British public aren't just eurosceptic, they're eurohostile (I stole that from Micheal Portillo on this week) any referendum put in front of them now will have an automatic vote against the EU. They don't want more europe, they want less of it, that is a fundamental unbridgeable difference between the UK and the rest of europe, we have *always* wanted something different from europe, namely *only* the single market.

Sauf que la CNIL a juste un pouvoir réactif, a très peu de moyens et que pour chaque base illégale qu'ils ferment, deux autres repoussent. De plus la CNIL suppose toujours que les différentes administrations respectent bien le cadre de la loi, ce qu'on a vu être de la pure théorie avec l'affaire Ali Soumaré. Des politiciens ont eu accès aux fichiers de la police sur leurs opposants et la pratique semble assez systématique.

Maintenant imagine, selon ton bord politique, que le gouvernement puisse savoir quel cadre PS ou UMP va prendre un verre en privé avec des militants d'autres partis. Ça te semblerait normal? Si toutes les infos sont publiques, d'accord, mais s'il existe une asymétrie de l'information, c'est très dangereux.

It's gratifying to see police disinclined to coddle criminals, and who are willing to provide them the disincentives they apparently require. 

Illegal protesters deserve to be beaten without mercy, and rational people recognize and support the simple justice of cause and effect. And the reverse is also true. People wishing to encourage *more criminal activities* will be 'dismayed' at any steps taken to actively reduce or prevent crime.

It's really a shame those who are anti-police and pro-lawlessness can't be provided with an experience of *actual lawlessness*, with the police only observing them being robbed, raped, and murdered. Perhaps some instructional commentary would make the experience more informative; *""Citizen! Notice how your attacker is slashing your hands and arms, oh, and now your face?

Sounds like someone forgot a government should exist for its people, by its people, dick.

Not for the comfort of the rich members of society, and international investment firms.

Spain is currently implementing austerity measures designed to make the rich richer and the poor poorer.  The people don't like this and are showing their discontent with public protest.

No one here is disagreeing with the police protecting people from being raped, robbed, and murdered.  It's just that you agree with protesters being beaten (and assumedly the drug war), and others do not.

Most of the CAP for example is paid out to farmers based on the amount they produce. So countries with large, efficient farms or very large farming sectors do best out of it. The more developed economies have the most efficient farms for obvious reasons. There's also geography and demography that plays a part, e.g. France has almost twice the amount of arable land per-person compared to the UK.

To be fair some parts of CAP are designated for regional development which mostly helps poorer countries (EAGF and EAFRD).

The Structural and Cohesion funds are far more directly aimed at poorer areas but it's still not perfect. The main rule being used is regional GDP, so areas that generate less income get the most projects (not for free though, they have to come up with some of the money themselves as a co-payment). To imagine how this might go wrong just think of a region with a single big, rich city but very poor areas around it. On the whole it's not a bad start though and definitely fairer than CAP spending.

On the general growth question, the poorer countries aren't just growing due to EU funding (the above mentioned co-payments are getting some poorer countries into a [lot of debt](http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2012/04/16/polands-infrastructure-spending-speed-bumps-ahead/#axzz2D2WWBpPd)). In most cases they are catching up lost time due to political problems (e.g. USSR) in the recent past and are pretty much guaranteed strong growth if they continue the path they are on.

Yeah, that (amongst other things, including serious institutional change) is why reform is needed.  Do I think that countries will act in their own collective best interests? Of course, and it is precisely for that reason that the UK (and others for that matter) should be looking to shape the EU, where possible in a way that best matches their need and wants.  This notion that it's federalism or bust is a daft one, it may well end up going that way, but that is not an excuse to not try to have an influence on shape and direction.

As to QMV, it isn't as though powers can be unilaterally (or collectively) imposed in any case and the situation isn't new, so I don't really see it as an immediate issue.  Not to mention that national parliaments have and will continue to be selective in what they do so again, it's not really relevant.  The EU is still a very, very long way off being anything close to a federal government and it certainly can't get there without agreement.

Yes, we know, America wants Britain enmeshed in the eu and the deeper the better. It must seem terribly convenient to have Britain as a trojan horse inside eu, advancing free market and common law values that coincide with America's own.

Sadly, we are not merely tool for American foreign policy and this function is starkly at odds with British reservations about ever-closer-union.

The fundamental problem is constitutional, not economic; where should power be be best exercised, and who is a legitimate actor to wield that power?

There is no British recognition of a European identity, no recognition of shared aims and expectations that might result in a common governance that is both representative and accountable to all. Thus it cannot be legitimate!

For examples where this money go - in my city (Lublin - 9th largest Polish city, 350 000 population, 100 000 university students each year) right now we finish airport (haven't had one before). We're also building ring road for the city(now transit to Ukraine goes right throught the center of the city), better road connection to Warsaw (right now the road to Warsaw is the most dangerous in the whole Poland, and one of the most crowded), and to border with Ukraine is in progress. Infrastructure investments in Eastern Poland from national budget was almost nonexistant in last 20 years so EU funds are crucial there.

We're also finishing huge theatre/cultural center for the whole region (the building was started 37 years ago, there were always more important things to do with money, finally it will be finished. For big academical center like Lublin I think cultural investments are justified.

Big money are also invested into renovation of old buildings (like Lublin Castle, Old City, the most important buildings).

We've already covered this point before.  If prices rise, consumer preferences change with them, as will the behaviour of the markets.  Further, without CAP cheap imports from Africa will decrease the price of food drastically across Europe.

true,SavannaJeff,AUST,Australia,"&gt;Most of the CAP for example is paid out to farmers based on the amount they produce. 

Well this is just plain wrong. Most of it is spent on either structural reform of the agricultural sector (for example, assisting farmers in converting from oversupplied agricultural produce like wine, to more competitive produce), environmental and sustainability projects, or payments DECOUPLED from production. These decoupled payments ensure during years of oversupply, producers dont go out of business to ensure food security, and also allow small farmers to have a decent standard of living.

&gt;On the general growth question, the poorer countries aren't just growing due to EU funding (the above mentioned co-payments are getting some poorer countries into a lot of debt[1] ). In most cases they are catching up lost time due to political problems (e.g. USSR) in the recent past and are pretty much guaranteed strong growth if they continue the path they are on.

I don't disagree with you here, exactly, but I've been through most of the former East in the last year and you'd be surprised how many projects have some kind of 'done with financial cooperation of the EU' and stating exactly how many tens of millions of euros have gone into that project.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"Think of it as an attempt to make sense of the British believe that, somehow, when a few decades from now international agreements are negotiated between a few very large blocks, the Chinese would make room in their schedule to hear the opinion of the UK's PM. Why would they take the UK's position into consideration when finding a compromise between the half dozen blocks that make up the vast majority of global population and economic activity is already difficult enough?

Take the CE mark, I'm sure there are several of those on items that are on your desk right now. The EU sets standards and regulations, manufacturers design their products according to those specs, and then have them certified by a single entity. Now, imagine the UK would write their own. If they think they can sell enough of their products, maybe they'd go through the British certification process if they believe it might incidentally conform to them, but they most certainly won't produce a special version for the UK market.  
Or take EU environmental regulations. Manufacturers have to take back electronic equipment sold in the EU and meet a recycling quota. This requires them to design products from which materials can be recovered, and set up procedures for collecting their products after they become obsolete. Now, if the UK would attempt something like this on its own, most manufacturers would probably decide that it's too much effort for such a small market, and decide to deal with it by simply not exporting to the UK. 

I've actually read a number of Brits bringing up the Commonwealth as an alternative block. The difference between the Commonwealth and the Empire is that, back in the day, India would have had to listen to London. This won't be the case in the Commonwealth of 2050 when Indian business interests are at stake, especially not since they will be large enough to see eye to eye with the other big players whether or not they have the rest of the Commonwealth to back them up.

That's where the Empire thing comes from.

All your points can be covered with what I feel like most Britons want - which is Free Trade with Europe whilst being able to govern ourselves.

The CE mark - Look at Switzerland - they sell to the EU just fine (conforming to CE regulations) and also import from the EU fine also. The advantage being they can *also* choose for themselves if something is fit for sale. Britain already has it's own mark, the Kitemark, that predates the CE, the difference being that it is optional and is then left for consumers to decide. 

The commonwealth as an alternative block is appealing because of the uniformity of ideals, as well as at this point in time the commonwealth being (AFAIK) in much better shape than the Eurozone. I don't think anyone is dreaming anything other than a bilateral agreement, however.

Finally - your point about the Chinese making room to talk to the Uk is basically moot (in trade terms) because the EU expressly forbids us and says it will do it on our behalf. The Swiss have done just fine and an agreement is in place.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt; All your points can be covered with what I feel like most Britons want - which is Free Trade with Europe whilst being able to govern ourselves.

Yes, that they want that is the impression I've got as well. Or rather, there seems to be a widespread misunderstanding about the nature of the economic cooperation between the EU, Switzerland as well as the other three EFTA states (together: the EEA). You talk about free trade, but they're even a part of the Single Market (as opposed to e.g., South Korea, with which we merely have free trade). Free trade just means that there are no tariffs on goods. The single market not just includes free movement of labor and capital, but also a common set of regulations (more or less, it's an ongoing process).  
Any product that confirms to the regulations can get a CE mark, if the manufacturer or importer gets it certified. You don't have to be in the EU for that, and of course British manufacturers could do that as well if they wanted to sell to the costumers within the EU. The point I was trying to make is that, as it is, a Chinese manufacturer can design to one set of specifications and, after a single certification process, can sell this product all over the EU and EFTA. If the UK would be on its own and came up with its own set of regulations, it's questionable whether all of them would bother to go through an extra certification process in the UK, especially not for low volume items, those with a small profit margin, or with expensive certification procedures such as for cars. And while they might take British regulations into consideration, they probably wouldn't adapt their design to them if that meant losing accordance with the regulations for the much larger markets in the EU or the US.

Of course, if there's a common set of regulations, there needs to be a process to agree on them. That's the overwhelming majority of things the EU does. Switzerland and the other three EFTA states aren't in the EU, so they don't get a vote on them, but they still have to implement those that touch the Single Market. These are many more than you might believe. Say I want to operate an online shop in Germany, to sell something made in Poland to customers all over the EU, and use a British payment processor. Right now I can do that, the Polish product is subject to the same regulations as are in place where my customers live, and I know that the British payment processor has to handle my customers' data in accordance with EU privacy regulations. If I wanted to use one in the US, I would have to make sure that it certified as covered by the [Safe Harbor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Safe_Harbor_Privacy_Principles) agreement that the EU has negotiated with the US. 

So, EFTA has to implement most of the EU regulations without having any meaningful influence on the process. Switzerland actually is a special case, because the agreements are bilateral and Switzerland reserves a right to opt out. However, there's the Guillotine Clause, which would cancels *all* of them if they did.

I would suggest that the UK rejoining EFTA to remain a part of the Single Market would be the way to resolve this mess, but I don't think being subject to Brussels' regulations without having a say in them is what Britons want, and as a German I actually like to have liberal market UK counterweight statist France.

Regarding the state of the Commonwealth, I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about a future where India will be globally much more important than the UK has been in decades. I just don't think the UK would be able to shape policy in a block with a then much more powerful India as well as it could as a major power within the EU.

Embauche massive dans la fonction publique sans augmentation du service rendu (hors hôpitaux, qui s'améliorent). Augmentation progressive des impôts et des 
transferts sociaux. Politique d'immigration peu restrictive qui a attiré des populations pauvres. Réduction du temps légal de travail (qui certes ne touche pas tout le monde). Baisse de l'exigence à l'école...

Qu'avons nous fait de similaire à nos voisins? Libre échangisme, monnaie commune, délégation de souveraineté vers l'europe.

Quelques contrastes frappants entre le passé et le présent:
audace napoléonienne vs ""principe de précaution"" et ""conservation des acquis"", liberté de penser des philosophes des lumières (jusqu'à la révolution 
française) et conformisme actuel. Guerres et paix.

Tea is a discussion topic, some little thing we have in common. But its not about how we see the world.

You talk to Indians about foreign policy, and what they care about is completely different to here. Talk to Nigerians of economics, or product standards or whatever and they will have completely different views. Talk to other Europeans and you will oft find much common ground, not far off as you would with your countrymen. 

I would agree that say, that Britain is more similar to New Zealand or Australia than a lot of Europe. Maybe even to the rapidly Americanising Canada. But Kenya? Pakistan? No.

You could not have a loose democratic Commonwealth free trade confederation. India would have at least 5 times the voting power of the UK. Nigeria would likewise have more. Countries which have little in common with you would be the ones in effect making decisions. Its not like Europe where the slight differences are offset by massive economic benefits.

That is the case.

Now if Finland would have won seat in the UN security council, the seat would have been useless, the country would have voted or abstained based on not making any power angry.

Maybe with bigger countries such as Germany, UK and France there is still a dream that their are influential, maybe, but in the 21th-century international politics will be dominated by super entities like the US and China. Nobody else comes close to their power.

&gt; Even the economic factors you mentioned are not certain- time and again centralisation has been heralded as a fantastic cost-cutting measure but has actually lead to inefficiency. 

Something are better done locally, but somethings are best centralized. It is eternal balance between the two.

&gt; Germany spoke out against the Iraq war, the UK was all for it (let's pretend that country= citizens for simplicity's sake). If there was only the EU representing both then one nation is being massively short-changed. Britain would consider the Commonwealth to be favourable trading partners, as would the French with the Francosphere. If the EU was one massive bloc then this would not be represented (or, if it was, we would simply be saying ""every nation is a preferred trading partner"" which makes little sense).

If the whole EU would have been using the Euro, there would have been single opinion that is don't invade Iraq. Why? Because Saddam started to trade oil with Euro, which was important economic milestone for the Eurozone. Unfortunately after the US invaded and occupied Iraq, oil is once again only traded with US dollars.

In case of Commonwealth and Francosphere, they are meaningless. China and the US are most important partners in all areas of life to the EU, all other countries and regions are dependent on relations on these two powers.",0,1353695403,null,0,false,0,c75olb4,t3_13o0x0,t1_c75olb4,t1_c75ofg8,null,1430481073,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

Openeurope is an obvious eurosceptic source, even in this very thread there are people debating the credibility of the statements in the links, but regardless, there's only one country that constantly threatens to veto and that seems to be eager in leaving.. it makes it much harder to support the British-proposed budget cuts when you try to act as the only sane person in the room and dismiss every other counter-proposal.

I do agree with Cameron's proposals of cutting the EU budget and I'd even go farther, CAP and the Strasbourg parliament need to go as they're too expensive, though it's quite obvious that France will veto anything of the sort, so the next best thing would be to make CAP optional so that member-states could opt out and make France alone the one to pay for the Strasbourg parliament (again, this is much easier said than done but it would be beneficial on the long run for Europe).

Regardless of this, I do hope that Britain won't alienate itself more from the EU, they can't continue to just opt out or veto, going in the reverse direction of the rest of Europe, these issues must be well discussed and a democratic outcome reached, not the usual ""either do what we want or do whatever and leave us out of it"" the UK seems to be doing.",0,1353695996,null,0,false,0,c75oq8g,t3_13o947,t1_c75oq8g,t3_13o947,null,1430481132,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

Ce que je voulais juste dire, c'est qu'il s'agit uniquement d'écrans de fumée purement symboliques. On parle du vote blanc qui ne sera pris en compte que de façon très symbolique. Pas d'une grande cause à défendre. C'est comme si on passait une loi pour comptabiliser le nombre de votants portant un haut-de-forme.

Après la promulgation de cette loi, le vote blanc sera toujours, au même titre que le vote nul, un sujet de dissertation pour politologues et soumis à de multiples interprétations sans aucun sens définitif donné, sans pouvoir de décision sur la Cité.

Si tu voulais parler uniquement du mariage pour tous : j'ai bien signalé qu'il était très important. Je suis pour. Le début de ta réponse est clairement à côté de la plaque, dans ce sens. Tu pourras d'ailleurs aller voir mes autres interventions où je soutiens les FEMEN.

Ce que je dis juste, c'est que de mettre au cœur des débats publics des sujets sociétaux fait sûrement partie d'une stratégie d'évitement de la part de nos élites. Il vaut mieux que le pays s'enflamme sur le mariage pour tous que sur des questions autrement plus cruciales...

Cette question du mariage pour tous aurait dû être voté en quelques jours. C'est ce que mérite le sujet : un passage rapide par l'Assemblée, le Sénat, et plouf, promulgation de la loi. Ce n'est pas comme si le gouvernement n'avait pas ses alliés ""sûrs"", à ce niveau (Hollande est le ""leader"" du parti ayant jamais cumulé autant de pouvoirs sous la Cinquième, à tous les échelons...). 

Les seuls sujets sur lesquels la majorité s'effrite (PLF, traité européen, habitat, Notre-Dame-des-Landes, sécurité...) sont ceux dont on parle le moins. Les sujets sur lesquels tout le monde est d'accord au sein des élus ayant le pouvoir (mariage pour tous, qui passera dans tous les cas, vote blanc comptabilisé...) sont ceux dont on parle le plus en comparaison de leur importance à l'échelle nationale.

Personnellement, je prends cette loi comme une façon d'oublier la promesse sur le non-cumul des postes.

The closest thing to a hipster district in term of bars is probably around [La Latina](http://goo.gl/maps/CAs3S) (generally pricey), [Lavapiés](http://goo.gl/maps/3AIS3) (more alternative/hippie) and [Huertas](http://goo.gl/maps/Vqbpj) (which is quite mainstream and popular with university students).

With regards to going camping, your best option is probably the [Sierra de Guadarrama](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_de_Guadarrama), which is part of the mountain range to the north-west of Madrid. It is easily accessible by train; just take the [Cercanías](http://www.renfe.com/EN/viajeros/cercanias/madrid/index.html) to [Cercedilla](http://goo.gl/maps/b9qr3) or [El Escorial](http://goo.gl/maps/2YKIf). It might take a while hiking to feel surrounded purely by nature, as the mountains near Madrid are relatively densely populated. Another place in the Sierra de Guadarrama that's worth going to and is slightly more remote (and not accessible by train, you must take the bus) is the area around [Rascafría](http://goo.gl/maps/S4hb9). Rascafría has some very popular [river-based swimming pools](http://www.rascafria.eu/Las_Presillas.html) that you might enjoy for a day out with a picnic.

The [Sierra de Gredos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_de_Gredos), which forms part of the same mountain range as Guadarrama, is to the west of Madrid and, in the areas furthest from the city, is a bit more rural. There you can go, for example, to [Arenas de San Pedro](http://goo.gl/maps/11g8C), another village with well known [river swimming pools](http://www.minube.com/rincon/piscinas-naturales-de-arenas-de-san-pedro-a80486). Finally, if you're into serious hiking, your best bet near Madrid are the hiking routes from the [Plataforma de Gredos](http://goo.gl/maps/r0qmw) (it's that loop in the road labelled AV-931). You can hike from the [Plataforma to the Laguna Grande](http://www.wikirutas.es/rutas/Castilla_y_Leon/avila/Sierra_de_Gredos/Plataforma_de_Gredos_Laguna_Grande_PR_AV_17_/) (what most people do), go [all the way to the Cinco Lagunas](http://www.hikr.org/tour/post3121.html) or even further. There is a [mountain cabin](http://www.refugioelola.com/) where you can spend the night next to the Laguna Grande if it's not full. Otherwise, most people pitch a tent in the area to spend the night which is allowed, but actual camping is strictly forbidden. Tents must go up around sundown and come down early in the morning.

**PS: Extra info.** If you want more general information on Madrid (transport, eating out, etc) take a look at [this earlier comment of mine](http://www.reddit.com/r/Madrid/comments/otnog/voy_a_madrid_para_estudiar_en_unas_meses_algien/c3k3rh0) (unfortunately it's mostly in Spanish, I don't know how much you will understand).

* Free enterprise, free and fair trade and competition, minimal regulation, lower taxation, and small government as the ultimate catalysts for individual freedom and personal and national prosperity.

* Freedom of the individual, more personal responsibility and greater democratic accountability.

* Sustainable, clean energy supply with an emphasis on energy security.

* The importance of the family as the bedrock of society.

* The sovereign integrity of the nation state, opposition to EU federalism and a renewed respect for true subsidiarity.

* The overriding value of the transatlantic security relationship in a revitalised NATO, and support for young democracies across Europe.

* Effectively controlled immigration and an end to abuse of asylum procedures.

* Efficient and modern public services and sensitivity to the needs of both rural and urban communities.

* An end to waste and excessive bureaucracy and a commitment to greater transparency and probity in the EU institutions and use of EU funds.

* Respect and equitable treatment for all EU countries, new and old, large and small.”

Das gleiche kann über das Internet gesagt werden. Bei der gleiche Logik sollten wir Staaten erlauben unsere Internet Historie zu wissen, unsere Telephone abzuhören ohne irgend eine Einschränkung oder Richter erlaubnis.

&gt;Klar, solange man irgendeinen Pass in der Bank zeigt (den seiner Kinder, oder einen frei gefälschten), ist alles Paletti. Und selbst falls Gadaffi seinen eigenen Namen benutzt, wird die nette Kantonalbank nichts über sein gestohlenes Geld sagen... 

Jeder Konto ist mit eine Identität hinterlegt (genau wie in JEDER bank in der Welt). Die Informationen benötigt um einen Nummerierteskonto zu erhalten sind eigentlich höher und Aufwendiger als was normale Konten brauchen.

Die Kantonalbank hat überhaupt nichts zu sagen ob sie das Vermögen von Gadaffi verhöffentlicht oder nicht (und wieder, in der Realität wurden alle diesen Konten seit Jahren eingefroren: http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/02/us-swiss-funds-idUSTRE7416I720110502).

December is often chilly, with the usual daily lows at around -2°C and daily maxs at 3 to 6°C. Snowfall does occur, but it heavily differs from year to year. ""Green christmas"", on another hand, is not so much of a unusual occurrance, although it's more likely to happen in the Western and Northern parts. My experience is that temperatures often drop between Christmas and NYE (at least that's what it's like where I am from). 

If I was a Texan traveling to Europe in Winter, I'd be looking for snow and not for *""Matschwetter""*, as we call it (which means temperatures below and above freezing point and changing rain and snow, which is what December in most larger German cities is like, unfortunately). Therefore, I'd suggest you make sure to have at least a week of snowy conditions. How about combining your Germany trip with a skiing vacation in Austria or Switzerland?  

But what are your plans, and how long do you plan on staying in Europe?
