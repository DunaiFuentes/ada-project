true,Whipfather,,Hessen,"""The Leipzig Games Convention, for example, was a flop.""

Bullshit. The main reasons why it was *""moved""* were the lack of hotel capacity, its far Eastern location, and some companies' influence (*coughcough* EA's HQs are in Cologne *coughcough*). The convention itself was a huge success, as evident by the ever-increasing numbers of visitors (more than 200,000 in 2008) and the fact that 90% of exhibiting companies wanted it to stay in Leipzig.

Slightly off-topic, but I get defensive about this shit. I went in 2005 and it was absolutely fantastic, and I'm still mad about the move to Cologne.

true,Dzukian,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt; It seems obvious to me that Mr Livingstone was attempting to point out - with some legitimacy - the hypocrisy in a previously oppressed people acting in an oppressive fashion. To chalk that down to just crude racism strikes me as an uncharitable and poorly judged decision.

This seems to me to be a highly unfair argument. We have no right to hold those who were previously oppressed to a higher moral standard. No one in Europe would act any differently if they were in the Israelis' shoes--and most would probably have behaved worse, given the Europeans' track records with colonialism. For countries who militarily subjugated and oppressed most of the world's population to wag their finger at Israel is just as hypocritical.

Pitching a wikipedia page was lazy of you. Why not just go with the honest answer and say, 'You know what, fair enough, the UK does tend to lead from the front when it comes to this regard.'

It wouldn't have killed the argument, it would just have been an honest concession.

Don't give me this piggybacking US nonsense either, you know it only applied to Blair-Bush.  Who brought the US to the former Yugoslavia?  The UK did, Clinton wanted out of it, and where was Europe then?  Being led by the UK is where.  Who has just told the US it can't have access to its airfields over Iran.  The UK.

We always piggy back the US?  Don't make me mention ze war!

&gt;Pointless to blame other European Countries who have men fighting with our own there on the front line.

That's the problem.  They all have different policies and they're doing little fighting.  One country doesn't like to fight at night, another will refuse to serve in certain regions because its dangerous, another country wants this, another country wants that.

Absolutely criticising them now has a point behind it.  Far from being 'pointless'  highlighting the shambles now stops a bigger mistake further down the line.  Treaties can work but a common force like ISAF is a farce.  It's amateur hour.  They all have different rules of engagement for a start so any common policy they would come up with is bound to be a compromise.  You know what you don't do when coming up with winning strategies in war?  Compromise, you just go for the right one, but with Europe the majority of it was a clusterfuck.  No apologies for the language.  It's appropriate in this case.

&gt;Haha. National interest,rather than ''charity''.  Ireland is our biggest single export market country in the EU,if I am not mistaken.

Regardless the point was that the UK stood in and showed leadership, which was the conversation.  Irish government didn't sort it out, the French government didn't do much or any of the Euro nations, it was the UK that moved first.

And yes, you are mistaken.  It's Germany.  Then France and then the  Netherlands, and then it's Ireland.

&gt;It is this fucking arrogance (excuse my language) that I hate about us.

Yeah, and clearly I was deliberately playing up to it so if you want to feign injury just go ahead.  Know what I hate about the pro-EU argument?  The people that make it are habitually dishonest when they go about it.  If the EU sceptical and anti-EU crowd's fault is that they ham up the arrogance to wind people up, and giving them what they expect, I'd take that every time over having to lie to make an argument.  Check this thread.  Any thread.  It's like Mos Eisley.

Don't think it's just the UK either.  Even in traditionally pro-EU countries in favour of more integration and where they have a big dream, when one looks at the few referendums there have been it's never blow away results of support.  It might be a minority, but it's a big minority whose numbers are bigger than any nation's population.  That spells trouble, big trouble years down the line.  It's not stable.  We're already seeing a rise in more separatist movements.

The most honest thing I've come across so far is someone from Finland admitting they have no interest in preserving or recognising democracy and public opinion in bringing in reforms, and it's either get in or get out.

The more you think of it, given that most EU referendums only poll around 50, 60%, and are often themselves dishonest being held again if they need a different outcome, that a strong UK scepticism is actually important and stands up for the many people in many countries who are having their voices hushed by appointed and aloof European bureaucrats.  The UK is the visible reminder of what it is they're sweeping under the carpet.

And people criticise the UK for not showing leadership?

This is the leadership, this is the UK stepping up, they just don't like what they're hearing.  The UK is saying the medicine Europe is taking, the path it is on, is bad voodoo.  ",0,1351553788,null,0,1351554291,0,c6tlh2j,t3_129mzg,t1_c6tlh2j,t1_c6tjn9p,null,1430271149,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Nope, but will for certain if Greece exits the Euro. Not an unimaginable scenario at this point.

The recently changed government style in the Weimar Republic might have caused a lack of support for the government. The widespread corruption and distrust of government officials in Greece could lead to the same lack of support.

Austerity measures look remarkably similar to the WW1 reparations in magnitude.

I don't think that Europeans should not speak up about oppression: they most definitely should. But when they do, it should *not* be a one-sided dismissal of Israel as being simply barbaric. Any European condemnation of colonial-like oppression needs to be accompanied with a thoughtful discussion on how the Europeans came to their present, ""enlightened"" state, without the colonizing and oppression of the past. It's not like Europeans just realized colonizing was bad and left: decolonization happened because the Europeans were too tired and poor, and the cost of retaining colonies too high, to maintain colonial rule. You don't get to claim a moral high ground for not having colonies or military rule because you're just too poor and weak to have them anymore.

Yes, because control of the Euro lies with the ECB, and the ECB doesn't answer to Germany.  No one country has control.  Countries that do have their own currencies are in control.  

It's as simple as that.

These kind of actions are not there in the groups you speak about, and in Europe most neonazi or fascist groups just stay in the rhetoric and if not the state makes sure they don't have criminal behavior. Don't underestimate the ease of fascism rising in a country during an economic and political crisis. History has taught us that. In 1967 all it needed was some colonels and a bunch of tanks (and of course the rest of the society either turning a blind eye, being afraid to speak, or thinking (like you) that all these are exaggerations). If the state was doing the job is supposed to be doing and actually arresting them for their crimes then maybe such a big fuss wouldn't have been made. What we see on the contrary is the state to turn a blind eye and that is what you should be asking and wondering about.

Seriously, I hope that you are the one who is correct and that me and other people are exaggerating.

Read the article. It's about Israel for the most part.

Me neither. We get absolutely nothing. Kosovo is filled with crime, drugs, weapons and all the other bad stuff, not to mention that their economy is practically non-existent. 

However I disagree about the part where you said that's it's not fair to govern people who wish to have no association with someone. This is good in theory, but how come the same rules do not apply to Basque, or to Abkhazia, or to Transnistria? Then again, if we do follow your rule, what will we do with the small number of Serbs living in the northern Kosovo?

true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"&gt;Wait, I thought we were talking about Libya?

I very clearly said treaties worked but common forces like ISAF was an unmitigated failure, and ISAF was only ever in Afghanistan.

Go back and look at that comment you responded to which you say you thought was about Libya.  Libya isn't mentioned once but Afghanistan by name is, as is the ISAF.

                     ""You can't talk about further integration and common defence policy and 
                                              afford not to look at ISAF.""

                      ""ISAF actually lead to innocents being killed and making the task harder.""

                     ""What's dickishness is when some soldiers were bleeding out in a German 
                         assigned region in the north of Afghanistan after being hit by an IED and 
                      where the command had to waste several hours on the phone persuading 
                      the local force that it was their job to provide medical assistance."" 

How exactly did you think that was about Libya?  I'm going to make what I think is a reasonably fair deduction.  You missed the reference to Afghanistan by name but when I was talking about ISAF you didn't know what it was but continued trying to argue.  

Incidentally that last one it was actually Canadian Development Agency workers which the soldiers refused to help - just to be thorough.  That's the level of breakdown, they were even arguing that they weren't there in a soldiering capacity more armed social workers and they were already deployed.  Something as simple as a chain of command ceased to exist.


&gt;Your brutish dismissal of anything ""European""

Not true.

Also not true.  

You're just outwardly lying now.  You come across someone that disagrees with you and you can't handle the topic so you simply accuse them of hating, dismissing everything European, and readily criticising other cultures.

&gt; a symptom of the frankly widespread delusional British common ignorance

The British ignorance that warned that this economic crisis was coming a long time ago and that has since been proven right?

Suck it up because you're in a cul-de-sac on that one and it's the Eurozone which is in crisis.

&gt;ISAF was a mistake for a variety of reasons — the primary reason being the fact that the Afghanistan War is impossible to win to begin with. There's no discernible enemy. 

You didn'tread any of the links, did you. The flaws specific to the nature of ISAF are laid bare.

&gt;It did not fail because of some inherent impossibility of European cooperation. The idea is completely absurd.

You didn't read the bit about NATOs own assessment in that there was a distinct lack of coordination and certain players where off doing their own thing and making their own mission statements?  That cooperation and coordination broke down.

You are so poorly informed it's an argument in itself against more integration and federalism.  It's a tragedy of the commons, a confederacy of dunces.  Giving more power to anything would be a huge mistake until it is fixed.

I can see why. The hipsters are only the second wave, the first to come are the creatives. Many are actually driven here to escape the hipsters in Berlin. You want space? For cheap? We got it. Rents may be moving upwards, but compared to even many much smaller cities, it's still cheap, especially unrenovated buildings further from the center. Hell, there are turn-of-the-century industrial buildings directly at the canal that are still boarded up and empty. There are many groups of people who move into houses that the average person wouldn't want to move into, and turn them into their own personal habitat. The scene around that can be hipster-ish, but those are people who are actually here to do something unconventional yet productive, and this wouldn't be possible almost anywhere else. What you get is a ""vibe"" of something happening. 

This is of course made possible by the still rather, shall we say, ""challenging"" local economy (although you wouldn't be able to tell if all you saw was the center, which is essentially a giant mall). But if you're young and don't have a family to feed, it's really quite attractive. And the old building substance is beautiful, it used to be a rich city throughout much of history.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Nope, but will for certain if Greece exits the Euro. Not an unimaginable scenario at this point.

It has not happened. Again, I don't know how much history you have read, but the situation in Germany was so bad with regards to the hyperinflation, that they still fear it, today, 80-90 years later. The fact that Greece *could* have a hyperinflation just does not cut it. Even if they had one, it would be more like Argentina, nothing like Germany in the 1920's. Please, read up on the situation there - [here](http://socioecohistory.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/weimar_germany_hyperinflation-1923_money_for_burningoven.jpg) is a picture to remind you abut the situation - has not happened. It is like comparing the yearly flu to the plague for God's sake.

&gt;The recently changed government style in the Weimar Republic might have caused a lack of support for the government. The widespread corruption and distrust of government officials in Greece could lead to the same lack of support.

So, you don't see the difference between just loosing a World War and having a few re-elections? Italy has re-election every second year for God's sake. Why not draw a parallell to them instead, it is much, much more likely comparison. 

Seriosuly, I honestly do not see you can compare these two. It is as if you do not understand war, and it's effects. The WWI was not some sort of cavallalry charge on autumn, of sending away robots from a cruise ship, it's effect was devestating and far reaching (and so bad, that they lead to WWII). 

To me it feels so strange, that you can compare loosing a few million young men, having 4 years of complete and devestating warfare, completely changing the way your country is ruled, trying out democracy for the absolutely first time (not to mention the Spanish flu on top of that) and the complet upheaval of society to Greece of  today. The Greeks are in recession and are not trusting its government - so? I can name 10 countries that have had that recently. It is like comparing the Greeks re-election to the Russian revolution. 

&gt;Austerity measures look remarkably similar to the WW1 reparations in magnitude.

I don't know how I can convey how devestating the Versaille treaty relly was. . Among historians, it is seen as one of the main reasons for WWII, since it laid the groundwork for a weak Weimar Republic, Hitler and so on. And, no, it was not similar to what is happening to Greece today.  Also, what you are suggsting is almost insulting, to the Eurozone, to IMF, to the EU, to  everybody. Over decades Greece have mismanaged its economy (and that is an understatement) chosen to ignore it in democratic elections and then ended up in the situation they are in. For years since their recession began, they have received bailout after bailout from among other things poorer countries (hello Estonia/Slovenia) their loans have been starting to be written off (already happened in March with some of the private lenders), they receive regularly dosis of money from the troijka, the IMF have put much less of a demand of them than they do on any other country (compare this with IMF acting in Latin America), etc, etc. I think a poor German in 1923 would have wished to be in the Greek situation of today, no doubt about that, at all. 

And, the fact is also that you are comparing the austerity measures with WWI reparations - Greece have always had a choice, haven't they? Apart from the fact that they have had decades not to take loans etc. They still have the ability to negotiate with the troijka (just got an extra two years) and they can choose to to default. Germany had none of that.  

&gt;Distrust in foreign powers (i.e. Germany) in Greece could easily lead to a similar sentiment.

Again, distrusting foreign powers- what country in recession doesn't? Argentina, Portugal, Spain, Estonia in 1999? Does that mean that that is similar to the Dolchstosslegend? No

&gt;Are you kidding? Have you seen Greek protests recently? An escalation is not out of the question yet.

Are you kidding? Have you read about the violent attempts to seize powers in the 1920's? How many thousands have been thrown in jail yet, how many have died, been murderd? Are you seriously comparing the *365* politicians assasinated to Sytagma square? [Link](http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/history/mwh/germany/weimarproblemsrev2.shtml). How many politicians have been assassinated in Greece? If you assassinate a few hundred, it gives you a whole new level of political instability.

&gt;I don't know why you can't see it, I've just explained it.

Yes, and I don't know how you can compare those to, I explain again and again. 

To me it is as if you are comparing the jailtime of the founders of Pirate Bay (two years in a Swedish jail) to what Nelson Mandela whas going through in apartheid South Africa. None of it might be right (I guess it depends on your view on downloading) but seiously, it is insulting to compare these people, to Nelson Mandela. 

I tell you again, and again how they are different but you insists that the fat that Greece *could* have a hyperinflation (not that it has) to a Weimar republic that has, the fact that people protest in Syntagma square to hundred of murded politicians etc. I honestly do not understand how you can do that, it is almost insulting. And, the support that Greece is getting to a Germany in 1923.......

I am not saying that Greece is having fun and perhaps things should be changed. But, comparing it to the Weimar Republic.. Why not the Spanish civil war or the sacking of Rome then? If we play that game I can compare it to the Russian revolution. Not that millions have died in Greece and they are not in the middle of a civil war, but in theory, it *could* happen.

Normalement non, mais la on parle d'une série de mesure qui mis bout a bout vise non pas a limité mais a supprimer l'immigration, ce qui est complétement différent en terme d’idéologie.

C'est pas mon avis, ça c'est juste le coté organisation politique, il y a plein de système avec un partie unique qui ne sont pas fasciste. De plus ils ne supportent certes pas un parti unique, mais ils considèrent comme illégitime tous les partis a leur gauches (""UMPS"" et au delà).  

Au final tu as grosso modo trois aspect a considérer: politique, économique et idéologique. Mon opinions, c'est qu'ils en remplissent un (l’idéologique) et pas les deux autres, et que ça suffit pour parler de partis proto-fasciste ou fascisant.

I have the same conversation with my friends and co-workers almost weekly. Here are the reasons I've heard and my common rebuttals:

**-Level competition for smaller businesses without employees**
There are other ways for smaller businesses to compete than staying open. They can offer different/better services. If this is really your goal then why not also limit the size of stores?

**-So employees aren't taken advantage of**
My German friends from the area strongly support these business hours and think that I'm crazy. A few also also assume that everywhere else in the world the people that work late night jobs are ""basically just slaves"" (their words, not mine) and don't do it by choice. My friends don't understand the concept of people working in shifts. I've worked odd hours before and I loved it. How do they justify allowing people to work in restaurants and gas stations then?

**-Religion (closed sundays)**
I am not religious why must I observe religious rest periods. I'm not allowed to go into work on a Sunday either, even if it's by choice. If I'm going to work overtime why am I forced to do it on the only day I can run errands.

**-Everyone on the same rhythm for resting and working** 
All this system has done to my life is cause stress since I'm always rushing to get to the store at the busiest times. All this does is create big waves of too busy and dead quiet.

And don't forget Maastricht in the Netherlands. 

To get around, familiarize yourself with the local public transport system. Even if your company pays for a rental car, you'll probably want to have a beer in the evenings. [Bahn](http://www.bahn.de/i/view/DEU/en/index.shtml) is the railway operator, you can search for connections on their site. There should be day-passes for when you want to take a trip to, say, Düsseldorf.  
You'll probably want to spend some of the weekends elsewhere. Hamburg, Berlin and Munich ([!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsches_Museum)) are all worth a trip, but also many other European cities. Neuss to Paris takes a little over four hours by train, and if you book a couple of weeks ahead, you can get train tickets for €50 or less (each way).

If your phone uses GSM (not CDMA as Verizon and Sprint use), it should work in Europe. Get a cheap prepaid SIM with a decent data plan for maps, translations, [public transport connections](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.schildbach.oeffi&amp;hl=en), Wikipedia and the like. I'd go with [Blau](http://www.blau.de/)'s ""9ct plan"" with a [mobile data](http://www.blau.de/tarife/9cent/internet-optionen) extra. T-mobile and Vodafone have a better network, but most of the time you'll be in a very densely populated area so it probably won't matter and their prepaid plans don't have any good data options. There are many store-branded resellers of Blau's plan, they work just as well. Best ask a local contact about what to choose and for help with registration on the provider's website.

Not every bus driver and supermarket cashier is fluent in English, but generally, you'll be able to manage without speaking German. As far as clothing is concerned, ""Winter is coming"". Compare [weather records](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=weather+neuss) to what you're familiar with so you know what to expect.

As far as cultural differences are concerned, read [this article](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13545386). It's focused on British compared to German communication styles but pretty much applies to the US as well. Don't overthink it, though. You'll be fine.

A job is a relation of dependency between employer and employee. The employer is dependent on me doing my job, while I'm am financially dependent on him. That's an important scale you have to keep in mind. As a high qualified engineer or whatever, I have no problems keeping the scale of dependency in balance. As low educated service worker (cleaning etc.), I'm basically replacable and more dependent on my employer than vice versa. It's easier to get somebody to work shitty shifts, if he needs the job and the money. I can't take a good economic situation for granted, so it's better to be prepared for high unemployment rates and negative social implications it brings with it.

At the moment, critical jobs that require 24/7 activity (health sector etc.) are working Sundays. With a nice bonus of course, because Sunday is not supposed to be a work day and your commitment to work on a holiday should be rewarded. Sunday and Holiday bonuses need to have the natural scarcity of labor available on those days in order to be considered.

Okay, let's say the Sunday protection is replaced by a maximum 6 day labor week. I get free time on Monday, the wife on Tuesday, my son on Wednesday, his wife on Thursday and my daughter on Friday. Family Reunion? Joint activities? Well, good luck with that. 

Chose another employer? Okay, now that's just naive. That only works if I'm wanted on the job market. Oh, you're old and don't have high education? Good luck finding a new job, that can offer you at least the benefits your old job offered you for the years you spent there.

&gt;**EU draft budget shows €50bn in cuts**
&gt;
&gt;By Joshua Chaffin in Brussels
&gt;
&gt;A fresh draft of the EU’s long-term budget has shaved €50bn from the original proposal, in a partial concession to the UK and other member states determined to contain the bloc’s spending.
&gt;
&gt;The draft, circulated late on Monday night, marked the first time that member states have specified hard figures in their EU budget proposal after more than a year of discussion. As such, it is a highly anticipated moment in the lead-up to a November 22 summit in Brussels when the EU’s 27 heads of government will try to reach a deal on one of their most contentious items of business.
&gt;
&gt;Cyprus, author of the new draft and which, as current holder of the EU’s rotating presidency, has the job of brokering a compromise among governments, called it “a starting point” and indicated that “more sizeable reductions are needed in order to reach a compromise”.
&gt;
&gt;The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, submitted its own proposal last year, calling for a seven-year budget for the period from 2014-2020 totalling €1.033tn – covering everything from farm subsidies to research and development, and infrastructure. The commission also called for at least €50bn in additional spending outside the formal budget.
&gt;
&gt;A group of member states, led by Germany, have been seeking a budget that amounts to 1 per cent of the bloc’s collective gross domestic product – or about €960bn – with all items included. The UK has sought an even bigger cut, calling for a real-terms freeze in the budget from 2011 levels.
&gt;
&gt;However, the commission gave a cold reception to the Cypriot draft, saying it was “not supported by the commission”. It added that the commission continued to stand by its own version, “which strikes the right responsible balance in times of crisis, both in the overall amount and in the balance between policies.
&gt;
&gt;The biggest effect of the slimmed down budget would be smaller pot of development funds that mostly benefit the EU’s poorer member states in central and eastern Europe.
&gt;
&gt;In their draft, the Cypriots took the biggest slice from so-called “cohesion” funds that aim to reduce economic disparities between poorer and wealthier regions, reducing them by 14 per cent from €379.24bn in the commission proposal to €326.49bn.
&gt;
&gt;The Cypriots also brought at least three spending programmes – for nuclear fusion, satellite navigation, and environmental monitoring – back into the formal budget, pegging them at just over €14bn.
&gt;
&gt;Agriculture, the biggest share of the EU budget, escaped largely unharmed. It was reduced from €386bn in the commission proposal to just over €378bn.
&gt;
&gt;Its staunchest defender, France, has argued that the commission proposal already reflected a reduction, and so should not be adjusted further.
&gt;
&gt;The EU’s administrative budget, which covers salaries, pensions and other perks for civil servants, “will have to be revised downward”, the Cypriots said, but did not yet provide figures.
&gt;
&gt;The long-term budget negotiation is traditionally one of the EU’s most contentious tasks. The current exercise is proving to be even more difficult because of the sharp divisions between net-contributors and net-recipients opened by the economic crisis.
&gt;
&gt;David Cameron, the UK prime minister, has argued that it is unacceptable to expect national governments to increase EU spending while they are forcing austerity cuts on their own citizens. He has won support – to varying degrees – from a group of wealthy northern and western European member states.
&gt;
&gt;At the same time, Poland and the new member states – with support from the commission and the European parliament – have defended EU spending as a way to stimulate much-needed growth.
&gt;
&gt;The commission has tried to fashion its own proposal, emphasising its many growth-enhancing features – often to critics’ dismay. One of its prized initiatives was a “connecting Europe” facility to fund cross-border infrastructure projects, such as roads and gas pipelines. The Cypriots cut it from €40bn to €36bn, with at least €7bn coming from cohesion funds.",0,1351592630,null,0,false,0,c6tsb58,t3_12bwvq,t1_c6tsb58,t1_c6ts1cr,null,1430274451,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

In the Israeli-Palestine conflict, its clear that the pro-Palestine direction of the left wing is due to anti-colonialism. Also I purposely wrote ""*like* to represent the poor"" to show Im not doing a value judgement

However, I disagree that this is the only reason why left wingers support Muslims (and not Islamists like the article wrongly claims) in Europe.

The attitude towards Muslims in Europe is not just due to the Palestine-Israeli conflict, especially in countries where there are very few Palestinians and Israelis. In France for example, the conflict is never a major voting issue between left and right.

The lefts program tend to be more attractive to muslim miniorities as they usually want- more social security, free healthcare, free education, facilitate getting nationality, less expulsions, allow more multiculturalism etc.

While on the other hand, conservatives traditionally- want more free market and less state help, preserve national identity, more police in low income areas etc.

**(Note im not making a judgement on who is ""right"" or ""wrong"", just caricaturing left and right to show why mulsims end up supporting the left)**

Aldelm's post is very interesting to see this. Even though many muslims are traditionally conservative, they end up being for the left because the left helps them practically and doesnt attack them.

Basically my point- 

Yes, the support for Palestine in the left in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict comes from the anti-colonial movement

However, thats not the only reason why Leftist Europeans are seen as supporting muslims. Leftists traditionally demand more state intervention for lower classes, and generally favour multiculturalism more than the right. These are areas which favour Muslim immigrants in Europe, even though they are traditionally more conservative. If Muslims in Europe end up voting for the left, its not because they support Palestine better, because frankly their positions are virtually the same as the right. Its because the left is more practical for a poor person comming from a foreign background.

Drugs aren't legalised, they're decriminalised.

The difference is that here if you're caught with drugs but they're less than 10 daily doses (as more than this and it can be considered trafficking which is still illegal), you won't go to jail but rather to counselling (which, AFAIK, you can refuse and simply don't show up).

Oh seriously? How Israel acts in the Palestinian territories bears little to no resemblance whatsoever to the Shoah. There are no mass shootings of innocents, no death factories, and no ghettoization (i.e. moving people from their homes into a tiny and overcrowded area). To say to the Israelis, who know that the Shoah saw 90% of European Jewry murdered in 6 years, that they are essentially perpetrating a second Shoah in the Palestinian territories (where the Palestinian population has grown by 300% in 60 years and has never seen a significant decline) is simply ludicrous and offensive. Moreover, the oppressive aspects of the Israeli occupation only appeared after the First Intifada. Prior to that, movement was not controlled, and Palestinians worked in Israel. It's obvious to anyone with even the slightest knowledge of the conflict that Israel is not just being arbitrarily oppressive out of hate, but acting in (potentially exaggerated) fear and in the interest of their own security.

Frankly, you're an idiot and an asshole if you compare Israel to the Nazis, because you would only do so if you had no idea of what the conflict is actually like and you're trying to send a message that serves no purpose than to demonize Israelis.

**After Dinner:**

A famous romantic place to take a stroll after dinner is the **Gianicolo hill**, expecially the part between Garibaldi statue in the main square and the [small lighthouse](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187791-d208560-Reviews-Colle_del_Gianicolo-Rome_Lazio.html) (yes there is a lightouse in the middle of Rome!), many couples go there and sit on the wall to cuddle admiring the view. 

Another place couples go take a walk is [**Isola Tiberina** banks](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187791-d246107-Reviews-Isola_Tiberina-Rome_Lazio.html).

There's also the latest trend youngsters started some years ago in [**Ponte Milvio**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponte_Milvio). Fuck Federico Moccia and his shitty book... anyway the trend is to buy a padlock, go onto Ponte Milvio (nothern Rome, near the stadium) the oldest bridge in Rome, be romantic, say whatever love promise you want, then secure the lock on the bridge and throw the key in the Tiber.

&gt; Dear Mr. Ambassador,

&gt; Thank you for the 3 bottles of wine that you sent me as season’s greetings. I wish to you, your family and everybody in the Embassy a happy new year. Good health and progress to you all.

&gt; Unhappily I noticed that the wine you have sent me has been produced in the Golan Heights. I have been taught since I was very young not to steal and not to accept products of theft. So I cannot possibly accept this gift and I must return it back to you.

&gt; Actions such as those of these days of the Israel military in Gaza remind the Greek people holocausts such as in Kalavrita or Doxato or Distomo and certainly in the ghetto of Warsaw.

When creating this I had to balance what was sufficient detail, and what was too much detail. I had to cut out around half the questions I originally asked as the test group said it was too long. Sorry that this particular section was not detailed enough for you. It's a tough balance to achieve, and I'm not a professional pollster, but a volunteer mod knocking something up in his lunchbreak.

&gt; There are millions of people who have to work on Sundays. From airports through hospitals to the light industry. Bakeries in Germany have to be up at 5 am on Sundays to deliver Brötchen when you get up to go to church, right? The idea that our world can just pause and go into stand-by is Utopia.

Then there is also a logical argument: to impose a day of rest is quite illiberal, to put it mildly like [kutuzof](http://www.reddit.com/user/kutuzof) does:

&gt; I'd rather my Saturdays be relaxing and get my shopping done on Sunday. If we both pay the same taxes why is it fair that the government decides that your lifestyle is ""correct"" and I need to adapt to live like that. We should both have equal freedom to shop and relax when we choose.

Then there are a lot of people that would be glad to work on Sunday, many students for example. And we already have examples of how it worked, according to [JayKayAu](http://www.reddit.com/user/JayKayAu):

&gt;Here in Australia, when Sunday trading was introduced, it made the place flourish with activity. Cafés, retail shops, and people bustling about. Absolutely fantastic.

&gt; And the people working on sundays (usually young adults/uni students) get time-and-a-half (1.5x normal hourly wage) which is kind of handy when they're at uni for the rest of the week.

&gt; Note that Sunday trading does not include most other businesses (e.g., tradespeople, factories, office workers, etc...), so if you have a normal 9-5 monday-friday job, you've got the day off.

&gt; It has been immensely successful and everyone is happy about it. Everyone - I have never, ever met a person who thinks we should remove Sunday trading.",0,1351602901,null,0,1351603581,0,c6ttkr8,t3_129tnc,t1_c6ttkr8,t1_c6ts88k,null,1430275043,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

A corporation is a money-making machine for shareholders and  not meant to be a humane institution or something for the social good  - that is the job of NGOs and the government and communal initiatives/fundraisers. One of these should step in and pay for this.

If you think the corporation iself has an ethical obligation to do non-profitable research, then, given that a corporation is just a proxy for shareholders, then you are basically saying that if you are as shareholder in say a brick factory it is OK to engage in pure profit-maximization but if it is a pharma company then it is somehow not OK. Which would be a very weird position. Why does a pharma shareholder need to be more charitable than a brick factory shareholder?

IMHO if and when there is a such a humanistic, charitable, social cause that cannot be reduced to the profit logic, **we all have to chip in somehow and not just expect the pharma shareholders should do it** and blame then and act surprised if they don't. This would me IMHO hypocritical. Why do they have to do more than we?

Taking this into consideration why are you even suprised? They don't need to whitewash it because it is a perfectly sensible and defensible and ethical thing.

Again, to be clear, I call it ethical, because the proper ethical analysis is not the shallow ""they let people die because of money"" but but the real ethical aspect is not expecting the shareholders of a specific company to do more about not letting people die than the shareholders of any other company or society at large, but expecting the whole of society to chip in somehow.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Bon, je vais proposer une analyse la plus neutre possible (je déteste les propos manichéens, et le bloc identitaire n'est pas plus détestable que l'émeutier d'Amiens ou le barbu intégriste de base).

Commençons par voir le contexte : 

Historiquement, la France a une tradition [assimilationniste](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assimilation_culturelle)
et [universaliste](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universalisme_r%C3%A9publicain).

Ces traditions sont intimement liées à la construction de la France en tant qu'état-nation par le catholicisme français (le terme catholique vient du grec ""universel"").

Elles ont été promues / imposées par le pouvoir, pour deux raisons:

1. lutter contre les innombrables [guerres civiles](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerre_civile) et révoltes internes en France
2. faciliter la centralisation du pouvoir (vision de Louis XIV)
3. favoriser l'égalité (vision républicaine)

Elles ont été nécessaires en raison de la diversité de la France :
diversité de peuples (gaulois / latins / germains / normands / bretons / basques ...) et donc de cultures, de [systèmes familiaux](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syst%C3%A8me_familial_selon_Emmanuel_Todd), 
donc de revendications et de rivalités.

Quand on est plein et différents, qui chacun revendique sa différence pour avoir des droits propres, ça finit malheureusement par se taper dessus.
L'universalisme (de Louis XIV et de la 3ème république) a donc été développé en France suite à des guerres civiles (la Fronde, puis la Commune).

Ces traditions sont menacées voire déjà enterrées par la démocratie d'opinion:

* le multiculturalisme démagogique d'état
* le [communautarisme](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communautarisme_\(sociologie\)) déjà en place

A cela s'ajoute une destruction du rôle de l'Etat, via la mondialisation et ""l'européisation"".

Venons en à nos amis du bloc identitaire. Les changements que je viens de citer ne leur plaisent pas, ils assistent impuissants à une dégradation de leur qualité de vie, et n'ont plus de repères (disparition des valeurs traditionnelles de la nation, de la famille, du travail et montée de l'individualisme, donc plus de raisons de se casser le cul).

Pour commencer on commence par se demander qui sont les responsables ?

* les communautés (non assimilées, par opposition aux italiens et espagnols qui ont été assimilés) revendiquant leurs droits à la différence (gays, musulmans, juifs ...)
* les pouvoirs qui ont laissé cela arriver : gauche antiraciste, droite libérale immigrationniste

Que proposent les principaux partis pour s'adapter à ces changements ?
Le déni (gauche) où la stigmatisation des immigrés, mais sans action concrète sur l'immigration (droite). Bref, du vent.

Le bloc identitaire propose une recette non nationaliste (donc assez éloignée du FN) du style  

""Puisqu'on est dans un pays communautaire voué à disparaître, autant y aller à fond et construire un communautarisme blanc chrétien à l'échelle européenne. L'échelon de pouvoir national étant perdu, reposons nous sur le modèle fédéral américain, avec un échelon de pouvoir régional.""

Pour fédérer un groupe et gagner de l'influence, le plus facile est de trouver un ennemi commun. Par exemple, pour le PS de la fin des années 80, c'était le raciste : l'expérience socialiste avait échoué, le prolétaire ne pouvait plus constituer la base de l'électorat socialiste, il fallait donc trouver une nouvelle base : les jeunes, les immigrés, et les profs. (Bien sûr je simplifie, mais c'est à peu près la stratégie électorale du PS époque SOS Racisme). En bonus, ça permettait de rapprocher la droite classique avec le FN, voire les nazis.

Compte tenu des données démographiques, le concurrent principal au niveau sociologique (c'est à dire à même niveau économique et à même niveau d'éducation) du bloc identitaire (des blancs ruraux ou périurbains, en général d'anciens prolétaires assez pauvres et peu éduqués) est l'immigré récent. D'où une islamophobie exacerbée.

Edit: In order to not simply look like an ass, history aside, please note that the letter actually raises a problem of international policy: *the Golan Heights are actually not Israeli territory*, and by ""actually not Israeli territory"" I don't mean that Arab countries don't recognize it because it was their land 1500 years ago, I mean it is actually not internationally recognized as Israeli territory. No member of the UN recognizes it as Israeli territory, and in fact the UN has formally condemned Israeli passing law to extend authority over it in resolution 497. 

Therefore, what the letter states is correct: Israel is indeed abusively exploiting the economic resources of the Golan heights, which according to international law is not part of its territory.

What the introduction fails to mention because, you know, it's an introduction, is that a good portion of the reason why the vote was rejected by the Syrians was that it came after an abusive occupation in the first place, extended over more than just the Golan heights.

After then 1948 war, there had been a demilitarized zone between Israel and Syria, which was thoroughly ignored by the Israeli forces, which gradually occupied, evicted and demolished Arab settlements in the area.  This was actually done as a state policy by Israel, who had a sure backing in the US in the form of the US, which constantly vetoed any attempt to even protest, let alone impose sanction, over human rights breach from Israel's side (countered by the Soviet Union, which did exactly the same thing but for the Arab countries); their hope (according to Moshe Dayan, then-minister of defense) was that instead of putting up with the rising civilian casualties and economic difficulties, and fearing open conflict with Israel, Syria would simply let them have the territories they wanted and be done with it.

However, this didn't quite work that way -- what happened was that, unable to find a UN-backed solution, pretty much everyone, including Israel and Syria, started to take matters into their own hands. The Syrians allowed and even encouraged terrorist activity; Israel rightfully replied to attacks over their civilians, which the Syrians escalated because their own attacks had been in response to attacks over Arab civilians. And things pretty much degenerated into sporadic fights, raids and eventually the sweep of wars in the late 1960s and the 1970s.

So when the Khartoum Resolution was passed, there was a fair current of opinion that was basically along the lines of Israel sure had a right to protect their territory against the Syrian shelling, *but* they actually started it (as a matter of state policy no less!) and a lot of territory was abusively occupied, not only the Golan Heights. Taking back the heights for a peace treaty legitimately seemed like a bad idea -- the peace of 1948 had not stopped military action, either, so there seemed to be little reason to believe that would be different in 1967.",0,1351610630,null,0,1351611646,0,c6tv9rn,t3_12c0zu,t1_c6tv9rn,t1_c6tux90,null,1430275905,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

* There was a anti-fascist motorcycle protest. They clashed with fascists. Police arrested 15 protesters. 
* The protesters claimed they were tortured in the hands of the police. [The Guardian published the story.](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/11744d/greek_antifascist_protesters_tortured_by_police/)
* The Minister of Public Order decries that these allegations are false and [threatens to sue The Guardian](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/11so2t/greek_public_order_minister_government_to_sue/).
* A medical report comes out that supports the claims made by the protesters. This medical report [has been shown to BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-20068145), among others. 
* Two journalists [comment on the issue on a morning show on state TV](http://youtu.be/MJ5jHzI47Ts), wondering if it is appropriate for the minister to resign or apologise for his statements.

The dialogue they exchanged that lead to their suspension:

&gt; Δεν έκανε μήνυση;

&gt; Δεν έκανε γιατί τα πορίσματα δείχνουν ότι όντως είναι κακούργημα.

&gt; Και θα παραιτηθεί τώρα;

&gt; Δε νομίζω ότι θα παραιτηθεί. Πάντως ήταν περίεργο το ότι ο κ. Δένδιας είπε – σαν να ήξερε τα πορίσματα, που αυτό κανονικά δε γίνεται - που από τη μία έιναι καλό ότι δεν τα ήξερε τα πορίσματα, αλλά από την άλλη πώς πας και το λες αυτό;

&gt; Και τώρα τι θα γίνει; Θα πει συγνώμη;

&gt; Δεν ξέρω….

&gt; Πω πω δύσκολα για τον κ. Δένδια. Και είναι και κοντοχωριανός σου, είναι από την Κέρκυρα.

Translation:

&gt; So, he didn't sue after all?

&gt; No, he didn't, because the medical report showed that [the treatment by the police] was indeed a felony.

&gt; And will he resign now?

&gt; I don't think he will resign. Anyway, it was weird that Mr. Dendias talked about the reports as if he had access to them, which is normally not allowed. So, on one hand it is a good thing that he indeed didn't have access to the reports beforehand; on the other hand, how could he make statements like the ones he made.

&gt; And what happens now? Will he apologise? 

&gt; I don't know...

&gt; Seems like Mr. Dendias is stuck in a tough situation. By the way, he's from Kerkyra, just like you.

you need to understand that there aren't enough working hands to collect crops, and farmers will give an option to collect X kilo of products and anything above that will be yours, in cases of Hadar crops you are allowed (and encouraged) to come with baskets and take as much as you wish (no trucks allowed) because they cann't collect all productions.

Other places will take any worker no matter he has or does not have experience in farming.

Fun fact not many Israelis work at farms because that is hard work and it the pay is low (best case scrinario  you would get 250 nis for a work day or sometimes you would get minimum wage).

As for the article, yes development aid often goes to shady people. That is a fact of life, what governments try and work out, is whether the benefits outweigh the costs. On a purely instrumental basis you can say that the British govt. thinks that improving the standards of living will prevent terrorism by this much vs the damage done by some of the money going to terrorist's in prison.

Other horrible things aid money goes towards; Food to North Korea helps stabilise the government and lets them torture their citizens more. Military sales to Saudi Arabia entrench a widely hated government. EU development aid to the Balkans was siphoned of by criminal groups involved in drugs and forced prostitution. Stability funds in Rwanda have helped a (stable) dictator come to power. Economic aid often causes violence as groups fight over profits.

&gt;Annual aid packages for Israel have held steady in the $2-3 billion range since 1974, although the breakdown of the packages has changed. When the level was first set, the package was pretty evenly split between grants and loans. Military assistance, known as Foreign Military Financing (FMF), slightly exceeded economic aid, known as Economic Support Funds (ESF). In 1981, Israel began receiving its full economic aid in grants, and four years later, all its military assistance became grants as well. By 1987, the amount of military and economic assistance—$1.8 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively—was at the level at which it would remain for 12 years. 

Loan guarantees do have an economic cost btw as they lower the receivers cost of borrowing relative to the giver as that debt is taken into consideration for sovereign debt interest rates.

I also found the explanation about [FMF](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/US-Israel/FMF2000.html) but I would be happy to be corrected.

*Foreign Military Financing (FMF) provides grants for the acquisition of U.S. defense equipment, services, and training. It is intended to promote U.S. national security by contributing to regional and global stability, strengthening military support for democratically-elected governments and containing transnational threats, including terrorism and trafficking in narcotics, weapons, and persons. These grants enable allies and friends to improve their defense capabilities and foster closer military relationships between the U.S. and recipient nations.*

Yes, but that is irreverent to our case about money given (not loaned) for any type of use.

I think you're wrong. The church is losing people in Poland for the same reason the church is losing people everywhere: young people are growing up with the internet, and there is a lot of information on the internet, a lot of information contradicting christian teachings. One by one, young people are discovering that the stuff the clergy is preaching is simply outright nonsense. And unlike the times where it was a social taboo to openly call religious nonsense nonsense, today on the internet it is completely free of consequences, so more and more young people are doing it.

Since the only way to get young people to believe this nonsense is to artificially shield them off from information and then mercilessly indoctrinate them with the nonsense, today in the age of free information this does not work any more. Because it can not forcibly indoctrinate the youth, the church is in the unstoppable process of dying. And it is losing young and sane people first, and the insane and old fundamentalists are staying, making the remaining religious community less and less attractive for the sane youngsters they are trying to attract.It is a vicious downward spiral, which can only be broken by forcible indoctrination of children, but today this is not possible any more.

This is contradicted by many first-hand accounts of Syrian refugees. E.g. this one http://web.archive.org/web/20020218171305/http://www.washington-report.org/backissues/062000/0006010.html (original site has changed layout and I'm a little too lazy to search through it, so the wayback archive will have to do).

Of course, there is a good chance that the refugees are lying -- I'm always suspicious about that. However, practical experience shows that statements issued by political or state organizations (government included) are far more likely to be incorrect or incomplete than those of the refugees.

&gt; I'm an Israeli , I worked at farms in the south and visited in the north (Galil Elion). and Israeli,Thai,Moldova, Fillipino , Beduins all work at farms. please show me (I worked for three years at farms , and have family that had crops fields) a single place which will not accept non Israelis. 

I could point out enough examples but I'll settle for one that is peer-reviewed. This study: http://dro.dur.ac.uk/138/1/18CMEIS.pdf cites the example of over 100 farms held by Syrian families that were demolished, the inhabitants ~~evicted~~ umh, forced to flee in various ways, and then given to Israelian settlers.

I will gladly retract my claim that they are Israeli-only -- it is based on my understanding of the occupation that I have formed through means other than first-hand experience, and I have no reason to assume my documentation is perfect -- if you can point even a handful of examples of lands that have been handed over as property to non-Israelis.

That few Israeli people work in these farms is of course expected, but I will venture in assuming that the direct benefits of the exploitation goes to either the Israeli state, in the form of taxation, or to Israeli owners in the form of profit.

This would be fine by itself, of course; what isn't fine by itself is that they never came to inherit or buy these properties, they were duly given ownership of them, which would not have happened if the Israeli state had complied with international law. Under international law, Israel wouldn't be allowed to tax the farms (since they are not on its territory!), nor would have they been allowed to decide on their owner -- again, since by international law, it's not their teritory.

Edit: It may also be worth it -- in before someone comes in citing the legitimacy of territory obtained by war and all that -- that actions such as this one:

&gt; “I remember very well what the Israelis did with us,” he says. “When it began, we fled the house to avoid the bombing. We were hiding in the fields near the village and they found us and made us get down on our knees in a semi-circle with our hands behind our heads and they emptied our pockets and took our stuff—even watches and identity cards.”

which are supported by enough accounts even from the Israeli side are really illegitimate in every possible way, *and* that, just as Pangalos remarked, they *really are* very similar to the events in the ghetto of Warsaw.",0,1351625419,null,0,1351626126,0,c6tzbsp,t3_12c0zu,t1_c6tzbsp,t1_c6tx0h6,null,1430277818,-1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-1

You didn't.

Let's take the ELI10 option.

1) Citizens vote. Citizens are automatically registered in the electoral roll since they become adults.

2) Policemen are citizens. Policemen were citizens before they were policemen. They are also registered in the electoral roll.

3) Policemen have two options when voting. The first option is to vote in special polling stations, along with other policemen. These stations keep special lists with the names of the policemen voting there. The second option is to vote in regular polling stations, in the districts they live, along with other citizens. In order to do that, they take a leave from their duties, and their names are deleted from the aforementioned special lists. The regular polling stations take the names of people voting there from the electoral roll.

4) There is no way to know the occupation of people voting in regular polling stations. It is not recorded in the electoral roll. There is no way to know if 5 policemen or 10 dentists voted in polling station No. 816.

5) Since we are not able to know how many policemen voted in polling station No. 816, if any policemen voted there at all, we are not able to know the party they chose.

I've been saying the exact same things for months now. If it still isn't clear, I can't help much. If it is now, hopefully, and you disagree with the argument above, provide the source of the data for the percentage of policemen voting in polling station No. 816.

Everything I know of their struggle I learned from history books, from the news and from my Israeli friends. I have talked about the subject with them to ensure that my views are not coloured by local propaganda and I'm quite certain that we see ""the events thus far"" similarly.

I still think Israel is on the wrong.

It's a cultural thing and has nothing to do with any propaganda that has anything to do with Israel; I'd instead argue that it has everything to do with 19th century colonisation and cultural values on subjects related to our homelands. After listening for hours how trying to get back ""ancestral homeland"" on the other side of the border or how parts of Africa are ""rightfully"" ours and what this led to, it's very hard to listen about West Bank or Golan Heights and not see similarities.

I'm sure Americans see similarities with settlers vs. savage Indians or something else like that, thinking it's all very noble - while I think most Europeans think even that episode as disgusting example of our colonial history.

&gt; That few Israeli people work in these farms is of course expected, but I will venture in assuming that the direct benefits of the exploitation goes to either the Israeli state, in the form of taxation, or to Israeli owners in the form of profit.

That is about question of sovereignty and not anything else - you can object to occupation (I can accept) but that would not be described the farms as Israeli-only farms.

&gt; This would be fine by itself, of course; what isn't fine by itself is that they never came to inherit or buy these properties, they were duly given ownership of it,

when there will be normalization between the two states land ownership could be resolved (like in cases of Israeli - Jordanian land disputes) - The Israeli legal system did not allow private land ownership in many cases (your comment and study misrepresent the legal state , the land is not owned it is leased) - If a person got permition to work or live on a piece of land that does not make it his.

&gt; which would not have happened if the Israeli state had complied with international law.

if we only talk about the legal case here land accursed in a defensive war is legal to take.

&gt; Under international law, Israel wouldn't be allowed to tax the farms (since they are not on its territory!), nor would have they been allowed to decide on their owner -- again, since by international law, it's not their teritory.

under what law that would happen ?

To me, the main issue is that you are assuming that the non-religious are inherently progressive. People in Serbia don't go to church.

Just like in Ireland (or so I'm told) tradition = religion. People don't truly *believe*, they are simply nationalist, and the religious aspect comes along with it. I've been told the most adamant of Irish nationalists erupt in rage at Protestants, but hardly attend church themselves. Religion in Europe is a very different dynamic from religion in the rest of the world. You are religious because of your nation. In the US and much of the Middle East, as long as you are Christian or Muslim, you are *OK*. But our European fundamentalist parties? You *must* be Christian, but first and foremost you are German/Serbian/Greek, etc. It's a nationalist intolerance first, not a religious one.

That's about 35 years after the conflict, if I counted right. Care to make the grin projection of how many ex-residents of the Golan heights died before having the chance of that, were residents of the Golan heights but their father wasn't born there (bonus points if their mothers were) and so on?

&gt; &gt;   I could point out enough examples but I'll settle for one that is peer-reviewed. This study: http://dro.dur.ac.uk/138/1/18CMEIS.pdf cites the example of over 100 farms held by Syrian families that were demolished, the inhabitants evicted umh, forced to flee because of the war

&gt; That is not what you told before and is an unfortunate result of war, by many definitions I'm also defined as a refugee (fleeing the Israeli south due to war).

Please don't make incomplete quotes. I assume you didn't mean it, but you still left out my argument :-). What I said was:

&gt; I could point out enough examples but I'll settle for one that is peer-reviewed. This study: http://dro.dur.ac.uk/138/1/18CMEIS.pdf cites the example of over 100 farms held by Syrian families that were demolished, the inhabitants evicted umh, forced to flee in various ways, **and then given to Israelian settlers**.

Could one qualify for that without being an Israeli citizen? And if one could, *why not leave them to the Arab inhabitants there in the first place*? It's not like they were building atomic bombs on them, they were doing the exact same thing that Israeli settlers are doing on them now -- that is, farm them -- and, being under Israeli rule and control, they would be pretty much guaranteed not to be hosting people who build atomic bombs on them...

&gt; That not what an Israeli-only farm means - an Israeli-only farm could mean : 1. only Israeli citizen could be at the farm (work) 2. only Israeli citzen could own that farm. For the second part you have some Druze and Cherkese that are not Israeli citizens by choice (have permenant residency) that own farm lands

Fair enough -- I was under the impression that the land of the farms was owned by the state and not available for private ownership. But then...

&gt; The Israeli legal system did not allow private land ownership in many cases (your comment and study misrepresent the legal state , the land is not owned it is leased) - If a person got permition to work or live on a piece of land that does not make it his.

So they are indeed not available for ownership? Very well, then I shall reformulate: the *state of Israel* did not inherit or purchase that land, which makes its exploitation hardly legitimate. We can nitpick over definitions all day, but in my (possibly distorted -- I'm not claiming authority on it) view of property, a piece of land which cannot be owned by someone or something who is not Israel is pretty much Israeli-only. If I park my car on a street that only allows access for the residents of that street, I don't magically become a resident.

&gt; That is about question of sovereignty and not anything else - you can object to occupation (I can accept) but that would not be described the farms as Israeli-only farms.

Yes, it is a question of one state violating the soverignity of another state, which tends to be illegal in the 21st century.

&gt; if we only talk about the legal case here land accursed in a defensive war is legal to take.

That's not exactly true. By default they vote with their police unit. If they take a leave, then they can vote like normal citizens.

&gt; The first option is to vote in special polling stations, along with other policemen. These stations keep special lists with the names of the policemen voting there. 

These polling stations have two lists. One for policemen and one for the rest of the citizens of the neighbourhood. Those are the polling stations we are talking about and from these kinds of polling stations we are trying to get statistics about policemen votes.

&gt; The second option is to vote in regular polling stations, in the districts they live, along with other citizens.

Yes. There is no way to know what the policemen in these regular stations vote. But that is irrelevant to the discussion.

&gt; That's about 35 years after the conflict, if I counted right. Care to make the grin projection of how many ex-residents of the Golan heights died before having the chance of that, were residents of the Golan heights but their father wasn't born there (bonus points if their mothers were) and so on?

I thought it would be better to provide a recent case, but If my memory is correct they had been allowed to return around 1971 (as I don't have the refernce I don't remember the exact year but that was pre 1973 war and after 68' (the Red cross conference).

very important point that is lost to translation the idea of a father born and that a person was born there is to allow descendants to return.  

&gt; Could one qualify for that without being an Israeli citizen? And if one could, why not leave them to the Arab inhabitants there in the first place?

people that had been lucky enough to stay or return within the 40K something (out of 160K I think)  in 67 had been allowed to live.  and there are a lot of people that live and farm there without Israeli citizenship and they own the land if it was their prior to that.further more Israel allow non citizen to have their land (and would get even after decades to a person with the legal right (descendants)).

The Israeli system (based on the British and ottoman) provide an entity that guards that ownership and cannot sell that land (unless there are legal quirks)  , 

&gt; a piece of land which cannot be owned by someone or something who is not Israel is pretty much Israeli-only.

but there are cases that people that are not Israeli citizens (Syrian citizens with Israeli permenant residents) own farm land (pre 1967).

&gt; Under the Charter of the United Nations, of which Israel is a signatory country, and in accordance to the principles of international law (you know, the body of treaties under which the existence of modern states -- including your own -- is guaranteed), imposing laws over territories of another country is an attack to the political and economical independence of that country, which is explicitly forbidden by article 2(4) in the UN charter.

So If an Israeli citizen working in canada needs to pay taxes to pay to both parties (dual VAT/tax, income tax) that would be forbidden ? 

the same of Canadian citizen working in Israel and has to pay dual taxes (Canadian and Israeli) does it also forbidden,

Like all high ground, the moral high ground is a relative metric.

The Palestinians have no qualms about targeting Israeli civilians, and even obviously heinous murders of Israeli civilians merit only brief and reluctant condemnations from Palestinian officials. There is very little self-criticism among Palestinians, except criticizing people who ""collaborate"" too much with Israel. Israel has the power to, at any moment, expel or kill vast numbers of Palestinians, and yet they never have. They could have cited the Benes decrees and expelled the Palestinians, or cited Black September and killed thousands to weaken Palestinian groups, but they haven't. Why not? Think about that.

&gt; So If an Israeli citizen working in canada needs to pay taxes to pay to both parties (dual VAT/tax, income tax) that would be forbidden ? 

No, it is not the payment of taxes in both places that I am referring to as being illegitimate, it's the unilateral extension of laws. People have obligations to both the country of which they are citizens and to those where they reside -- even in trivial cases, like when you're a tourist, you are expected to abide the laws of the countries you visit.

However, if Canada were to declare that Tel-Aviv is now Canadian teritory and begin extending Canadian laws over it, that *would* be a problem, particularly if they suddenly decided to enforce this by stationing armies there, since stationing army on another state's teritory against that state's will is a breach of sovereignty. It's also a state of war, I have no problem with that, but if it's a warzone then the legality of settling it with civilian occupants, especially at the expense of *other*, evicted civilian occupants, is shaky to say the least. The ""it was all defensive"" argument is childish here -- by that argument, the US should have a legitimate claim over half of Germany and most of the Pacific islands -- after all they occupied them in WWII while fighting a defensive war -- and England would have a pretty legitimate claim on India, I mean sure, they occupied it offensively at some point... but then they were mostly driven out of it and re-occupied some of its territory while defending against Japan in WWII.

I have literally no idea what you're talking about with Mitt Romney. If anything, Mitt Romney exemplifies how non-denominational America is: as a Mormon, Mitt Romney is part of a minority sect that up until not that long ago was considered heretical by many Americans and is still considered weird by most.

So you've made religion into a socially unacceptable topic. Again, it's like saying, ""I'm uncomfortable with you being open about your homosexuality because it's not polite to talk about sexuality, so you should probably just not mention it ever."" It's not government-enforced oppression, but it seems oppressive. I understood that you were not advocating for China-like government suppression of religion, but I still think the European ""shh, don't talk about that, that's weird"" is bad.

My experience is that Europeans tend to think that church-based activities are inherently indicative of strong religious beliefs, whereas in America, churches are often just social hubs. Practically everyone in my New England high school went to Sunday school and confirmation classes of some type, but very few of us were religious. We just went because our parents expected us to and our friends were there anyway. I remember when a bunch of Americans and Europeans were hanging out together when we were studying abroad in Israel, and when the Americans began to reminisce about going to religiously-run camps (either Jew Camp or summer camps run by local Catholic churches), the Europeans looked at us like we were Opus Dei and those crazy Jewish fundamentalists who spit on people in Jerusalem.

true,leondz,EURO,European Union,"It's not unacceptable - quite the opposite. But don't expect me to care about what you did at church last week. Why should I be bound by some protocol to be forced to respect religions? And so, because we have a large number of atheists who've grown tired of centuries of corruption and manipulation in religion and excised it from their states, it is easier to avoid making enemies by avoiding contentious topics in public, such as religious beliefs. But this is just normal, human conversational protocol, and nothing specific to any region.

Your New England experience sounds very much like christianity in Old England, too. Religion is viewed very differently in France, where it has been forcibly ostracised from government, and in Italy or Romania, where the flavour of Christianity is different and much more pervasive in all of the culture. And then there's the Lutherans in the north, who practise in a very quiet, understated way.

If you have a selection of camps to go to, why go to a religious one? My personal view - I cannot speak for the 580 million of us - is that it's best to avoid fueling the religious fire and encouraging the spread of such ideas (I am atheist). Indeed, making a camp's topic religion would suggest to me that at some point, a person will start to discuss parts of their creed and I should engage with them on the topic, which to me is not something I would ever do voluntarily.

Edit: As for Romney, you have a point, but the fact that the populace would entertain someone who has openly fallen for something as patently concocted as Mormonism gives an impression that all kinds of weird logic and flaky ideas are permitted and possibly even encouraged in every echelon of society. I now realise I have a strong bias here.

So, talking about religion is socially acceptable? That makes your previous claim that being vocally religious makes you sound less credible, which means that being vocally religious is an unacceptable position to take in social setting. Which is it? Is it okay to talk about religion or do you give the cold shoulder to people who acknowledge their religion publicly?

&gt; Why should I be bound by some protocol to be forced to respect religions? 

It's not about respecting religions: it's about respecting your fellow man and his choices about his identity. You have adamantly refused to acknowledge my comparison to telling homosexuals to stay in the closet, which is the best possible analogy to how I--and many other Americans--feel about Europeans' view of religion.

&gt; If you have a selection of camps to go to, why go to a religious one?

The vast majority of parents sent their kids to Jew/Catholic camp because those camps were the best-funded and best-run or simply because their kids' friends went there. Personally, I went to Boy Scout camp, which was not religious, but it wasn't a decision by my parents to avoid religious-based camps: it was because I was a Boy Scout and my friends were Boy Scouts and we could have fun at summer camp together. Likewise, my catholic friends went to Catholic-run camps because their friends were in CCD with them or whatever, and their summer camps were not really that different from my Boy Scout camp.

Also, aside from the Boy Scouts, there were no summer camps run by non-religious groups, aside from church camps all you have are Boy Scout camps and the YMCA. But that's because in America our churches are social hubs that provide a bunch of social services to communities, not places just to go to think about God.

&gt;  it's best to avoid fueling the religious fire and encouraging the spread of such ideas (I am atheist).

Aaaaaaaaand there it is. That is exactly the kind of intolerance for religion that makes me so uncomfortable around many Europeans.

No. But it's not unacceptable either; there's an absence of acceptance when discussing matters internal to a religion. Meta-discussion about religion(s) is generally fine, but due to the broad mix of ideas, somewhat delicate.

&gt; You have adamantly refused to acknowledge my comparison to telling homosexuals to stay in the closet

Homosexuality isn't a choice; religion is. Bias toward people for things they have not chosen is unfair. Bias toward people for things that they have control over is somewhat fair. Religion, after reaching the age of reason, is a choice, and certainly not physiological (though predisposition to it can be).

&gt; The vast majority of parents sent their kids to Jew/Catholic camp because those camps were the best-funded and best-run or simply because their kids' friends went there. Personally, I went to Boy Scout camp, which was not religious, but it wasn't a decision by my parents to avoid religious-based camps

This sounds like a parenting choice, rather than anything to do with the cultures of the European countries I have lived in. I was sent to catechism every Sunday, for example, and maybe we said prayers at scouts, but I didn't care much for them. Different parents have different ideas. I'd imagine atheists anywhere in the world might be less likely to send their children to events involving religions, but I don't think I get the relevance of the region-based difference between the US and this mythical homogeneous state of Europe with which you draw comparisons.

&gt; That is exactly the kind of intolerance for religion that makes me so uncomfortable around many Europeans.

We have lots of different views. We're not all Christian, and we don't all think religion is OK. Respect that many of us don't want to hear about religion, or that many may have radically different views to yours that are kept quiet in order to maintain a friendship. If nobody puts their conflicting ideas on the table in too forthright a fashion, accord is easier. Dawkins is quite objectionable, really; nobody wants to hear that sort of thing at every dinner table -- so we keep our often-opposing views quiet. I don't think I would call that suppression; perhaps diplomacy.

I think most Americans would understand 'cheeky' even if it was not familiar to them- on the other hand 'unabashed' has quite a formal meaning/context so I'm wondering if that formalism is out of place here.  Perhaps 'cheeky' is the fine because, like the French, it combines a somewhat informal mode of speech with the particular meaning of 'unabashed'?

As an alternate, and to keep the racially charged theme that Le Point is going for, I'd suggest 'uppity'.  It's a word that has basically the same meaning and, even more importantly, is very racially charged in the US (usually associated with black people acting outside their 'station': see segregation).  So if you wanted to, um, maintain the same offensiveness and capture the appropriate meaning I think that's the word I'd go with....

The general spirit of America is that there is no compromise, you are an individual and forming your own opinion and living according to it is sacrosanct, and no need to hold yourself back, so some people will do really weird things like this, because this is what they want, and some other people like the SRS will condemn it really furiously, breathing fire, because this is is their individual opinion, similarly sacrosanct, and no need to hold yourself back. So they always go for the extremes, for example you are either a gay-hater or someone who hates the gay-haters, no compromise in the middle. Or for example America produces both the most porn and the most porn-hating Bible-thumping Protestant preachers. Because this is the general spirit, form your own individual opinion and blast it on both barrels, no compromise, no holding back, use your freedom to the most.

The general spirit of Western Europe is that most people think in a compromise-oriented ways, going for the center, not even consciously, they are just simply used to orienting themselves towards what is the generally accepted public opinion. So for example Western Europe doesn't do creepshots because the public opinion generally thinks it is not cool, but if and when some people do, then again others will not get as furious about it as the SRS, there will be only a moderate condemnation. Living in Vienna, the general compromise about gay people seems to be that they don't get hated, in return they try not to behave and dress too conspicuously (""unauffällig""), they just try to blend in to ""cis-gendered"" (i.e. normal, standard) norms mostly. Western Europe compromises between the porn-loving young padawan and the porn-hating Catholic grandma, resulting in producing low amounts of held-back, moderate, half-ashamed porn (except for Italy). 

And in Eastern Europe the whole problem just doesn't arise this way. Most people are too busy and tired trying to survive and make a living to care about such stuff either way, and those who are rich can easily satisfy all their perversions with a fairly low amount of money spent.

""Nazi symbols"" is also quite hard to put a ban on. I remember the case in Germany some years ago where anti-nazi symbols were illegal because they contained a swastika. Meanwhile, neonazi groups used other symbols that were not illegal at the time but clearly associated with neonazism.

Now, I understand the reason why these laws exist in Germany.

&gt; **3 novembre 2011, morts en direct**

&gt; Nous sommes à Cannes, où se déroule le G 20. Le Premier ministre grec, qui vient d'annoncer son intention de soumettre le plan d'aide à la Grèce à un référendum national, est convoqué pour s'expliquer. [...] Les portes se ferment. La discussion dure près de deux heures, sans pause. Merkel est face à Papandréou. A la gauche de Merkel, Sarkozy, face à Obama. A la droite de la chancelière, Schäuble [NDLR : ministre féderal des Finances]. A la gauche de Sarkozy, Juppé. Et à la gauche de Juppé, moi. Le climat est lourd, pesant ; la tension est extrême. Commence alors un bras de fer avec Papandréou, assisté de son ministre des Finances. Sarkozy lance au Premier ministre grec : ""On te le dit clairement, si tu fais ce référendum, il n'y aura pas de plan de sauvetage."" Papandréou fait mine de ne pas comprendre. Avec un regard d'acier, Merkel lui redit la même chose de façon très ferme. C'est une guerre psychologique. La tension grimpe alors d'un cran. Sarkozy lui répète nos conditions sur un ton d'ultimatum. Papandréou transpire, résiste, essaie d'argumenter. [...]

&gt; Obama observe la scène, écoute attentivement. Il résume parfois la situation, calme le jeu quand le ton monte. Papandréou joue sa carrière. Il transpire de plus en plus, vacille dans ses propos, puis s'effondre. Acculé, il n'a pas d'autre choix que de se prononcer en faveur ou non de l'euro. Il comprend qu'il ne pourra pas échapper à cette question en la soumettant à son peuple. J'assiste à sa mort politique en direct.

true,naughty,null,null,"The issues with the CAP are actually quite complicated. The wikipedia [article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Agricultural_Policy#Criticism_of_the_CAP) is quite good.

It boils down to a few issues:

* Certain countries have very large farming sectors for pretty much purely geographical reasons, e.g. France has only 1.05 times the population of the UK but 2.24 times the area.
* The productivity of farms is very variable over the EU.
* The percentage of the population involved in farming varies quite a bit over the EU.

So you end up in the situation where urbanised, high population density countries 'pay' the for larger, sparser countries to farm. While farming efficiency has improved over all the EU it has been slower in countries that get a better deal from the CAP.

One of the main impediments to change is that the Agricultural Council requires unanimity instead of qualified majority. So those that benefit can easily block reform, although changes have happened over the years.

Another reason is that you need a big country to really push any change in the EU and the most likely country, in this case the UK, couldn't get CAP reformed (but didn't really try that hard) so negotiated a rebate for itself. Any change to the CAP would require the UK to drop its rebate, which any UK PM would find hard to do.",0,1351680080,null,0,false,0,c6uapy0,t3_12bwvq,t1_c6uapy0,t1_c6twnag,null,1430283413,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt;  I remember the case in Germany some years ago where anti-nazi symbols were illegal because they contained a swastika.

This got kicked out right away in the revision, crossed out swastikas are OK (as are swastikas on Hindu temples, before anybody tries to be a smartass).

&gt;  Meanwhile, neonazi groups used other symbols that were not illegal at the time but clearly associated with neonazism.

Neonazism isn't banned. The Swastika (with a capital ""S"") is banned as the party symbol of the NSDAP, which is categorized as an ""organization that has the goal of abolishing the constitution and the democratic order"". The same goes for related organizations, such as the SS. You can't promote those organizations (display of the Swastika), but you can still show it to display opposition, or for artistic and education purposes.

&gt;  out of principal I cannot support these kinds of limitations on free speech.

I think you're looking at it the wrong way. There is a fundamental right to freedom of expression. There also are other fundamental rights, like human dignity or privacy, and in Germany there additionally is the concept of a ""militant democracy"" (i.e., one that can defend itself against attempts to abolish it from within). Sometimes those rights are in conflict, and a balance has to be found. Obviously, this isn't always easy and reasonable people might disagree about where to draw the line. But an absolutist approach to freedom of speech would be avoiding the difficult questions at the cost of other fundamental rights that are themselves worthy of protection.

Prendre 1 milliard à Google parce qu'ils ont fait un montage financier pour esquiver le fisc, ça ne me choque pas. L'état est aux abois et cherche à racler les fonds de tiroir, on ne peut pas demander aux classes pauvres de faire un effort et en même temps épargner les entreprises qui font des profits.

Pour revenir sur les résultats de Google en France, en citant le papier du Figaro dont nous parlons :

&gt;Grâce à une série de montages financiers, baptisés ""sandwich hollandais"" ou ""double irlandais"", Google réussit à ne payer qu'un très faible pourcentage d'impôts car la quasi-totalité des revenus déclarés en Irlande, après un passage aux Pays-Bas via une société intermédiaire, est transférée dans le paradis fiscal des Bermudes où est sise la filiale Google Ireland Holdings.

Si les résultats de Google France apparaissent si bas sur societe.com, c'est précisément à cause de montages financiers destinés à esquiver le fisc.

This paragraph is all kinds of wrong, this is not the 3rd attempt to tackle the deficit, the social security changes  were never about the deficit and would have had a marginal impact on the deficit (at best 500 million euros), the constitutional court rulling had no impact on current operations of the government since they allowed the cuts in 2012, and was ruled way before the planning of 2013 budget so the government went to plan 2013 budget already knowing what they could and could not do.

This is wrong, the constitutional court said the government needed to have equality in the austerity between public/private workers and capital, the austerity could not be only on the shoulders of public workers and that was the violation the court found.

Also it was not on cuts to public workers benificts, it was cuts of 2/14th of the public workers salaries (public workers go from doctors, nurses, police, military, judges, etc.)

&gt;and a plan to hike social security payments was abandoned after street protests.

Is very simplistic to say it was due to street protest when on reality was a union of all quadrants of the society. Was the first time everyone from left to right, from big business to unions, all were joined in opposition of the measure, the street protest was only the culmination of a week of never before seen union around the stupidity of that proposal.

&gt;The 2013 budget, relying instead on large rises in income tax – of up to two months' salaries in some cases – is the culmination of those previous policy failures.

Trotzdem würde niemand deren Existenzberechtigung bestreiten. Über diese Axiome hinaus kann uns aber auch die Naturwissenschaft keine Erkenntnis liefern. Stört aber auch nur wenige.

Die Erkenntnisgewisse und neu Aufgestellten Hypothesen bewegen sich in der Theologie halt einfach innerhalb eines abgesteckten Rahmens. Und da sind sehr wohl Erkenntnisfortschritte möglich. Hypothesen können durch hermeneutische und logische Arbeit falsifiziert werden. Hinzu kommt die historisch-kritische Forschung. Der ""Fortschritt"" ist eben einfach weniger deutlich erkennbar als in den Naturwissenschaften, weil es nun mal einfach viel schwieriger ist, in den Geisteswissenschaften zu allgemein anerkannten Ergebnissen zu kommen.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Sounds exactly like a right-wing program in Hungary with the exception of taxation. Question: are you sure it is ""economically left"" ? In my opinion the essence of right is not uncritical free-marketism, but simply a resistance to the left-wing notion of ""justice as equality"" and instead believing in ""justice as what you deserve"", and see the free market as a _tool_ for this purpose, which can be overridden if it was abused.

So for example if an when an economic elite is getting rich on fraud and corruption and not in fair dealings, I think it is in line with right-wing thinking to restore justice-as-just-deserts by massively ""reseting"" the system. 

Another thing is that it sounds like at least 50% of it is nationalism. Well, this is fairly normal. Generally speaking in an economically strong and central country like the USA or UK right-wing nationalists can be free-marketists because the economy even without intervention is playing a dominant role in the world. But if you are in an economically weak country, in the periphery and not center of globalisation, then of course nationalists will be for intervention because otherwise their economy is just dominated  by the much more richer Western/central capital. For example if international capital is allowed to buy land, it could be that the farmers who sell it spend the money, and then from that on the agriculture will only consist of wage laborers working for rich foreigners, like in colonialization, of course a right-wing nationalist cannot support that.

IMHO for a rich-country nationalist globalisation is serving their own national interest and glory so they can allow it to go unrestricted, but for a poor-country nationalist globalisation unrestricted would probably mean being locked in a colonialized, low-glory, second-rate status - even when monetarily it might worth it.

So IMHO center-of-globalization vs. peripheria-of-globalisation politics cannot really be meaningfully compared. As my dad said about girls, boys and sex when I was a teenager: there is a lot of difference in spitting out of a window or spitting in a window.
