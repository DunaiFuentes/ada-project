* A heath care system that won't bankrupt you if you get sick and doesn't fight you every step of the way.
* Vacation time
* The public infrastructure
* A decent primary education system.
* The bread
* The cheese
* Your Internet speeds
* Your culture in general. Go check out r/athiesm, r/IWantOut, r/politics and see how frustrated people are over there.

The more money you make, the more heavily you are taxed.
In addition to the 25% VAT, all things that are considered luxury items are taxed more as well.

The infamous example is cars. Besides VAT, a 180% registration tax is added to the price. This means you pay for three cars when you buy one. There are deductions for fuel economy, and since the fuel isn't cheap either, many buy small cars or use an old car. From an environmental standpoint, this is better than the SUV plague the US has, but the effect is debatable since old cars are not very fuel efficient. 
Getting back on topic, you are not likely to work long hours to get a nice car in Denmark. The payoff is too small.

Other things that are expensive include restaurants (since the tax is high, the base salary must also be higher, which means your meal is pretty expensive). The average Dane doesn't go out much, and inexpensive fastfood places are preferred if they do.

Housing isn't cheap either. All in all, danes have very little money to spend when all is said and done.

true,Hembygdsgaarden,SWED,Sweden,"Without offending you, i have to say i don't understand the basis of your reasoning. There is a great influx of Turkish population in regions of Europe, take Berlin for example, a city no one can argue is devoid of a turkish population - but still at that, they only comprise about 250 000, or 8% of the total population. Berlin is of course not the model of economic progress in Germany, however, it really isn't big on sectarian violence or rioting either. 

What i really do not understand is the reasoning behind why Turks, who not only are a very ""westernized"", but has been for the last 300 years or so, should all of a sudden deliver to the rest of Europe, a population of 10 million islamist fundamentalists? As you may know, Turkey is at this very moment ruled by a religious conservative party, and still it maintans a fervent secular agenda. Moreover, Turkeys version of islam is Hanafi, wich should be consider as far from Islamism as Desmond Tutu is to the KKK. And remember, Hanafi is also one of the largest Muslim movements, but since they aren't very pious or zealous, they don't make for very good media coverage. Turkey as well lends itself a lot to Sufism, wich, most devout orthodox muslims consider to be sort of the ""hippie-version"" of islam. 

No, what i think you fear, is the growth of the Re-born muslim movement, often simplified as ""islamism"", but it has a lot of similarities with the reactionary movement by christians in Europe during the seventies, as well as the radicalized political left - the content is different, the context isn't. There is an anti-establishment sentiment brewing in many muslim countries, and all things considering, (autocratic governance, lack of transparency, unemployment) rightfully so. If anything, most people coming west is trying to escape this polemic reality, not establish it somewhere else. There is however, a rather unsettling idea permiating european policy nowadays, that place immigrants from these countries in a state of limbo with limited rights and limited access to the workforce, the exact opposite of what we know promotes secularism and integration. 

With that said, i think bringing Turkey in to the EU-landscape would serve to pressure their government to amend the lack of transparency and progressive reform, the very things that makes people leave it in the first place.

true,Hembygdsgaarden,SWED,Sweden,"The problems with forums is usually that they are just that - forums, wich offer a very problematic view of the world. Forums by it's nature has a rather large portion of strongly opinionated people. As in all form of media, the broad middle road isn't very well represented in original posts, nor does it make for good by-lines or catchy titles. Yet we all live there, and the voting populace most certainly do. Perhaps the best testament to the ingenuity of democracy is not the voting in itself, but rather the lack of polarization that comes with the fact that majority isn't a given constant, but always have to be argued and bartered for. 

In essence? I think the radicals throwing Eggs at Lars Vilks isn't the same that fly planes in to buildings, if so, both he and Salman Rushdie would have been dead long time ago. A strong transparent government is a good inoculator for extremism. It is however not perfect - as Anders Behring Breivik showed in the Utøya disaster - but will always be susceptible to the whims of a madman. It is however a false statement to consider for example all anti-feminists to be potential mass murderers, as well as it is false to consider that even a majority of muslims would be react with outcry by south park - but you never report on the outcry that *didn't* manifest - that's just not news-worthy. And since neither you nor i live in a islamic country, we rarely see anything but the news - and conflict sells. There is no substantial truth that there is a vigorous fundamentalist islamic minority in Europe, if it were, where is the political parties? Many muslims came from the balkans in the 90ies, iran and iraq during the 80ies, and turkey, lebanon, syria in between. Many of these muslims enjoy citizenship, and are thusly allowed to vote, but where is their political representation? If there actually was a brewing islamistic political movement in the west, shouldn't it also be some islamistic parties? Let's return to Berlin, where the extreme right wing garnered 1,2% of the votes, smaller parties not being properly accounted for in the polls, but there IS no party above 1% catering to muslims however. If there was any indication of a strong islamistic movement, shouldn't it replicate the Hamas in Palestine for example? But no, there isn't even a moderate islamic movement. 

Regarding the ""Taking jobs"" argument, it usually is that or ""Not working"" that is used. Adressing the issue in itself is a pretty complex matter - but to simplify it: The amount of jobs isn't constant. If you for example instead of going for a low income job, get an education, then taking a job that few have the competence to do, it really is the other way around for the ""reciever""-country. The same goes for someone starting a company for example. At the same time, this is more a question of how far unionization of labor has come, and wether you actually have the indigenous population actually accepting the job in the first place. We also know that bias is not in favor of non-nationals as far as names are concerned, and that Europe have a demographic issue with early pensions and an ageing population. As of now we also see how the migratory patterns also works as a balancing act as to allocating resources, wages increase as a result of lowered trading fees between countries, as well as work and opportunity in those countries. Unskilled labor however, will more and more be phased out, such is the nature of technology, and thusly, education will still stand as the bulwark of economic development. These concerns, and quite a few others, lead me to think that the ""coming here - taking jobs"" is very much an oversimplification.

However, once you factor in cost of living (for the people) and tax revenue (for the government - from the people) you get a much different story.

Example: I used to live in Denmark but now live in the UK. I bought a Volvo C30 2 years ago in the UK for £19,000. That same car, as speced on the Danish Volvo site (as close as possible, not all features are available in Denmark): £53,000. 
Maybe it's roughly the same as £19,000 when you factor in cost of living &amp; higher salaries, but I don't recall many 25 year old design/engineering professionals in Denmark buying a brand new car 2 years after leaving university.

I'm not sure where you get the idea that Danes don't have a lot of money to spend when all is said and done. Do you have statistics on that or are you speaking from personal experience? Speaking from the suburban middle class (perhaps upper-middle class) a lot of the families I know have a really nice house, two cars, two computers and a smartphone per person, and go abroad on vacation every year. And that's without working in executive positions or cheating on their taxes.

You're correct about how eating out is expensive though. Personally I find it oddly enjoyable that fast food is one of the more expensive options, but I do wish my lunch sandwiches were cheaper. If decent restaurants were more affordable, I'd probably eat more healthily all around, as I hate to cook.

Short version: it's not my experience that Danes have less money to spend after all is said and done than neighbouring countries or even your average US citizen. But I'm willing to be proven wrong if you have any statistics to throw at me :-)

These people also don't tend to move given the fact that they have jobs and nice lives. The people who do want to move tend to be poorer and politically more radical. If they move to a large country like Germany (as they do now) or France they can't influence much unless they concentrate in a single area and take over on the local level (not very likely) but in a smaller county, they just might be able to pull it off.

My country only has a population of 4.5 million, 100k immigrants would radically change the political landscape, not in the direction of Sharia, but in the direction of fundamental Christianity and nationalism which are, in essence, just as bad. Here, on a regional level, even 25k-50k people could force a majority.

The idea that they could come in and turn the whole of Europe Muslim or even an entire country is silly, but even now we are seeing the return of right wing fundamentalism in a big way and small concentrated immigrant communities attempting to get more autonomy in the way they implement the law. 

While most concerns amount to nothing but fear mongering and xenophobia, those that are real can't simply be lumped together with the rest. They must be considered and addressed by the leaders of both the EU and Turkey, presented and explained to both peoples.

true,koleye,UNSA,American Europhile,"&gt;Today, if Europeans wish to find concrete support for the values that unite them, it's France or bust. The usual alternative, Britain, is retreating from European politics -- reducing its military profile and leaning heavily on France in the process.

I found this to be among the more interesting statements in the article. I definitely think it is true that France maintains a better image than Germany that is conducive to further integration and a solution to the crisis. It is also true that the UK has always been a bit more aloof in integration schemes. Unfortunately, Germany's image has suffered because of its recommended economic policies toward other member states. I think it is unfortunate that so there is so much emphasis on a German style of economic reform. Germany is hardly the only economic exemplar in the union. It is, more simply, the largest ""healthy"" economy. The Netherlands, Luxembourg, Austria, Finland, and Sweden are all in fairly good shape as well, but no one is looking to them to solve the crisis. Thus, it is a fallacy to think that solutions to the crisis have to come from Germany. The current crisis is not a German one, nor a French one, nor a Greek one. It is a European one. It is a negative result of decades of integration that was bound to happen sooner or later. The solution to this crisis has to be a European one, not a German one, and not a French one.

OK, maybe I should add a bit more info. For travels around Europe, some budget airlines fly to Leipzig-Halle. Nearby cities of interest for short trips would be Dresden, Weimar and of course Berlin ([InterConnex](http://www.interconnex.com/index.html) is a regional railway company and charges between €14 and €23 for a one way ticket to Berlin, depending on how early you book, and can be cheaper than [Deutsche Bahn](http://www.bahn.de/i/view/DEU/en/index.shtml)). Generally, with DB, you can get pretty far for cheap if you book a specific train in advance, the earlier, the cheaper. However, you will be tied to that exact departure time, whereas normal ticket prices are for pay-and-go connections. This includes destinations outside of Germany.

Erlangen has some interesting cities nearby as well, Nuremberg is ridiculously close, Munich is relatively near, and there are cities like Bamberg or Bayreuth that you could visit on a day trip.

I'd say that from a travel perspective, Erlangen and Leipzig are about equally well located as far as geography is concerned, but Leipzig is the better hub.

This is why the European Commission is the only body that's allowed to present and draft EU legislation (unlike most countries where parliaments have that power too).

Why this is the case is because traces back to the 1950's when the EU was called the European Coal and Steel Community. Neither member states felt like they had the right to control each others' businesses, so they thought the idea of creating a (in theory) nationally and ideologically independent group of people who oversaw the coal and steel business between them.

This is why, for better or worse, we have one Commissioner per country. Sure – it creates a lot of unnecessary Commissioners but at least we're all represented somewhat. The Commissioners are also not bound to any government that happens to be in power of that country at the time, either. And it's ideally the Commission is meant to be less ideological too – even though commissioners are politically appointed and usually are attached to a political party.

They're also all considered a part of a team. So after the European Council releases their list of people, the European Parliament can only vote to elect or block *all* of them – not single Commissioners. Same thing applies to forced resignation/impeachment; if one Commissioner is corrupt and kicked out the entire Commission gets kicked out.",0,1331118505,null,0,false,0,c3yj79f,t3_qlimr,t1_c3yj79f,t3_qlimr,null,1428482124,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

What they do largely in France is just 2. 1 and 3 are left out. So technically the meat is not even halal. And I get it that its done solely for economic reasons. So lets not get the Muslim folks into this discussions.

About those that eat meat and yet fight for the treatment of animals, its pretty hypocritical. You mention the word Sentient beings. - beings with consciousness. We largely assume we are the only species with feelings and thus treat everything else as resources to be used and traded -animals included.

Cameron? Nein ich bin von ihm ueberhaupt nicht ueberzeugt. Er kommt mir total oberflaechlig vor. Alles nur Soundbites. Waehrend Obama ""universal healthcare"" einfuehrt, versucht Cameron mit unseren NHS in die andere Richtung zu gehen. Was haelst du eigentlich von dieser ""Obamacare"" Grundsatz?

Ich glaube es wuerde England zwingen naeher an Europa zu werden, weil unser ""Macht"" vielleicht ein bisschen weniger wuerde. Trotz, dass ziemlich viele Englander Euroskeptisch sind.

- Francois Hollande

- DSK* (Was the overwhelming favorite. Had to pull out because of his sex scandal. Was seen as pretty rightist, but no one really knew his domestic policies as he worked outside of France for so long)

- Manuel Valls (Most right, pro- free market. Closer to centre and center right parties)

After DSK could no longer compete, the main candidates were Hollande, Aubry, Royale and Montebourg. Of them, Hollande is the most to the right. 

Basically this means that if he's leader he'll probably continue something similar to what Sarkozy had done. There wont be any major changes in French society than if Aubry or Montebourg would have won. Retirement age will continue at 62, some public cuts, less laws stricter to companies etc. Basically something similar to British Labour or ""business as usual"".

In German- and French-speaking media I can't find anything at all about the DAB (name of the intelligence service at the time) dealing with Ghanem, or even on Hani Ramadan's or Pierre Bayenet's blogs (both hosted by the Tribune de Genève.)  No info anywhere on al-Ghanem's involvement (I've tried multiple spellings).

There was a case (Operation Memphis) of [""mosque espionage""](http://www.blick.ch/news/schweiz/schnueffel-opfer-reicht-klage-ein-id122136.html) (German link to one of our tabloids).  There's a parliamentary investigation going on right now whether either the federal or Geneva cantonal cops operated illegally.  The agent, a guy named Covassi, alleges that the DAP ordered him to plant evidence that a bunch of islamists were targeting an El Al airliner ([source](http://www.blick.ch/news/schweiz/300-seiten-dokumente-fuer-die-spion-aufsicht-id122408.html), again, _Blick_, the same tabloid).  

Basically, two academics (Tariq Ramadan and his brother Hani) have been making a lot of pseudo-islamist noise in Switzerland for years, pissing off a lot of people who suspect them of being somehow involved with islamist nasty types but unable to conclusively prove it.  

Our (Swiss) secret police and the federal prosecutors are a bunch of clowns who've repeatedly proven themselves to be utterly incompetent chasing after phantom drug barons, money launderers, mafiosi, and islamists.  The last one I remember is when they destroyed a private banker's career based on an illegal German secret service operation and a Colombian drug dealer who claimed he had contacts to a huge nefarious organized crime network (but turned out to be a horrible, expensive fraud).

I honestly don't know what to believe in this case - the only source for the involvement of al-Ghanem appears to be a copy of a letter ""in the possession of the Independent"", and Covassi's (the agent) credibility was already in doubt because he failed to appear twice in front of the parliamentary commission - who have now however said that his allegations are believable, so the head of the secret police (von Däniken) is probably going to be in trouble anyway.

I'm a bit surprised about the supposed Egyptian colonel angle.  The major papers are pretty partisan, and given the fact that the guy who ran the responsible department (defense &amp; sport) from 2001-2009 was a vain idiot whom pretty much everyone hated, normally the Swiss press would be over this like flies on shit.  Add to that the fact that Pierre Bayenet is a reputable, fairly serious human rights attorney, who wouldn't restrict his public commentary on a 6-year-old case to a single op-ed contributor to a UK newspaper, but would have been making stupid amounts of noise in the domestic press and I'm a bit skeptical about this part of the overall story.

Hi, I'm sorry, but I'd like to know where you get this idea.  I know it's a frequent bit of German media populism to portray your greedy, crooked, retarded, funny-accented little bros to the South as some sort of obnoxious banana republic, but this is simply not the case.  Do you _know_ anything about our separation of powers or intra-governmental control mechanisms?  Because I kinda doubt it, sorry if this sounds defensive.

The Parliamentary GPDel is an extremely effective tool.  As it is proving right now.  Separation of powers between the legislative, executive (despite the absence of a clear single ""President"" which does not seem to be much of an advantage in other, ahem, countries) and judicial branches is clear and consistent.  Politicians and parties who have ""the dumb"" are regularly voted out of office due to our strong direct democracy.

The national police, despite being a gang of idiots whenever they try to do something besides solve crimes (which they're actually quite good at) and go into the realm of ""political crimes"", are under good surveillance, as this case proves.

I'm expressing doubt about one single aspect of this case, which is founded on nothing more than an alleged quote by an attorney (which I cannot find referenced anywhere else, in any English-, German-, or French-speaking media), and a letter supposedly in the possession of a single paper.

If you don’t need that (maybe you are content with using Skype or something like that, I don’t know, probably not) Congstar can be awesome.

Here is one [possibility](http://www.congstar.de/smart-100/tarifinfos/):

* It’s not a contract, so you always only pay for one month (but you have to be careful, it’s also available as a 24 month contract)
* €19.99 per month, €25 as the initial payment to get the SIM cards (a normal one and a micro SIM)
* Like always in Germany, all incoming calls are free, you get 100 free minutes for all outgoing calls inside Germany, €0.19 for every additional minute
* Unlimited SMS (inside Germany), €0.39 per MMS
* Unlimited data, HSPA 3.6 speeds for 300MB, GPRS speeds (which is really sucky) for everything beyond that (so that means 300 usable MB, but at least you don’t have to pay extra if you go over)

If you want to make calls to France you are probably looking at something like [blau.de](http://www.blau.de):

* It’s availible prepaid and postpaid, you probably want postpaid, but, again, there is no 24 month contract
* For €16.90 you get 200 minutes, 200 SMS (all inside Germany) and unlimited data, but only 500MB at useful 3G speeds
* Alternatively, you could pay something like €14.80 and get no minutes but unlimited SMS (inside Germany) and unlimited data with 100 usable MB
* Other variations are also possible
* Any additional minutes or SMS inside of Germany cost 9Cent
* Calls to landline in France cost 9Cent/min, calls to mobile cost 29Cent/min; SMS to France cost 13Cent

Here is the [price list for inside of Germany](http://www.blau.de/tarif/inland), [outside of Germany](http://www.blau.de/tarif/ausland).

I’m happy to help you out if you want to know anything more specific about the carriers and their rates. It’s a confusing mess, I can’t even imagine figuring that out if you don’t have a perfect grip on German. (Also carriers: Y U NO TRANSLATE WEBSITE?!)

""The problems with the 'Kony 2012' campaign: Ok so let's get this out of the way first, the basic idea of the campaign is great, to raise awareness of a war criminal that uses children as soldiers and sex slaves. Unfortunately the whole campaign seems to be missing the bigger political picture, I think this is nicely demonstrated in the statement of its second goal: 'That the U.S. military advisers support the Ugandan Army until Kony has been captured and the LRA has been completely disarmed. They need to follow through all the way and finish what they have started.' This statement not only suggests that the campaign is in favour of U.S. intervention but is completely uncritical of the Ugandan Government and its army, both of whom are by no means 'the good guys' in this. I can't be bothered going into too much detail but here are a few key points:

1) The Ugandan Government is a dictatorship with Yoweri Museveni as the president since 1986. Among many of its human rights violations the regime tortures prisons, oppresses other political parties and the press and also wishes to introduce a bill that would have 'convicted homosexuals' put to death.

2) In the civil war in which Yoweri Museveni gained power child soldiers were used by his army (National Resistance Army) which is now the army of Uganda but under a different name. ([1] http://www.teachkidspeace.org/doc315.php)

3) The Ugandan army, or rather its high ranking officers have being using 'ghost soldiers' (soldiers who are no longer on the pay-roll) to siphon off funds, making the war even more profitable for them than usual, giving them a vested interest in its continuation. ([2] http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3514473.stm)

4) (kinda the same point again) War is profitable, especially for large arms economies such as the U.S. and the UK. 'U.S. Military adviser support' may as well say 'we want to US and its arms manufactures /dealers to sell the Ugandan Government shit tons more weapons'. I'm sure there's many more points that could be made, and this is still a really basic explanation that barely goes into any detail, but even a single one of these points is enough to be critical of the campaign and its support of the Ugandan army. If the campaign really wants to be truly supportive of human rights it needs to recognise that Kony is not the only war criminal, all warmongering is a crime against humanity"" Unknown

Additionally,

Of the $8.9 million in donations they spent in 2011, this is the breakdown: $1.7 million in US employee salaries $357,000 in Film costs $850,000 in Production costs $751,000 in Computer equipment $244,000 in ""professional services"" (DC lobbyists) $1.07 million in travel expenses $400,000 in yearly office rent in downtown San Diego $16,000 in Entertainment etc... Only 2.8 million (31%) made it to their charity program (which is further whittled down by local Ugandan government officials) - what do the children actually get?

Their rating on Charity Navigator is because they haven't had their financial books independently audited, and have no independent board members ...which is not a surprising given the use of cash noted above.

Imo this is all due to the guilt comlex of WW2 (look at the disney propaganda in the video..3rd reich is everywhere in the media, so in the minds, until present day). it´s why we actually are so nice and politically correct these days. you will not find more political correctness anywhere else in the world, i tell you. e.g. we´re leading in regenerative energy cause we feel we have to be a rolemodel for the rest of the world and antisemitism instantly brings up a huge public shitstorm. you can kiss your ass goodbye if you as a public person only remotely say anything that can be interpreted nationalistic. actually, which me personally finds pretty bizarre, is if you affirm that the holocaust didnt exist you go to jail. that´s right, just for affirming it. doing ""hitlergruss"" or public showing of the swastica will also get you punished.
and just to mention: bavaria is as far as i see it is not a very liked region. it´s pretty equivalent to texas: konservative rednecks.

oh yeah and this is also what i want to make clear here: at the times of nazi germany the whole fucking world was hardcore racist! remember that! look up Eugenics on wikipedia, it´s shocking. and it didnt end in the 40ies, i do not have to go deeper into that. actually at present day there is more nationalism in most countries than in germany! we eager to be the nice guys nowadays. pratriotism was nonexistent here, slowly recovering... 
fighting germany in ww2 was surely not a moral issue, it wasn´t that easy as the good buys vs the bad guys, as hollywood preaches in every fucking movie (concerning conflicts generally). it was an issue of imperialism, of power. speaking of that, looking at the colonies countries like great britian (the mother of US), france or spain have or have had in the world. they pwned pretty much whole fucking africa alone, bringing slaves to their countries. speaking of that - remember WHY you have that ""tolerant"" mixed cultures now, whereas germany has nothing alike (no colonies then -&gt; no black people nowadays).

for me, this current german attitude i see is pretty awkward. neither do i feel guilt for something way before my time, nor do i need the concept of patriotism in my world. the stereotypes still present, well, i think most americans are smarter than their reputation, but still i obviously felt i had to defend myself here. thoughts of a raging german on that, lol. jk, i´m chill ;)",0,1331144898,null,0,true,0,c3yms7j,t3_qih13,t1_c3yms7j,t1_c3xx5sg,null,1428483814,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

&gt; The US Supreme Court has held that all governments of the United States may at times terminate a contract of employment, even if that termination would serve to limit the expression of First Amendment rights of government employees, if political affiliation is pertinent to the position.

However, something called the [Pickering test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickering_v._Board_of_Education) is used when an employee/contractor feels they were unjustly fired:
&gt; The Pickering test requires that the employee must first prove that the firing decision was based on the exercise of free speech on a matter of public concern. If the employee is successful in showing that the government used the speech in the termination decision, the government may still prevail if it can show by a preponderance of the evidence that the firing decision would have been made regardless of the speech, or if the government can show that its legitimate interests outweigh the right of free speech.

It seems that if your hood making business in question could prove that their contract was terminated because the government didn't like that they also made hoods for the KKK, the contract termination would not be upheld. Therefore freedom of speech is still preserved.

Une économie c'est : l'éducation (pour permettre aux générations futures de soutenir le pays), des investissements (donc des investisseurs) et de la production (des ingénieurs et des travailleurs).

Au niveau de l'éducation, Hollande propose de rester dans le système actuel en ajoutant plus d'argent. Si tu trouve le système scolaire actuel adapté, c'est un bon point pour lui, moi je pense qu'il devrait être changé mais personne n'en a la force.

Les investissements, avec Hollande faut plutôt oublier, mais le PS est forcément adepte du libéralisme économique, donc miser l'économie sur l'artisanat et les TPE ainsi que sur les secteurs primaires et secondaires (l'agriculture et l'industrie qui se cassent la gueule en France). Ceci dit, ce sont les PME qui embauchent le plus en France, et les PME ont besoin d'investisseurs, et pour le moment il n'a rien dit qui puisse les pousser à rester en France.

Au niveau de la production, il va malheureusement proposer les solutions du PS, réduction du temps de travail (ou du moins garder les 35h), augmentation des impôts sur le revenu (les plus riches paient plus, mais les allocs des moins riches gonflent). Ce phénomène risquerai d’entraîner une fuite de cerveau assez importante, en effet les futurs cadres (les bac +5 qui viennent de sortir de l'école ou vont en sortir bientôt) sont préparés à partir à l'étranger (qui a besoin d'eux, donc est prêt à les payer) et n'ont pas envie de travailler plus que les autres, pour gagner finalement moins.

Ich habe Englisch und westernische europäische Geschichte an der Uni gestudiert (leider bedauere ich das ein wenig).  Jetzt arbeite ich als ""Forschunger"" aber alles das ich tun ist Kontaktinformationenen nachschlagen (acht Stunde pro Tag vor dem Computer! ACH!)

Was studierst du zur Zeit (an der Uni)?  

Und das ist gut!  Wir haben ziemlich ähnlich politische Ansichten!  Ich hoffe das England näher der EU werden.  Wir (die Vereinigten Staaten) haben zu viele Kontrolle über Weltangelegenheiten.  Und wir beginnen Kriege und wollen die Leute immer an Terrorismus zu denken.  Aber wir haben uns ein Ziel weil wir Israel zu viel unterstützen usw usw usw!  (Ich kann für eine Weile fortsetzen wenn du willst lol).

Obamacare?  Ich glaube das wir brauchen sozialisiert Medizin wie du in England.  Obamacare gibt zu viel zu private Krankenversicherung!  Jetzt jedermann Versicherung kaufen muss?  Wo ist die Konkurrentz da?  Jetzt haben sie keinen Grund um die Preise zu senken.  Und jedes Jahr rund 45,000 Menschen stirbt an keine Krankenversicherung.  Das liegt über zehnmal um die Menschen an 9/11 sterben haben (God my grammar sucks! lol).  Aber wir geben immer mehr für Verteidigung Kosten aus.

Germany had a democratically elected parliament since 1871 and basic civil liberties since the constitution of 1919. I call that a democracy. It wasn't functioning well in the 20s, yes, but that doesn't make it not a democracy.

&gt; It barely got off its feet moments after it appeared, and parties representing Liberal Democracy never maintained a majority position in Weimar after 1920.

That's not true. From 1871 till 1930, democratic parties had a majority in the Reichstag. Until the NSDAP became strong, the only anti-republican parties in the Reichstag were KPD (~10%) and maybe DNVP (~10%).

Number one thing to tell you is: Get in contact with a german professor at the CC. They will know what is expected before entering a level of German, and what they will teach you throughout that level. One may even be able to give you a miniquiz to test if you know XYZ rules. That way you don't start out already being in over your head.  
(In fact, I'm almost certain that you will have to take an official Entrance Exam before getting into a class like that. But at least a miniquiz would be more informal and wouldn't get your hopes up too much)

""What is included in a college language course""? I took 4 years of Spanish at high school, and a year and a half of German language classes at CC.  
By and large, I think a CC language course will be very similar to that from a HS. The biggest thing, that I mentioned above, is just that a college course is more condensed.  
I don't think I ever did the art projects for German that I did for Spanish. Same with group presentations (although I have had a couple of solo presentations).

We learned the passive voice (""You were seen"" rather than ""He saw you"") and subjunctive (""If only I could....""), but most of the time was on learning about stuff like the DDR, Berlin Wall, Reunification, Weimar Republic, Holidays or other cultural events, etc. and the vocabulary that came with all of that.

The Swiss criminal law (Strafgesetzbuch) is pretty clear - the idea is that anyone should be able to understand and access it.  Article 1 says ""nobody to be punished without breaking an explicit law""

If I understand article 31, it says that the right to raise ""Strafantrag"" (charge someone criminally) expires after 3 months of imprisonment during an investigation.

There is ""Untersuchungshaft"" (investigation imprisonment, when someone is imprisoned on suspicion of having committed a crime - max. 3 months, must be granted by a court) and ""Sicherheitshaft"" (imprisonment between filing of charges and the court case, max. 48 hours).  It also looks like the Untersuchungshaft can, in exceptional circumstances, be prolonged to 6 months by a court.  There's a whole buttload of cross-controls as well.

In short, once someone has any short of power, he/she will abuse to the point of stupidity (well, not as bad in Greece as in the middle east, but nothing like northern Europe).  With such strong abuses of power, you can't really have democracy in the western sense. Effectively one part of the population will keep voting for another part to be its slaves. 

The Greek dream of a job in the public sector (which is not that large BTW) was created because of monumental abuses in worker's rights in the private sector. You would either get a job in the public sector or slavery in the private sector. 

There is certain part of Greek society that sucks the lifeblood out of the rest, through an intricate web of government and business connections (and their stooges).  Some of the biggest beneficiaries of this system are so intertwined with the Greek State and business establishment (some local, some foreign) that makes it is impossible for them to be prosecuted. They are in power right now, and they will keep being in power for the time being.  

I doubt there is any incentive to reclaim any of the money back (assuming the fraud is that high, Greek news report a 0.5 billion per year saved by stopping payments to bogus pensioners). There has never been any prosecutions related to criminal activity from foreign (Hochtief, Siemens) corporations or local thugs in Greece and there won't be any.  Now, because the state cannot afford to bribe so many,  it might be that a lot of popular support for the current system might go away, although we have to wait and see how the middle classes feel about it. 

To make matters even worse, what EU is currently doing is aiding the abusers to the point of crushing everybody else.

A substantial number of nazis were just that - Mitläufer who'd joined opportunistically, but didn't really engage in the real active evils of the regime beyond shouting a few slogans and wearing a lapel pin.  Yes, it's morally reprehensible, but through the lens of history it's easy to judge.

I have a bit more trouble with the Stasi informants (not the leadership, but the actual people reporting on their neighbors).  First, this required active participation, and second, the consequences for opposing the SED, while still serious, were nowhere near as grave as what could be expected for dissidents under the NS-regime.  

True, the SED also wasn't nearly as bad as the Nazis, and I realize that it would have practically been impossible to prosecute or weed them all out, but at least a more transparent approach to making clear who was an informant would have been nice IMHO.

_Edit:_ Also let's not forget the really opportunistic and objectionable way in which the US (probably others, although I'm not aware of specifics) allowed Nazis to have a huge impact on military and diplomatic policy up until the 1980s because they saw them as useful tools against the Soviets (who were no better, although they usually just grabbed the scientists and put them to work).

The socialist have a very uncertain future in Hungary. Why? Because e.g. the President of the Hungarian Central Bank had a bigger salary than Bernanke in USA. The salary ceiling is valid for all public servants in Hungary, but because he is a man of the socialists, the salary ceiling could be used to build up an EU-level conflict with the government.
The socialist idiots attacked the strongest right wing government in Europe to aid their comrades in Hungary, who lost voter support at home due to their incompetence, but just made them look even worse in eyes of right wing and independent voters.  
The left-right division gets more and more apparent in Europe. Not just the attacks against Hungarian sovereignty, but the Hollande-scandal shows also, that the future of EU-politic will be defined by left versus right battle.
The EU (at the moment governed by left-liberal majority) vs. Hungarian government (right wing supermajority) conflict will further escalate, because some left-liberal dominated EU institutions think, it will break the government or reduce its support. However this is not happening, so I assume the EU-attacks will still get more aggressive.  
The latest joke is, that the EU-commission proposed to cut funds for Hungary, because the budget deficit may (!) be slightly over 3% (3,25%) in 2013 (it was below 3% in 2011 and will be below it 2012). However e.g. Spain will have this year 5,8 % deficit. What a joke :)

Yeah, that's the old continuity problem.

Yeah, if you are a big artist. Otherwise you'll probably pay more than you make. The concept of GEMA **might** be a good Idea, nothing about GEMA is.  

The biggest Problem is, that too many artists don't know about the Problems with GEMA.

By the way, if you are in the GEMA and want to have your music available for downloading on your website... you better pay the GEMA for that so they can give you most of that money back.

Et comme la taxe foncière est basée sur la valeur locative du logement, ça ne provoquera pas d'envolée des prix.

Le reste de l'argent qu'ils ""cachent"" est injecté dans l'économie, que ce soit en bourse ou en investissement direct dans des sociétés, donc s'ils paient moins d'impôt en créant des emplois ou de l'activité en général, ça ne me dérange pas tant que ça. Ce n'est pas de l'argent qui dort et c'est très bon pour l'économie, surtout dans le tertiaire qui a besoin de ces investisseurs.

Donc proportionnellement ils paient peut-être moins d’impôts (même si l'article ne mentionne pas l'imposition de l'activité engendrée par les investissements, car forcément une société qui recevra 1M€ d'investissement va payer beaucoup plus de taxes par la suite), mais participe autant à la société.",0,1331223974,null,0,false,0,c3yxzen,t3_qloen,t1_c3yxzen,t1_c3yxqeb,null,1428489235,0,false,france,t5_2qhjz,0

L'égalité homme/femme c'est pas seulement l'égalité des tâches ménagères. 

C'est l'égalité des salaires par exemple. ([27% de moins pour les femmes](http://www.inegalites.fr/spip.php?article1400), aille...)

C'est, quand on entend une femme dire des conneries on ne blâme pas sa stupidité sur son sexe.

C'est quand on ne généralise pas ""toutes les femmes font les soldes"" ou ""tous les mecs s'intéressent au foot"".

C'est quand la société ne fera plus croire aux filles qu'elles seront beaucoup mieux acceptées si elles sont belles et qu'elles se taisent, et si pour être ""intéressantes"" il faut qu'elles aient des talons de 15cm et non qu'elles soient cultivées.

C'est quand une fille pourra porter ce qu'elle veut sans se faire emmerder dans la rue. C'est quand une femme pourra avoir la vie sexuelle qu'elle voudra sans se faire traiter de salope, c'est quand on ne pensera plus ""une clé qui ouvre plusieurs cadenas est une bonne clé, un cadenas qui se fait ouvrir par plusieurs clés est un mauvais cadenas"" au sujet des comportements sexuels des hommes et des femmes.

C'est quand on arrêtera de blâmer les victimes, de viols par exemple : ""tu portais une jupe ras la moule, c'est de ta faute si un mec a mis son pénis dans ton vagin contre ta volonté"" — il faut blâmer les violeurs. 

C'est quand on arrêtera de penser que les féministes sont des mal baisées, des déçues des hommes, des gouinasses... les féministes c'est des femmes (et des hommes) qui sont pour une égalité des sexes, non en apparence (""je fais aussi le ménaaaage, je suis trop un homme moderne"") mais aussi dans les faits.
