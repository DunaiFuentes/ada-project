* Study Germany/Austria/Switzerland geography. Maybe it's a bit lame, but it's a German club, isn't it?
* Organise your own German language course. You can buy some cheap used books in Amazon, plus you can take advantage of your fluent member.
* Contact the German embassy or your nearest consulate and see if they are willing to give you some materials.
* One thing that it's easy and free it's to write letters/e-mails to the tourism bureau of any German city or village you can think of, and they will send you brochures for free. Germans love planning and this was their way of organising their (weekend) trips before the internet was here.

true,mat101010,,ex-Expat Berlin/Heidelberg,"I've moved to Germany with a dog twice now. The first dog was so good about flying; she would come with any time I spent a few months on either side of the Atlantic. The second dog is a worry wort and spends half her life hiding from her own shadow. She did the trans-Atlantic flight once and was stressed to the max upon arrival (shivering uncontrollably for hours - not cold shivering, fireworks shivering).

As everyone else said, you'll need to see a vet that can fill out the needed paperwork and get the needed shots. Don't leave this to the last minute as it took us a while to get an appointment. There's only one or two vets in each state that do this type of intl. pet transport health certification and paperwork.

User *i_am_at_work* suggested that dogs will get a tranquilizer shot before loading ... wat? ... No, the airline will just handle your pet as a live animal and give no special attention beyond providing a comfortable temperature in a pressurized cabin and refilling drinking water where possible. Some airlines (like Lufthansa) demand to be notified within 48 hours of travel if you are bringing a pet. And there is the pet fee that you'll need to pay at check-in. 

Do try and book a non-stop flight. Layovers and plane changes just make the trip longer and more complicated for you and the pet. Also, make sure you book on an airline that allows dogs in cargo. There are companies that ship dogs in case you can't share the same flight but that's a whole different issue.

From experience, I recommend spending some time and getting your dog to LOVE sleeping in its dog transport box. The last thing you want to do is stress out the pet by forcing it into some plastic box at the airport. If your dog knows and likes the box, your dog will be more at ease with the situation. 

If you're dog is stressed by separation anxiety, you may consider getting some doggy-downer pills from your vet. You'll want to try them out on your dog before the day of travel ... so you know the dog will react okay to being drowsy. Some dogs panic, some dogs shit all over themselves. I only recommend this option if your dog becomes agitated when left alone.

Some other tricks I've picked up are to lightly freeze the dog's drinking water. When the transport box gets loaded into the plane, the water often ends up sloshing out and into the bottom of the box. If you freeze it so that just the top 1/2 inch is hard, this will prevent the water from getting spilled until mid-flight. Either way, most dogs won't eat or drink during the flight anyway.

I have also looked at taking the QM2 as well but there are lots of problems. For one, the boat needs to go to Germany or France as the UK has strict rules about quarantine. And my dogs would have been just as uneasy with being in the boat's kennel for 6 days as being in a transport box for 12 hours.",0,1333269284,null,0,true,0,c478ofn,t3_rmyvt,t1_c478ofn,t3_rmyvt,null,1428634057,3,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,3

I am an ex-pat living in Germany and like I said, I'm not a dog owner but from what I've gathered, owning a dog in Germany is a big deal.  You have to pay a huge tax to buy one and get it registered...you can't just choose one out of a box at a flea market.  There are a lot of weird stipulations with dogs in Germany that we don't have in the US like when our pets die we bury them in the backyard so we can visit them often.  I'm not sure what exactly you're supposed to do with them here but it's illegal to bury them.

Old phrase: You can take a horse to water, but you can't make it drink.

Translated: People have shown no interest in perceiving themselves as 'european'.

The crucial feature of indirect democracy is the perception of
representation, the collective trust in shared aims and expectations that allows the people to put their destiny in the hands of another, safe in the knowledge that even if ‘their’ man doesn’t get the job then the other guy will still be looking after their best interests.

The manner in which this trust is built is the knowledge that you and ‘he’ have a history of cooperation, and that your respective families likewise have a shared social and cultural history of cooperation, all of which allows you to trust that when adversity strikes ‘he’ will act in a predictable and acceptable way.

A nation-state is effectively a collective agreement that a people are a family, who have sufficient trust in each other to accept indirect
governance from representatives of the prevailing will of a majority,
it is also a collective agreement to work together for the benefit of the whole rather than the individual. In short it is a marriage which results in a transfer union.",0,1333275827,null,0,false,0,c4794qd,t3_rm9nr,t1_c4794qd,t3_rm9nr,null,1428634282,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

So I'm sort of failing to see your point.

Look, Bavarians may well be substantially different in outlook, character, religion and habits than, say Berliners: but they also share quite a lot in common. I don't need to tell you how a language binds you together, especially a language not spoken much in the rest of the world in comparison to, say, English or Chinese. It seems needless to say it but I'm going to say it:

There are many dimensions of comparison. On some - say, social liberality - Berliners may be closer to Londoners than either are to rural parts of their respective countries. But the grouping by country or state, finally, weighted along certain axes or by more points of comparison isn't arbitrary or accidental.

A potato ricer is cheating but it will give you a decent approximation.

The part between Bonn and Koblenz is already awesome (I take that train every few weeks), but the upper middle rhine valley between Koblenz and Bingen (or Mainz) is absolutely stunning.

Especially the west bank train, since all the really great sights (Siebengebirge, Marksburg, Loreley, Festung Ehrenbreitstein and many more) are actually on the east side!

The best train would probably be the MRB (Mittelrheinbahn) from Cologne to Mainz.
Disadvantages: may be uncomfortable, it's a cheap regional train.
Advantage: Lots of stops, slow -&gt; more to see.

The other train would be RE (regionalexpress): faster, less stops, more comfort.
I would advise against IC (Intercity), it's simply too fast to enjoy the view imho.

Alternatively, If you have a lot of time and are not fixated on trains:
take a boat.
There are ""river cruises"" all along the middle rhine.
They have one huge advantage: they are essentially guided tours, where the captain or a guide will use the speakers on the boat to call out sights and talk about their history etc.

There are something like 40 castles along the _upper_ middle rhine valley, so a guide is quite helpful :)

Per il resto, non pensavo di scendere a parlare di me personalmente, ma posso dire che credo di conoscere abbastanza bene le mie passioni; solo che non ho interesse a seguirne gli sviluppi lavorativi o accademici. La scuola fino a questo punto mi ha disilluso riguardo alla possibilità di estendere anche all'esterno ciò che mi piace fare nel privato. Per questo pensavo di tenere certe cose per me e utilizzare il lavoro come punto di contatto con il mondo, per sostenermi e costruirmi una vita ""normale"" nel migliore dei modi.

true,twentyfumble,europe,,"Hi,

welcome to r/italy, some things for you to consider:

- Italy, like most of Europe, is in the middle of a job crisis. Not the best time to find a job, even for italians.

- I work in IT and I have colleagues from USA, UK, Netherlands, ecc. But all of them were hired more than 5 years ago, when the job situation was very different. Now being a foreigner reduces your chances of finding a job to almost zero, unless you know someone that can offer you a job or you speak a good Italian.

- Finding a job in Italy is very different from finding a job in US/UK. Most job opportunities don't go through the channels you would expect and you are used to.

- For example my company does not hire directly, it makes use of consultants from other companies. After you have been in the company for 4-5 years as a consultant and you have proven you are good, you will probably be hired.

- Many job opportunities are offered through unofficial channels. For example my old company, when it needed to hire someone, was used to ask us employees if we had a friend or an acquaintance who could fill that role.

- It's very important to build a network of relationships, friends, colleagues, you have to know a lot of people. Every single time that I changed job was because a former colleague who appreciated me from past experience offered me to move to his company.

- If you don't live in Italy, don't speak Italian and you don't know anyone, it will be really hard for you.

- Most web developers are freelancers. That would be the biggest problem for you, if you don't speak Italian you can't be a freelancer because you can't talk to your customers. If you don't speak Italian you can only work with big companies, and none of them hire directly as I explained above.

Anyway, I had my own web agency until 2002, if you are really determined to follow your dream I can give you some starting tips. For example there is a decent community of US/UK business men who live in Rome and Milan and often need web design for their projects.

1. the customs union

2. the establishing of the competition rules necessary for the functioning of the internal market

3. monetary policy for the Member States whose currency is the euro

4. the conservation of marine biological resources under the common fisheries policy
common commercial policy

Long story short she was in the same hostel room as me, and being as beautiful as she is I was immediately infatuated. After a few days of exploring a city foreign to both of us, things began to click and but I had to head back to the US for school and she had her own shit going on in France. We parted ways for the rest of summer but with the understanding that we were, as you currently are, are in a long distance relationship. 

Fast foreward three months, we realize we want to really make it work so she moves in with me in San Francisco. We lived there up until last december when I finished my bachelors and NOW we are living in southern France (most likely moving to Lille in august) until she finishes her studies.

I'm going on the basis that you are from the UK which is fantastic for you ( you lucky bastard) since you wont have to deal with half of the paper work and bullshit I had to complete. 

Not Speaking French while living in France IS NOT AN OPTION! You will not have any success professionally or socially if you do not speak the language. Its frustrating and tiring at the beginning but if you take a few basic courses and give it a bit of an effort it will come. My French is by no means perfect but I have achieved a level of being conversationally competent. Yes the younger generation does speak a bit more english than those prior but do not expect to successfully navigate life in France if you do not speak French. I cannot emphasize this point enough.

This is a country of paper work, you must have documentation for everything! I am currently going through the process ofapplying for the documentation of the French equivalency of my american diploma. Its all very obscure as to how it is decided an unclear like most things government related in France.

3. Ja, weiß ich. Pro Minute werden derzeit etwa 1.500 Minuten Videos hochgeladen. Bei einer durchschnittlichen Dauer von 2 Minuten (aus der Luft gegriffen) wären das 750 Videos, **die von YouTube sowieso umcodiert und optimiert werden**. Dabei findet übrigens auch die Überprüfung aus 1 statt.

5. Auf diesem Niveau kann keine Lösung für das Copyright-Problem gefunden werden. Auch wenn man die GEMA ablehnt - was ich tue, ich bin Pirat! - muss man anerkennen dass für geistiges Eigentum bezahlt werden muss.

Like others said, I cannot stress enough that life without learning french will be close to impossible or terribly frustrating if you choose to live outside Paris/touristy areas.

What is your degree ? Try to see if you can find equivalence of your diploma here. Comming from abroad, what do you think are your key assets that you can bring to a french company ? Try to think about British companies that you may know that have sites for sales-people or stuff like that near Lille. Worst case scenario, you can try to look for a job in Paris and take the TGV everyday, but that would be quite tiring after a while.

Think about an ""escape plan"" as well. Who knows what is going to happen in the next weeks, try to leave to yourself the possibilty that you might have to go back (I really hope this won't happen but who knows ...).

So I will begin with the driving thing. Once again you are lucky to be from the UK because as far as I undersand, you will have the right to have a translation of your english license, though be careful about that because there is a limit for the time allotted during which you can apply. To apply you just need to go to the local préfecture with all your documentaton. For myself, each state in the us has different agreements with france, and sadly for myself, california does not have an equivalency.

As far as the amount of cash you have on hand, you can live on significantly less in France than where, I have lived in the US. I dont know your living situation or your expectations so that is difficult to comment on. Something to look into is called CAF, I and my SO recieve 300€ each month from the govt to help with housing... So that is pretty cool. Housing in general is significantly cheaper than in the US, as far as where I have lived.

I think that you are definitely right that jobs can be found if you dont speak much french but you will be limited until your french improves. A big plus is that Lille is a student city and close to england so you might have more luck than in other parts of the country.

Everyday I am surprised by something here, though to generalize, I have been shocked by how inherently different the french culture is to that of the US or even the UK. I come from a country of immigrants so one can never be sure of who is american and who is not based on appearance. In France I have definitely felt like an outsider, I am the American and for now I dont see that changing any time soon, no matter the quality of my French.

2. Energy cost. The cost of energy has soared since the privatization of EDF and GDF. Paying the electricity, gas and water bill is now a big part of the monthly rent, and is a hidden cost that is usually not taken into account by the government or newspaper. Furthermore, a family needs to pay multiple cellphone subscription and an internet access. Last but not least, the constantly rising oil price makes for more expensive fuel and generally everything.

There shouldn't even be 5 Hours dedicated to foreign language study, it's not enough time dedicated to learn a language and what little we pick up in schools isn't much use.  Those hours spent during a school week would be better of used for Maths, Science or judging by the state of our children more Physical Education.

Let people who want to obtain the skills do it on there own time, but unless things have changed much since I left school, I don't think many people are leaving with much more than a few phrases and some notable words/numbers memorised. Certainly not enough to justify the time/money spent on teaching it.

Also we started a mail exchange with a Japanese school, which was pretty cool. I remember one time we drew the inside of a Japanese tee-house on the black board and held a little tee-ceremony.

When Barsebäck was closed there was suddenly a lack of power production in southernmost Sweden and during the cold winters Sweden stopped selling power to Denmark. The Danish energy authority dragged Sweden to court for discrimination.

The result was the newly established energy areas which have different prices. This drives up the price in the south since there is no significant production there any more. The Danes are happy, they can buy Swedish power again, if more expensive than it used to be, the energy producers are happy they get more money for their power.

Also, by making any one language the official one you take away a part of the EU's character as a free association of equals and add a characteristic of imperialism. Of course for practical reasons certain languages are spoken more commonly, but a far superior idea would be to instruct all school children in three languages (or more) of their choice, one of which should be a lesser-spoken language (this might be their native one). In this manner you would never be able to have a group of us together and have any one of us linguistically isolated. And it is by no means a difficult thing to be tri-lingual if you are taught properly from a young age. I'd look to the Dutch as great examples.

Regarding the notion of actual federalisation, I'm somewhat ambivalent about it happening at all, and highly scpetical of it being workable. But if it is going to happen (and I think it is worth trying, in the long run- but it isn't the end of the world if we don't), it must not be a vote and then we're one country; rather we should vote to transfer powers bit by bit, and in a reversible fashion. Over time the EU could assume more competencies and there would be no sudden shock. People could see how it worked out and get used to it (or decide it isn't for them having tried). I have no doubt that a sudden federation, even a democratic one, would spawn terrorist splinter factions who might rightly wish to be called freedom fighters.

You would need ~20€/pax/day to cover for hostel/food/beers, although it can be done cheaper if needed to. Don't be afraid of it being something of religious origin, I did it back in 2008 and I'd say less than 5% of all the people I met were actually doing it for religious beliefs.

I wouldn't do backpacking in Spain by bus (and we do not have a hitchhiking tradition really, plus it's illegal), as it's relatively expensive. It'd be cheaper to rent a car in a popular airport (Malaga/Barcelona), think ~75€/week for a tiny car. Check bus fares [here](http://www.movelia.es/). Many times it's cheaper to move around with [Ryanair](www.ryanair.com) than by bus.

Poverty seems to have this effect on people in general. With a shrinking fund pool, the different social groups find themselves competing more fiercely for their share, and an unfortunate side-effect is the increased acceptance of easy solutions advocated by xenophobic politicians. 

With regard to Greece, the issue is a complicated one. We never had the strict, and at times inhumane, immigration policy the UK has, but then again we never had a serious well thought out immigration policy, altogether. This has led to tension on the streets, with extreme right wing thugs taking matters into their own hands.

So the question becomes: Do you enact a strict immigration policy that respects the immigrants' rights and make a serious effort to assimilate the number of immigrants your society can sustainably handle, or do you keep your borders loose and let the thugs take their rage out on random people on the street?",0,1333435283,null,0,true,0,c47wkaa,t3_ro1tw,t1_c47wkaa,t1_c47d3rw,null,1428645537,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

If you really were to come here, you'd probably start as an ESL teacher... They tend to earn from 3000 to 5000 (realistically, some get more, like 9000) PLN per month, gross. After tax it's from 2500 to 4200 PLN per month. After paying rent, you won't be able to get anywhere out with these money (perhaps Egypt or Slovakia, like most Poles) and you'll need to get around in an old packed bus (when it's 0 degrees Fahrenheit outside) because you won't afford a car.

&gt; I'm sure if I booked my tickets a year before, stayed in a doss house and ate in an empty back street stinking noodle bar....I could live cheaply in Poznan. Let's see; a single room in a hostel would be say 100-130, lunch a 5 Zl sandwich, dinner a crappy meal in Sphinx (low end) 30-50Zl, smokes 11Zl...yep less than 200....40 quid......could do that in Portsmouth for 45 quid...the difference being the fags. Average studio rent's about 400 quid, Poznan 300 in a same quality place. A weekly shop in Iceland, which is the Uk's Biedronka...roughly the same. A B and B in Portsmouth is 25 quid.....and that's a better room that the Lech or the Polonez. Kids' stuff costs way more in Poland. LCD TV's cost way more in Poland. Furniture costs way more in Poland. Clothes cost way more in Poland, unless you are shopping in the Wilda market...actually shell suits aren't my thing. Yep, you can get a 4Zl beer if you look around...you can in Wetherspoon's. Like with like right? Second hand motors are way cheaper in the UK. The hostel next to the station in Zoo (Berlin) is cheaper than the ones I've stayed in in Poznan.

I don't really feel it needs to mention Bloody Sunday, this isn't a peice designed to break down a history of the troubles, this is one man's tale of his role as a ""spy"" and the brutality used by such spy's sanctioned by the British Intelligence Agency's.

&gt;The article goes on to glorify the brutish tactics of the British Intelligence 

I don't think the story was glorified.

&gt;when they never even tried to extend an olive branch, not legislatively or rhetorically, to the Catholic movements

You don't negotiate with terrorists on their terms.

&gt;It's a classic example of imperialist absolutist policy gone awry and is being repeated in Israel, Afghanistan and Iraq today, and this is being taken as an example of success

If the British were doing half as good a job as the British did in Northern Ireland in the late 80s and 90s there might actually be hope. (I suspect we're going to disagree on this one)

&gt;but had the British learned from India, thousands of lives could have been saved

I'm not really sure to what you're referring to here, do you mean the partition of India into India and East / West Pakistan? That happened long after Northern Ireland was created. I suspect I'm missing something here sorry.

You have to remember this article is only telling one man's experience of the troubles, a brutal experience that doesn't paint either side in a good light. I don't think it's feasible for every piece discussing the troubles to contain the massive amount of background information needed to have a appropriate knowledge to frame it in.

So, if you want to rent, you can do it with 2 differents ways : 

- **""privately"" (directly with a landlord)**

*pro* : it doesn't cost too much, you avoid fee agency

*cons* : you have to be lucky enough to find an honest landlord, and all the photo/description could differ from the reality 

*Some example* (just a google search ""annonce immobilière particulier strasbourg"") (you can notice that even in that kind of website, there is some agency) : 

- [de particulier à particulier](http://www.pap.fr/annonce/locations-appartement-strasbourg-67000-g34457)
- [prêt à louer](http://www.pretalouer.fr/immobilier/location-particulier-strasbourg_0_29542_65.html)
- [pas d'agence](http://www.pasdagence.com/public/location-strasbourg-alsace.html)
- [iookaz](http://www.iookaz.com/Recherche/Immobilier/Alsace)
- [vivastreet](http://strasbourg.vivastreet.fr/annonces-location-appartement+strasbourg)
- there is a lot of other website, sorry, I can't list all of them.


And the other way :

- **with an ""estate agency""** (agence immobilière)

*Pro* : you can send a mail, have a customized search (depending on your wish), an adviser, etc

*cons* : you have to pay ~one month (generally 400-800€) of agency fee ; there is no ""great deal"", the most of it are at the market price (or a little more) ; all agency aren't the same, some of them are great (good counselling), but some aren't (try to defraud you)

*Some example* (you can have other result with googling ""agence immobilière strabourg"") :

- [logic immo](http://www.logic-immo.com/location-immobilier-strasbourg-tous-codes-postaux,382_99-c200000000-0,0-0,0-0,0-00-00-000000000000-00-0-0-1-1-0-1.html)

If you need any help/information/advice, feel free to answers/mp me :) In your situation, I believe the second option is less risky.

I know it would be better to tell you ""go here, or here"", but I don't have many experience (only 2 different place, all by word of mouth).


**Warning** : You don't have to pay to have access to a catalogue in agency.

I was trying to learn French several times and I am really, really put off by the extremely non-phonetic and irregular pronounciation. English has its fair share of issues with that too (fuck ""Leicester""), but French is even worse. I simply cannot use my favorite introverted method of learning from written materials, as I have no idea how a word is pronounced, I figure I need to get a teacher and learn to pronounce it and speak it first. Which I don't want to. In no other languages I have seen such a huge difference between orthography and pronounciation.

true,helios_the_powerful,null,null,"Oui, mais les ressources manquantes et la complexité du système font en sorte que ce n,est pas ce qui arrive.

Au Québec du moins, il y a une grave pénurie de médecins de famille (généralistes de première ligne, par qui on devrait normalement passer pour obtenir tous nos services), ce qui fait en sorte qu'on doive consulter dans des cliniques sans rendez-vous qui prennent tout le monde et où on ne voit jamais le même docteur. Il est impossible de revoir le même docteur une deuxième fois si on y retourne (sauf par chance). 

Donc, si le médecin croit déceler qqch qui nécessite des tests pour être détecté, il te réfère à un laboratoire ou un spécialiste. Le labo, c'est rapide, il renvoie les test au médecin. Toutefois, le médecin ne rappellera pas sauf si il y a quelque chose de concluant. Donc si le test n'est pas concluant, il n'y a pas de suivi, on doit se représenter dans un délai à notre discrétion pour un suivi et expliquer notre situation (à un médecin différent, c'est du sans rendez-vous).

Si le test n'est pas une prise de sang ou d'urine ou autre, mais plutôt un scan, là il faut passer par un médecin spécialiste. Il est impossible de consulter un spécialiste sans une prescription d'un généraliste. Or, il faut soi-même trouver un spécialiste et obtenir un rendez-vous. Les spécialiste les plus accessibles comme les gastro-entérologues vous donneront un rendez-vous dans 6 à 12 mois. Les dermatologue ou ophtalmologues vous diront de rappeler dans 1 ans pour un rendez-vous un an plus tard (je n'exagère pas, mon conjoint attend un rendez-vous depuis plus de 1 an et demi). Et c'est sans compter le fait que les scan, il n'y en a pas tant de ces machines. Et si c'est une biopsie, il faut un chirurgien et ceux-ci ne travaillent que des demi-journées une semaine sur deux parce qu'on ne leur alloue pas le budget pour en faire plus.

Par la suite, le spécialiste pourra prendre le tout en charge, mais normalement ce serait un généraliste qui serait en charge du tout. Or, comme il n'y a pas de généraliste, si le problème n'est pas dans le champ précis du spécialiste, on devra retourner au sans rendez-vous, tenter d'expliquer en l'absence du dossier car les médecins ne les partagent pas, obtenir un rendez-vous chez un autre spécialiste, etc.

Bien sûr, la situation est différente quand on a un médecin de famille qui peut tout gérer. Malheureusement, les jeunes n'en ont que rarement et ces médecins sont souvent près de la retraite sans remplaçant car les jeunes médecins sont attirés vers les domaines plus payant en spécialité (un généraliste gagne un peu moins de 200 000$ alors qu'un radiologe atteint très rapidement 700 000$). 

La situation est différente en France. Il y a un an, pendant que j'attendais au Québec qu'on découvre ce que j'avais à l'estomac, mon conjoint qui était en échange étudiant en France a fait quelque chose de semblable. Il est allé au sans rendez-vous et trois semaines plus tard il avait rencontré un gastro-entérologue deux fois et on avait découvert le problème. Moi j'attend encore mon rendez-vous avec le gastro dans 1 mois.

For instance, I stayed with an American couple near Frankfurt that teaches at a private school for kids of parents that speak english. The whole school is run in english.  The guy teaches german and his wife teaches english (literature, not how to speak english), but she didn't really speak a lick of german when I visited them in 07. I think she does a little more now, but still. 

I also have a german friend that lives in Mannheim and works in the marketing dept for a german company, Evonik. His departement is made up of all foreigners that speak terrible english, yet they do the bulk of their work in english.  I have a feeling that a native english speaker with a marketing degree could fit in there perfectly fine.
