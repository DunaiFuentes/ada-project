true,darelight,,Muhackl,"Okay, you want to travel around for a week?
That's very much to plan, and really not easy.
As the others said, you have to be a bit more specific.

To give you a start; how about a round-travel clockwise through germany?

Just with a look on google maps, this is what comes to my mind:
- First day: Go to Bremen early, afterwards to Bremerhaven and see the North Sea. Sleep there.
- Second day: Train to Hamburg. Visit the city, go to the ""Lion King"" musical on the evening.
- Third day: Train to Berlin. City sight-seeing, maybe some sights in the area around. No Idea of sightst atm
- Fourth day: Cologne or Leipizg (or sights near)
- Fifth day: Munich
- Sixth day: Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Allgäu, whatever. See Neuschwanstein or Hohenschwangau.
- Seventh day: Maybe Konstanz? Or Passau - it's very nice, too.

7 days are really not much, so many cities or areas to visit. Just a suggestion, I think in the cities I listed you can find enough to do for a day, also an accommodation",0,1330527235,null,0,false,0,c3w7xhq,t3_qb9dg,t1_c3w7xhq,t3_qb9dg,null,1428441706,2,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,2

Actually, I think an analogy between Central and South American people living in the US and Turkish people living in Germany would also be interesting--both in the similarities and the differences between the two situations.  However, it would also be be very enlightening to compare the situation hispanics face with the situation that the Irish, Italian, Greek, Jewish, various eastern European ethnicities, and, yes, German immigrants faced in the US.  That's not to praise American society for being especially open.  There are xenophobic bigots and racist assholes everywhere, and the situation with hispanics could go south rather quickly.  The same is true of the Turks in Germany.  However, there are a few important cultural similarities between Latin Americans and US-Americans.  One example is that Christianity is the predominant religion of both groups.  This isn't true of the Turks in Germany.  That's a start for you.

I don't think I ever directly compared the situation faced by the Turks in Germany with that of the blacks in the US.  But it would be relevant to frame the problem of race relations in the US if someone were moving from Germany to the US.  And especially if they **specifically asked** about it.

I assert that you are wrong in your assumption.  However, the only way to solve this argument would be for you to read the book with an open mind.  It is actually very well written, and is not the moral brow-beating that I assume you expect.  However, I don't expect to.

To counter your assertion that this period of history doesn't have any bearing on modern Germany, consider that a number of Jews played an important role in writing the first (failed) German constitution after the revolution of 1848.  The constitution of the Weimar republic was modeled in large part on this document as is the current German constitution.  This is just one example.

Again, I find it puzzling that many Germans feel that they are disconnected from their pre-WWII history.  Americans are often accused of ignoring history prior to the American revolution and of minimizing the effect of Anglo-Saxon culture on American culture.  Isn't this essentially the same thing?

Also, reading about Victorian England or Napoleonic France would considerably enrich living in either of these places.

All that said, there are some truths that need to be acknowledged: 

1) Greece will, drastically, have to lower it's deficit. (for the details, see point 3). Equally important, Greece will need structural reforms. They will hurt a lot of people, I'm sure, but if done fairly, they will hurt everybody equally. (if you think the reforms are done *unfairly* now, see again point 3)

2) Other EU countries will continue giving money to Greece, because we're not fucking barbarians. It will be enough for Greece to survive, but not enough for the ""best case scenario"" you hope for, where you are can default **and** stay in the Euro. 

3) How Greece plans to reduce its deficit and implement the necessary structural reforms is mainly up to the Greek themselves. You hate what your current government does? Elect a new one! But don't be childish and vote for some unrealistic party again, one that promises you a painless solution. Every government you could rationally vote for has to understand and admit that the near future will be tough for everybody.

From [another article](http://setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/features/2012/02/29/feature-01):

&gt;*Radisa Dragojevic, president of the Vlach National Council in Serbia, told the Serbian media that Romania should not apply pressure on Serbia because of the Vlach community. ""Firstly, we do not feel threatened in Serbia, and secondly, we don't feel like Romanians, but like Vlachs,"" said Dragojevic, who is also the president of the municipality of Petrovac na Mlavi, where he was elected as a Socialist Party of Serbia candidate.*

&gt;*Pedrag Balasevic, president of the Vlach Democratic Party of Serbia, says that the Vlachs are an autonomous people in the Balkans who speak two dialects of the Romanian language. ""However, the central question is not whether Vlachs are Romanians or not, but rather which rights we have in Serbia,"" Balasevic told SETimes. He says that the Vlachs do not have education in their mother tongue, or the right to religion in their language. ""Those responsible for this are the people from the Vlach National Council who believe Vlachs are Serbs and that they should write in Cyrillic. They are mostly under the influence of the ruling parties in Serbia. Nowhere else do people of Romanian origin write in Cyrillic,"" Balasevic said.*

The question of whether Vlachs are Romanians that are being „de-nationalized”, or a different ethnicity, that speaks a similar Romance language but writes in the Cyrillic script is causing anxiety among some Romanians, who see it as something very similar to the „[Moldavian ethnicity/language question](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moldovans)”.

I don't care how well written the book is, or how it isn't morally brow- beating. Because that is not the point!
The point is that the history before the holocaust is not that important for understanding contemporary Germany. It is, however, important to understand the holocaust and the way up to it. And before you start of course everything is interconnected, but Germany has a very long history. And I think learning about a new country should start with what makes it tick now. If he understands the last 60 years better, he can go back as much as he wants. 

Please understand, that we aren't talking about an history mayor, we are talking about someone who is moving to Germany. Reading about things that happened before the second World War, won't be helpful at all for him. 
And reading about Napoleon and Victorian England won't be much help in moving to France/UK either.

true,[deleted],null,null,"You give me too much credit, I'm afraid, but I'll try to answer based on my personal believes. There's a good chance, though, you'll find the answer unsatisfying. **I** find it unsatisfying sometimes. But here it goes.

I'm going to answer from the perspective of how the system should work in principle. I know, in reality, there are problems (corrupt politicians, asshole policemen, lazy people that don't work but want money anyway), but those are individual problems that can be corrected, I believe, and don't discredit the whole system.

I believe it would certainly be *individually* unfair that a hard-working factory worker earns less than some lazy banker, **but**, if the system works, the ""lazy banker"" should be an exception, not the rule. And then the real question becomes: why should a hard-working factory worker earn less than hard-working banker. And the answer to that question is: it might still be individually unfair, because why should someone earn more just because he has a college degree or is better at math, but on the level of a society, it is better that way, I believe, because on average, we all benefit from this.

Why? An example: ideally, a good finance worker, is not the ""evil banker"" he is portrayed as. If he is really good at his work, and works in a country with little or no corruption, he could, for example, provide funds for the creation of new businesses. I'm being vague here, but in principle, that's why we need the finance industry. Now, in reality, large parts of the finance industry *suck* and should be reformed, but at the core, we need the instruments they provide. Because without it, we would still be on some pre-modern level of industrialization, and while that might sound romantic and all, on average, people were much much poorer back then. 

Really, that's something everyone seems to forget all the time: yes, the rich got richer and all, but on average, we *all* got richer in the past 20, 50, 100 years. This can be quantified (calculate how many hours, on average, you have to work to buy 1kg of meat, bread, a TV, etc.), and you can see that all of society gained wealth. It's just that some gained more wealth than others, and that feels unfair.

(I'm sorry my answer is so long)

I need to make one thing clear, as a premise: Most people, whether they are politically left or right, are *materialists*, i.e. they believe it is generally good to ""produce and own many valuable things"". If you don't agree to that premise, if you think it would be better if we were more inclined to reach happiness through philosophical thought or something like that (and many smart people probably think that), then my whole argument breaks down. But if you *do* believe that gathering wealth is a good goal for a society, then some level of individual ""unfairness"" is tolerable, and perhaps necessary, because on the larger level of the whole society, total wealth increases.

Finally, one more speculative thought: I live in the Netherlands at the moment. I've had some discussion with Dutch, Greeks and Italians, and we often seem to disagree about what we think about governments *in general*. I sometimes think that maybe the political situation in Greece or (Berlusconi) Italy is/was fundamentally  different from the situation of countries like Germany or the Netherlands. I don't support everything the government here does, but in general, they are at least trying to do a good job. Maybe, the current political situation in Greek makes it almost impossible to accept what your government does. Or in other words: your government has been corrupt for a long time (please correct me if I'm wrong about that), and it seems all alternative politicians are corrupt as well, so you assume *all* governments around the world must be corrupt. Like I said, I don't want to idealize the Dutch government, they make many stupid decisions, but so does everybody. But generally, they're trying to do the right thing.",0,1330539324,null,0,true,0,c3wa514,t3_q8029,t1_c3wa514,t1_c3w9qmb,null,1428442479,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Well, no, let's not just stick to voting.  You, in your first blustering post in this thread of comments, described voting as a ""fundamental right"".  Britons rightly characterise voting as a wholly different right than the right to life or free assembly, rights that people are born with simply due to the fact that they are human.

Voting clearly is some different form of right, not least because it requires a social construct to already be in place, a democratic system, to even make sense, and because the ""right"" to vote is contingent on a whole load of things, not least nationality, citizenship status, age, and mental faculty.  As a result, it's an abuse of language to characterise voting as a ""fundamental right"" in the same way that the right to life is, and the idiotic ruling itself has done more damage to the ECHR in the UK than a Tory electoral victory, or a Daily Mail campaign, ever will.

Well yes there is and I've already presented you with one reason. Now you can chpoose to ignore it if you wish because it's rather inconvenient to you but it's a bit silly to claim there is 'no reason', isn't it. Perhaps you mean there's no reason you agree with, even though you can't think up a reason why not just at the moment so you'll igore it?

Let me go through some for you:

 * It would be inappropriate for people who have offended against the law in such a serious way that we find it necessary to deprive them of the fundamental right to liberty, to help decide who should be proposing and passing laws in government.

 * Depriving people temporarily of the right to vote is a proportionate way of indicating to a criminal that they have so offended against society that they shall for a period be semi-detached from that society.

 * If a serious criminal has decided not to cooperate with society, we shall not cooperate with him, either.

we are currently facing a really bad situation with vodafone/de; my gf signed a vodafone contract in senftenberg on dec/2009 for the internet connection &amp; landline phone services; this contract expired on dec/2011 and coincidentally, we were about to move to dresden on jan/2012; so we went to local senftenberg vodafone store and asked for options; the guy told as to safely move the connection to another place and also told us, we will be able to cancel the contract when the services will not be satisfactory... so we did. i accent, that was the only thing, we were said.

as we moved to dresden, we found out, our street has really poor vodafone internet connection (i can get at most 2.5Mbit of it, while contract says 6000 (6000kbit i suppose)); THEN, we found out, you need to cancel the contract 3 months prior of expiration and if you fail to do so, it is automatically prolonged for 12 months (that is, dec/2012); which really made us angry, as we explicitly wanted iptv and good internet connection (as i work over the net);... as we wrote written cancellation, just today, we've received letter stating, our cancellation is possible on feb/2014, because contract was automatically prolonged for 24 months as we changed the address... nobody told us. and right now, we were just told to try to write another cancellation letter.

so, STAY AWAY OF VODAFONE AND READ, READ ALL THE FINE PRINT here in germany and REMEMBER what have you read for the whole time of your contract, because it seems, they WILL use it against you if possible.

More balanced allocation of over liquidity could have also balanced out the downturn as it did in Germany with the help of the government.

 They came to Serbia (or returned depending on history sources) before Alexandru Ioan Cuza created Romania, and after that every contact stopped.

This was your response to someone's question about why it was acceptable to deny a given right (voting): ""You deny them many 'rights' by locking them up. You've already accepted that.""

Your response applies equally well to the right not to be tortured as it does to the right to vote.

&gt; If a criminal has proven himself, through his breaking the law, to be so beyond the pale that we find it necessary to deprive him of his liberty; then we do not wish him to participate in electing people who make the laws he abuses.

Sometimes we have bad laws. In many countries people have been put in prison for violating laws mandating inferior treatment for certain races.

As I mentioned elsewhere, there's very little chance of the prison population overcoming the non-prisoner population's wishes in the polls. However, I do think it reasonable that they have a voice. The prisoner who votes for a politician who wants to legalize murder is probably not going to have any impact in the outcome of the election.
