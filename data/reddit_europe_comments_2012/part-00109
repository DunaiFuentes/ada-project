Uh-oh. Here's what Wikipedia says: The Kingdom of Hungary existed for 946 years, and at various points **was regarded as one of the cultural centres of the Western world**.  
Examples: Hungary was the first European country after the Italian states to adopt Renaissance views, practices, art, etc. The country was a very early adopter of the printing press. The Hungarian Diet has an illustrous parliamentary history and the Golden Bull of 1222, possibly influenced by and in many points similar to the Magna Carta, is one of Europes oldest constitutional documents - and remarkable, as it basically puts the king under the rule of law, freeing his subjects from obedience if he acts counter to it.  
Hungary was also long a bulwark against Ottoman expansion into Western Europe. In fact, british historian [Macaulay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Babington_Macaulay,_1st_Baron_Macaulay) argued that had the Hungarians not stopped the Turks, ""the Koran would now be thought at Oxford"" (i.e. Europe would be Muslim now - and the Americas probably too, Hungary's crucial resistance having happened before the discovery of the New World).

true,fane123,ROMA,Romanian in Europe,"Where in my post am I **implicitly** defending racial violence?  I was trying to explain the situation to people , like you, who have a solution without knowing the problem.  Racial violence is a crime in Romania, just like any other violence. Somebody attacking a gipsy, or Roma( not Romani, though), is treated just like somebody attacking a Romanian.  The only racist bit is that we don't make it a *special* case. 

Also, on the integration of gipsies in Romanian society it is good to remember, besides the many failed attempts, besides the fact that they speak their own language and *choose* to live in their isolated communities, besides the fact that is an insult to a gipsy living in Romania to be called Romanian, they are 2 millions people in a country of 18 millions. It would not be impossible for them to have a big say in how the country is govern if they would bother to vote and give a shit about the country they live in.

That being said, I do believe there is racism in Eastern Europe against the gipsies and I do not approve the far right approach. The thing is we have a vicious circle going which is hard to break. Nobody will hire a gipsy because he will rob you, so gipsies have to rely on stealing to get by. While better education seems the only possible way out is very hard to integrate someone who outright refuses to cooperate. Education in Romania is free up to higschool ( first 12 years of school) and there are lots of state sponsored university places for Roma ethnic people on all universities. The first 8 years of school are mandatory yet as much as 75% of gipsy children will only go for 2-3 years, because parents pull them out to teach them begging and stealing, which they need later on. It is a common thing in Romania to be harassed by gipsy begging children wherever you go. A sight that is more and more common in western Europe as well this days. This combined with the gipsy tradition of getting married at the age of 12-15 yo, results in an almost impossible struggle of educating a group that is happy to be uneducated.

And for those who will decide to defend the ancient gipsy tradition and way of life , some common occurrences in gipsy communities are child abuse, maiming of children in order to become better beggars ( includes breaking of legs and twisting the around, cutting limbs, blinding etc, performed on their own children) , selling children for electronic goods( TVs, stereos etc) even to shaddy people connected to human organ trafficking and many other good things.",0,1345277398,null,0,1345278539,0,c5uzhoi,t3_ye07n,t1_c5uzhoi,t1_c5ux85d,null,1429670383,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

Andererseits scheint mir die entsprechende (übrigens noch nicht beendete) Rechtsprechung des Verfassungsgerichtes durchaus den Vorgaben von Art. 87a 4) GG zu folgen und damit den Grundsätzen deutschen Rechts, die auch schon während des Kalten Krieges galten. Insgesamt sehe ich da schon Regelungsbedarf, denn es gilt  Rechtssicherheit zu schaffen und in Teilen veraltetes Recht der Gegenwart anzupassen. Die im Moment diskutierten Szenarien sind Grauzonen, in denen es keine klaren Kompetenzen gibt. (Einen ähnlichen Fall hatten wir schon einmal vor einiger Zeit, als sich Polizei und Armee nicht einigen konnten, wer denn jetzt für die Befreiung von Geiseln im Ausland zuständig wäre. Dabei wurde nicht nur wertvolle Zeit verschwendet, man hat sich auch noch vor den Augen der Welt, in diesem Fall der Amerikaner, die das Schiff für die Operation gestellt haben oder besser hätten, lächerlich gemacht.) 

Ich glaube, dass wesentliche Problem ist, dass niemand sich bisher sachlich vor Augen geführt hat, wovon man hier redet. Wir reden nicht davon, dass sich ein Fallschirmjägerbataillon rund um das Regierungsviertel zur Verteidigung einrichtet (sowas kann die Polizei in ""ähnlicher"" Weise selbst). Wir reden davon, dass ein Schiff der Bundesmarine oder Jagdflieger der Luftwaffe zum Einsatz kommen, weil sie Fähigkeiten abbilden, die die Polizei nicht hat. Das Air-Policing wurde ja schon immer von der Luftwaffe gemacht. Das (gemeint sind unterstützende Tätigkeiten, die den Einsatz von militärspezifischen Mitteln einschließen) ist aber im Moment nicht ohne weiteres überall möglich, deswegen der Regelungsbedarf.

Der Unterschied zum V-Fall liegt in der Verhältnismäßigkeit und der Wortwahl des GG. Egal was Terroristen tun, selbst wenn sie eine Atombombe zum Einsatz bringen könnten (in dem Fall wäre aber vermutlich eh jede bestehende Ordnung aufgehoben), sie können alleine nicht die Schwellen des GG zum V-Fall überschreiten. Das liegt daran, dass Terroranschläge nur vereinzelt und unzusammenhängend stattfinden, der V-Fall sich aber auf einen klassischen Krieg im völkerrechtlichen Sinne bezieht. Zudem muss der V-Fall erst beschlossen werden und geht dann mit besonderen Konsequenzen (Übergang der Befehls- und Kommandogewalt etc.) einher. Dies alles kostet wieder Zeit und die hat man in den angenommen Situationen nicht.

Zu den Punkten Parallelwelt (sowie Sinn und Unsinn dabei) und rechtliche Stellung von Terroristen (das Thema ist nun wirklich zu komplex und völlig umstritten) äußere ich mich jetzt mal nicht, das würde zu weit führen. Gerade letzteres ist aber ein gutes Beispiel dafür, dass Recht von Zeit zu Zeit reformiert werden muss.

&gt;Do its supporters believe kicking other ethnicities besides their own out of Europe will help solve the crisis in a meaningful way with a constructive outcome?

One of the issues is that unemployment is very high in many countries (and within those countries, in certain regions it is much worse than others), and that the welfare programs to support those who are out of work and undergoing economic hardship are being stretched by the large increase in those needing its support.

It is a natural ""us"" and ""them"" response to feel you need to protect ""our"" jobs and ""our"" welfare system"" from the mostly poor, recent migrants (that compete for jobs and welfare) who appear very different to ""us"", and therefore you do not identify with them. 

Add in news sensationalism about the crimes commited by immigrants, and it is very easy for someone who; can't get a job, is being excluded from stricter limits on welfare support, and knows (or is) a victim of a crime that is blamed on immigrants, to resent immigrants and wish for them to be removed

Yeah, because overpopulation would surely be good for quality of life. The problem gypsies having 6 kids, not majority having 2-3 kids.

1. do not pay them any benefits for having children. Overpopulation due to government money subsidising procreation is a big problem among the roma. Only tax breaks for children, and for 3 at most. Also offer sterilizations for money to those having 3+ children and longterm unemployment. Call me a nazi, but I believe right of the children to have an acceptable quality of life is more important than right of the people to procreate. And accepting sterilisation for meny would still be voluntary.

2. Everyone who receives any unemployment benefits for longer period of time must work part-time in public works (which are always available and dont depend on private employers) or lose them. Everyone who has children (which is everyone in roma camps ;) ) would lose all benefits if not sending their children to school (taking children away is not the solution, they will just make more. they need to keep them, but lose all money, if they dont care about them).

&gt;Do its supporters believe other ethnicities besides their own are to blame for the current crisis?

Bankers and governments are to blame for the crisis, not specific ethnicities.

&gt;Do its supporters believe kicking other ethnicities besides their own out of Europe will help solve the crisis in a meaningful way with a constructive outcome?

I dont think kicking them out would be good (except those who are here illegaly), but restricting immigration would surely help mitigate the bad effects of the crisis - if unemployment is high, you simply dont need more hardly employable people. If government finances are struggling, you dont need higher crime rate that comes with immigration.

I believe immigration quotas should be tied to unemployment rate - the higher unemployment, the lower the quotas. Its only logical.

&gt;Are its supporters exploiting the crisis to put forward an ethnic agenda that has always been there but hadn't had the right momentum in recent times?

Yup, anti-islamization agenda benefited from the crisis. More people started questioning current multiculturalism policy.

&gt;Do its supporters believe only enslavement and/or killing of other ethnicities besides their own will achieve this ethnic agenda?

Not me.

&gt;Or is the perception of the recent escalation of racism and xenophobia in Europe just confirmation bias?

No. People are naturally more xenophobic or anti-immigration in crisis. And while many people consider this a bad thing, I think its normal and logical response to worsening conditions - why would you want to spend money and resources for helping poor foreigners when your own people struggle in the first place? The problem is the politicians mistake protecting your own with hating the others.

true,StupidQuestionsRedux,null,null,"&gt; The speeches began with Jobbik MP Gábor Ferenczi’s. Ferenczi said that they want peace, order and safety in Devecser, and that this demonstration is about rightful Hungarian self-defense, so that the Hungarian could defend themselves and the gypsies would assume their obligations.
  

&gt;  Ferenczi “urged the mayor not to direct his words against **‘normal’ Hungarians but to stand up against the ‘criminals’ instead.** Ferenczi also said that he wants to hear no more complaints, and especially nothing further about the gypsies of Devecser stealing and cheating. **In case there were any trouble, he instructed people to call in the Defense Force [Védero, a paramilitary organization also involved in the occupation of Gyöngyöspata last year].**

&gt; Next up was László Toroczkai of Sixty-Four Counties [a person many times alleged with, though never convicted of, terrorist acts]. He started out his speech by saying that Hungarians have three possibilities. One is to immigrate, **another is to become slaves – ‘of the gypsies’ – or to stay here and fight, in which case those who are bothered by Hungarianness must leave. He said that there are gypsies and gypsy criminality all over the country, and ‘wherever this ethnic group is present, destruction and devastation shows up.’ According to him, the gypsies want to exterminate the Hungarians and if they want to fight, then one must take up the fight against them, there is no other possibility. He also added that Hungarians either become victims or they fight back.**


&gt; After this, Attila László of the For a Better Future Civil Guard Association [a demonstration by this group marked the start of a lengthy period of ethnic tensions in Gyöngyöspata last year] was given the microphone. **“All the trash must be swept out of the country,”** he said in opening. 

&gt; According to him, **one must rebel and chase away all the criminals and one must organize in every community – for this task, every “militant Hungarian” will be needed**. In conclusion, he defined self-defense as “an instinct that comes to formulation during emergencies and which is then followed up by conscious action.”


&gt; At this point, another series of speeches began, first by Zsolt Tyirityán of Betyársereg (Outlaw Army), who spoke of racial warfare and ethnic cleansings. **“The gypsy is coded in such a way that criminality is in him,”** he said. For proper effect, he also added that it is the “zionists” who direct them to go up against the laws. **“I consider myself a racist,”** Tyirityán said, **“and I am going to stand up for the cause of not letting our life-space over to an ulterior race.”** **“The genetically coded trash must be exterminated from public life.”** **“We are going to stamp out this phenomenon, it must be extirpated from our lives.”**


&gt; **“What do you think, according to you, are there signs of a racial war in this country?”** – asks the speaker from the crowd (Zsolt Tyirityánof the Outlaw Army).
&gt; “Yes!” yells the crowd back at him.
&gt; **“According to you, based on race or ethnicity, is there going to be an escalation to a conflict?”**
&gt; “Yes!”
&gt; “So then let’s send a message to them!”

* Not entirely. Almost all of the problems in Europe are caused by Europeans.

Obviously this effect is very small compared to that of corruption within the financial system, but I feel it's still worth mentioning. Also, stop support for Israel/Palestine. Let's worry about our own problems for now.   

* No. Unless they're proselytizing for any religion, or they're religious extremists. If they can't be kicked out due to citizenship, then institutionalization is in order.   

* They don't have to. With a shortage of jobs, and a shortage of public funds, the locals of a region don't want to have to compete even harder for jobs with people who might not even have work visas. One reason we have countries is to maintain solidarity, so that we can lift each other up, rather than have to sacrifice ourselves for the benefit of people who climbed over a fence.

true,Alphaiv,ENGL,England,"&gt;Is the crisis the driving force behind racism and xenophobia in Europe?

I think its undoubtedly one of the driving forces but I think that the increase in immigrants is the main factor. This might just be my perception but I think xenophobia was increasing in the UK for quite a while before the crisis began as well as frustration at politicians' unwillingness to address the issue of immigration; the crisis just provided a flashpoint for these feelings to materialise into movements like the EDL where previously people were scared of being labelled racist if they expressed their views.

I also think that racism and xenophobia tends to be more prevalent in more multiracial and multicultural areas. For example, and again this is just my perception, but it seems like Romania faced heavy criticism for its treatment of its gypsy population and then when Romania joined the EU and gypsy immigration to western european countries increased then suddenly hating gypsies became acceptable (as long as you hate their culture not their race).

&gt;Do its supporters believe other ethnicities besides their own are to blame for the current crisis?

&gt;Do its supporters believe kicking other ethnicities besides their own out of Europe will help solve the crisis in a meaningful way with a constructive outcome?

If 'to blame' means that they are the root cause of the crisis then of course not, the crisis is so complicated that it can't be said to have a root cause. If you mean that they are one factor then yes I think that a large number of immigrants are a burden on European economies and welfare systems, for example Polish immigrants to the UK might annoy people in certain professions where they drive down the average wage but in general Polish immigrants are hard working and contribute to the UK economy however asylum seekers and illegal immigrants from 3rd world countries are usually a net negative to the UK. I remember reading a study a while back that showed that 17% of people born in the UK were in social housing, compared to 6% for Polish born and 80% for Somali born.

&gt;Or is the crisis rather the driving excuse behind racism and xenophobia in Europe?

Not really, im sure that there are people who are trying to exploit the crisis but it seems to me that most of the racism and xenophobia is a natural backlash against mass immigration and its effects. Furthermore I haven't seen anyone advocate the enslavement or killing of immigrants; the only group with beliefs anywhere close would be the BNP who favour paying immigrants to return to their home countries and they haven't seen any real increase in support.

&gt;Or is the perception of the recent escalation of racism and xenophobia in Europe just confirmation bias?

true,Myuym,NETH,The Netherlands,"&gt;Is the crisis the driving force behind racism and xenophobia in Europe?

No the crisis is not the driving force behind the racism and xenophobia in Europe, In the Netherlands it started way before the crisis. It was an effect of the politicians declaring bad behavior of immigrants a taboo. While the immigrants kept abusing us/our system the public got fed up with it. This can be seen as a reaction to weak politics by the government that the immigrants were all seen as pitiful and therefore we couldn't do anything to them, because they were so pitiful you were a racist if you even mentioned that they were cause of most crimes.  



&gt;Do its supporters believe other ethnicities besides their own are to blame for the current crisis?

No the banks/governments are to blame for the crisis, for the xenophobia in the Netherlands the ethnicities that are to ""blame"" (are the cause of) are mostly the criminal groups, that means there is more xenophobia towards Moroccans, Antilleans, africans and middle eastern 
groups, Maybe some xenophobia towards CEE countries like Romania and Bulgaria. And as crimes are mostly the reasons for the hate I think most Asians are not disliked, because they work hard, do way less crime then other ethnic groups and are a valuable addition to our society, of other ethnic groups that isn't always the case.



&gt;Do its supporters believe kicking other ethnicities besides their own out of Europe will help solve the crisis in a meaningful way with a constructive outcome?

I doubt that supporters will think it helps to kick them out. 
But want to kick them out anyway. The crisis can just be seen as an excuse to remove unsavory elements out of society. or in the best possible case out of the country/europe.



&gt;Or is the crisis rather the driving excuse behind racism and xenophobia in Europe?

No it's crime 
http://wodc.nl/images/ob277_volledige_tekst_tcm44-225797.pdf
In this PDF on page 34 there is a graph that shows quite well why. 
The blue line are dutch criminals, the other lines are a variety of ethnic groups. It's in dutch but the lines are clear enough.

 It's about number of criminals per 1000 people(Y axis), and the age they are (X axis)



&gt;Are its supporters exploiting the crisis to put forward an ethnic agenda that has always been there but hadn't had the right momentum in recent times?

No the crisis isn't that important in the Netherlands, we don't want to pay for the Greek and other countries mistakes but it's all far away, we have no influence on the crisis and what the Netherlands decide to do. we don't really feel anything, we are a more unemployed, that's it. 
  


&gt;Do its supporters believe only enslavement and/or killing of other ethnicities besides their own will achieve this ethnic agenda?

No, the supporters don't want to do something that barbaric, they just want them gone, out of the country, out of europe, back to their own country, as soon as foreigner commits a crime he should be on the plane back to the country he has a nationality off while taking the Dutch nationality away, If they are to young to go by themselves the whole family would have to go. As a sort of punishment for failing to give their children good upbringing.   



&gt;Or is the perception of the recent escalation of racism and xenophobia in Europe just confirmation bias?

It was taboo for a long time, now the feelings of hatred are no longer taboo and closet racists can be openly racist.

I am an average german guy, 26 years old, living in Chemnitz, Saxony.

I used to have all the prejudices: Polish people are thiefs, they are dirty, they hate us, bla bla bla.
When the Kaczynski twins started to make everything a nazi issue (which was very annoying) and your newspapers printed our politicians in SS uniforms - well, that sealed the deal for me. I didn´t like Poland, mostly because all of the hate we got.

When I started to study in Zwickau, I got to know this nice polish girl, Anna. Somehow we became best friends and I began to change my mind. I could make jokes about poles (mostly about how they steal our cars) and she could joke about us and everything was fine.
When she had to go back to Poland, I was very very sad.

I visited her two times, one time at her parent´s home near the ukrainian border, the time in Wroclaw.
I liked Poland very much! Travelling by train is a real adventure! The nature and the landscape is so rough and natural, because there is only half the population of Germany.

The costs of living were high, considering that people there earn less than here. Everyone worked hard. The people were cool, a bit hard and rough, but also friendly and kind and I enjoyed it. I partied with them at a wedding, some dudes tried to make me drunk, but I was the last one who could walk straight *win*
The girls are sooo beautiful, the dudes are soooo ugly :-)
And what surprised me most: They liked germans. Even my friends grandaunty! She lived in the area where german and soviet troops met when Poland was split at the beginning of the war. She told me that the  russians were dirty and behaved like pigs, but the germans looked so handsome in their uniforms and they were alwys friendly and gave her chocolate. She was so happy to talk to a german!

Since then, I like Poland very much. I researched a little, read the news. You people are working hard, your economy is strong and growing, Poland can be a proud member of Europe and deserves it.
Your politicans should stop playing the victims card against germany because you country doesnt need this. It´s awesome, strong and beautifull.

true,Eeko,FINL,Finland,"&gt; Was racism and xenophobia in Europe as prevalent before the crisis as it is now?

I think this is the best question to start unraveling the European immigration attitudes of this decade.

Up a few years back (I'd say it ended shortly after 9/11), Europe was really, really trying to do everything ""by the book of social justice"". Trying to set an example in tolerance and openness. Gay marriages being mostly legal, having open borders between each other (most of the issues today are due to European immigrants e.g. Romani people), strong social programs (even immigrants are allowed to very generous social benefits) and having very strict hate crime legislation. In Finland, usually the public prosecutor is the first one to claim lawsuits against religious harassment, not the people being harassed.

You could say, that USA is quite tolerant place in a way where everyone's minding their own business. European socialism and culture is more about minding about each other's business, so being tolerant and equal towards one another means sharing equally without prejudice. So if a country has social programs, you should allow foreigners to tap into. US has very little social programs, so they don't need to worry about that so much.

What happened since, was a shift in that attitude. People started to feel that immigrants were exploiting the generosity and existing social infrastructures without paying their contribution to society. Muslims forming their cliques, holding their old values (where some issues like gay- &amp; women's rights are strictly against European values) and not integrating, romani's exploiting the free roaming privileges to beg and steal instead of working, Eastern European builders working without paying taxes (and unfairly competing against domestic labour), exploiting refugee quotas, etc. Everyone knows it's only a fraction of immigrants behaving badly, but in otherwise safe and functional societies, you might suddenly see a tenfold increase in crimes virtually non-existent in the past.

So what began as a backlash against ""being the good kid"" easily let's genuine racism to gain more ground as people are vulnerable after **feeling** their trust has been exploited. Depending on society, it has gotten more ground or less. I understood Hungary is in fairly bad shape and the Greek neo-nazis have gotten ground (though more as a protest rather than genuine racism?), but most of Europe is still some of the most tolerant region on the planet. Before they felt like they owed the world their hospitality (due to stuff like WW1 &amp; 2, colonialism etc.), now they require people to bring something to the table before lending you their trust.",0,1345302203,null,0,1345302547,0,c5v25mc,t3_yf458,t1_c5v25mc,t3_yf458,null,1429671700,28,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,28

Or the grandparents might be able to fill in so that both parents go back to work, but that means no mobility - you need to stay in the city where either of you grew up. 

Of course for the people who genuinely want to be stay at home parents, the extra money will be welcome, but it seems absurd and backwards to make this incentive a priority before the daycare situation is improved and parents who want to go back to work are able to do so.

No it is not our duty. I believe in equality under law but not in forced equality through wealth redistribution. We are not equal and we will never be, and it's only fair that the most successful nations/people end up having more wealth than the rest.

&gt;Where did you get that ? Post 1920 we have mixed economies. Before that we had children cleaning chimneys.

The only reason why we don't have children cleaning chimneys and can afford the less efficient mixed economies is because capitalism allowed us to evolve to a point where society could afford to get rid of child labor and instead send them to school. Without the necessary conditions we wouldn't be able to afford our current social states and workers rights.

&gt;Before Capitalism allowed for higher productivity and capital accumulation we had children cleaning chimneys.

&gt;The rich used to pay almost 90% Tax in the ""Golden Years of Capitalism"" in the US. Check http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/displayafact.cfm?Docid=213

I doubt many payed that and to me that is near slavery. 90% of their income after a certain point, really? What's the point of working more when you're only getting 10% of it? Would you actually defend that?

&gt;It's since the 70's that neo-liberal ideas started picking up that real wages have gone down and the wealth inequality has gone up.

More like since the 70s the social state has been growing alongside bureaucracy and government intervention in the economy. Look at the weight that the spending of western governments has on the economy and I dare you to blame our problems in liberalism, an ideology which advocates small government with no/minimal intervention in the economy. The blame lies on statism and all of you who preach that the government should be a superman entity responsible for everything.

I am in full agreement with you, there.

Homeless people or other vagrants are disliked here in the USA as well.

&gt;Note: This is distinct from whether you believe in God(s) or not. For example, you might believe in God(s) and believe that it is not possible for people to ever definitively know whether God(s) exist. Or, you may believe in God(s) and believe that it is possible for people to know definitively whether God(s) exist. 

As I do not agree with the statements presented, I am an atheist and cannot agree to either of the statements ""we can know if god(s) exist"" or ""we cannot know if god(s) exist"". 

My view is that we should all know that god is a delusion but consider that the only options are implicitly stating the existence of god(s). A “or not” at the end of the statements would be clearer for myself.

true,c0mpufreak,null,null,"&gt;I am on a limited budget, food especially. Is the food inexpensive in Germany? Those of you who have been to the US, how did you find the food prices/variety compare?

I have to disagree with both extensive answers so far. Food in Germany is cheaper than in the U.S. I have lived in the U.S. for more than a year of my life by now (10 month in Wisconsin and 4 month in North Carolina) and from my experience food that you buy from grocery stores is way cheaper. Lidl and Aldi is a good advise nevertheless! Food in Resturants and Fast Food Chains is about the same as in the U.S. though :)

&gt;I need to buy a few things for my apartment while I am there, how wonderful is Ikea? Is it like the Oz I've heard it is? (We have them in the US of course but not where I'm from)

Everything said here. IKEA is awesome but can be hard to reach (since they tend to build a little far away from the city sometimes) best you talk a friend into giving you a ride there ;-)

&gt;I'm a bit nervous about the differences between the universities in the US and Europe. Any tips on how to deal with those differences

I think that German universities are a bit harder than U.S. universities. But you will be able to manage those differences. Yes it's true most of the time one final exam will determine pretty much 100% of your grade. Although there are some classes (depending on the university really) where you get parts of your grades through assignments or presentations or whatever.

&gt;Will it be easy for me to catch on to how the public transportation works? Accesible and useful public transportation and trains will be a new thing to me because of where I've grown up

Couple of tips here. First of all, yes it's easy and you'll miss it once you go back to the states. Wherever you go, ask a local how the local fare system works, and what kind of ticket you need to get to your destination. That can be quite tricky depending on the city you live in. Secondly: Go to GoogleMaps! If you click on the S in a green circle or the U in a blue square it will show you the routes of public transport and also state which lines leave from one station. For departure times for trains and public transport in cities confer to www.bahn.de they are able to give you any schedule. For long distance travel you can also buy tickets there.

&gt;Any tips on how to not be my American stereotype? I do not mind at all people knowing I'm from America, but I consider it my duty to let Germans know that we are NOT at all how we might be perceived. (most of us)

Don't worry about it :-) Tell people upfront that you're from the U.S. and they won't mind and might engage in an interesting conversation with you. You should maybe stay away from asking if Hitler is still our president but I'm sure you know better then that ;-)

&gt;I might be traveling alone some places in Europe, I'm sure it's safe, but please put my mind at ease if you can.

Relax. Europe is safe. One thing maybe - again, depending on the city you are in maybe stay away from some shady figures in the subway just to be sure :-) But in all my years in Germany I have never had a problem with anyone. Same goes for all my travels around Europe.

true,WalkerEU,CYPR,Cyprus,"You underestimate how many people are starting to hate hearing the same  depressing economic news every day.. At some point a clear majority is gonna say ""duuuudes... just.. fix this shit.. we're hearing the same crap for the last 3 years.. do _something_ to make it stop. I'm gonna start setting fire to shit if I read another headline about how bad shit is in the eurozone"".

I think what is happening right now is that we're coming to a crossroads where people are going to have to decide between a superstate or a breakup (of the eurozone). When all is said and done, I expect the majority to back the superstate just because it sounds cool, and because a lot of people will feel that it's a way to punish the politicians in their country by stripping some of their powers (I assure you southern europe will unanimously support this... France and Germany will definitely back it because this was their goal from the very beginning -- and no.. this is not a plot to 'take over europe').. everyone else (including countries like Poland) will tag along because it'd be a bit silly to stay out of a superstate backed by france and germany.

The vocal minority needs to come to the conclusion that while the majority is not extreme-pro-EU, they are not necessarily opposed to the idea of it. It just needs to be sold to them in the right way... and the concept is very good.. Confederation was a fuckup in the U.S. that lead to a war.. they ended up becoming a federation and enjoyed quite a lot of years of major economic growth and went on to become the strongest country on the planet after that. The EU (with the UK on board) would dwarf the US economically... what are our priorities guys? Do we want prosperity and advancement in one direction or are we gonna keep playing the ""our dicks are bigger than your dicks // our boobs look better than your boobs"" game that has worked wonders for the last few thousand years?

The uncertainty of the fallout that would arise from a breakup of the eurozone is scary... good luck exporting shit to a country like Italy if they decide ""ok then mofos... we're lazy, eh? Well screw you.. I'm not gonna buy products from your country. Italy #1!"" (it doesn't have to be a law or anything.. just public opinion)... is this what we want to promote?

Good luck getting countries to co-operate on important matters such as green energy, space exploration etc etc if they are not tied between them.. You can already see a lot of the non-EU countries are giving the EU the middle finger on various projects regarding protecting the environment because ""we don't have to put up with this shit"".. be careful what you wish for..

Sweden, as an example is a great country... A few years ago, Sweden screwed up big time and was going through a southern-europe-like phase.. you got past it.. It would also be wise to remember that when it comes to important global *decisions*, Sweden will never be heard or respected.. You have a very small economy compared to other countries (Italy is more important than Sweden in the global scene, as an example). Make no mistake, your politicians will help sell you the concept of joining a federal union if France and Germany are part of it.. They were right in being cautious with the current configuration of the EU and eurozone, but should a proper configuration be created, it may actually be a huge mistake not to be part of it. Our primary concern is the future and prosperity, right?

I would assume an efficient and intelligent government would have certain goals for the future that all governments must follow for various reasons based on lessons from the past.. so when you see something unpopular like.... hmmm.. Sweden contributing to bailout funds.. it's because the government did their homework and realized that Norrsken is going to be more angry if certain outcomes come from not contributing rather than the anger Norrsken will have by contributing.

In the case of the UK splitting off from the EU as it becomes a superstate, they will be doomed to doing whatever the two superpowers surrounding it (federal eu + us) tell it to do and they will not have much room to make their own demands heard (This is why I believe the UK would benefit more by assuming some sort of leader position inside a federal europe.. this way they can at least try to have their agendas heard rather than totally discarded for shits and giggles).",0,1345304674,null,0,false,0,c5v2n5d,t3_yfcsp,t1_c5v2n5d,t1_c5v26wy,null,1429671938,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

First of all I'm a classical liberal not a neo-liberalist. 2nd it is a lie that the rich pay nothing now. They give a higher percentage of their income than anyone else provided they aren't escaping taxes and most of the income tax revenues come from rich people. What about it huh?

As for taxing wealth at 90% well good to know you support 21st century slavery.

&gt;Neo-liberalism is the source of all this

No, the source of all this where countries relying on debt to pay for their excessive spending.

&gt;If it keeps going societies will become more and more unequal. What you will get in 10 years from now is inequality the likes of which humanity would have never seen before, a by-product of completely unregulated markets.

What is wrong with inequality in itself? I don't care about inequality and never will. What I do care is seeing how well the poorest live, if they live better off in a highly unequal society then so what? Just like Thatcher said, you guys are more bothered by the gap than where the bottom is.

&gt;If you are fine with walking outside your flat and seeing the dead and hungry piling up, by all means keep supporting what you are supporting.

This is so funny because a liberal capitalist society is the best defense against people falling into poverty.

We Americans complain all the time about problems with racism... but intriguingly, the fact that it's been an open topic of conversation for decades means that we have worked through the problem... and established a solution of a profound national belief in multiculturalism which European countries ought to look at and learn from.

You are right that *unlimited* and permanent fiscal transfers from ""north to south"" would be a disaster.. But at the same time, the whole ""north"" and ""south"" thing is fictional. Italy is ""south"", yet Italy is still an extremely big and important economy (Bigger than all of the scandinavian countries put together)..

The type of management that lead to this alleged ""southern europe"" problem definitely needs to be solved.

The transfer system should never be the permanent solution, but a tool to give countries a chance to fix their problems without being sniped from all angles by vultures.

This is why it's important for a central government to be able to control each country's finances. This is the only way that the ""north"" can guarantee that their transfers to the ""south"" will be used to help put the countries on a sustainable path where they won't need transfers anymore or so that they can transfer money to other countries in need in the future. This is the path towards a superstate. We will not have the transfers without the superstate simply because your opinion is correct in that you don't want to permanently subsidize other countries with unlimited funds, but as decent human beings you won't mind subsidizing ""your neighbours"" temporarily if you know that this will help them fix their problems.

true,sqrt2,EURO,European Union,"I think Austria is an interesting example because it has had a successful political party expressing these sentiments since 1985, when Jörg Haider became the leader of the FPÖ, the Freedom Party of Austria. They have had varied success in elections, currently polling around 25%, at about the same level as the conservative party and about five points below the social democrats.

The party itself finds itself on a scale between populism that gets them votes and far-right ideology, recruiting many of their personnel from fraternities (of which there is the ultra-catholic type, which gravitate towards the conservative party, and the nationalist and Nazi types, connected to the Freedom party). Generally, and especially under the current leader Strache, the populist wing dominates. Politicians portrayed as ideological figures don't have a lot of traction with the voters, for example in the last presidential election their candidate Barabara Rosenkranz received a meager 15% of votes in an election where the conservative party did not put up a candidate.

The Freedom Party's political track record is distastrous with a number of big corruption scandals on the federal level (where they were part of the governing coalition in the first half of the last decade) and in Carinthia (where the party has dominated since Haider's takeover of the party) having come to light in the recent years. Their policies in important areas don't stand up to scrutiny at all and even openly contradict their campaign slogans. For example, they propose to reduce the public expenditure quota by 4 points, which effectively means cutting the federal budget by about 20% (a conclusion that they never voice themselves). They back this up with vague, unscientific references to the Laffer curve and structural reform. All the while, they campaign for a welfare state (with entitlements granted only to Austrians).

Therefore, I can only conclude that the party's appeal is that it presents simple solutions to complex problems. Budgetary problems? Campaign against giving grants to artists critical of Austrian society. Privatise profitable public enterprises to balance the budget for one year. Social change, stagnating wages? Blame the immigrants.

My assumption is that in principle any movement that could present a clear message in a time where leaders have no idea how to solve the big problems and century-old political movements like the social democrats completely lost their profile could pick up 25% of the votes, and the ones growing in Europe are in line with a general sentiment on a continent where people used to go to war with each other at least once in a generation.",0,1345307199,null,0,1345307763,0,c5v37n9,t3_yf458,t1_c5v37n9,t3_yf458,null,1429672198,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

My problem with your previous post was that you seemed insufficiently pissed off about the racial violence committed. Everything I have read tells me that Romani culture is *ahem...* difficult to integrate, and you make a lot of good points.

My point is that, in the American South we (meaning relatively wealthy and/or white people) figured out that, as outrageous as gang violence and the crimes of the impoverished can be, WE MUST GUARD AGAINST OUR OWN HATRED FIRST. Roma culture may involve a lot of awful shit, but as the dominant culture YOU need to stand down your own hatred if there will be a peaceful resolution.

And don't tell me that crimes against Roma are treated equally. Again, Americans have a lot of experience with the different ways crimes are treated when they are committed *by* vs. *against* minorities. We strive towards equal justice under law, but it doesn't happen here, it doesn't happen in The Hague and it sure as hell doesn't happen in Romania. 

Still, the US and western Europe have made progress via the expedient of incorporating minorities disproportionately into our police force. If you guys can employ Roma anywhere, you need to employ them there. They know their own people, they know their habits, and most importantly they can tell the difference between the hardened criminals vs. kids with a bad break, even among a group you or I would see as ""just a bunch of Gypsies.""

This isn't a ""maybe"" - people will go for the cheaper strawberries that will also be of the same/similar quality - this means instead of employing immigrant workers picking strawberries and keeping production in The Netherlands, you would simply remove that industry from the country entirely, which would be economically worse.

This would definitely happen if wages went up - but it's not certain wages would go up... if there is high unemployment and lots of strawberry picking jobs available at a low wage, they might actually get filled without immigrant workers.

The main problem behind it all is this part:

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; Lets just say, the concept of a transfer system is very good when you find yourself being the one needing help. The concerns you pointed out are also important in that the transfer system should never be the permanent solution (ie. certain countries always receiving money forever), but instead just a **buffer to help you get out of trouble** while keeping the market confidence because ""clearly, this country will not be allowed to go under as they are being supported by the rest of them""

I get the sense from your comment that you don't really see that there are great underlying problems in economies and societies of troubled countries like Greece, Portugal, Spain, Italy and Ireland. If that really would be the case, then having a buffer fund would be a really good thing, but in case where there are really big problems, then there is no buffer big enough to fix the situation because fixing the problems are all about political will to do reforms.

For example...

* ...there is increased global competition in industry sectors that were before mainly serviced by Spanish and Italian firms, that are now in intense pressure from Chinese companies.
* ...oil and gas cost more and more and in the future they will cost even more, this will greatly affect countries like Italy and Greece who don't have neither own fossil fuel production or non-fossil fuel based energy generation, hydro dams and nuclear plants.
* ...fertility rates in all of troubled countries are too low, varying from 1.33 to 1.46, meaning that there will be less workers in the future to take care of the elderly in such a quantity that the current pension system will explode if reforms aren't done to decrease current and future pensions while increasing current and future pension contributions.
* ...there is too much corruption and not enough business friendliness

And that was just a few things. The thing is that markets will always get these things, and if somebody disagrees with them, they will speculate until that somebody looses. In this case the people who disagree with the reality are politicians and those who have voted them in, they have a distorted view of reality.

true,Sle,BERL,Berlin,"Steer clear of Vodafone. I am on with them now and have pretty damn good DSL Festnetz, but it was a long and brutal struggle to finally connect that I fear is not confined to Vodafone, though I will say that they are pretty special when it comes  to shit customer service:

Firstly, straight off the bat, I had to wait over a month for a technician ""Termin"" (Never needed this in Britain). It was originally arranged for a Wednesday, but the letter I received said Saturday. All well and good, but delicate negotiations had to be made at work for that Wednesday off and to see after all that that they were coming on a Saturday was puzzling and annoying.

The technician came, plugged some things in and said ""Everything is done, tschüs"". I wondered what the fuck I was to do to connect and called the ""hotline"". They said ""So plug the router in, silly!"". I had no fucking router. After another 15 minute wait for the ""hotline"", I was informed that I DID have the router, and it was signed for by a ""Familie Werner"". All subsequent calls were basically affirmations that I did have the router delivered and ""Familie Werner"" were to give it to me. No negotiation or reason was listened to, I was clearly insane and had my router, that was that. The problem was that there was no fucking Werner in my building.

It took a MONTH (which I paid for) for them to finally accept that this ""Werner"" did not exist and they had to send another router. The delivery company were ""having some problems"". Some calls to their ""hotline"" were agonising. My German is pretty OK, but of course if you're talking to a girl that didn't listen at school and has no patience for anything but fluency in German, it's not going to go well, especially when they talk ten-to-the-dozen and insist that I am lying and have my router all along - ""Ich kann dir nicht helfen"".

Then the router came, but because of all the palaver, my ""Instalations code"" (What in the actual fuck.. no other country in the world requires this and the router needed it to begin functioning) was incorrect and I had to wait through 3 calls and a further week for the new code to be generated. (Agony.. They didn't believe that my code didn't work.)

Now, after 6 weeks from the engineer's visit, I finally have internet. As a bizarre footnote, earlier in the week I received a request to testify against the delivery company that ""Werner"" does not exist, otherwise I will be charged for 2 routers. They still do not believe me.

* Don't expect any of your courses to have syllabi.  When they do, be pleasantly surprised and grateful.
* Don't expect French professors to hold your hand, and definitely don't expect the sort of relationship you would have with an American professor (i.e., [the client-provider relationship](http://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2012/05/28/pourquoi-harvard-ne-fait-pas-rever_1707618_3232.html), advising, deep rapport is not a guarantee).

The French university system generally requires much more independence than American colleges do, and rewards autodidacts and self-starters handsomely.  It has evolved out of significantly different historical precedents relative to the English/American/German systems and this difference is still evident today. Also, as some others have mentioned, it does not exhibit the grade inflation present in American colleges today.  In terms of organization it is incredibly decentralized, and does not have the same sort of campus life you might expect from college. 

That said, I should provide the disclaimer that I only studied in France for a semester before returning to my American college, and I may have some mistaken impressions.

true,Fdurke,Languedoc,Languedoc-Roussillon,"&gt;-French academic writing in the humanities - are there any guidelines that students are taught to follow from lycée onwards? Are there any noticeable differences in how students analyze a text in, for example, American universities?

&gt;-Lectures and exams - is there anything that might surprise a foreign student regarding how these are organized?

I don't know for comparative littérature but, as far as law goes its quite ""unique"" the way we do it in France. I believe it will be the same for other humanities. French system weight a lot on redactionnal skills and rhetorical skills in what we call ""dissertation"". Its like an Essay but with a lot of constraint regarding its composition with a plan etc... There is also texte commentaries. And I know that they have merely not a thing in common with what we had in the Lycée.

For exams, usually you have in the University to at least get 10 pts on 20 to succeed your years (which means validating most of the courses), these courses are separated between majors and minors per semesters.

You are required to know what the teachings encompass and to be able to personnaly build a reasonnable and interressant study around it (for dissertation).

The universities are mostly ""in"" the city (I don't know for Caen though, but my cousin was there and I believe she said that her faculty was near her home and she lived in the center). So don't expect a special ""college"" life like in the US or UK. There is a student life but it is include in the city as whole. 

I belive you will manage to found beautifull appartements in Caen (in the center). Learn to love the train if you want to travel. Drink, don't be afraid (if you are up to that). And contrary to a persistant belief abroad we are mostly very clean people :).

Opinion surveys are not that great as far as evidence goes but they sure as hell beat your personal anecdotes. 

&gt;Can these be integrated and still be religious, yes of course. 

Not really. Europe, the most secular continent on Earth by far, is becoming not only increasingly more so, people are abandoning religion altogether. Integration, by definition, requires the abandonment of those beliefs that are most incompatible with the host culture. 

The survey above says that young Turks in Germany are becoming more religious, not less, with is the exact opposite of young Germans—and young Europeans in general. When the demographic (youth) that will one day make up the backbone of the country is actually pulling away from itself you can't say that society's becoming more integrated. 

A recent example was the circumcision controversy in Germany—Muslims practice genital mutilation and even ""secular"" Turks embrace the practice while Germans are in favor of banning it. The German constitution itself guarantees the right to bodily integrity; what happens when the issue reaches the Bundesverfassungsgericht? This issue's not simply going to go away.

De facto vs. de jure secularity. The United States is also supposedly more secular than most of Europe according to its laws but in practice, and particularly when it comes to the beliefs of its people, not so much. 

&gt;Also regarding circumcision, it was ruled to be legal under freedom of religion outlined in the German constitution and has never been banned. What you disagree with is the interpretation of that law and want a new law introduced to ban it.

The German constitution does not specifically mention circumcision, only freedom of religion and the right to bodily integrity. The practice was never taken into account when the constitution was drafted in the first place, such as how the American Bill of Rights guaranteed many rights for free men but does not mention slavery. 

When this issue finally makes its way to the constitutional court, it *will* doubtlessly rule that circumcision is a violation of the child's rights and that's when shit will hit the fan and we'll really see just how integrated German Turks are. There's no need for any laws to be brought into place to ban the practice, just a reinterpretation of the constitution according to modern arguments. 

&gt;What you want is a change in the current German legal system, not the Muslims/Jews who presumably want it to remain as it is.

That is completely irrelevant to my point to begin with since what I was pointing out is that a majority of Germans want it banned which shows yet another glaring cultural gap between Germans and Turks.

Some people. 

&gt;Integration, by definition, requires the abandonment of those beliefs that are most incompatible with the host culture.

Islam is quite compatible with the host culture and has been for hundreds of years.

&gt; The survey above says that young Turks in Germany are becoming more religious, not less, with is the exact opposite of young Germans—and young Europeans in general. When the demographic (youth) that will one day make up the backbone of the country is actually pulling away from itself you can't say that society's becoming more integrated.

You can be European and religious, German and religious - these things aren't mutually exclusive. 

&gt;The survey above says that young Turks in Germany are becoming more religious, not less, with is the exact opposite of young Germans—and young Europeans in general. 

*Indeed, even as the number of those who identify themselves as strictly religious is rising (from 33 percent in 2009 to 37 percent this year)*

That enormous leap of a whole 4%.

I think you may be exaggerating just a little.

&gt; A recent example was the circumcision controversy in Germany—Muslims practice genital mutilation and even ""secular"" Turks embrace the practice while Germans are in favor of banning it. The German constitution itself guarantees the right to bodily integrity; what happens when the issue reaches the Bundesverfassungsgericht? This issue's not simply going to go away.

C'était un exemple, pour montrer le ridicule de ton raisonnement selon moi. La ""valeur travail"" est actuellement plus un attrape-couillon qu'autre chose, parfois.

Assumer de faire de gros efforts lorsqu'il y a une raison derrière : okay.
Faire de gros efforts alors qu'on se fait entuber par un patron : la seule génération qui en a profité réellement était celle ayant connu les Trente Glorieuses... qui n'avaient rien à voir avec la capacité à travailler des citoyens Français, mais plutôt avec un ensemble de bonnes conditions macroéconomiques. C'était l'une des rares périodes où le partage de la valeur ajoutée s'est fait énormément en faveur du salariat... et pas parce que les gens bossaient bien, mais parce qu'ils ont beaucoup gueulé.

Je suis une sorte d'économiste, sans trop m'étendre là-dessus. Ce qui m'énerve le plus sont ceux qui cherchent à ""moraliser"" l'économie. Comme s'il suffisait de dire aux gens ""bosser plus"" ou ""innovez"" pour que cela puisse marcher. Les gens réagissent aux incitations. S'ils ne sont pas incités à bien travailler, innover ou croire en leur job, il est normal que des choses s'écroulent.

Si ce manager préfère privilégier un gros turn-over, un faible attachement à son établissement, aucune loyauté de ses salariés, il ne doit pas s'étonner s'il lui arrive un jour ou l'autre des conneries. Même s'il respecte à fond la loi. Être un vrai connard peut se faire légalement.


""La valeur travail"" n'est qu'une connerie. Elle a moins à voir avec le succès que l'origine sociale des gens ou leur signalement sur le marché de l'emploi. Sérieusement, encore une fois, s'il est important de savoir faire des efforts, en faire pour du beurre, s'épuiser dans des boulots sans intérêts, est sûrement pire.

""-je connais plein de gonzes qui ont su rester integres meme avec un salaire de misere, et c'est cette integrite qui fait qu'on ne bouffe plus de vache enragee.""

Je connais des gens qui, en méprisant totalement leur travail, leur patron et leur environnement de boulot, vivent très bien, ne bouffent pas de vaches enragées, et vivent même de mieux en mieux. Le détachement de la ""valeur travail"" et un regard très opportuniste leur a beaucoup apporté.

Tu vois, on peut trouver des contre-exemples à partir de : ""oh, tu sais, j'ai connu des gens qui..."".

""Donc si tu preferes fanfaronner dans de telles situations, ne t'etonne donc pas des consequences que tu devras assumer.""

Il devrait assumer quoi ? Quitter un job de merde en ayant fait enrager un petit patron minable ? Non, sérieusement...

Pour cela, je lui conseille de rester dans les limites de la légalité et de ce qu'il peut assumer sur ce plan. 

Sinon, s'il commence à se faire respecter comme un individu, et cela pourra toujours lui servir plus tard. 

""...et en y repensant, si je recrutais quelqu'un, j'aimerais bien savoir comment il aborde ses jobs les moins gratifiants, fût-ce à court terme.""

Et il pourra te baratiner comme c'est toujours le cas lors d'un recrutement de ce type.
Et tu seras peut-être un mauvais recruter si le type en face de toi est un commercial de haut niveau, un ingénieur, un consultant, un chargé d'études, etc. à qui tu demandes de la ""niaque"", de savoir se faire respecter, etc. alors que dans ta tête, tu aimerais bien qu'il soit soumis comme un clébard à sa hiérarchie (ce qui n'est pas toujours compatible avec une approche volontariste, innovante, pleine d'initiative...).
Ou alors ça n'aurait rien à voir avec ce qu'il devrait faire dans ta boîte. 
Enfin : il n'est pas obligé de le marquer sur son CV. C'est même déconseillé, au bout d'un moment. Etant jeune, je refais mon CV actuellement et était plutôt fier d'afficher une pelleté de boulots alimentaires (usine, agent administratif, distributeur de tracts, surveillant de distributeurs de tracts, etc). On m'a clairement dit que c'était complètement idiot. Si on doit me recruter comme consultant, chargé d'études, ou autre, on en a rien à foutre que je sache faire des boulots de ce type.

Mais surtout : imaginons que tu juges mal le fait que sa période d'essai ne se soit pas terminée. Parce qu'apparemment, c'est le cas pour tout le monde dans sa boîte, qui préfère jouer avec ses périodes d'essai que de recruter des CDD (plus coûteux que des gens en CDI qu'on ne recrute finalement pas). Alors tu feras peut-être l'impasse sur un excellent élément qui est juste tombé sur un patron frôlant la légalité.

Vois-tu, c'est justement lorsque je lis des commentaires comme le tien que je me dis : voilà pourquoi le pays se casse la gueule. Des gens qui croient qu'au lieu d'offrir des incitations aux salariés (salaire, bonnes conditions de travail, respect, etc.) pensent qu'il faut leur offrir des valeurs morales, leur rappeler l'existence de la valeur travail, et leur inculquer les bonnes manières.

Voilà pourquoi ton recrutement sera alors (potentiellement) un échec, si tu te focalises sur ce genre de choses. Demander de la ""passion"", la ""valeur travail"", etc. à tes candidats ne s'appuient sur rien de tangibles, ne peuvent se mesurer, ne peuvent se vérifier, et fait juste partie d'une sorte de carcan moral destiné à faire croire qu'il y aurait des ""méritants"" dans notre économie. Approche quasi-religieuse, totalement moraliste. Alors que tu devras plutôt demander des faits, des exemples, des réalisations.

Je me souviens d'un recrutement pour lequel (heureusement !) je n'ai pas été pris. J'étais surqualifié par rapport à l'offre d'emploi, mais très motivé et surtout je commençais à sentir la catastrophe sociale de mon côté (ah, oui, trop jeune pour toucher le RSA, et passer de stage en stage n'aide pas pour l'alloc chômage !). J'étais VRAIMENT surqualifié. Il s'agissait d'une sorte de poste d'analyste de retours d'enquêtes. Très simple. A chaque fois que j'avais fait ce genre de boulot, j'avais même créé un petit programme pour tout automatiser, boostant un peu la productivité de mon service. Là, je proposais ce genre de choses, d'abaisser ma demande en termes de salaire, de coller totalement au poste exprès. 
Après le second entretien, deux informations : 

- le recrutement se faisait en urgence parce que la précédente personne NE FAISAIT PAS L'AFFAIRE au bout de quelques semaines/mois d'essai (boulot de cadre, tout de même, donc grosse période d'essai),

- je ne faisais pas l'affaire car je ne ressentais pas la PASSION de l'analyse de retours d'enquête. Cela ne se sentait pas EN MOI. J'avais toutes les compétences, j'étais même surqualifié, mais je n'avais pas la PASSION. Je déconne pas, c'était ridicule à ce point. 

J'étais mort de rire. La nana qui me sortait ça était une vieille peau qui estimait réellement qu'elle pouvait payer à peine au-dessus du SMIC des gens ayant bac +5, analystes économiques et statistiques, ayant des fonctions de cadres actifs (responsabilités au bout d'un moment), et compenser toutes les charges, le bas salaire, etc. par la recherche d'un ""passionné"". J'osais pas lui demander si c'était le principal critère pour sélectionner le candidat précédent.

En agissant ainsi, soit ils ne peuvent prendre que des losers, soit ils ne peuvent prendre que des gens ""passionnés"" mais complètement soumis. L'innovation ne pourra d'ailleurs jamais venir, sauf cas exceptionnel, de salariés pris mais uniquement en descente verticale, des supérieurs hiérarchiques qui ne sont pas sur le terrain, ne peuvent donc pas déceler des sources d'innovation et d'accroissements de la productivité, d'amélioration des produits, le plus souvent.

Des anecdotes comme ça, j'en ai peut-être une dizaine, douzaine, alors que je suis relativement jeune. Et je parle uniquement de celles me concernant, hein. Cette croyance stupide qu'un salarié doit être entre le chien, le mobilier de bureau, le couteau suisse, et le mouton à cinq pattes : sous-payé, il doit avoir X années d'expériences, être passionné, motivé, se sentir 'investi' et en même temps avoir des compétences extraordinaires. Une majorité des patrons et managers intermédiaires ne veulent pas non plus former (trop de temps, donc trop d'argent, et trop de risques pris !) ou s'investir eux-mêmes dans leurs ressources humaines. 

Tu sais comment les pays les plus développés du monde font pour tenir la cadence ? Ils investissent dans le ""capital humain"" et ils cherchent à éviter les crises de légitimité de leurs élites politiques et économiques. Tout ce que la France ne fait plus depuis longtemps. La réaction en disant ""les jeunes n'ont plus la valeur travail !"" est justement ce qui provoque la chute du pays : on inculque pas cette valeur ; elle vient d'elle-même lorsque les gens savent pourquoi ils doivent travailler. Et lorsqu'ils travaillent aveuglément, comme de petits clébards obéissants, sans jamais rien remettre en cause, on se retrouve uniquement avec un pays du tiers-monde qui est incapable d'innover.",0,1345367995,null,0,false,0,c5vfgb0,t3_ybgs6,t1_c5vfgb0,t1_c5ves5x,null,1429678093,2,false,france,t5_2qhjz,2

&gt;The law can easily be changed so as to not as discriminate against religious minorities which is what banning the practice actually is. 

No, it cannot be changed because this is not a law but the German constitutions which specifically establishes the right to bodily integrity and religious freedom and infant/childhood circumcision interferes with both.

Homeland could refer to historical heritage as well, and in that respect it isn't surprising that German Turks look to the land of their ancestors when thinking of the homeland.
* Having more mosques doesn't make them un-german (a secular nation with freedom of religion). It says more about your fear of islam (which in some interpretation is bad of course, but not in all and every case) than the desire of the young turks to practice their religion.
* The point of the article is that religion replaces the ethno-cultural bond with turkey, that is slowly getting weaker. I believe it's a counter reaction to the fact, that the young turks are in a limbo between western and middle eastern cultures and therefore look for something that is anything but = religion.

&gt;No, the real story here is that more young Turks are more likely to claim that Islam is the ""one true religion"". That's a recipe for peaceful cohabitation right there.

Funny that because the history of muslims in modern europe is one of peaceful cohabitation on the whole. Apart from the small number of radicals most muslims integrate perfectly well into society. Still it great that you can find something to hate them for. It seems its a survey for everyone. Bigots like you and the rest of us.

The right to bodily integrity is obvious but even the right to religious freedom can be used to attack the practice based on whether the relevant rights are those of the parents or of the child. 

And of course, there's female circumcision to consider. Any argument used to defend its male counterpart in the aforementioned context would also apply here.

Non. l'auteur a signé un contrat qui l'autorise à partir maintenant, illico, donc, ou dans 2 semaines en s'acquittant modestement de sa tâche.""

Et alors ? Tu me parles des éléments qu'il a contractualisé sur la durée de son contrat et de sa période d'essai. Je te parle des relations de travail en général et des rapports hiérarchiques. Ce n'est pas parce que ces derniers sont formellement définis qu'il faut intérioriser toutes les formes de domination possibles.

L'auteur a également signé un contrat qui ne doit pas être utilisé afin de fournir une main-d’œuvre corvéable et précaire, et dont l'utilisation ne doit être détournée. Ce que nous expose l'auteur, c'est aussi que le patron ne respecte pas le Code du Travail à ce niveau, mais il ne peut prouver aisément cela.

Si on le croit totalement (je veux bien, à ce niveau...), l'auteur peut coller un procès (long, fastidieux, demandant pas mal d'efforts pour rassembler des preuves, etc) à son employeur. Le problème est que la justice en France, y compris au niveau des relations interprofessionnelles, pose de gros soucis de lenteurs et justement, de mauvaises considérations par de futurs employeurs (là, on devient plus aisément fichable...). Un peu comme d'être adhérent à un syndicat, pourtant parfaitement légal, mais qui peut nous faire oublier pas mal de boulots. Ce qui est parfaitement illégal (un recruteur n'a pas à discriminer un candidat sur ce genre de critères), mais pourtant pratiqué. 

La loi et la justice sont du côté des puissants, pour ce genre de ""petits abus"". Donc ouais, désolé de te le dire, mais je continue de penser que l'auteur n'a pas seulement le droit moral (je ne parle pas en termes juridique) de bien faire sentir à son employeur son mécontentement, mais qu'il en a, dans un sens, le devoir.

Je ne te mets pas dans une case, hein. Je reprends juste ton raisonnement, tu soulignais que c'était avec ce genre de raisonnements que la France a des problèmes. Bien. Je te réponds que je pense le contraire. Pour moi, l'auteur a parfaitement raison de penser du mal de son employeur et de lui vouloir ""du mal"". J'ajoute à cela qu'il doit tout faire pour que cela ne puisse pas lui retomber dessus à un moment ou à un autre (rien d'illégal ou pouvant être prouvé, qu'il se renseigne d'un point de vue juridique, etc.).

J'avais été recruté en étant dans la merde financièrement, et devait ""tout"" accepter.

Je lui ai hurlé dessus, un jour, parce qu'il dépassait les bornes. Tout s'est bien passé par la suite.

Non seulement j'avais été pas mal augmenté, mais il me laissait bien plus de responsabilités après coup. C'était juste un minable pas très sûr de lui qui en profitait pour écraser tous ceux qui voulaient (et j'insiste : qui VOULAIENT) bien se laisser maltraiter.

But there's a point where you should pull the brakes and say no more. 

I don't know where this incredible fear of being considered racist is coming from. I reckon WW2 still left its marks, but come on. There's a BIG difference between ""let's ask people to know the language (because sometimes they never bother), maybe work for a little bit before getting any from the tax payer's hard earned money"" and ""let's kill all people who aren't from here'.

Anyone with half a brain knows that we're heading to a bad, bad place, but for political purposes, some parties will defend immigration until the end, even when it's painfully clear that something needs to change. But once you point at the facts and say ""buddy, there's no denying"" (and the facts are there, you've seen them in real life), you're shunned for not fitting into their politically correct world. 

It's a vicious cycle: once you start handing out passports like it's no big deal, there is (legally) extremely little you can to do to take it back. You're giving them a vote. And obviously they vote for the people that keep the money flowing in their direction. So those parties prosper, and make it impossible to tighten the flow of immigration and money. So they keep the people and money flowing in. Vicious circle. And there is no way to break it. 

It's so incredibly frustrating.

I lived in Austria for four years, and in France for even longer, and despite the successful integration of *most* Muslims, the locals still seem to hold a grudge. 

Let's look at the facts: Muslims account for **less than 4% of Germany's population**, and the majority hail from the Turkish community, a community that his flourished without major incident for more than 50 years. 

This is an honest question: What the hell gives? Did I miss the news of terrorist attacks, honor killings or widespread extremism in Germany? 

Most Canadian cities are majority non-white, non-Christian. And yet, we don't have parades dedicated to harassing immigrants and their cultures. You don't see signs calling for a ""Purer Canada"" or some such nonsense. 

So why is it that Canadians can peacefully co-exist with their foreign compatriots, whereas the Germans have more difficulty? Is this more about ethnicity than religion? Only 45% of Germans believe in God, according to Der Spiegel, so it's not as though Islam is competing to become country's dominant existential narrative.

What is it we are supposed to join then? Please answer that, at least.

You sound like those US conservatives who see their constitution as something that should only be taken literally and that should never change. Context changes, constitutions get amended and treaties renegotiated. Currently in the EU it's done in a rush because what's at stake should've been discussed for years already. Still, do note that the Maastricht criteria are made tougher with the fiscal treaty in exchange of more solidarity and Germany is adamant that this time the controls will be more effective with most of them being automatic and the potential involvement of the ECJ. If you want even stronger controls, you will actually need even more federalism with a strong central administration able to force member states to comply even if they resist (for instance through direct budgetary control like it's starting to happen in Greece). Countries signing the fiscal treaty do so in full knowledge be they amongst the richest or the poorest. They must therefore see this compromise as still providing advantages for them, for instance the promise that they will be able to benefit from the same solidarity given to Greece, Ireland or Portugal.

Frankly, since what is negotiated now has been postponed for so many years because there always was a country to block everything because it wasn't perfect, I don't care personally what one country thinks.

I could argue that you also never answer, since you always stick to the same 2-3 points that more or less say ""WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO PAY FOR OTHERS?!!!!"" and ""BUT I NEVER DID ANYTHING WRONG, EVERYONE ELSE SCREWED UP WHY IS IT MY FAULT?"". They are perfectly valid points, but look around you.. we live in a global world today. If these countries fall, you will follow very soon.

We already covered the sheer size of the Italian economy yesterday, and the Spanish one is actually quite big as well. If those two economies ever came to a full standstill, the entire eurozone will too (Sweden's largest trading partner). They basically have you by the balls.. if you don't help out, you're next. So all of these countries (including yours) will not allow such a thing to happen, that's why we're all going to continue paying -- the alternative would be worse.

By the way.. nobody has denied there are big imbalances in the various economies, but why are you treating this as if it's some permanent thing that will never change? What do you think the european leaders discuss between them every time they meet? They discuss ways of resolving this thing. This takes time to do... and the whole point of a fiscal union is so that the reforms are guaranteed by a central authority.

The Spanish, Italians etc will eventually get through their problems and may even outperform Sweden. Moral? Don't throw the towel in and decide you're above all of this yet.. keep working and pay your taxes. Yes.. these countries screwed up as a collective -- but no, it is not an inferior culture and you do not belong to a superior culture. So before you start patting yourself on the back, remind yourself that IKEA (formerly Swedish) is no longer swedish on paper so that they can tax evade.. Perhaps greed is not a cultural problem? Are you really immune to this?

I am glad many people do not forget why the EU idea was initially created.. to avoid wars and increase co-operation. This involves helping each other out when we have problems. If we cannot help someone who is going through a hard time right now, then the whole concept has failed.

If you continue to have concerns about a small percentage of the [ (few thousand SEK you paid in VAT and income tax) - (any government subsidies you have ever used including university and health care) ] being used to bailout other countries, please raise it with your elected representatives so that they can explain to you how Sweden may be vulnerable if the eurozone collapses and why they cannot say ""Fuck you"" to the EU.

If Italy hasn't been able to fix southern Italy, how how are they going to fix it in the next 5-10 years (so, that the transfers do not become permanent). **How, is Greece going to start paying taxes?** You have nothing concrete, apart from wanting money for countries who are underperfoming and refusing to deal with the underlying problems. If everything goes perfect with Greece, they will still have a debt/GDP ratio of 120 % in 10 years (and that has already crashed and burned). If they are not receiving transfers, **how are they going to live in the manners which they are accustomed to**? I'd like to see your plan. **Which year, will you see them pay taxes with the loyalty of the Finns?** Give me numbers, dates etc! The transfers have been going on btw since the 80', so I'd argue that they are already permanent, but since you are saying they will not be, I guess they will stop around 2022. How? There must be calculations for this, and I am dying to see it.

&gt; Shouldn't Greece pay taxes, countries vote for tough, but necessary reforms, not raise their salaries above what is reasonable etc?

Where did you see anyone even try to argue against that?

&gt; Good, just show me the democratic process in which the Maastrich treaty is being renegotiated. I have no problem with that, change is necessary. Where is the new draft?

Don't play innocent and then scream that people don't answer your questions. This has been answered several time, even directly to you in other threads. Treaties are being signed by democratically elected head of states and then ratified by democratically elected parliaments and even some time depending on each member state put to a refenredum. You might not find it democratic enough but this is entirely in the hands of each member states so stop talking for them. Besides even Sweden would have a shitload of treaties besides the EU-related ones to denounce if this process wasn't good enough.

&gt; The problem is that there is nothing to vote about- is it. It is being played by the ear, and very, very poorly as well.

The fuck are [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Stability_Mechanism#Ratification) and [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Fiscal_Compact#Ratification) then? Now, setting up the EFSF was indeed much more shifty but we're way beyond that now and we're back on a much more open and democratic track. If it wasn't so dramatic it would be funny how the financial markets are clamoring that the ratification process is too slow while people like you are upset because it is not discussed enough.

&gt; Yes, but the countries, who were required to sign them when they joined didn't know that most countries don't follow laws, rules and regulations - in fact, most countries didn't give a shit about it.

Did you actually read the sentence you're quoting? I'm specifically talking about the recent fiscal treaty so signatories are fully aware of who's a bad neighbour. The new controls are tougher and now everybody has a very real idea of what may happen if they are bypassed.

&gt; Oh, and about the poorest. Do you think it is right that the poor countries like Estonia, Slovenia (and also, but to a lesser extent Bulgaria, Rumania) is supporting the richer ones so that they don't fall to their level? Where did they sign up for that?

They did by signing treaties that were negotiated between member states *including them* on these specific mechanisms. Big fucking deal.

&gt; Solidarity is a two way street, isn't it?

Yes it is. Most of the countries you cited are still net recipients of European Structural Funds, even after the EFSF/ESM is taken into account and whatever way you look at it (absolute value, difference, per capita). Do not try to paint it as though old rich evil southern member states are abusing the poor virtuous eastern ones.

Poland joins euro and starts to get massive influxes of investment which causes relative prices to boom.

Then the next bit, all that cash that flew into Poland suddenly has to be paid back but the Polish economy can't muster it, it was all a false boom. A way for Germany to create demand.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Hey, so I just moved to Cologne about two weeks ago (close to Bonn) and here are some tips.

Everything is in cash. EVERYTHING. Even at Ikea, if you buy 500€ of stuff, they will only take cash. I miss throwing the guy at Starbucks my debit card - but no longer. Get used to having a ton of change. Be proactive about using change for small stuff, like a beer, or else youll end up with a massive jar of change.

Food is cheap. A great meal in Cologne is under 10€. Aldi is a great market, as someone else said, for discount stuff, but it's quite slim pickings. The food (IMO) is a much better quality than in the US. Also - tax and tip is included in the menu price, which we aren't used to. 

Stuff like YouTube (select videos) and Hulu are not available outside of the US. Download ""hotspot shield"" a free VPN service, and you'll be up and running in 2 minutes. 

I went to a JC in the US for a year, but I'm in Cologne for work, so I can't comment on the education.

As someone who NEVER rode public transit in the states, I can tell you that it's easy as shit. For KVB (Cologne's transit), you can even buy your ticket ON some of the trains. And they come every ten minutes most of the day here, so if I miss it it's not a huge deal. The only thing that confused me is that to get some places it won't say, but you actually have to know when to get off the U-bahn and get on street level to grab a transfer train. 


As far as stereotypes, don't sweat it. I didn't know what to think either, but found myself being bought ALL my drinks at the bars by various Germans. I'm not sure if it was because they wanted to speak English, or if I was American, or Californian - but it's almost an advantage. So far here everyone is extremely friendly!! You're a female though so I'm not sure about the other side of things - though I would think it's very similar.

So far I've just taken the train to Paris (Gare du Nord) via Thalys. Germany IMO is extremely safe, but there are certain parts of Paris (train station and the whole surrounding area) that is pretty scary. Don't stop to talk to anyone at stations and keep your things close to avoid pick pockets. Paris subways are also very hectic and unlike KVB, you need to have a ticket to get into the station/go through the automatic doors. It's not surprising to see shit greeting you, melting in the hot sun at a Paris subway station or train station frequently..... Actually, avoid Paris at all costs. It's really not that great. 

Anyways, I sort of just rambled this whole spiel, but seriously, enjoy your time in Germany. 

Lastly, if you find yourself in Cologne (which I would certainly recommend), then shoot me a PM and we can grab a beer and I'll show you around. If you have any other questions about this part of Germany from an Americans perspective, just ask!

Yet, that is only seeing it from one perspective. Maybe the problem is you think they don't want to assimilate. Maybe because you see them wearing hijab or acting differently than people you are used to, that, you think they don't want to assimilate. 

Another perspective is a lot of people from the Middle East come to western countries, because they are fleeing their former country and coming to the west as refugees. It wasn't on these people's minds to have to emigrate. They weren't planning on changing their lives completely and putting themselves into a culture and society that is alien to them.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Well, there are some different opinions on whether to follow the 3% rule, but I have heard almost no one, certainly not high profile figures, using the 'but they do it too-ooo!' line, that would be childish.

Lets go by the current parties, I'd like an overview for myself too, weird situation first:


**PVV**(Partij voor de Vrijheid/Freedom Party) - Xenophobe populists (it's hard to assign them to a wing): This election anti-EU rhetoric is their way of getting seats, so they are against everything EU and want to spend as much as they want. Totally against the 3% rule and wants to leave the EU, so no fine.

At the moment 20 seats (was 24 but they lost 4 to defectors), currently 18 in the polls.


3 seats worth of PVV defectors: Still agree with PVV line on the rule

Now 3 seats, in polls none or N/A


**Groep Brinkman**: PVV Defector, who does believe in the extreme line of the PVV, but wants a party that is democratic from the inside(PVV is controlled by Geert Wilders alone) and disliked the lots of talking/no solution approach of the PVV. Still anti EU.

Now 1 seat, in the polls 1

-------------------------------------------------

**SP** (Socialistische Partij/Socialist Party): Socialists, against the 3% rule, because of what you said about spending.  Does not want to pay the fine.

Now 15 seats, in the polls 29.


**VVD** (Volkspartij voor Vrijheid en Democratie/People's party for Freedom and Democracy): Not too progressive liberals, pro business party. For maintaining the 3% rule.

Now 31 seats, in the polls 35


**PvdA** (Partij voor de Arbeid/Labour Party): Social-Democrats, does not really wants the 3% rule, but also does not want to pay the fine, so they want to negotiate a compromise on EU level with the use other non-complying countries.

Now 30 seats, in the polls 23.


**CDA** (Christelijk Democratisch Appel/Christian Democratic Appeal): Christian Democrats/conservatives, in favour of the 3% rule, or that is what we think. They got destroyed in the polls, so they are not certain of anything atm.

Now 21, in the polls 14 (They used to be the biggest party, with 40 seats or so) Working with the rude PVV scared away many 'decent Christians' who normally always vote CDA.


**D66** (Democraten '66/Democrats (1966 was the foundation year): Social-liberals/democrats/progressives/everything Fox News hates(they introduced gay marriage, drugs laws and euthanasia) : Only very pro-EU party atm, for the 3% rule.

Now 10 seats, in the polls 14 (previous election they hold 3 seats)


**GroenLinks** (Green Party): The Greens, not yet progressive liberals, not yet socialists: For the 3% rule in a compromise made after the cabinet fell, but actually would like the PvdA stance, so I take them with PvdA.

Now 10 seats, in the polls 4

**ChristenUnie** (Christian Party): Centre party in favour of a Christian led government policy. God tells you not to disobey the people that have authority over you, so they are in favour of the 3% rule.

Now 5, in the polls 5.


**SGP** (Staatkundig Gereformeerde Partij/&lt;Fundamentalist Branch of Dutch Protestantism&gt; party): Party who wants a government lead by what the (Protestant) Bible tells us. Same as CU on the 3% rule, but the group of people that followed it, actually had difficulties with not obeying the Nazis in WWII, because we did surrender to them and now they had authority over us.

Has 2 seats and will have 2 seats for as long as our little bible belt keeps existing.


**PvdD** (Partij voor de Dieren/Party for the Animals): Party founded to support animal rights. No idea what they think of the 3% rule, because they keep interrupting debates with the same questions about animals over and over.

Now 2 seats, in the polls 3.

**50+**: Party for the rights of people over 50 year old. Manned by babyboomers who want to use education funding and young people's pension money to pay for their own pensions. Greediest Party there is. Damn them all, luckily not all old people agree with them. Not sure what their opinion is on the 3% rule.

Newcomer, this is their first election, they stand in the polls on 2 seats.


This leaves us with the following result:

*now:*

Against 3% and fine:                39

Against 3% but inside EU rules:  40 (or 30 if you count GroenLinks's agreement)

For 3%:                                 69 (or 79)

Unknown:                               2\*


*Polls:*

Against 3% and fine:                48

Against 3% but inside EU rules:  27 (potentially 23 because of GL)

For 3%:                                 70 (Potentially 74)

Unknown:                               5

No side has a majority as you can see. You need 76 seats out of the 150 our parliament has. PvdA and GroenLinks are going to be decisive and the PvdA does like the Socialist Party. EU budget rules become important in the polls for the first time and you also see polarization.

In other words, the Netherlands is divided, the 12 September elections will be very tense.

Before the popular vote in 2003, the Danes had rejected the Maastrich treaty,  which probably influenced us. 

It was not clearly divided along party lines, in fact, almost all politicians said yes, while the people said no, something that is quite common with regards to our relationship with the EU/our politicians. 

The economics of it all was hotly debated though. The government Persson put several prominent economists to investigate it from a economic viewpoint (among them Lars Calmfors) and their advice was a firm no, just because of the reasons that is unraveling right now (too incompatable finances etc). So, it was a problem for the politicians, they could neither get the economists or the people along with them. Oddly enough, the Finnish government did the same, and their economists said yes :-). 

In general, I think it was mainly a Eurosceptic attitude that won, but many of the arguments they used were borrowed from Eurosceptic economists.

2) *Die Bevölkerung ist ungefähr 375,000*. While you're understood, it's a bit off. *Bevölkerung* is an abstract term (as a lot of things ending in *-ung*). A more concrete word would be number of inhabitants, *Einwohnerzahl*.

3) *sechzehnte bevölkerungsreichste Stadt* = *sechzehnt bevölkerungsreichste Stadt*. Superlative with ordinal numbers have special rules (e.g. second largest: not *zweite größte* - , but *zweitgrößte*). I'm not sure whether *sechzehnte bevölkerungsreichste* must be written as one word or it's allowed to write it with two.

4) *Ruhr ist eine Universität befindet sich in Bochum.* = *Die Ruhr-Universität befindet sich in Bochum.*

5) *Bermuda Dreieck* = *Bermudadreieck*

6) *Dreieck für Essen, einkaufen und Spaß*; all three are nouns, so all uppercase. While *für* is a mostly used as causal preposition and correct, it can sound better with other constructs.

7) *Riff ist ein sehr beliebter Club, hat Musik, Getränke und tanzen.* = *Riff ist ein sehr beliebter Club, welcher Musik, Getränke und Tanz anbietet*; you forgot the relative pronoun: der Club, masc., so *welcher*.

8) *Viele Studenten gehen hier an Wochenenden zu betrinken, aufbleiben und machen schlechte Entscheidungen.*; That's an [Infinitiv mit zu](http://www.nthuleen.com/teach/grammar/infinitivexpl.html), so: *Viele Studenten kommen an Wochenenden hierher, um sich zu betrinken, lange aufzubleiben und um (manche) falsche Entscheidung zu treffen.*; The adjective that goes better with *Entscheidung* is *falsche*, false, wrong, etc., while *schlecht* is not wrong (60K Google hits), *falsch* more common (240K Google hits).

9) *Es gibt auch Museum in Bochum.* Plural of *Musuem* is *Museen*.

10) *Bergbau Technologie* = *Bergbautechnologie*

11) *und eine Art Museum* = *und ein Kunstmuseum* or sometimes *und ein Museum der bildenden Künste*.

12) *Bochum ist nicht sehr gross in Sport*; correct: *Bochum ist nicht sehr groß im Sport*, it sounds very translated, but should be ok.

13) *Bochum hat auch das Musical Starlight Express, das ist die am längsten laufende Musical in Deutschland* = you can shorten this even a bit: *Bochum hat auch das Musical Starlight Express, das am längsten laufende Musical in Deutschland.*

14) *Wenn Sie fliegen möchten nach Bochum zu einem Besuch, fliegen Sie zum internationalen Flughafen Düsseldorf.* - it's a funny word ordering and somewhat typical for native English speakers. Alternative: *Wenn Sie nach Bochum zu einem Besuch fliegen möchten, fliegen Sie zum internationalen Flughafen Düsseldorf.*

15) *Es liegt über 45 Minuten von Bochum* = *about* in this context means *ungefähr* or *circa*, so *Es liegt circa 45 Minuten von Bochum*. (Side note: *circa* is abbreviated *ca.*)

16) *In meiner Stellungnahme, Bochum ist nicht die beste Stadt zum Auf Reisen*; At a beginner's level you'll want to start sentences, which express your opinion with *Meiner Meinung nach ...*, so: *Meiner Meinung nach ist Bochum nicht die beste Stadt für eine Reise, ...*

17) *... aber kann auch Spaß machen und ist einen Besuch wert*, in conjunction with 16): *... sie kann aber auch Spaß machen und ist einen Besuch wert*

18) *Alle ist ok mit B!* = *Alles ist ok mit B!*

Your last paragraph is just sick. If ritual slaughter of animals, physical abuse of animals, honor killings, etc, are LEGAL in your country, they are allowed to do it, just as you are. If it is NOT legal, they aren't allowed to do it, just as you aren't. It's that easy. You don't need to mix race, culture, country of born in all this.

true,modomario,BELG,Belgium - Flanders,"Belgium so far was fairly tolerable. Of course we had some anti immigrant party but it never had much success. However over the past years it has gone a bit downhill. Number showing most of the Belgian imprisoned being immigrants didn't help. Sharia for Belgium getting attention and throwing a protest didn't help either. 

My Experience with immigrants has always been a mixed one. I knew an epic Turkish girl that was very nice and an extremely arrogant Turkish dude that after starting a fight with me for no reason, claimed he just fell when i fought back and injured him. To keep me out of trouble i think.
Another case however was when a friend got in a fight with that same Turkish guy earlier but was awaited by a group of about 20 other immigrants when leaving the college later.

The problem around immigrants nowadays is that they come in with increasing numbers often following family members and the larger immigrant population causes them to form a community of their own so they don't really have to integrate. The fact that their youth seems to be a bit more assertive makes allot of difference too. Other than that they tend to pull the racist card way too fast. I had a vacation job at an attraction park and was scolded for a racist because i didn't let em on a ride that was almost full whilst we always left 2 seats open for completely different reasons. In the end i almost had to call security because even after they got their turn they stayed to cause trouble. This however is just one example. In the end there's even racism in between the Muslim immigrants themselves for some reason.

While quite a lot of post-war European migration occurred due to similar stimuli, especially the lack of labor, the unwillingness to have women enter the work force, and the constant drive for economic growth, the historical and political conditions were VERY different. A good overview can be found in Anthony Messina'a book (http://www.cambridge.org/gb/knowledge/isbn/item1150207/?site_locale=en_GB).

Recent migration is a little different, as asylum plays a bigger role, and increasingly the search for highly qualified immigrants. For example, Germany has a clause in the constitution that political and religious refugees have the right to asylum in Germany. They amended this in the mid-90s slightly, such that one has to come directly from the country persecuting you, ie air travel, but it is still valid. Obviously WW2 plays a role in this willingness.

I agree that overall it is cheaper to live in Poland than in Scotland, but not *much* cheaper. It is possible that life is just ridiculously expensive in Sweden.

This person claimed to be speaking about Islam and not Muslims. So according to what he is saying the actions or inaction by Christians are irrelevant.

But assuming if it was ontopic: Almost all European countries are democracies, our governments are secular resulting in a secular legal code. Secular societies leads to atheism or liberal religious beliefs. Religion is not pushed onto us like it is in the Middle East where almost all countries are dictatorships and/or theocracies.

&gt; If you're just going to shout racism when people mention that some assholes use religion as an excuse to act as barbarians, then you're not helping, you're just ignoring the problem.

I ""shout racism"" when people keep talking about ""Muslims"" as if all of them are the same and not individual people. Of course there are some Muslims who still aren't integrated properly in western society. Because of free speech and free religion they can uphold their beliefs but if they ever commit any crimes they will be fined or put into jail. Just like any other person would. Hopefully our secular society will (and should) eliminate religious extremism, especially in young people.

A problem we have in Europe is that there are too many people who want to alienate immigrants, especially Muslims. Which leads to extremism, crime and slums.

Well, it's not a problem for me (I've studied French in school and lived 10 months in Germany) but I see how this could be a problem for some of the readers. It's not realistic to expect that all 17502 readers of /r/europe  can understand French and German.

Also: why limit ourselves to French and German? There are interesting sources in every language, and if we accept that not everybody can understand everything, we could possibly extend the language diversity.

I think it's pretty safe to assume that the majority of the rapes are by Swedes because Swedes are the majority. This person should move to a different country because she hates Sweden. She is either extremely stupid or actually wants a Nazi society where only Swedes live. She is delusional, she thinks ""Islam"" will ""take over"" Europe.

Under Tage Erlander, right after the second world war, there was a large influx of immigrants because there was a large demand of labor for Swedish industry. The immigrants who came then comprised mostly of Turkish (including Christian Assyrians), Italian, and Yugoslav immigrants. Most of these immigrants are either assimilated or integrated in Swedish society because of two reasons. The first is that they are raised here and their parents have lived here for a long time, and the second one is that they are a part of the middle class. What are the odds that a well off person commits a street crime compared to a poor person, regardless of nationality or ethnicity?

Many immigrants are allowed to come here because of family ties, but since 2010 it is only allowed if the relative living in Sweden has enough income to support him or herself. However these rules do not apply to children and their parent(s) (these are also other circumstances where the rule doesn't apply).

The majority don't share her view. Even people who are against immigration don't hate Sweden the way she does. Even Muslim extremists like Sweden more than she does.

It can be interesting for people on /r/europe to see how the media and people see things in the country where they originated. A good example of this is the 2005 French riots, where everybody here seems to consider them to be a social class thing (poor people from the suburbs feeling like they're abused by the police and that they can't get any jobs etc.), whereas when you read English-language media reports of the event they always make it sound like it's an ethnic/religious thing (muslims vs. non-muslims or arabs vs. non-arabs, as if everybody in poor suburbs was a muslim from Northern Africa).

Another reason why articles in foreign languages are interesting is that sometimes you just can't find any English language article about something that has happened in your country, or you can only find very short articles, etc. The English and American media of course aren't as focused on each European country as the local media there, so sometimes there is an interesting bit of information that nobody knows about outside the country it originated from.

Very few jobs in said communities. stuf like nightshops, kebab restaurants, illegal employment in construction and the like yeah. But corporate jobs as engineers, network admin, teachers anything like that is out of their reach that way. 

&gt;If animal slaughter is illegal

It is unless done at a special slaughterhouse and under restrictions that the gov has created for the Muslims (No slow/painfull killing and such)(some other countries just ban it). Sadly only like 5% of the ritual slaughters last year actually happened at those places. Even with the gov handing out some more information folders.

One who wears facial coverage is already unable to apply for any job at the city hall desks or anything gov funded where you have to talk to people.

You are the one who is naive if you want to live in the past. For many people it is hard because it's a culture shock and because the loss of contacts (friends, family, etc.). It's difficult to integrate when you're surrounded by other immigrants who are poor. Nobody likes living in slums.

The way I see it is that that only hurts them. I mean, it doesn't harm anyone else, these immigrants just won't be able to do certain things unless a community exists to cater to them (maybe with taxis and lawyers and etc who speak their language).

&gt;Very few jobs in said communities. stuf like nightshops, kebab restaurants, illegal employment in construction and the like yeah. But corporate jobs as engineers, network admin, teachers anything like that is out of their reach that way.

If there's a law about this. This is more about enforcement of the law than assimilation. The law should be more strictly enforced.

For their passports which they need to live here they need a picture of their face something which caused a fight with a husband of a woman who went to a nearby city hall for said passport. He spend some days in jail so yeh. Similar stuff has happend.

So in certain instances, the face must be shown (for facial recognition purposes solely, it seems). Other than that, why can they not wear face coverings? If it's illegal to not show your face in certain instances (ID verification etc) then simply arrest those who don't comply. It doesn't really have to do with assimilation. Just law enforcement.
