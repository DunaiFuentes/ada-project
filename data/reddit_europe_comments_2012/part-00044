Oder wollen wir wieder darüber reden, ob Historiker in Wirklichkeit alle verkappte Monarchisten, Feudalisten, Nazis und sonstwas sind, weil sie über diese Dinge schreiben? 

Also hör endlich auf herumzuheulen und vor allen Dinge höre endlich auf solchen Bockmist zu schreiben. Einmal indem Du die Wahrheit schreibst, und zum zweiten indem Du ein wenig nachdenkst, bevor Du zur Tastatur greifst.

&gt; Die Arbeitslosigkeit ist unter Bush gestiegen. Fakt.

Ja, natürlich. Es gab 2008 eine Wirtschaftskrise. Die größte seit 1929. Weltweit eine gigantische Rezession. Verlieren bei dieser Rezession die Menschen weltweit ihre Arbeit? Ja. Komischerweise ist Deutschland eines der ganz wenigen Länder, bei denen das nicht so ist. Aber 2008 hat nichts mit den Wahlen 2003 zu tun, oder nicht? Fakt, Fakt, Fakt. Ohne Kontext ist das doch Schwachsinnsgelaber.

&gt; Von ""bösen"" Amerikanern sprichst nur du. 

OK, also ein Volk, welches Kriege fabriziert (also Präsidenten unabhängig von allen anderen Dingen wählt, die Kriege vom Zaun brechen, produzieren damit automatisch auch solche Präsidenten, die ständig Krieg führen) sind alles gute Menschen.

Dann musst Du aber ziemlich dumm sein. Du gehst davon aus, dass ein Krieg dem amtierenden Präsidenten bei den Wahlen helfen würde. Auch wenn die Wirtschaftsdaten katastrophal sind und dieser Krieg der Wirtschaft den Rest geben würde. Also Begründung dieser Steilen These führst Du Bush Jr. an, weil Bush Sr. genau das Gegenteil passiert ist. Und dafür nimmst Du Arbeitslose von 2008, obwohl die Wahlen für Bush Jr. 2003 waren.

Wenn Du sagst, dass Kriege schwerer wiegen als Arbeitslosigkeit und Wirtschaftswachstum, dann geht es genau darum. Vielleicht doch mal ein Beispiel. Du behauptest, Peter wäre größer als Karl, weil Peter 1,63m groß ist. Ich sage jetzt, dass aber Karl 2 Meter groß ist. Und Du sagst jetzt, dass es gar nicht darum geht, wie groß Karl ist. Fakt ist, dass Karl seine ganze Kindheit hindurch sehr klein gewesen ist. 

&gt; Du unterstellst also, dass der Ami an sich Krieg nicht führt, weil es sein muss, sondern weil es grad in die wirtschaftliche Lage passt.

Nein, ich habe nur gesagt, dass Obama die Wahlen verlieren würde, wenn im Nahen Osten jetzt Krieg ausbricht, weil dann die Konjunktur aufgrund des Ölpreises zusammenbricht. Ich sage also, wenn A (Krieg) passiert, dann folgt B (Wirfschafts-Rezession) und führt zu C (Romney wird Präsident). Und nicht wie Du jetzt behauptest, dass D (das amerikanische Volk) A (Krieg) führen will, weil es angeblich zu B (Wirtschaft) passt oder nicht. Erkennst Du den Unterschied?

It seems like a pretty bizarre thing to do. Before this the EU would have had quite a neutral relationship with Argentina, which would have been useful to them if the Falklands issue ever flared up again. The greatest risk to Britain's position is massive international condemnation, not military defeat.

Perhaps Argentina does actually believe its anti-colonial rhetoric, because in terms of realpolitik this seems a mis-step.

So the security works today, if there are people willing to invest some time to check everything.

The proof by photography is a good point, but I would argue that the unique ids add two features:

- The ids not only proof what where you put your mark, but also if you actually put the ballot in the box (if I pay you for your vote, I want to be sure, that your vote really counted)

- The ids are easier to check in an automated process, so it's easier to do this on a grand scale. It would still be hard to do on a grand scale, without drawing much attention to yourself (somehow you have to advertise the fact that you pay people for votes, but without getting caught), but this is an external aspect to the voting process itself

A third aspect to the unique id system is, it could be very hard to verify that your id is really unique. Because to be able to check this, you have to share your id with other people, which would sacrifice your anonymity.

EDIT: ok, the last issue could be solved, by making the unique id a cryptographic hash of your name+a random salt.

&gt;Es gab 2008 eine Wirtschaftskrise.

Auch da sind wir uns einig. Allerdings spreche ~~n~~ ~~wir~~ ich nicht von 2008, sondern von 2003. Und da ist die Arbeitslosigkeit gestiegen. Das ist und bleibt Fakt. Warum Bush trotzdem wiedergewählt wurde, verrate ich dir vielleicht später.

&gt;OK, also ein Volk, welches Kriege fabriziert (also Präsidenten unabhängig von allen anderen Dingen wählt, die Kriege vom Zaun brechen, produzieren damit automatisch auch solche Präsidenten, die ständig Krieg führen) sind alles gute Menschen.

Dein Problem ist, dass du deinen ausgewiesenen Anti-Amerikanismus -&gt; Antisemitismus auf andere Menschen projizierst. Wenn du dich davon lösen würdest, die vermeintlich Intention **hinter** dem Argument zu ""bekämpfen"", dann wärst du schon einen Schritt weiter. 

Von ""unabhängig von allen anderen Dingen wählen"" sprichst wieder mal **nur** du. Ebenso wie ""vom Volk, welches Kriege produziert"". (Hausaufgabe bis morgen: Nenne alle Präsidenten der USA, die **nicht** in irgendwelche Militäraktionen verwickelt waren.) 

Dazu kommt deine Unkenntnis des amerikanischen Wahl- und Politiksystems. Das ""Volk"" entscheidet natürlich nicht direkt über Krieg oder nicht Krieg. Selbst wenn(!) man annähme, dass die Entscheidung bei der Wahl **ausschließlich** zwischen Krieg und nicht Krieg fiele, bräuchte man nicht ""das Volk"", sondern nur eine Mehrheit. 

Du solltest deine rassistische Denkweise ablegen oder wenigstens darauf verzichten, eben diese Denkweise auf andere Menschen zu projizieren. Damit erleidest du nur immer neue Bauchlandungen. (Deine Lernresistenz diesbezüglich ist allerdings beachtlich.)

&gt;Nein, ich habe nur gesagt, dass Obama die Wahlen verlieren würde, wenn im Nahen Osten jetzt Krieg ausbricht, weil dann die Konjunktur aufgrund des Ölpreises zusammenbricht.

&gt; Tatsächlich würde ein Krieg wohl eher den typisch patriotischen Ungeist der US-Amerikaner wecken und Obama (bzw. generell dem amtierenden Präsidenten) eher nützen.

Du sprichst vom ""typisch patriotischen Ungeist"". Es ist also nicht nur ein patriotischer Ungeist, sondern dieser ist auch typisch für Die Amis. 

Und dann gehst Du noch weiter, und behauptest, dass dieser Effekt für einen Krieg [weit weg von zu Hause](http://www.murdoconline.net/2007/americaisatthemall-thumb.jpg) stärker ist, als die Wirtschaft. Ich habe nie behauptet, dass es keinen rally 'round  the flag effect gibt. Nur, dass er nicht so stark ist wie die Wirtschaftsdaten. It's the economy, stupid!

Nebenher, obwohl Antisemitismus, Rassismus und Islamfeindlichkeit durchaus Ähnlichkeiten aufweisen und verwandt sind, sind es doch unterschiedliche Dinge. Niemand würde dem Grass jetzt Rassismus vorwerfen. Oder dem Geert Wilders Antisemitismus. 

Die Phänomene des Antiamerikanismus und des Antisemitismus sind dagegen stark verwandt, wie ich bereits erwähnte.

&gt; Deine Pöbelei sagt nur etwas über dich aus. Wer keine Argumente hat, pöbelt rum.

Sagt, der, der mich die ganze Zeit des Rassismus bezichtigt? Jedenfalls bleibe ich dabei, dass Pöbelei einer Diskussion wesentlich mehr zuträglich ist als jemand, der ständig wissentlich Schwachsinn von sich gibt. Denn ich weiß nie, ob Du Dich selbst überhaupt noch ernst nimmst. Deshalb immer meine Frage: Wie alt bist Du? Redest Du wieder Mist, oder weißt Du es einfach nicht besser.

&gt; Allerdings spreche n wir ich nicht von 2008, sondern von 2003. Und da ist die Arbeitslosigkeit gestiegen.

Wann genau hast Du das nachgeguckt? Ehrlich mal! 

Übrigens sind schon Mitte 2003 viele der Bush-Steuersenkungen in Kraft getreten, die der Wirtschaft einen ordentlichen Schub verpasst haben. Steuergeschenke zur Wahl sind vielleicht doch ein wirksameres Mittel, als Kriege? Auch in den USA? Langfristig erwiesen sich diese Steuersenkungen als fatal, was damals schon vorhergesagt wurde. Aber kurzfristig haben sie vor den Wahlen im September Bush den Hintern gerettet.

&gt; Dazu kommt deine Unkenntnis des amerikanischen Wahl- und Politiksystems. Das ""Volk"" entscheidet natürlich nicht direkt über Krieg oder nicht Krieg. Selbst wenn(!) man annähme, dass die Entscheidung bei der Wahl ausschließlich zwischen Krieg und nicht Krieg fiele, bräuchte man nicht ""das Volk"", sondern nur eine Mehrheit. 

Dann aber ja doch. Wenn die Wahl ausschließlich von Krieg und Frieden abhängt, wie Du es hier die ganze Zeit behauptest, dann entscheidet das Volk (oder von mir aus die Mehrheit) über Krieg und Frieden. Und genau das versuchst Du die ganze Zeit hier zu verkaufen. Ich kaufe aber nicht. Das ist Anti-Amerikanismus in Reinform, was Du hier von Dir gibst. Kein Rassismus und keine Islamfeindlichkeit.

A lot of countries subsidise their own industries for the export market. There are a lot of different ways to subsidise your industry. For example: Europe and the US have a long history of squabble over the aircraft industry. While Europe has direct subsidies, the US has arms contracts with Boeing, that (in Europes eyes) greatly overpay their own industry for the arms they purchase and thus subsidises Boeing.

The fact is that people who earn this kind of money do so because they rely on the work of others. And so if they refuse to distribute this money throughout their company by raising the revenue of others or investing it, it's normal that this money is put to good use. It may as well be collected by the state to be for example redistributed as business grants or as anything else that benefits society. It's a healthy system. I never thought about it before he proposed it this year, but I find it completely logical and harmless. I think it would really encourage people to re-invest this cash into their companies instead of keeping it for themselves (and instead of seeing the state grab it), which would generate tones of benefits the first of which being cash flow to hire with.

true,jinnyjuice,null,null,"Actually, in contrast to instinctive conclusion that raising minimum wage will increase unemployment, it will actually decrease it in the longer run. Here is a simple explanation to the theory:

* Minimum wage is raised *drastically* (for sake of explaining)

* Some (mostly inefficient) workers get laid off

* Some people enjoy the raised wage (most likely efficient/educated workers)

* Those efficient/educated workers would probably put money to better use

* Economy is stimulated better from educated people instead of the inefficient workers spending less useful stuff

* Companies start hiring the laid off workers again because of the stimulus

Why would this not cause inflation? It's because velocity of GDP is increased or is used more efficiently, not increased income in general, though because of the stimulus, people will have more income anyway.

EDIT: this is exactly what happened in the US. Minimum wage in US was increased ~40%(?) in the course of about 3 years (2008 to 2011?), but don't quote me on that; it's an approximation from what I remember. It used to be somewhere between $5-6, now its' $7.50.

After that we studied some selected parts of ""Mein Kampf"" and deduced his ideas and goals. We worked with a lot of primary sources in general, analyzing how Hitler promoted his ideology using propaganda and education and were encouraged to approach his ideas and methods critically.

We did a teeny bit about how he used the SS/SA, espionage and so on to suppress opposition, mostly focusing on how they interfered with everyday life. 

About 60+ percent must have been about the Holocaust and the aftermath though, and the war aspect of WW2 was completely drowned out and had to be cut short because of time issues since we had to move on to the Holocaust. The closest we got to learning about the war was doing a time line, but we were aware of the alliances and factions.

true,bigos,SILE,"a bird on a flag ","I see that it could work in the US this way, with their approach to social security. It is (the social security) very limited there unlike European states, Poland included.

I guess, in Europe a state would have to compensate/aid laid off workers, for a time at least. The more workers are laid off, the more aid the state would have to issue. That would, in turn, translate into more taxation, because these money have to come from somewhere, so we would probably see some new, creative taxes. These taxes are the reason why we wouldn't experience so much of a GDP growth.  

So what would in reality happen is just changing distribution system to less efficient. Some wages wouldn't be paid, so some taxes wouldn't flow in. What's more is that now formerly working ""minimum wage slave"" is now unemployed and requires aid. He receives this aid from a state, which, in turn receives it from employee former employer. And the states get it's cut, too. In the end, the laid-off worker gets less and is unproductive, the rest has to work harder for the same wage, the employer's life just got harder, because he has to manage with less resources. And that's a net loss for a country, too, because who was once employed, taxed and productive, in however minimal amount is now dependent on social aid.

It is now the question if the expected profits are not caught into the social security net. I think they would be, and we would never see them again.

The one for poetry? Because the economics certainly does stack up.

For a start increased wages will eventually be passed on to the consumer via higher prices as businesses are unlikely to reduce their profit margins. So those at the bottom who get dragged up to the minimum now face higher bills so overall their net change will in all likelihood be zero.

The problem then is that those who were previously above minimum wage but now aren't often suffer as there is little incentive to increase their wages. This can lead to a lot of problems over the long term.

2. Ruit Auf Den Fildern, Baden-Wurttemberg, Deutschland-  8 km southeast of Stuttgart. 

3. My father was commander of Stuttgart Army airfield. He was to return home several days days before my paperwork to leave could be done. I almost had to stay.

4. I grew up in America, but deeply immersed in German culture. The freedom of mind, ability to think logically, desire for order, care for others, and ingenuity that the German people have is far different from the selfish/slave mind that most Americans have. 

5. The education system here in America is terrible. I have failed in this society because of my hatred for being taught misinformation and being babysat to earn a diploma. Schooling here is so that you can be out of the way, and be taught how to think as a herd of idiots to not question any ""authority."" 
Easiest?
I am dirt poor, but I have it better than most people around the world. America is spoiled beyond comprehension. 

6. Most of my relatives have moved here generations ago,(father's side is almost pure Irish with scottish mixed in, an my mothers is mostly from Holland and other Germanic speaking countries) but there are some still living around Germany that I see at reunions. 

7. I have not gone back yet, but I plan to as soon as I am able to fund the trip. 

8. I live in an economic bubble filled with scientists and engineers working at the [Hanford Site](http://www.hanford.gov/).  There is a diverse mix of European cultures that overwhelm the stereotypical American culture today, though most of us live in a 90's/80's neighborhood friendly area, unlike most of America where people will not ever see their neighbor. 

9. My father and Mother, with two older brothers and a sister, have spent much more time in Germany than I have. They went to school there during the fall of the wall, and have returned quite often to visit friends and work. 

0. I miss the culture: where you can leave a baby out side of the store, and someone will walk by to comfort it, and return it while you are in the store. Everyone is caring like this. Best of all.... My ocd fits in quite well. 

1. I was bullied through elementary and middle school for being a ""Nazi."" I had no friends because I had a tough time with English, and they all thought I would throw them in an oven. 

People blame the German people for the past, they don't blame the groups behind everything. We feel bad because other's don't look at us for who we are, but for because of  who some others used to be. It's blaming the son for the father's mistake. The son is obviously going to be troubled by that.  

I failed english from middle scool to high school. (Theirs so many exceptions, and ridiculous rules) Though english was my first language, and I am fluent, German cam to me easier. I wasn't allowed to take German in middle school, or the beggining of high school because I failed english. (No logical sense there) 

I then graded over 100% in German each year, skipping levels because I was so good. I still failed my English classes. American schools suck. 


I'd be obliged to answer more questions. I am sorry if these are not in depth enough. I'm not always sure how to answer. If you need me to be more clear, I can do so.

You're severely overestimating their power. Besides, here in Europe, the backlash of that would be the company's death, a company here without any regard for social issues is just at a disadvantage, even strictly-financially speaking.

&gt;Minimum wage might even go down.

That's pure speculation and it's also disconnected from reality. Honestly, who's the politician that would suggest with a straight face the minimum wage should be reduced and expect to be elected into office?

And let's be honest, Germany and Austria don't have any minimum wage. Are they in a bad situation or at least in a worse situation than we in Portugal with 485€*14months/year or those in Greece with 750€?

&gt;This is why I advocate seizing the whole company as well. 

Well, you advocate wrongly. Explain me, how is the public sector capable of running an economy when all his enterprises are the ones presenting the most negative results? Not to mention that even if they presented good results (they never do), what would be their incentive to do better for society if there's no risk or no dependable profit for them?

&gt;But don't worry - Bribes are flowing and oiling the system. Your horror of of corporations having to pay more than Chinese wages will never happen. 

Again, fear-mongering and detachment from reality. Bribes aren't flowing around at least as frequently as you mention as there's always considerable competition from other politicians and media vultures trying to capitalize on corrupt politicians to either seize their places or profit from their scandals.

Also, nobody's advocating for Europeans to receive the same as Chinese, their completely different things. They are in slavery-like conditions mass producing cheap products, obviously you can't compete with them on that (because lousy unions, lol, I'm just joking now), not that you even want to.

That's ancient history (and not even then, none was paying minimum wage back then anyway, they would hire you as if you had your own business and pay you business rate i.e 300 euros per month). Minimum wages went down in Greece a couple of times as well in the past years, and this is just a start.  So I am speculating based on previous history. 
I have friends working for 100 euro/month (they apparently fall under ""businessmen"" in the new doublespeak).

2 close to Cologne, Northrhine-Westfalia
3 2006/2007 for an exchange year at an american high-school  
4 Everybody was very friendly and talkactive right away. It was very easy to talk to people and once they heard about the new exchange student everyone would come talk to me. We had some exchange students at our school in germany and everybody would just kind of acknowledge them but not go straight up to them and talk to them. Oh yes and many people would call me Nazi, ask if Hitler was still alive, what language we speak in Germany or if we also have TVs at home...     
5 Everybody was pretty shallow so it was difficult finding close friends you could really trust. Everyone would say ""i love you"" right after just meeting me (takes a long time in germany until someone tells you that), or asking ""how are you"" in the hallway and than not even waiting for my answer, which confused me at first ;) People would talk to me like they were my best friends and then not even say hi the next day or as soon as I was not interesting anymore for being foreign. However, whereas it was difficult to find close friends, it was very easy to have small talk with people you hardly knew, because everybody was so friendly. Oh yes another thing that shocked me was how many kids would drink alcohol...coming to the states with having the fact in mind that drinking alcohol under 21 was illegal, i was surprised at how many kids would not care about it. and also i don't only mean general things like partying but literally bringing wodka to school, being completly wasted in class or been to rehab before...that was just...wow, something i did not expect.  
6 ...   
7 I live in germany   
8 not really...i guess there was like a ""beer fest"" once but that's debatable in which aspects that really ""german"". One strange fact was that around christmas time people kept telling me about the ""german pickle"" which apparently is an ornament that you put in your christmas tree and the first children of the family that finds it gets an extra gift. i have never heard of such a thing before, neither has any german i've ever asked about it.     
9 my parents came to visit me and they liked it very much. They travelled around and has fun times with random encounters with strangers who were really friendly 
10 I like staying in the States, however now being a little bit older I would probable not want to move there. The highschool was ridiculous. On my first day I was moved to the AP English class...just ridiculous since english is not my mother tongue and i was considered to be just an average student in my english class in germany. In general the classes for foreign languages were ridiculous, you didn't learn anything about grammar or speaking a language, but rather make movies, listening to songs or play games. However, my math classes and biology classes were quite good, although none of the students were motivated. Another thing that annoyed me very much was the whole debate about what was appropriate to sing/do/read religiously (saying happy holidays instead of merry christmas blabla) and the whole creationism thing..don't even get me started... ;)
HOWEVER what i liked about the american school was, that you could take classes like drama, film making and choir, which is not really possible in germany. 
10 i missed the GERMAN BREAD! right now i can't really think of other things....however when i came back i suddenly noticed how unfriendly everyone was (in the post office, when ordering a coffee, at the airport)...so..hmm...i guess not everything is great in germany ;)

 I was staying in a rural area in WV, therefore everything seemed kinda relaxed and laid back to me. My hostdad drove through the town and could name nearly everyone on the streets. As I come from a big town, I'm not used to that and kinda liked it. Later on, I had to learn that ot everything is gold that shines and that people like talking behind ones back. DOn't take me wrong, that happens here all the time too, but it seems to me as if it was to a bigger extend and that gossip takes ""bigger circles"" (don't know a better way to put this).
 Hardest: Seriously, I freaking missed the beer. Additionally, I missed nightlife. Over here (coming from a big city) I can go to bars and clubs the whole night. In WV the only things we were able to do were fishing, the movies, go to the bowling alley and eat at restaurants. 

The easiest: I quickly made new friends and became part of the highschool football team. Almost everyone welcomed me with open arms and would help me if I needed anything. I loved that.

Do you still keep in touch with your ~~German relatives~~ American hostfamily? Not as much as I wished, I mostly only talk to my hostmom every now and then.

How often do you still go back to ~~Germany~~ America? I haven't visited since, but I'm planning on doing so in August.

Have you found aspects of German culture here (on TV, the media, food, activities, other German people)? Activities: Soccer was getting bigger and more people were interested in it than I had expected.  TV: Most TV shows were the same as in Germany but that's because we watch American shows. Food: I don't really think Germany has 'german' dishes. 

What has been the experience of other members of your family? --

What do you miss most about Germany? BEER. Really, why can't u make beer that doesn't taste like water?

Things that might turn out to be problems for a newbie to flatshares:
Chores. 

a) your flatmates might be lazier than you and you might feel uncomfortable in the flat.

b) the other way round. Be aware that WG's usually have not cleaner, you will be expected to clean the loo and do the dishes at times when you would rather study. 

c) Communication and social enviroment. You will find out that the hierarchic structure and family bond make a family work much easier. Somebody is the head of a family, somebody the youngest child everybody agrees on who's the boss. When you fight, next day you can forgive each other. In a flatshare everything needs much more discussions. That's not a bad thing, it might even be more fair to the younger members, but it might seem rather exhausting, when you don't expect discussing the telephone bill for hours.

Bank bailouts - according to the free market, shouldn't be bailed because they failed on their own. According to our law, we shouldn't need to bail them out in the first place because they would be regulated enough not to compromise its clients savings.
Bribing scandals - are you British? I haven't seen that many, at least here in Portugal. Most of those here are regarding football, and I couldn't care less about those.
Suicides - oh, FFS! Are you serious? Blaming a socio-economic system for suicides? Really, treat yourself. And visit countries like Cuba or Venezuela, see how much happier they are there.
R&amp;D budgets - talk to your policy makers, its them who decide that, not individuals or small business.
Subsidies to megacorps and military budgets - tell me, in which Europe do you live in? It sure sounds like you're talking about that country next to Canada, not about an European nation.

&gt;We are returning to neo-feudalism, and unless it's stopped, in a couple of years you will envy china for their ""formidable working condiations"". 

More fear-mongering detached from reality. Bah, really, Europe, the next China? Don't make me laugh!

&gt;Yes, they are really outdoing themselves. If there was a brib-o-meter, it would be hitting red now. 

If that's true, then by all means, present proof. Don't do it to make an argument, make it to improve life for everyone in society by exposing corruption. Till then, I'll just assume you're living in perpetual fear and fighting ghosts, assuming everyone is out to get you, conspiring and planning your downfall. lol, there are bribes everywhere, you just can't prove it, isn't it?

&gt;This is not strictly true, but any case I think people should be directly responsible for state enterprises (you know, the ones too big to fail). Everyone should be issued stock (which he cannot sell, as an obligation and right of him being a citizen of a country) and voting rights, with some proportion with the workers of those companies. They are needed to maintain life, they shouldn't belong to anyone (just like air).

It's true at least here, state owned companies are the ones who constantly present astronomical results. To bad they're always negative and it's the taxpayer that has to pay the bill.

Regarding the ""owned by society"" thing, it's just extremely impractical, I'm assuming that getting consensus between 20 shareholders is very difficult to do, getting consensus between everyone is just impossible. And telling that people would be forced to own those companies is just ludicrous, you'd give someone clearly irresponsible and not interested the same voice as someone deeply committed in the decision-making process?

Besides, now this is just my personal opinion, but voting rights and civil rights should be just that, rights, not something enforceable by law if a citizen just isn't interested. If you make it an obligation, he'll just not give a shit and the whole society would be harmed. Just like people have the the right to exercise their rights, they also should have the right not to, IMO.",0,1334693648,null,0,false,0,c4dfcp3,t3_se2r6,t1_c4dfcp3,t1_c4ddqzv,null,1428741489,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

I haven't used them, but colleagues have -- some were happy with it (getting a moderately decent apartment with a premium cost), but there's definitely the risk of not being able to see it first.

seloger.fr is a site that's only used by agencies, and lets you search for furnished and unfurnished apartments. Most will be 1 year rentals, but I'm sure there's some 6month stuff in there as well. They restrict the phone number for new listings for three days unless you pay; you can hack around that if you use the mobile app (which doesn't impose the restriction).

pap.fr only has private listings, and not as many photos, but is another good resource. Keep in mind that if you're renting through an individual, he or she may ask for a financial guarantor, or a year's rent in escrow.

I recommend using something like airBNB when you first hit the ground, and then getting the numbers of all of the agencies you can find off of seloger.fr and calling them with your exact demands. Most of them will have someone who can speak english, and will want to rent their places out :)

The 100/euros a month I was referring to was from a friend of mine being a taxi driver in Athens (obviously not by choice) after 15/hours per day work (and yes, you can imagine that he did search for all kinds of shitty jobs). It's that bad.  As a side note taxi drivers in pre-crisis hit Greece were making something like 1500euro/month by renting the taxi.

That's a problem with your legal system, not with the socioeconomics of the EU.

&gt;They gave it to the Greek banks that are essentially bankrupt.

Well, they shouldn't. I mean, they also shouldn't let those you deposited their savings there lose everything, but fuck, bailing out banks shouldn't be happening in the first place! They should be the most regulated activity because them screwing up make things worse for everyone else, and clearly we've all not being doing our homework by letting the financial sector not having enough liquid assets, but then again, if the legal system was working properly, this wouldn't be an issue in the first place.

&gt;Yes of course. Every form of democracy is impractical to people like you. You would prefer an efficient King.

And you prefer demagogy and insulting those who disagree with you, already making wild assumptions about the other person arguing with you.

btw, you didn't answer the difficulties I mentioned about your system, how would you make everyone reach a consensus regarding every state owned enterprise that you said should belong to everyone and how would you deal with those just not interested in taking part in any of it (since you said everyone would be obliged to do their part)?

Through the 80's and 90's we moved back and forth, living in such places as Bad Nauheim, Mannheim, Frankenthal, and Friedberg. Before moving permanently to the states, we lived in Frankenthal from 1991 to 1994(Roughly).

1.     With moving back and forth, keeping in contact with my German friends was difficult. This was well before the advent of the internet, Facebook, etc. Getting anywhere here is a pain the ass. We lived closeby to everything, and you just needed to walk down the street to get anything you needed, and if you needed to, transportation was widely available to you. That is not the case here, unless you live in a very very large city, like NY.

A story she tells is from the first year she lived here on JBLM (Or Ft. Lewis at is was called just a few short years ago), where the neighbor women seemed to be talking about the trials and tribulations of those around them. Affairs, medical conditions, etc. My Mom felt that it was none of their business to gossip about the neighborhood, until she found out they were just talking about the most recent Soap Operas from TV.

Of course not, because someone still has to clean the toilets.

This is called the ""race to the bottom"" and it has been a problem in Asia for decades already.    Companies from the West look for someone to make their product, and factories in the East compete by saying ""we offer shittier wages, we have our people work longer, for less"".  

That's the desire of the capitalist system, to get the most production for the least money.   The only thing stopping that, is the governments of the world representing the wishes of it's people.     If capitalism had it's way, wages would go down to the bare minimum to keep the workers alive.    Business is not interested in quality of life, it is only interested in the profit margin.

It is the government, elected by the people, to represent the people, that should be forcing business to treat it's employees fairly.

I am German and I'm living in the US for a year, working and enjoying life. I'm going back tho in June, but I'll try to help :)

* Vivien Jezebel weird-philipino-lastname
* Born in Heilbronn, BaWue
* After I made my Abitur in Germany, I originally wanted to study right afterwards. But I had a hardr time deciding what to do, so I made plans to visit my Dad in the States, since I have a dual-citizenship and it would be very convenient. It was all about growing up, being away from home and seeing this from a different point of view, and making friends all over the world.
* Living in Los Angeles, California, is probably a little bit different from other cities in the states. Everybody is very concerned about health and sports, and it really worries me that everybody (including my family here, but I think it's a growing trend in Germany, too) is taking supplements of weird stuff instead of just eating healthier.
On the other hand a huge amount of people are vegans here, eating all the good stuff.
Everybody seems very kind here, even it it is just about selling stuff to you, but I appreaciate it that people ask about you and chat with people in lines and stuff like that.
What I see alot is that work is destroying a lot of families here. The parents work too hard, the kids are in hands of other people, just eat shitty food, and nobody takes the time in the regular everyday life to take care of a nice family life, like taking walks or going to the beach.
* I had a hard time finding a job in such a short time (although I ended up working in a small german deli now :) ), and probably because of my personality, I had a hard time finding good friends.
* In the beginning I skyped a lot with family, and with help of smartphones and easy free messanging apps I was in permanent contact with friends.
* I come to America every other year for a few weeks or so.
* I am working in a german deli so I have contact to Germans everyday.
I often meet pleople which have studied in Germany or go there even frequently for vacation or even work, and at least everybody knows some german vocabulary (during a sports game someone was cursing in German xD!).
Foodwise: Trader Joes sells a LOT of German stuff (I think they originated from Aldi?), so I enjoy that.
* I was going here alone and my family here is not German at all ;) Unfortunately schools are kinda poor around here, they have to make gifts for the teachers so they can buy stuff, they have to cut weeks of school of the kids (my sis is in 3rd grade), and you have to pay a lot of money if you want your kid to be on a good dpschool, and that matters a lot (or say it seems like it does).
* First I didnt like it, I thought everybody is fake here, and I had a hard time finding friends. Now that I achieved that, I LOVE it, I love that Outdoor Cult, everybodies surfing, hiking, snowboarding, or something else, working out, and I participate as well! Of course I miss my forests, rivers and lakes, but the beach is pretty awesome, too.
* What I miss most about Germany? A true family life, and my friends. And maybe that everything is a little closer together (LA is HUGE).
* Germans: Give America a chance! There is no such thing as ""THE AMERICAN"" and it really depends with whom you are around! Just keep loking and you'll find your folks ;) And come visit me in LA!

In the meantime, every time a new idea is made to implement something that would benefit all of the EU and its citizens, a small minority (which unfortunately is all it takes to screw something up) will always gut the law/regulation so that it cannot actually do anything useful...

Well, this topic is being discussed for a couple of years already.

&gt; Fact is, he proposes, completely straight-faced, that now is the time for stimulus, lots of it, otherwise: complete and utter doom! 

Yes, that's what theory suggests. Note that theory doesn't say that there won't be problems in future even if you do stimulus.

&gt; And I simply pointed out (okay, I wrote a long wall of text) that he's missing the other side of this discussion: the net-paying Eurocore nations want some form of guarantee that the net-receivers change their failed policies. How do you respond to that point?

If they said ""we can tolerate higher inflation, but you need this, this and this for us to give you money"" there wouldn't be a problem.

Instead they demand austerity NOW. Which kills the economy, according to Krugman.

Either you or me misunderstand this debate.

By the way, what ""failed policies"" resulted in housing bubbles? Should they had, like, strangled lending?

If there is a need for policy change, it should be a global, EU-wide policy. E.g. some global bank guarantee fund for failing banks. And recommendation for states to NOT save banks when they fail.

How do you jump from ""trial"" to ""show trial""?

Otherwise, if the government really does suspect that the law was broken when the contract was signed, we use the proper legal channels to challenge the contract.  Why is this such a hard concept to understand?

Ridiculous.  Your own personal political philosophy is not fact.  Stop presenting it as if it is so.

If you are an individual professional, for example an artist, who ends up earning large amounts (over the cap), I would see it fit that this money doesn't go in your personal pocket but gets used to create new companies, develop training. If you're a singer you can promote other smaller artists, put together cultural events, create a label etc. There's always a million things that could use money.

There was no strawman argument.  Do you know what that phrase means?  You presented your political opinion as if it was fact.  It isn't fact.

&gt; unnecessary and illegal intrusion into private property by government

How do I end up debating against ancaps all the time? What have I ever done to you all? Okay, yes, whatever, private property is the highest principle. 

You probably do protest against interventionism and I salute you for that, but I couldn't know who you are. It's a fact of life that governments and their people do protest against unilateral moves by other governments but cheer for their own unilateral moves. That's the hypocrisy I wanted to point out and even though it doesn't apply to you personally (I apologise for putting it like that) I'm sure it applies to a lot of people that on your side on this issue.

&gt; Then by your own standards the infrastructure developed by the oil company in question in Argentina was a possession, and you are hoisted by your own petard.

The definition was more about people. For corporations I guess things become more complicated. Sorry about the confusion. 

&gt; How can you legitimately claim that you are not a Statist nor an authoritarian when you support and welcome the illegal and immoral seizing of private property by a government?

Lesser of two evils. It's the same reason I vote. A lot of good things for the common people have been achieved by subverting the power of the state. At any rate, in this specific instance the contest is between two states and their satellite companies. But even if we assume that the Spanish government and Repsol are somehow completely independent of each other, then the contest is between a big company and the government of Argentina. Guess which one I believe is more loyal to the interests of the people of Argentina. If the contest was between the government of Argentina and Argentinian citizens, I wouldn't take the government's side in principle (obviously, it also depends on the issue etc).",0,1334749222,null,0,false,0,c4dolsm,t3_se1ch,t1_c4dolsm,t1_c4doh3l,null,1428745925,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Both are possible reasons to me: For the first, there is a long history for contracts like that being pretty imbalanced so a priori this is what I'm going to believe, even in the absence of specific evidence. 

For the second, I'm not actually totally convinced myself: States are big powerful constructs, nationalisations just consolidate their power. On that we agree. However, they have been used consistently through history to achieve better living conditions for the populace, look at the labour movement for instance; their efforts culminated in government-enforced laws. And there's also the issue that the people do have some control over their government with the elections and their votes. So, it's a fine line to tread: no one wants to see free association diminished in the wake of ultra-powerful states. But at the same time their absence leads to all sorts of trouble, everything from widespread inequality to economic catastrophe. In our modern world, the latter seems more of a credible threat than the former.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;I use the term to mean promotion of free market policies, with little or no government oversight, combined with a strong class conscience from the rich.

Yes, but it didn't happen, that's the point! If the average European economy went 10 grades ""left"" by 1965, compared to 1900, then after 1980 it moved 1 or 2 grades ""right"" so what are people actually complaining about? The only significant change was privatisation. Deregulation on the whole did not happen, in fact environmental etc. regulation is now stricter than in 1980. And taxes are somewhat lower but spending isn't so it is debt i.e. future taxes.

This is why I consider Neoliberalism a no-term. Very, very little actually happened. The general framework is still social democracy.

I mean if the highest tax rate would be 15%, healthcare privatized and environmental rules rolled back, then yes, that would have been a free market reform. But nothing like that happened. There were no truly serious rollbacks of the government size in any European country, except for privatisations. So what are people even talking about? Statism was in some aspects somewhat relaxed. Is that a free market? Is that Neoliberalism? That is almost nothing.

This is what I don't get. The system is still Social Democracy, just a tad bit more market-conform in a few fields.

For those who'd stay -- more power to them, the minimum wage intention has fulfilled it's role. They were underpaid and now they're less underpaid. Note that this doesn't change tax revenue much. 

As for the rest, my post still applies. So whatever the percentage may be (between 1% sacked and 100% sacked) there is still loss included, just scaled down, because the increased profit will be consumed by welfare services anyway. 

And the benefit, well, the only one I can think of is helping underpaid workers to renegotiate their contract. And I don't think it's state's job to do this.

Actually, I think we agree that a way for ""minimum wage slaves"" to improve their income is to reeducate themselves. Whether they are sacked because of implementing high minimum wage or not, to be profitable to pay them more they need to improve their marketable skills.

Why implement the minimum wage then? They need to reeducate either way.",0,1334757937,null,0,false,0,c4dpqhb,t3_se2r6,t1_c4dpqhb,t1_c4docqr,null,1428746461,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

For comparison: in the last legislative elections, in 2009, PASOK got 44% and New Democracy 33%, leaving the smaller parties scrambling for the remaining 23%. Now, the two main parties pool just 37% or 40% of the vote, according to these two polls, and a majority of Greeks intend to vote for one of the smaller parties.

Wikipedia has [more details](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_legislative_election,_2012#Opinion_polls) on that latest poll, and other recent ones. 

Looks like the far left (KKE and Syriza) and the far right (LAOS and XA) are benefiting significantly from the crisis, pooling up to 20% and 10% of the vote, respectively.

Given that it's the state's role to protect the rights of the weak against exploitation by the strong, I think it is.

Because being on a very low wage job leaves very few avenues for self-improvement.

With the scenario of a coalition government after the elections from the two major parties (something that almost all the voters are certain about) and the fact of the ""revenge"" vote, my opinion is that the Greek people do not really seek a change in the political map of the country. They still want the two major players in the game but a bit weaker as a sign of frustration. Since it's certain they will rule together it's also easier for the voters to express that frustration in their vote and still be on the safe side that the country will not fall apart as the ongoing propaganda is suggesting in case that someone else is ruling the country.

Und wieder versuchst du es mit persönlichen Angriffen. 

&gt;Denn ich weiß nie, ob Du Dich selbst überhaupt noch ernst nimmst. 

Hübsche Ausrede. Du weißt natürlich, dass mein ""Schwachsinn"" sich lediglich und ausschließlich auf deinen billigen Versuch bezog, die Antisemitismuskeule zu schwingen. Du dachtest halt, die Diskussion damit gleich abwürgen zu können. Nicht deine einzige Fehleinschätzung.

&gt;Deshalb immer meine Frage: Wie alt bist Du? Redest Du wieder Mist, oder weißt Du es einfach nicht besser.

Das ist eine geradezu groteske Aussage von jemandem mit deiner Erziehung und deiner Bildung. 

Ich rate dir, lass es einfach sein. Widerlege meine Argumente. Damit hast du mehr als genug zu tun. 

Nun zum Thema: 

&gt;Du sprichst vom ""typisch patriotischen Ungeist"". Es ist also nicht nur ein patriotischer Ungeist, sondern dieser ist auch typisch für Die Amis.

Es gibt außer (ich glaube) Venezuela kein Land, in dem der Patriotismus extremer ausgeprägt ist. Auch das ist wissenschaftlich gut untersucht. Du leugnest Fakten.

Und ja, ich halte Patriotismus, ganz egal von wem, [für höchst albern](http://i.imgur.com/zD4C2.jpg), dem Wesen nach für chauvinistisch und im Sinne der Manipulierbarkeit der Massen auch für gefährlich. 

&gt;Und dann gehst Du noch weiter, und behauptest, dass dieser Effekt für einen Krieg weit weg von zu Hause stärker ist, als die Wirtschaft.

Richtig. Genau wie bei Bush Junior auch. 

&gt;Ich habe nie behauptet, dass es keinen rally 'round the flag effect gibt. Nur, dass er nicht so stark ist wie die Wirtschaftsdaten.

Tja, und ich behaupte das Gegenteil. Nachweisbar ist, dass zu Beginn des Irak-Kriegs die Zustimmung für Bush geradezu sensationell angestiegen ist. Und natürlich hast du den rally 'round the flag effect nicht abgestritten. Du hattest ja gar keine Ahnung, dass er überhaupt existiert. Eben weil es dir bei der Diskussion gar nicht um Erkenntnisgewinn geht, sondern um Pöbelei.

&gt;Steuergeschenke zur Wahl sind vielleicht doch ein wirksameres Mittel, als Kriege?

Möglicherweise. Fakt ist, dass die Zustimmung für Bush (bis auf sehr kurze Peaks, z.B. eben dem Irak-Krieg) während beider Amtszeiten nur einen Trend kannte: nach unten. Das bedeutet nun nach deiner Hypothese entweder, dass es auch mit der Wirtschaft dauerhaft bergab ging  - was nach deiner Aussage allerdings nicht so war - oder aber, dass es eben nicht nur nach Kassenlage geht. 

Du musst dich halt mal von deinem anti-amerikanischen Vorurteil lösen, dass es dem Ami immer nur ums Geld geht. 

&gt;Sagt, der, der mich die ganze Zeit des Rassismus bezichtigt?

Andersrum. **Du** hast dich selbst des Anti-Amerikanismus bezichtigt. [Und zwar hier.](http://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/s3mn3/taking_german_chauvinists_down_a_peg/c4axnqt) Und damit bist du natürlich auch des Antisemitismus verdächtig. Was bei anderen richtig ist, kann bei dir nicht falsch sein. 

&gt;Wenn die Wahl ausschließlich von Krieg und Frieden abhängt, dann entscheidet das Volk (oder von mir aus die Mehrheit) über Krieg und Frieden.

Auch das nicht. Dann entscheidet nur der Teil der Wähler über Krieg und Frieden, der eben diesem rally 'round the flag effect unterliegt. Das bedeutet nicht, dass für, sagen wir mal, 30 Prozent der ""Kriegspräsidentenwähler"" nicht auch andere Dinge (=Wirtschaft) im Vordergrund stehen können. 

&gt;Und genau das versuchst Du die ganze Zeit hier zu verkaufen.

true,fjonk,null,null,"Hello there. I've lived in Barcelona a couple of months now and I speak very little Spanish. These are the tips I can give you.

Pickpocking: Yes, pickpockets does exist, and they're pretty fucking good. But if you're streetsmart you shouldn't have any troubles. One good thing is that there's very little violence, not that many 'getting robbed and beaten in a back alley' incidents, worst case you lose your stuff. It's perfectly fine to prevent people from coming to close to you(in the tourist areas), although not in an unfriendly way.

Spanish: Use the little Spanish you know even if your Spanish is horrible. If the person you talk to knows English they will probably switch, but the effort makes people more friendly towards you(just as in any country). If you don't find anyone who knows English well enough try the small shops run by immigrants, they often speak better English than native Spanish people.

Being American: Some people in Europe dislike Americans but they're just the same narrow-minded people that you find anywhere so you don't want to hang out with them anyways. Go ahead and be American.

Catalan/Spain: As an outsider you may occasionally be corrected by Catalan people but it's a myth that Catalan people expects foreigners to know everything about Spain/Catalan(in general of course, see 'Being American') or that they would be offended by you talking in Spanish.

Do: Besides drinking, eating and doing the obligatory Gaudi-sightseeings(which you should do, really) there's not much to do in Barcelona. This is not necessarily a bad thing but don't expect Barcelona to be a melting-pot for new culture and new experiences, it's pretty much mainstream here. I would suggest walking around, stopping at bars for a coffe/beer/snack and keep on walking. The architecture is nice in certain areas.

Food: This is a tricky one. There is really nice food in Barcelona but I would say that the standard restaurant or pub food is below average. Since you traveled you probably know the drill of finding ok food, follow the locals. But in doubt a doner kebab is your best bet, not tapas.

Tourist areas: Is mainly concentrated between Catalunya and the sea. You should however walk around there a bit because it is nice, it's just that it's very touristy, with all that brings, so it can get annoying. There is an area in the center called El Raval which is, according to me, the nicest center area.

Going out: Go anywhere. The late open clubs around(not on) La Rambla is ok, but nothing special, a bar is probably better for you than a club.

Light Drugs: You can buy drugs on the streets but I wouldn't recommend it. If you just want to smoke some weed because you're on holiday ask someone that you're meeting in a bar instead, the chance that they smoke and that they will give you some or fix it for you is pretty big.

THE MOST IMPORTANT THING: Barca is the football team, Milan is also accepted.

First of all this is a massive deal. It's not a ""just"". For people like me, the fact that we did not progress more to the left (which is how we view all progress) is a big deal.  The fact that in order to manage public corporations better, we did not institute worker's councils or some other form of democratic control, but we gave it to the rich is a massive deal. 


Corporate taxations is lower than it is for real humans. Corporate subsidies are insane again (in almost every industry). Labour rights and unions are down the drain (your labour rights in the south of Europe are gone completely by now).  Healthcare in my home country (Greece) is effectively private now. 

Work hours have been going up. etc

Banker bailouts adds to that as well - as we speak we keep on printing money for the banks. Reverse marxism is when you bail out the bank, not the ones that own loans. 

It's very real, we are getting more and more pro-market reforms every day, fewer worker right, more worker hours etc. Yes, the world is not a living hell as it was for the worker of the 1900s (and that's why there are no armed rebellions - yet, but its getting progressively worse  2000 years back we even had slavery.

Either way, the rate of [defections](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Army) to the Japanese, the fact that all officers were British as well as the subsequent move to independence suggest that the loyalty of Indian volunteers was uncertain.

There is no best empire or even a good empire. Suggesting that the British Empire could be called that is somewhat dismissive of the number of people whose lives were crushed to make room for it. Its’ heritage consists of Boer concentration camps and scorched earth, the Irish Potato Famine, the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, and many more similar events in America, Africa, Asia, and Australia done to control/punish natives or out of indiference to their lives, a heritage which manages to live on to this day thanks to poorly thought out map making.The people who most benefited from it’s existance were those few and powerful in its’ metropole.

The past is a foreign land and there is no use in keeping descendants to account for the actions of their ancestors. On the other hand glorifying empires is a bit daft. Former subjects rarely miss them when they are gone.

Note: There is a lot of nuance and I admit a lot of things that have benefited humanity came from the UK during that time, but its’ foreign policy was not one of them.

Generally speaking I would very much agree with that.

Perhaps the people of Zimbabwe are an exception.

And Ghana became independent in 1956 with $481 million in foreign reserves that were all gone ten years later gratis Nkrumah.

And Kenyatta's legacy in Kenya has been good for his cronies but no one else.

And Tanzania's Nyerere admitted in his 1985 farewell speech,  ""I failed. Let's admit it."" 

Obviously, I could go on ...

And despite that, the departure of the British is not missed, which is fine and good.

But it does speak of a nuance out there.
