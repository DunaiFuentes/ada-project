That totally depends on how the person reacts to it. If it has (temporary) consequences for the health of the assaulted person, then it is verbal assault.

It's like physical assault just the line is a big higher.

- making Scotland become the UK: for the other States to accept this as valid, this would probably entail moving the UK capital to Edinburgh. Possibly also creating an English Parliament and maybe even dissolving the Scottish one.
- England+Wales+NI becoming independent from Scotland
- E+W+NI leaving the EU - Wales and NI might want to have a separate vote from that of England - I honestly don't know how strong is Euroscepticism there. Republicanism might make things go ugly in NI.

That's absurdly complicated.

Ils partagent une utopie : une monnaie mondiale adossée à une denrée réelle. Ils s'accordent sur le fait que ça a peu de chances d'arriver aujourd'hui. 

Ils partagent l'idée qu'une entité Européenne prêteuse aux États est essentielle et plus réaliste. Mélenchon prône une création de monnaie à ce niveau et un rééchelonnement de la dette due aux prêteurs privés. Attali propose une émission de bons du trésor Européens. 

Attali pense qu'il faut diminuer les dépenses de l'état mais ne prône pas un retour à l'équilibre. Il souhaite que l'état puisse emprunter pour ses investissements mais pas pour son fonctionnement. Il partage avec Mélenchon l'opinion que aujourd'hui, on n'a rien pour faire la différence et qu'il faut vraiment la faire. Pour Mélenchon, beaucoup des mesures d'économie dont Attali préconise la suppression sont en fait des mesures d'investissement. C'est leur plus gros désaccord.

Ils sont d'accord également pour dire que les entreprises, surtout les grands groupes s'optimisant fiscalement, ne sont pas assez taxés.

I don't even think any state would have to specifically demand that. I am no expert in EU law, but it seems the UK and Denmark have explicit opt-outs in the Maastricht Treaty. Given that the UK's opt-out would **not** automatically extend to Scotland, then it follows that it would be subject to the same rules as the other new member States. No-one has to ask for it; the rule is already there.

As for Schengen, I think it would be slightly more plausible for Scotland to get a formal opt-out, because, as you have pointed out, it is an issue which relates to territory and borders; these are the kinds of things a newly state usually carries on from its previous state.

&gt;Then again, I'm speculating, but without information that's all I can do. Scotland has to decide if it wants to be its own country based largely on speculations, and that's terrible.

I disagree. Scotland doesn't have to decide based on speculations. Scotland might speculate as much as it wants that its EU membership would be automatic; this is wrong. Period. Anyone with a basic command of the law of treaties can explain that to the Scottish (and Catalan) politicians.

- men + women: hug/kiss/hug+kiss/kissing hand is the most traditional and means a high respect to a woman, when it's a close friend or collegue you kiss once on a cheek and/or hug, older people kiss three times; 
- women + women: one to three kisses, hug
- men + men: handshake, if a close friend hug, older people also kiss (only three times, no more, no less)
- How many kisses?: nowadays usually one, two - sometimes but it's not very popular nor is traditional, rather by mistake, three - the most traditional, when kissing man-man **three kisses** no less, no more
- Cheek, mouth, air, hand?: cheek, hand
- After how much time of not seeing each other?: after a day, when it's someone we didn't see for a long time or won't see for a long time hugging and kissing seems more appropriate, if you see someone on a daily basis you won't kiss that person three times on cheeks, one time is then appropriate, you also won't hug a guy (if you're a guy) if you'll see in few days - if he's going away, just got from some far away place, then hugging and even kissing is appropriate",0,1355216293,null,0,false,0,c7eqn74,t3_14n15a,t1_c7eqn74,t3_14n15a,null,1430641287,9,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,9

Strangers: Handshake

Relatives: M/M: handshake, maybe hug for close relatives (e.g. father/son), M/F and F/F: hug and/or kiss on cheek.  My mother-in-law insists on kissing me on the lips (no tongues though ;-), but that's a bit too intimate in my opinion (my own mother doesn't).

Friends: M/M: handshake, M/F and F/F: one (sometimes two) cheek kisses.  Cheek kissing tends to be more prevalent in the South and among the middle/upper classes.  In the North and among lower/working class people I've found it to be less common.  If memory serves, it became popular in the 70s and 80s as cheap package holidays became available and more people started travelling abroad.  I can remember being a child in the 1980s when kissing on the cheek was considered a very French thing to do.  I suspect that there was a lot of social climbing going on initially - kissing someone on the cheek was a way of saying ""look at me, I can afford to go abroad for my holidays and now I'm all continental"".  But I digress... 

Business: handshake

Usually the kiss/embrace/shake would happen on meeting and then again on departure.  If you saw them again later that day you might skip it.  But the next day, you would do it again.

This generally doesn't apply for people you see everyday.  For example, it would be considered a bit strange if your work colleagues  greeted you with a handshake every day.",0,1355218275,null,0,false,0,c7eqvz4,t3_14n15a,t1_c7eqvz4,t3_14n15a,null,1430641398,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

true,MauvaisConseil,YAFrance,France,"^(Attali est passé dans la plupart des émissions audiovisuelles pour présenter son dernier livre. En répétant sur tous les tons qu'il y a urgence à régler le problème de la dette en France. Mais nos montages ne satisfont pas notre invité, qui rappelle que son ""livre de 250 pages"" vise à rappeler l'histoire de la dette en Europe, et à ""dire ce qu'il convient de faire"", très vite. Pourquoi très vite ? Mélenchon souligne un point intéressant de son livre : la France devra payer 59 milliards à ses créanciers en juillet, puis au mois de septembre. Et il faut trouver l'argent, c'est-à-dire… le ré-emprunter.
Mélenchon tente d'aborder la crise avec une vision marxiste, pour démontrer que certaines thèses de Marx ou de ses disciples sont validées aujourd'hui. Daniel essaye de le faire avancer plus vite... et se trouve pris en plein dans la fureur mélenchonienne ! L'orage passé, le politique délivre sa préconisation (déjà esquissée sur notre plateau il y a peu) ^(: si les banques prennent la France à la gorge, il suffit ""d'étrangler les étrangleurs"", c'est à dire de décider qu'on ne remboursera qu'une partie de la dette ! Le ""défaut"", ou (version soft)^) ^(le ""moratoire"" , voilà la solution… Attali n'est ""pas d'accord"" avec cette idée, mais reconnaît qu'elle a été appliquée de nombreuses fois dans l'histoire. Une des meilleures solutions de long terme, à ses yeux, serait que l'Union européenne puisse emprunter en son nom, et non plus chaque pays européen dans son coin. Un peu paradoxal, remarque Anne-Sophie : si les pays européens sont trop endettés, pourquoi l'Europe déciderait-elle de s'endetter en son nom propre ? ""La manœuvre est complexe"", reconnaît Attali.
Il préconise aussi la création d'une monnaie commune… mondiale. D'ailleurs, il pense ""qu'il faut viser le gouvernement mondial"". Et se demande simplement si ce gouvernement mondial se fera ""à la place de la guerre, ou après la guerre"". ""Vous avez entendu ce qu'il vient de dire, là ?"" demande Mélenchon, comme tétanisé. C'est l'occasion pour Daniel de demander à Attali, qui a vu se construire la monnaie unique, si ""le couple franco-allemand"" tant vanté n'est pas qu'une façon polie de désigner un système dans lequel les Allemands dictent leurs conditions à leurs partenaires.
Nos deux invités se penchent ensuite sur la banque centrale européenne (BCE)^) ^(. Pour Mélenchon, il est urgent de ""sortir la dette des Etats du marché"" : aujourd'hui, pour combler leur déficit, les Etats transforment leurs dettes en titres financiers, achetés par investisseurs et spéculateurs de tout poil. Mélenchon souhaite que les Etats puissent emprunter directement à la BCE, aux taux très intéressants où elle prête aux banques privées. Mais aujourd'hui, la BCE a une seule mission : surveiller et contenir l'inflation. ""La question mérite d'être sérieusement débattue"", convient Attali, qui explique que cette option est pourtant mal considérée par certains économistes, qui estiment qu'elle ouvre la voie, justement, à l'inflation. S'ensuit un cours d'économie politique sur l'effet, théorique et réel, de l'inflation sur le ""stock de la dette"". Retour au concret avec Mélenchon, qui prend un certain plaisir à rappeler que dans le cas d'un prêt à un Etat ""celui qui est le plus en danger, c'est celui qui a prêté l'argent""…
Mélenchon examine ensuite ""le sort de ces malheureux prêteurs"". ""Ce n'est pas vous, ce n'est pas moi, c'est des gens qui brassent des milliards"". Attali objecte que ""40 % de la dette française est prêtée par des Français"", notamment par les banques, qui utilisent en partie l'argent des épargnants. Et si l'Etat décide de ne plus rembourser, les banques qui lui ont prêté ont de bonnes chances de faire faillite, et les épargnants seront touchés… Une remarque efficace, que Mélenchon évacue rapidement, pour se concentrer sur sa proposition de créer un système bancaire nationalisé. Pourquoi ? ""Parce que ces gens-là ne fonctionnent que pour eux"", tout simplement. Tout cela à l'échelon européen ? Attali est pour. A l'échelon national, il est moins convaincu.
Et maintenant, quelles solutions ? Attali indique que ""dans une hypothèse optimiste"", la France a besoin de trouver 50 milliards d'euros rapidement, dans les deux prochaines années. Mais comment ? Là, l'essayiste qui avait démarré l'émission en assurant que son livre apportait des solutions, semble tout à coup moins assuré : ""J'en saurai plus dans quelque temps, dans moins d'un mois : nous sommes en train d'y travailler au sein de la commission."" Quelques pistes néanmoins : suppression du département, réduction du nombre d'offices HLM, réduction du nombre de fonctionnaires dans les collectivités locales… Mais il reste flou, et estime, après hésitations, ""qu'on devrait pouvoir trouver 20 milliards d'euros par an"". Il estime que dans l'hypothèse optimiste où la croissance des prochaines années ""est à 2,5 %, on pourra faire sans augmentation d'impôts, et en réduisant les niches fiscales"". Sinon… Bien sûr, Mélenchon n'est pas d'accord avec cette ""logique comptable"" : ""Lui, il dit qu'il y a trop de dépenses, moi je dis qu'il n'y a pas assez de recettes !"" Et pour finir, il développe quelques-unes de ses idées pour récupérer plus d'impôts).",0,1355222079,null,0,false,0,c7er5fi,t3_14movo,t1_c7er5fi,t1_c7eit6c,null,1430641521,1,false,france,t5_2qhjz,1

What does 'native' mean? You could say there are no native Europeans and we're all immigrants from Africa. It's only a matter of time scale. 

The point is that the German minority gets certain privileges in Poland, like being able to elect their representatives to parliament without meeting the minimum threshold but also many other, that are not reciprocated. Actually, why a proposal to treat all citizens the same, regardless of their ethnicity, would even rise an eyebrow?

true,will_holmes,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt;I don't even think any state would have to specifically demand that. I am no expert in EU law, but it seems the UK and Denmark have explicit opt-outs in the Maastricht Treaty. Given that the UK's opt-out would not automatically extend to Scotland, then it follows that it would be subject to the same rules as the other new member States. No-one has to ask for it; the rule is already there.

That's correct.

I suppose what I'm getting at is that an independent Scotland may not end up as independent as the SNP hopes it to be. Adopting these membership requirements largely represents a political transition into the core of the EU, where it was previously at the outskirts when it was in the UK.

Bear in mind, I'm not trying to imply doing these things are necessarily bad for Scotland, just that there are likely consequences that many nationalists have not considered. In Europe, being ""independent"" is quite a difficult prospect.

&gt;I disagree. Scotland doesn't have to decide based on speculations. Scotland might speculate as much as it wants that its EU membership would be automatic; this is wrong. Period. Anyone with a basic command of the law of treaties can explain that to the Scottish (and Catalan) politicians.
Furthermore, I think such clarifications as Mr Barroso has provided will be forthcoming as the Scottish referendum nears and other secessionist movements arise, especially if politicians around Europe continue to be as successful as they have been in prolonging the economic crisis.

Barroso has cleared up one question, which I'm grateful for. However, the speculation lies in how a reapplication for EU membership will turn out. Hopefully it will all be cleared up before the referendum, but somehow I doubt it. The SNP is still saying that Barroso is wrong, after all, and getting a lawyer to root through EU law to come to a legally sound conclusion may take a very long time.",0,1355224524,null,0,1355224790,0,c7erd5o,t3_14lsd2,t1_c7erd5o,t1_c7en7eb,null,1430641623,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Das steht ihr als Privatunternehmen zunächst einmal frei, aber als Bahnkunde stellt man sich doch die Frage ob das wirklich so sein muss, oder ob man mit einem Anbieter einen Deal aushandeln könnte, der freies WLAN in Zügen ermöglicht.

Am Ende ist aber schon klar, wieso es nicht passieren wird: Freies WLAN wird nicht sehr viele Neukunden anlocken, also sind das nur Kosten. Deshalb nimmt man sich einen Partner ins Boot, der groß genug ist damit man ihm einfach nur Bauraum und Strom im Zug gibt, und der soll dann einfach WLAN machen so wie er es für richtig hält, fertig. Die Telekom wiederum hat nichts zu verschenken und tut das, was Monopolisten (das sind sie beim WLAN praktisch, weil UMTS häufig nicht geht) eben so tun.

**business partners**: Normally handshake, but for coworkers sometimes the same rules as relatives apply.

**men + women**: 1 kiss on the cheek, but 3 at birthdays.

**women + women**: 1 kiss on the cheek, but 3 at birthdays

**men + men**: no kiss, but I have no knowledge of LGBT customs.

**How many?**: 1 for greeting, 3 for birthdays.

**Cheek, mouth, air, hand?**: Cheek and air (mouth for BF/GF only)

**After long time no see**: same rules apply as friends

**Alternatives**: Handshakes like [this](http://www.csmonitor.com/var/ezflow_site/storage/images/media/images/2010/0104/0104-handshake-newscom/7173702-3-eng-US/0104-handshake-newscom_full_600.jpg) and [this](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_W8k_-zfUyVg/SW4mMkGnIrI/AAAAAAAABEk/FltUrPZ6Lf0/s320/handshake%201.jpg), (awkward) waving hand, (awkward) slightly raising of hand, eyecontact and nodding head, saying hello, saying hello then awkwardly waiting to see if the other person expects a kiss/shake.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Attali est passé dans la plupart des émissions audiovisuelles pour présenter son dernier livre. En répétant sur tous les tons qu'il y a urgence à régler le problème de la dette en France. Mais nos montages ne satisfont pas notre invité, qui rappelle que son ""livre de 250 pages"" vise à rappeler l'histoire de la dette en Europe, et à ""dire ce qu'il convient de faire"", très vite. Pourquoi très vite ? Mélenchon souligne un point intéressant de son livre : la France devra payer 59 milliards à ses créanciers en juillet, puis au mois de septembre. Et il faut trouver l'argent, c'est-à-dire… le ré-emprunter.

Mélenchon tente d'aborder la crise avec une vision marxiste, pour démontrer que certaines thèses de Marx ou de ses disciples sont validées aujourd'hui. Daniel essaye de le faire avancer plus vite... et se trouve pris en plein dans la fureur mélenchonienne ! L'orage passé, le politique délivre sa préconisation (déjà esquissée sur notre plateau il y a peu) : si les banques prennent la France à la gorge, il suffit ""d'étrangler les étrangleurs"", c'est à dire de décider qu'on ne remboursera qu'une partie de la dette ! Le ""défaut"", ou (version soft) le ""moratoire"" , voilà la solution… Attali n'est ""pas d'accord"" avec cette idée, mais reconnaît qu'elle a été appliquée de nombreuses fois dans l'histoire. Une des meilleures solutions de long terme, à ses yeux, serait que l'Union européenne puisse emprunter en son nom, et non plus chaque pays européen dans son coin. Un peu paradoxal, remarque Anne-Sophie : si les pays européens sont trop endettés, pourquoi l'Europe déciderait-elle de s'endetter en son nom propre ? ""La manœuvre est complexe"", reconnaît Attali.

Il préconise aussi la création d'une monnaie commune… mondiale. D'ailleurs, il pense ""qu'il faut viser le gouvernement mondial"". Et se demande simplement si ce gouvernement mondial se fera ""à la place de la guerre, ou après la guerre"". ""Vous avez entendu ce qu'il vient de dire, là ?"" demande Mélenchon, comme tétanisé. C'est l'occasion pour Daniel de demander à Attali, qui a vu se construire la monnaie unique, si ""le couple franco-allemand"" tant vanté n'est pas qu'une façon polie de désigner un système dans lequel les Allemands dictent leurs conditions à leurs partenaires

Nos deux invités se penchent ensuite sur la banque centrale européenne (BCE). Pour Mélenchon, il est urgent de ""sortir la dette des Etats du marché"" : aujourd'hui, pour combler leur déficit, les Etats transforment leurs dettes en titres financiers, achetés par investisseurs et spéculateurs de tout poil. Mélenchon souhaite que les Etats puissent emprunter directement à la BCE, aux taux très intéressants où elle prête aux banques privées. Mais aujourd'hui, la BCE a une seule mission : surveiller et contenir l'inflation. ""La question mérite d'être sérieusement débattue"", convient Attali, qui explique que cette option est pourtant mal considérée par certains économistes, qui estiment qu'elle ouvre la voie, justement, à l'inflation. S'ensuit un cours d'économie politique sur l'effet, théorique et réel, de l'inflation sur le ""stock de la dette"". Retour au concret avec Mélenchon, qui prend un certain plaisir à rappeler que dans le cas d'un prêt à un Etat ""celui qui est le plus en danger, c'est celui qui a prêté l'argent""

Mélenchon examine ensuite ""le sort de ces malheureux prêteurs"". ""Ce n'est pas vous, ce n'est pas moi, c'est des gens qui brassent des milliards"". Attali objecte que ""40 % de la dette française est prêtée par des Français"", notamment par les banques, qui utilisent en partie l'argent des épargnants. Et si l'Etat décide de ne plus rembourser, les banques qui lui ont prêté ont de bonnes chances de faire faillite, et les épargnants seront touchés… Une remarque efficace, que Mélenchon évacue rapidement, pour se concentrer sur sa proposition de créer un système bancaire nationalisé. Pourquoi ? ""Parce que ces gens-là ne fonctionnent que pour eux"", tout simplement. Tout cela à l'échelon européen ? Attali est pour. A l'échelon national, il est moins convaincu

Et maintenant, quelles solutions ? Attali indique que ""dans une hypothèse optimiste"", la France a besoin de trouver 50 milliards d'euros rapidement, dans les deux prochaines années. Mais comment ? Là, l'essayiste qui avait démarré l'émission en assurant que son livre apportait des solutions, semble tout à coup moins assuré : ""J'en saurai plus dans quelque temps, dans moins d'un mois : nous sommes en train d'y travailler au sein de la commission."" Quelques pistes néanmoins : suppression du département, réduction du nombre d'offices HLM, réduction du nombre de fonctionnaires dans les collectivités locales… Mais il reste flou, et estime, après hésitations, ""qu'on devrait pouvoir trouver 20 milliards d'euros par an"". Il estime que dans l'hypothèse optimiste où la croissance des prochaines années ""est à 2,5 %, on pourra faire sans augmentation d'impôts, et en réduisant les niches fiscales"". Sinon… Bien sûr, Mélenchon n'est pas d'accord avec cette ""logique comptable"" : ""Lui, il dit qu'il y a trop de dépenses, moi je dis qu'il n'y a pas assez de recettes !""

Lots of people like this definition because it's a nice, simple and objective defintion and it means black people in the UK can be racist to white people, or that affirmative action is racist. I think this is the definition you're using.

There's another definition, which is that racist actions are actions that's designed to maintain &amp; reinforce the institutionalised power structure among races. Right now, if modern UK life was a video game, ""white male"" would be an easier difficulty level than ""black male"". There are statistically less problems for the ""white male"" group. Racist actions is talk that re-enforced that imbalance, and attempts to undo the power imbalance is not racist. This definition is harder for some people to accept because it means that you need to look at yourself and think about what power imbalances you might be benefiting from, and it means that affirmative action is not racist, and attempts to stop is could be construed as racist (since stopping affirmative action can re-enforce power imbalances).

Two of the last three British Prime Ministers have been Scottish.

Scotland has it's own parliament.

Scotland has its own judicial system.

It has its own education system where Scottish students don't pay tuition fees at university, whereas English students pay for tuition at Scottish universities.

Scotland has its own health system, where Scots don't pay prescription charges but people in England do.

Scotland controls Scottish agriculture.

Scottish members of Parliament at Westminster can vote on purely English matters but English ones can't on Scottish issues.   This is the West Lothian question.

The British government spends more money per capita on the Scots than it does on the English, thanks to the Barnett Formula.

When the oil price is at its peak, which is occasional, Scotland ""maybe"" contributes more to the UK than it gets back.

When oil is not at its peak, which is usual, Scotland gets a lot more out of the Uk than it puts in.

Scots have full and open access to British capital resources, intellectual networks and sporting facilities. 

Scotland should become independent for all of these reasons, not just its misplaced persecution complex and possibly well founded chippiness.

And lifestyle-wise, living in San Diego couldn't be farther apart from living in Essen. You'd have to adjust to an entirely different climate (by your SoCal standards, it's freezing from Mid-October to Mid-March). There is no beach or glamour culture. Not many ""fancy"" restaurants or bars, although there are really good ones in the Ruhr Area as well. People are inside most of the time, as opposed to SoCal. I know this may sound silly or obvious to you but you'd be surprised at the amount of people who deal with some sort of ""culture shock"" as an expat (which, of course, holds truth for almost all countries, not just Germany) because they were subject to some bias towards the idea that living abroad would not be very different from living in their own country. What I always suggest to people is to go to Google Street View and check out the city in order to get a general feeling. Street View's available for the Ruhr Area and many larger German cities.

1. Woman+woman
    * Strangers
        * Usually **two cheek-air kisses** (and by ""cheek-air"" I mean there's cheek contact, so not really ""air kiss"" like some snobs do).
        * Not so usually, **two cheek kisses** (you somehow knew this woman beforehand).
    * Relatives
        * Elders (grandma, mom), kids, and some close relatives (cousins, aunt) may get **one single, warm, direct cheek kiss**.
        * Rest of adult relatives will usually get **two cheek kisses**.
        * **Optional hug** if it's been a while since you last met.
    * Friends
        * **Two cheek or cheek-air kisses** the first time you meet each other (same day)
        * Hugs, high fives, hip bumping, whatever. You're friends.
    * Business partners
        * In a formal meeting, it depends on the type of relationship and character of the partners:
            * If the one that has the money (either she's your boss or she's your client) keeps the distance, then it's a **handshake**.
            * If she initiates the kissing, then **two air or cheek-air kisses**. This is more normal between women.
            * If you're equal partners, **two air or cheek-air kisses** are ok.
        * In your daily job, a simple ""good morning"" when you arrive is enough.

2. Woman+man
    * Strangers
        * Same rules as woman+woman.
        * If you *really* are strangers and don't feel like kissing, a **handshake** may be ok.
    * Relatives
        * Same rules as woman+woman, but including male relatives (grandpa, dad, godfather, uncle).
    * Friends
        * Same rules as woman+woman.
    * Business partners
        * In a formal meeting, the rules are somewhat similar to woman+woman, BUT if the woman initiates the **cheek kissing**, the man will usually follow since refusing could be seen as too rude. Anyways, most women will just go for a **handshake** as it is more professional.
        * In your daily job, a simple ""good morning"" when you arrive is enough.

3. Man+man
    * Strangers
        * ALWAYS **handshake**.
    * Relatives
        * Elders (grandpa, dad, godfather) and kids may get **one single, warm, direct cheek kiss**. On special days (Christmas, etc.) brothers may get one too.
        * Some VERY close relatives (uncle, cousin) may get **two cheek kisses**.
        * Rest of adult relatives will usually get a **hug** or a **handshake**.
    * Friends
        * **Handshaking** the first time you meet each other (same day).
        * Hugs, high fives, hip bumping, whatever. You're friends. 
    * Business partners
        * In a formal meeting, ALWAYS **handshake**.
        * In your daily job, a simple ""good morning"" when you arrive is enough.

  
  
  
About **mouth kissing**:  
This is almost always reserved for your significant other (gay or not). However:

 * Some (grand)parents are used to kiss their (grand)children in the lips, so you might see relatives doing it, but it's not usual and they tend to avoid this once all family members are adults (it's rather weird if they don't).  
 * Some girls kiss each other in the lips if they are close friends and/or in a party mood and/or want to tease the boys.

The first is bad news for the economy and the second could be disastrous for democracy, say German commentators.""                     
Lower taxes means increased consumption for the Romanian economy. In the past couple of years, the main issue of the Romanian economy has been decreased consumption. We don't have a debt issue, we are one of the EU countries with the lowest Debt to GDP ratios and our banking sector can be considered reasonably safe. Our issues are lack of competitiveness and decreasing consumption. The former government formed by PDL (conservative) imposed higher taxes and a compulsory tax on all companies as a solution to the decreasing budgetary revenues due to the global economic slowdown, but as history has proven, it was not a good solution since a lot of companies went bankrupt and consumption further decreased, impacting the already dwindling budgetary revenues even further, which resulted in even tougher austerity measures being implemented (government worker salaries cut, pensions frozen and taxed, etc..).            
From what I've noticed, some of the German press seem to be supporters of austerity as a solution to the issues some of the EU economies have, and to some extent more partial to conservative parties, which can explain the wave of negative articles after the Social-Liberal Union formed the government and more recently, won the Parliamentary elections.

You're talking about ""overnight"", something that rarely every happens. You can't ignore the non-rare things

&gt; Think of European immigrants to the US. While a tiny percentage might have reached the middle class in a few years, the vast majority took an entire generation to reach US ""middle-class"".

Why are you only looking at European immigrants? What about African 'immigrants' to the USA? It's factually incorrect to say ""the vast majority of them became middle class after first arriving in USA"".

What about the common cases?

&gt; By your argument, white immigrants to the UK from eastern Europe should be deprived of aid because they're the wrong color.

There seems to be common idea that ""racism"" is only between ""white"" and ""black"" (or ""asian"" etc.). There seems to be an idea that all ""white"" people are the same race. This is not what (any) law about racism says. Just about all law on racism *includes* ""ethnicity"" (Can you find a law (anywhere) that includes ""race"" but not ""ethnicity""? I can't) This means a Polish immigrant to the UK (say) does legally count as a separate race/ethnicity to (say) a traditional white english person.

&gt; It's either aid for all, including white immigrants and indigenous poor people or no aid for anyone.

No, it doesn't have to be that. We spend money on immigrants, and we spend money on people who are sick. We spend money on people who are sick when they are children and we spend money giving to the arts, we spend money on giving students grants to university.

true,Fairwolf,SCOT,Scotland,"&gt;Two of the last three British Prime Ministers have been Scottish.

As much as the point I'm going to make reeks of 'No True Scotsman', I think it's valid. Tony Blair was about as Scottish as David Cameron. He may have been born in Scotland, but his interests did not align there. His interests, as with most Westminster politicians, aligned with himself and the South-East of England.

Don't even get me started on Brown, exact same problem. Couple that with the fact that he once referred to himself as 'Northern English'. Most people in Scotland don't consider being Scottish an ethnicity thing, they consider it cultural, we'll happily welcome anyone who blends in with the culture, no matter where they're from, conversely, we'll take great pains to decry people who shun it, ala Brown and Blair. 

&gt;Scotland has it's own parliament.

So we do. What's your point?

&gt;Scotland has its own judicial system.

Have done since the Middle Ages really. 

&gt;It has its own education system where Scottish students don't pay tuition fees at university, whereas English students pay for tuition at Scottish universities.

Don't get all soppy over that. It's your own Government's fault for that. Scotland doesn't just magically steal money at English expense to fund the Universities, they sacrificed in other areas to be able to afford free tuition fees, paid for by the Scottish taxpayer. English students don't pay tax in Scotland, so why should they get the education paid for by tax payers up here? The EU students only get it because of a legal loophole. 

&gt;Scotland has its own health system, where Scots don't pay prescription charges but people in England do. 

Again, exact same issue. Westminster voted that way, for whatever peculiar reason. I might also add, you should be questioning certain MPs who voted for free prescription charges in Wales, but voted against them in Westminster. Such as: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGxRcVFpNOQ#t=4m06s

&gt;Scotland controls Scottish agriculture.#

So we do.

&gt;Scottish members of Parliament at Westminster can vote on purely English matters but English ones can't on Scottish issues. This is the West Lothian question.

The West Lothian question isn't supported in Scotland either, England should have it's own parliament, separate from Westminster. I should also note that it's SNP policy to abstain from voting on issues that don't affect Scotland in Westminster.

&gt;The British government spends more money per capita on the Scots than it does on the English, thanks to the Barnett Formula.

Scotland also contributes more than it receives to the UK Treasury, so I hardly think it's an issue worth bringing up, unless you wish to remove the Barnett Formula and leave us with our own resources?

Which I think would be a rather nice idea. 

&gt;When the oil price is at its peak, which is occasional, Scotland ""maybe"" contributes more to the UK than it gets back.

There are no 'Maybes'. Scotland has contributed more than it's received for most of the time oil has been being extracted in the North Sea, that was what was indicated by Gavin McCrone in the McCrone report and it remains perfectly true to this day. 

&gt;When oil is not at its peak, which is usual, Scotland gets a lot more out of the Uk than it puts in.

Total bollocks.

&gt;Scots have full and open access to British capital resources, intellectual networks and sporting facilities.

What, are you suggesting those were contributed entirely for by English taxpayers, and that the Scots just hang on like parasites?

I got news for you, we paid for those as well with our own taxes. Those facilities weren't a single commitment by one country.

&gt;Scotland should become independent for all of these reasons, not just its misplaced persecution complex and possibly well founded chippiness.

No, we should become Independent because the people vote for it, if they don't, then oh well. ",0,1355238487,null,0,false,0,c7etdew,t3_14nnpb,t1_c7etdew,t1_c7esk1f,null,1430642569,14,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,14

But I also think it should be acknowledged that the German minority in Silesia is a special case. Silesia has always been German, until the west-transition of Poland after the second World War. Suddenly, German villages found themselves living in Poland. 

The Russians forbid, under the threat of heavy punishment, to speak the German language. The German minority was basically illegal and if you wanted to survive in Poland during the aftermath of WW2, you'd better not mention that you speak German. 

This really changed only after after the fall of the Sowjet union. 

So, what we have here is a native community that was suppressed for many years, which now seems to have some social rights. (I don't know them, but I guess it is about the usual representation in local Government.)

Taken to the logical extreme you would be in favour of a single world super government then?  Why not just have one MP/leader to represent everyone as one glorious whole?  Surely by having several MP's representing different communities and interests we are fragmenting the human race?  Just because some people want political representation doesn't mean they do so because of some childish football team-esque tribal nature.  

Let's engage in an absurd gedanken just to highlight this.  Imagine Palestine was represented politically and economically by Israel.  The palestinian people didn't have a seat on the UN because Israel already had one etc.  

It's easy to see the problem here because the contrast between the two cultures is so extreme despite being so geographically close.  There is a reason the two state solution is the only viable option for peace here.  Israel simply can't politically represent the people of Palestine.

true,Riddle_me_sith,null,null,"I disagree with you that parents shouldn't teach their kids their native language as the first language in all cases. It is absolutely possible for parents to *only* interact with their kids in their own language, and yet allow for the children to develop a firm grasp of the second language. This being mainly based on myself and all other immigrant children I know. And I know a looooooooot of immigrant children from different backgrounds.

My parents *insisted* that we only speak Russian at home because we were quite young when we moved and they were afraid of us forgetting it. They were told, quite rightly it turns out, that we would very quickly learn English and it is Russian that will be hard to remember. And it turned out to be right, English is now my and my brother's best language, but we are also fluent in Russian because we kept up with it. 

Kids are like sponges, they'll very quickly learn multiple languages around them, **if taught properly**. I've known a 4 year old that spoke 3 languages fluently. The mother was Russian, the father was French, and the kid went to a German kindergarten. 

I think the reason why some kids fail to learn the second language is probably based on the fact that they end up living in places with a high concentration of people from their country of origin, so they end up interacting mostly in their native tongue. *Then* you got a problem, cause you never have the opportunity to develop the 2nd language properly. Which is why I think it's so goddamn important for the government to make sure enclaves of immigrants don't form, they should be more spread out for better integration. 

In that case, I definitively (bloody hell, been speaking English for 17 years now, still can't spell that word on the first go) agree with you. It becomes the burden of the parents to make sure their kid does learn the language of the new country. That could mean either making an effort of speaking it at home, or relocating to a school were there are more international people, so they'll be forced to find another common language. Unfortunately it seems a lot of parents don't fucking bother (or can't, due to bad circumstances/ not knowing the language themselves).

But in general, so long as the child grows up with other children that for the most part do not speak their first language, there is no need for the parents to especially teach their kids that language at home as well.  They'll soon absorb it themselves.

TL;DR Parents can so teach their native tongue as the first language, so long as the child has plenty of opportunity to interact with other children/ adults in the 2nd language. ",0,1355245170,null,0,false,0,c7ev4ou,t3_14nqrv,t1_c7ev4ou,t1_c7etrcw,null,1430643396,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

————————————————————————

De jure incentives to take common position: This incentive is reinforced by the way the
Commission’s ECB/EBA Regulations are currently drafted. For example:

• The ECB Regulation envisions the ECB acting as a coordinator of eurozone national
supervisors, with the view for them to take a common position. The ECB has already
dropped hints that it intends to actively discourage dissenting opinions amongst
eurozone national supervisors.

• Through a eurozone caucus, some member states will indirectly boost their influence as
their voting weight amongst eurozone countries is proportionally much greater than in the
EU-27 (EU-28 with Croatia). This is particularly true of the larger eurozone member
states.

• The safeguards proposed by the European Commission (see Section 5 below) leave the
eurozone with the upper hand. Given that the 17 eurozone countries already constitute a
simple majority, these countries would only need to seek the support of three ‘outs’ –
whereas non-euro countries would need at least four countries.

De facto incentives to take a common euro position: To avoid banks free-riding on taxpayers
in creditor countries, the ECB, Germany and others could well insist on putting into place
perfectly harmonised eurozone regulations before moving to financial backstops. This could
include single-target capital requirements, rules on leverage or bonuses – and could even
spill over to market access issues. In turn, this would heavily shape decisions at the EBA, as
the eurozone is unlikely to accept an uneven playing field within EU financial services as a
whole.De facto incentives to take a common euro position: To avoid banks free-riding on taxpayers

the eurozone is unlikely to accept an uneven playing field within EU financial services as a

Taken together, the EBA structure will therefore significantly shift the balance of power in
favour of the eurozone, at the expense of the UK and other ‘outs’.

If you are of African and N. African origin, you hardly ever have a chance of being chosen. While if you are black from French oversees region, you are considered more pretty. For example, Miss Corsica is originally from the Reunion Islands which is a French oversees territory. Seeing a Black or Arab Miss Corsica would be VERY hard to imagine..So its not really *racism* per se, more like favoratism. Carribean and Indian Ocean blacks are ok, African ones not.

So this is my explanation of the events. How I determine it is that French oversees territory have had a different trajectory as they are often times represented for their islands (Tahiti, Guadeloupe, Reunion, Guyanne etc.) and have won a couple times, so we are now ""accustumed to them"". However, the entrance of French black women is newer so it can take a while before they enter the conscious as beautiful.

But I think they are making a big deal out of nothing. Miss France is a huge joke NOONE takes it seriously. Plus an African women has won before- http://s.plurielles.fr/mmdia/i/02/2/sonia-rolland-2818022fjxci.jpg?v=2 (half Rwandan/half French). 

Plus even if you are angry what do you do? Change the regional judges, force them to prefer black women? These things are highly subjective and you cant change years of bias just by protesting.

&gt; A new report from the U.S. National Intelligence Council claims the possible formation of Kurdistan may affect Turkey's unity in upcoming years.

The problem here is that this Kurdistan's borders would be extremely hard to draw. Some Kurds identify as such, some others don't. I'd say that about 40% of them at most would want to separate, and the average Kurdish guy would only want his language and culture to be recognized and not be seen as ""inferior"" to Turkish culture.

The current government is very sketchy and they are unlikely to allow anything like this, but they have passed laws allowing Kurdish TV and press. This should have been done long ago, but baby steps are steps too. The problem is that even if the laws say something, it's very hard to change people's mindsets. 

But back to the borders: It would look something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/g0BwX.gif). If somehow all the Kurds were transported to their homeland WW2 -style, that would cause a lot of problems. And by 2030, they might not want to leave anyway, because 

&gt;Turkey will also play an increasing role in the international arena and will have a wider influence in global affairs, the report said.

Now that might be true, but I have a feeling that either the politics stuff will have a huge change, or we'll have become Saudi Arabia. The guys running the place, AKP, have changed a lot in just 10 years. The education system is a total mess (not that it was ever decent.) It changes every 3 or so years. People don't even know how they'll be getting into universities. It changed 3? years ago, it will change in 2 years again probably. The 4+4+4 thing allows old men in the east to keep their children home and act like they're being homeschooled, and the new dress code basically allows anything, allowing headscarves in 6th grade. The military was cleansed head to toe, and while I'm sure some of them were actually guilty of plotting against the government, my mom attended a trial. The evidence against dozens of people has been proven completely fabricated (word 2007 document written in 2001? really?) and the judges are corrupt. This should have been gone, not made worse. I think I'm ranting.

&gt;The report suggested that European countries should keep the possibility of Turkey's accession going, as well as the negotiations.

Nope, we don't belong in there. Culturally completely incompatible for at least 30 more years. Besides, even ignoring the economical things I'll get to in a minute, the EU is obviously just going to be in an ""ever closer union"" and that won't work. We can hardly keep our own country together.

&gt;The report further stated that Turkey, among countries like Colombia, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Mexico and South Africa may witness an economic rise. Russia, Japan and Europe, however, may undergo an economic decline, according to the report.

Well, the AKP has definitely done a lot of good for the economy, and I think that's a major reason why they're being re-elected. I just think there's a bubble of some sort and it's about to burst. Someone on here said it's like Spain in the 90s, but I don't know. People are buying houses all over the place, but nobody lives in them. 

&gt;Further scenarios included a decline in the ""superpower"" status of the United States, with the country becoming “first among equals” in a new multi-polar world order.
China, however, is mentioned as a ""slowly rising"" global power that will ""remain a top-tier player in Asia.""
Meanwhile, Islamist terrorism may be over by 2030, the report read. 

..Maybe. But I disagree about the terrorism thing. 2030 is only 18 years away.

* Turkey continues to occupy the territory of another EU member state, Cyprus, and sends settlers from the mainland in order to alter the population balance between the two largest ethnic groups, Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots. This is one of the reasons that the Greek Cypriots rejected the last version of the Annan Plan for the ""reunification"" of the island.

* Kurds are said to be the largest nation without a state. While Turkey referred to Kurds as ""Mountain Turks"" in the past, an increasingly autonomous Iraqi Kurdistan would function as the first step towards an independent Kurdistan. Having that in mind, Turkey made some concessions to Kurds (such as using their language in media), hoping to contain the problem, but the unrest continues. The presence of Kurds in Syria adds another headache.

* Turkey is obliged to sign the [Law of the Sea treaty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Convention_on_the_Law_of_the_Sea#Signature_and_ratification), if it wants to join the EU. The treaty has entered into force, but Turkey finds itself in the minority of countries that refuse to sign it. The reason is that Turkey disputes Greece's, Cyprus', and by extension EU's rights in the Aegean Sea and in the Mediterranean. Cyprus discovered massive natural gas reserves recently, and many researchers believe that Greece has also the same potential.

* Turkey does not recognize the genocides of the Christian populations of the Ottoman Empire (Armenian, Assyrian, Pontic and Anatolian Greek), although [Mustafa Kemal, the founder of modern Turkey acknowledged at the time that some party ""left-overs"" had a plan for mass slaughters.](http://www.genocidetext.net/iags_resolution_supporting_documentation.htm) These genocides are recognized by the experts of the International Association of Genocide Scholars.

* Turkey has a young population. This has the potential of Turkey having the largest number of MEPs. With Turkey being a Muslim majority country in a (mainly) Christian union, this issue is a taboo.

* Germany, being the most populous country in the EU, doesn't really want Turkey to join the union, but can't say it outright because there are millions of Turkish immigrants in the country. A decade ago, Germany hid behind Greece's denial, given the bilateral issues in the Aegean and beyond. Greece finally realized this, and started supporting Turkey in exchange of admitting Cyprus in the union. Cyprus entered the union, the government of the Republic of Cyprus became the only EU recognized government in the island, but Greek Cypriots rejected a half-baked reunification plan that was ultimately against them (that's why it was strongly supported by Turkey). Needless to say that many were furious after that development. Following that, Germany had to rely to Austria and France's conservatives, with the occasional Scandinavian anti-Turkish overtones.

Le sous-reddit /r/french est dans la sidebar et ta question devrait y être posée plutôt qu'ici.

Btw :

&gt;Cher Guilhem, J'ai été en Espagne avec mes parents.

""Aller"" would be better than ""être"" in this case

&gt;J'y suis resté deux semaines.

Are you female or male ? Here, it means you are a male.

&gt;There was a beautfiul weather every day.

Literally you must say ""The weather was beautiful every day""

&gt;Nous étions à l'hôtel aux Pyrénées d'Espagne.

&gt;J'ai passé à la Barcelone une journée 

No ""le"" or ""la"" before a city name (unless with the formulation ""Le/La .... que ..."" for instance : ""Le Paris que j'ai connu...""). Isn't it the same than in English ?

&gt;et j'ai vu beaucoup.

Translated word to word. Seen many *what* ?

&gt;Je suis allée en voiture.

Are you female or male ? Here, it means you are a female. Although technically correct, this sentence sounds very unnatural. ""J'y suis allée en voiture"" would be better I think.

&gt;Mais c'était difficile de trouver le parking en ville. 

""*Le* parking"" or ""*un* parking"" ?

&gt;Nous avond trouvé le parking

Avons*.

&gt;Mais quand nous rentions au parking,

rentrions*. The verb is ""rentrer"".

&gt;nous ne trouvions pas la voiture.

I would have use passé simple but yours is grammatically correct too.

&gt; Le parking était immense. Nous avons cherché deux heures.

&gt; Au soir , nous revenais plus tard à la hôtel.

Hôtel is masculine so ""le hôtel"", since the h is not pronounced there is an ""élision"" (apocope peut être?) so ""l'hôtel""

You need to conjuge revenr with ""nous"" (so : revenions). I would also have used passé simple here. 

&gt;Mais c'était un journée chouette. 

You may find better adjectves than ""chouette""

&gt;Tu as été en Hollande?

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holland != Netherlands

&gt;C'était comment?

&gt; Au revoir! Je vous remercie d'avance!!! xx

""xx"" is not used in French. 

Before some punctuation ( ? ; : !), in French French (not Quebec), you need an ""espace fine insécable"" which is roughly just a space.

e.g. I need you**!** vs J'ai besoin de toi **!** (notice the space before ""!"")

Due to our legislative system (voted into being by -- gasp! -- the Parliament, and heartily defended by the folks who just lost majority), serious legal investigation of an MP requires approval from the Parliament. Guess whose actions face legal investigation and whose don't. It's not due to lack of lexical diversity that I called them mobsters.

This parliament is as bad as the previous one. The disaster of these elections lays in the fact that it's bad, not in the fact that it's worse -- because it's not. It's just as bad.

Today, Hungarians have broad rights, the language is used by the state institutions wherever there are at least 20% Hungarians, and nobody gets paranoid about Transylvania secceding. Hell, Hungary is one of our closest allies, and was a big advocate of our integration into the EU.

My point is that Kurdish TV and press and other baby steps is the way to do it., and although people's mindsets change slowly, they do change.

It's run by two brothers (one is the chef and the other is the waiter) so the place is small which creates an intimate atmosphere. The food is very reasonably priced for such high quality - 3 courses with wine was around $50. The interior is really like a bistro, with red tones and soothing music. The reservations are a hit or miss as I booked a few days in advance with no problem, while my friend tried 2 weeks in advance and couldn't manage to snag a spot. I encourage you to try anyways!

Les Ombres - Les Ombres translates to ""The Shadows"" and you will be, quite literally, in the shadows of the Eiffel Tower. It's located above the Museum Quai Branly and it offers a fantastic view of Paris by night. The food and service is great but really on par with any expensive-tourist like restaurant.

**For fancy:**
Le Violon d'Ingres
This restaurant is actually part of a set of very famous restaurants by Maison Constant with this one being the most upscale. (The other two are on the same street ironically). The other one ""Les Cocottes"" was well received by food critic Anthony Bourdain, and this one is just the icing on the cake. I recommend Le Violon because it's more suiting for a special birthday dinner. It's also a stone's throw from the Eiffel Tower which would be nice for a post dinner walk around! Since it's a bit famous, good luck on reservations!

The only way we can have rational discussion about immigration is if it is not being polarized and derailed by people who are explicitly racist.

This forum without moderation will degrade like all the other internet forums infested by xenophobes and absurd fringe ideologues.

I agree that we need to have open discussion about immigration, but that discussion should not and can not include people who are openly racist, and employing hate speech. If you talk about 'gangs of savages' or blood running through the streets, you should be banned.

As for your second point, if the intention of the ""intervention"" was not to restore the legitimate government of Cyprus, then it has no legal basis at all. From the Treaty of Guarantee:

&gt; Article II: Greece, **Turkey** and the United Kingdom, taking note of the undertakings of the Republic of Cyprus set out in Article I of the present Treaty, recognise and **guarantee** the independence, **territorial integrity** and security of the Republic of Cyprus, and also the state of affairs established by the Basic Articles of its Constitution.

&gt; Greece, Turkey and the United Kingdom likewise undertake to **prohibit**, so far as concerns them, any activity aimed at promoting, directly or indirectly, either union of Cyprus with any other State or **partition** of the Island. ...

&gt; Article IV: In so far as common or concerted action may not prove possible, each of the three guaranteeing Powers reserves **the right to take action with the sole aim of re-establishing the state of affairs created by the present Treaty**.

It is obvious that the aim of Turkey's invasion of Cyprus was not to restore the constitutional government of Cyprus. Consequently, Turkey's actions were *not* allowed by the Treaty of Guarantee, and are no different from, say, Syria just randomly invading, occupying, and colonizing a third of the island. I have no issue blaming Greece for the coup, but there is a world of difference between a coup and an invasion. The coup disrupted the government of Cyprus, but the invasion created a whole new demographic and political reality on the island. 

Both Greece and Turkey acted against their treaty obligations, but Turkey's actions were far worse, affected far more people, and continue on to the present day.

true,h2orat,null,null,"I can give you a few areas and restaurants, but often just wandering around the different areas of the city and discovering it for yourself is half the fun.  I would recommend taking advantage of the bike system that is set up throughout the city.  It's called [Velib](http://en.velib.paris.fr/) and it is easy to ""rent"" a bike in one location and returning it in another location in the city.  This is a great way to get from one part of the city to another, other than the metro, and allows you to see the city.

I am a big fan of Montmartre.  It's the old artisan area in the north area of Paris (18th arr).  I would recommend starting around the Abbesses metro stop and walk towards the base of Sacre Coeur (park area).  The area around Abbesses is fantastic, and then it's a nice walk up to Sacre Coeur.  From Sacre Coeur, if you walk behind the cathedral to the west you'll be in the main tourist area of Montmartre.  It's nice to see and very busy, but other than just seeing it, I'm not a fan.  However, one of my favorite restaurants is just to the east of the cathedral (down the stairs).  It's a location called [L'Ete en Pente Douce](http://www.tripadvisor.fr/Restaurant_Review-g187147-d719112-Reviews-L_Ete_en_Pente_Douce-Paris_Ile_de_France.html) and is in a wonderful little square.  Another plus is that once you finish your meal, you can take the rest of your wine bottle, or purchase a new one (this is what I would recommend), back up to the top of Sacre-Coeur and sit on the steps.  It's a wonderful view of Paris at night and no one cares about people drinking on the steps.

Speaking about drinking in public, if you truly wish to do the Parisian ""thing"" I would recommend taking a night to build a picnic from a local grocery store (or combination of butcher, cheese, and wine stores).  Then take your supplies out onto the grass of Champ de Mars which is the park area connected to the Eiffel Tower.  Unfortunately, and someone will have to confirm this, I am forgetting when they open grass area for the public.  You may have to go by the Eiffel tower one morning (to go up) and while you are there, notice whether or not they have fences keeping people out of the grass areas.

For a good night of drinking there are SEVERAL areas you can go.  To the west of metro stop Place Monge (5th Arr.) is [Rue Mouffetard](http://goo.gl/maps/rQUVw).  This area is where a lot of the students go because it's close to a lot of universities.  There are many great cheap bars and small little cafes.  [Grand Boulevards](http://goo.gl/maps/7dfSN') (10th arr) is another area with many options for bars, but many of them also turn into night clubs after a certain hour.  Finally, the area between metro stops [Mabillon, Odeon, and Saint-Michel](http://goo.gl/maps/ue7jv) is great.

I know I'm giving you a lot to do/see in the few days you have, but if there is one thing you need to understand is that if you have a sense of adventure and be willing to just say ""fuck it"" when deciding where to do for dinner, you'll have a good time.  While not all restaurants I've been to were home runs, most of them were still very nice and comfortably priced.  Especially the set meals.

Also, I think most places have prefix menus which I thought were awesome.  A predetermined price (seemed like most that we found were usually between 15 and 30 euros) for a predetermined number of courses... 3 or 4.  You get like 5-8 choices per course on what you want to eat and all of the ones we tried were great.  We did go to a place one night and the prefix menus were like 35 and 50 euros for 4 or 5 courses... but the rest of the menu prices were along the same lines, so it was no surprise.

Also, crepes and random street stalls were always cheap and delicious.  The kebabs all seemed to be pretty good.  It's similar to a gyro.  It was plenty to fill you up and only cost about 4 or 5 euros for one.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"Keep in mind that the discussions we're having here are about politics on the European level. The way the EU is currently structured, with most of the decisions being negotiated between national governments, this results in politics that aren't unlike other international relations. If you look at geopolitics in general, you'll find that overall policy goals of countries tend to be remarkably consistent over time. Take Britain's Balance of Power policy, for instance. This has dominated their policy vs. the Continent over centuries, independently from changing power structures at home.  
That's a result of the automatism resulting from circumstances I've been talking about above. What we see in Europe isn't quite as pronounced, but you can still observe it in principle. The national governments try to follow their respective constituencies' and therefore their perceived national interests (and are under populist pressure -- just look at the euroskeptic sentiment in the UK, a possible exit would be decidedly *not* in their long term national interest), although there may be disagreements at home what exactly those are, based on how the parties rank priorities and whether they focus on the long- or short term. No matter if those governments are conservative or progressive, the underlying domestic factors remain the same, so what you usually get are just different shades of the same overall strategies that are dictated by the hand they've been dealt (i.e., their respective domestic situation) and the rules of the game.

So, Red/Green wouldn't actually do anything that would be *fundamentally* different, in regards to Europe (other Germans might disagree with this statement, but I'm talking in broad terms here). Of course there would be differences, and of course I don't agree with everything they propose just like I don't agree with everything Merkel does. But the underlying principles are similar enough to be a bit of a problem for the opposition, because now they have to run an election campaign where they can't even point to *fundamental* differences and have to explain details instead. Instead they have to say things like, yeah, she eventually came around and did the right thing, but she should have done so earlier. And they're right -- that Merkel dragged her feet early on in the crisis has cost us a lot of money and political capital.  
Also, there *are* fundamental differences once you consider the CSU, parts of which would be totally fine with cutting Greece loose, and that's just crazy. This, along with the general instability of her coalition with the FDP, hinders Merkel's ability to act without relying on the help of the opposition. And of course there are differences once we get to European integration, although both sides want that in principle (because: see first half of this post).

But as I said, there are other policy areas as well, I won't vote based on European politics alone.

That is also an attitude that I hate. While you are correct that no EU country hasn't experienced mass immigration, that doesn't mean that mean that there hasn't been problems with immigration and that those problems aren't real or need to be fixed.

For example the biggest immigrant group in Finland are Russians, 58331. You very seldom hear about this group, however you do hear and experience much more from 14045 Somali immigrants and from approx. 27-28 thousand people from all over middle-east. The thing is that they have a different culture and they have very real problems on adjusting and assimilating to our post-industrial society.

We can't just shutdown our eyes from these problems and just take more immigrants, because that will only cause the problems to become bigger and worse to solve. We don't want to repeat mistakes of central European countries. Immigrants that come here need to be efficiently assimilated to the Finnish culture and society, not just meaning that they learn to cope in here, they need to completely abandon their culture and melt to the Finnish culture.

Very Swedish of you.

The amusing thing is that your countrymen (and probably you to a degree as well) still have ""ways"" of airing your cultural superiority, because this death-of-conversation attitude will prevent actual debate.

I was in Petra, Jordan, a year or two ago and almost had to deal with a situation. A Russian girl I was with ended up talking with some sort of local guide who was hiking the same way with us. He ended up explaining how he had lived 3 years in Sweden and fucking **hated** Swedes and would beat the shit out of one if he ever encountered one.

The whole situation was quite interesting for a number of reasons:       
**a**) The logic of why he hated Swedes. Apparently he felt completely shut out while in Sweden, and that while the people there tolerated him, the condescension level was intolerable and that none *really* thought he was good for anything beyond sweeping the floor or driving a taxi, while at the same time convincing themselves they weren't racist because grads from the top universities (of any race) could land great jobs. It's just that if you only had a high school degree, a Swede could make CEO, a Palestinian could sweep the floors.   

**b**) I was surprised that I ended up talking with him making the clear point that while I sympathized, I didn't approve even a little of his plans of attacking a random Swede, and that for all intents and purposes he could consider me (with roughly 20cm and 15kg of mainly muscle over him) a Swede. He did not end up attacking me, though it seriously felt for a moment that he might. Brother and sister people indeed.


The main point I'm wanting to make is that you can kill the conversation and hide the racism under covers, but that isn't really the best solution as it only drives the problem underground. Oh, it's probably a good solution in a place where the minority already **is** there (US blacks are the most obvious case of this) and even a bad solution is better than no solution, but that doesn't change the fact that it's not an ideal solution. The discussion *should* happen.

**Layer 1**: The actual loud mouth racists who might actually hate a number of minorities what sensible people consider insane levels of passion (hell, the hate on a varied group is insane to begin with). These are the people posting the craziest shit on the internet.

**Layer 2**: People who are silent supporters of cultural homogeneity. These people tend to be older and white and just disapprove of anything messing with the great culture of the West, as if it was made of fucking paper. It's done so well because it **IS** good, but it's good exactly because it isn't afraid to be fucking challenged. By trying to defend it with violence or proxies to violence, you're effectively defiling it. My father for example might be considered a part of this group - he doesn't really have anything against minorities, but he does disapprove the hell out of a number of them being in Finland (while considering it a low priority issue)

**Layer 3**: This is the most significant group. This is the roughly 30-70% of population that is a little apprehensive of certain minorities. Not hateful or anything, but apprehensive. Often younger people who aren't necessarily racist, but who've been in 2-3 violent situations in their whole lives, of which somehow magically 2 were with minorities representing 1.5% of the national population. They know people from said minorities they get along with great and can respect for their intellectual abilities, but are also aware that a lot of the crime stats are worrying. The cause of this is unclear, but that's a good reason for looking in to it, as it'd have a reasonable shot at clearing the air. As long as even looking in to the crime stats is considered racism, it's impossible to disprove the ""group X is inherently violent"" hypothesis. This group doesn't really know what to think and tries to play judge by silently supporting both suppression of overt racism and overt political correctness - something you can see at play in /r/europe (I would consider myself a member of this group).


The amusing(?) thing is that Islamic fundamentalism works in a very similar way, with the Layer 1 being tiny (0-2% of the population or whatever) and even Layer 2 being totally insufficient to actually hide in for very long (up to 15-20%... kind of what the more or less openly racist parties in Europe can pull in). However, Layer 3 is ambivalent because they dislike letting the opposite viewpoint (in Islamic case: USA is a beacon of hope in the world!) dominate, because the opposing viewpoint doesn't really deal with reality very well. Oh, it could in theory because it does make sense (USA *is* a super advanced democracy with some of the finest achievements mankind has ever achieved under its belt, both in terms of human well being and humanitarian activity.

We wandered around looking for people and eventually ended up in front of the city hall with a bunch of other confused looking guiris (foreigners) who thought, like we did, that at least there we would be able to hear the bells chime (the city hall has a huge clock tower). At midnight there was only silence but we waited and waited for some confirmation of the New Year but got nothing.

No, THAT is exactly what I'd consider unwelcoming. I'm admittedly sick of tourists as well.

They don't want any other solutions. They ignore the problem which leads to crimes. What is being done to prevent crimes committed by poor immigrants? Halting immigration and deporting ones who become criminal? That doesn't seemed to have worked elsewhere.

&gt; The thing is that they have a different culture and they have very real problems on adjusting and assimilating to our post-industrial society.

One of my best friends is English-born-Sudanese and he has spent almost all of his life in Sudan, now he is living and studying in the UK. To make a broad generalisation by saying ""they have a different culture"" is incorrect because it includes him and he is not an exception because there are plenty of immigrants who live good and normal lives. The difference between him and refugees are that they come from completely different socioeconomic backgrounds and have completely different opportunities in life.

I don't know what mistakes you are talking about but assimilation is wrong. A country should never ask its immigrants and refugees to give up their traditions, religion, customs, and language. Especially since many refugees don't have their own country (like Kurds, Roma, and Jews before Israel). However they should function in society as any other civilian like paying taxes and not committing crimes. If the minority is sizable then they should receive their own cultural centers or places of worship because they pay tax. If there many different cultures then maybe a law should change how some certain holidays/religious events function. Ex. One gets x amount of ""free days"" which they can only spend on days which has a tradition. This way all people can celebrate their traditional and religious holidays plus it could be more practical as non-Christians would work during Christmas. There doesn't need to be assimilation, people just have to be able to live with each other in peace.

C'est pourtant ce que beaucoup de boites essayaient de faire à l'époque, parce que tout simplement il était évident depuis longtemps que la pub rapporteraient ou à défaut qu'avoir de nombreux utilisateurs devait forcément rapporter (c'était vraiment l'esprit des startups avant 2001).

Là encore, si l'on oublie le rhétorique ""virtuellement illimité"", Google n'était pas le premier.

He is sympathetic with the Turkish-Cypriots (as we should be), and even though I dislike him as a President, he gives a lot of tolerance to the Turkish Cypriots. 

You have to realise that we do not hate the Turks of Cyprus. We want to liberate them. They are part of the Republic of Cyprus. They are citizens of the country, and indeed they have eqal rights. They can claim their homes they lost in '74, and in a heartbeat they are given back to them. I have seen it for myself, Turkish Cypriots living in their old homes in Larnaca. We are sympathetic to the Turkish Cypriots and we accept them. Why are our homes out of bounds? Why are we still refugees? Why is our country still occupied and invaded?

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; One doesn't raise a problem about integration by first citing statistics which are related to immigration. People who raise these statistics care about numbers. They want to halt immigration and deport any immigrant who commit crimes, even if it could result to their death. They don't want any other solutions. They ignore the problem which leads to crimes. What is being done to prevent crimes committed by poor immigrants? Halting immigration and deporting ones who become criminal? That doesn't seemed to have worked elsewhere.

You yourself make the jump to halting immigration completely. What I'm saying and many others are too that we need to put a limit to immigration, we need to define a count that we can commit to, that we can provide needed language courses, culture courses, vocational or other education, housing, money, etc... So that they don't just end up in one problem housing estate without job, without way to become employed, without being able to assimilate to the local culture.

And no, this isn't just about money. This is about culture beliefs. For example for children of immigrants to succeed in Finland, they need to be instilled belief that education is important, that getting a occupation or degree is must to get a job. Not to mention cultural values, respect for individual freedom and gender equality. For example it is not acceptable for parents to circumcision their girls, it is not acceptable that girls or boys are send back to their home country if they don't behave as their parents want. Those are all against values of the Finnish society.

&gt;  One of my best friends is English-born-Sudanese and he has spent almost all of his life in Sudan, now he is living and studying in the UK. To make a broad generalisation by saying ""they have a different culture"" is incorrect because it includes him and he is not an exception because there are plenty of immigrants who live good and normal lives. The difference between him and refugees are that they come from completely different socioeconomic backgrounds and have completely different opportunities in life.

And I have many Somali friends who are refugees, who did assimilate to this society so that their children are fully Finnish in every sense. However not all Somalis are have succeeded in settling here, on becoming Finnish. And the only way they can become Finnish is to address the group, look on what is happening and figure out what can be done to fix them. If you just deny that for example immigrants make more rapes per capita than native Finns, then you are not ever going to find out that yes some cultures do disrespect women and have very misogynists views.

&gt; I don't know what mistakes you are talking about but assimilation is wrong. A country should never ask its immigrants and refugees to give up their traditions, religion, customs, and language. Especially since many refugees don't have their own country (like Kurds, Roma, and Jews before Israel). However they should function in society as any other civilian like paying taxes and not committing crimes. If the minority is sizable then they should receive their own cultural centers or places of worship because they pay tax. If there many different cultures then maybe a law should change how some certain holidays/religious events function. Ex. One gets x amount of ""free days"" which they can only spend on days which has a tradition. This way all people can celebrate their traditional and religious holidays plus it could be more practical as non-Christians would work during Christmas. There doesn't need to be assimilation, people just have to be able to live with each other in peace.

This is Finland, this is home to the Finnish nation, to Finnish culture, to Finnish way of life. If you come and settle here, you are expected to become Finnish, you will abandon your own culture and you will assimilate. That is how it has always been, and that is how it should be in the future. Our culture is different and unique from other cultures and we respect our culture and heritage, we keep it so.

Not to mention that I myself think that current Finnish culture and society are superior to many other cultures. We are one of the richest and most developed countries in the world and that is not because we have good soil or lots of natural riches, it is because our culture and society have adopted successful ways to live, function and compete globally. We don't need to export or enforce our way of life to people in other countries, but people who come here need adopt our way of life, not the other way.

&gt; If you would ever move to Sweden, would you assimilate and give up your Finnish culture? Because that's exactly what you're saying and I'm hoping you've misunderstood what the term assimilation really means.

Yes and that is exactly how Finnish immigrants have done. I was actually born in Sweden, my parents however made the decision to come back Finland because they wanted their children to become Finnish and live in Finland. If we would have staid, I would be talking Swedish as my native language, and Finnish in a very broken away, and that would have been just fine.

It's extremely annoying when everyone tries to polarize the discussion, when the grown up debate is somewhere in the middle.

For example in Finland the whole immigration debate is quite simple:      
a) How do we make sure people are coming here to live and be productive, rather than just leech off the welfare state (Finns being Finns find it tremendously unlikely that someone is coming to the country for the wonderful people, cultural depth and the weather... you're in it to enhance your lifestyle either via work or welfare)?

b) Our refugees seem to misbehave. Why? Is there something we should be doing to help? Should we stop the troublesome minorities from growing in size until we figure this out? When I last lived in Finland, the only group with any real problems was the rather small group of Somali refugees... and the cold hard fact there was that a lot of that came from the fact that when they arrived in Finland originally, Finland was like, KKK racist. We've improved tons, but first impressions must have been quite something for them. Can this situation be salvaged from that? If, how? If it can't be salvaged, what should we do about that? What should we do if the same case reoccurs with another minority? We surely should get involved earlier to try and solve it rather than wringing our hands and doing nothing, but *what*?

I grew up in London, I know for a fact that only 45% of the population are now white British, thats to say I know quiet a few people who have chosen to move to the UK.

Where I lived many of the immigrants integrated well, I happened to live near Hornchurch which has a wealthy Indian population of Doctors in emerson park, one of the wealthiest places in London. Those people integrated very well, in fact they set a better example than most native Brits at success and what can be achieved with hard work.

I have full respect for immigrants which integrate but respect their routes like myself, I am half French and Quarter German, I however still consider myself British and respect where I came from.

My question is what makes these individuals special that their culture should be superior to that of the country they now chose to inhabit?

The problem I see is that EU and the relations with EU is still much, pretty much everywhere, a very juicy bargain chip for domestic politicians to put pressure on their electorate, more than a practical problem aimed at bettering the overall European Union as an institution. 

We're in this together. On one side because we are (more or less) linked by agreements and treaties, but also because we are geographically united. I really wish we could look forward and see that to compromise in certain individual national powers, if worked with the right goal in mind and not just to win your seat back, isn't that bad of a deal for a greater and more coherent European Union that will, inevitably, work better than the current incomplete state of affair.",0,1355316239,null,0,false,0,c7fcurs,t3_14ovg7,t1_c7fcurs,t1_c7fcrtr,null,1430652136,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

Just a few racists adding each other to their friends lists and occasionally checking for each other's submissions could easily change the tone of this subreddit, especially since the sentiment is actually there. So, the goal would be to have a thread about Muslims or Roma from normal mainstream news sources every other day to [set the agenda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agenda-setting_theory) and then post a few comments that aren't overtly extremist but ""reasonable people that are concerned"". It's about making racism socially acceptable. And, yeah, why not throw in the occasional red herring about Islam not being a race when somebody accuses anyone of racism.

I agree with you on the legitimacy of a form of protest for a way of doing things that doesn't suit your view, but I am not completely sure this applies to what and why the UK is actually doing and how it is behaving. The implication is quite simple in my view: if you're talking on one side about pulling out of certain aspects of ""the Union"" while at the same time pretending your voice to still be heard under the same weight at the table where decisions are made, in my opinion, you're just being a capricious kid who has no proposals to put forward and want's to be listened to regardless of the validity of your points.

I guess here is were I'm really upset with Mr. Cameron's government ways of dealing with this: he is doing it more to please his back-benchers than he his doing this to send a message to Europe. 

The European Union (and the single currency) as it is, it's a broken toy, I couldn't agree more on that, but it's broken mainly because it's an unfinished project that has been put on hold because of single nation interests for too long. It's something that should have progressed more and more and that, by remaining incomplete is creating the hurt and problems you speak about. **Exactly** because the UK is big it should, like Germany and France should as well, take up the responsibility of seeing this as the problem. To me it's the middle way that will don anything but maintain the status-quo that is creating the problems: you either push forward with integration into a stronger political/economical union or you pull out all together and you come back to being a totally separate entity (and by large, scrap the EU project all together).

true,adamkex,SWED,Hungarian in disguise,"&gt; You yourself make the jump to halting immigration completely. What I'm saying and many others are too that we need to put a limit to immigration, we need to define a count that we can commit to, that we can provide needed language courses, culture courses, vocational or other education, housing, money, etc... So that they don't just end up in one problem housing estate without job, without way to become employed, without being able to assimilate to the local culture.

[This poster is not very old.](http://i.imgur.com/MGlh4.jpg) We do provide language courses and there is something called *instegsjobb* which is there to make it easier for specifically refugees to get jobs and to function in society. SD were against this because they thought it was discriminating to Swedes. We don't want assimilation, we want them **to be a part of our society**, whatever their religious beliefs, native language (as long as they learn our's) and customs is none of my business. Also we don't have free immigration, a majority of people who seek asylum are denied.

&gt; And no, this isn't just about money. This is about culture beliefs. For example for children of immigrants to succeed in Finland, they need to be instilled belief that education is important, that getting a occupation or degree is must to get a job. Not to mention cultural values, respect for individual freedom and gender equality. For example it is not acceptable for parents to circumcision their girls, it is not acceptable that girls or boys are send back to their home country if they don't behave as their parents want. Those are all against values of the Finnish society.

I think in most of the cultures in the world it is expected to get a job, as higher education isn't available for the majority of the people in some parts of the world. What cultural values are we talking about? Gender equality and individual freedom? Gender equality is still a problem in our current society. Men still go around and use sex-related insults. Women's salary are still lower than men's salary. There has been no PM in Sweden who has been a woman (however I think our current government has more female ministers than male ministers). SD who claim to be protecting women's rights from Muslims and immigrants in general are dominated by men. Individual freedom as we see it today is also something relatively new to the West, especially gay rights. Also our individual freedom isn't something we can take granted for just because ""it's our culture"". New laws are every now and then trying to be passed regarding surveillance and wiretapping. Also you don't seem to be a big fan of individual freedom because you want everybody in Finland to become Finnish and to abandon their own culture in favor of your's.

&gt; And I have many Somali friends who are refugees, who did assimilate to this society so that their children are fully Finnish in every sense. However not all Somalis are have succeeded in settling here, on becoming Finnish. And the only way they can become Finnish is to address the group, look on what is happening and figure out what can be done to fix them. If you just deny that for example immigrants make more rapes per capita than native Finns, then you are not ever going to find out that yes some cultures do disrespect women and have very misogynists views.

These views have always existed among men from all cultures. 200 years ago in Europe there was also a lot of disrespect for women. Even today many people from countries like [Sweden](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=mPycz-tsrDM#t=31s) and Finland disrespect women. You can be from a culture where many people have these views without being a misogynist, the same way you can be a Christian and not think the world is 6000 years old.

&gt; This is Finland, this is home to the Finnish nation, to Finnish culture, to Finnish way of life. If you come and settle here, you are expected to become Finnish, you will abandon your own culture and you will assimilate. That is how it has always been, and that is how it should be in the future. Our culture is different and unique from other cultures and we respect our culture and heritage, we keep it so.

Or what? In the situation if I were to move to Finland would you kick me out if I reject becoming Finnish? Why are you telling me what to do and what to think? As long as I learn your language and live a normal life you can't do anything and you shouldn't want to do anything if you actually believe in individual freedom. Regarding of religious buildings like mosques, synagogues, foreign churches, temples or places of worship from any other religion. If there is a sizable minority which requests the building to either be built, converted from any other type of building, or even a permit they should be denied because you want to ""preserve"" your culture? Denying a permit would be against freedom of religion. They are after all paying tax and they are likely to want to as much as possible collaborate. What about Finnish Jews? Jews have been in Europe for a very long time. Why can't you respect someone else's culture and heritage? Not everybody is as lucky as you who can practice it without being prosecuted.

&gt; Not to mention that I myself think that current Finnish culture and society are superior to many other cultures. We are one of the richest and most developed countries in the world and that is not because we have good soil or lots of natural riches, it is because our culture and society have adopted successful ways to live, function and compete globally. We don't need to export or enforce our way of life to people in other countries, but people who come here need adopt our way of life, not the other way.

I don't want to comment on your remark that you think Finnish culture is superior to many other ones. Finland has an excellent society but not definitely perfect with your condescending attitude to other cultures. Finland is rich, liberal, with good education and good health. Those are the reasons many other countries look up to Finland, not because of Moomin or your traditional foods. No other country is enforcing their way of life onto Finland, but with your attitude you are enforcing all non-Finns to become Finns regardless if they want it or not. Was there any infrastructure when Finland became independent? Cause if there was then that's one of the reasons Finland is successful. Also Finland didn't have to struggle with countless dictatorships after independence. Which seems to be a common denominator in Middle Eastern and African countries.

&gt; Yes and that is exactly how Finnish immigrants have done. I was actually born in Sweden, my parents however made the decision to come back Finland because they wanted their children to become Finnish and live in Finland. If we would have staid, I would be talking Swedish as my native language, and Finnish in a very broken away, and that would have been just fine.

That should be their choice to assimilate or not. And if were to be grown up here and your parents would actually try then you'd have two native languages. In Sweden we would have supported you to be Finnish if that is what you would want by giving you the privilege to study Finnish after school.",0,1355319035,null,0,false,0,c7fd7yc,t3_14oq15,t1_c7fd7yc,t1_c7fcgrz,null,1430652315,-3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-3

Think about what used to be acceptable levels of racism, let's put all that at one end, and call it the ""right"", so things like Nazi's genocide of jews &amp; racial superiority laws. Then moving rightwards we roughly get: slavery based on race is legal, no slavery, but it's illegal to teach (say) black people how to read, enforced segration of races in marriage &amp; education (e.g. apartheid south africa), making discrimination like that outright illegal (all modern laws in EU &amp; USA), …

I'm not sure what's at the other end (the ""left"" side), Do you know?

""people who act as if anyone who is not favor of mass immigration is literally Hitler"" is an example given earlier, but ""Oh no someone called me hitler"" seems so massively less worse than ""All black people are property and not real humans"", that i don't think ""being called hitler"" is the opposite of it.

The vast majority of people (even in EU &amp; USA) are far to the ""left"" of the middle of the racism scale. After all the vast majority of the population (of EU &amp; USA) think that it should be legal for (say) 2 people of different ethnicities/races to marry. That's so far from ""black people are property"". Vast majority of the people are far from the centre on ""race"".

This is not a reasonable position to hold. Nor is putting all the blame of the past 4 decades squarely on Turkey's shoulders. If Turkish Cypriots are demanding self determination and/or independence, who are you to deny this to them? Why do they have to live under Greek rule? 
You say you're disappointed that the Turkish minority voted for Eroğlu, how is this Turkey's fault? And how come nothing was accomplished even under the previous government? Were they nationalists too? 

See I don't agree with the Turkish side claiming a third of the island. They owned 10% prior to the invasion and that's all they're entitled to. But neither do I agree with the position that the Turkish minority should have to give in to Greek demands of living as a minority under Greek rule. If you recall the instability of the 60s and 70s was partly based on this, with the Greek side denying the Turkish side any rights to federalism or self determination even after Makarios scrapped Enosis. Now you're saying the only way forward is to go back to that time. 

As I see it you can fault Turkey for bringing in settlers from the Black Sea region in Turkey. And you can fault Turkey for occupying 30% of the island and causing extreme hardship for the Greeks in those areas. 

But you cannot blame Turkey for Turkish Cypriots refusing Greek rule. 

Also I didn't misinterpret you at all. You said if I claimed that only Turks were cleansed I'd be a bigot. I pointed out that you actually hold the position that any crimes committed against Turks are fairy tales, thus making you the bigot if anything.

I guess not.

In the case of amateur football ethnicity of an aggressor is simply irrelevant. Amateur football is across the board filled with over-aggressive types. You can find clubs where you better not start a fight in predominantly white low-class neighbourhoods and you can also find particularly violent and anti-social players in rural areas, where having a few ""immigrants"" on your team is often the thing that seems to provoke these **white** farmers the most. And just like that you can also find clubs with predominantly low-class immigrants that are more likely to cause a fight than other people.
On top of that, hooligans are virtually all white too. Project X Haren was white people.

So what exactly are people not publicizing here? Newspapers need to report the relevant facts, and anyone who has spend time in their youth at the field knows that immigrants really are not the exception when it comes to violence.

Furthermore, I've seen plenty of fights where people have been hit in the head at the football field. People have been lucky to not have died more on the field yet, because if you are a bit unlucky you die at the first punch thrown at your head. With my 13 years of football, I'd say it is rather surprising the first killer on the field since ages is not white and seems rather unlikely.

I've seen plenty of people lose control simply because an enemy verbally provoked them, and run in with the full intent to hit hard and often.

All the other parties are not open to this policy and the result is that they become a martyr. The grown up thing for SD to do is to change their position and to compromise about the issue. In fact they do the complete opposite by condemning everything which the government with support of other parties does to try to help to solve the situation.
