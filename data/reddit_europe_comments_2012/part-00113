true,lebenohnestaedte,null,null,"I just wired a few thousand to my German account today. $30 fee and it takes five days to clear.

My local bank offered to waive the fee if I took a money order with me, but I'll be in Germany by the end of the week and don't really have the luxury of waiting up to 30 days for everything to be cleared (sometimes it takes awhile). So wiring it was worth it, even if there's a fee. You want to make sure you have all the info right, though, because you're going to lose money in the conversion if they have to go back and forth. (E.g. US dollars to euros, but there's an issue or error somewhere so they convert it back into US dollars and return it to your account, and now you don't have any money AND you've lost a portion of it in the currency conversion.)

Disclaimer: this is what I understood of what they told me at the bank. I may be incorrect or have a sketchy understanding of things.

If you have the luxury, I would definitely recommend transferring a large amount at a time (a few thousand dollars) instead of doing it monthly or something.

2. Property rights are important to Liberals, because they see property as the foundation of free enterprise. Therefore, they are generally averse to taxes. They see taxes as a necessary evil and only support taxes that don't burden a certain class of people more than another.

I haven't lived in southern Europe, so I can't speak with any authority about how things are like there, but maybe I would dare to induce that there are some parallels. If Greeks don't want to pay their taxes, is it because they're irresponsible? I would argue no. It's rather because in general, people don't believe in the commons.

In any case, there is a difference between a word like ""asshole"", that's just a commentary on your behaviour (which you can often change), and words like ""stupid"", that comment on the recipient's physical or mental capacity, that he is often stuck with and may have no control over.

Day 2 makes no sense at all. I have family in Pompeii, have been there dozens of times and regularly get lost in it. It is huge: it was a city, you know. Naples by itself would take at least 3 days to se the basics, plus you are not calculating traffic at all (and by the way consider train, I know that Americans don't remember them, but they are a much better way for tourists to move).
Day 3 would allow you to spend about 1 minute in each of those places and take 1 photo. Your daughter would die. Circus Maximus is hundreds of years older than Nero by the way. The Spanish Steps is a staircase for Japanese people to go shopping and, if not explained, the Pantheon is just another church.
Day 4: read my comment in the other thread.
Day 5: what is your daughter supposed to do while you drink? Keep Pisa.
Day 6: Florence, at least there is something. Don't force your daughter up the Campanile di Giotto.
Day 7: Ditch Harry's Bar. Keep Murano, visit a glass factory but never go close to the things they make, because they explode. Add Burano.
Day 8: In Bologna there is enough stuff for a week. Look for a tour in the Alma Mater.
Day 9: The Accademia is not that much of a problem without tickets gotten ahead, but the Uffizi, the real highlight of the city, is. Add Palazzo Pitti and your daughter will love it.
Day 10: you could use this day if you travel back by train.

If an immigrant or their offsprings don't like the French culture, then find a country where your ways are accepted and move.

However it's been a while since I have visited Murano (so, no suggestions for it), but you could also visit Burano, especially in the late afternoon if you have enough time. It's a lovely (and really small) island, you can visit it all in a couple of hours max. Famous for its [lovely colourful houses](https://www.google.it/search?sugexp=chrome,mod%3D15&amp;q=burano&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=it&amp;tbm=isch&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=653&amp;sei=ha84ULr7OaX_4QSThYH4BA) and for the lacework.
You can reach Burano straight from Murano in 20 minutes with the Vaporetto.

In Venice you can

* visit Ponte di Rialto (one of the 4 bridges that crosses the Gran Canal).
* If you're hungry you can eat something in one of the few [bacari](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteria) near there (like at the ""cantina do mori"", ""ostaria dai zemei"" (&lt;--lot of great stuff to eat, in there), ""al diavolo l'acqua santa"") or in another place when you can eat ""arancini"" or ""mozzarelle in carrozza"" that is placed about [in there](http://maps.google.it/maps?q=45.437606,+12.337210&amp;num=1&amp;t=h&amp;vpsrc=6&amp;hl=it&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=45.437586,12.337158&amp;spn=0.001472,0.002642&amp;z=19&amp;iwloc=A) 
* visit San Marco and the Bridge of sights
* once you're at San Marco, you can take a Vaporetto and go back to Piazzale Roma
* (there's also [this place](https://plus.google.com/112011715632166963358/about?gl=it&amp;hl=it), that is famous for its spiral staircase)
* (PLUS: if you're into it, there's also the [Peggy Guggenheim museum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peggy_Guggenheim_Collection), 5€ if you're a student, 7€ otherwhise if I remember correctly. But it's not very close to San Marco)

HOW TO MOVE IN VENICE

The main way to move in Venice is (obviously) on foot :)

I would not recommend a gondola ride, as it could be very expensive.

You can easly move with the vaporetto. [Here](http://www.hellovenezia.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=69:tariffe&amp;catid=41&amp;Itemid=219&amp;lang=en) you can find the prices. A 12-hours travel card should fit your interests.

(for anyone else (between 14 and 29yo) planning to visit Venice a couple of days, I suggest doing [this Rolling Venice thing](http://www.hellovenezia.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=178&amp;Itemid=158&amp;lang=it) for the price of 4€ and then you can have the 72-hours ticket for the price of 18€ instead of 35€. So the total is 22€.)

So, once you arrive in Venice, you can:

* do the travelcard (without stamping it)
* walk wherever you want to go (campo santa margherita/ponte di rialto/whatever)
* ???
* profit!
* visit San Marco and the Bridge of Sights
* Stamp your ticket (and now it's valid for 12 hours), take the Vaporetto in San Marco and go back to Piazzale Roma (should be route number 1)
* once in Piazzale Roma take the Vaporetto for Murano (should be route number 13, orange)
* visit Murano (famous for its glasswork)
* OPTIONAL: visit Burano
* go back home

(for any other info, you can visit the [venetian public transport company's website](http://www.actv.it/en))

I don't even know if it's possible doing all this stuff in only one day, but if you do this, you should be halfway for the Venice Marathon ;)",0,1345892623,null,0,false,0,c5yip2d,t3_ysbo4,t1_c5yip2d,t3_ysbo4,null,1429731623,3,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,3

I'd like to add my two cents though :)

France is the by-product of intra-european migrations. It's only recently in time that migrants have starting coming from other continents but it doesn't strike me as big enough difference. French culture as it is most commonly understood is a snapshot from the recent-past (say pre-eighties or pre-seventies) and keeping that snapshot alive is a recipe for a disaster.

Previous generations have mis-handled immigration and discarded the issue way too easily and that's why (my opinion here) we are in a crappy situation with migrants and their sons not feeling French and being defiant. We can describe the situation as a divide between two loose groups and (still in my opinion) both groups will have to give in to work things out.

There's that thing I want to tell all migrants in France: if your identity card says you're French then you're my brother and I need you so we can all move forward in the one and only country we have.

If people could agree with me, cultures, racism, hate would be a non-issue.

Also, I agree with your ""there is discrimination based on race and economy everywhere"" stance. I have experienced it in Asia and that's why I want to put an end to it in my country.

I've never been in a restaurant in Venice (I only worked in a couple of them, and I wouldn't recommend any). Just don't go in any restaurant that has a waiter/waitress outside. Those are the most expensive.

I would suggest going in ""osterie"" ([bacari](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteria)), instead. There you can have some ""cicchetti"".

(on wikipedia, the definition of ""cicchetto"" refers about shot glasses, but the ""venetian"" difinition refers about small amount of food (i.e. a piece of bread with some raw ham and sun dried tomatoes on top, arancini, meatballs, etc) that you can eat while drinking a glass of wine, for example).

If you're into red wine, you could ask for a glass of ""Grintón"" or ""Clintòn"". 

I also suggest you to try a couple of ""[moscardini](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eledone_moschata) in umido"" (basically, octopus with tomatoes).

Also: if you take the Vaporetto and you are in one of the front seat, you have to sit or vaporetto drivers may yell at you because they can't see :) and be careful when you have to get in the vaporetto, because the vaporetto may move because of the wave motion and you may get stuck between the platform and the vaporetto.

Firstly that the idea of competitiveness seems to be widely accepted, that economies work not just by producing cool stuff, but providing it at a lower cost than your competitors, part of which comes from having competitive wage levels. 

Secondly, that huge increases in living standards are not inevitable and not immutable once achieved; when wages have increased by five times in the last twenty years, people are happy to accept temporary pay cuts to keep their jobs and their economy going. Thirdly that government debt should be kept low; really Ireland would be in a pretty healthy situation if they had allowed Anglo Irish to go under unaided (although admittedly larger countries like Italy and Spain wouldn't even have that option). And arguably a less relaxed attitude towards political corruption, or at the least, they wouldn't ever elect Berlisconi.

&gt; A price that is defined by the average amount of labour needed to make it with the average use of means of production.

No. What you're arguing for is the so-called *labour theory of value*, which has been debunked over 100 years ago. If something got its value from the amount of labour put in to it, then how do you explain differing prices for art? How do you explain that one precious metal is worth more than another even if it takes the same effort to get them out of the ground? How to you explain fashion? Why do people pay so much more for a coffee from Starbucks, surely that's not justified by extra labour?

The answer is that prices are a consequence of [marginal utility](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_utility).

&gt; And this is more a moral argument than a scientific one. If it would be the case that there are people who are 1000 times superior to others in respect to value making, then I am willing to abandon my maxim that man should be rewarded for his labour.

It's not that some people are 1000 times more superior. It's just that they happen to produce something that is valued 1000 time more. There is nothing inherently valuable in the work they do.

That's exactly the problem with government.
If something is not profitable, it should not be done. The fact that it is not profitable means that there are better uses for the resources. And the price system in a free market tells us exactly what those better uses are.

Entrepreneurs that put the resources to good use are rewarded with a profit, those that do not suffer a loss. However, if government makes an error in investment it only suffers indirectly (in the voting booth) or not all. The incentive for a politician is to get re-elected, not to turn a profit. A big project that's good PR in the short run is more important for him then an investment that turns out to be a good thing 20 years down the road.

Regarding roads: Corporations want to transport their goods to their customers, or the other way around. People want to move around. Thus, I'm sure that without a state private roads would still be build. I also suspect that many more people would use alternative means of transport that are cheaper than cars.

Regarding basic research: Private universities have to compete with one another for customers. Their product is education. Thus, they want to have the best faculty possible. However, to be a good teacher in academic science you need to be at the cutting edge of research. You can't do that without being a researcher yourself. Therefore, universities have a commercial interest in funding basic research.

As far as France is concerned though, there's some kind of a taboo on the matter when it comes to mentioning the perpetrators' origin; specifically, until recently no statistics on the matter were publicized. This has changed during the ""Sarkozy era"" (which has otherwise been terrible for immigrants). I do think those statistics are important and should be acknowledged because they help everybody realize there is a problem. The risk of misusing them is very high though but not accepting the problem and keeping the status-quo is riskier.

I said practical because that there are places where, within ten minutes of arrival and unless you are very well known, people (not all indeed) will insult you and play a passive-aggressive game so they can get into a fight. Those people can not be reasoned with and no amount of apologies for the discriminations they endure can do anything about the urgency of your physical situation.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; No. What you're arguing for is the so-called labour theory of value, which has been debunked over 100 years ago. If something got its value from the amount of labour put in to it, then how do you explain differing prices for art? How do you explain that one precious metal is worth more than another even if it takes the same effort to get them out of the ground? How to you explain fashion? Why do people pay so much more for a coffee from Starbucks, surely that's not justified by extra labour?

It has not been debunked at all. Attempts have been made but none of them really succeeded. If you read Marx and understand the theory you would know it. The marginal revolution was the best attempt that came out of these ideologically inspired efforts but the only result of that so called revolution was that the Labour theory of Value became the Labour theory of value with a footnote. 

Regarding your examples:
1. Art is not a commodity hence LTV does not apply
2. They wont
3 and 4. Fashionable items and Starbucks coffee is a hard one. Of course there's a lot of marketing needed, and thus labour, to make people believe their product is superior. But I personally don't think you could say this commodity fetishism is explained completely by the Labour theory of value. I see it as one of these instances were human fickleness causes some small disruptions in an otherwise perfect theory to explain economic reality.

But I'd rather have a sound theory about capitalist society with some small exceptions, than a theory that has no explanative value at all, and never had. The answer is not marginal utility.

I understand the theory. It's wrong. Except for Marxists, every economic school agrees with me. The reason why Marxists like the LTV is that it supports their ideological claims that capitalists are exploiting the workers.

&gt; The marginal revolution was the best attempt that came out of these ideologically inspired efforts but the only result of that so called revolution was that the Labour theory of Value became the Labour theory of value with a footnote.

No, the marginal theory of value is the complete opposite of the LTV. In the marginalist approach value flows from the consumer to the labour: Something is worth doing because the result is valued. In the LTV it's the other way around: Something is valued because someone put work into it. Those two are diametrically opposed. 

&gt; Regarding your examples: 1. Art is not a commodity hence LTV does not apply 

Of course art is a commodity. You can trade in paintings, for example. And if you insist that it isn't a commodity, then you have to explain where the value of non-commodities comes from.

&gt; 2\. They wont

Mining for gold and silver takes about the same amount of work. Yet they have vastly different prices per ounce. How do you explain that?

&gt; 3 and 4. Fashionable items and Starbucks coffee is a hard one. Of course there's a lot of marketing needed, and thus labour, to make people believe their product is superior. But I personally don't think you could say this commodity fetishism is explained completely by the Labour theory of value. I see it as one of these instances were human fickleness causes some small disruptions in an otherwise perfect theory to explain economic reality.

true,timoleon,FRNK,Franken,"&gt;PETA spricht sich für ein Verbot der Jagd aus, weil das allgegenwärtige Massaker in deutschen Wäldern nichts mit Tier- oder Waldschutz zu tun hat.

Nachdem Raubtiere wie Wolf und Bär in Deutschland ausgerottet sind,  würden ohne die Bejagung durch den Menschen Rotwild, Rehe, Wildschweine u.v.a. Tierarten mehr überhand nehmen und noch mehr Schäden anrichten  als sie es ohnehin schon tun.

Die Jägerschaft mit ihrem Geweihfetischismus und ""die Natur braucht uns""-Dünkel hat durch ihr Tun die Jagd unentbehrlich gemacht. 

&gt;Die in vielen Landstrichen übliche Winterfütterung widerspricht diesem Argument und legt die wahren Absichten der Jäger offen, möglichst viele Abschüsse praktizieren zu können. Namhafte Biologen haben zudem längst nachgewiesen, dass waldbewohnende Tierpopulationen auch zu Zeiten von Wolf und Bär hauptsächlich durch Umwelteinflüsse wie Witterung, Nahrungsverfügbarkeit oder Krankheiten reguliert wurden.“

Ob die Jagd auch ökologisch und forstwirtschaftlich sinnvoll betrieben wird ist eine andere Frage. 

Nachdem es in Deutschland keine nennenswerten naturbelassenen Wälder mehr gibt, und durch Land- bzw. Forstwirtschaft viele Tierarten Futter genug finden, muss man eine wirksame Selbstregulierung der Wildbestände bezweifeln. 

In Berlin z.B. kommen Wildschweine in die Stadt, fressen aus Mülltonnen, und wühlen in Gärten und Parks nach Blumenzwiebeln.  ",0,1345917102,null,0,1345931957,0,c5ymigd,t3_yt25b,t1_c5ymigd,t3_yt25b,null,1429733542,2,false,de,t5_22i0,2

Der Artikel von Jasper von Altenbockum richtet sich in erster Linie gegen die nachträgliche Vereinnahmung der Vorfälle von Rostock durch die politische Linke und stellt in zweiter Instanz eine Kritik an der Asylpolitik der frühen 1990er Jahre dar. 

Er relativiert weder die Unmenschlichkeit der Vorfälle noch entlastet er die Schuldigen. Er stellt sie in einen größeren Kontext, er kritisiert dabei völlig zurecht die utopischen Vorstellungen mancher Leute darüber, wie Asylpolitik aussehen sollte und plädiert für eine maßvolle Politik, die beiderseitige Integration möglich macht (Siehe dazu den letzten Absatz).

Um dem ganzen noch eine persönliche Note zu geben: Er hat recht, die Asylpolitik Anfang der 1990er Jahre und auch Deutschland insgesamt (das haben die diversen Brandanschläge gezeigt) waren nicht auf das vorbereitet, was mit dem Ende des Ost-West-Konfliktes über das Land hereinbrach. Wer sich an die Flüchtlingsströme im Zuge der Kriege um Ex-Jugoslawien erinnert, der wird sich auch erinnern, dass die Zustände sowohl für die Flüchtlinge wie auch für die Anwohner zumindest unangenehm waren. Damit wir uns richtig verstehen, jeder wusste, dass diese Menschen Flüchtlinge waren und jeder von ihnen lieber ein friedliches Leben in seiner Heimat geführt hätte. Es wusste auch jeder, dass diese Menschen in ihre Heimat zurückgehen würden, sobald die Möglichkeit dazu bestand, aber eine Belastung war das ganze trotzdem. Das entschuldigt selbstverständlich keine Gewalt gegen Asylbewerber, aber es zeigt doch, dass es Grenzen der gesellschaftlichen Integrationsfähigkeit gibt (selbst wenn diese nur temporär von Nöten sein sollte) und der Traum des uneingeschränkten Multikulturalismus genau das ist, ein Traum.",0,1345922473,null,0,false,0,c5ynnu0,t3_ytaqn,t1_c5ynnu0,t3_ytaqn,null,1435688778,3,false,de,t5_22i0,3

Since the education they get affords them opportunities not available in the rural communities they come from. Only priests and doctors are likely to return to rural towns. 

So some ignorance is to be expected. 

The level ignorance however depends on the level of non-academic education including modern quasi-academic places of learning, how deeply class society is entrenched, level of social mobility and other factors. But again the more educated or less ignorant, which can be distinct properties, are to be found in major population centres.

Here's the reason (an example for Romania):

* the resources (e.g. oil: Austrian OMV, minerals, metal ores) are owned by westerners
* a lot of the land is owned by westerners (I read that in some counties of the west of the country, over half of the arable land is owned by Italians, laundering mafia money)
* much of the infrastructure (water distribution: Veolia, electricity distribution: ENEL Italy, gas distribution: Gaz de France, etc) is owned by westerners.
* all supermarket chains (without any exception) are western-owned: Mega Image (Delhaize Belgium), Kaufland (Germany), Carrefour (France), Lidl (Germany), etc.
* out of the top 100 Romanian companies, 98 are owned by foreigners.

How are we going to get developed when the profit money from all this is not invested back in the country? Much of it is taken to the country of the owners. 

You could say that we should build our own companies, but from what money? 

To compete with the cheap German imports you need a lot of capital. A third of the Romanian employees get the minimum wage of 160€/month. The median is 300€/month. That's barely enough to get by from one wage to the next.

true,buttluvin,UNSA,United States,"If you are looking for history, the East Side Gallery in Berlin was great along with all of the other historical pieces that go along with recent history.  The holocaust memorial is extremely touching.  If you have time, I suggest the Reichstag as well...everything about that tour was very informative and the building itself is an absolute jewel, IMO.  Also, the if you're in Berlin, you have to see the Brandenburg Gate.  Checkpoint Charlie was also something to see but I didn't really spend a whole lot of time there.  Too many people. Please keep in mind, I was only in Berlin for about 3 days...and it was NOT enough time at all.  Berlin is a very big city and there are many things to see.  

We partied one night near Brunnenstraße and Bernauerstraße (rough estimate).  Either way, that area are was great.  Packed with a lot of trendy bars and clubs.  All of us had a great time. 


In Munich:

* Englischer Gartens - It's a huge piece of land with trees, grass, water paths, some buildings/ restaurants, and the Chinesisch Turm, which is awesome for getting some beers, food and good times.  Every time we went by there, quite a few people were partying and having a great time. 

* Marienplatz - Get lost in that area.  Lots of bars, shops, great restaurants, and the square itself with the Rathaus is a beautiful sight.  Also, in that area, it's quite common to find many breweries loyal to the 6 original brews of Munich (lowenbrau, augustiner, hofbrau, paulaner, spaten, and hacker-pschorr). Try ALL of them. BUT, if you get your hands on a Tergensee...enjoy ever single drop of that delicious motherfucker. 

* If you have time to go right outside of Munich, check out Andechs abbey and/ or Ammersee if you want to go swimming or something. 

* Night clubs - My group and I fancied the likes of Atomic Cafe, Bullet, The Loft, Onyx, Backstage...yada yada.  We went to a lot of clubs and those were some of the names that stuck with me for whatever reasons.  Milchundbar was also cool but it was hard to get into...pretty trendy.  and it's more of a bar.

*  Museums -  Deutsches Museums (do it...go...for me).  I think I spent 3 days in that place, though.  it's huge.  BMW Museum was cool and if you can take the factory tour, that was pretty dope. Alte Pinakothek, Neue Pinakothek, and Pinakothek de Moderne are all in the same area and are very good.  Saw lots of famous paintings from all of the world class artists and the buildings are fantastic. Haus der Kunst was also a great stop.  Saw a pretty mind bending exhibit there.  Also, there is a small museum in LMU about Sophie Scholl and the White Rose.  Extremely moving.  

*  Olympiazentrum - The park itself is absolutely beautiful.  there is also a bar in the middle of the park/ entertainment area, which was fun.  kind of tiki bar-ish, ya know?

*  And if you're in the south, you really should try and take a trip to the alps.  Zugspitze is breathtaking.  Also, you could do Neuschwanstein and/ or the kehlsteinhaus.  The scenery that comes along with these places is sex on the eyes.  

I'm sorry for being so vague and I certainly can't name everything but i think this is a good start!  I stayed in Munich for 3 months and found something new everyday.  I don't think I will ever love another city as much.  Except, maybe Prague...fuckin' Prague, man.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; I understand the theory. It's wrong. Except for Marxists, every economic school agrees with me. The reason why Marxists like the LTV is that it supports their ideological claims that capitalists are exploiting the workers.

I don't think you do understand the theory, because you give me silly examples that are supposed to disprove it. Secondly, all economic science is ideological. And unsurprisingly it was Marx who introduced the theory of ideological nature of science. So the only difference between Marxists and the other schools is that we are conscious of the possible ideological nature of our work. Thirdly, most Marxian economists argue that Marx' political ideology (mainly his revolutionary socialism) can be seen seperate from his sociological and economical theory. I agree with them, while at the same time being Marxist in the political sense.

And only the Austrian school is so cocky to assume the Labour theory of Value has been debunked.  Most other heterodox schools leave that question open.

&gt; No, the marginal theory of value is the complete opposite of the LTV. In the marginalist approach value flows from the consumer to the labour: Something is worth doing because the result is valued. In the LTV it's the other way around: Something is valued because someone put work into it. Those two are diametrically opposed.

If you mean that only demand is seen as the determining factor of value than they are indeed opposed.

But it doesn't matter whether demand goes from consumer to producer or from producer to consumer, and in reality it is of course both. The value determining particle is still labour.

&gt; Of course art is a commodity. You can trade in paintings, for example. And if you insist that it isn't a commodity, then you have to explain where the value of non-commodities comes from.

High art is not a commodity because a commodity needs to be an equivalent to others of its kind. Like two barrels of oil. It's also impossible to recreate. Well, I can make a copy, but people would not see it as equivalent. So it is completely outside capitalist society, and thus outside the LTV. It's price is then imaginary, determined by beauty, rarity, personal considerations, status, etc... That imaginary price will however be always linked with prices of commodities, who are determined by labour.

&gt; Mining for gold and silver takes about the same amount of work. Yet they have vastly different prices per ounce. How do you explain that?

Gold is rare, so there's more labour needed to get the same amount.

&gt; So, reality doesn't follow your theory and that's realities fault? No, the theory obviously doesn't explain value correctly.

It explains a field of reality, a part of it. Instead of explaining nothing at all.

Let me give you a silly example. Let's say I invent a machine that can make diamonds indistinguishable from these that are mined. The price of diamonds will drop to the price of pencils. STV would say, the prices dropped because supply rose. But we all know labour saving technology was the determining factor.

STV is simply at the wrong side of the question. It doesn't explain reality, it explains surface phenomenons (simple supply demand) without understanding the reason for them. STV tries to explain the waves, but only the labour theory of value can explain the ocean.",0,1345972754,null,0,false,0,c5yxd0t,t3_yf7a9,t1_c5yxd0t,t1_c5ymhim,null,1429738732,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

There *has* to be a solution. Although I was also referring to the massive levels of corruption that Romania has, having lived with a guy from the country for a good while and talked with him a lot, Romania is nothing like what I consider to be acceptable in an EU country.

But yeah, there must be some way of sorting out the Roma gypsy problem, and as far as the EU is concerned a short term solution would have been simply not giving 600,000 more of them EU citizenship.

&gt;Now I'm not saying to take them and take care of them as your own. No.

Well that's basically what's happened because we're rich and Brits will still give money to a begging child because I think hearts haven't yet been turned to stone, which will inevitably happen more and more as gypsies exploit their children to beg and people realise what's happening.

Frankly, I think not allowing in Romania purely for the reason that we could have avoided have the Roma gypsies flooding over here would have been worth it, but the levels of corruption in Romania act as a very good secondary reason that Romania shouldn't have been allowed into the EU when it was. In the future? Damn right.

&gt;They don't solve it, they just take all of them and send them back. You just got a taste on how hard it is to deal with them.

We have minorities, we have some that integrate and some that don't, I don't see why there's this attitude of ""well you don't want to deal with them either"" - of course we don't, but they're not our bloody minority group, and we've got enough integration problems without voluntarily adopting more, which we never should have done.

&gt;The only thing that seems to work is: leaving them alone. Just let them be, and they stop causing so much trouble.

Yes, it is. Sadly, people are used to it, and it's kind of a like a shadow private medical system, which is the worst from both systems (worst because you have to pay and you don't get to have contracts, guarantees and all the benefits of a written and signed deal). The other sad truth is that medical staff and doctors are really poorly paid. I have plenty of friends in the system that are honest, but they often have other people supporting them or some extra job, because it's simply too hard otherwise. The Romanian governments refuse to allocate more money to the system, probably because it's harder to skim from it. You can check the stats on % invested compared to other countries. My personal opinion is that there's an interest in having the medical system become so shitty that people will accept the line that it should be dismantled and sold off.

I didn't say immigration is responsible for violence. I actually believe policies and the French population's initial reaction to immigration is what triggered the nasty spin we're in and led to violence in/from the suburbs (so to speak). That's the debate I want to be open in France; I want people to take their responsibilities and this mess fixed. Before we get there, I believe we need to clearly establish violence in/from the suburbs as a fact (certainly not to point fingers) and then we'll be able to look at our immigration policy (I'm especially targeting urbanization which has been akin to ""gethoistation"") and take steps toward a good living together and equality.

Is there there an awful lot of violence in the suburbs? Yes, only a fool would deny it. Am I blaming immigrants? No.

true,_sik,FINL,Finland,"Well those are stereotypes or generalisations (that are mostly positive), not examples of positive discrimination. If I gave ethnic minority students extra points for their university application, or if I saw a black and a white person being rude in public and only complained to the white person, that would be positive discrimination.

To me it's frustrating how racial differences almost always get conflated with racism, so I'll go through your examples a bit more, for the benefit of the general public.

Your examples are a mixed bag, because for some of them there is hard data, e.g. on the superiority of black runners, and on Jewish financial success. Pointing those out can hardly be racist unless one defines racism as admitting that racial/ethnic differences exist. There is also data on how Asians and whites have slightly different strengths in IQ tests, but it's not straightforward enough to really say anything (IIRC Asians were a bit better at spatial visualisation and whites at logic). The penis story is probably the dodgiest out of all those, because there are so many poorly conducted studies on penis length, and the myth gets perpetuated in popular culture (perhaps because it fits with some peoples' idea of what a black man is supposed to be?). Jonah Falcon has the world's largest penis, and he is a white guy. I remember reading that the next few after him are also white, which doesn't really fit with the popular perception of racial/ethnic penile length.

true,Boreras,NETH,The Netherlands,"&gt; It's not a fairy tale, the market regulates itself provided you can lose.

What you see now is companies having taken on risks that they incorrectly deemed safe. But the damage that these failures would cost society as a whole are much bigger than the damage caused to the companies themselves. Letting these companies go bankrupt would have incurred a higher cost to society. In economics this has a name: *[externality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality#Negative)* (the costs are *externalised* by the companies). In laissez-faire capitalism the free market fails to deal with offloading costs to society. What is the cause is not the bailouts but the costs of the risk to society companies took. Without regulations and Pigovian taxes (a way to pay for exteranlities), these costs are always incurred by society without consent and benefit.

An 'efficient' free market has a very strong incentive to abuse externalising costs. An important example is pollution. Society's health suffers because of this (among other things), but in a completely free market no one pays for the resulting reduction in production. The same with vaccinations, the health of surrounding people improves because of your resistance, but those benefits are spread thinly to society as a whole, not to you personally. So society helps pay for this *positive* externality, while it should increase taxes to internalise the costs of pollution and financial risks. With their risk, these companies already damaged society before they were bailed out, not afterwards, and they were not motivated to do so by possible bailouts. What the bailouts claim to do is limit the costs already incurred by society, hoping to prevent further blowup. Of course it is disputable if this cost-benefit analyses are as claimed, but I am not arguing that these bailouts are beneficial, rather: markets fail to self-regulate with or without bailouts, because they do not account for the risk they impose on society.

Since 'free markets' cannot, or rather would prefer not to, deal with externalised costs, self regulation is absolutely a fairy tale in any market that contains externalities, including the grim tale of financial markets' self-regulation. Pigouvian taxes are difficult to implement with financial markets, so there are regulations. (And no, the Coase theorem is mostly theoretical and has not been widely applied by these self-regulating markets since the required conditions are almost never met.)

\* Edit: another interesting exemplary externality is the Lehman Brothers. The nose dive the world economy took was a massive hit to the world's society, a costly risk offloaded to us all, without consent or bailout! This negative externality (risk of bankruptcy) on their financial dealings was never accounted for, in fact we're all still paying for their bets right now.

*Right-wing populism is a combination of ethno-nationalism with anti-elitist populist rhetoric and a radical critique of existing political institutions. According to Margaret Canovan, a right-wing populist is ""...a charismatic leader, using the tactics of politicians’ populism to go past the politicians and intellectual elite and appeal to the reactionary sentiments of the populace, often buttressing his claim to speak for the people by the use of referendums.""* 

[Link to what He said, again](http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2012/05/01/wilders-wil-dat-nederland-uit-europese-unie-stapt/)

*The far-right, (also known as the extreme right or radical right) refers to the highest degree of rightism in right-wing politics. Far right politics involves support of strong or complete social hierarchy in society, and supports supremacy of certain individuals or groups deemed to be innately superior who are to be more valued than those deemed to be innately inferior.*

And his anti-Islam policies are well known. He started the [IFA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Freedom_Alliance).

*Fascists seek elevation of their nation based on commitment to an organic national community where its individuals are united together as one people in national identity.*

This means it may take a while for your camera to turn up there. If the camera's not there, I would not give up in case it turns up in a week or so. 
So at this point maybe call the Taxi Companies, but definitely call the Comune too:  06 67693214 / 3217, or email them oggettismarriti&lt;at&gt;comune.roma.it .

Also, it says [here](http://www.060608.it/it/accoglienza/servizi/oggetti-smarriti/oggetti-smarriti-roma-capitale.html) that if the owner of the object can't be immediately determined (I suppose this is the case with your camera, since it doesn't have your name on it; I don't think that your pictures being in there will be enough unfortunately) you need to report the loss to the police with an accurate description of the object.

They are, I already demonstrated. The link I provided showed the average maximum tax rate for individuals, businesses and the VAT and Portugal was always above the average, of both the EU and the Eurozone.

Even in the link I posted it said the maximum rates were applied in Sweden, that's not what I'm arguing, what I'm arguing against is

&gt;Southern European governments wanted everyone to win in the short term:
&gt;
&gt;* the rich - by having low taxes 

which was what anarchisto said. In the link I posted it said that Portugal has the 8th highest tax on individuals, 4th on business and 5th on VAT. This is by no means low taxes.

&gt;I don't think they are

This isn't a matter of what you think, it's a matter of facts.

&gt;but if I am wrong, please provide he with a link to Eurostat.

I just proved it, if you really want to confirm the data published by a mainstream Portuguese newspaper, feel free to check yourself for data over at Eurostat. I'm sure it will just corroborate the data I already presented. I'm not going to do your work for you.

&gt;Also, as you pointed out, there is more corruption in Portugal than in Sweden, so I imagine that less people actually pay their taxes, which means more tax evaders.

That's hard to determine, I'm sure it's true but still, it's not an argument for increasing taxes even more here.

&gt;Also, I don't see where he said that higher taxes were the solution. 

He said the Nordic model was the solution. He said high taxes are part of the Nordic model and it wasn't what was being done here. I proved him wrong when he said we had low taxes and I argued against his solution that high taxes and increased public spending were the solution.
