I doubt that Greece would voluntarily leave the eurozone, the social costs would be massive and it is not clear that the other members would facilitate a simple exit as they would be left carrying the losses and that's the last thing Eurozone banks need is a massive writeoff of debt.

And if Greece could exit then who would be next? Probably most of Southern Europe and that leaves the EU in a right mess and about 20 years backwards. None of the political classes seem to be thinking beyond the next few months let alone years.

This was hardly a secret and one of the reasons how Greece and others were able to borrow at rates significantly below what they previously had.

Markets assuming that Germany is the lender of last resort is fairly new post-recession idea to explain why markets acted like they did. However this neglect the fact that German economy was weak at the time Euro was launched and remained so for a period time, also other economies in the peripheral countries grew at much faster pace and their state finances were in order. In Greece of course they weren't as markets were given false information by the Greek state.

The only danger that were talked at least in here was Euroarea countries having different economic cycles that could cause tremendous pressure to our economy if we would be caught in recession while other countries wouldn't. The remedy that was suggested then was to have a buffer fund for the rainy day, that was transformed to state actively decreasing state debt.

&gt; Even now there is little debate about how Europe can emerge from this crisis any stronger. It's mostly being dealt with technocratic governments being imposed and back room deals. Hardly the beacon of enlightenment and democracy many people hoped for.

Markets will find the balance eventually and the growth will return, that is the answer on how Europe will emerge from the recession. And in case of technocratic governments, they are legitimate as they have been democratically elected, parliamentary democracy doesn't require ministers to be elected politicians, they only require parliamentary oversight and control.

Also, it is next to Calle Elvira which is the main *tapas* hub in Granada: It's full of bars where you can get stuffed for just a couple of euros, though the quality is not the best. This is how it works: you just order something to drink and they will give you a plate with a hamburger, a sandwich or something like that. For free. That's how Granada's university students usually survive.

In Málaga you must eat some good fish (fried fish, mainly) in a *chiringuito* (waterfront restaurants, just over the sand in the beach). Almost any would do, but I would recommend [El Tintero](http://maps.google.es/maps/place?hl=es&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.,cf.osb&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=677&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=bodegas+casta%C3%B1eda&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=es&amp;hq=bodegas+casta%C3%B1eda&amp;hnear=bodegas+casta%C3%B1eda&amp;cid=14187262505039596318) for the fun value: This is not a normal restaurant where you just order, here, waiters wander around the table with trays full of dishes yelling their wares and you stop them and tell them to leave one on your table. When it's pay time, they just count the dishes on your table, so people tend to bury the plates under the sand to pay less (but that's just us!). Roughly 7 Euro/plate, so it's pretty cheap and the quality is good.

true,atheistmil,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; Markets assuming that Germany is the lender of last resort is fairly new post-recession idea to explain why markets acted like they did. 

It really isn't. It has been a base assumption since the start. Look at the debt spreads of Greek debt over German debt. There was no way that that would have been sustainable without the implicit support of Germany. Many commentators have even stated as much over the years.

&gt; The only danger that were talked at least in here was Euroarea countries having different economic cycles that could cause tremendous pressure to our economy if we would be caught in recession while other countries wouldn't. The remedy that was suggested then was to have a buffer fund for the rainy day, that was transformed to state actively decreasing state debt.

What happened to that buffer fund? It must have passed me by.

Now, I don't wish to get all patronising but if you and/or your media could find no fault with the EU as proposed at the time then one of you is doing a bad job. No plan, certainly nothing involving politicians should ever be assumed to be ""so simple"". 

Similarly now, why are the plans and proposals being put to greater scrutiny? Any negativity is swiftly put down. The EU needs to answer its critics not just drown them out and claim they are ""evil"" eurosceptics. 

The EU increasingly feels like a autocratic farce.

&gt; Markets will find the balance eventually and the growth will return, that is the answer on how Europe will emerge from the recession.

Time is money and every second counts. It is better to hash something out and then execute it and then look on what the situation is and what needs to be done next.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I used to live 2 years in the Nice area. I recommend you to visit the towns near Nice. 

Nice is really cool itself. Has a nice beach and is a really nice city. The city centre is amazing and there are alot of nice art things going on. Go to the city centre at night and youll see a lot of street performers and things.

However, the real nice thing in the area is that there are so many nice towns in a close perimeter.

Outside of Nice you should definitely visit-

- Cannes- Theres a really good nightlife there and you should definitely visit here to see the Croissette and the Palais des festivales where the festival de Cannes is held. Some really nice beaches here, I recommend you to go to public ones if you dont want to pay too much. Nightlife is really good here but is expensive (Palais, Gotha, Lapart..). If youre ready to splash out, all the big US artists go there and perform over summer (last year there was Rick Ross, Deadmaus, LMFAO, Fat Joe amongst others) You can go to bars which would be more affordable. Full of English speaking people

- Antibes. This is where Im from. You should visit the old Antibes. Its basically a port where all the boats and yachts dock. Its full of English speakers (English, Australians, South Africans etc) and there are loads of good pubs. The hopstore is the one I would go with all my friends. Its really fun during summer especially. 

- Juan les Pins- This is like a 20 minute walk from Antibes center. Here there are nice clubs and bars and it has the advantage of being cheaper than Cannes. The 2 main clubs are "" le Village"" which is basically a pretty trashy french club. However, its good fun to get wasted there and meet people. Then there's (I cant remember the name, the old name used to be Milk). Which is a much better club. I recommend you to go there. Go to one of the bars around first. Further down there are loads of beaches at Golf Juan during the day you should go to

- Monaco- is like a 1 hour drive. You should definitely go there just to visit. Pretty impressive. Just take like a few drinks there cus its really expensive aswell

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This are all urban areas, you should also try to visit nature and smalle towns.

- Italy (Ventimiglia) - Is not far away at all. Like 1 1/2 hours. This town is very beautiful and I recomend you to visit it aswell. Very local and old fashioned.

- Grasse is known for its perfumes and you can visit the perfumerie. Personally I dont find it interesting but it is a usual spot for tourists

- Gorges du loup- This is basically a waterfall. You can go canyoning/white water rafting (is that how to saw it?) Its really beautiful and enjoyable. I definitely recomend. There is also a parcure aventure where you go on cable lines for several meters over a beautiful view. I recomend you to try to do that aswell.

- The small beautiful towns, you should definitely try to visit them. Vence, Tourrettes sur Loup etc. They are very authentic and very old fashioned French. This is an image of Tourrettes sur Loup for example- http://a10.idata.over-blog.com/0/49/46/56/articles-2009-bis/004.jpg

- Theoul.  I used to go there with friends to go cliff jumping. The place is beautiful and you should atleast come there just for the view. Aprox 30 minutes away from Nice.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Basically what I recomend you to do is to take your car and dont do the mistake of just staying in Nice. Nice is really nice but there is not such an incredibly large amount of things to do. Basically the rule in the Cote Dazur area is that the coastal towns are urban. The ones with the most activities are Monaco, Nice, Cannes, and Antibes. Each has their distinct differences but try to visit them. The interior is not very urban, but is very beautiful and much more authentic. For me its better for visisting to get a taste of real France. Try to get a GPS cus its hard to travel in the interior.

true,atheistmil,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; The problem is when the EU is moving, it has current realities that always hinder its development. Yes, you can imagine many problems that can come out, but then again there are costs and risk involved on not going further. Thus some things aren't on the table.

The phrase ""fools rush in where angels fear to tread"" springs to mind. The risks are poorly understood or quantified and certainly not communicated. 

Furthermore, the solution is always ""more Europe"" never less, or a pause for thought or reflection. Yes, some things require speed and a fast reaction but many of the treaties are fleshed out over years if not decades. 

And when these rash decisions are made, like we have seen recently, who holds the EU to account?

&gt; It is better to hash something out and then execute it and then look on what the situation is and what needs to be done next. 

In that sentence you've summed up pretty much everything that is wrong in the world. That fire-fighting behaviour is evidence of piss poor management. 

Politicians should be shaping the landscape not reacting to it in that way. Yes, earthquakes and what not will require a reaction but those types of reaction should be well considered and rehearsed. 

&gt; For example the problems that Greece has had have only become bigger as more time has passed, much due to there being more visibility to highlight them.

I disagree, the problems Greece has had have been plain to see. They became *bigger* because consequences to the actions taken became reality rather than a percentage risk on a spreadsheet.

&gt; Also the EU isn't becoming more protectionist, what it is doing is starting to use its force to open foreign markets that are much more closed from foreign entities than the European single market.

After students graduate from there, they have the option of either entering the work force or going to graduate school, which offers more specialized education for various fields.  For example, students wanting to practice medicine must go through a medical graduate program and later a doctoral program.  Others, like those in the social sciences or humanities can go to graduate school in order to become more educated about a specific topic (e.g. Studying German churches in the 20th century, the Meiji Restoration in Japan, psychoanalytical studies, etc.).  It is becoming more common in the US for students to have to go to graduate school if they want a good (paying) job later on in life.  

As for ""fitting a high school properly into our system,"" that is a matter of perspective.  To many Americans, the idea of having more than one type of ""high school"" is difficult to comprehend and some would even ask why there needed to be different types of schools.

The problem, in my opinion, is that they are not yet mature as a movement. They give off the impression, to a certain extent fairly to a certain extent not, that they are simply in favour of getting stuff for free. They need to find a new balance between rewarding success and allowing the free flow of information, rather than just throwing the baby out with the bath water.

What you say about the systems not fitting is true to some extent.

As I said, the German system is very well comparable to the British one and in the UK, a college is between a university and the secondary school. The ""Oberstufe"" can be done on a college but you can also do a ""Fachabitur"", which is the same without a second foreign language and more focused on the practical use, on a college which make ""Oberstufe"" not the same as college (and again. This shows very well that the systems are too different to give a proper comparison).

I've got no idea what you're going to say. ""Masterstudium"" or ""Doktorstudium"" says what you're doing and not where. Since we have no comparable school like a graduate-school, you cannot translate this. You've got to use the American terms if it is important to say where you're doing something. Saying ""I'm doing my Master"" doesn't tell people where you're doing it. You can be in a university as well as on a university of applied science (which is the university for people with ""Fachabitur""). Same counts for the PhD, there are a few universities of applied science where you can make your PhD.

Saying what you're doing is worthless. You've got to tell people where you're doing what and if that doesn't work in German, you've got to tell people what the American term means.

Ich machte meinen M.Sc. auf einer graduate-school, welche eine Universität für Master- und Doktorstudiengänge ist, im Jahr 2010.

Graduate-school can be in quotes. I prefer the dash (is the minus a dash if you're talking about languages?) for combined English nouns because it gives me the impression of ""one word"" like it would be in German. I wouldn't write it with capital letters, though. I think one should always respect the rules of other languages for a clear separation between the languages. 

Of course you can always say that you're continue studying. But no German would think that you're switching the university if you don't talk about it.

So there is no reason for feeling weird because it looks wrong for you (it is actually more common in the UK if I remember correctly) but you want to make it well readable for Germans. But you can also use the usual way and/or but it in quotes. No problem at all.

You have every right to think that the terms do not exist or the differences are too great.  And I will respect that.  n_n.  I just think that there are linguistic differences that first need to be overcome in order to understand the other language's understandings of words.  It is being able to shake off one's perspectives that is the difficult part, but after this, then explaining things will be a little easier.  

I will agree that English is a little messed up.  However, to clarify, a hyphen is a punctuation mark that can be used to combine otherwise not compound words in order to make them pseudo-compound words (like that).  It also is used to put prefixes on words as well as to show a line break in between syllables.  That is to say if when you are writing a paper and a whole word does not fit onto the end of the line, it is possible to break it in between a syllable with a hyphen and put the rest of the word on the next line.  However, a minus is a mathematical symbol with a different usage than a hyphen.  Therefore, it is not grammatically correct to interchange them.  And there are proper ways of using a hyphen (as compared to a dash), and official definitions, but they are often confusing and even many native English speakers get them wrong.  But as you put it, there needs to be respect for linguistic differences.  Therefore, when I say that it looks weird to me to have the hyphen, then there is a reason.  It is the same as ""Gratuiertenschule"" looking weird to you.  But putting it to German writing, I think that quotes would perhaps be the best middle ground for such terms.

I think it really depends on what you want to do where post-grad. For example I'm thinking about getting my masters in education also at the University of Barcelona, but I know that I will have a harder time getting a job here in the states (where I'm originally from) than a job in Spain after I graduate. So if you're planning to stay in Barcelona after graduating it might be easier than returning to Australia. But I'm not sure as I've never been to Australia and don't know what an international degree in Business Economics/Finance will get you back home.

As for transferring from one school to another, I think it just really depends on you. Have you ever been to Barcelona? Do you speak Spanish/Catalan? What made you choose Barcelona and what attracts you to the university? I would suggest visiting the campus to see if you like the school culture there. As for transferring, it may be difficult and challenging to work with the school to see what credit you already have will transfer over and (unfortunately) the credits that won't. But I recommend to get in touch with the school and if possible other students in your department to see what their experience is like.

Best of luck!

* A panel convened by the U.S. National Institutes of Health in 2007 determined that there was ""some concern"" about BPA's effects on fetal and infant brain development and behavior.

* A 2008 report by the U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP) later agreed with the panel, expressing ""some concern for effects on the brain, behavior, and prostate gland in fetuses, infants, and children at current human exposures to bisphenol A""

* A 2009 review of available studies has concluded that ""perinatal BPA exposure acts to exert persistent effects on body weight and adiposity"".

* In 2006, the US Government sponsored an assessment of the scientific literature on BPA. 38 experts on endocrine disrupters gathered in Chapel Hill, North Carolina to review several hundred studies on BPA. At the end of the meeting, the panel of experts came up with the Chapel Hill Consensus Statement, which stated “BPA at concentrations found in the human body is associated with organizational changes in the prostate, breast, testis, mammary glands, body size, brain structure and chemistry, and behavior of laboratory animals.”

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;It seems like the british have a closeted fetish for everything nazi, they just can't let go.

Yeah, I think it's because it was really the last time Britain had a big impact on the world and in doing the right thing by opposing Nazism, despite its support some of the aristocracy. And for a while it didn't look like we would succeed, until the US and Soviet Union also joined.

Whereas now we are just like a pawn of America (like almost every nation) meanwhile our resources and public services have been plundered by successive ""free-market"" governments, that have made the country pretty awful. For example, I worked in Germany last summer, and received two separate acceptances in Germany this summer (so I'll work there again) meanwhile in this country, skilled unemployment is pretty terrible and none of the universities have any funding to take on students for work outside of courses.

&gt;but comparing modern germany with the third reich? That shit just ain't funny.

As for comparing it to modern Germany, I think it's mostly just because we don't really learn anything about the anti-Nazi Germans, and the endless video games and war films don't do much to break the idea that ""German = Nazi"" at the time.

&gt;Also the constant retarded remarks regarding how our language sounds. That just doesn't roll.

Haha, again it's probably because most people have only heard German from Hitler's speeches here, or at least would only remember it as that. I don't think the sound is a problem, although I think the words are often more similar than they are in English due to the additional diphthongs , [but the grammar is a nightmare](http://www.crossmyt.com/hc/linghebr/awfgrmlg.html) in comparison with English.

&gt;That was strangely amazing! Not sure why I found it so entertaining.

In fact, I just remembered that [this is the most famous comedy sketch](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xnNhzgcWTk) which actually mocks the way the English act around Germans :P It was weird to watch Moran literally act like in the sketch, but seriously.

&gt;Oh, you're right about that. I was taught, as many others, that the United Kingdom consists of britain, wales, ireland, scotland, etc. I guess it's easy to make that mistake. Sorry about that ;)

Oh yeah, it's a common mistake for Americans too. Most British people won't mind, but in Ireland it'd be a very bad mistake!

* Venta [El túnel](http://www.ventaeltunel.com/). Just 5km outside of Málaga. Their specialty is[ chicken risotto \(cazuela de arroz\) with herbs](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3U64XpRFOts/Tw8x8ImjJ9I/AAAAAAAABt8/VDXVMFui0YQ/s1600/arroz.jpg). They usually will ask you if you want this dish when booking, and they will put the pot right on your table as soon as you sit down. Otherwise it's a 40min wait to enjoy this dish. It also famous for the [plato de los montes](http://fotos.diariosur.es/201101/plato-de-los-montes-imgp1812.jpg), marinated tenderloin, fried green pepper, fried chorizo, fried egg and french fries. Unlinke the rice, this dish is served pretty much in any Venta around Malaga.
* [Casa Pepa](http://www.pueblosdemalaga.com/casapepa.html). It's in the village of Carratraca. Again, really, really popular. A 3-course set-menu goes for 8€/pax, closed price, including drinks. You can eat all that you want, but it's not a buffet. The restaurant is just a townhouse, and [you sit in a sort of living room, surrounded by the 1st communion pictures of the children of the family, wedding pictures](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2726/4191482878_5dc81d82bc.jpg), it's not really that small because they use all the rooms in the house, including upper floor. Really special. They will take you order (usually 3-4 options per course) and the bring a whole pot / tray of each specialty to the table, and leave it there, so you can serve yourself as much as you want. In the unlikely event that you eat it all, they will insist in bringing another pot / tray. On sundays it's crowded, but it's very alive on weekdays too.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; More people have college degrees in the US than in Germany.

Actually, percentually more people _do_ have higher degrees in the US.  There's nothing better or worse with that, it's just different.  

The US has an educational system that is much more focused on people attending college, so the sheer density of universities and colleges, ranging from community colleges to massive private research universities is tremendous.  

Germany, by contrast, has a much more structured and mature system of apprenticeships and trade schools / Berufsschulen and their equivalents.  So a bank employee in the US would likely have a (probably unrelated) college degree, while a _Bankkaufmann_ in Germany will have a professional education and an _Abschlussprüfung_.

As a side rant from someone with both US and European degrees, attempts to standardize and compare between the two simply do not work - this is why Bologna was such a cockup, trying to shoehorn all European degrees into Bachelors/Masters categories.  In countries like the US, the ""value"" of your education is not just decided by its level, but what university you attended, and what field you studied, all done subjectively and on constantly shifting scales of comparison (note that I am purely talking about degrees without any context whatsoever, and I'm not saying it's fair or rational, just that it is what it is, before you get your panties in a bunch.)

So a 4-year degree from MIT would probably be considered as ""worth"" more by an employer than my liberal arts degree from a fairly Big Important Public School^tm .  My degree would probably be weighted more heavily than a similar one from small random party school.  A physics diploma would likely carry more weight than my international relations degree.  Etc.  Those distinctions don't exist so much between European institutions, so what they've done is just shoehorn all the ""Lizenziat"" and equivalents into ""Masters"" - thus giving value to many lesser American (and European) degrees and removing it from many more difficult, prestigious ones.

That said, that article is so chock full of rhetorical fallacies, bad writing, generalizations, and other crap that it makes me think it might as well have been written by some random no-nameo blogger with an axe to grind and a sad need for self-validation, rather than a reputable journali....oh, wait.

The ""you Americans are all..."" douchebaggery you get sometimes in Europe still exists, but it's far less prevalent than it was in the 1980s - and still far less so than ""lol France surrender ha ha"" and ""lol Germany how's ur Hitler?"" shit I see from stupid people in the US.'

true,luckystarr,null,null,"&gt; Wie darf man sich die Lernatmosphäre in der Vorlesung und die Art der Dozentin, auf Fragen zu antworten, konkret vorstellen?

&gt; Luisa Schwab: Der Lernstoff wurde, oft ohne Beispiele, an die Tafel geschrieben. Die Studierenden hatten daher Probleme mit dem Nachdenken und Verstehen hinterherzukommen und versuchten nur, alles Mögliche mitzuschreiben. Auf den Wunsch von Studierenden hin, den Stoff langsamer zu vermitteln, kamen von der Dozentin Reaktionen, wie zum Beispiel ""Hier wird gegessen und zu Hause wird verdaut"". Also, dass die Studierenden alles zu Hause nacharbeiten sollten, was nicht verstanden wurde.

Seit ich persönlich gute Erfahrungen mit neuartigen Lehrmethoden sammeln konnte, bin ich der Überzeugung dass es das beste wäre den Spieß einfach umzudrehen:

Lernende sollen sich den Stoff selbst beibringen (Für Beispiele dass das funktionieren kann siehe [Khan Academy](http://khanacademy.org) oder [Udacity](http://www.udacity.com)), und die Zeit, die für Vorlesungen verwendet wurde, soll stattdessen für Nachhilfe/Tutoring verwendet werden.

Das ist nicht nur menschlicher (direkterer Kontakt zur Lehrperson) sondern auch effizienter (langsamere Schüler sehen sich den Stoff einfach nochmal an).

Wie funktionierts? Im Prinzip wird eine Schulstunde/Vorlesung in kurze Videos zerstückelt welche ein neues Konzept vorstellen. Zwischen den Videos gibt es idealerweise kurze Quizze (via Web-Formularen) die es dem Schüler/Studenten ermöglichen sein Verständnis auf Plausibilität zu überprüfen. Wenn er beim Quiz einen Fehler machte, kann er nochmal zum Stoff zurückkehren und seinen Verständnisfehler suchen. Das ist schon allein aus der Gruppendynamik heraus absolut unmöglich in Situationen in denen 100 Studenten auf einen Dozenten treffen.",0,1334130999,null,0,true,0,c4awo7s,t3_s3oy7,t1_c4awo7s,t3_s3oy7,null,1428697709,5,false,de,t5_22i0,5

I used a recipe from a super cool book I bought titled Barcelona Gastronomy and Cuisine.  It was 10 euros at the Museum of Design's giftshop, but I've seen it in other stores. 

What you need (feeds 6)
300 g of desalted cod
200 g of flour
75 g of butter
2-3 eggs
3 cloves of garlic
a handful of parsley
olive oil
pepper
salt

1. Place cod in saucepan of water and heat it until it boils.  Remove from heat, drain the fish and crumble it.  Keep two spoonfuls of the dirty fish water.
2. In a mortar or bowl crush the garlic and parsley.   Once everything is crushed, mix in the cod.
3. This part is the tricky part.  Put the dirty fish water and butter in a saucepan.   When it melts add the flour all at once and stir until it unsticks from the sides.  Remove from heat and SLOWLY add beaten eggs.  I used two eggs because I didn't want it to be too runny.  
4. Mix the dough with stuff in the bowl and season lightly.  Make balls with a teaspoon and drop them into a frying pan with abundant hot oil until they are brown.  

For the measurements, I guesstimated.  I used a good amount of butter, a good amount of flour, etc. The recipe sounds difficult but isn't too bad.

And for a while it didn't look like we would succeed, until the US and Soviet Union also joined.

That's a good point. And I suppose it was also a good chance for brits to act as if the british line of kings, queen, princes and princesses wasn't made up almost entirely from german heritage ;-)

&gt; Whereas now we are just like a pawn of America (like almost every nation)

Unfortunately, that's true. I wish I could write something like ""but germany is actually still independent"" - it would be an outright lie if I did. 

&gt; For example, I worked in Germany last summer, and received two separate acceptances in Germany this summer (so I'll work there again) meanwhile in this country, skilled unemployment is pretty terrible and none of the universities have any funding to take on students for work outside of courses.

I'm sorry you had to go through this, but I'm glad to read you found your fortune in germany. It's by no means easy nowadays; With the EU crumbling, and all. :(

&gt; As for comparing it to modern Germany, I think it's mostly just because we don't really learn anything about the anti-Nazi Germans, and the endless video games and war films don't do much to break the idea that ""German = Nazi"" at the time.

That's also painfully true. Games like RTCW (Return To Castle Wolfenstein) pretty much make it look like there was zero resistance; Needless to say that's not the case.

That game was also very much glorifying the OSS, despite the OSS never really having done anything remotely like sending agents into the field... that would have been suicide.

&gt; Haha, again it's probably because most people have only heard German from Hitler's speeches here, or at least would only remember it as that. I don't think the sound is a problem, although I think the words are often more similar than they are in English due to the additional diphthongs

Indeed, and I think that where I'd say the general media is a little too easy going with their general conclusions. To me it's just the pinnacle of ignorance to say that a language sounds evil or angry; That goes for *all* languages. I heard the same shit from people about the korean, chinese or polish Language. Any linguist in this world would be facepalming hard at stuff like that.

&gt; [but the grammar is a nightmare](http://www.crossmyt.com/hc/linghebr/awfgrmlg.html) in comparison with English.

Love the book :-) Twain has a way with his words that you just can't find anywhere else. It also made me realize how easy I got it, already speaking german and all, and only having to learn english. Compared to all the other languages in europe, English can be literally taught in a matter of weeks.

&gt; In fact, I just remembered that [2] this is the most famous comedy sketch which actually mocks the way the English act around Germans :P It was weird to watch Moran literally act like in the sketch, but seriously.

Who doesn't love Faulty Towers? I've also loved ""And Now For Something Completely Different"" - The german version of the funniest joke in the world is just so wonderfully goofy.

I suspect the Court systems need to be reformed so that private contracts and the legitimate requirements of the state can be enforced.

The pensions system needs to be reformed.

The tax systems need to be reformed, simplified and enforced.

Enterprise needs to be encouraged, the tentacles of the state drawn in.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I would focus on learning vocabulary for the common situations you will find yourself in. For example, you will probably spend some time with your girlfriend's family in their home. If you don't know the words of the common household objects, put sticky notes on **everything** in your home. From toothpaste, to toilet paper, to a fork, to the names of the rooms. You will see the words everyday and they will stick (haha). I did it; it works.

For general vocabulary learning, don't try to learn more than 7 words at a time. Write the English word on the one side of card-stock (cue card) and the German word on the other. I do this and learn a little while taking the train. Or make a 'game of memory' with two different colours of paper; each colour representing a language. An important tip: You really should try to learn the article with every noun; it really helps in the future. **Edit:** If you *really* want to make sure you get those articles down, try the following: write all the nouns with the article 'die' on blue card-stock, all nouns with the article 'der' on green card-stock, and all nouns with the article 'das' on white card-stock. Or any colours which tickle your fancy ;)

Reading really helps you learn which nouns and verbs are often used together. You can try to find books like ['My First Reader'](http://www.dtv.de/buecher/first_reader_erste_englische_lesestuecke_9252.html) where one page is in German and the opposite page is in English. That also really helped me learn the past tense form of irregular verbs (though, knowing the past tense form of most verbs isn't important when it comes to speaking German.)

I must say though, memorizing vocabulary doesn't cut it if your goal is to speak. Your understanding of the language will be quite high, but articulating those words will be a whole other ball game. You should take lessons or find someone who would be willing to tandem with you (you teach a little English in exchange for learning a little German). For example, they teach you some basic German and you teach them English idioms or the finer points of the English language.

**Edit:** Here are some websites that I have used:

* [Beginner Level Worksheets](http://deutschdrang.com/BeginnerLevelWorksheets.aspx)
* [German Words and Phrases](http://www.elanguageschool.com/german/words-phrases)

People are not perfect and they are not perfectly wired biologically to stay together as couples during the time their children grow up. That's why marriage, or equivalents are a universal in all human societies.

We need cultural/societal pressure to accept the responsibilities that come with raising a family. That's why marriage exists. (Also, the issue of paternity, but lets not get into that.)

This is not a convenient thing, because we all would like to be free sometimes of all our burdens, but the thing is, some of these can not be just cast away when it is convenient. Even though this leads to (sometimes great amounts) of hurt, it seems to be necessary, because human nature is not perfect. (Whatever the definition of that would be.)

Personally, while I am in favor of deeper integration, I'm not entirely sure how it should be implemented, and at what speed (take, for example, the possibility of a German ""EU president"" if we were to introduce a real European constitution and a proper European head of state. How that would go down with Greek or UK voters, I have no idea). 

So instead of discussing right now whether we want to turn the EU into a federal superstate or whether we avoid complete unification, I believe we should first realize for a moment how damn lucky we are with what we have (and then those of us who think like that should probably start spreading the word among EU citizens). It's amazing that we live at a time where, no matter how grave the current economic situation might look, there is a) no real chance for war between European nations, and b) there is actually an honest desire by all of Europe to fix the situation. Yes, the latter point includes well-meaning but ineffective political decisions by less-than-perfect leaders, but before anybody starts ranting about ""German Nazi politicians"" or ""Lazy Greek tax evaders"", take a step back and compare our time to the Europe of, say, a hundred years ago when every crisis was essentially just an overture for the next big war, and the political agenda was best described as ""us vs. them"". 

We've come a long way since then, and I know I'm grateful for that.

true,Rarehero,EURO,European Union,"&gt;a way to keep two people bonded togetherforever to make children and raise them

In reality many married couples don't get children at all, nor do they stay together forever. I wonder if we shouldn't consider redefine the purpose of marriage since times have changed and many married people don't feel an obligation any more to get children and stay together. I think one problem is that for a very long time we had no alternative to marriage as a state of partnership, so it became the only institution to engage in a life long partnership.

So why not just talk about ""registered life long partnerships""? The governmant could accept a Christian marriage as one possible life long engagement, a ministerial marriage as another one and a registered partnership as yet another one and so on. All with the same governmental benefits and obligations. 

The pros:
- Religious marriage would become a religious institution again, and it be up to the Churches, how they deal with gay people in that respect.
- Gay people could engage in a ministerial marriage/life long engagement.
- The traditions of other religions could be respected as life long engagements as well, the freedom of religion would become stronger.
- Religious marriage (re)gain it's religious value.
- The division of government and religion would be further established since the government wouldn't divide between married and unmarried people any more.

The cons:
- Gay people, who are confident members of a Church, might not become married within their Church, which could be perceived an act of discrimination.

Don't get me wrong. I'm absolutely not anti-gay, and I'm an atheist. But I also think, that it's wrong to force a religion and it's members to do something what they think is wrong. There have to be limits of course. Arranged/forced marriage for example is forbidden in Germany. But while the unwillingness of many Christian churches to marry gay people has the potential to be an act of discrimination, I don't think that we should or have to protect their rights in that respect because the rights of religion and religious people are strong too (much stronger than the personal antipathy of a bus driver, who refuses to transport gay people for example) and because we could offer alternatives for gay people.

I think that the situation in Germany is not that bad, but it could be better though. We have religious marriage, we have civil marriage, and we have registered partnerships for gay people, as far as I know with the same benefits as for married people. Cancel registered partnerships, allow civil marriage for everyone, leave all kind of religious marriage to the respective religions and their members. The government should have no say about religious institutions (within the limits of the civil and human rights of course), religion should have no say about civil institutions. 

P.S.: Please don't argue with DNA. Marriage is a human invention, and it's just a convention, who we allow to become married and who not. Conventions can change, like it did concerning the role of women. 

P.S.S.: Please don't be too hard on me. I just try to find a solution that can satisfy all interests.

true,twoodfin,null,null,"&gt; Federated Europe is the only way for Europe to become a superpower. This will never happen due to cultural differences and vast income inequality between west and east.

How do you define ""superpower""? Traditionally, as applied to the U.S. and the U.S.S.R., it meant a nation with the military and economic resources to project its influence anywhere in the world. It's an open question, I suppose, whether a nation can achieve ""superpower"" status solely through economic means, but it seems unlikely to me. While it might proceed in fits and starts, globalization and liberalization of trade seem likely to continue: The very existence of an increasingly ""harmonized"" common market in Europe is evidence of that. Once everyone's trading with everyone else, it's difficult to impose your will through economic policy. Refuse to sell X or buy Y at global market prices through tariffs, etc. and you're only hurting your own producers or consumers and helping your strategic competitors who will be more than happy to make up the difference.

I suppose being the richest kid on the block and simply buying influence (the way the Chinese seem to be trying in Africa, say) might be one path to ""superpower"" status, but it's hard to see European politicians selling their constituents on the value of such spending (something the Chinese don't have to concern themselves with at the moment). And it'd be still more shocking if those politicians decided they had a popular mandate to invest in the kind of military capability necessary to project force worldwide without being utterly dependent on the U.S. (or, I suppose, someday the Chinese).

To pick a specific example: Viewed from across the Atlantic, there appears to be a strong consensus in Europe that serious action must be taken to avert catastrophic climate change. But how can Europe today, or even a larger, more economically and politically integrated Europe of tomorrow, push the Chinese and the Indians to take this action? Any attempt to impose a carbon tax on imports at Europe's borders would hurt European consumers as much as Chinese industrialists.

Not that the U.S., as a ""true"" superpower, has many more chips to play: Military alliances and a few Pacific carrier groups don't really help you influence Chinese economic and environmental policy. But that's sort of the point. The U.S. isn't particularly interested in having that kind of influence. It's happy to more or less use its military and economic predominance to maintain global peace and stability, with the occasional ""adventure"" when it feels its interests are threatened (Afghanistan) or when the politicians have convinced themselves that a little application of force now will reap greater benefits later (Iraq, Libya). It's unclear to me what role a ""superpower"" Europe would want to play, given the kind of influence a modern ""superpower"" can actually hope to have.

true,wishanem,UNSA,United States,"As an American it seems obvious to me that generalized US culture is homogeneous compared to European culture, but I wouldn't point to a common language as the source of that homogeneity. Firstly, one should consider the factor that Europe has twice as many people as the US! That’s a hell of a lot more room for diversity. 

IMO rather than identifying strongly with nationalistic cultures, Americans identify primarily with subcultures (which are often cross-regional and in fact international). Is this not also the case in Europe? Regardless, our generalized “American Culture” is homogeneous because it's a footnote in most of our lives. 

My parents, for instance, identify most strongly with conservative Christian Evangelical culture. They see themselves as Christians, farmers, homesteaders, and to a very small degree Americans. The subcultures which have grown around sports, videogames, cooking, pets, music, hunting, exercise, DIY, marijuana, theater, business, and sexuality all overshadow the culture of Americanism in the lives of everyone I know. 

Last week I was having a discussion with a friend who has no car, no bank account, and no TV. She lives with a folk/punk musician and a 60 year old peace activist. She enjoys live indie music, attending a banjo club every week, and volunteering at a church café for teenagers.

I think the structural imbalances are caused by three reasons: 

1. Technological know-how. 
2. Scale of operations. 
3. Geographical positioning and miscellaneous geopolitical issues. 

It's probably difficult for countries like Greece to compete on equal terms with countries like Germany and the like. Sums of money cannot really give you the technological know-how that was gained by centuries worth of industrialisation. In addition, Greece will almost certainly never be able to fund colossal mega-corporations that have the scale of operations that ING, Siemens, Bayer etc have. Finally, a geographical position may give a country a big advantage: For instance, take the Netherlands' position as a trade route or Norway's oil. It's hard to imagine that the comparative advantages and disadvantages of all countries in this respect could become completely balanced.

true,Joe2478,UNSA,United States,"The differences between European countries and American states are obviously much greater, but I personally think you're generalizing the cultural differences of Americans too much. Cutting it up into four geographic regions doesn't cut it. Tell the New York &amp; Boston areas, or New Orleans &amp; Houston, they're culturally the same, and see what they think of that. The thing I love about American culture is that it's made up from cultures around the world. I know it sounds cheesy, but we really are (or at least were at one time) a melting pot with ingredients from all over the world. 

If Europe became something like the US, I could see the countries viewing themselves in the same way individuals states do now. Everyone knows we're part of something bigger, together, but we also have pride in what's our own. I grew up in Virginia, close to the West Virginia border, and I saw it every day. You see it even more in cities/counties near the border of two (or more) states. I spent nearly a decade in the DC area as well, and the whole VA vs DC vs MD thing is constant.

Regardless of what happens in Europe politics wise, cultures are going to continue blending. The world is only going to keep getting smaller. Some will hold onto their heritage more than others, and some will just get stirred into the mix. I like to think that if we're still here, tens of thousands of years from now, the whole world will be one people and government. (If governments are even needed by then.)

I can see what you mean with regards to a replacement, the only major benefits in my opinion, are that it is easy to learn and has a strict written and spoken pronunciation, so it is much easier for international communication. You also have to remember that English isn't that widespread, it's still only about 20% of the population even by liberal estimates (a lot of that would be broken English), but indeed, the rise of English internationally has lessened the importance of Esperanto (remember it was created when France was the main language, especially in trade, but German was still big in science, and English was also used a lot, so there was not much international agreement on a dominant language).

&gt;Not to mention the fact that linguistic realities show us that, even if we did have one common language, it would diverge eventually and again turn into many dialects and later on into completely independent languages. The only way for this not to happen to Esperanto would require the language not to be used at all. If it's not used, it can't become dominant.

I think this is unlikely to happen now, because of the improvements in technology which mean communication is much more widespread. This greatly inhibits regional languages, when we probably hear more Americans on TV, and speak to as many foreign people as we do from our own community (especially now most people don't know their neighbours).

Premessa: se in questo Paese esiste una seria e reale minaccia alla celebre libertà di stampa, questa è la querelo-mania. Riconoscere che il problema è questo e proporsi di risolverlo, pertanto, è estremamente meritorio. Entrambe le idee cinque stelle, tuttavia, sono fallate.

* Depenalizzazione della querela - Potenzialmente dannosissima. Se io scrivo che tu sei una merda umana, incorro nella tua denuncia per diffamazione. Che può essere - la discrezione su come farla è tua - o penale o civile. Se si va nel penale, si va per la strada più seria: si fa il processo e se alla fine viene fuori che ti ho diffamato (il che, bada bene, non significa per forza che tu non debba essere una merda umana come io ho scritto: può anche essere vero che tu sei una merda umana, ma se io lo ho scritto in termini non obiettivi sono lo stesso condannabile) vado in galera. E siccome il penale è il modo più serio, non lo fa mai nessuno. Ti denunciano tutti col civile, ossia chiedendo un risarcimento danni smodato (ad abbassarlo poi ci penserà il giudice, quindi all'inizio chiunque ti spara una cifra tipo pil del Botswana, tanto sai che cazzo gli frega) e mettendo di fatto me e il mio editore sotto ricatto da qui a quando si va a sentenza. Depenalizzare la querela significa in qualche modo istituzionalizzare la denuncia civile, e pertanto piazzarla sonoramente nel culo ai giornalisti

* Importo depositato presso il tribunale in anticipo - Altra cosa che rischia di fare più danni dell'Aids. Uno dei pochi motivi per cui la gente continua a fare cose che sa essere a rischio di querela è che, almeno, da qui a quando, in caso di sconfitta in tribunale, materialmente dovrò iniziare a cacciare i soldi passano anni e per allora - come si dice - beato chi c'ha un occhio. Senza contare che il più delle volte a fare la querela sono politici, aziende o altri soggetti abbienti per cui versare questa specie di caparra è uno sforzo economico irrisorio.

true,back-in-black,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; IMO rather than identifying strongly with nationalistic cultures, Americans identify primarily with subcultures (which are often cross-regional and in fact international). Is this not also the case in Europe? Regardless, our generalized “American Culture” is homogeneous because it's a footnote in most of our lives.

Not really. But we have sub-cultures within our cultures. For example, a Scot may not primarily identify himself as British, or a Breton might not primarily think of himself as French. There are mutually unintelligible languages (belonging to separate cultures) *within* European nation states - Italy, Spain, and the UK, for example.  

Even within England there is a *big* division between Northern English and Southern English, and we haven't been separate countries since the Danelaw in the 9th century. The North has a set of very strong independent identities you could perhaps equate with Texas in the states (but without the religious nuttery). You can see it coming out in, say, ""Game of Thrones"", as whoever did the casting picked Northerners to play... well, Northerners. The English playing the Lanisters and the Targaryens are all from the South. 

If the EU ever gets as far as being a Federation, it will be a Federation of Federations on top of Unions of even older countries. 

As in the States, people still identify with a particular musical culture, or sexual culture, or what have you, but this is just *one* of their cultural identities, and not necessarily the one they would pick to describe themselves, or even the most important one. I guess it just seems more important to Americans because you have nothing much else separating you.

1) Capitalists could emigrate before new emigration tax law could be put into effect, and take much of their Capital with them.

2) Since changes would be so drastic, the opponents would likely push back with equal force - Thus making authoritarianism necessary if the new system is going to work.

3) wouldn't a long list of new taxes with a large minority opposition lead to a large number of people not paying taxes?

This is because it has little power relative to national parliaments. One of the reasons why integration has been so successful is because it has consisted almost entirely of ""low politics"" like economics, rather than ""high politics"" such as foreign policy and national security. National parliaments still have a fairly strong monopoly on high politics, and as such, they attract those who aspire for more power, prestige, and influence. As the European Parliament gains more and more power, this will begin to shift. It is actually quite interesting just how similar the development of some aspects of the EU have been to America's political development. From the inception of the Constitution until the end of the Civil War, state legislatures were generally considered to be more prestigious, and as such, Congress was generally used as a stepping stone for political aspirants.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Its really interesting you bring this up, because this is one of the points that differentiates the more (not sure how to describe it, Ill use libertarian for lack of a better word) ""libertarian"" left such as NPA (New Anti Capitalist party) and LO (Workers struggle) to the Front de Gauche which is Melanchon's party.

The candidates of the NPA are not professional politicians. They didnt go to big schools and dont wear suits. They are just oridnary workers. The candidate of the NPA is known to be really shy and laughs when journalists suggest he can win the election. They KNOW they are not going to win. Then why present themselves to the election you may ask.

Well for them the election is the best way for them to get their ideas known (without resorting to paramilitary like the Direct Action groups that Europe witnessed in the 70's). The NPA and LO DONT beleive in the current system. They DONT want to win the election. And they DONT beleive that just getting voted in will change things. What they want is for a new society. For them it is up to the PEOPLE to bring change, and thats what differentiates them with Melanchon who says HE will bring the change (as apart from that, their policies are very similar).

What the NPA and LO want is for people to realise they are being exploited and that they take ask for the current institutions to be brought down and replaced with new ones. As you say, installing a far left governmnet if it is not the overwhelming wish of the people will cause conflict which could encourage more authoritarianism. Thats why the NPA and LO wouldnt want to win the elections but instead encourage people (like them, remember they are represented by normal factory workers, and not professional politicians in suits like Melanchon) to take things into their own hands

--------------------------------------------------------------------

It is also very interesting and insightful if you look at the history of these parties. 

The Front de Gauche unites a bunch of leftist parties. The Communist Party is the biggest one historically part of it. And the history of the Communist Party in France is very authoritarian and bureaucratic. They used to be huge in France (the biggest party on their own infact and by far the biggest of the left, they would get around 25% of votes). They also followed a very similar line to Moscow during the times of the USSR. 

Then May 1968 happened in France in which huge numbers of students and workers went on strike and in the streets. Business were being run by workers. The president De Gaule had to flee to Germany. France was on the brink of a revolution. Hower, the Communist Party was against the revolution.

1. Moscow was scared of the outcomes of a Socialist France as they were unprepared for it. It would highten the conflict with the West

2. The ideology of the Communist Party did not fit that of the students who lead the revolution who were calling for sexual freedom, freedom to use drugs, environmentalism, a non paternalist society etc. Basically anarchist lite hippies. The Communist Party ideology was much closer to that of the bureaucratic and authoritarian USSR leadership. They dismissed the student protestors as Bourgeois who were being manipulated by De Gaule. They wanted to negotiate a truce with the French government which they did at the accords de Grenelle. The workers and students famously rejected the accords however.

So L.O and NPA are the remnants of the French revolutionaries who were angry that the very powerful Communist Party did not join their movement. LO represented the angry workers, and LCR (Revolutionary Communist League, later changed to NPA) represented the students and intellectuals (this is ofcourse somewhat exxagerated)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Heres my account on the differences between the Front de Gauche, and Lutte Ouvriere and the Nouveau Parti Anticapitaliste. As you rightly say, there could be conflict if someone like Melanchon was elected, which could push him to be more authoritarian.

true,kamins89,null,null,"Well, I don’t agree on agricultural subsidies. It is essentially a waste of money. First, a lot of money goes to unworthy projects, especially in case for new members (I’m originally from a new member and a lot of farmers are essentially scamming the system. Of course there are those who work hard and deserve the funds, but definitely not all). Second, if we look to output, if there’s overproduction, consumers benefit and producers have incentives to differentiate their products or improve efficiency in order to reduce price competition. Of course some will fail and leave the market allowing for greater consolidation. This can lead to greater specialization, which benefits all, producers and consumers. If there’s shortage supply is restricted we pay more and producers are not hurt. Third, it is highly unlikely that the whole region is adversely affected and supply, demand imbalances can be corrected through imports and high price jumps can only be temporary and overall unlikely. 

Although subsidies (at EU or local level) are inefficient, they’re unlikely to be scraped, because the producers will be against it, and politicians will not go against them in order to keep their support.
Market efficiency is debatable for financial sector, however markets work very well for other parts of economy, be it consumers goods or agriculture.

Also market fluctuations are often better than government intervention. This is due to availability and quality of information available for market participants, and incompetence of government (any government) to process it quickly in order to respond. As for financial sector, you need strong prudential regulations on banks and government spending. This, although slows growth of income, can significantly reduce the possibility of financial crises. 

Finally, it’s all my opinion, I might not know any better than any other chump :)

true,ctlaltdamn,null,null,"Automatic translation will never be a viable tool because one cannot automatically translate any of these in any satisfactory way:    
⋆ cultural references    
⋆ puns     
⋆ sarcasm     
⋆ accents (those used to convey out-of-band meanings to a phrase, not those used to tell words apart in accented languages)      
⋆ the ""y'know"", ""if you know what I mean"" parts

So far there have been 2 approaches to automatic translation, the dictionary-based one (which can only do the bland official language, devoid of any emotion, but cannot properly do it anyway) and the crowd-sourced one (Google translate) that tries to match/data-mine patterns, but that miserably fails on simple things like ""Prime Minister, Mr Xxx"" translating it to ""Prime Minister Yyyy"" where Y is the prime minister of the other country. Besides the crowd-sourced one doesn't always address the colloquialisms mentioned above either.        

The solution has been known for millenia already: use a ""lingua franca"".      
They just didn't all agree which one. For biology, it's latin (all dictionaries have it and it's THE way to look up translations for plants, animals, anatomy or even spices). For international mail it was French, but now it apparently is English. For the internet (and most computer work) it's obviously English.     
Conclusion: at home use **your own language** lest you lose that part of culture, then for any international interaction (real or virtual) learn English, it's the most used (and abused and misused) language anyway. (In some countries/regions you might need another regional ""lingua franca"" too, so you've got to be tri-lingual. Tough luck, get to it and learn. English is not going anywhere and neither are the regional languages. The only ones that could go away are the ones of smaller nations, but they shouldn't because **they're yours, they're your parents, they keep cultures alive**.

**TL;DR: learn your mother's tongue, the regional lingua franca (if any) and English. That's the de facto standard and it's not going anywhere.** (Well, if all 3 of these are English in your case, than for God's sake learn at least one other language.

Jokes aside, some simplistic answers (for more depth refer to the [internets] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_European_Union))

&gt; How does the government work? Is it like any other parliamentary democracy, or more like a republic?

None of the above. EU is actually governed by the European Commission  and the European Council which are formed by appointed and not elected people. The European Parliament which is the only democratically elected institution has limited power. 

&gt; With the government in place, how is the issue of sovereignty addressed?

That's complicated. Some things are controlled by each nation, some things are controlled by EU. The major thing that EU controls is the monetary policy. 

&gt;Does the EU have significant power over the individual states, or is it more like the UN, where actions are suggested, instead of forced?

So and so. Some actions are forced, some are suggested. Depends on the action and the decision. In most of the cases, if the country does not abide to some EU law, a fine is issued until the country decides to enforce that law. 

&gt;Has the EU planted a sense of unity amongst the nations? Are people more willing to work together, considering they're all under an agreed unifying system?

Difficult question to answer due to the problems inside the EU currently. We enjoy the fact that we can travel and work anywhere we want. I doubt that there is any serious sentiment of unity left since the recent developments. 

&gt;Lastly, I would like to know your opinions. What do you think about the EU? Has it done any good, or the opposite?

And here is were I will be downvoted to the depths of the Abyss. EU is formed in a totally wrong way. There is no real political unity. Only economical unity which works in favour of the North. The Leftists have been opposing EU for decades because of that and imo they are right. If we want a real union then we should for a union and not just a common marketplace.

I know there's a basic idea that the EU should not expand beyond Europe's traditional geographical borders, but I personally think it is vital to do so. A Europe which stops at the Bosporus and Gibraltar is an invitation for the rekindling of old conflicts between Christian Europe and the Islamic Middle East and Maghreb. We should be taking action to gentle the clash of civilizations, not exacerbate it.

And I think that Europe faces a similar challenge with the fall of autocratic regimes around the Mediterranean as it did 20 years ago with the breakup of the Eastern bloc, although clearly in many ways the situation is different.

Technology means never-ending progress. We Italians are now just buyers of technology. This deeply affects the attitude of people towards the future. We have stopped dreaming basically.

Last year I studied in Germany where I spent most of my time with a French girl (also a supporter of the NPA) She talked about politics a lot, and it was very interesting - particularly having so many parties.  I truly believe the 2 party system of the U.S. causes political indifference - I was indifferent to politics at the time - i didn't do anything but vote for democrats and criticize republicans 

 Yet It was my first time in another country that was not much poorer than the U.S. (besides Canada) and I was just blown away at how Germany was just ""better"" - a lot better - this caused me to be quite insecure about the U.S. and sensitive to criticisms. She didn't think too highly of U.S. of course - as she shouldn't.   Unfortunately I had fallen victim to the prejudice that Criticizing the U.S. is like the French version of baseball - or its the only way for the French to achieve their *joie de vivre* - So after a certain point we couldn't have interesting talks about politics without me feeling like she was saying terrible things about my mother. 

but I learned a lot and became very curious about many other things - especially about multiple parties - unfortunately tension arose at the mention of politics - so it was hard to have her settle my curiosity.

then I came back to Chicago - took a class on the concept of freedom, read some Marx - realized that she was right about a lot of things and apologized - now I try to pay attention to French election- especially far from center candidates.

I was not attracted to Melanchon.  Instead I am just very curious about the idea of multiple parties and what kind of freedoms and opportunities this allows politicians and voters alike.  I completely agree that if we are to move beyond capitalism it is up to the people.

I actually have another question on the topic if that's alright.  to what extent is 2002 syndrome a threat this election?

true,mojojo42,SCOT,Scotland,"The origins of the EU lie in preventing war - the organisation it came from was created in the 1950s to ""make war not only unthinkable, but materially impossible"" (if you're looking for a working class angle, working class men did much of the fighting and dying in pretty much every war in Europe over the past thousand years).

This was primarily between France and Germany, who have had several devastating wars over hundreds of years, and the idea was to bind economies together to make it counter-productive to go to war against a country who supplied you/you supplied with trade.

This has evolved into the idea of the ""internal market"" - this guarantees the free movement of goods, capital, services, and people within the EU. This lets an Italian manufacturer sell to a French retailer without much more bureaucracy than if he was selling internally. Similarly if you're not having much luck finding work in your home town, you can pick up and move to another country (almost) as easily as moving to another city in your own.

The best analogy would be if the relationship between California and Nevada was like the US and Argentina: if you wanted to go from A to B you'd need a visa and could be deported, if you wanted to sell goods you might need an export licence and would need to pay import taxes, if you wanted to invest in a business there you might need permission from your own government first, prior to the Euro you would need different currencies if you went to see friends/on vacation, etc.

The analogy isn't perfect, as countries within the EU have a much stronger self-identity than states in the US (who do have a self-identity, but identify much more as part of the US than European countries do with the EU). This is really just history though - most of the countries in Europe are 1000+ years old, the EU is 50 years old.

It has been fantastically successful at its initial goal (the idea that the UK would actually attack France is, for the first time in a long time, literally insane), however there is a tension between the idea of greater and closer union (essentially harmonising legislation between countries) and the idea of it being a partnership of individual nations.

true,Charming_Diplomat,EURO,European Union,"Well to be fair, Austria wasn't upset with joining their German brothers. With the conclusion of the First World War, Austria was totally dismembered from its former imperial territories. Austrians at the time had trouble identifying as to what it meant to be ""Austrian"" - most didn't consider it as an identity, and mainly considered themselves simply as German. And so, when 1919 was around, Austrians wanted to join the German Wiemar Republic, but it was under *duress* in a way, that the Treaty of Versailles dictated that a union of Germany and Austria was forbidden. The allies were not in the business of seeing their former enemy grow in strength, despite their clamors of championing ""self-deterministic"" slogans. Thus, the only time Germany could risk having Austria be part of it was when Germany was strong enough to resist the Allies and enforce it, there was no other way, even if it was democratically supported in Austria, if Germany had no military then, the Allies would of ended it, right there, right then. 

And this isn't something that has been democratically made, like you stated - Ireland voted to be made separate, yes, Yugoslavia broke up to do this also - but this never occurred to Austria in terms to Germany. It was always *forced* upon by external players, for better or for worse. 

As for Germany not getting greater influence, why? Germany is a bastion of democracy, freedom, justice, and diversity now.

Personally, the Austrians never fought against the notion of unification. Many Austrians joined the armed forces and partook in many things in Germany freely without complaint. The de-nazification of Austria was never total and complete, Austria was also given the status of being Hitler's first target of foreign aggression. This allowed the Austrians to try and portray themselves as victims and excuse themselves for some of their actions. Personally I find it more like an excuse to use, and it personally sickens me. I simply think of the lyrics of *Deutschland über Alles*, the lyrics themselves are not about the German chauvinist thinking that is often cited, the meaning to the lyrics, ""Germany, Germany above everything"" is based on the notion of national unification, that the various petty and self-interested princes should be less selfish and rise to the occasion and help facilitate and embrace national unification of all Germans.

true,drl33t,EURO,European Union,"- How does the government work? Is it like any other parliamentary democracy, or more like a republic?

One phrase that's tossed around a lot is ""unique entity"". The EU isn't really similar anything else. It started out as an unelected intergovernmental organization and has, throughout the decades since its inception after World War 2, morphed and adapted as Europe's leaders have tried to adapt to fix its flaws.

The EU parliamentary democratic in the sense the parliament elects the executive (European Commission), however unlike real parliamentary democracies it doesn't have the power to choose who they are. The Parliament also is organized among party lines, not national lines and operates very much like any typical national parliament.

By republic I assume you mean a presidential system, which this both is and isn't. There are no democratically elected individuals but there are a lot of separation of powers between institutions (on an EU-level as well as on a EU-to-national level). The European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers are like the President, House and the Senate - thats where most of the legal stuff's done. In addition we've got the European Council which operates like as if all 50 states' governors gathered every six months to decide how we should reshape and dictate where the entire union should go. Last but not least we've got the European Court of Justice which is like the Supreme Court except it's not allowed to overturn laws and only allowed to interpret cases on a per-case basis.

- With the government in place, how is the issue of sovereignty addressed?

It's sliced. It's like you take a strip of power from each nation and hand it over to the European Union, as mentioned by cybertroll monatery policy is definitely an example of where the EU has complete authority. Another is trade policy, competition rules for corporations, fishing, corporate policy. It's like as if when the American Founders setup the constitution they wrote exactly what the state governments and federal government is allowed to do or not to do, i.e. more of the stuff in interstate commerce and stripping states of their international relations' abilities. 

- Does the EU have significant power over the individual states, or is it more like the UN, where actions are suggested, instead of forced?

Forced. The EU is still an international body, and much like most international bodies there is no real 'enforcer' that can toss anyone into jail, but it is strongly implied that a country MUST implement and follow the rules simply based on norms and acceptance. De facto it's forced, but since, at the heart, the EU is still a union of sovereign states, it's *technically* and *physically* not forced. For example I don't think we'd have a civil war if one country wants to secede or refuse to comply with EU law. Delicate to explain…but that's how it works.

- Has the EU planted a sense of unity amongst the nations? Are people more willing to work together, considering they're all under an agreed unifying system?

It hasn't. Those who have a sense of unity are very small, I'd say. They tend to describe themselves as 'federalists', but they're far and few between. As there really is no European ethos yet. Most Europeans probably fall into the category of 'intergovernmentalists' who want a union but don't want a full-on federation. Then there's those who want it to only resemble a trade block, like NAFTA - mostly among the really big skeptics. After that there's those who just want it to be removed entirely (mostly communists/leftists and fascists/rightists).

- Lastly, I would like to know your opinions. What do you think about the EU? Has it done any good, or the opposite?

It has done a lot of good. I can't even imagine how it used to be before our countries were linked with one another: requiring visas, exchanging money, tariffs on everything, etc. Europe today has more freedom cross-boarder than what there used to be between American states 50 years ago (like the border controls for fruit?). Europe's changed a lot in these past decades and it keeps changing constantly. It's a work in progress and that's the beauty of it: nothing is set in stone. It's a continent where we've been waging war with one another for thousands of years and this is really the first point where we've NOT been slaughtering each other for an extended period of time.

I tend to believe the arc of history bends towards justice, so the European Union is (in my opinion) aptly described as a 'peace project'. The more we trade, the more we invest, the more we communicate and socialize with one another the more we prevent any new war from happening.

But it's always hard to judge and think in retrospect on something while it's occurring at this very moment. As I said, the beauty of the EU is that it's not set in stone - we constantly revaluate everything. But that also has the downside of risk and withdrawal and recession.

&gt; Yeah, I think in England it might also have a lot to do with all the comics and stuff being about the Nazis after the war. And then this influenced bands like David Bowie and Pink Floyd, etc. - we also had bigger problems with neo-nazism ironically with the National Front, etc. at the time.

I see your point, but I never thought Pink Floyd or David Bowie were much of a big deal (frankly, a lot of german bands sing about nazis as well, in a ""we hate nazis"" way though, so that's certainly not an issue). If it's all about resisting and fighting against nazism, I'm all for it, of course.

true,silverionmox,LIM2,Limburg,"&gt;First, a lot of money goes to unworthy projects, especially in case for new members (I’m originally from a new member and a lot of farmers are essentially scamming the system. Of course there are those who work hard and deserve the funds, but definitely not all).

I agree that the money isn't spent ideally. However, there are plenty of products sold on the markets too that aren't worth their price. More importantly, it doesn't matter: the goal is to reserve space and a production apparatus for agriculture, not to produce efficiently.

&gt; Second, if we look to output, if there’s overproduction, consumers benefit and producers have incentives to differentiate their products or improve efficiency in order to reduce price competition. Of course some will fail and leave the market allowing for greater consolidation. This can lead to greater specialization, which benefits all, producers and consumers. If there’s shortage supply is restricted we pay more and producers are not hurt.

The market is perfectly capable of handling small and gradual disruptions. However, if we didn't have agricultural subsidies, much more land would have been paved over and there wouldn't be much of a support industry for farmers. So if something happened to our food imports then, the market wouldn't be able to switch quickly back to home production: buying up houses and converting them to farmland is not trivial, not to mention the spatial inefficiency.

&gt;Third, it is highly unlikely that the whole region is adversely affected and supply, demand imbalances can be corrected through imports and high price jumps can only be temporary and overall unlikely.

The market is global. If food is scarce, it's scarce everywhere.

&gt;Although subsidies (at EU or local level) are inefficient, they’re unlikely to be scraped, because the producers will be against it, and politicians will not go against them in order to keep their support.

Farmers are not a big voter group. 1% in many countries to 15% at most.

&gt;Also market fluctuations are often better than government intervention. This is due to availability and quality of information available for market participants, and incompetence of government (any government) to process it quickly in order to respond

It's a long-term policy to maintain the land and the support industry of the agricultural sector. Reversing land use is very difficult.

2. Well I dont live in France (Im currently living in London) but I try to keep up to date on French news.  I watch french tv on the internet. I think the reason why I am so keen to follow French news is as you said; French politics has alot of plurality like Germany. I think these 2 countries have the most interesting political scenes in the world actually. But its true, not being in France often and not discussing with French people my age about current events does make me disconnected from the ""average"" person's opinion and only gives me a part of how things are. When Im done with university in London, I would like to live in France though.

3. Well my dad is French and my mother is Togolese but got French nationality by marrying my dad. I was born in Togo which was a former French colony and lived there till I was 7. Then I lived in Nigeria but we would go back to visit pretty often. We received a pretty French education at home. And we would go to France  at least once a year for vacations (Im in France right now for easter break). I did my highschool in a boarding shcool in England but got kicked out my final year (the shcool was very strict, I got caught drinking 1 too many times, everyone else drank too aswell), and because of that I had to live in France to redo my last 2 years of high school. So its actually luck that made me live in France, my other siblings never have.I have always been in English speaking schools even when I lived in France so . So I guess Im not the typical French person but retained links through my french education at home, links with the french community where we lived, going back to France often for vacations, living there for 2 years, and keeping up to date with news with the internet.

Local control over those parts of life is quite important, but a more positive way to look at things is that the EU is trying to set basic standards - it's not trying to ""take over"" anything.

For example we enjoy minimum standards for food, packaging, safety in the workplace, human rights, due process, etc which simply don't exist in many parts of the world.

From that viewpoint harmonising national standards is no bad thing: unifying legal systems would be a century-long project, but in the short term having basic standards for healthcare (a blood transfusion in Italy or Germany should be equally safe) or police cooperation (a criminal in France shouldn't be able to vanish simply by walking over to Spain) seem sensible.",0,1334225317,null,0,true,0,c4bchis,t3_s5qmf,t1_c4bchis,t1_c4bc7u3,null,1428705315,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

That is not the way national sovereignty works.  It is the reason why we signed Schengen, joined worthwhile programs like Erasmus, and the rest of what is called the ""bilateral treaties"" but did not join the EU.  Some of these are good, some are creatures of necessity, but it's a system that currently seems to work.

The EU would like to have a solid blue map, and they are welcome to try.  In the end, they may even succeed in having Switzerland join (successive governments, despite popular votes to the contrary, have refused to officially withdraw the currently ""frozen"" application for membership from Brussels, which I find astounding), but until the EU makes itself a lot more attractive and less broken, nothing short of full-on arm-twisting will bring Switzerland in as an actual member.

Sure, they can do that, and they'd probably succeed if they implemented embargoes and all sorts of other political fun, but do you really want a Europe that forces countries to join that do not want to?

There are many people in Europe who would like a strong, centralized ""United States of Europe"", with political integration as the main goal.

Others, like myself, would like to see a confederate, politically weak network of trade and movement treaties and standards, as a compromise between integration and national sovereignty.

The UK negotiated an ""opt out"" of certain payments to the rest of what is now the EU as a quid pro quo for allowing the French to keep supporting the hugely expensive CAP (common agricultural policy) and other subsidy / regulatory regimes.

There are also different ""power blocs"", if you will, within the EU - for example, in the early 2000s there was a split between parts of Eastern Europe and Western Europe (what Donald Rumsfeld unfortunately called ""old Europe"" vs. ""new Europe"") with some of the longer-standing members of the various European clubs at loggerheads with newer members.  That was largely aligned with the Franco-German closeness, which is now weaker as countries like Germany and the Netherlands tend to be economically more dominant and Italy takes a more active role again.  

My impression is that the UK, for better or worse, liked to see itself as a sort of balancing force in Europe, with the option to get out of all or parts of it, if those alliances and power blocs became too onerous.

As a side note, I distinctly get the feeling that the topic of what level of integration is ""right"" for Europe is a personally touchy subject for many subscribers.  I wonder why that is?",0,1334229856,null,0,false,0,c4bctdy,t3_s5qmf,t1_c4bctdy,t1_c4bcs0t,null,1428705471,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

*A sense of European identity traditionally derives from the idea of a common European historical narrative. In turn, that is assumed to be the source of the most fundamental European values. Typically the 'common history' includes a combination of Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome, the feudalism of the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, the Age of Enlightenment, 19th Century Liberalism, Christianity, secularism and (sometimes) negative elements such as colonialism and the World Wars.*

*The diversity of cultures within the framework of a common European civilization, the attachment to common values and principles, the increasing convergence of attitudes to life, the awareness of having specific interests in common and the determination to take part in the construction of a United Europe, all give the European Identity its originality and its own dynamism.*

Maybe these might not sound very real for some countries which have traditionally been more isolationist, neutral or simply too small to really take part at a significant level in some events but for some it is very real. Polls indeed show that support for a european identity can vary widely between countries (very high in Belgium or Poland, very low in Finland or the UK) and over time (used to be high in Netherlands and France, not so much recently).

[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland%E2%80%93European_Union_relations#Treaties)


&gt;The bilateral approach, as it is called in Switzerland, was consistently supported by the people in various referenda. It allows the Swiss to keep a sense of sovereignty, due to arrangements when changes in EU law will only apply after a joint bilateral commission decides so in consensus.

&gt;The commission can never discuss or change contents, i.e. unlike full EU members, Switzerland has no influence over the contents of EU law that will apply. And while the bilateral approach officially safeguards the right to refuse application of new EU law to Switzerland, in practice this right is severely restricted by the so-called Guillotine Clause, giving both parties a right to cancellation of the entire body of treaties when one new treaty or stipulation cannot be made applicable in Switzerland.

&gt;From the perspective of the EU, the treaties largely contain the same content as the EEA treaties, making Switzerland a virtual member of the EEA. Most EU law applies universally throughout the EU, the EEA and Switzerland, providing most of the conditions of the free movement of people, goods, services and capital that apply to full member states. Switzerland pays into the EU budget and extended the bilateral treaties to the new EU member states, just like full members did, yet people had to decide upon this in a referendum.

The EU likes to threaten with this, but it will not happen.

What discourages me is that the EU has not always negotiated in good faith - upon the adoption of Schengen, the Swiss were promised the option of deciding later whether to extend this to Bulgaria and Romania, and subsequently bullied into accepting it with the argument that it was never an option.  This has had the effect of significantly cutting down the willingness of Swiss voters to accept introduction of further EU rules.

That commission wikipedia refers to has never convened, so it's pointless to discuss whether or not it's realistically going to have any impact.  

And I don't quite see where the ""sense of sovereignty"" comes from - last I checked there was never any discussion of abrogating the full sovereignty of voters, for any reason, even if it contravened a treaty.  Thus far, voters have chosen to go along with it.  If someone pulled off an initiative, or won a high court case that contradicted EU rules, we'd just have to see what happens - since it's also never been the case, it is also not terribly productive to hypothesize about it.

For what it's worth, next to Germany Switzerland is one of the most stable economies in Europe right now.

*Now, here's my opinion:*

As an American, you should ask yourself what exactly forms the American bond that many feel so passionately for? American patriotism is what European patriotism could become. We have a rich history to be proud of and we have our symbols. Having the same language would help, but I think that Europe has enough experience in multilingualism to make up for it. America has a strong American identity that Europe lacks just like European states have strong identities that American states lack. I think, that makes federalism more difficult to implement. But the benefits are still there. Right now when Europe has a crisis, it takes years to sort things out. The United States (if it weren't for the dumb-ass House) could theoretically solve such problems in days.

Here's what I think would happen under a federation. I've lived in the United States for 12 years, so I get my ideas from there. Under a federation it would be as easy to move from Germany to Spain as it is to move from New York to Arizona. If certain things like the postal service were centralized, perhaps costs would go down for individual state governments. I don't think health insurance, primary education, or the police should be run by the federal government, because these services do not need to be more efficient. They need to be thorough, this is where our money should go. Universities are already very integrated, and perhaps if they were more integrated, quality would suffer. As a student, I feel that in Germany, Uni is okay. In the long run data would be easier to access when it is centralized, making government processes more efficient. The Space program might become something comparable to NASA if it got a strong national focus. The military would be leaner and more efficient. All in all maintenance costs would go down and state governments could attend to issues that involve the daily lives of the working class more efficiently. Waiting lines would probably get shorter and things wouldn't get lost as easily. Personally I think that anything that requires a local language should be provided by the states and anything that requires more computation and efficiency (basically any type of data/goods transfer or storage) should be run by the federal government. The United States works sort of on the same idea.",0,1334233749,null,0,false,0,c4bd78o,t3_s5qmf,t1_c4bd78o,t3_s5qmf,null,1428705661,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

true,Oda_Krell,EURO,"German, living in the Netherlands","I'm sorry if I gave the impression that I consider the ""fault"" of the creditors and the debtors the same. I do not. I would generally prefer to concentrate on what we have to do now, all of Europe, to solve things, but at some point, the question of who's fault the crisis was comes back, namely when we start to argue about moral responsibility to help others, and who has to suffer through hard times and to which extent.

And if it comes to this point, then, no, in no way is Germany or the Netherlands (or any other of the fiscally conservative countries) to blame to the same degree that Greece or Ireland. They are, largely, responsible for their own problems, because of an economic culture that went wrong a long time ago, and because of their decision to join the ECU. It is in everybody's (including the fiscally conservative countries) interest to help them to get out of this state, by providing them with funds, but let me be clear: I do not see them as equal partners, fiscally. 

Let me give an analogy that is non-economical: it would be as if Germany, immediately after WWII, would have demanded to be treated like any other peaceful nation, having a say in every decision regarding international politics, maybe a permanent seat in the UN Security Council. Guess what, Germany did not get that moral credit so shortly after the war. And even now, there's still some reservation towards Germany's commitment to peace (and I personally think that's understandable: cultural memory lasts longer than just a few years). Similarly, before the heavily indebted EU nations can demand the same (financial) respect as the others, they will first have to deliver. Simple as that.

Now a completely different question is how to address the crisis effectively. And at this point, I would definitely say the time for pure spending cuts and austerity measures is over. We need a large enough stimulus program, that together with structural reforms can create enough growth in the debtor countries for them to ""outgrow"" their debt.

Like I said, I would prefer not constantly going on about the question who is to blame, since that's the past, but if you force me to do so anyway, I would say bad economic decisions and postponed reforms in the debtor countries are to blame, together with a toxic environment created by a morally and ideologically laudable, but economically problematic currency union.

&gt;Sehr geehrte Frau Sadigh,

&gt;Sie haben in Ihrem Kommentar sehr starke Argumente genannt, die darlegen, dass es keine logische Rechtfertigung für ein Verbot geben kann.

&gt;Leider leben wir nicht in einer logischen Gesellschaft und die eigenen Moralvorstellungen werden von vielen wacker wie ein Schild vor sich hergetragen. Abweichende Meinungen sind dabei undenkbar und werden wahlweise mit Beleidigungen, Drohungen oder - schlimmstenfalls - durch Verleumdungen und Unterstellungen bekämpft.

&gt;Dies sieht man ja auch an an der Haltung der Richter. Ihr Argument mit der bewussten Vererbung von Behinderungen ist absolut zutreffend und hätte in diesem Kontext mit einfliessen müssen. Ferner gibt es überhaupt keinen medizinischen Grund mehr, wenn gar keine Kinder aus der Vereinigung hervorgehen aber das alleine ist ja bereits eine Straftat.

&gt;Die Schlussfolgerung ist daher, dass es hier nicht um logische und greifbare Argumente geht, sondern darum, dass Inzest dem moralischen Empfinden einer Gruppe zu wider steht.

&gt;Solange man selbst auf der Seite dieser Moral steht, ist das sehr angenehm aber wehe man steht auf der anderen, dann wird man schnell selbst zum Verfolgten. Genau daran sollten dann auch einige Menschen denken.

true,llehsadam,EURO,"Berlin, from Poland","I am speaking of population growth *somewhere else.* You aren't taking into account immigration from other parts of the world, both legal and illegal, which is bound to happen if life in Europe looks promising. This may not be a problem now, but surely will be a problem in the future, if you have a direct democracy. 

Suffrage is great, I agree. But in a direct democracy you do not vote for representative, you vote for issues that representatives would be there to solve. There are examples of limited direct democracy out there, but a fully direct democracy as defined, does not exist. Yes, some things like introducing bills or voting for president can be direct. 

What I stated as unsustainable was not having children, not suffrage. And by this I meant that we cannot control population growth. It controls us, and our politics. In order to have a sustainable direct democracy, population growth would have to be closely monitored and adjusted, possibly infringing on our liberties. I just don't think it's a good thing. We'll have mass scale groupthink and liberties will be crushed by national temperament trends.

It was quite general, but all I meant by the comparison of histories was that a Switzerland united by alliances and trade agreements went through a period of foreign invasions and civil war and came out as a federal republic. The reason as to why the French Invasion was rather peaceful was because of disfunctionality. Yes, the Swiss Confereacy had it's shiny moments (like any nation), but in the end (just like with Poland in 1795), Vaud persuaded France to come in and take over. It wasn't external pressure, the confederacy collapsed internally.

So taking this period as a metaphor, we can compare it to the disunity of Europe (although laced with alliances and agreements) before WWI. It's not a perfect comparison, but it's about the big picture which is that old motto ""United we stand, divided we fall"" or in another form ""One for all, all for one."" After a long period of turmoil in Switzerland (1798-1848) which is sort of like Europe from 1914 to 1945, some guys came up with a plan for a European Federation just like some guys came up with a new Swiss constitution that made the federal bond stronger than ever before. 

Going further with the metaphor, WWIII for Europe would be like WWI for Switzerland. I don't equate the lack of strong political integration with  I merely point out the inevitability of war, as shown by history. Strong political integration, if internally structured, withstands any war. If you have centralization in Europe that was created by the United States, it won't last. But if it the political integration is homegrown, it'll last and any war against will only strengthen the bond. The United States civil war is an example of a civil war that strengthened the Union and the Act of Union of 1800 in Great Britain is move towards greater union because of a foreign threat (France).

Yes, increased communications and trade play a large part, but for most of those 65 years Europe was divided by an iron curtain, with no communications or trade. War was always inevitable. I would say that trade and communication speed up the process but are not the reasons for it. The reason is fear of war, of an iron curtain, and of political dysfunction.

And see the goal is not to make your life easier, it's for you to make the loves of other's easier. This isn't the same thing because you don't have incentive to help others if you have a direct democracy. You don't want to let immigrants in, you don't want minorities, and you don't want to let them vote because minorities screw up direct democracies. You'll have a larger minority voting for the smaller minorities, with no majorities. Of course, you can fix this by forcing people to compromise, but compromise is easier if handled by a handful of representative rather than the populace itself. ""Politics is the continuation of war by other means"" and if it is the populace that acts as politician, instead of politics, you'll have civil strife.

Yes, maybe I have a bias, but so do you. Stating it is only good for the record, there is no way to remove it completely so we learn to deal with this. 

The case of modern Switzerland does not reflect the world stage as well as other countries. There are more modern ""doorstep"" countries than there are countries like Switzerland, and a lot of them are in Europe.
