Si tu veux, en attendant femen est le seul groupe dont la presse parle régulièrement ; nous sommes suivis par beaucoup de grands médias. On arrive enfin à amener les médias à parler de sujets importants comme le viol, les violences faites aux femmes, la discrimination etc etc. juste en montrant ses seins. Les seins ne sont pas une partie génitale, ce n'est que le regard de la société qui les rends obscène. Les hommes se mettent torse nu tout le temps.

Moi et beaucoup d'autres ont passés des années à manifester et essayer d'attirer l'attention sur de gros problèmes de société sans que personne ne s'y intéresse... Au passage j'étais à la manif contre le verdict de Créteil et absolument personne n'en a parlé. A peu près pareil pour la décoration des statuts avec des barbes que nous avons faite le 14 Juillet place de la Concorde avec La barbe ; et pourtant cette action était osé, originale, sans vandalisme et plutôt belle. Elles font de grosses actions, s'incrustent régulièrement dans des réunions de ministres ou autre, et personne n'en parle.

Les Femen sont passé le matin même et c'était partout. Au passage Inna était contre lorsqu'elles ont voulu faire seins nus en Ukraine la première fois, et puis une action a suffit à la convaincre. Sans parler du fait qu'on est dans l'ère de l'internet, il faut s'adapter à son public. Femen a fait la front page de reddit lors de la première action Française... Donc pour te répondre, c'est pour l'instant la seule façon d'intéresser les gens un minimum.

Très franchement non on ne s'attendait pas à ça, une bousculade oui, des insultes oui, une sécu un peu 'over-the-top', voir des hommes perdre toute inhibition et se transformer en Hulk, inconcevable ; et au passage ça fait plus de 8 ans que je fais du jiu-jitsu à un très haut niveau de ""réalisme"" face aux situations de violences extrêmes, je n'ai jamais vu telle violence.

Now, when we talk about legalization, we're not talking about letting hard drugs enter the free market. That would be really stupid, as letting most things enter the fre market is (but that's another story). This would have to be a highly controlled market by governmental agencies.

If it were legal, the illegal market wouldn't stand against governmental suppliers. Users would have to enter rehab programs in exchange for drug use which would take them out of drugs (this happens to this day in Portugal).

So by legalizing it you'd be able to reduce the number of dealers and users, and you'd get rid of product contamination.

Here's a clue:  There aren't many.   It's possible to overdose on heroin, but it's easier to suffer a fatal overdose of legal drugs like Aspirin.   There are major issues with impurities, but these are related to prohibition and it being cut with other shit that the dealers use to save money.    

Heroin isn't particularly dangerous in and of itself, other than it's addictive properties.   The major dangers come from junkies who have to steal to get their fix, pollutants in the drug, and the ongoing battle between dealers for turf.

Prohibition doesn't stop people from getting the drug, but it does put them in a considerably worse situation.   So think about that before dismissing potential solutions to the problem.

The point I was making was that generalizing is retarded; you completely missed it and somehow understood that I have a strong belief redheads are committing crime, but whatever...

Now I'm an atheist; I know a lot of atheists, christians, muslims and I can tell you one thing all of those communities have in common: They're full of assholes. Assholes who are ready to blame every other problem the communities they disagree with has on the fact that they are part of that group. An atheist terrorist kills 30 people? He lacks a sense of morality because he's atheist. A muslim dad kills his daughter because she's gay? The Qu'ran made him do it. Well, shit; turns out that crappy logic works both ways.

But hey, if instead of looking at someone's religion, you look at what else all those immigrants have in common, you start understanding the situation better. For example, why people from the middle east end up in scandinavia, why they fail to integrate, and oh, surprise, why failed integration results in crime. You know what all those evil immigrants have in common? They're from a country where the majority of people are muslims... and the  majority of people there are also black-haired and brown-skinned. **Blaming it on the religion makes as much sense as blaming it on the hair or skin color**.

In a situations where most people would back down and walk away, those who carry weapons don't do that and seek to stand up for themselves rather than be seen as weak.

That has been my experience having grown up in a shitty part of London. People carry knives on them and when they are at risk of losing a fight they bring it up. What would have been an embarrasing event turns into a very serious incident. One of my relatives for example got into an argument with an another guy in college. After classes they had a fight and my cousin beat him up. In an ordinary situation the loser would have walked away embarrassed or phoned his friends to beat my cousin up. In this case he had a knife on him and stabbed my cousin in the calf pretty badly. My cousin recovered from this injury but the guy who stabbed him ended up fucking his life over.

Growing up has a nerd in London. I've pretty much been beaten up and humilated many times. Thankfully I never carried a knife like a lot of kids did at that time, because if I did I know I would have used it on more than one occassion. I would be in jail now rather than in University.

France is just like everywhere else on earth; there are some jerks and some nice people.

Of course the French have stereotypes of Americans, that doesn't mean that they think ill of us, just like most Americans don't think ill of the French, though we of course have our stereotypes.

And no, i do not have to admit that, nor will i admit that, because it is completely false. There is *some* dislike of the US throughout the world. The US is also arguable the most ""famous"" country in the world. We have the largest media industry, and so we're very visible to the whole world. Compare that to the Netherlands. Ask someone in Yemen what they think of the Netherlands and they probably won't have much of an opinion. Ask them about the US and they probably will have some sort of an opinion, just because the US is so involved in the entire world. This means that while there are more people with ill feelings toward the US, it doesn't necessarily mean that, of the people that have an opinion on the US, there is a greater percentage that don't like the US.'

Do you see what i'm saying? Basically, no the rest of the world doesn't actually hate the US. There are some places that have more people that do, and some places that have fewer people that do. Most of these people, whether they like the US or not, have never even been here. It's all just stereotypes and the majority don't really care all that much where you're from as long as you're a decent human being to them.

It can cause mental health problems though, or exacerbate existing ones. It can also cause problems when you stop taking it ([PAWS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Acute_Withdrawal_Syndrome)). One of the ways you become addicted is that it makes it increasingly difficult to maintain normal levels of contentment/happiness/arousal when you're not taking it (anhedonia), and so you feel the need to take more. Tolerance and physical addiction come later.

I believe that legalisation would probably be the best approach.

Here's an answer, but you're not going to like it:

The witness in The Hague courtroom convincingly explained that the Serb rebellion in Croatia was, in fact, in the control of the top level of the Serbian government, detracting from the prosecution’s claims, especially regarding an “undefended” Krajina.  “The men in Krajina were not civilian men, because all the men were mobilized, and all were armed,” the witness recalled.

“In Krajina each residence had two weapons,” explained Lazarević, arguing that amongst the Serbs in Krajina during Operation Storm, the clearing and settlement of old accounts was not rare.

Krajina was based on the belief that Serbs cannot live with Croats, which is why the Krajina systematically expelled and killed Croats.  Whoever had a different opinion, in the Krajina was objectionable. For example, Dmitar Obradovic, the leader of Vrginmost, was assassinated by Serb forces, who later accused the Croatian side of the crime.

When it was clear that nothing will be able to stop the Croatian forces, the Serbian population already had been in the columns heading to Bosnia and Serbia, as they were all aware that in the Krajina there were no innocents and that they would, if they stayed, be overtaken by revenge.  “Everyone was to blame for something, no one could say that they had not done anything and, therefore, all had a reason to depart from Croatia”, said the witness.

The claim that we are too pc is one of the tricks they use, so they wont appear to be racist. If you were swedish you would know that politicians and every single media very often talks about immigration and integration. People talk about it, what problems there are and how to fix those problems, BUT they dont blame EVERYTHING on immigrants, and they also bring up other problems in Sweden, thats why sites like this claims that we are ""too pc"". They claim that you are labeled as a racist if you bring up immigration, but then why arent any of the other journalists and politicians called racist when they bring it up? Strange...

Sites like this works closely with a political party called ""sweden democrates"". They got about 6 % of the votes, and their history might give some insight.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden_Democrats

About a week ago their three top politicians, except the party leader, was shown in a clip late one night yelling racist slurs. A swedish commedian and muslim, was one target, and one of their politicians told him ""this is my country and with our politics there wont be any like you left in my country"". He responden ""but its my country as well"", but they again told him ""no, its not, its my country"". They also pushed a woman in to a car, called another woman a ""fucking whore"". They also yelled out ""babbe"" (racist slur)  and ""babbe lover"". They then go and pick up a bunch of leadpipes, but the police showes up. This is all on tape, they cant deny it. So how do people react to this, that their top politicians behaving this way? Imagine Joe Biden picking up a lead pipe and calling someone a ""nigger-lover"", who would defend that?

Well a lot of their voters online have defended them with ""they were just drunk"", and that its just ""left-wing PC media spinning the story"". You see it doesnt matter what they do, no matter how racist they are, there will always be those that pull the ""PC"" card, because thats all they have to hide behind.

This is of course a reaction that is mainly find online, but since these types of commentators are your only source it might be worth knowing.

true,eighth_acorn,null,null,"&gt;Where is your car? Wo ist diene Auto?

Close, it should be ""Wo is **dein** Auto?"", Auto is a das word, so in the akkusitive case you don't add anything to dein.

&gt;Do you have to potty? du hast Töpfchen?

In English we use ""have to"" and ""must"" interchangeably.  No such equivalence exists in German.  Also, by ""to potty"" in English you mean a verb, whereas ""Toepfchen"" is a noun, so what you've got right now basically means ""do you have a potty?"".  I can't find a verb that's a good approximation of ""to go potty"", so I'll just recommend ""Musst du auf die Toilette gehen?"" (""do you have to go to the toilet?"").

&gt;Do you want milk? ( or any other object ) Wollen du Milch?

In English we don't have very many different conjugations for most verbs (e.g. I want, you want, we want, they want).  In German, verbs have a different ending based on whether its I, you, he/she/it, we, you (plural), or they that is doing the verb.  Rather that rehash it myself I will refer you [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_conjugation).
In this case, you want to say ""Willst do Milch?""

On ""let's"": As I think back on my early days of German instruction the verb ""lassen"" and phrases like ""lass uns"" didn't come up much at all, but the usage is largely the same.

&gt;How should he say ""I want more"" or ""I want a car""
""Ich will mehr"" ""Ich will ein Auto""

We say ""I want ..."" in English a lot without realizing it, but in German saying ""Ich will"" is considered fairly rude.  It's a lot better to say ""Ich moechte"" (""I would like"") or to politely ask ""Koennte ich bitte .... haben"" (""Could I please have..."").  So for ""I want more (x)"", since I'm assuming you're talking about food here, I would go with ""Koennte ich ein bisschen mehr (x) haben bitte?"" (""Could I have a little more (x) please?"") or more informally ""Noch ein bisschen bitte?"" (""A little more please?"").  As an exception to the rule I just elaborated, since your little gentleman is clearly not seriously requesting that somebody give him a car, but stating a desire in the same way that he and I probably want to be Superman, saying ""Ich will ein Auto"" is a perfectly fine use of ""Ich will"".

Lastly, I would recommend this [wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_grammar#Verbs) as a grammar handbook and that you visit [Deutsche Welle](http://www.dw.de) for all sorts of things good for German learners, especially their [courses](http://www.dw.de/learn-german/german-courses/s-2547)- I took the pre-test and went through the course material from the level I tested into over a summer in high school and made was very satisfied with the return on my time investment.",0,1353306338,null,0,1353306576,0,c73koo6,t3_13etsj,t1_c73koo6,t3_13etsj,null,1430444289,4,false,GermanPractice,t5_2t7fs,4

In short, inflation-wise MMT sees printing bonds as little different to printing money, and that converting one to the other (or back) as the USA and Japan are doing is never going to be inflationary. That it doesn't matter how a government funds a deficit budget - by printing money, by printing bonds, or by spending savings - the inflationary impact would be much the same (and this can be demonstrated quite straightforwardly).

As such, recessions of this magnitude are simply unnecessary - provided you have a central bank that is expected to support the government. For Australia/UK/Japan/USA/Singapore/Iceland/Poland/Switzerland/Norway obviously that is no issue - for the Euro zone, probably only Germany is so well protected by virtue of likely being the last country that would find itself in crisis.",0,1353307878,null,0,1353309900,0,c73kzds,t3_13fu64,t1_c73kzds,t3_13fu64,null,1430444457,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

Certes, FEMEN a fait dans la provocation, mais on n'est pas au Yemen et, parce que la France est une démocratie, on doit savoir s'y tenir.

En 1989, quand Scorcese a sorti ""La dernière tentation du Christ"", les manifestants intégristes se contentaient de s'agenouiller en public pour prier. C'était très puissant.

Aujourd'hui, ils se sentent investis du devoir de frapper la chienne impudique qui les provoque, pourquoi, d'ailleurs?

Parce qu'ils ont PEUR que le mariage homosexuel (qui est avant tout, symboliquement parlant, la reconnaissance du droit de deux personnes qui s'aiment de prévoir l'avenir ensemble) n'ouvre la voie a l'adoption par les mêmes couples.

Et ça les emmerde pourquoi? Ils ont essayé d'adopter un gosse déjà? Tu passes DES ANNEES a te faire ausculter les finances, le subconscient, le voisinage, la prostate ou les kystes mamaires, même, et tout cela de la façon la plus inquisitrice possible, pour avoir un gosse qui, pendant cet interminable interrogatoire, pourrit dans un clapier en Bulgarie ou dans une champignonière à Saïgon (je sais de quoi je parle).

Un (ou un couple d') adoptant('s) présente suffisamment de garantie pour apporter à l'enfant l'affection dont il a besoin, ce n'est pas une affaire de sexualité: je suis convaincu que la plupart de ceux qui s'opposent à cette adoption ne passeraient pas les tests d'aptitude à l'adoption: trop cons, trop instables.

Un autre truc qui me dérange aussi, c'est ce commentaire, fort bien noté d'ailleurs, qui suggère qu'il n'est pas étonnant que les nanas de FEMEN se soient ""mangé des coups par des extrémistes"". Ben si, ""ça fait même plus que m'étonner: ça me troue le cul"". J'aurais été dans la manif, j'aurais latté ces espèces d'ordures qui s'en prennent à des femmes, si fofolles semblent elles.

Les nanas marquent ""fuck the church"" sur leur ventre?

What should be done, and what is actually the third way to manage Eurozone economy is to have Eurozone level of authority that can react to abnormal market changes in member countries by giving and guiding restructuring aid for regions and countries under a structural change. That wouldn't of course cure the unemployment rate quickly, but it would allow the economy to transform under 5-10 years into a different base.

true,TheMania,null,null,"&gt; Pumping money to these sectors would only postpone transformation of troubled economies and worst of all, it would waste lots of resources that could and should be put in better usage.

Unemployment is as bad as resource wastage goes. The 25 million unemployed across the Eurozone equates to a full billion man hours of labor lost every single week that Europe will *never* get back. If you're chasing small efficiency savings in government bureaucracy whilst a billion man hours of labor are going completely wasted, [I fear priorities may be a bit out of order](http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/?p=21501).

&gt; That would necessitate that some regions or industries would need to be abandoned if needed, European taxpayer money can't go on to be used to support way of life that is unsustainable.

The whole point that MMT drives is that government spending funds taxes, not the other way around. That when the non-government is desiring to save, that is, withdraw funds from circulation - the government needs to supply those extra funds by running a deficit. Crushing savings desires through austerity measures does not encourage people to spend, it just lowers the average level of savings by putting people out of work.

Taxes are instead not funding spending, but rather putting a brake on the private sector - shrinking it down, ensuring that there's sufficient resources available to the public sector for it's operating needs.

This is most significant (and likely controversial), as it means that when there's slack in the economy - mass unemployment across a country - you need not use taxes to employ those resources. Government bonds that are assumed to be as safe as cash (as issued by a government with money sovereignty, Canada/Japan/US etc) are sufficient, as is ""printed money"" (for they are effectively equivalent).

So if an EZ-level government is purely concerned with stimulus/restructuring it needn't use European taxpayers' money - it could just use ""printed money"". One solution would be have all governments require balanced budgets (the EFC), but have an EZ-level government [employ people at the minimum wage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_guarantee) using printed money. Such a system does not bid up the price of that labour as it employs people that the private sector does not want at the a price level the private sector cannot bid below. Those employees would be looking to buy basic goods/services, goods/services that the shrinking private sector has ample room to grow to support. Hence there'd be minimal inflation on the goods/services they demand too - the private sector would grow instead (what we're going for here), pulling those people out of the job guarantee. In essence: more spending on slack in the economy does not cause inflation no matter how it's funded. More spending when there's no slack always causes inflation, again, no matter how it's funded (savings/bonds/printing - it doesn't matter).

The only real catch of such a system is that these JG and new private sector jobs may not provide much/any exports, but some imports will be demanded - so it'll devalue the exchange rate somewhat, and cost Germany etc more exports (which many Germans will see as a positive). Long-term though it's better for everyone to have strong economies than ruined ones.

&gt; The problem with fixing the unemployment is that the lost employment was based on unsustainable bases, to public sector employment and to overheated construction sector.

Because you see government deficits as unsustainable. And they *are*, when you're using a currency you don't issue - which is the entire problem with the Euro. The Euro model is built on the assumption that people will never desire to save, as in aggregate net savings across the non-governments in a debt-based money system are only possible if the governments are running net deficits. If the Eurozone ever develops frugality - say due to a massive crisis as is going on today - it inevitably collapses.

The solution isn't to tax those countries that are near/at full employment with low inflation to give funds to those that are attempting to save (which is what you're imagining), as this would needlessly reduce growth and raise unemployment in the taxed countries. It's to simply deficit spend at the currency-issuing level instead. I'm still not entirely happy with doing this with a shared currency - there's still hazards with this approach - but it's far preferable to the status quo.

&gt; What should be done, and what is actually the third way to manage Eurozone economy is to have Eurozone level of authority that can react to abnormal market changes in member countries by giving and guiding restructuring aid for regions and countries under a structural change.

I do agree with this. This is largely what I was going for with the EZ-level government proposal. One that is not afraid to spend when everyone's trying to save. I wouldn't put any country through undue hardship though, there'd be little point. A rough time is probably still desirable, yes, to clear inefficiency in the private/public sectors, but there's certainly no need for it to be so bad that people are immigrating away from the country just to find a job.",0,1353316359,null,0,false,0,c73m6gk,t3_13fu64,t1_c73m6gk,t1_c73lohp,null,1430445069,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Actually not. What you don't take into account that when you employ people, you are A) consuming their time resource that they could have spend otherwise, for example re-educating themselves; and B) consuming some finite resource. For example if you would be putting all those unemployed construction workers back to building houses and motorways, you would use a lot more money to building materials than to wages, and those materials would be away from somewhere else.

Not to mention that the point of employment should be value creation. If you just employ people to public sector just for the sake of it, you won't be creating any new value with it. Actually in some point by removing resources from the labor pool and by enlarging public sector, you will start to destroy value by making the public sector slow and inefficient and unable to quickly serve changing needs of the society.

&gt; The whole point that MMT drives is that government spending funds taxes, not the other way around. That when the non-government is desiring to save, that is, withdraw funds from circulation - the government needs to supply those extra funds by running a deficit. Crushing savings desires through austerity measures does not encourage people to spend, it just lowers the average level of savings by putting people out of work.

Government spending only funds taxes if the money that is used creates more new value than is removed from holders of money via increased inflation. Printing money always creates inflation, not necessarily high or hyper inflation, but it always dilutes current value. If the spending doesn't create more value, then we are just moving resources from one area of the economy into another one.

true,simonask,DENK,Denmark,"&gt; This is beyond insulting. Incredibly so, actually. You speak with an authority where you have none, and in fact, it's amazing that you can even string together a sentence so despicable. The love for Kosovo is based on religion, history and identity. Not on resources.

Well, suck it up, because other people have feelings for the land too, and if you all think that you can only be happy if only people with your particular combination of language, culture, and religion live on the land, Serbia will remain Europe's war-torn backyard for centuries to come.

And please, spare me the bullshit — I *really* don't care about your feelings or national identity. The Serbian people must admit its mistakes, start building a country that they can be legitimately proud of, instead of waddling in self-pity and anger. The moment you make poignant geopolitical observations into ""insults"", you've lost before the game even started.

Also, it's *incredibly* naïve of you to think that Serbian discourse is not shaped by selfish motives (in the same way that Danish discourse is, French discourse is, and so on). Politicians will lie and manipulate to no end if they think they have something to gain from it, and in Serbia the Kosovo conflict is a hot potato.

&gt; Since people can apparently declare independence out of the blue once they gain majority, why shouldn't the northern part of Kosovo be ""allowed"" to split?

I think they should.

&gt; but since the West backed Kosovo, it's thought that Serbia wouldn't have played with the resources in a way the West would have wanted,

This is highly unlikely, even for a conspiracy theory.

The most likely explanation *by far* for the West's involvement in the conflict is the fact that many Western European countries are struggling with their own secessionist movements (Basque Country is a particularly dire example, but also Scotland, Flanders, Northern Ireland, and to an extent Scania). Creating international precedence for secessionism would be very problematic for these countries in their political situation at the time.

Of course, I completely disagree with that, and I think that every region that feels culturally distinct should have the right to declare independence or to declare themselves part of a neighboring country. United under the EU, something like that is actually even feasible without great social and economic changes.

&gt;&gt; Lastly, there is legitimate fear that Serbia will commence another of its ethnic cleansings of the area if the international community leaves it to them.
&gt;
&gt; No, there isn't. Turn off your Western media.

Dude, Western media never even talk about Serbia. The only reason I know the first thing about the country is the fact that I traveled the Balkan region myself, and I've heard this *exact* sentiment expressed personally by people in Belgrade, as well as by Serbs in the Copenhagen diaspora.

true,TheMania,null,null,"&gt; Printing money always creates inflation, not necessarily high or hyper inflation, but it always dilutes current value.

And issuing bonds does not?

Tell me this. If I'm in the position of the USA, and it's assumed that I'd sooner print than default, what's the difference?

I want to deficit spend $1000. I print $1000 worth of bonds, and sell them on the market at auction. The non-government then receives the bonds they purchased (worth $1000) and the $1000 of spending I performed. Now bonds are of course extremely liquid assets that can be converted to cash virtually on demand. Total net financial assets post deficit spend? +$1000. The non-government gets the $1000 of spending + an asset exchangable for $1000 of cash on the secondary market. So where is this deflationary pressure supposed to come from?

How is printing a $1000 financial asset and selling it to the market to raise $1000 of funds I can then deficit spend inherently different/safer than printing $1000 (cash financial assets) and just deficit spending that? Both ways increase the net financial assets of the non-government by +$1000.

I mean, bonds are extremely liquid. They're not a ""hold on cash"" - any holder of a bond can convert it to its value in cash on demand. Where then does the deflationary pressure come from?

&gt; If you just employ people to public sector just for the sake of it, you won't be creating any new value with it.

Of course they will be creating more value. They'll be expanding the private sector by their demand for goods/services. The unemployed do not/can not grow the private sector, as they have no cash to barter with. Give them cash, and they'll demand real and useful goods/services. But of course you can't simply ""give them cash"" as that'd be a large welfare trap but if you require them to work (a'la a job guarantee system) - there's no welfare trap created whatsoever.

&gt; For example if you would be putting all those unemployed construction workers back to building houses and motorways, you would use a lot more money to building materials than to wages, and those materials would be away from somewhere else.

Why would the private sector not grow to produce more building materials? It would have had no difficulty if people were taking out housing mortgages as in boom times to meet the demands of that extra money - why now, that the extra money is coming from a deficit spend, is the private sector unable to meet rising demand? After all there's widespread unemployment and resources going idle all over the country, businesses that normally produce building materials shutting up shop, etc - supply is hardly fixed.

&gt; The aim should be to transform individuals that the private sector doesn't need to individuals that the private sector wants.

The only way the unemployed can acquire funds is if *someone* runs a deficit. Normally in boom times this is fine, there's lots of people willing and able to take on housing mortgages etc - they provide the money for the unemployed to come into the loop. But what if householders aren't taking on debt? What if they're simply being frugal, unwilling to dissave?

Normally we tackle this by lowering interest rates, encouraging households to dissave/further encouraging them to take on debt/mortgages. Rates are already low though, and we cannot lower them further. Who then is going to dissave so the unemployed can earn a wage? You talk about making them desirable - how much longer do you think it'll take until the unemployed have developed such amazing skills that people are taking on debt to employ them again?",0,1353319289,null,0,1353330229,0,c73mh6t,t3_13fu64,t1_c73mh6t,t1_c73md2i,null,1430445209,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Betreuungsgeld is what a mom gets if they don't send their kids into a kita. The reason why this is such a big deal is, that certain parties (with waning influence) think it should be a mom's right to stay at home and still have something comparable. Hence the Betreuungsgeld.

Not considering this is being totally naive. Anyone who has ever spoken with any high ranking military knows they are constantly thinking about this kind of stuff, and they make it a point to tell their politicians too.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt;  And issuing bonds does not?

It depends on where the money comes from. If unused capital is used to by bonds, then it won't lead into increased inflation. However if the money comes from central banks in form of quantitative easing, then yes it will create inflation. In short term in time of recession where there is either low inflation or risk of deflation, then the added money in circulation doesn't cause show-able inflation. However in long term there will be inflation.

&gt;  Of course they will be creating more value. They'll be expanding the private sector by their demand for goods/services. The unemployed do not/can not grow the private sector, as they have no cash to barter with. Give them cash, and they'll demand real and useful goods/services. But of course you can't simply ""give them cash"" as that'd be a large welfare trap but if you require them to work (a'la a job guarantee system) - there's no welfare trap created whatsoever.

Consuming itself doesn't create value. We don't magically have more bread, oil or cars just because we consume more. Value creation starts from creating more goods and services that other people value and want to exchange value to it. For people to start create value in the public sector, they need to create something that people want. 

Another issue is that if you put more funds to non-value creators, you will corrupt price-signal systems of the economy that will cause wrong resource allocation that will lead into wasted resources. 

Not to mention that most developed European countries have welfare and unemployment programs that provide basic income to out of work people. People get enough funds that they stay alive, and are able to consume their time the way they see best for themselves, for example by studying or applying for work.

&gt;  Why would the private sector not grow to produce more building materials? It would have had no difficulty if people were taking out housing mortgages as in boom times to meet the demands of that extra money - why now, that the extra money is coming from a deficit spend, is the private sector unable to meet rising demand? After all there's widespread unemployment and resources going idle all over the country, businesses that normally produce building materials shutting up shop, etc - supply is hardly fixed.

More fundamental question is, is there any demand for additional construction? There is no use to build something that doesn't have any need. What value does it create to have empty building? What value does it create to have motorways that nobody uses? Japan tried this route to take it out of the 90s recession, but funding of new infrastructure didn't take the country of recession, it only prolonged it.

Better idea is to stop unneeded construction and allow people to self-adjust. There is no reason why unemployed construction worker couldn't with time and education become a caretaker / nurse, shop keeper, assembly worker, truck driver, etc... That is the way to create value and new growth.

&gt;  The only way the unemployed can acquire funds is if someone runs a deficit. Normally in boom times this is fine, there's lots of people willing and able to take on housing mortgages etc - they provide the money for the unemployed to come into the loop. But what if householders aren't taking on debt? What if they're simply being frugal, unwilling to dissave?

That is not true. Taxation can and should be used to transfer incomes from individuals with more disposable income to people with non- or low-levels of income. The motivation for the society to do this is to prevent loosing of value creation potential, in short people.",0,1353323781,null,0,false,0,c73mvzz,t3_13fu64,t1_c73mvzz,t1_c73mh6t,null,1430445403,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

My native language is not very widely-spoken in Europe (probably in the range of 20-25 mil. people?), so I am not saying this from the perspective of a citizen of an English-speaking country.

My main reasons for this are:

* The difficulty of good technical language translation. I can't emphasize this enough -- any amount of standardization effort is insufficient when it comes to this. A good translation takes time and slows down any kind of communication, and even then it still leads to weird results. I remember one of my early classes in university, where the professor kept mentioning a term I panicked for not understanding (I had missed the previous class :-s); once I saw it in a graph, I immediately recognized it as the offset voltage; the translated term sounded nothing like that.
* It makes data mining, classification, indexing and organization of the research material infinitely easy if they're in a single language. It's not because that particular language is English and, thus, has certain qualities -- it's because it's a *single* language that a lot of people already talk. It might as well be Esperanto, were that spoken by people who are not geeks passionate about languages.
* It makes talking to people at conferences a lot easier -- and really, while the talks are important, what happens after them is probably one of the most effective thought catalysts. The chances of everyone speaking everyone else's language in a room where there are people from Denmark, Scotland, the Czech Republic, Spain and Poland are rather slim -- not to mention it would be unwieldy to learn, what, 10 languages just to make sure you can talk to everyone.

&gt; In Denmark there's been some public debate on the issue, mostly citing research that not being taught in you mother tongue can be a problem for learning.

This is probably true for elementary and maybe even high-school level. After that, I really call bullshit on it. Doing *anything useful* with the information that has been taught to you in your mother tongue will at the very least require massive amounts of reading English documentation, at least in modern/high-technology fields.

They considered various pieces of evidence, each not particularly impressive it its own, if mutually supportive, can still make a powerful case that something happened. It is the appeals chamber majority that required some direct evidence is presented to make the case even viable, and any further supportive indication can only be interpreted as supportive if this is first established (or plausible). I'm glad presumption of innocence in international criminal courts will be stronger in the future after this precedent.

What I meant was - I could see ethnic cleansing of the serbs being planned by the likes of Tudjman etc, and the documentation of various war crimes is fairly extensive in the verdict. 

Now, whether this was ESTABLISHED, whether he was held to standards of international military law in the sentence or were those arbitrary, really isn't up to me to say or consider, with two chambers of accomplished international judges to worry about that. And, the legal practice such as this trial, is what will end up defining such standards in the first place, since international law is developed by custom and precedent and judicial practice as much as by any explicit treaties.

And the 200m criteria was one of the few (or even only?) things that the appeals chamber rejected unanimously. So you're apparently right.

I have to agree though that, disregarding law or military technology, it is a matter of mere statistics (and hence accessible to a non-lawyer) that you cannot treat a bunch of projectiles with a certain margin of error the same way as you would a single projectile. Perhaps it is implausible for an individual projectile to miss the target by as much as 200m - or not, in any case its up to the military witnesses to convince the court one way or the other. Appeals chamber concluded anyhow that they pulled that number from their ass, even though they did have witnesses to establish what a reasonable margin would be, there was no connection between those testimonies and their criteria (unanimously, as I mentioned).

BUT if the chance of a single projectile missing so much is say a couple of percent, and hence say enough to take it as proof it wasn't an accident, still then in a hundred projectiles, you should EXPECT a couple of them to miss by that much. What you should be betting on is the DISTRIBUTION of the scattering being consistent with targeting, with some missing by this much , less by more etc. Rather than betting on a particular absolute margin of error.

true,TheMania,null,null,"&gt; However if the money comes from central banks in form of quantitative easing, then yes it will create inflation.

The US has created an unprecedented amount of money in this fashion, converting [over $2tn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing#Amounts) worth of bonds and MBS's to cash. No inflation to write home about whatsoever.

Just to put $2tn into context, that's enough to employ every single unemployed person in America, all 12.3 million of them, at the full $15k minimum wage for *over 10 years*. It's a staggeringly huge amount of money, I fear this is lost on people. If this QE = inflation theory were to hold why is there so little to show for it?

Surely if the US had performed zero QE, but the US government had boosted its bond-funded deficit from $1.3tn to $3.3tn the economy would be well and truly overheated. Yet you'd seemingly argue that a $3.3tn deficit would *not* be at all inflationary if it wasn't QE funded. I have to disagree here - you're going to get inflation *whenever* there's too much spending occurring, regardless of whether it's bond funded, new money, or funded from government savings.

Same with Japan - huge amounts of quantitative easing for decades and their concern is still *deflation*.

&gt; In short term in time of recession where there is either low inflation or risk of deflation, then the added money in circulation doesn't cause show-able inflation.

And therein lies the problem with QE. The money doesn't enter circulation, it instead just sits as banking reserves. Remember from the [quantity theory of money](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity_theory_of_money), prices are determined according to the amount of spending that's occurring vs the amount of production. Money that's out of circulation does not come into it.

If banks could lend money out, if they had the credit worthy customers requesting loans, they would have already converted bonds to cash on the secondary market to make those loans *with or without QE*. If not converting bonds, they would have borrowed off the [interbank lending market](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interbank_lending_market) at 0% interest to make that loan. Or alternatively, pulled their own funds off that market. After all, the bank stands to make more interest on loans to customers than they're getting on bonds or on the 0% interbank lending market.

Banks already weren't lending money out and buying bonds off them (QE) bolstering their reserve positions does little to affect their lending decisions.

Hence QE being so wildly ineffective at it's stated aim - making more loans occur. Banks will lend to any and all credit worthy customers regardless of their reserve position. This is an important fact - banks know they can borrow limitless quantities on the interbank lending markets at the cash rate set by the central bank so they're never going to turn away a credit-worthy customer due to insufficient reserves.

This is again MMT thinking, that the [money multiplier is a myth](http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/?p=1623).

&gt; We don't magically have more bread, oil or cars just because we consume more.

It isn't magic, but supply will expand. Of course it will. If there's slack in the economy and more people start buying bread, the breadmakers expand their capacity to meet demand. They won't put up prices - not when there's room for them to grow - as they know that if they were to put up prices they'd lose share to their competitors that *are* willing to expand. The exception to this is once you're at full capacity. Once capacity has been reached more money chasing bread will lead to inflation yes. We can only consume what we produce - the important thing to realise is that today we are not producing all we can. Not by a long shot.

&gt; Japan tried this route to take it out of the 90s recession, but funding of new infrastructure didn't take the country of recession, it only prolonged it.

To what are you comparing Japan to? Because I look at Japan - **peak** unemployment over the decade of just ~5.5% and peak negative growth of nearly (-2%) - and I find it hard to conclude that they chose the wrong option when compared to the path the PIIGS. I mean heck, Spain/Greece - over 25% of people are out of work in these nations. I find it really hard to believe that Japan chose the wrong path if that's where austerity would have taken it (and I believe it would have).

&gt; More fundamental question is, is there any demand for additional construction?

Ask an unemployed person what they want, and they'll say a job. Ask them what they want the wage for, and they'll name some goods and services.

At that there's absolutely demand for more goods, services and jobs. A job guarantee provides all three. It firstly provides the unemployed with the job they desire, secondly it provides them with the ability to barter with the private sector buying the goods and services they desire, pulling that private sector out of recession in doing so. As the private sector grows it can pull any JG employees it needs for growth off the system by merely offering higher wages or better conditions.

Don't worry so much about the goods actually produced by those in the JG. The whole purpose behind it is to the benefit *the private sector*. It allows the private sector to continue producing the goods and services people desire. If that isn't meeting demand I don't know what is.

&gt; That is not true.

It absolutely *is* true. The only way an unemployed person can acquire a wage is if someone else is dissaving. You argue that this isn't true as we can raise taxes on those with higher disposable incomes - *that is those people dissaving*. Forcibly, by government taxation. I don't have an issue with this, but don't think you've avoided the problem that for someone to acquire a wage someone needs to dissave. And this really is the fundamental problem facing the PIIGS today. That nobody's spending, everyone's saving, despite interest rates giving them every incentive to spend.

Of course, that never happened. It never happened because the EU has been founded on the principles of 'power creep' and has constantly misrepresented itself since its inception (and the inception of the treaties, agreements and mechanisms that pre-date it). That may be a mistake on the part of UK politicians who knew exactly what they were letting us in for, but it is also dishonesty on the part of all who began this great experiment in the first place.

Before you dismiss this view as one of a biased eurosceptic, I should point out that I am a technocratic / technological-socialist who believes in not just a united Europe, but a full-blown One World Government. 

Unfortunately, for all my love of federalisation, I believe - as many do in the UK - that *this* Union is fundamentally illegitimate, dishonest, unsustainable and has significant democratic deficits that undermine any credibility or moral authority it attempts to convey.

By all means, let us have a European Union. Just not *this* European Union.

Ultimately, it will be inevitable that national sovereignty will be obsolete, and that all European states will come under the aegis of the EU government. This isn't even something that is up for debate any more, almost every member of the EU agrees that this is an inevitability - that ever-strengthening political union is the only way to keep the EU together. Is the EU Parliament and it's various institutions really a good model for a new superstate? A compromise-model based on obsolete political and diplomatic philosophies, that is completely unprepared for a modern, ever-changing world. A system based around ideals of production and historical resources that will be a laughable conceit in under 20 years time, given the rate of current technological progress. A monolithic system that, seemingly, has ignored the last 40 years of technological progress, new methods of democratic integration, social theory, economic theory and everything else. A system that makes the US government look like a model of streamlined efficiency for Christ's sake.

Of course, this might just be me (and probably other young people). I do, after all, believe that the majority of government should be software, including laws.

Frankly, I'd rather have Google as a model for government (with their AI, augmented reality and total surveillance) than the EU. It's just so... obsolete. What could be a model for 21st century governance, instead is comprised of the most inefficient, discredited, unworkable and stupid ideas of the 19th century that only keeps stumbling along because of a shared passion for integration and a fear of what will happen if we fail.

How am I wrong in my assessment of UK *contributions*? When you write about *contributors* I take that word as exactly that. So I reply accordingly.

*Net*-contributor on the other hand is actually hard to measure because it needs to take into account the benefits a country receives. Some are easy - agriculture subsidies because they go through a central financial channel - others are very hard, for example subsidies for regional structural development. Something the UK benefits quite a lot from. This is the reason I don't really trust some half-baked statistics by British papers. I don't think they are truly qualified to do that. 

I'd argue that one should also take into account the indirect benefits from membership, simply by taking advantage of access to the common market. The EUs policies, especially the banking reforms and the common market made the London city into what it is today. The only reason non-British banks opened huge branches there is *because* of the EU.

Also there are people who would not testify against a person who could face the death penalty which in theory could leave a guilty individual free.

Japan isn't a western country. There are also plenty of other non-western countries which have abolished the death penalty like  ~~Brazil~~ Columbia, Mexico and Namibia.

&gt; If I supported these punishments, I would want them over here. But I am not - so instead of locking the perpretator up for life, I am giving him a chance of life in freedom in a surrounding more suited to his worldview.

In an earlier post you said we disagree on execution, unless you misunderstood me let me clarify: I am against the death penalty. A life in *freedom*? More like a chance of getting tortured and killed. Are you trolling me? If a person is fleeing his country because of torture, then how does deporting him have a realistic chance of being free?

The hand is not leaving the EU, neither the EU-sceptical Conservatives or the pro-EU Labour and Liberal Democrats advocate leaving the EU.  The Conservatives are openly playing a renegotiation hand in Britain's interests, as well as those others that would fair well out of it.

&gt;Can we afford it?

Renegotiation costs very little (much of it is already paid for), indeed the whole point being that it not only saves but potentially raises more, and leaving the EU would cost very little initially and save in the future, not that that's the point given that the premise of EU renegotiation not negotiation to leave the EU.  Under the Lisbon Treaty a country leaving has at least 2 years to renegotiate trade deals and it's in nobody's interest to cut their noses off to spite their face.  Nobody is arguing losing EU trade, not even UKIP - that's just fear mongering.  They very much argue it on an economic platform.

&gt;Is it beneficial in the long term?

Yes, renegotiation in favour of the UK, and the UK having flanked the static EU to gain a favourable renegotiation hand is very much beneficial in the long term.
   
That is why I called it a sweet hand.  The constitutional referendum is on future treaties and more transfer of power.  'They' need it but they can't afford it to go the UK *public* to stall it without pouring a sugar bowl over the UK deal.

true,Gro-Tsen,null,null,"There are several big problems here.

One is that it's very difficult to learn about History without getting entangled in a web of clichés and misinterpretations because one will look at a past era with modern eyes.  Take the Gauls, for example: many modern Frenchmen are still somehow convinced that they are the descendants or heirs of the Gauls more than of the Romans, which is an incredibly silly notion (for one thing, just about every human being currently on the planet is a descendent of every single people that lived back then; and culturally, the French language, and just about every bit of culture that can be traced that far back, is Roman in origin, not Gaulish).  Interestingly enough, this idea of France being the continuation of ancient Gaul is itself not so old: it dates from the late 1800's, when history books were written for the public schools created by Jules Ferry.  An older\[#\] cliché would be that of Clovis (seeing him as a ""French"" king is really an anachronism), or Charlemagne (that one's rather funny because the French see him as the predecessor of the kings of France and the Germans as that of the German emperors—of course he could be said to be both, but it would probably be less misleading to think that he was neither).

\[#\] By ""older"", of course, I mean the date where the cliché appeared, not the date it's referring to.

So anyway, people have a lot of misconceptions about History.  And, in a way, the misconceptions themselves become part of History (as ""popular historiography""), so it gets really complicated, but perhaps all the more fascinating.  And, after all, the fictional Vercingétorix who was more or less ""invented"" by the French 3rd republic for its History books is probably more relevant to understanding modern France than the real Vercingétorix.

Another problem relates to the way History is taught.  In France, basically, in middle school, you're supposed to learn about Antiquity in 6th grade, the Middle Ages and Renaissance in the 7th grade, the Modern period (from the Enlightenment up to the Industrial revolution) in the 8th grade, and Contemporary history in the 9th grade; then you start more or less all over again (but refocusing on the more recent periods) in high school, learning about the whole period up to the mid-19th century in 10th grade, the late 19th century and up to WW2 in 11th grade, and contemporary geopolitics (starting with the Cold war) in the 12th grade.  This isn't absurd, but: (1) ancient history is very badly understood because it's only taught in the 6th and 7th grade (you're supposed to skim over it a second time in the 10th grade but History teachers don't have much time for it), and it's probably too alien for young children to understand without getting entangled in all the clichés, and (2) various periods get overlooked because they sort of all ""between the gaps"", most importantly the 19th century.  So the result is, one comes out of this with a rather good knowledge of the French revolution and World Wars 1 and 2 and perhaps even the Cold war, but often dreadfully ignorant of the Congress of Vienna and the European revolutions of 1830, 1848 and 1870, and also with a silly children's book vision of Antiquity and the Middle Ages.

And, of course, lots of people in France are sadly unaware of the History of neighboring European countries, which I think is terrible because I think European History only makes sense as a whole: one cannot understand Francis I of France if one doesn't look at Charles V at the same time, one cannot understand the events of 1870 without learning about the unification of Italy and Germany, etc.",0,1353334915,null,0,false,0,c73o7xx,t3_13g00b,t1_c73o7xx,t3_13g00b,null,1430446111,9,false,france,t5_2qhjz,9

The EU is what people make it, there's no real reason why the argument should be reduced down to in or out, black or white.  Why shouldn't there be an EU-lite, or even an EEA-strong which actually brings the EEA into the EU, as well as an EU-Heavy for pro-federalists, without demanding that it's 'all chips in or nothing'?

There are several things which a broad brush stroke across the whole of the EU, which might be a net positive across the whole, but actually provides a net hurt for certain contributors.  CAP, CFP is not geared for UK interests, neither is the Tobin transaction tax.  These might be good things in general but in the specific case of the UK they're all harmful.  It makes sense that there is a common trade commissioner for most of Europe but again the UK is somewhat uniquely placed in that it has strong cultural and historic ties (both linguistically, culturally, and as joint-creator of the Commonwealth spanning a third of the world's population), and an economy which is not indicative of the mainland, where actually *always* having to go through the EU trade commission is harmful.  Why shouldn't the UK remain a net contributor, continue to contribute towards the common market, but only have a say in matters that affects itself, devolve, and be allowed to have more say in its agriculture, fishing and overseas trade on the condition that when a 3rd party wants to trade through the UK with Europe that it tows the common market line established by the EU?

The UK has now passed the European Union Act.  The EU is arguing for more powers and whether the UK government agrees or not it is now obliged under law to put any power transfers to a referendum before the British public, and who everybody knows they'll shoot them down as things stand.

If the EU wants anymore powers, which it needs, the only way it can do it without facing a doomed referendum blocking those powers being granted is to sweeten the UK deal.

It's perfect.

It's got nothing to do with Cameron eroding good will, not that he had much - constitutionally the UK has put a block in which prevents the EU circumventing such issues like it did with the EU constitution, which ironically enough the French blocked.

&gt;There's plenty of countries that have referenda on new EU deals and it hasn't really stopped anything from happening.

It stopped the proposed EU wide constitution but they worked around it by rewriting it as a treaty and then strong arming the Irish.  The UK however has now passed a law to prevent that happening again.

You can't argue this from an old standpoint.  You have to address the new changes that have already been made altering the previous status quo:

http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/12/contents/enacted/data.htm

Your move Europe.  You can't evict the UK but they may elect to leave.  The three main parties don't want to leave and whilst the UK is still there the major transfer of powers can't happen without throwing the UK a rather meaty bone to appease them.

I'm not saying it's morally right.  Or that you have to like it.  I am saying that in a deliciously Machiavellian turn of events the UK has been left holding the EU's keys to unlock major federalist reform.

You don't think that it is just a little bit dodgy that the referendum was re-run, not because of technical issues with voting or irregularities or anything sensible, but because the EU didn't like the result?

In my country they don't re-run a referendum a few months later on the same topic just because they didn't like the answer. 

&gt; I'm sorry, what? If the laws in member states didn't require for a referendum, or officials didn't want to put it to a referendum, why should they have put it to a referendum?

I was referring to the EU constitition - the document that was voted on in a few countries like Spain, France and the Netherlands. I am pretty sure that in all three countries the majority voted against it. No wonder, then, that it was reformulated into a document that didn't require such scrutiny.

I live in the UK - the then government was elected on the basis that they'd give us a referendum on the EU constitition. We never got one, and we never got one on the Lisbon treaty because they aren't the same document even though they are largely identical.

You're displaying the EU mindset quite well here - ""we don't need to know what the people think because the law doesn't force us to"". It shouldn't be about whether the law forces anyone to hold a referendum, it should be able doing the right thing for the country by allowing its citizens to vote in their future (and not the EU).

They didn't like the result, law doesn't forbid them from having another referendum, so they did it again, and passed it. What's the problem? It was within the law.

&gt;I was referring to the EU constitition - the document that was voted on in a few countries like Spain, France and the Netherlands. I am pretty sure that in all three countries the majority voted against it. No wonder, then, that it was reformulated into a document that didn't require such scrutiny.

It was EU Constitution which was rejected. Treaty of Lisbon is an international agreement that amends the two treaties which form the constitutional basis of the European Union. It forms *constitutional basis*. It's not a constitution.

Unfortunately their tactics worked, and as you surely realise they had absolutely no interest to do what's best for our country but to make the government look foolish.

Just go your own way already, but stop trying to convince *us* that we shouldn't want to cooperate.

It's a bit like playing soccer. Somehow you guys joined the team, but now you don't like it anymore, and instead of just leaving and doing something else you're trying to convince the rest of the team that the game sucks and that they should give it up altogether because obviously your team is losing anyway (huh?).

So yeah, I'm not going to convince you to be or stay a EU member. If you want out, then go. But if you want in, then play the game and don't cry foul every time someone looks dirty at you or asks you to run a bit faster.

I wasn't disputing that it wasn't illegal - it isn't - but it's slightly immoral and patronising to the people of Ireland whose decision wasn't accepted because it wasn't the answer the EU wanted.

&gt; It was EU Constitution which was rejected. Treaty of Lisbon is an international agreement that amends the two treaties which form the constitutional basis of the European Union. It forms constitutional basis. It's not a constitution.

Are you an EU bureaucrat? You're parroting the exact lines that I've already stated were the reasoning behind the lack of public vote in all but one EU member states. It doesn't matter that it's technically different, the fact is that in spirit it's the EU constitution but just engineered to make it easier to pass. I completely disagreed with my own government's decision to forego a referendum on the basis that it ""wasn't the EU constition"" because in practice it was.

&gt; It's a representative democracy, not direct democracy.

That doesn't mean that some things don't require direct democracy. Plenty of representative democracies run referenda (is that the right word) when it comes to large issues. The UK has had a few over the years specifically over EEC/EU matters, and most recently to vote on changing the electoral system.

No, but they can certainly stop them from doing it as part of the EU.  They can even stop individual members from using EU buildings whilst they do it!  Example: last December when Cameron walked out and they had to book hotel rooms!!!

&gt;If we wanted to engage in some enhanced cooperation then that could trigger a referendum but that just makes it less likely that any other EU member would involve the UK in any project

Hence a two tier EU is inevitable.  The water in the mortar.

&gt;I'm not denying the existence of a two-tiered Europe part or passing judgement on whether I think the current or old arrangements are good or bad. All I'm saying is that it isn't that big of a deal for anyone but the UK. 

Ho-ho, yes it is.   Countries would kill for the special terms early members got, especially what the UK got.  You think Sweden is just going to look on longingly whilst the UK dodges the Tobin Tax?  Or Poland is going to just let it slip that other members like Sweden can negotiate not entering the Euro?  There is no federalism without consensus.  

So the UK just votes down an extension of the EU budget and the rest of the EU just go ahead, ignores it and tries to carry on?

Doesn't work that way I'm afraid.  It gets frozen until the next year.  Just an example.  Wanna sit down and negotiate why the Royal Flush shouldn't take quite all your chips yet - it's the core EZ that need those reforms.

&gt;If the referendum clause was added to try and stop the rest of the EU doing what they want, it's not a very effective way to do it.

Helluva a PR shit storm of this, and what has gone before regarding EU referendums, to speculate that.

Wishful thinking does not trump legal ruling and historic precedence, I'm afraid.

What I want to say is : To understand current french politics you have to look at what happened between WWI and WWII when french people refused fascism by electing a somewhat leftwing assembly, look at the Liberation when De Gaulle and the Resistant Council took some huge step towards a modern society socially speaking and then look at what he did during his terms with his foreign policy politics ( Keeping colonies, no foreign interference in our domestic politics, kicking the US outside of France, nuclear weapons etc.)",0,1353345604,null,0,false,0,c73qpi6,t3_13g00b,t1_c73qpi6,t1_c73o01p,null,1430447233,2,false,france,t5_2qhjz,2

I'm usually quite happy to read something by the Financial Times, which, in its perspective on the Eurocrisis seems to fall somewhere in between the more left-leaning Guardian and the more right-leaning, well, most of the German newspapers for example.

I don't agree entirely with what they write here (for one, ""Ms Merkel is now being nothing if not assertive"" is plain hyperbole), but I agree with their basic narrative: a) that the crisis has lost some, maybe most, of its ""existential"" threat, b) that Germany (and the other big net payers) have resigned themselves to pay up for the continued existence of the Euro, and c) that the debtor countries likewise have resigned themselves to accept that the creditor nations largely define the conditions of the bailout(s), i.e. accept most of the austerity measures.

What the article doesn't really answer, and what I've been wondering about myself, is what *caused* this change of heart of everybody involved. While Draghi's decision for unlimited bond buying (the reason the article mentions) certainly marks a major turning point, it doesn't answer *how* it came to this point -- why for example Merkel didn't throw her full weight against this position (it's quite improbable Draghi would have went ahead without at least the tacit approval by Merkel).

My own best answer for this question, far from complete, but what I chose to believe for now: *attrition*. Pure and simple.

After by now 4 years of crisis, with weekly doomsday predictions by the media, left and right, loud and obnoxious accusations and political theater in every country involved, and well-meant economical advice by respectable scholars that unfortunately however almost always contradicted the advice given by another scholar the week before -- after all of this going on for years, I think everybody just got tired of it.

Tralasciando il problema puramente economico, aprire un'azienda in Italia è una rottura di coglioni tra sindacati starnazzanti, leggi inappropriate, arretratezza culturale, burocrazia opprimente e ridicolaggini tipo i certificati antimafia.

Unlike walking out there's no legal provision for that, and there can't be until they kick us out because we'd be able to veto it: Catch 22 and Law's a Bitch.

&gt; and that would be truly disastrous if you care or believe at all in the European Integration project.

Even a voluntarily 'evacuation' by law carries a 2 year interim to negotiate trade and security terms.  Neither can afford to lose that much trade in this climate; even if it were legally viable, which it's not, it'd be a boat burning Pyrhhic victory.

No fish, not biting; no bogeyman under the bed, not looking.

&gt;We're not contributing enough and exercising far too much political power over it without the economic contribution. 

In the last two years the UK contribution has gone up over 70% with nothing extra in return.  Trade has actually gone down.  Rebate has gone down.  The power transfer has gone up.  The UK's not even part of the Euro and it contributed over £30bn, and it stepped in first to guarantee Irish debt before anybody else acted.  And the UK voluntarily opted to designated its own EU battalion for defense...and it was the first to step to the line regarding the impending crisis in the first winter of the Yugoslavian crisis, and it has been, and is set to be, the largest net contributor per capita...and the CFP and CAP which the UK contributes to both harm its own industries...

Questo lo voglio anche io, ma il problema è che se hai un camion che va a tutta velocità in una direzione che non ti piace, fargli cambiare direzione con una cannonata non è il massimo. Il sistema economico in cui siamo non è di per sè sbagliato. È semplicemente un _dannato_ casino organizzare un sistema complesso (non complesso difficile, complesso come complessità strutturale). La civiltà si basa sulla delegazione, ""schiavi"" e ""schiavisti"" dipende solo dalla tua libertà, in quanto parte della società, di avere certe garanzie o libertà di reimpiego, ma resti comunque dipendente dalla società. Sei implicitamente uno schiavo, e se non lo fossi di un umano, saresti uno schiavo del tuo stomaco, del tuo campo e delle tue capre in ogni caso.

Il sistema non è perfetto, e si può certo cambiare e migliorare, ma farlo non è ne' immediato, ne' spesso fattibile. Spesso bisogna fare passi semplici e non distruttivi per raggiungere un obbiettivo lontano (lasciare evolvere il sistema), ma non è detto assolutamente che le condizioni esterne te lo consentano. A meno di rivoluzioni dalla dubbia efficacia e dalla sicura distruzione degli sforzi e infrastrutture guadagnate finora, cambiare un sistema con una massa simile (mondiale) non è immediato ne' banale.

true,donkey_lz,null,null,"&gt; Of course, instead of scrapping English, one could raise the proficiency of everybody. I guess that is what is happening here where English is taught at a very early age.

Yes, I think this is the way to go, too. If there is no professor who commands English sufficiently well to teach, then the course *should* not be taught in English. I don't think a ""screw you, from now on everything is English"" approach can lead to anything useful.

&gt; However, teaching undergradute courses in the native language is something different than having a common research language. 

It feels that way, but then the ""common research language"" is really about the same things you teach at undergraduate level. It's also not only about research -- it's about industry as well. Every datasheet for an electronic component, every piece of documentation for a CPU, every assembly line parameter set is in English, and it's simply not feasible to provide tens of translations for every language on Earth. And it's also about studying at undergraduate level: having a good command of English means you have a huge breadth of study material at your disposal, without being limited by the time (and quality) constraints of translations.

Of course, we all like our native language, the one in which we learned to say ""I love you"" and in which every piece of literary work sounds best. But honestly, the perpetuation of linguistic beauty does not depend on microwave oven instructions being written in every language there is.

Good luck with that. 

Ariane 5 can put in orbit twice as much as falcon 9. Actually Falcon 9 doesn't compete with Ariane 5 but with Soyouz, the medium-lift range of launch systems which it's also launched from the European spaceport at Kourou in French Guiana.

Soyouz being the most frequently used launch vehicle and I think the cheapest and most reliable. Ariane also is one of the most reliable and it has the ability to launch multiple payloads (which is not such an easy thing to do). And reliability is not a trivial thing from the client point of view when your satellite worth a few millions dollars.

There are several states against extending the EU budget, the dialogue is completely split on where the EU should move too.  Even last year at the December talks even France and Germany disagreed whether the proposed reforms should be EU inclusive or EZ.

&gt;It's called the EEA! They voluntarily harmonise, so goods are valid for use across their borders, but trade's still a bitch.

And why shouldn't that be reformed is the question I asked.  As for trade a bitch for the EEA they have the four freedoms; freedom of goods, services, capital and people.  'Trade' apparently is a $5/hr loose 'bitch', if that's the metaphor on how you want to think on it.

&gt;**Merkel has decided to pay up for the euro**
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;The other day I heard someone say that Angela Merkel intends to fight next autumn’s German election as the chancellor who saved Europe. Those still worried about the future of the euro will be reassured by her confidence. The crowds of striking workers who took to Europe’s streets this week to protest against austerity are less likely to applaud.
&gt;
&gt;Not too long ago, Ms Merkel faced criticism for hesitancy and indecision. Radoslaw Sikorski, Poland’s foreign minister, made a pilgrimage to Berlin to demand she pick up the reins of leadership. It had been a long time since a Polish politician had called for a more assertive Germany.
&gt;
&gt;Ms Merkel is now being nothing if not assertive. The individual ingredients in her recent speech to the European Parliament – fiscal rectitude, improved competitiveness, deeper financial integration and eurozone economic governance – were scarcely groundbreaking. Together they represent Germany’s conditions for securing the future of the single currency. Berlin has decided that, one way or another, it cannot avoid picking up the bill. So it wants to set the terms. Austerity now and shared decision-making later is the price others must pay for German solidarity.
&gt;
&gt;The euro is not out of the woods. A spat between eurozone governments and the International Monetary Fund has underlined the scale of the economic crisis still engulfing Greece. The dispute itself – about whether Greece’s debt to GDP ratio should fall to 120 per cent by 2020 or 2022 – was surreal. Everyone knows that Greece will have to write off another hefty slab of its debt. The question is one of timing.
&gt;
&gt;Spain needs a bailout package. So does Cyprus. For all its success in restoring competitiveness, Ireland badly needs relief from the burden of bank debt. Sovereign bond rates are still way too high and bank balance sheets too weak. Without growth, voter frustration has turned to anger in the peripheral economies.
&gt;
&gt;That said, the air of existential crisis has dissipated. Predictions of the euro’s imminent demise proved premature. The common assumption now is that politics is trumping economics.
&gt;
&gt;Mario Draghi’s announcement that the European Central Bank was ready to buy the bonds of distressed governments is rightly seen as the turning point. History may well record that it was “Super Mario” who finally saved the euro. The initiative was possible, though, only because Ms Merkel took the side of the ECB against the Bundesbank. She is not the first chancellor to defy Germany’s central bank. Helmut Kohl overruled it on the terms of unification. Ms Merkel’s decision was no less significant for that.
&gt;
&gt;For most of the postwar period, German public policy rested on the twin pillars of sound money and an unwavering commitment to Europe. There were occasional tensions between the two, as at the start of the 1980s when Mr Kohl fell out badly with François Mitterrand about French economic policy. But by and large, the two goals sat comfortably together. The euro crisis has changed that. It threatens conflict between domestic monetary stability and Germany’s debt to Europe. Ms Merkel has chosen Europe.
&gt;
&gt;The other pivotal decision was an about-turn on Greece. During the first half of the year, the view in Berlin was that Greece was beyond redemption. It lacked the basic levers of governance to restore credible economic management. Grexit looked at once inevitable and survivable. That judgment changed during the summer. Ms Merkel decided that just as Lehman Brothers had brought down the global financial system, Greece could break apart the eurozone.
&gt;
&gt;None of this impresses the serried ranks of economists who insist the euro is still heading for catastrophe. At a recent conference hosted by the Centre for European Reform I heard many of them argue with some force that collective austerity will prove self-defeating and will collide sooner or later with political resistance in the indebted countries.
&gt;
&gt;The economists have a point – but they also miss one. In complaining that the politicians do not understand the economics, they fail to grasp the politics. The idea that Ms Merkel could have told Italy or Spain to forget painful reforms and carry on spending and borrowing, in the expectation that Germany would underwrite the debt, belongs to the realm of political fantasy. The criticism that strikes home is the one that says Germany cannot expect others to cut their current account deficits and at the same time hold on to its own surplus.
&gt;
&gt;Things cannot go on as they are. The lesson of the past couple of years is that they won’t. Ms Merkel promised there would be no bailouts; and has since signed up to a procession of well, bailouts. The eurozone now has a permanent rescue system and a central bank that, in extremis, will act as lender as last resort. Everything suggests that Germany will continue to adapt policy to circumstance.
&gt;
&gt;The best way to look at what is happening in the eurozone is as a classic negotiation between creditor and insolvent debtors. Germany knows that the debtors cannot pay in full but before it agrees to a writedown, it is determined to extract guarantees that history will not repeat itself. Ms Merkel has decided to pay up, but in return she needs assurances sufficient to convince German voters that this is not just a first instalment.
&gt;
&gt;No one could argue that this has been an efficient way of managing the crisis. Europe cannot deflate its way out of trouble. But the euro has always been as much a political as an economic enterprise. And if Germany is writing the cheques, Germany will set the rules.

true,markgraydk,DENK,Denmark,"&gt;  I don't think a ""screw you, from now on everything is English"" approach can lead to anything useful.

With the staff budgets at a lot of public European universities it may not be possible to hire professors that both are excellent researchers, good teachers and have the language proficiency required. Maybe it will change with time when younger people take over leading roles in academia, considering they will probably be more proficient.

&gt; It feels that way, but then the ""common research language"" is really about the same things you teach at undergraduate level. It's also not only about research -- it's about industry as well. 

I think that's a good point but a lot of the students will not necesarilly work somewhere where they need English (as a primary language at least). I've experienced working for a company where my lack of an Danish technical vocabulary was a hindrance. I took this as an opportunity to learn it and now it's nice to be comfortable having both. 

However, I still, and lots of people I know, still have these odd conversations where we mix languages because it is difficult to convey some concepts in our native languages. That works fine, I guess, but I think it provides yet another demarcation between different professions. I think this allienates people a lot. Why do you think business adminstration/management is criticised for its buzzword/bullshit bingo? Or engineering for its techno babble?

As you said before, this subreddit is quite anti-muslim. Scare tactics  are very common. There are problems with immigration, but nowhere near as bad as people in subreddits like this one says.

Izminds comment is a  good exampel of the type of retoric I told you about before. ""leftists"", ""refuse to use the term illigal imigrant"", ""noone is illigal as they put it""(I have *never* heard this frase), ""panicking and going on a propaganda offensive"".

There is a reason why we see comments like this on /r/europe and /r/worldnews. He wouldnt get away with claims like these in /r/sweden, amongst people who actually lives in sweden.

Now, I am no expert on finnish politics and such, so I can only give a shallow guess. But I think its easy to say that Izminds summery that ""they just dont want immigrants"" seems a bit too shallow. How about asking *why* they dont want immigrants. I think its for the same reason that SD gets so many votes in sweden. Its not necessarily because people are racist, its because they are populistic parties, they promise easy solutions so all our problems. You first blame every problem in society on immigrants, and then you promise to get rid of the immigrants.

Since the finns doesnt have the same history of immigration as Sweden, mayby they find it easier to belive in these populistic parties.  While In Sweden we have heard the same stuff before, about the italians and turks, and eastern europeans, and with other scandinavian immigrants etc. Mayby the finns lacks this experiance, mayby they are just beeing a bit careful, moving in smaller steps to try and avoid any problems. But as I said, i dont know for sure.

Well you should visit the Prinzipalmarkt. It's a large street in the heart of Münster where you find the town hall as well. Especially in the evening it's a really nice spot. Grab a beer or two at Pinkus down the street (it changes its name to Rothenburg, I think), their brewery is located in the Münsterland. Münster has an interesting history about the Wiedertäufer, some dutch Christians who wanted to rebaptize the whole population. The Stadtmuseum gives you most information about that (if you don't want to join a guided tour ;) ). Sometimes they have interesting photo exhibitions picturing Münster in the 1950s/60s. You might as well visit the Aasee. It's called ""Münsters grüne Lunge"" (Münster's green lung) and it's a really nice lake surrounded by a park-like area. If you are into art you should visit the Picasso- Museum. You can see many of his artwork there. The Castle of Münster isn't far from the city centre and aslo definitely worth a visit. In its backyard there is as well the botanic garden.
Concerning the castles around Münster I'm afraid to disappoint you a bit as I cannot give you any good advice.. The last time I went there was six years ago at the age 12 and at that age it rather annoyed me. Reaching them by bike would be the easiest thing, but I know it's cold during winter in Germany :D As far as I know Burg Vischering (museum presenting middle-age living in Münster) and Schloss Hülshoff (~10km from the city centre; gives impressions of the living of a noble family during the 18./19. century) are the most interesting ones. 
In general the local public transport in Münster is well built-out but I can't give you any information on timetables etc. Sorry about that. 
Well I hope I mentionned everything important, maybe tomorrow, something else crosses my mind then I'll let you know. Otherwise you should check out the tourist information the offer of touristical activities increased during the last years so I lost the overview ;)

Speculative hyperbole with no grounding.  The Germans and nobody else has any claim or power to claim more, so it's not even speculative, it's fantasy which is why the UK not extending the budget is being taken so seriously, along with the other 7 states.

Ironically it is very much in the EZ which is struggling with the debacle which the UK is one step removed, and when Cameron last went to the EU and Sarkozy said 'Non' even to quite mild requests and fair assurances, which were described as fig-leaves in the UK, even though he had to walk away and the opposition posted it as a defeat - his approval rating for a change went considerably up.

This is the thing, everyone is saying the British are creating problems in EU politics. In reality most of the things we have requested are relatively sensible or if its related to powers they do not have a material impact on other EU member states.

A freeze makes logical sense, people shouldn't reject it just because they find the people proposing it disagreeable. I personally think Cameron comes across as a tool most of the time, however by pushing for a freeze rather than a cut he has shown intelligence in recognising the reality of the situation. It makes sense from an economic standpoint. 

As I said before they should also alter the distribution of the budget, but France won't back down on that. Hollande is suffering from low popularity so he needs the support of farmers.

The UK asked to freeze it in real terms, Germany wanted to increase it by 1%, in real terms.  

They want this on top of the UK input having gone up well above 70% since 2009, and that France wants to protect the Common Agricultural Policy from cuts, which it nor the CFP have ever served UK interests, but where the UK has been asked to cut their rebate further.

true,simonask,DENK,Denmark,"&gt; This is the correct answer.

There's *a lot* of aspects that you guys all completely ignore here.

When Latin was the lingua franca, academia was an *extremely* exclusive club, reserved for maybe a few hundred individuals at best per city or country, even in the larger population centers.

A pervasive lingua franca was not only convenient, it was necessary. Dominated by the church, Latin was also a way to stay in power, by controlling access to knowledge through controlling knowledge of the language.

Since then, enlightenment has happened, and democracy has happened. We now consider it important that people in general are able to inform themselves, to get education regardless of socioeconomic background, and to communicate their knowledge to those who do not have it.

The degree I'm currently finishing is unique in that it is taught in Denmark exclusively in Danish (mostly for reasons of tradition), but I'm *still* perfectly aware of international research, and more than half of the texts I'm using are in English. But then again, the other half isn't. They're in Danish, German, or even French (both of which I can only barely read, but never mind that). My degree being taught in Danish certainly has not impaired my ability to interact with non-Danish-speaking researchers and students in the same area.

Meanwhile, about 15% of the Danish population (across all ages and social backgrounds) does not speak English at all. I doubt the other 85% all speak it at an academic level (hint: if people I know in Danish academia are an indication, it's nowhere near that figure for the ""common people"").

There are only good reasons to learn as many languages as possible, preferably at least 1 foreign language fluently (English in most people's case), but eliminating smaller languages as languages of learning and teaching would be *detrimental* to the general availability and approachability of education in a country like Denmark. It would divide society even more into rich and poor, educated and undereducated, along lines of who speaks English well and who doesn't (the same way it's currently the case in countries like India, by the way).

On top of all this, there's something that us North-West European constantly forget: English is not as relevant as we think. Only about a billion people speak it worldwide. Granted, those are also the richest people on the planet, but it notably doesn't include China and South America.

In recent years I go with a group of American friends and speak English all the time.  Now remember, I have a lot of roots over there, being first generation American.  I have more Spanish friends than I can count, I have countless cousins, second cousins, third cousins, etc. that I go out with as well.

true,Dertien1214,EURO,European Union,"&gt; A freeze (above inflation) makes complete sense at this time. There are several countries in the EU having to make several cuts, the UK has also made large cuts. If you could poll EU citizens asking for their contribution to the EU budget to be cut, frozen or increased I think you would find most people would choose to freeze the budget.

The popularity of a certain measure doesn't really matter in a policy discussion in my opinion.

&gt; Particularly since a large amount is being spent on CAP, a programme designed for the 70's not for the modern era.

If this is your main argument for freezing the budget please elaborate on why the CAP is bad. Now you are just assuming we agree(which i do, but many may not).

&gt; Regarding FTT, the UK used the veto and made everything more difficult. So what!? It didn't make sense from a British standpoint, and it doesn't even make sense from an economic standpoint when not done on a global level.

This isn't going to convince anyone. The people that disagree with you on this don't care about the sensibility from an economic perspective. You will need to provide additional arguments to convince them I reckon.

true,LeHomarbiteEstAmour,null,null,"&gt; La nature est pleine de contradictions et l'étude de la nature amène le doute et non la certitude. 

Ras-le-bol de ce genre de clichés.
Le monde naturel est au contraire très cohérent et son étude systématique amène à des résultats vérifiables et prédictibles dont les règles sous-jacentes sont soumises à un doute raisonnable afin de pouvoir être réexaminées si elles ne suffisaient pas à expliquer de nouveaux évènements. 

&gt; Par exemple, tu es à la fois une onde, de la matière et de l'énergie, et on ne peut jamais dire à la fois où l'on se trouve et où l'on va. De la même manière les comportements humains sont contradictoires et dans tous les cas non déterministes, il n'y a pas les gentils qui ont raison d'un côté, et les méchants croyants de l'autre. 

Stylé le parallèle entre les propriétés des particules et les comportements humains.  
""Les découvertes scientifiques heurtent le sens commun, donc elles sont contradictoires, donc les comportement humains sont contradictoires"" - théorème de jrdoublet.  
Ensuite, le coup des gentils qui ont raison d'un côté vs. les méchants croyants, d'une part j'ai jamais dit qu'ils étaient méchants, merci de caricaturer mes propos, d'autre part ça n'a rien à voir avec ce qui précède. La liaison cause-conséquence entre ""les comportements humains ne sont pas soumis à des déterminismes""* et ""deux propositions contradictoires (Dieu existe, ou pas) peuvent être simultanément valides"" n'est pas super claire.  
*affirmation ridicule à la lumière de n'importe quel bouquin de vulgarisation de neurobiologie, soit dit en passant.

&gt; Les gens choisissent tout et n'importe quoi avec ou sans religion. Il faudrait que tu me démontres que dans le même contexte, la même personne aurait adopté un meilleur comportement sans religion. Il y a autant d'exemples de gens qui sont cons en prenant la religion comme prétexte que de gens qui ont/qui pensent être sauvés grâce à la religion. De temps en temps ça marche, de temps en temps ça foire. Le bilan n'est pas négatif.

Allo ? Je répondais, à l'affirmation que la religion défend des valeurs louables, qu'elle ne défendait rien du tout puisqu'elle défend tout et son contraire.  
A priori, donc, on est bien d'accord sur ce point : moralement, avoir une religion, c'est comme avoir rien du tout. Pas mieux, pas pire. Maintenant, la plupart des moralistes modernes ont proposé des systèmes moraux supérieurs à celui du christianisme. Au hasard, Kant. 

&gt; Les réformes et conciles, ça te dit quelque chose ? L'Église passe son temps à changer, par contre elle ne le fait pas sur la même échelle de temps que la politique : un concile prend plusieurs années par exemple. En tout cas, les conceptions du monde chrétiennes ont radicalement changé depuis Constantin.

L'Eglise catholique change quand elle ne peut pas faire autrement, et le reste du temps elle est infaillible. Ça fait partie de la doctrine catholique, et c'est bien parce que la société change que l'Eglise est forcée de suivre le mouvement, pas l'inverse. Dans 30 ans ils s'excuseront pour avoir fait chier au moment de la légalisation du mariage homosexuel, comme ils le font toujours une fois qu'ils sont sûrs de ne plus pouvoir rien y faire. 

&gt; Je vois que nous avons à faire à un expert. Tu mélanges tout et bravo, tu viens de nous apprendre qu'il ne faut pas prendre les textes au sens littéral. Ah merde, ça a déjà été fait par Philo d'Alexandrie, donc avant même Jésus. D'ailleurs c'est pénible, cette histoire des quatre sens de l'écriture, ça oblige à réfléchir et à interpréter les textes.

C'est tellement pratique... je suis sûr qu'avec la bonne interprétation on peut remplacer la bible par le Silmarillon et ça roule.  
Comment peux-tu ne pas voir à quel point c'est friable, mensonger et intéressé, de se laisser la possibilité d'interpréter la parole de Dieu avec n'importe quel degré d'imprécision ? Ça veut concrètement dire qu'on a le droit de faire dire à la bible n'importe quoi. Way to go.

&gt; Pour finir, une pasteurisation : ""Un peu de science éloigne de Dieu, mais beaucoup y ramène.""

Non, toutes les observations indiquent le contraire. La plupart des scientifiques ne sont pas croyants, et depuis la révolution scientifique du XVII° la religion n'a cessé de reculer, par à-coups, en Europe. La phrase est peut-être jolie, mais elle est fausse.  
Et pour finir, argument d'autorité. C'est pas parce que c'est Pasteur qui l'a dit que ça dispense d'argumenter.

Constantly changing policy means that nothing of substance will ever get done. I have no objection to the government establishing space policy to begin with. I just wish that they'd **stick** with that policy.

Private spaceflight is subject to the same problems. If the US decided to decrease its subsidies to private space companies, then they too would have to scale back and change their policy. Maybe instead of making a heavy lift rocket, they have to make a smaller rocket.

I absolutely agree that private spaceflight should exist alongside a public space program. The key word here is alongside.

true,koleye,UNSA,American Europhile,"I'm probably one of the biggest Europhiles here, yet I agree that CAP needs to be reformed and that the Parliament should have a single seat (but that France should probably host a major institution as well). I agree with a financial transaction tax in principle, but I also understand that it provides a disadvantage to the EU when most other countries wouldn't have one. I think it is absolutely necessary for the people who move money around so frequently to shoulder some of the responsibility of market crashes. Perhaps a FTT isn't the best way to do that, but I haven't really heard of many other suggestions.

At the same time, I think the EU budget needs to grow. This is necessary in order to continue providing funding for regions of the EU below 75% of the EU's GDP per capita, administration, etc. We all know the EU's role in Europe's economy and politics is expanding. Like it or not, a larger budget will come with that. Ideally, the EU will begin to do more things that do not need to be done at the member state level, thus freeing up money to go to the EU that otherwise would have gone to national budgets. Indeed, in the years since the last budget was improved, the EU has become significantly more relevant in the European and global economy and political arena.

I can't speak for anyone else other than myself on the issue of Britain. I love the UK, and the reason why I am often outspoken and critical of its policies are because they have historically slowed integration and made issues out of nothing (for example: the current government fought the Commission over a statement made in the UN saying ""It is the policy of the EU..."" because they preferred it to say ""It is the policy of the EU and its member states...""

Britain continues to think of it as an island in the middle of the Atlantic, not quite European, not quite North American. Though this is true to an extent, it is not to the degree that many Brits like to believe. The UK's relationship with the US is not one of parity, and it hasn't been since the Suez Crisis. The US does not view the UK as an equal partner, but as a little, reliable, and close friend. The UK does not have the capacity to help the US achieve its policy goals in Asia, as it isn't a pacific power. Thus, the special relationship will only become less significant in this century.

The point of this diatribe is that I'm disappointed that many Brits have not yet come to terms with the fact that the EU is its future. Sure, countries are going to lose sovereignty to Brussels, but that is really the crux of the Euroskeptic argument. I understand it is a principle of self-determination, and I would respect a British decision to leave the EU, but I would not agree with it. Europe is not complete without the UK, and the UK is not complete without Europe. Europeans have stopped killing each other, but they have not stopped fighting each other. Some fight harder than others, and sometimes those fighting are doing so contrary to their own rational interest.",0,1353381659,null,0,false,0,c740z0r,t3_13h4ts,t1_c740z0r,t1_c73xmbc,null,1430452242,19,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,19
