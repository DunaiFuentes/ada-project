Exemple :
""La reconduction de ce cas de figure apparaît hautement improbable. Les scores obtenus au premier tour de l'élection présidentielle par Marine Le Pen semblent mettre le FN à l'abri d'une telle déconvenue. La présidente du parti d'extrême droite dépasse 25 % des suffrages exprimés dans 59 circonscriptions et 30 % dans trois autres : la 3e du Vaucluse et les 11e - celle de Marine Le Pen - et 12e du Pas-de-Calais.

Sur les 353 circonscriptions où Marine Le Pen dépasse 12,5 % des inscrits, elle arrive en tête dans 23 d'entre elles, et en deuxième position dans 93 autres. Dans certains départements, le Front national devient pratiquement la deuxième force politique. Dans l'Aisne, sa candidate arrive en première position dans deux circonscriptions, et en deuxième position dans deux autres, sur les cinq que compte le département.""

This is a noble way of thinking to keep yourself in the straight road, but an absolutely terrible way to think about how groups of people make decisions. It can be a mental strategy but not an explanation about how society works. My experience is that it is completely futile to think of groups of people as having some sort of free will. It's more accurate to think about them as an object with a million little strings attached, pulling them one way or another depending on the strength each string pulls with.

true,kyr004,CYPR,Cyprus,"Wikipedia does not make any mention of the fable Greek genocide of Turks in Cyprus. I never denied that the Greeks wanted enosis. This is true. But Turkey claims they ""intervened"" to prevent a genocide of the Turkish minority, which never would have happened. 

In the 11 years previous to the invasion, there had been intercommuncal warfare, and people from BOTH sides engaged in violence. There was also Greek-Greek violence and Turk-Turk violence i.e. Greeks killing communist Greeks and the same for the Turks. 

But the desire of Turks for ""Taksim"" had ALWAYS been present, and they had ALWAYS wanted to invade Cyprus. The coup of 74 provided them with an excuse, and an opportunity to act out the invasion, long-planned since 1957. With the military coup of the Greeks, they could justify their action and spread propaganda claims to distort the truth and create lies to tell their people. This is EXACTLY what they did. You want proof? Here it is:

[This video](http://www.britishpathe.com/video/cypriot-turks-march-to-downing-street) shows Turkish extremists demanding partition and Turkish invasion of Cyprus 16 YEARS BEFORE THE INVASION. It was shot in London in 1958. Freeze the video at the 35 second mark and you can even see EXACTLY the long-planned divided lines of invasion which were made 16 years after this video when the Turks invaded and began to occupy the northern part of the island. This had been the plan for many years, ""taksim"", turkish partition, invasion.

From these extremist offshoots sprung the turkish nationalist terrorist group, TMT, who famously engaged in ethnic cleansing of Greeks and even of Turkish people in cyprus. TMT would enter turkish villages, and kill children, framing the Greeks for doing so, even though no greeks had ever stepped into these villages for years. Independent investigations into such murders found NO trace of evidence to show that murders had been done by Greeks. I once engaged in conversation with a Turkish girl from Istanbul, she told me that Greeks ethnically cleansed turkish children and showed me the photo of tmt terorrists killing turkish children. But the turks will NOT BELIEVE the truth, they are adamant that the greeks tried to do genocide in cyprus. It is lies. It was the will of the turkish government to defend their actions by spreading lies like this.

I leave you with a quote from a Turkish Cypriot, Ihsan Ali, who worked for the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation. He said in September 1965:

""I will repeat what I said in the past. The Turkish community is a victim of treason by the Turkish government. The Turkish Cypriots are not victims of the Cypriot government nor of the Greek-Cypriots. Everybody should know that partition has been the desire and proposal of the colonialists.""

I don't know about this idea of a genocide, and you're probably right that it didn't exist. Regardless, it seems that the Turkish intervention was due to the threat posed by the Greek Junta and the Enosis, even if this was just an excuse.

I have visited the TRNC and if I am honest, my main concern is that the people of those lands (eg Turkish Cypriots) need some sort of reconition or protection, be it in a Federal state (such as the Annan Plan for peace which was accepted by the Turks but rejected by the Greeks) or a two state solution.

true,sasp777,null,null,"I'll try refuting the major points made by Michas. 

1. Concerning the public sector. Greece has a small (compared to the rest of Europe, even compared to US) public sector, so what he calls bloated is nonsense. What the left wants is reformation of the public sector, not firing/privatising most of it.  Thus when Michas says the Left is opposed to public reform, he's lying. The left is against privatisations (which might be all that Michas understands as ""reform""). 
As a side comment, it was not the left the caused public sector cronyism.  It inherits it, and it's their big bet to fix it, but this has nothing to do with the nonsense that Michas claims of the Left supporting it (on the opposite, they've been very vocal about it). 
2. His second point is that the Left does not represent the ""industrial proletariat"", but upper middle class interests (Lawyers, doctors, etc) that are over privileged.  Most doctors I know are unemployed or out of Greece. Most Lawyers I know earn 300 Euros per month.  Teachers earn  500. You might claim that they deserve it or whatever, but in no sense are these people upper middle class or ""privileged"".  They are mostly young, over-educated and under-employed. In no way these people ""have been able to grow and flourish under Greece's political system"". 
Now, concerning the real working class/farmers, all my acquaintances in these fields earn from peanuts to nothing, and they can survive on their fathers/mothers/grandmathers/wife's grandmother's pensions. 
3. Concerning the bailout plan, the Left never promised a paradise reneging the austerity plan (or no consequences from the rest of Europe ). It promised it will do whatever it can to renege the plan and stay within Europe. There is no bluff calling or any other nonsense Michas claims. If this fails (but no negotiations have started yet, they haven't even formed a government, they have their own ideas, but they always claimed they will talk to the rest of Europe and see how far they can get), they are ready for an exit (my guess is that they will have to push this through a referendum of some sort).  So Michas is lying again here.

true,kyr004,CYPR,Cyprus,"I am glad you are looking to do more research after this exchange. People need to know the truth about Cyprus. As for myself, let me tell you one thing. In Cyprus, nobody is taught anything about the 1974 invasion. This is not taught in schools, in universities, there is no curriculum to find knowledge of this. The current communist government wants people to forget about it. I don't even live in Cyprus myself an I can tell you that.

Everything I know about Cyprus, I did through my own personal research. My father is a refugee, I have never live in Cyprus, I have lived in England all my life and this has allowed me to access information from objective sources. I have never been taught, not by my father, not by any Greek. I began my research totally objectively, after all I live in an area of London surrounded by Turkish and Greek people and I believe not in racism, simply in the TRUTH. 

Although I am Greek-Cypriot, I never deny the truths said by Turkish Cypriots. I only deny the lies, which I can prove are lies through historical sources. 

So for example, I never deny that EOKA B (who did the military coup) were a threat to the Turks of Cyprus, but I will forever deny that the Greeks were doing genocide. I will forever that the Turkish invasion was a response to the Greek military coup. That is a lie. It was planned for a very long time, and the Turks waited for their chance, for the moment of instability when they could act out their plan. And then they acted out their plan in the most barbaric of ways, with no respect for humankind, raping women inside churches, slaughtering innocent children, killing civilians, making orphans of children, taking hostages and prisoners to concentration camps in Adana, Turkey. The evidence is all there.

There are many examples of lies spread by the Turkish government, which on the surface appear true, but if you do some honest research and really try and find the truth, you will be surprised to see how sinister the Turkish government is in consolidating its lies over Cyprus. I give you just one example:

One of the Turks' strongest claims that the Greeks planned Genocide is based upon the testimony of Martin Packard, who created the worst accusation against the Greek Cypriots that they ""slaughtered 27 Turkish Cypriots in the Nicosia General Hospital in December 1963"". Packard was a British Lieutenant Naval commander who was serving in Cyprus. 

This accusation was made in an article in ""The Guardian"" on 2 April 1988 written by Chief Editor Peter Preston, a good friend of Packard since 1963/64 when both were in Cyprus. 

Martin Packard repeated this accusation in 10 February 1994 in a documentary ""Dead or Alive"" shown on British Tv on Channel 4, which was primarily focused on the fate of the 1619 Greek Cypriots missing since the Turkish Invasion. This is what Martin Packard said:

""The largest single element of these missing people were the Turkish Cypriot patients at the Nicosia General Hospital. Nothing had been heard of any of them, it was assumed that they were being held in custody somewhere. The outcome of my investigation suggested that they had all been killed in the General Hospital. They had been removed at night, the bodies from there had been taken out to outlying farms up in the region of Skiloura and, out there, they had been dismembered and passed through farm dicing machines and they had been seeded into the plough land.""

As emerged 5 years later, this British officer Martin Packard was lying in public feeling free to claim ""his own investigation"" which was never produced. 

Soon after this documentary, a Greek Cypriot woman Fanoulla Argyrou, challenged these accusations and demanded from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office ""access to the relevant documents"" Packard had referred to in his statement, namely some ""relevant documents"" and a ""report"" he had prepared at the time. These relevant documents were NOWHERE TO BE SEEN.

After 5 years of intense persistence and after extending this line of enquiry to the Ministry of Defense, the Foreign Minister came up with the answer that ""those papers did not exist"". On 3 May 1999 another article appeared in The Guardian (also written by Packard's good friend and Chief Editor Peter Preston) to WITHDRAW THOSE UNJUST ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THE GREEK CYPRIOTS. 

The main fact that surfaced after this second article, is that British Lt. Commander Martin Packard had actually NO EVIDENCE whatsoever for his allegations against the Greek Cypriots.

But look!!! This is what I am saying!!! Here we have some piece of opinion clearly seen as a lie and withdrawn as false by the newspaper, but the Turks STILL USE THIS LIE AS EVIDENCE AGAINST THE GREEKS. Evidence as to how much the Turks used the injustified Packard allegations as a front line tool to support their Invasion of 74 is confirmed by peter Preston himself (!!) in the same very article:

""A few weeks ago, Turkey's UN ambassador in a letter to Kofi Annan (then secretary general of the UN) cited the story of the 27 patients as evidence of Greek Cypriot ethnic cleansing, which made Ankara's invasion and the dismemberment of Cyprus inescapable"". 

Top Secret documents entitled ""Operations in Cyprus, December 1963 - February 1964"" and classified ""for UK eyes only"" released into UK archives 30 years later, make NO MENTION IF ANY SUCH MASSACRE.

These are LIES which are exploited by the Turks to make their hideous crimes against humanity justified.

As for the Turkish Cypriots, it is very clear that they do not want a solution!!! You can say whatever you want about international recognition, but to achieve this they need to surrender Cyprus from terrorist hands!

Look at what is happening in Cyprus, do you even know? They voted a NATIONALIST leader Eroglu who has NO intention of solving the issue. For 18 months the Greek cypriots have been trying hard to push for a solution but Eroglu does everything in his power to avoid talks and discussion!!!

Eroglu is a person who wants to maintain the current status quo. It seems like you need to do a lot more learning about Cyprus to uncover the truth.

Worum es dieser Gruppe ""offensichtlich"" geht oder nicht, ist eine Interpretation und hat nichts mit dem objektiven Tatbestand zu tun.
Wenn ich dieser Gruppe nun verböte, Karikaturen zu zeigen, für die unsere Regierungschefin noch vor kurzem einen Medienpreis vergeben hat, beugt sich der Rechtsstaat der Gewaltdrohung einer extremistischen Minderheit. 

Um nun auf Zeile 3-4 ihres Posts zurück zu kommen: Wie kann also eine Mohammed Karikatur in einem Kontext durch den Staat verboten werden, in einem anderen jedoch nicht? Es hört sich für mich so ein bischen nach einer Argumentationslinie an, die man für die Haltung gefährlicher Wildtiere nutzen könnte: ""Bitte die Löwen nicht durch laute Musik reizen!"" (o.s.ä.). Der Unterschied ist nur der, dass Moslems keine Tiere und Islamismus keine Naturgewalt ist. Diese Leute sind Menschen, ggf. Bürger unseres Landes und unterliegen daher wie alle unserer Rechtsordnung. Ich sehe nicht ein, warum hier ein anderer Maßstab angelegt werden soll als an jeden anderen?

Zum Kontext: ich weiß fast nichts über Pro NRW außer, dass einige dieser Leute Verbindungen zum Rechtsextremismus haben sollen. Dies ist jedoch m.E. im konkreten Fall belanglos. Es überrascht mich daher die häufig anzutreffende Apologetik dieser inakzeptablen Gewaltausbrüche aufgrund harmloser Plakate mit dem Verweis darauf, dass die ProNRW Leute ja Nazis, Extremisten, Spinner und ""Islamhasser"" seien (insebsondere aus dem Umfeld der sog. ""Linken"" die hier ja scheinbar ihre neue Liebe zur Religion entdeckt haben?!).

true,WalkerEU,CYPR,Cyprus,"tl;dr of the article and comments on that link: The real reason there is peace is because Germany got their heads kicked in and America is our protector. The EU is not needed and should not try to officially become the largest economy in the world, because the US is the only country that should be like that -- oh and vote UKIP for independence so we can stick it to the US right after we destroy the EU!

Pretty soon if the EU doesn't start being destroyed, the UK is gonna have to insist that Turkey joins so that they can then point fingers and say ""You see dudes? We're totally different, we can't be together -- FAILED PROJECT!!"" 

What merkel and the EC president van gollum were quoting as saying are very valid statements.

A greek friend on /r/europe yesterday mentioned during one of his rages against brits that the UK doesn't understand why people love the EU.. they love it because they are not one of the largest military forces on the planet -- the UK more than likely can survive alone.. other countries do get and will continue to be bullied by countries such as Turkey, who you think would make excellent partners, but in reality are a country which worries lots of countries in the region who want to make sure they are part of the EU for protection.

With or without the EU, the UK will be heard and respected.. the same cannot be said for other countries. European integration has been working and more of it is welcome.. we've just hit a bump on the road and need to fix it -- it's quite obvious the way things currently are is pretty crappy.. the eurozone isn't working because there is no fiscal/political union? How is the angle of 'bring on the fiscal/political union' any less correct than 'disband the whole bloody lot'.. if the UK doesn't want part in such advancement, you are free to leave the union... but do not try to bring it down with you because of jealousy/doing america's bidding/racism. If the EU falls apart, France and Germany will probably form their own alliance which will make them a much bigger player than the UK _anyway_.. why don't we think about the future? Nationalism _does_ lead to war one way or another.. it doesn't mean that the UK will be involved in any of it -- but there are many more countries in Europe/EU than just the UK, France, Germany, Italy.. perhaps they are not as wise/intelligent as the brits and will start slaughtering eachother.. do they not also deserve peace?

Classic example right here.. Cyprus vs Turkey... look at the sheer size of Turkey compared to Cyprus.. Cyprus is completely insignificant. If it were not due to Greece and the EU, the Turks would have likely annexed the entire island by now. The UK doesn't have this danger.. only a complete fool would try to attack them.. but Cyprus? you could probably take the country over with a squad of squirrels and a couple of bazookas.

What a populist cock this guy is. First of all.. HOW is May 8th to be celebrated if only ""half the continent"" got democracy *back* (implying that the British Empire had anything to do with democracy^1 is just purely laughable, but that's a different topic)? Because fuck Eastern Europe that's why. Compared to what happened to Europe after the war the EU is definitely a bigger success.

Second of all if we were to celebrate the Victory Day we should celebrate ""Communism"" (something that never happened in Europe, it was Soviet Imperialism, puppet-totalitarian state isolationism but that is also another discussion) because without the Red Army defeating the Nazis Great Britain would be a very different place now. Hard to comprehend with all the American history twisting and rewriting, but we as Europeans should know better than that.

Third, Yugoslavia wasn't trying to ""abolish nations so no wars would happen"". That is a true **intellectual fart** and clearly comes from a person who has absolutely no knowledge of South-Eastern European history AT ALL.

I am no historian nor am I a sociologist or lawyer, yet I will opine on topics that require advanced degrees in all three.  

In America, during most of the 19th and much of the 20th centuries, a person could pack up, move to another place and establish themselves, without too much fuss and bother.  There are plenty of stories, real and semi-folkloric about people being dastardly criminals in one part of the country, moving (West, mostly) and setting up as respectable citizens in their new town.

There are also stories of opportunists coming in to town and swindling the poor local folk as well (Carpetbaggers in general, or see the musical *The Music Man* for a more entertaining twist).  

Hence the idea of being able to, in the modern parlance, ""re-invent yourself"".  

Bankruptcy, as it exists in America allows one to financially move on, pay back what can be paid back, live with bad marks for ten years, and then, if they have behaved themselves, the old (bad) financial history gets swept away.

My opinion is we have that set of laws, because we have the cultural memory of being able to have a ""do-over"".

My impression of Europe (take with a grain of salt-remember the horrid public school system here) is that everyone hates everyone else, and pretty much has, as far back as anyone can remember.  Every country has been either the center of a vast empire, or been the subjugated territory of a huge empire at one point or another, so if you want a reason to hate your neighbor, there are plenty of excuses.

Copy of the text:

&gt;ATHENS—Two years after Europe bailed Greece out to protect the euro, the rescue has become a debacle that threatens to unravel the common currency.

&gt;After Greece's May 6 elections left pro-bailout parties too weakened to govern the country, more elections are likely in June, with no guarantee a stable government will emerge. By next month, Athens must identify €11.5 billion, or $15 billion, in fresh spending cuts or face suspension of the international loans it needs to pay pensions and run schools. If it doesn't get the money, it would eventually have to print its own.

&gt;Greece's growing turmoil is the culmination of a radical austerity experiment and botched economic overhaul that have pushed the nation to the brink of social and political breakdown. The story of the ill-fated bailout suggests that forcing deep austerity on individual member states won't save the euro and may worsen its crisis.

&gt;Above all, Greece's example illustrates the conflict between Germany's tough terms for aiding other euro members and the amount of pain other societies can bear. Greece's fate shows that what it takes to sell bailouts to a skeptical German public can be politically calamitous in Europe's indebted south.

&gt;""The program is suicidal, not only for Greece but for the euro,"" says Louka Katseli, a former Greek economy minister. ""In Spain, Portugal, Italy—everywhere, the same mistake is being made,"" she says, referring to the European Union's insistence on slashing spending in a recession.

&gt;Germany reiterated on Wednesday that Greece needs to stick to its austerity promises; euro-zone governments decided on Wednesday to postpone part of Greece's next aid payment as a warning to Greek politicians.

&gt;Greece's bailout by the EU and International Monetary Fund is the costliest financial rescue of a nation in history, with paid or pledged loans totaling €245 billion. It has already involved the biggest-ever sovereign-debt default, a debt restructuring that wiped out more than €100 billion of Greek bond debt.

&gt;Yet the restructuring left Greece with two mountains to climb: curbing a still-rising debt more than 1.5 times the size of its economy, while forcing down wages and prices to make the country competitive.

&gt;Straining to keep Greece afloat, the EU and IMF doubled their bet in March, greatly expanding the loan program despite the country's deepening political paralysis.

&gt;Responsibility for the mess, many of those involved in the effort say, lies with a Greek political class that couldn't or wouldn't reform the country, an unrealistic program that assumed a quick economic recovery despite draconian austerity and crushing debts, and growing mistrust between Greece and its creditors.

&gt;""It was almost a mission impossible,"" says George Papandreou, the luckless Greek premier who negotiated the original bailout and then was forced out by a party revolt last fall.

&gt;Mr. Papandreou says that when he asked German Chancellor Angela Merkel for gentler conditions in 2010, she replied that the aid program had to hurt. ""We want to make sure nobody else will want this,"" Ms. Merkel told him.

&gt;Greece's economy has already shrunk by 14% in the past three years, and IMF officials privately expect a further 6.5% contraction this year. Something has to give, and it could be the boundaries of the euro.

&gt;Europe fears that a Greek exit from the euro could spur massive capital flight from Portugal, Spain or other struggling euro members. Some European officials argue privately that the euro could cope with a Greek exit because markets understand that Greece's debt crisis is uniquely severe.

&gt;Others worry that by triggering runs on banks and government-bond markets it could endanger the currency itself. That would present Germany and Europe's north with a terrible choice: to watch the centerpiece of Europe's decades of political integration collapse or to rush into a deeper fiscal union, including common bond issuance, to save the euro.

&gt;When the IMF and European countries banded together in May of 2010 to offer Greece a €110 billion rescue, leaders believed they had acted boldly to avoid calamity.

&gt;The deal required Greece to get a grip on public spending and tax collection while revamping a bloated bureaucracy and jungle of laws that had rendered its economy internationally uncompetitive.

&gt;While everyone accepted that Greece needed fiscal retrenchment, the IMF argued for giving structural changes priority and making the spending cuts gradual, to protect the economy.

&gt;Germany said no: Structural reforms would take place at the same time as drastic austerity to bring down the budget deficit—15.8% of gross domestic product in 2009—to under 3% by 2014. The timetable proved unrealistic: Spending cuts and tax increases pushed the economy into such a deep recession that the deficit got stuck at around 10% of GDP.

&gt;Usually when the IMF imposes austerity, it makes a country devalue its currency, in the hope its cheaper exports will offset falling domestic demand. But Greece no longer has a currency of its own to devalue. Its downward spiral bears increasing resemblance to Argentina's a decade ago. Argentina tried to maintain a fixed exchange rate to the dollar even as IMF austerity drove it deeper into recession, ending in social unrest and political breakdown.

&gt;From the start, Greece's surfeit of debt undermined its chances. Mr. Papandreou's financial adviser, Lazard Ltd., told him the country's bond debts were unsustainable and needed restructuring.

&gt;The head of the IMF at the time, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, was open to it. But Europe wasn't. France and the European Central Bank feared that a Greek default, even via a negotiated restructuring of bonds, would undermine trust in other euro members' debt. Germany thought debt forgiveness would relax the pressure on Athens to make other changes.

&gt;""I'd like to cut my debt in half too,"" Ms. Merkel told Mr. Papandreou during a meeting at the Berlin chancellery, according to the Greek premier.

true,Naurgul,null,null,"    The rest of it:

&gt;Despite Greece's concerns over the plan, its efforts to change began strongly. Polls showed solid public support for taming bureaucracy, corruption and tax evasion, and scrapping the privileges various interest groups had won over the years. Lawyers, taxi drivers, railroad employees and many other groups enjoyed protection from competition or special tax or pension perks, creating cartels and waste.

&gt;Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou attacked the budget deficit. Sharp spending cuts and tax boosts brought the deficit down to 10.6% of GDP in 2010. But change quickly fell victim to party politics.

&gt;Firebrand opposition leader Antonis Samaras, head of the conservative New Democracy party, denounced the tough bailout terms and declared that local elections in November 2010 were a referendum on the ruling Socialist party, known as Pasok. Mr. Papandreou called on Greeks to back him or sack him. Pasok won the elections, but by a much smaller margin than before.

&gt;""Voter fatigue was obvious,"" says Haris Pamboukis, a cabinet member at the time.

&gt;Mr. Papaconstantinou found himself increasingly isolated in cabinet. The U.K.-trained economist was an outsider in Greek politics. He couldn't get other ministers to shut loss-making state industries and pointless army bases, or to ax thousands of civil-service jobs created in return for votes. Nor could he reduce Greece's chronic tax evasion, abetted by corruption among tax inspectors.

&gt;He did what he could: cutting pensions and public-sector pay, while raising sales taxes. But that sapped consumer spending. Shops and small businesses failed. Unemployment surged. Public hostility grew.

&gt;Civil servants facing pay cuts went on strike, including at the finance ministry. ""It was a case of 'you pretend to pay me, I pretend to work,' "" one minister says.

&gt;In spring 2011, austerity and collapsing business and consumer confidence pushed the economy into free fall. Protests rocked the center of Athens. There wasn't enough support in Parliament to pass the next set of austerity measures.

&gt;In June, Mr. Papandreou replaced his finance minister with the premier's biggest rival, Evangelos Venizelos. Europe's ebbing trust in Greece soon plunged.

&gt;Mr. Venizelos, who has been described as one of the most eloquent Greek orators since ancient times, took the finance job reluctantly, fretting that the unpopular task could destroy his political ambitions, colleagues at the time say.

&gt;Many Greeks hoped he would be a tough negotiator with Europe and the IMF. Mr. Venizelos's first foray was at a finance ministers' meeting in Luxembourg. His long speech hit all the wrong notes.

&gt;He told his euro-zone peers they needed to relax Greece's austerity targets, citing the growing political difficulties. He called privatization goals unrealistic and blamed EU law for making asset sales complicated. He suggested Europe had no choice but to lend more money because a Greek bankruptcy could destabilize the euro zone. Greece's crisis ""is a European problem,"" he said.

&gt;Other ministers reacted with fury. To them, it sounded as if he was trying shirk hard decisions while blackmailing his creditors. They lambasted Mr. Venizelos until 2 a.m., saying Greece had to rebuild its credibility before it got any more aid.

&gt;Instead of releasing a quarterly loan payment as planned, the ministers put it on ice until Athens enacted more austerity.

&gt;As the meeting ended, the bruised Mr. Venizelos tried once more to secure the money, to allow him a political victory at home. ""I'm here for the first time,"" he pleaded, according to people who heard him. ""It would be a bad signal if the tranche is not released."" Jan Kees de Jager, the equally burly Dutch finance minister, erupted in anger.

&gt;Part of the government's problem, Europe knew, was that Mr. Samaras was assailing the austerity measures, and his conservatives had overtaken Pasok in opinion polls as a result.

&gt;Ms. Merkel and other heads of European conservative parties summoned Mr. Samaras to Brussels on June 23. For three hours, they pressed him to back the program. Mr. Samaras told them the program would fail. ""Then you will need a plan B, and I'm the one who can bring it about,"" he said.

&gt;Ms. Merkel asked Mr. Samaras what he proposed. He said he agreed with cutting the budget deficit—but he wanted to do it by cutting taxes to spur the economy.

&gt;A tax cut would create a bigger budget shortfall, other conservative leaders said. Only Viktor Orban, Hungary's maverick premier, sided with Mr. Samaras. ""Some understand that we are right,"" the unbending Mr. Samaras told reporters after the meeting.

&gt;Mr. Venizelos tried again to force a relaxation of the bailout terms in September. At nighttime talks in his finance ministry, inspectors from the EU and IMF pressed him to lay off civil servants and shut loss-making state enterprises.

&gt;Mr. Venizelos refused. ""I don't want to enter into a technical discussion with you. The issue is political,"" he said, according to people present. (Mr. Venizelos didn't return messages requesting comment.) The inspectors told him they couldn't offer any political concessions, and left town without recommending the release of Greece's next slice of aid.

&gt;The finance ministry had less than €1 billion left in its coffers. The monthly bill for public wages and pensions was around four times that. Greece's government avoided bankruptcy only by not paying its suppliers.

&gt;Mr. Venizelos had to appeal again to European finance ministers, who met in Wroclaw, Poland, in mid-September. The night before the meeting, Germany's Wolfgang Schäuble collared Mr. Venizelos in their hotel's cellar bar and made it clear over a bottle of fine wine that Europe was getting fed up with Greece.

&gt;""If you want to stay in the euro, you have to act,"" Mr. Schäuble said.

&gt;Greece did want to stay in the euro, Mr. Venizelos said.

&gt;Mr. Venizelos became more cooperative, euro-zone officials say. But the Greek program was badly off track. The government had made little headway on its long list of promised changes to reduce red tape, increase competition and attract investment.

&gt;In October, the IMF, now under the more stringent leadership of former French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde, forced Europe to recognize reality: The numbers didn't add up.

&gt;That forced European leaders to grant Athens debt relief. An EU summit on Oct. 26 led eventually to a 53.5% ""haircut"" in Greece's bond debt, coupled with more aid loans. But by this time most of Greece's debt was owed to euro-zone authorities and the IMF, rather than to private bondholders. A bond restructuring that could have worked at the outset had a limited effect: Greece's debt fell from €356 billion in 2011 to a projected €327 billion this year.

&gt;Ms. Merkel and other euro-zone leaders thought the haircut-and-new-loans deal had settled the Greek question. But in Athens, the government was falling apart.

&gt;Amid rising social unrest and fraying support in parliament, Mr. Papandreou proposed a referendum on the expanded bailout.

&gt;Ms. Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy, angered by Greece's unpredictability, told the Greek premier in the French Riviera resort of Cannes on Nov. 2 that the referendum should make the choice facing Greeks clear: Implement the bailout program or leave the euro. He agreed.

&gt;On the government plane home that night, Mr. Papandreou suggested getting some sleep and rolled onto his side. Mr. Venizelos stayed awake, took out a sheet of paper and scribbled a news release denouncing the referendum. ""Greece's position within the euro area is a historic conquest…that cannot be put in doubt,"" he wrote. On landing in Athens at 4:45 a.m., he released the statement without informing Mr. Papandreou.

&gt;Lawmakers close to Mr. Venizelos came out against Mr. Papandreou. His referendum and his majority were history. He resigned days later.

&gt;Euro-zone leaders' open talk of expelling Greece shocked the country. Consumer and business spending nearly came to a halt. Savers queued at banks to take their cash home.

&gt;Mr. Samaras, too, was shocked. After months of denouncing the program, he joined a bipartisan coalition supporting it. Messrs. Samaras and Venizelos became reluctant partners, propping up a new prime minister, former central banker Lucas Papademos.

&gt;But Mr. Papademos, a cautious former ECB board member, lacked the political clout to push the overhaul of Greece's economy and state through a reluctant Parliament. Instead, most reforms were on ice until the May elections.

&gt;It was Mr. Samaras who insisted on holding early elections. He rejected Pasok's entreaties to let Mr. Papademos govern until the parliamentary term ended in late 2013. Mr. Samaras was confident his New Democracy party could win. His advisers didn't believe the opinion polls, which showed collapsing support for both major parties—his and Pasok—and rising votes for Communists, neo-Nazis and other radical groups.

&gt;On May 6, New Democracy and Pasok fared even worse than opinion polls suggested. The nation blames the two established parties for getting Greece into a debt crisis, and for destroying it in the attempt to escape.",0,1336604097,null,0,false,0,c4m5xqw,t3_tfhbk,t1_c4m5xqw,t1_c4m5xf3,null,1428892527,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

Wow, talk about condescending (apologies if I misinterpreted this, but it sure comes across this way).  I wasn't aware that picking up a basic ability to communicate in a foreign language constitutes being a ""linguist"".

It trivializes those of us who worked hard at learning foreign languages when we moved abroad so that we might better fit in.

&gt; some people just can't do it anymore.

I'm sorry, but I refuse to believe that it is not possible for someone who takes the massive step of moving to another country, regardless of their socioeconomic circumstances, to gain a functional command of grammar and vocabulary.  It's ridiculous.  ""Racism and discrimination"" has nothing to do with it and accusing people who don't tolerate an unwillingness to integrate of the above demeans and devalues these important terms.  As you can tell from the article that you no doubt read, there's enough evil abuse of immigrants here (often by other immigrants).

I certainly hope that you're not one of those people who cries ""racism!"" whenever they see someone with tough expectations of immigrants to a country with a strong social system based on a willingness to follow the rules, adapt, and contribute.

_Edit:_ For what it's worth, I like immigration.  It is a good thing.  People coming to another country to adapt and work (which incidentally does _not_ mean the same thing as giving up their culture and religion) is a healthy phenomenon.  Especially Europe needs it.  Immigrants also ""takin' er jerbs"".  A lot of immigrants do shit work that locals won't take.  This is a good thing for everyone.  But to turn a blind eye to opportunistic immigration by people who are not willing to contribute and adapt, simply because their host system is ""rich"" and oh, we'll see when we get there, is naive.",0,1336610139,null,0,true,0,c4m76jd,t3_tem1k,t1_c4m76jd,t1_c4m5pll,null,1428893178,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

This includes center-left/pro Europe [D66](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democrats_66) and left-wing/green party [GroenLinks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GroenLinks), who would [never](http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http://www.d66.nl/d66nl/nieuws/20120508/vvd_cda_brengen_drugs_bij_u_in_de?ctx=vghpm7u9vdea) back such measures. Not a single word was said about this wietpas project in the deal that was made and my projection is that if a government is formed (after the elections this fall) without the PVV, which is exceptionally likely, the law will probably be turned back,",0,1336641033,null,0,false,0,c4mcbd3,t3_tehl2,t1_c4mcbd3,t1_c4mc3ua,null,1428895600,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Only, the continuing austerity through the second dip of recession is not really wise, and it seems to me the bluebonds system would possibly have a more powerfull incentive for keeping the debt levels in check than the current situation.

First, because the costs of over-indebtetness would rise more sharply though starting from a lower base, and at some point would overtake the cost of having all that debt only nationally.

Second, since it would give the comission or council or whatever international body votes on the allowed eurobond levels a pretty powerfull way of penalizing economies for not following whatever recommendations or demands came out of the european semester proces, without resorting to outright fines.

Third, because less debt would be threatened by a fiscal collapse, such bancrupcies, depending on the size of the country, might possibly be simply allowed to happen w/o as much risk for euro stability - and hence not giving a bailout to someone would be a more credible alternative.

And ofc esp for smaller economies, just being alowed to enter the system might be an extra incentive for prudent fiscal management (depending on the conditions of joining), over the medium term.",0,1336647705,null,0,true,0,c4mct02,t3_tg3zw,t1_c4mct02,t1_c4mcknz,null,1428895827,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

one - the demise of the FDP does not correlate with classical liberalism becoming obsolete/ being surpassed by other 'movements'. what is happening to the FDP is a story of insanely bad internal management decisions, irrational policy decisions and bad press/PR in general (i'm saying this as a former member of that party, and i'm starting to get angry when i think about it). at a more general level, i feel that this has also to do with a lack of visible intellectuals in the party, as well as a general lack of interest to engage the issues of the day in public policy discourse. 

two - concerning classical liberalism in the german society / in german politics: it has definitely taken a few hits during the economic crisis and parties like the CDU and FDP are partly to blame for that, because they have not been able (at least in my opinion) to differentiate between the market-centric approach of liberalism (classical liberalism is often lumped together with neo-liberalism) and what i would call civic liberalism, i.e. the notion that individual freedom and self-determination are at least co-equal to economic freedom.

Which says that ""Recent studies have recognised that certain aspects of SLA may be affected by age, though others remain intact"".   Nowhere either in that abstract or in the wikipedia article do I see any mention of it being impossible, or even improbably difficult, for even an older person to pick up at a basic, functioning command of a second language.

Furthermore, maybe it's mean.  Fine.  I'm a mean person.  And I'm sure according to someone's definition, it's unfair.  Life's not fair.  You move elsewhere for opportunity?  You follow the rules, you learn to adapt.  You want the opportunity and the benefits?  You learn the rules.  That sounds like a pretty fair deal to me.

I have a problem with a well-fed-looking 30-something Polish bum coming up to me in my local Rewe in Germany and pointing to himself saying ""Polska...Polska"", then holding up a finger and saying ""one Euro"" (in English).  At the same time, our painter and our plumber, both 50-odd, while they speak pretty shitty German, can communicate, work more than many Germans I know, and want to be successful and good at what they do.  They pay taxes, they contribute, and even if they fail, they've worked hard at least at trying.  The same for the Moroccan dudes who ran the corner grocery near where I used to live in Paris, and the Vietnamese guy who brings delivery sometimes.  And In my humble, limited experience, these are vastly more representative of immigrants than the former.  Countries like Germany should have people running around with baskets of blank passports, giving them to these guys and smiling ""welcome to Germany!"".

Hubris because spending billions of dollars on hiring contractors to run a sporting event is the most idiotic source of ""pride"" that I can imagine; anyone with the ability to borrow billions of dollars can do this with equal facility. The only distinguishing factor from one country to the next is the vendor-selection process, hardly the stuff of national greatness.

Venality because with that much money at stake there's no way an awful lot of it isn't going missing. Any politician who supports an olympic bid is automatically on my ""don't vote for this crook"" list.

I think we need to work hard to make sure more people see it the same way. If signing one's country up for this criminal sham was guaranteed to be the death of someone's political career, maybe at least they'd think twice about it.

Oh gosh! You are still thinking that lenders' (I think you mean) confidence is the main problem. Well, if that was the case, how would crashing the economy with austerity help lender's confidence? 

The main problem is that the costs are too high. If your export is suffering because the costs (mostly wages) in your country are too high, devaluing the currency reduces the cost of everything you export. Better trading balance leads to better general economy which means that you have a better chance to repay your loans.

Naturally, you can blame the immigrants but look at it this way - Germany invited Gastarbeiter but did little to integrate them. ""Yay, free workforce!

you could head to the Wartburg castle (near Eisennach) where Martin Luther translated the bible from Latin to German. A mayor step for the development of the Protestant Christian church.

Sadly they recently shut down the winter sports museum there due to lack of qualified personal and financing.

Close to Oberhof is the city of Suhl which is renown for its manufactury of hunting rifles where each rifle is still handmade. There's also a museum dedicated to that.

There's Weimar, the once democratic capital city of Germany, before it surrendered itself to Nazism. While said to be very cultural, in my opinion the city is actually quite boring.

I think the reason why one can say the Germans didn't want to leave the DM is because, being a parliamentary democracy, the politicians never bothered convincing the people. That has been the case more than once, even when the decisions made were in the citizens' interests. That said, I can believe that there were a small group of politicians who knew exactly what they were getting us into with the Euro and a much larger group that was rather clueless. And that first group wasn't much into the ""convincing"" business and more into accomplishing facts. That mode of operations might have worked till now, but it certainly won't work any more.

And, of course, one of the things that needs to be accepted is that any community is a transfer union of some sort. There are always people who pay more in than they get out.

&gt; Nobody's gonna watch your fingers while you eat...

Sure, people notice how you eat. This is cultural stuff and of course you won't get shot for eating with your hands (common in India) but if you don't want to give offense (always a good idea if you are a guest ...) you shouldn't do it in Germany.

&gt; It's not necessary, really, but is appreciated nevertheless.

Culture is always optional so none of this is strictly necessary. However it is customary to bring a little present (usually some form of booze). Not when you hang out with someone regularly, obviously. But if you go over to someones house for dinner for example.

&gt; make you sit down

sigh. You really don't understand what culture is, do you? ... waiting till everyone is done is considered polite and not doing so is impolite. If you don't mind coming off as rude (and being treated accordingly) you can do everything you want!

&gt; Never call a german after 10PM...? Er, now it's getting outright ridiculous.

unless you know they are okay with it, naturally. But lot's of people go to sleep between ten and twelve and it is rude to wake someone up with a phone call.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Anecdotal evidence is fine when it comes to rare phenomena

Oh, so immigrants who manage to teach themselves a functional command of their host country's language are a ""rare phenomenon""?

If I were an immigrant I would find that extremely insulting.  And you'll also pardon the expression, but I don't think I'm the one talking out of my ass here.  You are making an [appeal to authority](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority), a common rhetorical / logical fallacy.  No offense intended, that's really what we call it.  Trust me, imma master debater.

&gt; Germany invited Gastarbeiter but did little to integrate them.

That was in the 1950s and 1960s.  These people have by and large managed to adapt.  The Turks and Spaniards and Portuguese and Italians who came to run the factories of Northern Europe in the post-WWII boom have stayed and integrated, and the German state governments have actually been pressuring them to take German citizenship since the early 2000s.  The ones who ended up unemployed usually had the choice to accept a Rückkehrprämie, a pretty sizable chunk of cash as a bonus for going back.  I really really do not see the issue there.

&gt; if you don't want immigrant who cannot speak the language to come to your country,

I want them to come.  I want them to also be willing to make an effort to learn the language.  Most did.  It is the recent wave of Schengen migrants to Germany, Switzerland, France, Austria, the Netherlands, etc. that is at issue here.

&gt; don't offer them jobs/housing/whatever else. 

I'm not.  That's kind of the point.  Schengen says they have the right to move anywhere within the treaty area.  That is fine.  And most of these countries offer migrants some sort of basic social existence help, which, given that you have this unrestricted bunch of people moving in perfectly legally, is a sensible thing to do if you do not want people unable or unwilling to work (due to cultural or language issues, e.g. many Roma in France) to turn completely to crime.  Compared to France, the Germans have actually done a pretty amazing deal integrating recent arrivals, and the French situation is more due to the shitty centralized education system and the hare-brained restrictions on employment than anything else.

&gt; provide them with possibilities to learn the language. 

[We still talking about Germany here?](http://www.zeit.de/2010/25/DOS-Deutschstunde)  This goes to the point that there is actually a political _debate_ (also known as ""mindfuck"") about the possibility of reducing social assistance to immigrants who flat-out refuse to take a German course.

As for the inflation part, sure, inflation encourages investments and not keeping the money stopped around, but it devalues the currency and makes the whole economy more worthless, unless those are some good investments, inflation is just delaying the issue. Specially when it's inflation to pay off debts, sure, the debt comes down, but so does everyone's net-worth, it's one of those cases where the medicine can be worse than the disease it's meant to cure.",0,1336676468,null,0,false,0,c4mi34n,t3_tgill,t1_c4mi34n,t1_c4mhk4b,null,1428898384,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

In this specific case, article 222-33 does not exist, so the question is moot. (Or do you mean article R-222-33 since 222-33 is the usual shortened version of L-222-33? Do you know the difference?)

But I can still answer, since in general, these would be **separate articles.** We try to keep individual articles short, even if there are exceptions, notably whenever listing aggravating circumstances. This leads to splitting articles when the law evolves. For example, there is an article (L-)222-33-2-1!

If you need to refer more precisely to an inside part of an article, you can use numbered paragraphs, alinea, or items in the list, or even better, quote the specific sentence.

There are a bunch of left people/communists that are seen as the start of the worker's rights, and generally the social welfare that we have the chance to have.

Older than that, some kings/emperors have somehow a reputation (good or bad), but it's not used as a current model at all of course. Some leaders at the revolution are in that case, and generally a bit controversial given the free violence that followed.

Within the 5th republic (so from De Gaulle), it's more controversial. If you ask a socialist, he will say that Mitterrand was great, while a liberal will say the opposite. Same goes with the others but the other way around.

In the current politicians, none of them are nationally respected I guess. Some are more popular than others, but nothing like the image of De Gaulle or Washington in the US.

I mean, what the hell can you say? They were basically paying in 2-3% of their salary for thirty years, and then receiving back 66% of their salary for however long they live after 50, which you'd expect to be about 25 years. That is genuinely insane.

Et bien ça c'est idiot. J'ai voté Melenchon car je l'ai trouvé bon sur les points que je connais bien.

De plus j'ai été attiré par l'idée qu'il fallait punir les responsable de la mise en place de la crise plutôt que de les récompenser. La mise à la tête de la BCE du cadre de Goldman Sachs responsable de la falsification des comptes Grecs m'a révolté. Qu'un mec de la même banque prenne la tête de l'Italie me sidère. Qui d'autre parle d'attaquer la mafia financière ? M. ""I'm not dangerous"" Hollande ? M. ""il faut faire des subprimes en France"" Sarkozy ? 

J'avais l'impression avant de découvrir Mélenchon être le seul loufoque à considérer que si on demande aux Grecs de se serrer la ceinture parce que leur gouvernement a merdé, c'était normal de punir la classe politique et les responsables de structures privées qui les avaient aidés.

Pour quelqu'un qui sait faire des additions et qui prend pas ses électeurs pour des imbéciles. Qui explique, qui argumente.

On lui pose des questions difficiles. On lui demande d'où il tient ses chiffres, d'où il pense pouvoir trouver les ressources nécessaires pour son programme. Il y répond, et le tout semble se tenir. C'est très audacieux, et c'est un projet de société, deux choses qu'on n'a plus l'habitude de voir en politique. 

Enfin, j'ai aussi voté pour lui car je lui trouve un ton gaulliste. Il aime la France, il répète qu'elle est plus grande et puissante qu'elle ne s'imagine, qu'elle s'enferre dans des faux problèmes. Il lui donne sa dimension internationale. Qui d'autre rappelle dans ses discours qu'il s'agit de la deuxième nation maritime au monde (en terme de surface maritime) ?

Taxes create deadweight loss but they can be controlled and adjusted, they don't affect everyone. Inflation, on the other hand, is straight up making everyone poorer.

The logic behind inflation is promoting investments and getting the economy back on tracks, the problem is we are not investing not because of lack of incentive but rather because lack of credit.

An increase in inflation now will hardly help us in creating growth but it will definitely hurt our purchasing power, if we are to make this decision, we definitely have to consider it, I for one am very skeptical about this, knowing how politicians work, it just seems they're trying to delay the issue with inflation rather than tackle it head on which is stopping the debts from accumulating even further.",0,1336700848,null,0,true,0,c4mn8y1,t3_tgi0l,t1_c4mn8y1,t1_c4mn14c,null,1428900894,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

No, it doesn't. Those kinds of assets follow inflation pretty closely unless they were overvalued to begin with. Even in that case, inflation helps you because it brings your asset price closer to the stupidly high price you paid for it*.  
  
&gt; the problem is we're are not investing not because of lack of incentive but rather because lack of credit.
  
Very true, and the lack of credit comes from very bad loans made before the crisis, inflation makes the money in those loans worth less making the debtors credit rating better and it's an incentive for savers to loan. Both of these things result in more credit.
   
Anyway the real reason I want inflation, the higher the better, is because with our austerity policies we would have very little of it, and it is the fastest way for the periphery to become competitive with the central/nordic economies that would get some inflation since they're either not in austerity or doing a lot less of it. The added benefit of doing it this way is that if your wage goes down due to inflation your home loan follows it. Where with austerity what you get is that your wage gets lowered and then you can't pay your loan and then the bank goes kaput and then the country goes kaput and then it's not funny.   
   
In summary, I want austerity in the periphery and inflation in the Eurozone as a whole, it seems the best solution.

Inflation is not a miracle cure it comes with a lot of cost. That little old lady that saved for her retirement will in all likelihood see a lot of her savings evaporate. 

Inflation also tends to bring higher interest rates as other lenders do not wish to see their money devalued. Assuming this is not done and debt is truly inflated away this is akin to a default. Good luck going to lenders afterwards.

There is some scope for increased inflation,say change &lt; 2% to be 2 &lt; x &lt; 4% but to suggest more would invite economic calamity.

&gt; The added benefit of doing it this way is that if your wage goes down due to inflation your home loan follows it.

Also, most other indicators, including wages lag inflation. If inflation is at 20% and your wages increase only by 5% then you've effectively lost of a lot of income. 

Now it does not necessarily follow that your home loan will do the same also. If you're on a fixed rate then yes you're fine, but if you're on a variable rate your mortgage costs will rise as interest rates rise.

true,keepthepace,ZZZZZZhacker,Hacker,"If you ask my personal preference, De Gaulle did the most positive things for France, in dictator-mode, during 1945-49. After that he did some good thing as president after 1958 but he was already obsolete in many societal issues.

Mitterrand is remembered for his ""barbouzeries"" : the scandals that involved secret services. He has responsibility in the Rwanda genocide and a famous quote : ""in these countries a genocide is not a big deal"". One of his prime ministers (Beregovoy) allegedly suicided (with his bodyguard's weapon), but many people suspect assassination. He somehow managed to have a good exit, and it took us incompetent presidents like Chirac and Sarkozy to see how competent he was. I think his best prime minister was Rocard, a smart man.

Chirac has been in power during 12 years. He is the symbol of what we call ""immobilisme"" (""staticness"" maybe ?). Almost nothing happened during his presidency. Reforms were not made, changes slowed down, and he has been trying to pump money here and there (only president to be condemned by a court of justice). Chirac made 3 good things IMHO : abolish military service, say no to the Iraq war, and the most important : create the levy on air tickets. The last one seems anecdotal but it actually set the framework for an international tax paid to a transnational organization (unitaid). This may be actually a very important achievement.

Sarkozy has been a corrupt and incompetent for 5 years. Sabotaging our social model, making justice and police a parody of what they represent, and promoted backward values. He is responsible for very huge deficits, even when taking the debt into account. I think he has been the worst president yet.

De Villepin was a prime minister, not president. He is remembered for promoting a law that caused riots, that was rejected by the assembly but that he still forced forward. He believes in honor (maybe because of his aristocratic education). He is hugely popular abroad because he was the spokeperson of the French 'No' at the UN but he is remembered in France as the proud minister who was to ideological to respect basic democratic principles.

Strauss-Khan has a reputation of a 'right-wing socialist'. He was the favorite in the polls before the sex scandals. I am not sure he would have won the socialists primaries though. Many believe that Sarkozy proposed him at the head of the IMF to make it difficult for him to make campaign in France, the IMF being unpopular amongst the socialist electorate.

* Allow countries to approach the crisis in a more keynesian way, but backed up by other European countries (a European fund) or the EU as a whole (Fiscal Union, or less radical, Eurobonds). When the economy is back on tracks, the austerity and the paying back of the debts can start. Keynesian policy without support of the rest of Europe will only result in markets collapsing.

I do understand that Germany can't be forced to lend money, but Germany also shouldn't be able to force countries to destroy their economy just because they have more money. That isn't fair either.

There is also another side of this story: monetary policy. Germany always has been very strict on inflation targetting because of their heritance from the Weimar Republic inflation trauma. Here Germany doesn't have the money. They just abuse their power over the ECB.

Really? You've now completely ignored the whole Keynesian economic theory. Too severe austerity is definitely a thing.

But even more than in the light of stabilisation policy is too much austerity dangerous for the people!

Austerity - or not spending money you don't have - is something which should be embraced. Do you give someone who is in debt more money to help clear the debt?

Secondly, what more spending can realisitically happen in Greece? They've already spent billions on projects which have been funded by the EU. Have you seen Athens airport? The un-used Olympic sites?

It is, but this doesn't mean that a simplistic ""more money"" approach is any smarter than the current simplistic ""less money"" strategy. Some of the cuts actually make sense, and would not be politically feasible without the pressure. Others achieve little more than making matters worse. More money would make the latter unnecessary, which would be good, but it would also prevent the former, which would be bad, and the result would be that we'd eventually end up back where we are now, only this time with even more overall debt.  
Of course, one could argue that this could be prevented by solving all the underlying problems when the immediate crisis has been averted and times are getting better, but let's stay realistic here. The Eurozone had over a decade to address its issues, Italy has taken a short break from reducing its debt load ever since, Greece had access to ridiculously cheap capital to grow its economy for almost as long, and in Spain it only lead to a construction bubble. I wouldn't want to take this bet.

Your second point points towards a good compromise, though. Merkel will fight reopening the fiscal compact toes and nails, and I think she has a point when she says that we can't reopen negotiations each time a member had elections. But this has been such an integral part of Hollande's campaign that she has to give him something that comes close, i.e., a ""growth compact"" that could be either separate or an amendment.

How would that look like? I think it would have two components, politically unpleasant structural and labor reforms as well as a budget for investments. Those funds would have to be substantial, though, to satisfy Hollande. They would also have to be either under very strict rules and tied to reforms, or get distributed via the EU, for Germany to see the ""blanc cheque problem"" addressed.

Here we go again, the [""Greek statistics""](http://www.guardian.co.uk/global/2012/apr/26/greece-europe-north-south-divide) saga.

&gt; In 2004, four years after Greece's eurozone application had been endorsed on the basis of those statistics, the newly elected New Democracy government decided to change the method of recording defence equipment expenditure, so as to lighten the budgetary burden during its term of office. This change meant recording expenditure upon payment of the deposit, instead of recording it upon delivery, as had been done by the government until then. However, this change had the effect of increasing government deficits prior to 2004 and thus damaged Greece's reputation.

&gt; ...

&gt; But the allegation indicates ignorance, not to say hypocrisy. Because even including defence expenditure upon order and not delivery, under the new recording method the revised state deficit figures in the critical year (1999) became 3.1% of GDP against 2.5% of GDP previously. The precise figure was actually 3.07%, according to Eurostat (AMECO). *This deficit is still lower than the equivalent revised deficits of other member states that were assessed on the basis of 1997 statistics, and which formed the first wave of member states that created the euro area in 1999.*

In other words, even France couldn't join the Eurozone. It should be noted that the issue was raised by European [Conservatives](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_People's_Party) (New Democracy's partners), trying to get back at European [Socialists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_of_European_Socialists) (Greece's previous government's partners).

true,Oda_Krell,EURO,"German, living in the Netherlands","(German native here, this article doesn't really address the whole range of the problem.)

I read another article (in ""Die Welt"") about this yesterday, and the court's decision is very unfortunate in my eyes, and, as much as that pains me to say it, is an expression of a low-level ""passive"" xenophobia or racism embedded in certain German laws and judicial traditions. 

First, the decision to not allowing foreigners to change their names to something more (ethnically) German sounding *could* be motivated and acceptable, since German naming law is rather restrictive in general (parents cannot just give any name to their child), and changing your name is an exceptional action in Germany. That said, however, the court's decision is actually biased and not well-motivated:

a) there is a long tradition of German authorities rejecting name changes based on the (back then even explicit) reason that non-ethnic Germans shouldn't try to ""sneak in"" and get the same level of recognition as ethnic German. The article in Die Welt points this out in more detail. Sure, this doesn't make the current day decision per se racist, but it means the current day decision stands in a racist judicial tradition at the very least.

b) Now the real problem is the justification of the court: they said it is not the job of the authorities to prevent discrimination via name change. Sounds reasonable, but it is not: preventing discrimination is *exactly* what a lot of name changes are used for, the most prominent example being if your last name is Hitler, Goebbels, etc. In that case, you can rather easily have it changed. Which is, obviously, to prevent you from suffering from negative reactions by society. So if non-ethnic Germans want to prevent negative reactions by their surroundings in a similar way, there is, I think, no good reason why they shouldn't be allowed to do so.

Afterthought: of course, the ultimate goal is to have society accept *any* name, whether it sounds ""foreign"" or not. But until we have reached that stage, I really believe it should be up to each individual immigrant whether he wants to ""assimilate"" in this way or not. I'm just adding this, because I'm sure some people think immigrants shouldn't have to change their names to feel more accepted by society. While that is of course true, the way to get there can take a while, and a good example is the (very successful) integration of many immigrant groups in the US (be it Irish, Italians or Chinese), who made in the beginning *heavy* use of assimilation by assuming ""local"" names.

tl;dr Biased decision by the court, and a sign of institutionalized racism IMO. Hope it will be repealed in the future.

This is exactly why there needs to be a debt audit. The idea that immigrants, working and middle class Greeks—exactly those hit the hardest by austerity—were raking in huge profits from debt-fuelled mega-projects just doesn't stand up to scrutiny.

I agree.

France, 2.6 times as much and the UK even more than three times per capita. I doubt the Marshall Plan money even was enough to balance out the initial policy to dismantle the remaining German industry, not to mention the bills for the occupation cost of the Western Allies.

The recent German experience with this sort of thing is the Reunification. Transfers are ongoing, and will have to for quite a bit longer. Total cost so far has been about 1.5 *trillion*, wages in the East are still only 80% of the West's, and unemployment is significantly higher.

Edit: Btw., Germany's share of the pie was equivalent to about 14 billion in today's dollars, at a population of about 68 million back then. Greece has a population of about 11 million, so the equivalent amount would be less than €2bn, or about €8bn if you go by share of GDP at the time. Let's make it €10bn.
