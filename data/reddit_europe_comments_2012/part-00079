true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; Yeah, you're right. I hope the EU banking regulator will take them under its supervision. However, in Germany the equivalent banks are quite influential and are resisting this. They think the supervisor should keep to larger cross boarder business having banks. Let's not forget their Landesbank mess. From the article:

That is very unfortunate and very short-sighted. We already have a common banking market thanks to the introduction of SEPA system. If we don't have common regulations and regulator to that market, then some member states will give advantageous circumstances to their banks that are then able to out compete and buy out their competitors.

In the next 10 years I strongly believe that we will see huge wave of mergers between European banks, leading to formation of handful of pan-European banks that dominate the market. I do hope that we get adequate regulations and regulator so that we don't have again a market meltdown in our hands.

&gt; In Finland, there's been talk of limiting the amount of borrowed funds one could use in buying real-estate. It has however met some resistance. eg. harder for young people to buy a flat. We'll see how that goes. And let's not forget Finland's housing mess from 20 years ago. 

That is true. Property in the future would only cover 80% of the loan and the rest would have to be covered by existing capital or collateral. However during the last few years, banks have already had this policy, however there has been ways to circumnavigate this.

true,I_read_a_lot,null,null,"&gt;sulla front page di atheism attualmente ci sono 25 post, di cui 25 link ad immagini, la maggior parte meme col caption. 25 su 25, il 100%, tutta la fottuta front page è costituita da immagini. ora tu dimmi a che cazzo serve. si stanno masturbando tutti a vicenda, un enorme circlejerk.

Ok, scelta della community. Se vuoi discussioni di più alto livello vai su TrueAtheism. Atheism ha quasi un milione di utenti. Non piace manco a me il livello, ma non perchè lo considero inutile (ho imparato molte cose, spesso anche da un semplice ragecomic) ma perchè lo considero a volte ridondante.

&gt;ad UN CAZZO serve ecco a cosa, dimmi cosa ha mai fatto atheism con le immagini?

e che deve fare scusa? Non è che ha una missione. Atheism è un posto anche e soprattutto per venting di una situazione pesante, molto più pesante di quella che trovi in Italia (che già è pesante di per se, ma almeno abbiamo il ""vantaggio"" che avendo la chiesa cattolica l'esclusiva, non c'è questo atteggiamento da tagliagole alla ricerca di adepti come in USA). Da noi, essere ateo non ti porta ad avere amici e parenti che ti dicono che andrai all'inferno o che ti cacciano di casa. Là sì.

&gt; il massimo che possa aver fatto è che un paio di religiosi sono passati di lì visto che è un subreddit automaticamente sulla frontpage, e si sono convertiti

Again, non è lo scopo del gruppo. Il punto non è di fare adepti. Il punto è di criticare le ridicolaggini e immoralità perpetrate da religiosi, religioni e loro adepti.

&gt; e dopo aver smesso di essere religiosi hanno iniziato anche loro a masturbarsi. ci sarà meno dell'1% che sta facendo effettivamente qualcosa.

Questo è un [fenomeno puramente umano, applicabile a situazioni simili](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_%28Internet_culture%29).

&gt;la maggior parte delle persone su /r/atheism pensa di essere più intelligente di qualsiasi altro religioso

Bah, sebbene per esperienza sappia bene che religiosità e intelligenza non sono necessariamente correlate *in una data persona* (dato che vivono in due ""aree"", se mi concedi l'astrazione, distinte del cervello che riesce sempre a risolvere la dissonanza cognitiva) non puoi certo affermare che il non vedere l'incongruenza logica sia, per quell'argomento, sorgente di dubbio. è come se uno vedesse una illusione ottica e, invece di esaminarla dal punto di vista possibilistico, semplicemente la accettasse come vera, senza capire che i propri sensi (o le proprie emozioni) sono afflitte da questo tipo di incongruenze.

Un sintomo di intelligenza è (tra i tanti) anche rendersi conto di quanto il nostro corpo e la nostra mente sbaglino o siano plasmabili o influenzabili da fattori esterni, culturali, e di tradizione.

&gt; e cosa fanno per provare a convertire le persone?

Dubito che la gente in atheism sia in una missione di conversione (o deconversione, per essere più appropriati dal punto di vista logico). a gente di atheism è in una missione per parlare di atteggiamenti ipocriti, attraverso vari strumenti sui quali puoi non essere d'accordo, con altri atei. Il fatto che il gruppo sia frontpage è dettato dal fatto che i gruppi frontpage sono gruppi che rappresentano la comunità di reddit, essendo i più popolari. A me rompono le palle le solite immagini o cazzate varie di gaming, dato che non videogioco, ma non sono lì a rompere le palle. Loggo e lo tolgo.

&gt; le insultano

Non ho alcun problema ad insultare qualcuno che si crede sacro e prezioso e che non avrebbe alcuna remora a mettere in piedi l'inquisizione se fosse tirato verso il basso a sufficienza. La nostra civiltà ci ha affrancato da tali crimini, ma crimini restano. La _giustificazione_ di tali crimini a mezzo religioso è ciò che trasforma azioni crudeli in azioni giuste. 

Ora, puoi certo affermare che questo è dipendente dalla propria filosofia di vita. Il fatto è che da un lato, io, in quanto persona, accetto che la mia filosofia di vita possa necessitare di revisione. Quando ero più giovane, ero contro al matrimonio per i gay. Oggi lo supporto pienamente. La mia moralità è cresciuta (uscendo da una moralità cattolica) perchè ho avuto spazio mentale per farla crescere. Se sei religioso (nel senso _vero_ del termine), non hai questo spazio di manovra perchè giustifichi una filosofia morale basandoti non su un'analisi effettiva della condizione sotto analisi, ma su un'analisi modificata da una dottrina immutabile che non lascia spazio al pensiero personale (o meglio, lo lascia ma solo all'interno delle mura che sono state costruite). Questo è lavaggio del cervello. Siamo tutti vittime di propaganda. Il problema di chi è vittima di propaganda è che non sa di esserlo, e quando gli vengono presentate prove che la propaganda è tale, non la vedono o rifiutano le prove. Siamo stati sotto propaganda degli stati uniti per 40 anni, ma non ce ne siamo mai accorti. Ora lo vediamo che era propaganda. Lo stesso viaggio sulla luna è stata propaganda. Pensiamo che gli americani abbiano vinto la seconda guerra mondiale, ma la russia ha giocato un ruolo determinante che non ci è mai stato raccontato. E via così. Il punto è di capire che siamo vittime di propaganda da varie fonti, e dobbiamo sempre tenere in considerazione ciò. 

Puntualizzo: non sono comunista. Sono socialista, ma non sono ferreo, proprio perchè so che non c'è silver bullet intellettuale, economico, filosofico. I problemi hanno forma sempre molto più complicata delle scatole in cui vogliamo metterli, ma l'uomo semplice ragiona solo in termini di scatole quadrate o al massimo rettangolari, ovviamente di acciaio inox 18/10 spesso un dito.

&gt; o usano uno delle solite citazioni del cazzo della bibbia facendogli notare come non la stanno seguendo alla lettera, e MAGIA MAGIA, non funziona così.

No, non funziona così, ma l'alternativa qual è? Sorbirsi il sermone da uno che non sa un cazzo della bibbia e te la vuole infilare in testa, a scuola, nel circolo sociale, nella cultura generale, nelle scelte economiche e sociali ? Qualcosa uno deve pur fare per far sentire la propria voce.


&gt;edit: ed è esattamente quello che hai fatto con me, insultarmi

eh vabbè, te la porti a casa. Si cresce anche così. 

&gt; se stavi provando a ""convertirmi"" hai sbagliato di grosso

Convertirti? Magari posso dire che ciò che dici è stupido o non circostanziato. Sei padrone di tenere la tua idea balzana, basta che non pretendi di farci funzionare una nazione ignorando i fatti, e che non ti lamenti se poi sei senza soldi. 

&gt; se insulti tutti i religiosi che trovi e pensi siano una razza inferiore, ti sbagli di nuovo.

Again, se il problema è filosofico, uno può trovare un punto di discussione sensato, se c'è una base di connessione argomentativa. Uno può dirmi mi danno fastidio i gay perchè mi dà fastidio vedere due uomini che si baciano. Fair enough. Inappropriato ma fair enough. A me danno fastidio le unghie sulla lavagna. Se uno mi dice che ""offende dio"", è una delusional testa di cazzo. Non inferiore, non razza. Semplicemente una testa di cazzo, come tante altre. Il problema, purtroppo, è che son troppi, come domani potrebbero essere troppi in italia a pensare che se non sei musulmano non devi avere gli stessi diritti, ma sono anche troppi quelli che non capiscono l'importanza della raccolta differenziata, della riduzione delle emissioni di CO2, della preparazione per le calamità naturali e via così. Almeno però, se tale ignoranza ha una speranza di essere migliorata, va bene. Quando l'ignoranza è radicata a tal punto che niente, nemmeno la logica e il rispetto per i diritti umani, ti permette di lasciare spazio a un cambiamento di punto di vista (perchè è tutto dettato da una entità invisibile e onnipotente) allora c'è un problema. 

Un problema che è ancora più evidente oggi. Se trovassero inconfutabilmente il papa che si tromba un ragazzino (cosa che non ha fatto, ma ha certamente protetto chi l'ha fatto), sarebbe comunque difeso ad oltranza. Non improbabile, la chiesa ha fatto cose atroci in passato: omicidi, rapimenti, incarcerazioni, censure e ne è sempre uscita pulita e con una mandria di pecore a difenderla, generazione dopo generazione. Non vuoi che ti cerchi dei link a riguardo, qualsiasi libro di storia valida questo punto di vista, ma se proprio insisti posso favorire. Oggi, siamo bombardati da pretaglia che spara sentenze su qualsiasi argomento senza sapere un tubo e senza autorità, una vox populi di ovvietà, populismo o inazione mascherata da azione, a perenne ricordare al popolo italiano che è il vaticano che comanda e che dice come pensare e come agire, attaccando o sopprimendo il dissenso, attivamente o attraverso il modo di fare generale. Prova a fare un commento negativo sul vaticano o sul papa su quotidiano.net e a farlo passare alla censura se sei capace. Trovami un contraddittorio (che non sia crozza o quell'altro di cui non ricordo il nome) di uguale presenza mediatica e peso politico e monetario al vaticano. Persino la lega si è genuflessa, e per dar contro agli immigrati musulmani ha sposato la ""tradizione"" italiana di una religione, similmente quella musulmana, importata dal medio oriente attraverso flussi migratori. Il fatto che sia successo 1700 anni fa non la rende diversa, perchè detta come va detta, 1700 anni non sono poi così tanti. Sono l'altro ieri.

I absolutely agree but if you choose to deal drugs in the UAE, Singapore, Indonesia or any such country that imposes very severe penalties for such acts, you have only yourself to blame. Their policies on drugs are not exactly unknown.

That's the thing, isn't it? The part where Brussels can veto a national budget when the deficit passes a threshold is already too much for many, from among the public as well as national governments. We have to find a compromise somehow. This is already a big step forward from the current ""hey everybody, let's try to act responsibly, mkay?""

But there's the potential for much more in there, they're just trying not to scare anybody off before negotiations have even started. ""Pooling of decision making"", for example.

A banking union is absolutely essential to break feedback loops when one member gets into trouble. Banks are always at risk if an economy takes a hit like a housing bubble. If there then isn't enough faith in the government's ability to bail them out if necessary and guarantee deposits, customers move their savings to another country, which makes their situation worse, which means they can't lend, which gets businesses into trouble, which means people lose their jobs and the government's interest rates increase because cost for unemployment benefits goes up while tax revenue goes down, which weakens its ability to back the banks, which makes their situation worse, and the government's situation is worsened by the higher interest rates, which again causes people to lose faith in the banks.  
I don't see how preventing a crisis from feeding itself should be moral hazard. To the contrary, there would be less risk of contagion, so less need to bail out countries that get into trouble. Take Greece, for example. Compared to the GDP of the Eurozone as a whole, their debt isn't all that much. It's that *some* member states would have problems covering that for their own banks what makes it so dangerous.

It does address competitiveness issues and imbalances. It's just not specific. For example:

*""Measures to strengthen the political and administrative capacity of national institutions and foster national ownership of reforms could be taken where necessary, as this is a vital condition for the efficient implementation of growth enhancing reforms.""*

What exactly are ""measures to strengthen the political and administrative capacity""? No one knows. This is just a very, very general outline, with many ""coulds"", left to the actual negotiations. The section is titled ""Towards an integrated economic policy framework"" which *could* go quite far. Or not. It's to soon to be disappointed. Or to get scared, depending on where you stand.

&gt; No inflation to help out the troubled economies.

true,executivemonkey,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt;Some of the wealthiest parts of Germany are almost completely Catholic

Some nation's cultures have derived their values primarily from Protestantism, others from Catholicism, so that a person who is, say, Catholic but also German will likely have many historically-Protestant values (e.g., austere, hard-working) which he gets from his German national identity, because nationality is often more important than religion when determining a contemporary European's values.  

In other words, so long as Germans in general have historically-Protestant values - and they seem to - then whether an individual German is Catholic, Protestant, atheist, etc., is not as important as whether that person identifies as ""German,"" a national identity with a strong Protestant influence on it, even though the superstitious and church-going aspects of that influence have largely withered away.

So it's not that being, say, a Catholic in contemporary society will make you conform to the Catholic values of several centuries ago, it is rather that a national culture which evolved from the Catholic views of several centuries ago will likely have retained some of those values, even if today they are explained in a secular manner, and the same for Protestant-derived cultures.

The cost advantage German firms (Finnish as well?) enjoy over the periphery, its costs inflated by the capital inflows from the core until the financial crisis made them reverse, is a thing that should be discussed more I think. Wages being sticky it's not that easy to perform an internal devaluation, especially when demand is soft. Finnish exports haven't been doing that well either. Germany's mittelstand too strong for them also?

The eurobonds would help remedy this problem, it'd allow the affected economies to adjust through a period of slow demand and conditions that otherwise look like debt deflation. Another way is to use inflation to even out the cost differential and keep economic activity going. A third way countries like german and finland can pay for it would be through a euro zone break up. the FT had a nice thing on this, either transfers, inflation or break up. Germany and co will pay one way or the other.

Let's remember that capital flight from the periphery into the core is another unfair advantage german etc. firms are enjoying over their competitors in the periphery in the form of lower interest rates and easier loan criteria.

- First ancient macedonians ceased to exist 2000 years ago when they mixed with the greeks (admitting they were different people, good start). Got it.
- They formed the Byzantine empire under one language, religion, and culture? (even 11th graders know they byzantine emprire was a byproduct of the eastern half of the roman empire, whose official language was roman in the first few centuries, it later became greek. Additionally it had many emperors of different origin who weren't greek. Fuck those other peoples in the empire...) Got it.
- People there were both bulgarians and greeks but were calling themselves macedonians as a second title. Like you call yourself a turk as a second title? Got it.
- So then somehow the slavic population (me?) knew they were bulgarian, but in 1945 Tito showed up and started brainwashing them and applying physiological pressure to convince them they were not greeks, not bulgarians, but they were the decedents of the ancient macedonians. Got it, the brainwashing started with my grandfather and father who were pressured by a Croat to believe they were Macedonians. Got it.
- Greeks hating Macedonians, that's what they're teaching us in school? No, that's just the treatment we get when we visit your country (which makes no sense to me but i don't live there and being landlocked like that must suck). He united greece against the common enemy the persians? Freshen up on your history, greece was never united under his rule, it was conquered, it did unite though right after his fall. But sure, got it.
- Genes doesn't make a nation, culture and language does? Just ask the native indians in the US. But sure, forget blood and history, what you speak is what matters the most. Do you know that big part of ancient greek culture was being fucked in the ass? I'm not judging if you're gay, but if you aren't I'd like to know if you still participate in those kind of parties. Because judging by you, that's one of the things that make you Greek. I have a strong feeling that you do, but sure, I got it.
- Enough about the byzantine empire, if it was so greek, you'd think they'd call it the Greek empire and kept all the land where Greeks used to live? Most of the educated world at that time spoke greek and was christian, I guess that means all people were greek at that period. Got it.

This has to be the one of the most retarded things I've ever read in my life (top 5 for sure), and I want my 15 minutes back. The worst part is that I'm not even a great patriot or anything, don't live there, I was not educated there, nor do I agree with everything Macedonia does as a country. Now, since this is obviously never going to be resolved (unless the whole brainwashed population of Macedonia and parts of Greece and Bulgaria commits suicide or something), how about you start being more polite to visitors, start paying taxes, mind your own fucking business and look at your own shitty country, and just let those people be? Also, please pick up a western history book every now and then. It's nice to read a more objective history - even for its entertainment value (from your perspective at least).

OF COURSE they do. Why do you think interest rates climbed so fast in Greece in 2008/2009? It wasn't because Greece's debt-to-GDP ratio suddenly exceeded some ""magic"" percentage (if that were true, Japan would be in big trouble); it wasn't because investors suddenly realized that the Greek state was a fucking mess (even though it really, really is); it was because investors lost confidence that Greece would repay its debts - which really means that investors lost confidence that the EU would make sure that Greece pays back its debts. Therefore, we can view the rise in Greece's interest rates as a vote of no-confidence to the monetary union's healthy functioning. If a speculative attack on any member-state is a speculative attack on the entire union, then it makes no sense to have member-states attempt to fight back on their own. 

I'm not saying that eurobonds will solve the Euro crisis; but they are a necessary step to doing so.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; It's only fair that countries that have profited from the monetary policy of the last 10 years also help with the more unfortunate outfalls of that same policy. The cost advantage German firms (Finnish as well?) enjoy over the periphery, its costs inflated by the capital inflows from the core until the financial crisis made them reverse, is a thing that should be discussed more I think. Wages being sticky it's not that easy to perform an internal devaluation, especially when demand is soft. Finnish exports haven't been doing that well either. Germany's mittelstand too strong for them also?

The only cost advantages that the Euro has given has been lowering of transaction and potential costs, and this has been shared by all member states. People do claim that Germany has kept wages down, but they forget that lower wages just mean higher profits. People also forget that we live in global world, if German wages would be higher, German firms would either increase automation or move their functions to countries with lower costs. In this light I can't really understand any talk about having cost advantages.

In case of Finland, our problem is that we are facing increased global competition especially from producers coming from developing countries, especially from China. The only remedies for that is to reinvent what we do and in the mean time increase our internal efficiency: in short downsize, reorganize and refocus. 

&gt; The eurobonds would help remedy this problem, it'd allow the affected economies to adjust through a period of slow demand and conditions that otherwise look like debt deflation. Another way is to use inflation to even out the cost differential and keep economic activity going. A third way countries like german and finland can pay for it would be through a euro zone break up. the FT had a nice thing on this, either transfers, inflation or break up. Germany and co will pay one way or the other.

And what would these adjustments be? The problem in many of the troubled countries is that public sector is too large and inefficient. The only way is to cut and enable the private sector to expand their role in the economy.

&gt; Let's remember that capital flight from the periphery into the core is another unfair advantage german etc. firms are enjoying over their competitors in the periphery in the form of lower interest rates and easier loan criteria.

Interest rates to companies are the same no matter in what member state they are. Also thanks to SEPA system, the whole Euroarea is now one big common banking area meaning that any Greek business can open up an account in for example German bank and use it to handle all their transactions.

&gt; It's silly to make it into some moral story whereby some nations can with happenstance now grandstand and act holier than thou. It makes me sick.

It is not a moral story, but something work and other don't. The Soviet central planned communism didn't work, that is a fact, so it is also a fact that southern European economies with rigid government structures don't work out in the global competition, that is a fact too. Either you face the fact and fix it or you don't.

&gt; Weird way to handle a member state bankruptcy. So the banks would be made whole on the outstanding bonds they hold? Or would every holder of debt from member state X get bailed out? Why not just have the ECB act as a lender of last resort like in the UK, like in the US? That's what would work for every one. A federal europe with a democratic constitution. This would work for Germany and we could have our financial system and prosperity for the peoples of Europe. But no, national leaders don't want to give up sovereignty to the most effective level. -.-

The banks would either get capital loans convertible to equity in a given time or direct capital injections in return of equity. This would allow the normal functioning of banks and allow them to finance private businesses. This way we would lower overall risks facing the economy, but in the same time keep member states and banks in line as they still would face consequences for their actions.

And lastly, I think that it is a bad idea in general to have a central bank act as lender of last resort for the government. The central bank should have the ability to bailout the financial sector, but only with strict conditions, but definitely not the ability to bailout the state. This is because once you set an example of the central bank bailing out the politicians, it will only lead politicians to act more irresponsible.",0,1340745825,null,0,false,0,c55z1ks,t3_vn2v1,t1_c55z1ks,t1_c55yc86,null,1429236734,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;The only cost advantages that the Euro has given has been lowering of transaction and potential costs, and this has been shared by all member states. People do claim that Germany has kept wages down, but they forget that lower wages just mean higher profits.

Or you undercut your competitors in the periphery who have had to increase wages due to the cost inflation brought about by capital inflow from Germany and the Netherlands.

&gt;And what would these adjustments be? The problem in many of the troubled countries is that public sector is too large and inefficient. The only way is to cut and enable the private sector to expand their role in the economy.

Spain and Ireland were a banking crisis initially. There public finance were fine. It then morphed into a fiscal crisis when they had to try make up for the capital flight.

&gt;Interest rates to companies are the same no matter in what member state they are. Also thanks to SEPA system, the whole Euroarea is now one big common banking area meaning that any Greek business can open up an account in for example German bank and use it to handle all their transactions.

Sure, they can open an account. I'm sure a corporate finance banker who has never seen the business before will be able to make a good credit evaluation. Of course they won't due to information asymmetries. They won't touch it or charge exorbitant rates to cover the costs of adverse selection.

&gt;It is not a moral story, but something work and other don't. The Soviet central planned communism didn't work, that is a fact, so it is also a fact that southern European economies with rigid government structures don't work out in the global competition, that is a fact too. Either you face the fact and fix it or you don't.

Reductio ad absurdum. Yeah, it had nothing to do with all that money that flowed in, inflating the economy and then leaving it suddenly. All this without the proper EU institutions to handle these trade and capital imbalances. 

&gt;The banks would either get capital loans convertible to equity in a given time or direct capital injections in return of equity. This would allow the normal functioning of banks and allow them to finance private businesses. This way we would lower overall risks facing the economy, but in the same time keep member states and banks in line as they still would face consequences for their actions.

Yeah, and what would happen to all other holders of government bonds? Pension funds, private investors etc.? You think these would be viable securities for trading?

&gt;And lastly, I think that it is a bad idea in general to have a central bank act as lender of last resort for the government. The central bank should have the ability to bailout the financial sector, but only with strict conditions, but definitely not the ability to bailout the state. This is because once you set an example of the central bank bailing out the politicians, it will only lead politicians to act more irresponsible.

Don't run with the bulls. 

I started when I was eight with little cows, moved up to chotas and and then to smallish bulls. The bulls being used at Pamplona are full-sized premium grade, meaning not only are they in the 500kg range, but they're bread for their desire to engage and they'll happily slice you up pretty good if they get ahold of you. My most vivid memory, aside from getting caught myself, was seeing a guy pinned against the barricade with nowhere to go and passing out as the bull ripped of his pants with two head swipes. Not sure what was more embarrassing to him, being butt naked in front of hundreds of strangers or getting caught.

The (Spanish) people running aren't doing it just for the thrill and that's something that takes a long time to understand. Globalization has turned it into a doing thing, but that doesn't make it any safer nor imply that it's open to all. Those running will have years of experience and a sense of timing that a person who's not sure what to wear to the event (you) could ever garner at a moment's notice. There too many variables to even begin to explain.

If you do decide to go running with them, keep an eye on the people watching, who are more likely than not looking to see something exciting - obviously - like a gringo being gored, than they are to watch the bulls run straight past them. They won't get out of your way if you need safety and they won't help you if you're in trouble, not just because of tradition (won't even get into that) but simply because there's an angry, unpredictable 500kg beast running amok, they're just an innocent spectator oblivious to your predicament and they actually get a thrill being caught up in the finite nature of the event. Something they've been waiting for all year. It's the superbowl being played out in their neighborhood streets with the chance of someone being killed.

Qui, in teoria, hai tanta di quella ragione che la metà è troppa. Purtroppo la pratica soccorre nell'impacchettare la ragione e buttarla nel buco del cesso con una deliziosa musichetta di sottofondo. Perché è dai tempi di Neanderthal che chi ha soldi e potere ha anche un grosso agio nello sfruttare le regole per la propria convenienza sulla pelle del povero rubagalline (che, al solito, è quello che finisce col prendersela laggiù).

I have no illusions that anything on this front will actually get done in the next few years, or that if something is done, that it will be even half as (what I consider to be) reasonable as my ideas. 

So this is more of a thought experiment. I wanted to create a framework that was 

* more democratic than the current European Union; 
* more dynamic and capable of dealing with countries' differing opinions regarding the pace of integration; 
* less beholden to state governments; 
* less beholden to extraneous organizations (political and commercial); 
* open to, but several steps away from full European integration (i.e. a European country with full foreign policy powers); 
* attractive to somewhat euroskeptic peoples/governments (e.g. the UK) by offering a minimal integration option. 

It's heavily inspired by the U.S. Constitution, but takes some cues from the Articles of Confederation, the Treaty of Lisbon, and some state constitutions. The second chamber of Parliament is essentially the Council of Ministers, but I thought it important to integrate it into the legislature; the states can appoint them however they like, so some states could decide to have them elected by their people, make them more independent and the chamber more like the U.S. Senate. 

The first three sections (plus a preamble) are designed to be general and short, like the U.S. Constitution; they have no business being longer than absolutely necessary. The fourth section is, by design, very modular. Any agreement governing the euro would be one such ""voluntary treaty"", as would anything regarding a new economic government of sorts, a banking union, eurobonds, what have you. If this framework existed today, all these decisions could be made without fearing the veto of non-participating governments or court problems stemming from using EU resources for stuff that technically isn't part of the the EU. 

Accession and withdrawal require unanimity, since the second section would have to be changed. Presumably the other member states would assent if any country held a referendum to leave, though (and if they didn't, the Supreme Court might force them to, since presumably the right of a people to determine their own fate would be enlisted in section 1). 

Fun idea: the state governments have to negotiate amongst themselves who gives what to the EU budget. If they can't reach agreement, the EU is allowed to levy taxes. Nobody wants that.

Not exactly what I said. I said, the German constitution doesn't allow for Eurobonds in its current form (or any form I've heard of) because of the potential loss of sovereign budget control. I don't know how constitutional changes work in your country, but in Germany they're extremely rare, and any party attempting to change the constitution face *major* obstacles. In addition, as rtft noted above, certain parts of the constitution are in fact *protected* from being changed (most notably the initial paragraphs that define basic unalienable human rights). Note that I'm not completely sure if rtft is correct that the budgetary control by the parliament is actually protected by the ""eternity clause"" of the constitution.

When you can move out depends on the lease contract.
To move out you have to give a written ""Kündigung"" = ""notice of termination"" to the landlord.
After German law it's easier for the tenant to terminate the contract than it is for the landlord. In general there is a ordinary notice of termination and an extraordinary termination without notice.

Usually it is a three months period of notice for the ordinary termination. You don't have to give a reason, but you would have to pay 3 more months before you can move out.

Termination of the contract without notice works immediately, but is only possible if there are serious problems, such as contract-infringement by the landlord or health risks etc.

Of course landlord and tenant can agree at any time to suspend the contract immediately.
There also different variants of contracts. My landlord for example tolerates termination with a 1 month notice at the end of each university semester.

The arrangements are always a bit different, but generally one rents a room in a flat, with facilities shared among the participants in the WG (kitchen, bathroom, living room). Rent is generally paid in equal parts, sometimes with different slightly different shares if one or the other room are smaller of bigger (but that depends on the agreement among the participants). Cleaning duties are shared by all the people living there (uhm... hopefully...). In most cases one of the people living there is the Hauptmieter and just sublets to the other people, sometimes the landlord rents out a flat to students separately.

In most cases trying to get into a WG involves having a short interview with the guys currently living there, mostly to make sure that the people in question actually fit in there with the rest of the people, and to make sure they aren't sociopaths.

Depending on what your friend wants a WG might be a great experience or a bother. The last two WGs I lived in (all with at least 5 people living there) had great atmosphere and great comradeship which I miss a lot now that I live only with my girlfriend. There always was someone around to talk to, do something with, cook with, or just to hang out with. On the other hand it can go the other way and the whole thing can go sour if people are having to do too much with each other. This can be a problem especially if different cultures start to clash (memories of my American housemate with his collection of mold cultures start to emerge... no, don't think about it!) or if something comes up the person did not let on during the interview (oh by the way, I like to play my violin at least 2 hours a day/I am a registered sex offender/I like to have loud S&amp;M with my boyfriend/etc.*). Also sometimes people can just be toxic to each other. 

Moving out of the apartment after a short time is generally not liked, but sometimes it just doesn't work out. People are expected to stay at least a semester, but if it doesn't work out it might be for the best. But well, in that case it's just my opinion. I noticed that there is generally some moving around even after the semester starts.

Non odio perchè non mi fai ne' caldo ne' freddo (anche se, ad essere sincero, è un piacere e un onore poter discutere con te) ne' odio la gente di cui ho parlato nel post sopra. Posso ritenere immorale, irrazionale, stupido. L'odio è un sentimento troppo forte, riservato a chi compie crimini efferati che mobilitano un'azione diretta e che definisce lo scopo della propria vita. L'odio è un sentimento motivante la vendetta attiva diretta alla persona. Puoi dire che odio le idee, i concetti. Le persone sono solo agendo in modo irrazionale, illegale. Odio chi uccide la moglie? Odio chi infibula la propria figlia? forse. forse no. Non so dirtelo. L'odio è un sentimento spontaneo che deriva dal profondo. Non credo di odiare, non le persone per quello che pensano, ma eventualmente le azioni che compiono in nome di quel che pensano. 

Non insulto perchè la interpretazione di insulto o no dipende da te, non da me. Io faccio presente solo dei fatti, filosofici forse, basati sulla logica forse, ma fatti. L'insulto dipende sempre dalla percezione di chi riceve e dal contesto. Ora, se uno è sovrappeso e io gli dicessi che è sovrappeso, presento un fatto, ma sarei offensivo. Certo, sarei offensivo forse ma, a seconda del contesto potrei anche essergli d'aiuto, facendogli presente che ha bisogno di aiuto medico, per esempio. La presentazione di un fatto è offensivo rispetto al contesto. Il problema deriva nel momento in cui uno che pesi 160 kg pretenda di salire su una giostra tarata fino a un massimo di 120 kg, gli si venga negato in virtù del fatto che è sovrappeso e ne tragga offesa o, peggio, pretenda di chiudere la giostra perchè non è accessibile per il suo peso. Similmente, chi promuove politiche, decisioni scolastiche o diritti umani mentre è viziato da un sentimento religioso sta commettendo lo stesso problema.

Seems like the program is the best bet.

As for paperwork, it doesn't seem too bad. I have to register as an 'au pair,' so *that's* what it's called. Hopefully that's a relatively simple process. However, this summer I might become a citizen of a EU country so that might make it a bit easier.

You don't know a lot about German history do you?

Cliff notes version: there was no German national identity before the 20th century. Germany wasn't unified until the 1870s. It has always consisted of several smaller states, each with its own distinct cultural characteristics. Difference is these days they are all in a federation rather than being functionally independent entities.

But hey, if you still insist on your argument I will point you to Austria. Long considered to be a natural and definite part of Germany but today thought of as a people and nation of its own, this country is and has long been completely Catholic. It has, excepting WW2, not been part of any sort of unified German nation state. It definitely has its own national identity separate from that of modern Germany, and its catholic heritage is definitely a part of that identity.

true,[deleted],null,null,"It really depends on the WG. They aren't just for college students, plenty of working people live in them too. 

I'd divide WGs into a couple categories:

A reine Zweck-WG, which basically means you just live together, that's it. The goal isn't meant to be a place to make friends and hang out together or anything, you just share an apartment and split the rent together. I'd say this is the most basic type of WG. 

There are also berufstätige WGs, which are aimed to those who are working and usually a bit older, in the 25-35 age range. 

Studenten-WGs are probably the most common, particularly in cities with universities. It's pretty self-explanatory, a group of students living together. 

Zwischenmiete is a short-term sublet.

The process varies depending on the WG, but generally they'll invite you for a short interview to see the apartment and get to know you. When my WG was looking for a new roommate a few months ago we ""interviewed"" 12 people before deciding on one. Sometimes there will be an ""open house"" where people interested in the apartment can drop by and see the place. These can be a bit awkward and feel like group interviews at times. 

If you get a Zwischenmiete apartment you can absolutely move out after a few months. If you sign a sub-let and then decide to move out a few months later you can usually do so, provided you can find someone to take your place. 

I personally like living in a WG. I'm 25 and working, but it affords me to live in a nice neighborhood in a big apartment that I otherwise couldn't afford on my own. I also don't mind the company. I like my roommates for the most part. They really vary though. I've had some friends with total horror stories and others who found really good friends through theirs. The key is to just look at a lot of places and not just pick the first one that comes along.

Please consider these two things for your original question:

No. The copyright owners just want to get paid. No one keeps you from using their materials as long as they get a cut. That's how copyright works all over the world.

We had the same crisis, same problems and the same ""austerity"" that so many people love to bash. True, wages in the public sector were cut a little, but the fall in the private sector was much worse. While many private companies closed and fired all of their employes, few public sector jobs were closed. Public sector did not shrink, it only stopped growing for a while (now it's skyrocketing away from control like it did before). Taxes were increased (they already are on par with those that are in Denmark), regulations stiffened. So fewer businesses had to work in less favorable conditions to keep the parasites of bureaucracy alive and happy. The public sector was financed by debt in the hopes that the money would trickle down and  increase consumption. The small growth that we are having is due to the businesses that have held on despite all that, and to investors that despite all the risk still try to create useful services in a climate of idiotic regulation, and to the people that by one way or the other found means to pay their mortgages (true a lot of them just went to work abroad and sent the money home in stead of defaulting). 

The last thing i wish to point out is that the Baltics were not a Libertarian free market utopia after the fall of ussr. Most of the laws were straight away passed down from the former comunist codes. The only difference is that services are private, not centraly planed (and that still has a lot of exceptions), but the laws and the mentality of the rulers are the same.

Lithuanian government cut public spending by 30 percent- including public sector wages 20 to 30 percent and reducing pensions by 11 percent.


Bureaucrats’ salaries were cut by 8-36%, with overall spending on bureaucrats’ salaries decreasing by 19.1% in 2010 compared to 2008.


Even Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius took a pay cut of 45 percent


The net effect of the tight fiscal policies on the country’s finances was a savings equal to 9 percent of gross domestic product, the second largest fiscal adjustment in a developed economy, after Latvia’s, since the credit crisis began.

edit:

 25.04.2012 - Nerijus Maciulis, chief economist at the Swedbank:


""Lithuania's economy is reaping its fruits at the moment. The roots in 2009-2010 were bitter, when adjustments had to be made, numbers of employees and expenditures in public sector had to be reduced, however, a present situation shows that majority of euro area states have to take similar or even more drastic measures, while, Lithuania is already able to move forward,"" the expert said in the presentation of his economic report. 
 

According to Maciulis, Lithuanian economy could be aptly called the fastest developing in the EU. Only Poland or Estonia could outstripped its growth.

 

""Tendencies at the beginning of the year prove that Lithuania's economy will grow 3.3% this year. Even though, the growth is slower than the last year – as then it was almost 6%, but it still remains one of the fastest in Europe,"" the economist said.

 

He forecasts that this year and in 2013 domestic demand will remain the main source for economic growth.

 

""It has been forecasted that unemployment rate will decrease by 13% this year and by 11% in 2013. Returning to the natural rate of unemployment which stands at around 6%, still is to be achieved in long time perspective, while, faster decrease in this rate could be stimulated by recovery in construction sector which has cut 91 thousand jobs due to the crisis,"" the Swedbank analyst said.

 

Commenting on changes in average wage in Lithuania, Maciulis forecasted it to increase by 4.3%; however, he noted that it will greatly depend on minimum monthly wage which, most probably, will increase in the mid-year. However, one should not expect general increase in wages nor this year, neither in 2013, he said.

 
""In 2013, external factors influence to prices in Lithuania was less significant; therefore, we reduced inflation forecast for 2013 to 2.5%. The government budget deficit in 2013 will keep going down and will make 2% of GDP, so we forecast that the most likely date for adopting euro in Lithuania is 2015,"" Maciulis said.

[Sayyid Qutb](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayyid_Qutb), un philosophe égyptien, a énoncé, pour la première fois, l'idée que ces nouveaux riches arabes sont trop influencé par la vie de la bourgeoisie occidentale, et qu'il faut rejeter cette mode de vie et revenir vers une vie plus austère et religieuse. De là est parti le mouvement des Frères musulmans en Égypte, et d'autre mouvements pareils partout dans la région. La nouvelle bourgeoisie arabe a essayé de supprimer ce mouvement par des mesure inhumaines. Tout ça a engendré des mouvements musulmans beaucoup plus radicales et intégristes. De cette répression est né Al-Qaïda pendant les années 80.

Tout ça pour dire que c'est ce genre de comportement merdique par Hessa et sa famille qui est une des racines de tous les problèmes dans la région. Et j'ai hâte du jour où les vrais citoyens du moyen-orient ouvriront ses yeux et se révolteront pour réclamer les droits qui leurs sont refusés.

German money was some of the stupidest money in the market, famously, and German banks overinvested in the peripheral property bubbles.  If the peripheral countries were to default (and that is looking more likely as austerity bites, and Merkel closes off possibilities like eurobonds), the German banks would have huge holes in their balance sheets, and would probably fail.

In addition, the rapidly appreciating interest rate of the NeuDeutschmark, and the failure of markets for German goods in the defaulter countries would be disastrous for the German economy, which is unbalanced towards exports.

So, a left and a right: German savings disappearing due to the stupidity of their banks' investment departments, and the disappearance of a huge chunk of Germany's export markets.

Leaving the question of European solidarity aside for a moment, I agree, it's even in Germany's self interest to keep the EZ together.

Problem is, what is an effective response to the crisis, which on the other hand does not open the floodgates for unproductive economic behavior?

Our income tax is 21% and usually this number is brought up when talking about taxes in Lithuania. However social security, healthcare and other taxes are payed by the employer, so you just don't see them, but the wage is lower nonetheless. All taxes amount to somewhere between 35,4% and 42% plus additional 21 % VAT. Since the taxation system is more or less flat (it's complicated, so I think there is no point in explaining it in detail) most people pay closer to 42% than  to 35%. For example a person who makes minimum wage after all taxes gets 650 LT. In his wage check he sees that before taxes his wage is 800 LT. However an employer who hires him has to pay additional 250 LT in taxes. So his real wage is 1050 LT, from which he pays 38,1 % to the state. So it is closer to Denmark's rate than most people think. I meant that the 21% that is usually presented as the tax rate is quite false. However we do not have such significant taxes on real estate, corporate taxes and so on which are higher in Denmark.

Fact is: If you do not have the usage rights, you cannot use it. Period. There are specific exceptions with *huge* attachements of what you can or cannot use to teach - and this is not meant 'any teacher' but specific kinds of teaching like in public school because they have done licencing deals.

Most normal commercial schools like language schools are NOT covered by this and are required to make their own negotiations. Those kind of people like to quote pages like you have linked above saying ""but we teach too!"" without reading the fine print.

1) Get rid of individual representatives in the second chamber and replace them by member states governments represented by a minister. This in short is return of council of ministers and I have a very good reason to call for its return, and that is... 

* Governments have state bureaucracies helping them to make informed decisions, for example even small countries like Finland have dedicated software that forecast what kind of ramifications certain actions or laws can have to the country.
* Governments act based on consensus, consensus between coalition partners, consensus inside the parliamentary group, consensus inside the party, etc.. What this ensures is that people with big egos have less opportunity to act selfishly and are restricted by the bigger group to behave in a constructive manner.

2) No voluntary treaties. Either you are in the European Union / Federation or you are out of it. The only thing that voluntary treaties will lead into is fragmentation of the union and larger disharmony between member states as some states not participating into one aspect of the union will be seen as free riders.

There is already much talk about getting rid of countries that are not willing to go further in the integration road and those voices will only become louder in the coming years. Either you are in the monetary union and any union that is needed to make it work, or you are out of the union.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt; I (and apparently a lot of other Europeans) thought that the implied consensus was that the Southern European economies reform themselves sufficiently, in a small amount of time, and then once reformed Germany consents to issuing Eurobonds. I may be mistaken in this, but it appears that Germany until now has not gone out of its way to shatter this illusion.

You shouldn't take everything politicians say literally, especially not when they play a game of ""chicken"". That said, I don't think Germany will agree to (vanilla) Eurobonds specifically unless there is either an EU or Eurozone finance ministry that issues them for its own budget.

Merkel had always explicitly ruled out Eurobonds, there never was much room for interpretation. However, neither are Eurobonds the only way to resolve the current crisis in the short term or to prevent the next one in the long term, nor is Merkel the only one who has a say in this. And when she says something, she has to keep the FDP, the partner of her governing coalition, in mind. This coalition is generally seen as unstable and a failure, the FDP is struggling to remain politically relevant, and pretty hard line on this issue. In theory her conservatives could simply form a new coalition with the SPD (Social Democrats), we don't need a new election for that, but that would be a political loss for her and the SPD would not pass up the opportunity for new elections, in which they would do much better than in the last one -- and those two parties don't agree on how to deal with this, either.

The reason why Germany is so opposed to Eurobonds is that, in a pure form, it would mean to completely give up control. Issuing debt collectively without some *very* strict and enforced rules would be the same as handing out the credit card to a shared bank account. Vanilla Eurobonds would be final and unlimited. You know how much of a political issue the normal, very limited payments into the EU budget are not only in the UK. This is in an entirely different order of magnitude, unlimited even, and unlike the EU budget we wouldn't have a say in how it would be spent.  
Greece here serves as an example for why this wouldn't be such a smart move. That ""Greece is a special case"" isn't just something they say to calm markets, it really is. More on that later, for now let's focus on Greek politics. I think I'm quoting this for the third time already, but Syriza almost won on a platform that their European policy spokesman expressed as *""If we left the euro, the financial markets would attack Italy. If you owe 3000 euros to the bank and don't pay, they will kill you. If you owe 10 billion euros, they will do everything for you.""* But it's not just them. Now-PM Samaras did everything he could to block the bailout deal while he was in the opposition, and Venizelos isn't popular in the other European capitals, either. They passed the big ticket items that brought down spending figures at the last minute to unlock the next tranche of the bailout packet, but weren't exactly eager to get to work on all the difficult small stuff, the structural reforms that would reduce bureaucracy to make the economy more dynamic and to eliminate those small pockets of actual waste. I don't know if this specific one has been addressed already, because it went through the international media as an example, but they had (?) a committee to manage [a lake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Copais) that had been drained decades ago. Or, why do unmarried daughters need their dead father's pension, in the 21st century? (Again, media attention, may be resolved.)  
So, if the Greek government acts like this, even under threat of imminent catastrophic economic collapse, how are the odds they'll go against their clientele when there is absolutely nothing the other Eurozone members could do to, yes, coerce them into it, and if they were shielded from higher interest rates on top of that? If you *want* Euroskeptic populist parties to make governing in the Core countries de facto impossible, this is how you do it. And that's why Eurobonds, in a pure and unlimited form, are out as long as national governments have full budgetary sovereignty.

Anyway, there are two main dimensions to possible resolutions of the current crisis. Short term (""make it go away"") vs. long term prevention (""this must never happen again""), and self-interest of the relevant players.

The Southern Economies need to reform, period. They need to do it for themselves, and they need to do it for the stability of the whole. Governments generally try to avoid structural reforms, because by their very nature they always affect some groups negatively, and this means you lose voters. For example, when you remove the need to have one of a limited number of licenses to operate your trucking business, the truckers probably won't reelect you. That's why those kinds of reforms don't happen until they can't be put off any longer in a manner of ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"". For Germany, this was ten years ago, for some others it's now -- the problem is that this is a really bad time to do something like this, and that they have been pushed over the threshold where they must act far and forcefully, one way or the other, either through bursting housing bubbles or because Greece blew the effective lid off their interest rates. The reasons how they ended up in this situation are different, but it's by no means a coincidence that it all came at the same time, and not only because of the previous financial crisis.

So, generally, you need a stick for reforms to happen. Clearly, disorderly default and the total economic collapse that would follow are a large enough stick to abolish the need for a carrot. The bailouts aren't carrots, they're mainly happening because other members are standing close enough to get hurt when it gets wielded, and the core would be severely affected as well -- maybe not total economic collapse, but some pretty high economic and social costs none the less. Bailouts are cheaper, they buy the affected countries time to enact reforms, and they (are supposed to) limit contagion.  
The crisis itself is a stick to get the individual and sovereign nations of the EU in general and the Eurozone specifically to finally get to work on a long term solution. And yes, internal transfers of some sort need to be a part of it, but again, Eurobonds are far from the only option here, and not even a particularly good one.

Personally, I believe having some carrots would be more constructive than a stick-only policy in regards to mitigating the effects of the crisis in the short term, because they would help to reduce the social cost and because there's too much ""collateral damage"" to those countries' businesses that will be expensive to repair. It would also be a good opportunity to improve the EU's image in those countries, and it would give those governments more political capital to work with. Anyway, there seems to be some movement in this regard, like the recent ""big four"" agreement, weak as it may be, and I'm hoping for *something* to come out of this week's summit.

&gt; Further, why are Southern Europe allowing themselves to be picked off one-by-one instead of presenting a united front, calling Germany on their clearly untenable and much weaker than assumed position (essentially this whole mess is related to the masses of bad loans German banks issued), pulling the MAD trigger, and threatening to default *en masse*?

You mean, why don't they gang up and rob the bank? Because ""Greece is a special case"" again. You can think of it as the detonator to the Italian explosive package. The Italians aren't exactly keen for it to trigger. If it wasn't for the threat of a Greek default, which drove up their interest rates in the first place (apart from their high debt load, obviously, but nobody had been worrying about that before), there would be no risk of sudden large scale capital flight, and they'd have plenty of time to enact reforms in a socially much more palatable manner. They'd be crazy to heighten tensions right now and unnecessarily talk up default risk. They don't need this, and they're far too large to even hope for a bailout if the situation worsens.  
The situation is similar in Spain, even though the underlying problems are obviously very different. Portugal and Ireland are already under the umbrella and can avoid an escalation of their domestic problems as long as everybody chills the fuck out. What all this means is that they have an even greater interest in the Greek government getting its act together than the whole of the Eurozone has anyway.

A widely touted myth says True Finns, but actually it was SDP.

Already in spring 2010 SDP, then in opposition, demanded collateral for the first Greece-package. The original idea about collateral was not SDP's invention, it was first suggested by Ministry of Finance officials earlier in 2010. But the government (Conservative + Central party et al coalition) did not ask for collateral for the first Greece-bailout nor Portugal-package. 

And so collateral became SDP's agenda for opposition policy and election.

After 2011 election SDP became part of government coalition (Conservative Party + SDP et al). After negotiations new government's agenda was set accordingly and enter collateral. Now it's a law: any *temporary bailout fund* package must include collateral.

True Finns did nothing and their agenda was not to ask for a collateral. Their agenda was much simpler: no bailouts (and then what? you might ask. well, they can't or won't tell).",0,1340810342,null,0,false,0,c56arfj,t3_voer0,t1_c56arfj,t1_c569ezs,null,1429242556,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Under the terms of the fiscal stability treaty, they don't have full budgetary sovereignty any more:  any spending above the SGP agreed threshold for a country is subject to review by an external agency (details vague in the treaty text).

Is this enough?  If not, why bother with it at all?

&gt; The Southern Economies need to reform, period.

Lumping my country (Ireland) in with the Southern/Catholic/profligate axis for a while, I would say that the use of Greece as a template for S/C/p wastefulness is a masterstroke by German austerians.  Understandably, they want to take full advantage of Germany's structural edge and strong economy.  No politician ever lost votes by praising the thriftiness, hard work, national genius etc of his  electorate.  And sure, it seems that Greece was an extremely corrupt  country, inside and outside its public sector.  But the economic problems of Spain and Ireland are quite different, and have much to do with the macrodynamics of the euro economy.  For example, the money that Germans saved (thriftiness etc) was lent out in the most stupid and profligate manner by the German banks to fuel property bubbles on the periphery.  When the bubble burst it threatened to take down the banking systems of these countries, which was seen (rightly)  by the German financial and political elite as a massive threat to the German economy.  And so, the Irish and Spanish governments (not without their own quota of pro-EU servility and dishonesty) acquiesced in an effective transfer of this debt, off the balance sheets of the banks, and onto the balance sheets of the sovereign.

Now, of course, those sovereign balance sheets look like, and are, shit.  But this is not a direct result of fiscal irresponsibility by the governments concerned (leaving out Greece, the unrepresentative representative), but of a failure of regulatory systems, and ridiculous behaviour by banks (both domestic and foreign), who lent money to property schemes that in retrospect, never could have worked.  Is this the fault of the political systems in the peripheral countries?  Partly.  Is it the fault of the banking systems?  Mostly.  *Caveat emptor*, after all.

So basically, it seems to me that the German reaction to this crisis is to use the Greek example as a template for every state that is in trouble, because it's a simple morality tale that makes the Germans feel good about themselves, and because eliding the differences between the peripheral countries prevents some awkward questions from being asked about the conduct of German financial institutions before the crisis and their share of the blame for it. 

&gt; You mean, why don't they gang up and rob the bank?

Nope, not that.  A mass default would be one way of breaking up the eurozone.  If things don't turn around in the next year or so, this will become more likely.

&gt; Portugal and Ireland are already under the umbrella and can avoid an escalation of their domestic problems as long as everybody chills the fuck out.

I read a lot of this kind of stuff, mostly in the German media.  Let me tell you, domestic problems in Ireland are escalating, and have been for some time.  Emigration is up, bankruptcies and foreclosures are through the roof.  Youth unemployment is ridiculously high, but still lower than in Spain.  We are in the midst of a very serious crisis, and I have a feeling that things could get ugly soon.

I realise that things look different from the Protestant/Northern/frugal axis, and this is one of the problems.  Because reading the media in the PNf and the SCp would lead one to believe that there are two different Europes, in two different universes.  If we can't agree on the facts, what chance do we have?

Personally, I believe that the political basis of European Union, solidarity, has been [irretrievably destroyed](http://www.euronews.com/2011/12/05/schmidt-attacks-merkel-over-response-to-euro-crisis/) by a very [short-sighted and populist](http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/world/former-german-chancellor-criticizes-merkels-europe-course-60763.html) German administration, as well as the mendacity, laziness and stupidity of more than one southern European government.  One might argue that Merkel's government is merely doing what the German people want, in which case we're more screwed than I thought.

We can point the finger at each other at leisure when we're starting fires with bales of euro-notes.  I don't honestly think that anything other than a complete reboot of the European project can work at this stage.

Funding of EU structural and cohesion programs are not in question, all member states more or less share the opinion that they are needed and that they contribute to the overall growth of the European economy, at least with current amounts.

However bailout programs for Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Ireland aren't something that the member states have agreed from the get go. They have been set up hastily to shield the overall European economy from failure of individual member states. These failures go from a direct fraud committed by former Greek governments to long term structural inefficiencies of Greece and Spain and Portugal to short sighted basing of the economy to a property bubble in Spain and Ireland. These are failures that could have been prevented.

As an Finnish and European taxpayer I'm mortified by this incompetence and I want actions to be taken. If I could have decided I would have thrown out the labour legislation from the window and copy-pasted one from the US to these countries, state bureaucracy would also have been cut putting 20 - 50% of the employees out, benefits would have also been cut. 

The thing is, it is my money, its taxpayers money, and when taxpayers hand it to the government and to the EU, the money has to be used as wisely and as efficiently it can be. If it is wasted then my vote in the next elections go to a party that will decrease taxation and decrease government spending.

And you know what, I'm not ranting this because I want more money for myself, but because if money is wasted by the government, it means that there is less education, less health care, less social services to those in need.

The reason there are three appointees is purely for aesthetic purposes and to enable the quite common three-party coalitions to have each party represented. The U.S. Senate started out similarly but became more of an independent body as the importance of the federal level grew. But it was voluntary on the part of the states. 

2) That's certainly one philosophy, but I don't share it. The EU is already fragmented, with exceptions carved out for some states but not others. My proposal would simply formalize that and provide a framework for further integration on a case-by-case basis. As long as both the ""core"" and the ""periphery"" benefit from the arrangement, I see no reason to break it up. A Denmark without the Euro will benefit from the common market, but will be slightly penalized by having a different currency, encouraging them to eventually join it. A Poland which hasn't signed on to the agriculture package (because they don't want to eventually subsidize, say, Greek farmers and their products) is not going to get additional help for **its** farmers. And personally, I believe this approach will make full integration come about **more quickly**, because citizens of every European state will be able to become acclimated to it in bite-sized portions and see the distinct benefits and disadvantages as opposed to just the bureacratic monster of Brussels.

I beg to differ. Before the EU you needed visas to work, no free movement of capital. All merchandise needed to go through customs, and was taxed.

true,Kim147,UKGB,United Kingdom Thanks,"I would go back to the EC \ EEC - a loose trading block of states . All individual sovereignity would ultimately remain with the individual countries . Each country would be free to negotiate agreements with other countries . A lot of the international issues can be handled jointly via these agreements .

A good example is the Euro . There is no reason why countries can't dual currency . Money is just payment for hours worked - it is an exchange of those hours worked - that is it's inherrent value . The currencies in the individual countries could be free floated . If a person in the UK wants to buy a product in France their GBP's would be exchanged for FF's at the exchange rate and without any extra commission or charges . The UK government would negatively 'QE' out the GBP's and the French government would positively 'QE' in the FF's - after all that's where the value in the form of the money has been transfered - moving in the opposite direction to the transfer in value of the goods . The Euro would be used as an international , transnational and alternate internal currency .

There are a lot of things that we can do via a combination of international treaties and local versions of implementations . France already does this to a significant extent - just look at it's actions over Internet gambling versus what it is supposed to do according to the free cross border trade legislation and regulations of the EU .

Regarding the EU Commission and studies - in my opinion both are largely a waste of time and money . The only way that things can be developed and assessed is on the ground - everything else is often just pie in the sky and is very remote from reality . When France , The Netherlands , Ireland etc. voted against The Constitution \ The Lisbon Treaty the EU Commission didn't say ""well we got it wrong"" - which obiously they did - they said - ""you got it wrong - go back and vote again !"" - obviously a break down in democracy .

It makes no sense to increase the minimum wage in the time of crisis, because it is a well-studied rule that it's detrimental to employment rate. Increasing the price of labour decreases demand for it - basic economics, really.

Look guys, increasing the minimum wage only works if companies have extra money lying around and could pay employees more but don't. Needless to say, it isn't the situation right now. Many companies are already having trouble to break even, so increasing the cost of labour *will* get people fired and *will* make it more difficult for the unemployed to find jobs. 

Result: those lucky to keep their jobs will have it better, while the unemployed, who would have gladly taken the lower pay over no job at all, will have it even harder.

true,WalkerEU,CYPR,Cyprus,"Here's where the plan falls apart:

The current Cypriot government is AKEL (communist). I personally don't like this political party and they will DEFINITELY lose the next elections. Bailing out the banks more or less goes against their beliefs, but they want to try and do it with the least money possible. This party is the most (and probably only) anti-EU (yet do not openly show this all the time) party in the country.

The main opposition party, DISY (EPP sister party and most pro-EU), currently has the highest chances of winning the next elections and has a majority in parliament. They support austerity because AKEL hasn't been willing to mess with the public sector unions which are greedy.

Quite a lot of people (probably the majority) support austerity as long as it targets public sector spending (this increased spending was created by AKEL since they came in power -- Cyprus was running surpluses before them).

What worries me is that AKEL, being anti-EU, may withdraw its application and force a deal with Russia or China. Because they left it until the last minute, DISY -- which has the power to stop this, won't really have an option to block the deal as the money for the 2nd largest bank needs to be secured before the end of this month (just a few days).

Not letting a eurozone bank go under is in the interests of the whole eurozone. This party more than likely wouldn't mind letting the bank go under, but at least has to try to pretend that they care as they need the support of DISY to get anything done.

Long story short: The crazies are in power for the next 6-12 months. Right after this president's term is over and his immunity is lifted, he will likely be prosecuted for murder because of the Mari incident -- which he had a blame for according to an independent government-paid report. This should give you a rough idea of how unpopular he *PERSONALLY* is in the country -- but quite a few sheep still support the party.

As *ridiculous* as this sounds, the other eurozone partners are going to have to decide if they want a eurozone bank to go under or not. This government wouldn't REALLY care, and generally not bailing out banks is a very popular move everywhere. I suspect this is why they left it until the last minute. DISY has almost been begging them to sign up for an EU bailout since last month -- and looked forward to austerity being forced as the government doesn't wanna make cuts in the very thing that they themselves created (higher public sector bills).

What is required is for a nice deal to be made that implements the austerity that must be done. Stuff like this will only play chicken with the commies (crazies in this case).

P.S. There is no mechanism for removing a president from power, so we just have to hope this one doesn't create too much more damage by the end of his term in less than a year from now.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"Austerity is the responsible thing to do. The Finnish state has been continuously running some sort of austerity programs for the last decade. There is a long term state efficiency program that is designed to cut down number state employees while keeping the level of services in the same level. This is done by both not hiring new vacancies, firing old employees, reorganizing organizations and the work done, etc... This is a normal thing to do and the only way to keep the state efficient.

In the troubled countries, some need more austerity and some need less austerity, but for example Greece, there is no denying that there needs to be huge cut downs on the government in order to reorganize economy to be more productive. This is a key issue. 

You have to move people from unproductive work to more productive work, in some cases this can mean demotion for example from being an specialist to being for example cleaner, waiter or seaman. Of course it isn't nice to people that have to go it, but if they want something better, they have to reinvent themselves and their offering in the market to get better. This is what is needed.

If there is no austerity, then there will be no restructuring of the economy and that means that more and more money has to bumped in to keep the economy going as it is. That is waste and that needs to be cut down as soon as possible. It is irresponsible as it doesn't offer any way for the market to work and re-bounce.",0,1340816684,null,0,false,0,c56cef8,t3_voer0,t1_c56cef8,t1_c56c4i8,null,1435704965,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

1. Ancient Greece had seperate kingdoms and city-states all fighting each other, but they all had 3 things in common language, religion, traditions. Different people? No.
2. When Orthodoxy came to Greece and Great Roman empire failed the Byzantine was formed. Romans yes had effected Greece with their culture. Many greeks spoke latin as i meantion it was the second language for them.
3. The phrase '' Bulgarians and Greeks both calling themselves macedonian as a second title'' was going for ottoman ruling times. Dont mix things up. Ottomans wanted as many races as possible in every region to make it more difficult to uprise. There were vlachs, albanians, greeks, jews, turks, bulgarians, serbs no seperate macedonian nationality. I dont call myself turk, sorry to burst your buble, never my father and my grandfather called themselves turks regardless of the shit the feed you in the schools and tell you about your neighbors. You were under ottomans for 400 years too dont forget that. In contrary yours might have been calling themselves Bulgarians before Tito melted their brains as you guys speak the same language.
4. Exactly!!! Well done im really happy that you are finally accepting it. It wasnt only you if that makes you feel better. You should try and learn how the Yugoslavs were using education as political play ( in your case to attack Greece agean macedonia) in order to hold all the different nations and people with different culture and language under one barier. Yea all their nations were slavic but they still had  important differencies.
5. Thats the treatment you get bcz you are stealing our history. We dont hate macedonians we hate the fake ones (you). Hes armies (Alexanders) had soldiers from all states and he was aspiring warrior. No one had questioned him for 10 years of war. Thas a big achievement if you ask me as Spartans and Athenians were considered more faggys from the other greek tribes.
6. Yes, sadly for you, language and culture does make a nation. Very well-put example as todays Americans have nothing in common with the native ones in language and culture as you dont have nothing in common with the old ones. Homosexuality isnt something to be ashamed of. Alexander himself was bysexual. Are we still leaving in dark ages? oh nvm, Gruevski is still in power.
7. The name derives from ""Byzantium"", the name of the city of Constantinople which was considered in that time the cradle of Orthodoxy and Hellenism. Its considered greco-latin. Most educated world were speaking latin at that time as the Romans has conqured whole Europe and ofc left their mark.


Trying either to connect tzar Samuel and the four lions with the ancient Greeks or to recognise a separate language which is based on the literary traditions of Miladinovci and Cepenkov-both maintaining their language and culture was 
Bulgarian shows how absurd you people are.

Speaking of ""patriots""... how it it possible now that FYROM ultra nationalist have suddenly become descendents of ancient Macedonians (aka self-identifying Greeks) both the FYROM government and it's patronizing apologists have suddenly ""forgotten"" FYROM government's past identity claims? Bigots.

*""The creation
of the Macedonian nation, for almost half of a century, was done in a condition
of single-party dictatorship. In those times, there was no difference between
science and ideology, so the “Macedonian” historiography, unopposed by anybody,
comfortably performed a selection of the historic material from which the
“Macedonian” identity was created. There is nothing atypical here for the
process of the creation of any modern nation, except when falsification from
the type of substitution of the word “Bulgarian” with the word “Macedonian”
were made.""* (Denko Maleski, former Minister of foreign affairs of FYROM

Each country would be free to negotiate agreements with other countries . A lot of the international issues can be handled jointly via these agreements .

How is that different from my proposal other than built-in institutional support for those agreements (which, in the long run, would save money)? 

&gt; Regarding the EU Commission and studies - in my opinion both are largely a waste of time and money . The only way that things can be developed and assessed is on the ground - everything else is often just pie in the sky and is very remote from reality .

Some things benefit from a broader view devoid of naked national political interests. I fully support a strong European banking regulation agency, for instance, precisely for the reason that what little there was of European oversight before the crisis proved inadequate, and the national regulation agencies fared even worse, subject to the whims of politicians who just wanted to get reelected no matter the collateral damage. 

&gt; When France , The Netherlands , Ireland etc. voted against The Constitution \ The Lisbon Treaty the EU Commission didn't say ""well we got it wrong"" - which obiously they did - they said - ""you got it wrong - go back and vote again !"" - obviously a break down in democracy .

Sure. No one really disputes that. That set the cause of European integration back years, presenting the people with a highly flawed document and expecting them to say yes just because. But that's more pf a philosophical issue than a structural one; the structural problem with the EU is its weak democratic legitimacy. 

Ideally, a proper new constitution (or treaty) should be worked on with the involvement of the state and possibly even regional parliaments, with the European level as a co-ordinating instance.

The EU wastes huge amounts of money in :-

1) bureaucracy .

2) mismanagement .

3) fraud .

The EU auditors have never been prepared to sign off the accounts - far too much money disappearing . The closer you get the control and management of the spending to the source of the money the more efficiently that money will be spent .

&gt; ... banking ...

I don't disagree with good banking regulation - it was part of the cause of the economic crisis along with governments massively overspending etc. . However the regulation went very well in the individual countries before the repeal of the Glass-Steagall type legislations around the world . I don't see the EU doing it any better . The assumption that the Eurocrats will be any better is a complete misnomer - it's like the misnomer that fedualists have that they are somehow morally better .

&gt; The Constitution \ The Lisbon Treaty ...

No , it's not a philosphical issue , far from it , it's a lot of very practical on the ground issues - ask the average EU citizen - if they are prepared to speak to you . Enforcing it on the citizens of the EU only greatly weakens the 'democratic legitimacy' . The EU does not have a single demos . It has to be as per it's history - each country existing as per their own individual identity - playing their own part and playing their own way and being responsible forthemselves . 

It is vitally important that consequencies are not remoted from actions - this is deadly as we see only too well as the mistakes of history are being repeated yet again .

You're already seeing the Eurozone countries coming together to form closer bonds and stricter regulation just for the Eurozone. So a signature to the banking treaty would be a prerequisite to join the Euro treaty, but not the other way round. Sweden and Poland could join the banking treaty and benefit from the oversight and fiscal rules, and the Eurozone countries would benefit from additional partners who would also contribute to the new regulator's budget.  

That's something that would have to be worked out, naturally, and I'm not saying it's particularly easy to make these determinations which treaties need to be treated as a package in which situation. But the participating countries have an interest in keeping freeloaders out and wouldn't let them join if the benefit was purely one-sided. Accession to a treaty requires unanimity.

Plus its contrary to the parliamentary practices in most member countries. And veto powers to the most sensitive position of all, power-abuse-wise? Suggestion worthy of a  civil war, and again totally contrary to the parliamentary practice in member countries.

Or the short constitution. Shared competencies allow for the relatively decentralized federal level that can still be effective. But requre being explicit about each individual competency. 

Or really anything in this model. It would be the death of any democracy we have in EU institutions.

EDIT: didn't even see that gem - negotiates budget with states. parliaments should have the budgetary power if they're to be worth anything, and european one has a limited form of it. NOT having the EU funded by merely voluntary contributions of the states was explicitly selected by Schumann and specifically because that gives them an extra-legal leverage of just refusing to pay (like w UN). whereas, the parliament should be representing the citizen's interests freely. It was the experience with such weak international organisations like Council of Europe and United Nations that drove many of the more federalist aspects of EU's construction, and this is one.

EDITn: And not unifying election laws for the parliament when writing a constitution is a missed opportunity of high significance to the quality of democracy in europe - it is a unitary house representing the people of europe as a whole - so shouldn't be a heterogeneous body. At least on EU level, we shouldn't suffer the innanity of terrible election systems like closed lists or d'Hondt. And proportionality should be ensured EU-wide, calculating it per state makes the overall result not proportional. So there needs to be at least some EU-wide compensation seats. around 10-30% of the house..

EDITn+1 and why limit the access to the constitutional court so it again depends on that autocratic president of yours?

As someone from a country that had an autocratic fool for a president, I assure you, this imperial president is a terrible idea.

And mini-parliaments for each extra treaty sound like a proliferation of buerocracy, yet unjustified since the parliament as it is should represent the EU in total and its interests. Since they need to judge enhanced cooperation as in EU-wide interest to begin with (why else charge the comission or this 'state that's me' president of yours with executing it)

true,TerribleTacoBak,null,null,"&gt; The EU wastes huge amounts of money in 

There are governments wasting huge amounts of money all over Europe, but in total numbers, the current EU isn't one of them. Their budget is tiny. That doesn't mean that there's no fraud or mismanagement or redundant bureaucracy. Those exist everywhere. The solution isn't a European superstate, I think I agree with you there. That's why I modeled my proposal after the early United States, with a central government with very limited competences and everything else (including cometences the EU already has today) going back to the states unless they choose to opt in. It's designed to provide more transparency as to where the money is going and more control by the stakeholders who provide that money. 

&gt; I don't see the EU doing it any better .

There are three reasons why a Europe-wide regulatory agency might do things better: 

* It's new, which means you can build as much transparency as possible in from the get-go. 
* The economy isn't limited state-by-state, it's at the very least European (global, really). And the banks are so entangled that national agencies just can't oversee everything because their jurisdiction stops at the border. But the banks' business doesn't. 
* The national agencies are entrenched and beholden to national political interests. The new agency wouldn't be, provided it is actually independent. They could therefore be more aggressive and strict than their national counterparts, who may be afraid of pissing off the wrong banker. 

We won't know if that's how it'll work out. But I think it's worth a shot. Unless, of course, you want to go back to last century and break the multi-national banks into tiny pieces forced to operate only in their country of origin, in blatant violation of the common European market and the fact that other countries won't do that, leaving yours behind. 

&gt; Enforcing it on the citizens of the EU only greatly weakens the 'democratic legitimacy' .

I don't see any disagreement. I agree with you that the way the original constitution was attempted to be shoved down people's throats was wrong. I have also said that anything new would have to be developed from the ground up. In the purely hypothetical case that my proposal were to be taken up by the European elite, I would have no problem with having referenda in every single state, implementing the new structures only in states that say yes. 

&gt; The EU does not have a single demos .

I think you're wrong about that. The current members of the European Union **do** have a shared history and common values both historical (Christian) and present (Enlightenment).

I don't know about your monitor, but mine shows arrows designating how the different branches interact. 

&gt; And the parliamentary right of nomination makes no sense at all - why even restrict it like that.

It's a suggestion that already exists, coupling the European elections with the selection of the leader of the European Commission. The reason I did it that way (nomination of several candidates by the Parliament) was to ensure that any President would be qualified and have some backing within the Parliament, and to make the actual election process easier by having the same ballot (with instructions in the local language) in every country. It's a new position, after all; the American President wasn't always quite elected the way he is now either. The system could become more relaxed over time and allow every European to put himself on the ballot. 

&gt; Plus its contrary to the parliamentary practices in most member countries.

True, and absolutely intentional. Parliamentary systems work very well when it comes to governing by legislating, but in my proposal, it's not really the President's job to legislate. The EU is not a superstate. The President is a co-ordinator, supervisor and administrator. 

&gt; And veto powers to the most sensitive position of all, power-abuse-wise? Suggestion worthy of a civil war, and again totally contrary to the parliamentary practice in member countries.

I can't follow you here at all. The entire European level has very little inherent power to begin with. The President's veto is there to prevent abuse of power by the Parliament (and the presidents in lots of countries have effective or sort-of veto powers, even where they're only ceremonial like in Germany). 

&gt; didn't even see that gem - negotiates budget with states. parliaments should have the budgetary power if they're to be worth anything, and european one has a limited form of it.

I think you misread both the graphic and my joking comment. Under the proposal, the EU would have a budget of at least 1% EU GDP, and more if Parliament can get it (hence ""negotiate"", which may have been poorly chosen). The member states already haggle and complain about who contributes how much and in what form (import taxes and the like). Any determination of that under the proposal would have to involve the voluntary treaties, which, being administered under an EU umbrella, would be associated with some additional administrative cost.

It actually is true that tourist, education and working visas are a separate issue. It is true that free trade is a separate issue. It is also true you can have those things without a common currency. So yes they are separate.   

Now regarding your common market, if you want extreme regulation down to the minor details of everything, like the exact dimensions of fruit and vegetables and what is the true definition of a soft drink or whatever then you are entitled to your madness but that doesn't mean it has to be spread to everyone else. For the rest of us we are content with ""don't put anything in the food that will harm people and put a list of the ingredients on the package"". We don't need little traffic lights to show us how local the food is, or how fattening it is or how many dolphins were saved in the process of making it. If the market wants that they will get it (""dolphin free"" type packaging came from public pressure). You can buy wine from everywhere in the world, and there are plenty of first world workers with all sorts of benefits in Australia and New Zealand who sell it and there are plenty of third world countries like Argentina and South Africa who sell it. Further, there are plenty of EU countries who sell it. There is no reason why these countries need to have more than just simple regulations to achieve fair competition. If you want to have some ""right to marshmallows"" or whatever other silly stuff, that's your problem, that's your cost. It shouldn't be imposed on me just because you think it should.

Huge portions of the world run on free trade and not customs unions/common markets. And there are many examples of visa deals of all sorts, many examples of people cooperating on policies without a common parliament just by negotiation. These are separate issues and you are just deluding yourself if you think they *have* to be all tied up together for us to be friends, allies and trading partners. This is the paper thin argument that ""the project is irreversible"". I remember hearing the euro was irreversible, we shall see about that shortly. More to the point, you live or grew up near enough to Switzerland to know it's not some backwards Somalia of the hills.

true,Kim147,UKGB,United Kingdom Thanks,"How much money is wasted in the CAP ? how much in olive oil frauds ? and various other frauds ?

If , instead of Italy giving it's EU contribution to the EU and then the EU then spending it back in Italy , Italy just kept hold of the money itself and spent it the best way it saw fit I'm sure that waste and fraud would be greatly minimised .

Politicians and bureaucrats love spending money that is not theirs and because it's not theirs they are far less careful in spending it .

Regarding national agencies being beholden - the UK has a very professional public service , it certainly is not perfect , it certainly was politicised under the socialist labour government but a lot of that damage is being repaired .

International agencies are not automatically not beholden . They become very much beholden to transnational interests . A good example is how the UN has become corrupted by environmental interests , particularly by the AGW proponents . Environmentalism has become very much a driving force for world government . The big problem with governments that are very remote from the people that they are governing is that they , by the nature of the size of the population , become very unaccountable - they are far too remote and they have not a clue what reality is . The people do not have much knowledge on the people that they are voting for and much choice in who they vote for .

Demos' require common language , common culture , common values , common perceptions , common narratives . Yes Europeans have a lot in common but they are not a common demos . The difference between the Germans and the Greeks is a classic case in point . If the Greeks were not accepted into the Euro , if they had full control and responsibility for their own economic situation their situation could have been sorted out at far less cost than it is going to cost all of us .

As for Fedualism and The Enlightenment the countries of Europe each have their own history and situations . France had it's revolution but ended up with a very patrimony based society - very different from Britain . Britain very much embraced The Enlightenment - it was a key part of the industrial revolution . Germany and other countries in Europe such as Belguim had their less bloody revolutions . There was also the Reformation - the splitting off of the protestant churches from the Catholic church - this is a major part of European history and is a difference between countries . And then there is the new world - the USA coming from the Enlightenment , the Reformation , Democratic Capitalism , and the other new world countries in the Anglo world plus the Porteguese and Spanish countries .

Feudalism very much [reinvented itself](http://www.martindurkin.com/blogs/nazi-greens-inconvenient-history) in a number of modern forms . These days it makes itself synonymous with the state and particularly with large countries and transnational bodies .

Britain is very much an individual case - the individual countries of the UK all have a common language and much of a common shared history . We are a demos . And there has been devolution of powers over the last decade plus into the individual countries - the opposite of what you are proposing .

Anyway , enough said , I must have dinner .

They also guarantee you do not have to pay a supplement until 2014, while the AOK only guarantees it for 2012 (and 2013 in some locations) and offer special conditions to students (for instance, under certain circumstances, they pay you bonuses for doing sports, which can help pay them).

Standard price (which is identical for all public service health care providers) for students is 76.41 euros/month if you're under 23, and 77.90 euros/month otherwise.

You could go to a private insurance company, but I wouldn't recommend it, as they will generally cost more. When comparing keep in mind the prices above are for Kranken- and Pflegeversicherung, while private companies generally only give prices for the Krankenversicherung but you need to have a Pflegeversicherung with them, too (by law).",0,1340824997,null,0,false,0,c56eonz,t3_vosil,t1_c56eonz,t1_c56c9j5,null,1429244230,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

ah, then they don't interact much. Nothing but impeachment can remove a president? not even a recall referenda? really? not even a supermajority in the parliament??

&gt; It's a suggestion that already exists, coupling the European elections with the selection of the leader of the European Commission. 

You mean, the **election** of the European Comission president in the Parliament, which isn't a 'suggestion', but right there in the Lisbon Treaty?

&gt;Parliamentary systems work very well when it comes to governing by legislating, but in my proposal, it's not really the President's job to legislate. The EU is not a superstate. The President is a co-ordinator, supervisor and administrator. 

This isn't particularly coherent - first no parliamentary system has a president legislating, yet all have an executive subject to parliamentary approval and censure. And ofc EU legislates, there's pages and pages of european laws, just implementing the directives is a mountain that took croatia's parliamentry system for years to implement. And most of it is laws applicable to any European Economic Area member, so even the most loosly integrated countries implement a veritable mountain of european law. and a fair portion of european law aren't directives even, but 'regulations', directly applicable law voted in the european parliament.

&gt; The President's veto is there to prevent abuse of power by the Parliament (and the presidents in lots of countries have effective or sort-of veto powers, even where they're only ceremonial like in Germany). 

In fact the current Comission has the power of withrawing a law or not initiating one as demanded by either the parliament or the upcomming citizen initiative. And this is one of the most problematic parts of the current system, democracy-wise. 

&gt;is there to prevent abuse of power by the Parliament 

you have an upper house of the parliament to represent the interests of the countries, and a lower one ofc to represents the european populace as a whole. 

Yet the most democratically problematic body, gets to veto both? in the name of who? corporate interests or corruption possibly, but for what other end...

But in any case, the president has the powers to send a bill to a second hearing or second vote with ordinary majority or popular referenda or constitutionality check in varying european countries.

Well, I gather except for Poland and Ukraine, which need supermajorities. great models.

And since you've allowed for further integration of an interested group of countries, there's no reason to expect EU level is fairly powerless. If there is a thing like a monetary union within it, that EU level is to have fiscal and monetary powers of significant extent. And economy is what most politics is fought over anyway.

&gt;The member states already haggle and complain about who contributes how much and in what form (import taxes and the like). 

sure, but they can't overrule required majorities in both houses if those wish to increase the budget. Well, they do unfortunately have a veto over multi-annual framework.

&gt; Any determination of that under the proposal would have to involve the voluntary treaties, which, being administered under an EU umbrella, would be associated with some additional administrative cost. 

so, an effective veto for each country. which pretty much neuters the parliament of any political power or significance, since the member states, esp rich ones can bully it as they please.

Currently they only need agree over the tax or 'own sources' shapes and maximal caps.",0,1340825045,null,0,false,0,c56ep49,t3_vno0o,t1_c56ep49,t1_c56e4zr,null,1429244238,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

&gt; Our system has produced a stable-nation

That's relative I think. The EU could be as stable as the US if we would have twice as much countries as we have now. It's always funny how Americans say that the economical big EU countries profit too much from the weak countries because those would pull down the currency rate. They are basically right but how can your ""stable nation"" have an even cheaper currency if you wouldn't do the same? Like you said. 5% of the earth's population and 1/5 of every good the world has. You basically do the same. See the states as one country and you have the same scenario as we have in the EU (with less independent governments).

And you can stop the ""hur dur we are only 5% of the population but so wonderful"" bullshit. The biggest part of the population lives in poor as fuck countries and those are to be ignores in such comparisons. They are basically statistical outliers (please, no offence if you are from a poor country. I'm talking about statistics here. You're as important as people from wealthier countries) or we are statistical outliers if you would prefer it this way.

So the first paragraph is pretty much bollocks because it doesn't say more then, ""you work a lot"", which has nothing to do with the system. But I could tell you how bad your social supports are compared to Europe if you want?

For the next part: I think the constitution is old. It needs an update. Allowing people to buy almost every weapon based on a law that was made when weapons in comparison to today were very inaccurate and just in general worse and not as effective, is just madness. But since there are a lot of differences in our cultures, I won't comment on that and just leave it.

I also don't think that I have to read books written by philosophers to detect a broken system. In face, since we have now the internet, I just have to go to /r/politics and facepalm a lot about what happens in America. But again, politicians are not really something that affects the political system.

And why should I ""study"" the Chinese (ex-communistic country. Probably the worst nation every at the moment), Russian (as well as china an ex-communistic country), Nigerian (3rd world. We had that before), Mexican (I'd call it almost a third world country. Every country where people are climbing on driving trains to get into another country is 3rd world for me but I don't know if there is an official classification and if Mexico is a part of it), Iran (Haven't you exported democracy yet? I have no idea about Iran but if it is just slightly similar to extreme religious countries like Saudi Arabia, it is still not comparable) or the constitution of the UK? Only the UK is comparable and I doubt that it is much different from the German one which means that there are again a bunch of culture differences compared to the USA.

You pretty much left out everything that affects the political system directly. The problem is basically your voting system, the 2 party system and so on. But I doubt that I need to write more about that to a butt hurt American. That pretty much sounded like you are just mad because people don't think you're beloved nation is not the best.

Open up a historical trend, and you'll see that /r/politics would have been complaining about very different things in the 80's and the 70's and the 60's.

I'm telling you to study these governments precisely because they're 3rd world, precisely because they're so different. You will not learn the grand themes of governance by looking at similar countries. **Nigeria** can teach you about (real) corruption and about the defects of federalism.** Russia**'s government will tell you how a semi-presidential government works, like France's, but in extreme forms of corrpution. **China** can teach you about how a real communist government works. **Iran** has a complex, completely alien system that you might not even be able to comprehend- but still, you should try. (and the fact that you thought it was like Saudi Arabia's makes me lose faith in you... if I had to choose between them, I would choose Iran's in a heartbeat). **Mexico**'s Constitution is derived from the US's, but also from some European ideals. Finally, the **UK** should be used because, they, unlike yours, do not have a written Constitution or what that was forced upon them.

**tl;dr: I'm not really trying to teach you anything, but I'm trying to point you in the right direction while restraining myself from going uber-patriotic and razing Berlin. Learn about *weird* countries, learn why they have those kinds of governments, and what those governments mean, and then we can talk.**",0,1340828415,null,0,false,0,c56fmx1,t3_vno0o,t1_c56fmx1,t1_c56f5ta,null,1429244766,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3
true,Kim147,UKGB,United Kingdom Thanks,"PS : can I give one classic example where One top down Europe goes very wrong and that is with labour market flexibility . In the UK we have the classic contractors , temps , casual staff and full time employees . Each serves a very important part of the economy . None are actually exploited , they have work - which is better than no work . Contractors , for example , earn a good income when the economy is healthy and they are more likely to be in work when it isn't .

Labour market flexibility means that companies can easily ramp up when the economy is picking up and they can handle downturns . When an economy downturns the last thing that a company can afford is expensive labour costs - they are much more likely not to employ .

A contractor in the UK is a small business person . They have a different arrangement than an employee . They can't claim unemployment benefit , holiday and sick pay . They have to take care of their retirement contributions . They often don't work a full year . In return they can claim their business costs and they pay lower tax rates - small business rates .

In the UK contractors are often taken on for specific projects - they are a resource . On the continent they are often used to avoid the social chapter . In the UK the contracts are often much shorter than they are on the Continent .

Many of the countries on the Continent have what's called the 183 day rule . This means that if a contractor works 183 or more days in any one country they have to work that contract through an umbrella company . This means that for most Continental contracts the contractor more than doubles their non subsistence costs - typically at 43% - versus 18 to 20% . It also means that when a contractor works via an umbrella company out of their home country they cause huge problems with their social benefits in their home country , particularly with their retirement benefit . When they finish their contract they go straight back to their home country and they do often not draw on social benefits in their host country .

Continental clients do pay a higher rate - the rate is forced up because of the extra costs and , that in turn , adds to their costs . However over the course of the economic crisis they have driven down the rate . A lot of the contractors on the Continent are UK contractors - because of how big our contracting sector is - ie. the economic culture is there . The economy in the UK has been picking up well , especially in the first half of the year , although the second half may well be different . What this has all meant is that UK contractors , whilst being paid less in gross terms than on the Continent are paid more in net terms . Hence many UK contractors have been staying in the UK and Continental clients are having big problems getting staff .

What this all means is that flexible economies like in the UK are able to far more easily and quickly recover from the economic crisis . Continental countries , on the other hand , will probably stagnate for 10 to 15 years at least . And will the Continental countries adopt flexible work practices ? - unlikely unless they see other countries succeeding with them - and that's where the whole situation comes down to . If you have a 'One Europe' doing things wrong and seeing no different they will not change . If , however , they are diverse they will see what works and can adopt it . However this means a diversified and localised Europe - not a 'One Europe' .

true,TerribleTacoBak,null,null,"&gt; Nothing but impeachment can remove a president? not even a recall referenda? really? not even a supermajority in the parliament??

The President is one person, elected directly; representatives are directly elected only in the first chamber (and possibly not even that in some cases), and in many cases will have gotten into parliament via party lists. It makes sense to make it more difficult to get rid of him. It works okay in the United States (where the President has **significantly** more power). According to (a very cursory look at) Wikipedia, impeachment works much the same way in Croatia. 

&gt; You mean, the election of the European Comission president in the Parliament, which isn't a 'suggestion', but right there in the Lisbon Treaty?

No, I was referring to the recent calls for a sort-of direct election of the president of the European Commission by having all of the political blocs say before the parliamantary election who they intend to vote for, making the European election a presidential election-by-proxy. That doesn't require a treaty change, but it's still not the way it is handled now. 

I wanted to give the President additional legitimacy beyond that and therefore removed the ""proxy"", leaving only the nomination in the hands of the Parliament. 

&gt; And ofc EU legislates, there's pages and pages of european laws, just implementing the directives is a mountain that took croatia's parliamentry system for years to implement.

I didn't dispute that the EU legislates now and would of course continue to do so under my proposal, through directives and regulations. My problem has been for years that the Commision and the Council of Ministers have too much power relative to the European Parliament (Lisbon improved this a little, but not enough), and I sought to address that by focusing much of the legislative thrust into the Parliament. 

&gt; And most of it is laws applicable to any European Economic Area member, so even the most loosly integrated countries implement a veritable mountain of european law. 

Currently, yes. The proposal would roll some of that back. It may be wishful thinking, but a sort-of-new start may also be an opportunity to clean house and get rid of regulations that aren't necessary and/or are better handled on a state or regional level. 

&gt;  Yet the most democratically problematic body, gets to veto both? in the name of who? corporate interests or corruption possibly, but for what other end...

You keep saying that the only directly elected institution is the most democractically problematic. How so? And any veto can be overriden by a supermajority; budget bills can't be vetoed at all. 

&gt; But in any case, the president has the powers to send a bill to a second hearing or second vote with ordinary majority or popular referenda or constitutionality check in varying european countries.

I'm not really opposed to incorporating something like that. It's a thought experiment, not dogma. I wrote it down within a couple hours and with heavy influence from the American constitution (which, in general, did a pretty good job of keeping its country together and somewhat functional). It certainly can be improved. 

&gt; And since you've allowed for further integration of an interested group of countries, there's no reason to expect EU level is fairly powerless. If there is a thing like a monetary union within it, that EU level is to have fiscal and monetary powers of significant extent. And economy is what most politics is fought over anyway.

The chart describes the base level which applies to everyone. That's why the committees exist, which very well may have different rules; they just have to be written into the respective treaty. 

Of course, the more power a body has, the more important it is that checks and balances exist as well. That's why there's a President at all and why he's elected on a European level, not just by Parliament. 

&gt; so, an effective veto for each country. which pretty much neuters the parliament of any political power or significance, since the member states, esp rich ones can bully it as they please.

No. Again: The proposed reformed EU **has** a minimum budget, with revenues coming from import taxes and other contributions (as determined by independent auditors). There would be very little change from today in this respect. The reason I mentioned the additional treaties is that they represent an additional problem of figuring out what a fair allocation is. And I think it's only fair for individual countries to make their case in an institutional setting, which is also what countries already do on an intergovernmental basis. It adds transparency to a process that typically isn't today and will make it less easy to complain about how ""Brussels is wasting all our hard-earned moneys"". ""Negotiate"" was a poor choice of words, and if I make an amended version of the chart, I'll change it.

I don't doubt there is waste and even fraud.

&gt; If , instead of Italy giving it's EU contribution to the EU and then the EU then spending it back in Italy , Italy just kept hold of the money itself and spent it the best way it saw fit I'm sure that waste and fraud would be greatly minimised .

No offense to any Italians reading this, but that was probably not the best example you could have chosen...

&gt; There was also the Reformation - the splitting off of the protestant churches from the Catholic church - this is a major part of European history and is a difference between countries .

Well that's obviously bullshit in the context of this discussion. The fault line of the reformation runs **right through Germany**. Christianity is the common thread to all European countries, and the experience of the denominational wars is also part of that history, regardless of which side of the divide you ended up on. Not to mention that denominational particulars matter less and less as time goes on and more people become secular. 

&gt; International agencies are not automatically not beholden .

That's certainly true, but the pressure on them is different from the pressure on national agencies. Sure the latter are closer to what is actually being regulated, but they're also closer to people who want the regulators to look the other way. 

&gt; The big problem with governments that are very remote from the people that they are governing is that they , by the nature of the size of the population , become very unaccountable - they are far too remote and they have not a clue what reality is . The people do not have much knowledge on the people that they are voting for and much choice in who they vote for .

I agree with that, and the solution is more transparancy, more accountability, and more devolution. What can be done on the local level should be done on the local level, and so on for regional, national, and European levels. We'll have to agree to disagree on the wisdom of having bird's eye view co-ordinating institutions at the top who at the very least perform the occasional audit. 

&gt; Demos' require common language , common culture , common values , common perceptions , common narratives .

Europeans have all that, including a common language. It's called English, is taught in every single school, and is the primary working language of most of the European institutions already (much though the French may gripe about that). Europeans may not have a common mother tongue, but that's not as much of a problem as you seem to think. There are native speakers of Sorbian and Danish and Frisian in Germany. There are native speakers of Italian and Romansh and French in Switzerland. There are native speakers of Galician and Occitan and Basque in Spain. I could go on.

So people are all meeting these regulations anyway, and internationally negotiated ones will be sensible and minimal. People who want ridiculous regulations will have products unavailable to them, tough luck. It's clearly most sensible for the vast majority of these regulations to be negotiated globally. And the standards can have gradients too, so that higher and lower standards can be included in the global regulations without binding everyone.

And you are kidding yourself if you think even half these regulations from the EU are necessary or good. Most are just make-work programs for civil servants or lobbyists exporting their costs onto their competitors. I don't believe anyone who says these things are good has actually looked at the regulations themselves, unless you've actually been to Brussels and seen these people in action writing regulations about things which they know nothing about you haven't got a clue. Norway and Switzerland follow a minimal set of them for the things they actually need, and they pay minimal fees. That's how it should be for everyone, paying about 5% of what we currently pay for a forum, not a parliament, to negotiate sensible standards.  

It's not up to me to make the case that your common market stuff is silly. It's up to you to make the case that Switzerland and Norway are basket cases like your silly euro project.

So? What's wrong with keeping a constitution up to date. I have already told you that I think that your constitution is outdated in my opinion and I already gave you an example.

So a problem is not a problem if it isn't 30 years old?

We thought Hitler would be a temporary problem as well. And since you've already mention all the stuff you've faced (which was mostly war) I've got to ask myself how the current government can just ignore that and goes on with wars (I criticise my government for joining the US in that)

And there is still no valid argument why I should read those constitutions. It would be worth reading if I would be interested in politics in general.

&gt; and the fact that you thought it was like Saudi Arabia's makes me lose faith in you

I said that I have no idea how Iran is and ""if it is SLIGHTLY similar to Saudi Arabia..."" was what I actually wrote. Canada is also slightly similar to the USA but it's still very very different.

And, as you may know, Iran is actually a islamic republic. Government and religion build one unit and laws are taken from islamic traditions and from the Koran. [That](http://prophetofdoom.net/The_Little_Green_Book_1_03.Islam) was provided as a source on the German wikipedia. Which puts Iran exactly next to Saudi Arabia on my list of countries that are reigned by extremists which makes it slightly similar.

And still... Like magister0 you completely ignored the problems I've got with the political system of the USA I don't know why that is. Are you just butt hurt that I don't accept your country as the world greatest nation? Or do you just live in the past and want to ignore everything that is going on today?

Politicians are not polymaths. They may have expertise in one or more fields but they certainly aren't competent in all areas in which they are making decisions (this is to be expected, nobody is genius enough to have such general expertise). Instead you have a civil service, expert panels, lobbyists, etc who provide this expertise. They do the research, then they present a small range of options to the politicians who then select one and have it implemented. You don't get to vote for these experts. Irrespective of where you put your tick on the ballot box the the same options are going to be presented. 

This leads to a situation where those generating policy aren't elected and those who are elected and supposed to be determining policy don't have sufficient expertise to adequately assess the options given to them. That, in my opinion, is the major reason that the ballot box does not create great changes in government policy.

Banks don't want to loan because the economy is bad. Austerity makes the economy worse. How is that going to solve the problem?

A better solution would be for the European Central Bank to actually do it's job and defend the useful of the euro by printing more money and allowing a slight increase in inflation. This would help resolve internal imbalances without years and years of grueling ""internal devaluation"".

For one, there is much less of a taboo on working with the far right. We used to have a cordon sanitaire too, back in the 80s when the far right just meant Hans Janmaat holding a seat in parliament. But when the List Pim Fortuyn broke through in 2002 it was on such a massive scale that it was instantly accepted into government (which promptly fell apart a year later). The Freedom Party was of course also accepted, not as a full coalition partner but as an external supporter with significant influence on policy, from 2010 til it blew up the coalition earlier this year.

Granted, I believe the Sweden Democrats are more extreme than our far right (is that right?), but I was still not happy about how quickly the mainstream parties here adopted much of its language and ideas.

The other difference, as you point out, is that the blocks aren't nearly as united here, so there is much less of a left vs right mobilization. It's only really been this year that the Labour Party has embraced the Socialists as strategic partner rather than as a dangerous populist competitor it looked down upon, for example. But in exchange, the Green Left and the Democrats have been moving right, and it is especially hard to imagine the latter working with the Socialists. 

In a way, Dutch politics this decade has been as much about pitting the 'established' parties in the center, with long histories, moderate positions and a pro-EU orientation, against the new, populist protest parties on the far right and left, with their working class appeal and Euroscepticism.

But even smack in the center of our political landscape there are cultural irreconcilabilities. If you posit Dutch parties on a one-dimensional left vs right axis, the Democrats and the Christian Union basically occupy the same spot right in the middle, but they're in many ways each other opposites. One is a deeply religious, culturally conservative party with a strong emphasis on community cohesion and an overwhelmingly rural and small town electorate; the other is the country's most secular and individualist party, with an overwhelmingly upper-income urban, cosmopolitan electorate.

The result is a glass half full. On the downside (from my perspective), the Netherlands has never once had an actual left-wing government, for example. The perennial need for compromise and consensus in a country that long had a structural center-right majority meant progress was always incremental at best. On the upside, obviously, the capacity for harm was also always checked. The need for continuous negotiation and sometimes innovative coalitions long prevented a US-type bitter partisan cleavage, and even now the kind of mutual revulsion that seems to mark many Republicans and Democrats in the US is mostly limited to the mutual disdain between Freedom Party supporters on the one hand and Labour/Green Left/Democrats voters on the other. Finally, this need for continually seeking allies kept politicians willing to entertain the ideas of even unlikely allies (eg the current collaboration between VVD and Green Left).",0,1340841721,null,0,false,0,c56ixmx,t3_votoy,t1_c56ixmx,t1_c56fzlp,null,1429246313,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

In the long term, however, the affects on employment are believed to be largely overstated, because corporate pay structures are malleable over the long term. If a company makes $100M for the year, they will try to pay the investors whatever they are expecting, they will pay the low-level employees what they are willing tolerate (which is usually set by a minimum wage or unions), and then they will pay the upper-level employees whatever is left over (i.e. whatever the company can afford) in order to attract the best management. 

Without an effective minimum wage, the corporate pay structure becomes ridiculous. Just take a look at the CEO-to-average worker ratios - most of Europe and Asia is between 10:1 - 40:1, while the U.S. is well over 200:1. 

So in the short term, yes, raising the minimum wage can affect employment levels, but if an industry needs X amount of people to do the lower-level work, and all businesses in the industry must pay these people the same rate, the businesses eventually restructure their pay as necessary (paying high-level managers less and lower-level employees more).

A sizable chunk of the population *does* make below living wage though, and personally, I'm a big fan of bumping the minimum wage up to near-living-wage (which would have the effects on pay structure I've described). 

But pay structures aside, if a job can't be done for a living wage, hell - go ahead and automate it. If it can't be automated and you need an actual living, breathing human being to a particular job full-time, pay them what it costs to live. It's common sense; if you don't, they're either going to dig themselves into debt, or rely on heavy government aid. If the end result is that my tomatoes cost a bit more, so be it.

That said, you're 100% spot-on about now being the worst time to try to accomplish this, which I suppose is a bit more relevant to the article anyway. Having stagnant people is horrible for the economy and dehumanizing for those affected.

true,executivemonkey,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt;But even that doesn't make any sense, since we know that the German national identity and the ""unified German culture"" only really came in to being during the 20th century.

Contemporary German culture evolved from various cultures that preceded it, including modern Protestantism (modern as opposed to contemporary).  In other words, the Protestant influence, as I understand it, occurred most significantly before the 20th century and before the formation of modern Germany; it occurred in certain of the various precursor cultures that you were talking about, like the independent states that later unified to become Germany.

&gt;In as far as there is a common German identity and culture its roots are not as simple as being ""Protestant"". At what point would Protestantism ever had time to get a hold off and so completely dominate all of Germany's culture and identity as you posit?

I never said that German culture evolved solely from Protestantism; instead, I said that Protestantism ""heavily affected"" or ""strongly affected"" German culture.  Specifically, I am referring to the Protestant belief in hard work and austere living as a virtue.

&gt;There is only a common German culture in the same way there is a common American one: each state has its own, and they all add to the whole.

I don't agree with this.  As far as the US is concerned, I know that there is an American culture and identity which is not merely the sum of the various state cultures.  For example, Thanksgiving is celebrated nationally; American football is a nationwide obsession; every part of the country honors certain political ideals; free speech and free exercise of religion are valued everywhere; firearm ownership and activities are considered a basic right in every community; the list goes on and on.  The same TV shows are watched.  People have similar attitudes toward family.  Certain social customs are held in common.  There's the ""American dream"" ideal.  And on and on.

I believe Germany is similar in this respect because people everywhere, including on this subreddit and in der Spiegel, talk about Germans as though they have a certain national character and culture, and so many things about it (workaholics, austere, humorless) are quite Protestant.",0,1340858581,null,0,1340863004,0,c56mtqi,t3_vlm3j,t1_c56mtqi,t1_c565ni8,null,1429248149,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1
