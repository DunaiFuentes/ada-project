1.) Teaching in german schools is out of the question I'm afraid, but there are other things to do. I'd especially recommend tutoring, there are big organisations here (in my state ""Schülerhilfe"" and ""Studienkreis"", they pay very well for people with bachelor degrees and you'll teach groups from 1-6 students.). Then also there's always private schools which don't require any degrees.

Also, check for ""Volkshochschule"", which is a general night school for adults, they also accept teachers without master degrees! 

2.) I don't have any experience with TEFL courses, all I can say is that I don't think it's required oftentimes, at least I've never heard it. Double check that though, wouldn't want anyone to get in trouble just because I don't know. :) 

3.) No idea about pay, I'm afraid. Going back to what I recommended, tutoring would pay about 15-20 Euros an hour, and 30-40 hours a week shouldnt be a problem in a major city. 

4.) No way, I have never heard of that and would be shocked. ;) 

5.) All I can say about this one is that the larger companies tend to go into English more. Companies like Microsoft are so large and hire so many international staff that they even have german people working there solely to help people get accustomed in Germany (Don't know about Microsoft, but about smaller companies even). So as lond as he finds a larger company, he shouldn't be too forced into German.

Well this depends - I wouldn't say a trained craftsman is easier to exchange than, say, a generic project manager.  Your example welder has a specific skillset that is easily portable to another welding job.  I think the lack of mobility is more historic than anything else.

The project manager, on the other hand, relies more on (a) his knowledge of the particular environment he's working in and (b) whether he's smart and adaptable.  Those are not skills so much as human qualities - yes, a good one is probably more mobile than the welder, but a not-so-good one is also more replaceable than the welder.

&gt; Now, I wonder if programming (as in: producing and testing code) will become a blue collar job, with a more formalized industry.

This is a really good question and I'm going to venture that, rather than become ""blue collar"", it'll disappear altogether, to be replaced by automated code generation, much as the guy who riveted part A into part B in a car plant in the 1960s was replaced by a robot (without in any way denigrating the skill and education and training of good coders).  This, I think, is much the same as the kind of routine manual system administration work I started out with becoming increasingly automated; I've had to change my focus away from the purely technical bits to stay competitive - and although jobs in that field indubitably still exist, they've become far less hands-on and much more commoditized, with generally lower pay than when I started in the 1990s.

What will definitely stay around, and become increasingly critical, is the ""meta-stuff"" - basically someone to actually design system and program architectures.  But that will remain solidly white-collar work, and arguably become even more so as the guys who, for lack of a better way of putting it, feed high-level instructions to the machines, have to understand both business requirements and technical capabilities rather than being able to design, write, and test a particular piece of code for a specific function.  Coding jobs will definitely stay around for a very long time, much as programming work for languages previously thought obsolete have often kept cropping up again for the support of legacy systems, but they'll be far less prominent.

So speaking as someone solidly in that ""meta"" field (I do security risk analysis in my current job, something that may at some point become automated, but which at present requires human subjective intelligence, I don't think unions are feasible or desirable - and I don't honestly know how to ensure that workplace standards laws retain a good balance between flexibility for both employee and employer and protecting the interests of both.  My idealistic hope is that people in my position and education will have the wherewithal to be able to negotiate their best interests.

For a start, no, this is not true.  NAFTA is a larger economy than the EU if we're considering groupings of countries.

Secondly, this kind of puts the lie to your earlier claim that the US is in terminal decline, seeing as they go from economic strength to strength and a single country is competing with the EU (a collection of countries) as the world's largest economy.  Whereas Europe has been thrashing around for the past few years trying to sort out the mess they spent themselves into, the Americans got their head down, got on with the job of recovering and are ... starting to recover.

true,mysticgreen,GERM,Germany,"The perspective on Germany presented in this article is mostly right. The problem of parallel communities, which are basically segregated, was caused by government policies in the 70ies and 80ies. Initially, the so  called ""guest workers"" should return to their homes after a certain time. After the oil crisis in the 70ies, the guest worker program was stopped, and the workers should be sent home. This did not work of course. Instead, there was an influx of Turkish immigrants under family unification, which was out of control, because it was overlooked by the authorities. In the 80ies, a big wave of asylum seekers from Iraq, Lebanon and Turkey came. The government still persued the policy of sending the people back, as they were never intended to stay and become German. So, there was no need for them to seek integration, and german language skills were not promoted. Instead, there were so called ""Turkish Classes"" to culturally prepare Turkish kids for their return. Furthermore, the Turkish state, with its own interests in the background, was allowed to run mosques. And there are definately prejudices among the ""native"" population (even though I need to stress that this is probably found in every place in the world). And there is also a bad influence of the welfare state, that allows people to disconnect from society.

This is one side of the problem.

The other side is a cultural problem imho. A lot of immigrants come from rural areas, and they are unwilling to modernize their traditional views. This is understandable especially for the people who were minorities in their former ""homecountries"" aswell, like Kurds, Yezides or Oriental Christians. There is a lot of social pressure inside the communities to stick together. To obey the family rules, not to assimilate. In some places with a lot of immigrants, you nowadays find anti-German and anti-western ""racism"". And if you look at the crime statistics, especially in cities like Berlin, a cultural influence is undeniable.

Other minorities in Germany, like the Spanish, Greek, Vietnamese, made this transition already, and are better integrated and seek higher education more often than the Germans themselves. 

A lot of people in Germany see these problems, maybe some of you remember the debate about the book written by Thilo Sarrazin. However, the problems are only addressed by right wing politicians, in the way right wing politicians usually address issues. The left wing still clings to a concept of multiculturalism, where basically any criticism is a taboo, and a dangerous cultural relativism is present. Add to the mix the religious interest groups, which will call everyone who dares to address problems a fascist and nazi, especially people from their own community, who have come ""westernized"".

There are a lot of examples where good sides of multicultural society can be seen. But it works only with people who are individuals, who dare to step out their group, who do not need nationality or religion for their identity and who are curious to experience new things.

What does not work anymore is cultural relativism. Living together can only work on the basis of common values. Since this is a western country, these values are equality, liberalism and individualism, and cannot be negociated. The influence of religion is generally in decline. Therefore, the ""native"" majority does not want a rising influence of Islam. Everyone who appreciates this should be welcome to enjoy the privileges of this model. But the one who does not has to go. The states have to become more strict on that issue.",0,1338893250,null,0,false,0,c4wi4p1,t3_uktpa,t1_c4wi4p1,t3_uktpa,null,1429072276,13,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,13

I think maybe it's because the political, social, and economic integration of the EU is something that has very pragmatic results (whether for the better or for the worse). Our ideas may be influenced by some nostalgic feeling we have towards our country, but at the end of the day we are coming together for the common good. And if we do not support the EU for pragmatic reasons, then it is based on ideals of how cooperative our continent should become. All of these things are pretty obviously important. They matter for real.

Football on the other hand? Shit like Eurovision? There's no *point* to supporting a certain team except to find some arbitrary way we can get really fucking excited to watch people play a sport for hours. (Unless you're really into the intricacy of the sport, but then you support the most skilled teams and players). So I think we'll probably just hold on to our nationalism when it comes to sports and the like. It just makes it more fun, really.

One last thought - football doesn't really have anything to do with countries. Look at how many racist people suddenly stop caring that half their team's players are second- or even first-generation immigrants. Look at how many English people support Arsenal despite the fact that most of their players and their coach is French.

His father's ancestry is claimed by multiple people, not just Hungarians and Romanians, Serbs also claim him and a Tatar-Cuman origin is not ruled out either.

The weirdest story is that  Tatar-Cuman family first became a Romanian noble (Wallachian Knyaz, knight), then they got the name ""Serb"" but got Hungarian-Catholic in culture, Serb sired three sons, Mogos (Hungarian for ""tall""), Radol, which is clearly a Romanian name, and Vojk, which can be either Romanian or ancient pagan Hungarian. Vojk sired John Hunyadi. 

This is a huge mess for any amibitous nationalist legend-maker, and what it demonstrates is that the modern attitudes to ethnicity did not work the same way and did not count much back then.

BTW our (Hungarian) history books leave out entirely how Romanians even got into Transsylvania. A popular historical novel (Four Winds in Transsylvania, László Passuth) puts Romanian immigration in the era of Turkish occupation of Wallachia, basically people fleeing from Turkish cruelty. Another interesting factoid is that Székelys are often not considered ethnically Hungarians, merely sharing the language, but actually they are the descendants of Avars Hungarians found around Vienna, and resettled them as border guards into the Carpathian mountains. Given that Avars were more or less demonstrably Hunnish of origin, Székelys often considered themselves the descendants of Attila. (Prince Csaba mentioned in the Székely Anthem.)

- there will be a run on the banks, so the Greek banking system will probably fail;                    
- imports will be very expensive, and at the moment Greece imports far more than it exports, so any Greek company dealing with imports of any kind will probably go bankrupt;                 
- petroleum prices will skyrocket (again, Greece imports most of it's petroleum), which will also hinder any kind of economic activity;

But while there surely was Romanian immigration into Transylvania, there was also a Romanian presence earlier. But this is somewhat beside the point.

&gt;Székelys often considered themselves the descendants of Attila

I know. I have Szekely grandparents, and my grandpa often says this.

&gt;Given that Avars were more or less demonstrably Hunnish of origin

Afaik, this is false. The Avars, who came 3 centuries after the Huns, were a Turkic tribe, while the Huns were either Turkic or Mongol in origin.  They might have both been Turkic, but I have yet to read a confirmation that one is descended from the other. There were many Turkic peoples who came from the Pontic Steppe, including the proto-Bulgars, the Cumans, the Pechenegs, but I think that viewing them as branches of the same tree is more correct, rather than descendants from each other.

&gt;they are the descendants of Avars Hungarians found around Vienna

Don't you mean Hungarianized Avars? Although early Hungarians borrowed a lot (culturally) from the nomad Turkic peoples of the Pontic steppe, I would not consider them related to the Turkic people, given that they speak an Uralic language (whose conection to the Altaic alanguages is questionable, iirc).

Anyway, the ideea that the Szekelys are descended from Avar remnants is plausible, imo. Another plausible idea is that they are simply Hungarians, but because of the different socio-political organisation during the Middle Ages (as frontiersmen), they acqired a strong colective identity as different from the rest of the Hungarian-speakers in (Greater) Hungary. Just like the Moți (Moccok) from the Apuseni mountains have a strong cultural identity, as a bit different from the rest of the Romanians (as blonde blue-eyed mountain-people).

Hardly the same thing is it?

There are plenty of definitions which are useful:

&gt;Multiculturalism relates to communities containing multiple cultures

&gt;The characteristics of a society, city etc. which has many different ethnic or national cultures mingling freely; political or social policies which support or encourage such coexistence.

The only reasonably reply to that charge is: ""lol"".

Your analysis of my post is wrong here. I agree immigrants should abide by the law as should people born in this country. I see no controversy here, there is no pro-FGM/pro-honour killing group among pro- multiculturalists so I don't know why you're bringing it up. I don't treat either of these any different to any other crime, we have punishments and we should seek to prevent these from being carried out in the future.

Yes they are, they're completely different. You invented some other random stuff about non-overlapping and separate whereas Schwartz's definition refers to diversity of arts, languages, traditions etc. existing in one society. According to this definition Britain has always been multicultural.

Le problème des 35 heures n'est pas que les français travaillent moins en moyenne (ce qui constitue objectivement une certaine qualité de vie qu'il est difficile de négliger), mais le problème est que les 35 heures sont **imposées** à des professions pour lesquelles cela constitue une catastrophe!

Pour les ouvriers, et les autres métiers difficiles les 35 heures sont tout-à-fait normales, et l'on pourrait même justifier les 32 heures que certains sont prêt à proposer. Sans oublier qu'il est très facile dans ces professions de répartir le travail répétitif, et ne demandant que peu de formations, d'où une diminution du chômage dans ces professions :)
Mais pour les professions médicales, pour les maçons et ouvriers du bâtiments, pour tous ces autres métiers où la formation est longues ou le travail difficile à trouver (problème constant du bâtiment) ou la rentabilité déjà difficile...

Et non, cette moyenne ne signifie RIEN, il nous faut la répartition par profession. Qu'est ce qui nous dit que les allemand n'ont pas plus d'ouvriers (qui ont moins tendance à faire des heures sup grâce à une répartion plus facile du travail) que les français?

Par contre, si la question est ""est-ce que les 35 heures ont provoqué un désavantage productif global sur nos voisins européens ?"", c'est une autre histoire.

L'article décompose cette question en deux parties:

* Du fait des 35 heures, est-ce que les français travaillent globalement moins que les autres européens (en particulier l'Allemagne) ?

La réponse est manifestement non, le français moyen travaille 38h par semaine (malgré les 35h), et 1554 heures par an ; l'allemand moyen travaille 35,7 heures par semaine, et 1419 heures par an.

Si la durée *effective* de travail hebdomadaire est à 38h au lieu des 35h de la durée *légale*, c'est bien qu'il existe la possibilité d'adapter la durée de travail en fonction du métier : certains français travaillent 40,45h par semaine, d'autres 25 ou 20, puisque la moyenne inclut les temps partiels par exemple. Donc les 35heures ne sont pas appliquées brutalement à tous, les professions qui en ont besoin peuvent déjà adapter leur durée de travail. L'Allemagne typiquement a comblé une partie de son chomage avec des contrats en temps partiels, mais les chiffres tiennent compte de cela.

* Est-ce que les français produisent peu par rapport au temps travaillé ? (comme vous dîtes ce n'est pas parce qu'on travaille *longtemps* qu'on produit *beaucoup*)

La réponse est manifestement qu'une heure de travail français produit plus de PIB qu'une heure de travail allemand.


Quant à la décomposition des moyennes présentées dans l'article en sous catégories professionnelles ou par secteur : j'ai du mal à voir ce que ça apporterait. Bien sûr ça permettrait de mieux comprendre les causes de notre avantage productif, mais ça ne changerait pas les conclusions globales. Ca vous permettrait de comparer par profession, de dire par exemple les ingénieurs allemands travaillent mieux ou plus que les ingénieurs français, et vice versa en ce qui concerne les ouvriers, mais pas les médecins, etc etc. OK, ça permettrait de cibler localement des pistes d'amélioration. Mais le fait est que globalement, en considérant toutes les professions et l'ensemble du PIB, ça ne remettrait pas en cause les conclusions de l'article.

Not necessarily, as there's a lot of Greek government spending which doesn't boost the economy or helps society in a significant way, as the gains aren't superior to the deadweight loss. The austerity measures taking place in Greece are fundamental, for too long the country has been amassing debts without any possibility of paying them back, now that's really taking a toll the only long term solution is cutting back on the spending, not outspend your way out of a spending crisis.

Sure, if it's money being used for worthwhile investments or causes, it would be foolish to not use it, otherwise, if it's more money poorly spent, what Greece needs to do is not waste it, and that's what's behind the austerity measures, only spend the money you really need to.

&gt;With every passing year of stringent austerity, the Greek economy contracts and the Greek government has to make more cuts due to the decreased state revenues (due to the contracting economy).

Up until 2007 Greece had positive real GDP growth and its debt to GDP ratio was also increasing and over the 100%, so even when the Greek economy was growing, their debts were increasing more than their growing revenues.

Now that their economy is contracting (no wonder, with the amount of bad investments they had - sure, their government was spending a lot but that public expenditure was never expected to have significant returns and now their GDP shrinks accordingly) and considering the debt they already hold, that's their only viable solution, to struggle through the austerity measures and not to accumulate further debts which will not help them at all in the long run.",0,1338912221,null,0,false,0,c4wl14e,t3_uly9p,t1_c4wl14e,t1_c4wk89k,null,1429073717,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

That's not what a straw man argument is, but nevertheless, since it is a particularly prominent belief held by neo-nazis, it's not unreasonable to make that connection. Just like it wouldn't be unreasonable to assume that you were a socialist if you were advocating for the rights of workers.

&gt; Or are you going to imply that all of Hungary is neonazi?

Well, judging from their recent political developments, it wouldn't even be such a crazy suggestion.

&gt; A culture is never static, you are correct. But that does mean that culture does not exist and does not have elements that can and should be preserved. Thus ethnocultural preservation means retaining things like language, unique arts (music/literature/theatre/movies/etc.), architecture, and even social values, cuisine, etc. Change happens but it is slow enough that some things can be identified that are cultural markers. For instance Bach would be a cultural marker of Germany and has been for centuries.

And I'm playing Bach for my piano exam tomorrow, as a matter of fact. Does that make me any less Danish? Of course it doesn't.

You can't have it both ways — either you allow culture to change naturally, or you don't.

All that is true, but there have been pan-[ethnicity] movements in almost every nation in Europe beginning in the mid-19th century. The multi-cultural kingdoms and empires were severely threatened and succumbed to nationalist tendencies. Look at Austria-Hungary for a great example for an empire crumbling in part due to nationalist tendencies of the citizens, or Germany for an example of dozens of small kingdoms ceasing to exist in a drive for unification *of the German peoples*. 

Switzerland is almost an exception, although the population there is somewhat segregated (which is admittedly anecdotal and based on a second-hand account of a relative who lives there). Belgium has had and has problems between ethnicities. I have no idea how Finland fares with regards to their ""Swedes"" and indigenous people, and you probably know more about Romania than I ever could.

Still, as others already said, it's generally considered cheating. When ... ""probing for avaibility"", it's not uncommon to get a completely unrelated ""my boyfriend blah blah blah"" as a ""no, thanks"" indicator into the conversation. At least, I've always taken it as ""no"". 

For the guys, some ""if she doesn't know, she doesn't care, it's better for us"" self-cheat might be at work.

For your ""douchebag attractor"", something more subtle in might be at work, like a difference in flirt behavior.


&gt; Example from a long long time ago:   
Some guy evaluated the encounters of US soldiers stationed in UK during WW2 with local girls. 

&gt; It turned out that the English girls considered the US guys ""very agressive"", while the US guys considered the English girls ""easy to get"".  Weird - but it made sense when they were asked to rank typical ""steps"", e.g. for US, kissing came very early during flirting, for England, rather late. 


I'm not saying that it's the same for you, it's been many years and a few sexual revolutions since then, and the world ha grown smaller.

If you're thinking about archaeologically interesting places i recommend our impressing gothic dome and the old city walls, that show how important Magdeburg has been as a fortress in the prussian empire. 

We also have four different museums, where the technical museum is pretty most interesting IMHO www.magdeburgermuseen.de/

If you like architecture you should also check out the university campus and the ""Hundertwasserhaus"" as well as whole Otto-von-Guericke Street. And don't forget to take a nice walk along the ""Elberadweg"" through the whole city.

Local hot spots for partying are the legendary Hasselbachplatz and the bars around the most beautiful district ""Stadtfeld-Ost"".

Another place futher away from Magdeburg is the ""Arche Nebra"" www.himmelsscheibe-erleben.de/ - absolutely worth a visit.

So um. Valenciennes. The first thing to do is probably going to the ""office du tourisme"" (pretty much everything can be found on google maps). They'll give you fliers and much better advice than mine.

There are many historical monuments to visit: the library, a few churches, the city hall's pediment (the thing on the front) is said to be famous. Pretty much all of that is concentrated in the center of the town, near the ""Place d'Armes"" (the main square of the town). It has a few horribly expensive bars where you can drink and perhaps eat are there too, many shops. There is also a museum, unfortunately you just missed the night of the museum when it was free and open until midnight.

If you want to have fun, there's a bowling (the satellium, they also have a nice restaurant where everything is made of potatoes, called the Pataterie), a movie theater and an ice skating ring very close together, if you want to get there take the tramway (main means of transportation) and stop at ""Vosges"" (there is also *another* bowling near that, but it's farther). There are many bars scattered throughout the town, one of them is a pool bar (avenue de Denain). As for night clubs, I don't really know, being the stereotypical SAP (I know that the ""Black diamond"" is supposed to be good). There's also a somewhat big swimming pool.

Whatever you do, you **must** eat some ""Langue Lucullus"". It's made of slices of ""foie gras"" and ox tongue. It doesn't sound good, but it really is. A little bit expensive for the ""traditional"" sort, but you can probably get some for a low price (at Auchan, the biggest shopping center near Vals, accessible through the tramway too; another shopping center is located at Place d'Armes, a little smaller with different shops). There are other local specialties (most notably the ""Carpeaux"", some sort of cake made from chestnuts, it's not bad, and the traditional ""moules-frites"": mussel + crisps), but really try Lucullus at least once. There are a few good restaurants, but I don't know if that's what you're looking for.

That's about it for Valenciennes itself. There are many cities agglomerated with Valenciennes, with a casino in Saint-Amand (not very far, but you need a car).

In America, patriotism is very much connected with politics - after 9/11 a nation fervent with patriotism looked to their president and blindly followed him into war on the assumption that they would get those responsible and ensure America's safety and freedom. 

Here in the UK, patriotism is more connected to the royal family; I can't think of anyone who would like our Prime Minister (or almost any of our Prime Ministers of the past 50 years) to be representative of our nation, and as such our politicians are subject to a lot more scrutiny. Even if we had an elected head of state with no political power, like Italy for example, not only would it divide the nation a lot more than our current system, but I imagine it would render the head of state a lot more impotent than our royal family currently is.

Sure. A job in a university or public school is pretty much off the table at starters, but with your education, some language skills and persistence, it could happen.

But baby steps. Get that online certification, come to germany, get some private classes, get hooked up with a language school and youll be on your way.

I dont know the labor market in your husbands field. But there are tons of jobs for well qualified english speakers in the IT field and Germany has just changed the laws making it easier to hire foreigners for those positions. And if he gets a permanent visa, you will too.

Its just gonna take work and determination.

 British audience, probably written by an intern, but obviously if there's significant readership in Bosnia it gets read as a sort of quasi-diplomatic note. And the Telegraph clearly hasn't adjusted yet to that new situation.

I think, also, it is a pity. In Britain, you see, everyone is a comedian, and news and comedic tone are often quite closely intertwined, with a knowing glint in the eye and inflection of voice. Of course in general most of it is so mediocre that it scarcely qualifies as comedy, but rather gentle sarcasm and a gentle absurdity. But that tone is really one of the most characteristic British traits, which is pleasant in and of itself, as a kind of throwaway social cypher, and also quite useful, because it means you can make political statements without necessarily causing offense, leaving the door open to interpreting what you say as a joke or a semi joke. This is useful in everyday life, and on serious news (Newsnight and the Today Show on Radio 4) half news (Private Eye) and out and out satire (HIGNFY). But of course that flexibility is open for abuse, Top Gear and the tabloids being cases in point.

To claim that, you'd need to calculate social spending as a percentage of tax revenues. I unfortunately don't have the time to do that, but if you do it please let me know of the results; I'd be extremely interested to see them. My gut feeling is that Greece would be pretty average even by that measure, but I'm obviously biased.

&gt; Then if everyone pay taxes Greece wouldn't be in this position it finds itself in. 

It's easy to say that but increasing tax collection is pretty difficult. For example, independent contractors tell you ""want to pay 100 euros or do you want me to add 23 euros VAT?"". Few people will resist that offer and it's extremely difficult for the state to catch those kinds of deals. Second, there's a huge amount of small businesses in Greece. It's easy to check big businesses because there's so few of them but if an economy is almost completely comprised of small businesses, it's difficult to keep tabs on all of them. What do you propose to do about that? There's no obvious solution. Third, there's a lot of tax cheating by the rich. They buy off politicians to undertax them or to let them go if they are caught avoiding taxes. They feel no remorse for it so no amount of societal pressure will make them change their ways; blame the capitalist system and the ragged individualist ethos that comes with it. 

So, yes, if everyone paid their taxes fair and square, the revenue would skyrocket but it's not just a problem you can easily change or blame on the common man.

A good start would be to grant the right of independence to regions that weren't caused to demand it through an invasion. In those cases, they are just a backdoor annexation of land.

Like for example.. Scotland is interested in maybe seceeding from the UK.. they will do so by referendum.. Canada didn't take Scotland over with their military to make this happen. So you ask 'What does Canada have to do with this?' --&gt; Exactly.

So how can you trust a referendum if a military force occupies land and imports their own people to vote in the referendum ? How about we find a way to stop countries from invading each other instead of finding ways to make it worth invading for a quick legal landgrab? :)


Also, another angle would be that if we made it too simple to just start your own country because you're a corrupt mayor and you wanna be a corrupt president (this is bound to happen if it was way too easy, people get stupid when they are given the power to become more powerful)... then we'd end up with chaos in many countries just because a lot of regional leaders decide that they just wanna have their own country all of a sudden and do whatever they want.. do you think it would be wise to find a way to make it easy for these power-hungry people to create their own country through populism? Fuck Austerity.. lets create a new country called Utopia with our own currency that we print every day.. I'll make all of you millionaires.. lets just seceed from France first :P

Or... another angle.. lets say.. take an area like Bradford in the UK... lets allow another few hundred thousand Pakistanis to go there, and then they can just become independent and eventually join Pakistan as a province or something.. obviously they are the majority and they can demand to seceed the UK.. why not? :)

False. A strong currency is great for countries which import more than they export, this way the essential goods we import aren't too expensive, we can more easily invest and take loans in the outside and foreign countries have to pay us more to invest here (and they still do such, so our surplus is greater).

As I mentioned before, most of out imports are not produced internally just because they can't. Euro, escudo or any other currency, we can't produce oil. Also, it's not viable and sustainable even to be self-sufficient in every aspect, this is basic, Adam Smith and David Ricardo level.

Sure, there's more to it, like for example, Portugal's traditional dish, [codfish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacalhau) isn't even found on Portuguese waters, but regardless, a strong currency is very helpful in this situation.

For example, the turkish cypriot minority on the island isn't much bigger than the british citizens on the island. Sure, they kept a little bit of land to use as an aircraft carrier in the region, but that was part of the deal they made to grant the island its indepedence. Here's a mindfuck for everyone: Cyprus borders the United Kingdom (check on the very southern part of it on Google maps :P), and the United Kingdom uses the euro currency in their Cypriot territory :P

So then some people say that turkish cypriots cannot reunify under the south because they are different culturally or whatever... dudes.. we have Syrians, Lebanese, Israelis, Polish, British, Romanians, Germans, French, Finnish, Swedes, Norwegians, Danish, Americans etc etc etc all living just fine in Cyprus.. I assure you turkish cypriots will be able to co-exist as well. If they can't.. I guess it'd be quite a screwup to add Turkey to the EU, now won't it ? Oh that's right.. they have to have special treatment based on culture/religion or whatever? Oh.. and now I'm the racist? :)

The solution is very simple.. Turkey takes their soldiers and demographic imports out, and the EU supervises the return of the northern occupied territories to the EU-recognized government... They haven't been killing other types of immigrants from what I see.. I don't think the turkish cypriots (who want to reunify with the south anyway) are gonna have any problem fitting in.. things have changed big time...

It's becoming more and more common to use English rather than Greek in Cyprus recently (since there are so many people from so many different countries here)... In fact a greek from Greece visited and wrote an angry letter to a newspaper about how there isn't enough greek around.

P.S. I'm a British citizen living in Cyprus. I have never been treated as a foreigner. The turkish cypriots will have more rights than me (like the ability to vote etc).",0,1338934123,null,0,1338935961,0,c4wqhsy,t3_ulxik,t1_c4wqhsy,t1_c4wq4ey,null,1435711031,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

&gt; The thing most people don't realize is that the money the government spends on pensions (and any form of government aid and benefits) ends up back into the economy pretty fast. It's a form of indirect government sponsored investment. Think about what a pensioner will spend their money on.

I don't really follow this. Economically, the money is the same as any other which is going to be spent on retail goods. Long term investment is something like spending £5bn now to build a bridge will will yield £10bn in real terms over 25 years, not using that £5bn to give to people to buy things in shops. Giving people that money is a form of immediate stimulus (because, as you say, it will probably be spent pretty quickly). But this is a dangerous argument to make, because although you increase stimulus in times of recession, you decrease it when the economy is prosperous. And stimulus spending which doesn't go away when the economy recovers, is of questionable economic value. This is actually a pretty good economic argument for unemployment benefits, because they automatically increase when the country goes into recession, but not for pensions, because old people tend not to vary with the economic cycle(!) The only way to do it would be to vary pension payouts over a ten to fifteen year period, which is clearly nonsense.

It is true that the basic idea of pensions is that the contributions made now should be invested for return in 20, 30 or 40 years, which justifies the multiplier between contribution and pension. But that relies on the contributions actually being invested, rather than being handed out to the population to ensure re-election, which is what happens more than it should. IMO public pension contributions should be put in a national infrastructure bank, which will give assured long term public/communal/taxation returns, for building things like bridges, motorways, railways, airports, high speed internet, and so on. And perhaps, on top of infrastructure, education, and things like scientific research, business seed capital, and so on.

Also, I should point out that the arguments for these benefits are not purely or even primarily economic. Even without economic benefit, they would be justified by moral arguments.

I think you have to be a bit careful separating out the different periphery countries here.

The problem in those cases was cheap capital flowing into the banks, and the banks (both core and periphery) making silly investments. It is only the need for those governments to prop up their banks which has put them in fiscal danger.

&gt; What I find hard to believe is how can any government spend so much even tough it will cause so much harm in the future?

Conditions change with time, requirements change with them, focuses change with governments, sometimes the economy is doing well and sometimes it isn't. Some measures are popular, others aren't. It's easy to implement the popular ones when times are good and governments can afford them, it's easy to prop up one sector when needed or another when it's desired, but it's very difficult to cut back. The popular measures get priority and are easier to find a majority for. People love getting privileges, and hate giving them up.

Times are good? It's only fair to share some of the wealth with those who have been left out. But when times get tougher, even more people rely on it, and cutting back affects those most who already have lost their jobs during the downturn. So when do you cut? When times are good and you don't have to? Or when times are bad and you'll only make matters worse for those carrying the heaviest burden?  

Or take demographic changes and their effect on the pension systems. Medical advancements mean that people live longer, and nowadays they have fewer kids. To overhaul a pension system is an enormous task, politically, and it will mean that either those who are too old to work get less than they were promised and had been expecting, or those who still work will have to work longer and pay more into the system than the generation they're now paying for.

It's not just social spending. Let's say you have a traditional industry, but slowly it becomes uncompetitive. This could be due to foreign competition, like with the textile industry in Asia, or due to technological change. Sometimes whole regions depend on a particular industry, e.g., on coal. So you give them subsidies or tax exemptions. Still cheaper than having hordes of workers lose their jobs and falling back on the social net. But now this industry is dependent on those measures, and by reverting them you kill it entirely. Same with new industries you want to develop if they fail to become a success.

&gt; Is the hunger for votes that much?

Sure, democracy plays an important role here. With proportional representation, governments usually are coalitions, and if you want your pet project to go through, you'll have to permit your coalition parters theirs. What's more, there's also an opposition. Governments avoid unpopular measures to stay in power, the opposition makes promises to get into it.  
In the documentary, (Merkel's predecessor) Schröder mentioned how the reforms of his government coalition have cost him his job. Those were the same labor market reforms and austerity programs Merkel is now pointing towards.

&gt; Why do banks finance some shady projects like housing, when there is no growing population?

Shady? It's a house, you can live in it. It has an inherent value. The monetary value is determined by the market. For something like a house, which presumably will be around for a long time, the markets should in theory take long term expectations into account. But markets fail sometimes.  

Imagine you're paying rent, and your neighbor bought his house after the euro made credit cheap. A few years later, his house is worth much more than when he bought it. He buys a second. Another year later, and prices went up again. Your rent has gone up, too. You feel you're missing out on something. So you buy one for yourself. Yet anther year later, and your house has become more valuable, too! This is too easy! Three years later, your house has appreciated in value enough for you to follow your realtor's advice to refinance and take the ""profit"" as a downpayment for a second one.  
Your banker is more than happy to help. The housing market seems pretty solid. His customers don't default on housing loans, if they get in trouble they always find a buyer right away. There's no sign of the market slowing down, and he'll be getting a nice bonus.  
Foreign investors have heard about the fabulous returns. A vacation home on the Spanish coast isn't a luxury anymore, but a sensible investment you can retire in one day. Look at those returns! 10% in a year, the sun is shining, and… oh, there's a financial crisis in the US? What if it will spread? Better get that money home where it's safe.  

Your colleague had been planning to buy a house as well after you told her how easy it was to make money in the housing market, but the banks have problems borrowing themselves these days and are reluctant to give her a loan. What's more, the housing market seems to be stagnating, and prices at the coast have even began to drop. She thinks it's better to hold off for a bit to see how things turn out. Another year later, and now prices go down in your area. Your colleague has decided to wait for the market to bottom out. Your neighbor has been trying to sell his third house at what appears to be the peak of the market, but it turns out to be difficult. You're getting worried as well. If you don't find somebody to rent your second house to within a month, you won't be able to make payments. The realtor tells you that with all those people in the construction sector losing their jobs, the odds are slim. You need to sell quickly. You tell your realtor that you'd be satisfied to sell it for what you had originally payed for it. He just shakes his head.

Second, he continued, giving up the Deutschemark and monetary sovereignty was the price for German reunification after the Cold War. Thus, he said, Germany’s historic responsibility must be above all to save the euro, as its creation marked the ultimate European reconciliation and end to World War Two.

Slight of hand, instead of having the bailout loans on the books of the sovereign they want to have it on the books for the banks so the sovereigns debt to GDP ratio is not affected

&gt;a more expansive European monetary policy

Already defacto happened with the 1 trillion 3yr LTROs from the ECB. This is just a band aid that buys time, nothing more, nothing less. 

&gt;or a Europe-wide guarantee for the threatened banking system.

same thing as the euro bonds idea

None of these so called solutions are any, they are all designed as a quick fix for the markets that will come home to roost somewhere down the line, to say nothing of the fact that Germany went through major structural reforms in the early 2000s when it became the ""sick man of europe"" in order to become competitive again. 

Never mind that Germany doesn't have the capacity to bail out the PIIGS as a whole anyway. This is a no win situation for Germany, it's about choosing the lesser evil which unfortunately may still end up in a collapse of the euro either way.

IEDs are the biggest killer ([source](http://afghanistan.blogs.cnn.com/2010/05/06/combating-the-no-1-killer-of-troops-in-afghanistan/)), and the number of accidents, suicides, FF incidents are not that significant. 

[Here is some data on US IED deaths](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/25/AR2011012507204.html), and here's a well-cited excerpt from the [Wikipedia article on Coalition Casualties in Afghanistan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_casualties_in_Afghanistan):

&gt;In 2009, there were 7,228 improvised explosive device (IED) attacks in Afghanistan, a 120% increase over 2008, and a record for the war.[5][6] Of the 512 foreign soldiers killed in 2009, 448 were killed in action. 280 of those were killed by IEDs.[7] In 2010, IED attacks in Afghanistan wounded 3,366 U.S. soldiers, which is nearly 60% of the total IED-wounded since the start of the war.[8] Of the 711 foreign soldiers killed in 2010, 630 were killed in action. 368 of those were killed by IEDs, which is around 36% of the total IED-killed since the start of the war to date.[1] Insurgents planted 14,661 IEDs in 2010, a 62% increase over the previous year.[9]

My point was that the IEDs and guerilla tactics were devastating because they were strategically effective against NATO militaries trained for a different kind of war, not that they were devastating in terms of deaths caused. Of course the casualty rate would be much higher if NATO were engaging a military in combat 24/7, but these Afghans engage only when the opportunity arises, and when they do, they are devastating.

They had the foresight while the rest didn't.

&gt; Shady? It's a house, you can live in it. It has an inherent value. The monetary value is determined by the market. For something like a house, which presumably will be around for a long time, the markets should in theory take long term expectations into account. But markets fail sometimes.

I call it shady because the amount of houses built in Spain and Portugal surpasses the amount of people who are searching for housing, and the amount of people who can afford such housing. When the banks take that first step, and HOPE that later the markets will return that investment, what can you expect? That money will magically fill their coffers, just because they think their investment is sound?
If I'm not clear in what I'm trying to say, I'll sum it up: Banks are investing in projects that the population of a certain country doesn't need and did not ask for.

Firstly, it's ""Environment, crime and housing"", so not just environment. 

Secondly, I'd say housing is probably a big thing beacuse US houses are massive compared to the majority of EU homes. Since land is not as scarce they tend to spread out more. 

As roflburger points out the EPA is very strong and the ""bad"" reputation the US gets is mostly because of its refusal to sign up to climate change treaties as they ""favour"" developing countries e.g. China (among other things). 

Canada by contrast is exploiting its tar sands.

The entire public sector, and even private enterprises (not all, though) gradually tuned their resources and mode of operation to match this model, and it is now very hard to switch back to a competitive market mode.  For example, a lucrative importing business emerged (for cars and other consumer goods), which is where a significant part of the borrowed money was spent, and a lot of enterprises went into it.  It is worth noting that there are forces in Greece still actively fighting against these changes, in the vain hope that the former model can be restored.

Veggies at marche enfents rouge. Or at the primer over there. Quality is better then at rambuteau.

Ever tried mashed potatoes with dried apricots dates and parsley? Should go well with the freshness of the mint and the lambjus.

Je vais reéssayer.

  Le problème vient du fait de la législation des 35 heures. Quand je dis qu'elle est *imposée*, j'implique aussi aux employeurs. Même si les français travaillent plus, ça va coûter plus cher à l'entreprise et risque de nuire à la croissance. C'est un fait, les heures supplémentaires sont très cher payées. Les employeurs ont d'ailleurs parfois tendance à demander à leurs employés de ne pas faire d'heure sup.

Et la tu va me dire que cette article contrecart complétement cette arguement. Puisque moi je dis, les 35 heures poussent à moins travailler, et que l'article dis que les français ont, malgré les 35 heures, des heures de travails importantes et une bonne productivité.

D'où mon problème de catégorie professionnel! Comme l'autre a dit, les cadres travaillent souvent jusqu'à 45 heures par semaine. T'es d'accords qu'il font progresser la moyenne? On voit déjà que l'article ne permet pas de conclure quoique ce soit, si ça se trouve l'Allemagne à bien moins de cadres que la France. Mais je vais pas faire l'idiot, je sais bien que ce n'est pas le cas. A l'inverse les ouvriers, dont les heures sup sont moins courantes (dîtes moi si je me trompe) font retomber la moyenne autour des 35 heures. Si ça se trouve l'Allemagne a plus d'ouvrier que la France.

Et tu l'as dit toi même, le coup du temps partiel, ça pourrait peut-être juste dire que l'Allemagne fait beaucoup de temps partielle!

Donc cette article, je le redit n'est pas complet du tout: Il faudrait la valeur absolu du nombre d'ouvriers, de cadres et de temps partielles. Et la verra: est-ce que les cadres français travail plus que les cadres allemands? Est ce que les ouviers français travaille plus que les ouviers allemands, etc. Là, on comparera 2 choses comparables. Mais le problème de cet article c'est qu'on en peut pas interpréter ces données (d'où ma référence aux médicaments, un raisonnement pareil ça crée du mediator: ""oh! vous voyez bien! En moyenne les gens qui prennent ce médicament guérissent dans 50% des cas alors que quand ils prennent celui là ils guérissent que dans 35% des cas, c'est dont qu'il soigne mieux. -Oui sauf que dans ta première étude tu as choisis tes patients de tel sorte qu'ils soient dans des conditions idéals, et pas dans le 2e cas. En réalité, avec les bonnes études tu te serais rendu compte que ton premier médicament ne vaut pas mieux qu'un placebo).

Donc tout ça pour dire que je ne peux pas avancer mes arguments contre les 35 heures car cette article est trop biaisé et ne me fournit pas toutes les données.

1. Never use the term you to address another speaker when discussing things like nations, cultures races etc. it comes across as accusatory. It also puts the speaker in the awkward position of being grouped with all of the things you associate with whatever entity you are speaking of and feels compelled to defend themselves personally. It makes your argument at seem more as an attack than an objective observation. 

2. Personal insults are never productive in an argument. Early on you accuse me of being mad twice when I had given no indication of being so. You later told me that I was rude. And finally that I was a child. It is very hard to keep a conversation on topic and civil when you constantly call on your opposite to defend themselves personally as well as their opinion on the subject. 

Perhaps this will give you some insight as to why some arguments seem to lose focus and become unnecessarily bitter. ",0,1338987927,null,0,false,0,c4wzama,t3_unmgy,t1_c4wzama,t1_c4wyyjk,null,1429080570,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,WalkerEU,CYPR,Cyprus,"Yes. Greece would send huge shocks through the euro. If this wasn't the case, they would have found a way to let them default and quit the currency ages ago.

The euro was created knowing a similar situation to what we have today would eventually come up and that the only ideal solution would be for some kind of fiscal union, eventually leading to a federation.

Being fluent in the greek language myself and knowing a bit about how greek people think, I can see that probably they think it's a very good idea to stick it to the so-called ""Troika"", however as we all know.. the first country to be devastated by a giant ""OXI"" will be Cyprus.

I live in Cyprus and talk with many people around me about this scenario.. you are Cypriot yourself.. I think we can both understand that if Greece does this to 'stick it to the troika' and ends up screwing Cyprus over, there is no way that Cypriots will ever trust Greece with money ever again, and it will somehow damage relations between the two countries.

The other thing is, the EU was created on the trust that countries will keep their promises to eachother. Greece had trouble and needed a bailout. They had to make a few promises to receive it. Part of the bailouts was also forgiving government debt, which is what created the problem for Laiki bank now. In hindsight everyone knows that Cyprus shouldn't have accepted the debt haircut because of the exposure, but Christofias justified it by saying ""Can you imagine what would have happened if Cyprus said no?"". Even though he's not even close to being my favourite politician, I can see what he means. So imagine.. do you think any other country will want to work with Greece if they don't stick to their promises? Do you think that the Cypriots will have lots of love for Greece if they destroy a lot of our businesses overnight by leaving the euro?

Of course, right after that, countries such as Portugal and Spain will start being targetted much more aggressively. As we all know they're starting to talk about fiscal union and mutualizing debt etc. This will more than likely happen. The only thing that we are not certain about is if Greece will be part of it or if they will be made an example of to scare everyone else if they start trying to play hardball. We need to remember that Cyprus is a small economy, and while our private sector will be affected badly by Greece exiting, it's much easier/cheaper for our European partners to bail us out -- and Cyprus has a much better history of sticking to their commitments than Greece -- they even agreed to the debt hair cut which they knew would harm Cyprus just so they aren't seen as being idiots in the EU.

Ninja Edit: Out of all of the countries who could possibly want to leave the EU, Greece is the worst example.. they receive a huge amount of money just by being in the EU.. it's easily one of those countries that you can say directly benefits from being in the EU (the same applies to Spain). It's just madness to believe they will be able to effectively play chicken with the europeans.

tl;dr: The Europeans will work together to resolve this mess and they will succeed. But at these times of crisis we're starting to see who we can work with and who we can't.. it would be a shame for Greece to leave because they wanna 'stick it to the troika' right on the doorstep of fiscal/political union -- which was the goal from the very beginning of the euro.. a move which will almost instantly restore confidence to the currency.",0,1338988112,null,0,1338990287,0,c4wzbko,t3_ugvd0,t1_c4wzbko,t1_c4wyu3w,null,1429080581,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

&gt; But the likelihood is that the euro will survive because a breakup would be devastating not only for the periphery but also for Germany. It would leave Germany with large unenforceable claims against the periphery countries. The Bundesbank alone will have over a trillion euros of claims arising out of Target2 by the end of this year, in addition to all the intergovernmental obligations. And a return to the Deutschemark would likely price Germany out of its export markets – not to mention the political consequences. So Germany is likely to do what is necessary to preserve the euro – but nothing more. That would result in a eurozone dominated by Germany in which the divergence between the creditor and debtor countries would continue to widen and the periphery would turn into permanently depressed areas in need of constant transfer of payments. That would turn the European Union into something very different from what it was when it was a “fantastic object” that fired peoples imagination. It would be a German empire with the periphery as the hinterland.

&gt; I believe most of us would find that objectionable but I have a great deal of sympathy with Germany in its present predicament. The German public cannot understand why a policy of structural reforms and fiscal austerity that worked for Germany a decade ago will not work Europe today. Germany then could enjoy an export led recovery but the eurozone today is caught in a deflationary debt trap. The German public does not see any deflation at home; on the contrary, wages are rising and there are vacancies for skilled jobs which are eagerly snapped up by immigrants from other European countries. Reluctance to invest abroad and the influx of flight capital are fueling a real estate boom. Exports may be slowing but employment is still rising. In these circumstances it would require an extraordinary effort by the German government to convince the German public to embrace the extraordinary measures that would be necessary to reverse the current trend. And they have only a three months’ window in which to do it.

&gt; We need to do whatever we can to convince Germany to show leadership and preserve the European Union as the fantastic object that it used to be. The future of Europe depends on it.",0,1338993896,null,0,false,0,c4x0boy,t3_unyio,t1_c4x0boy,t3_unyio,null,1429081055,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

Depends on the relationship with the neighbouring country, logically. If you had moved pre-WWII from Germany to the Netherlands and still lived there during the war you'd get people concerned about 'true loyalties' just as much, if not more, than with truly foreign immigration.

&gt; The term ""Caucasian race"" was coined by the German philosopher Christoph Meiners in his The Outline of History of Mankind (1785).[4] In Meiners' unique racial classification, there were only two racial divisions (Racen): Caucasians (""white and beautiful"") and Mongolians (""brown and ugly""). These terms were used as a collective representative of what Meiners personally regarded as good looking and far less attractive, based solely on the appearance of the skin of the face, for example the Germans and the Tartars he considered Caucasian, and the best looking, while Jews, Slavs and Native Americans as Mongolian, and ugly in the face.[5]

&gt; ...

&gt; In his earlier racial typology, Meiners maintained that Caucasians had the ""whitest, most blooming and most delicate skin"".[11] Europeans with darker skin he considered to be ""dirty whites"", admixed with Mongolian. Such views were typical of pre-anthropological attempts at racial classification, where skin pigmentation was regarded as the main difference between races. Meiners's view was shared by the French naturalist Julien-Joseph Virey, who believed that the Caucasians were only the palest-skinned Europeans.[12]

It does not qualify as progress for Southern and Eastern Europeans to duck within this classification, as the basis for a new form of ethnic identity, to set themselves apart from people from North Africa or the Middle East. Some people have olive skin, some have pink skin, some have white, some black or brown, and all the mixtures in between, but these terms are purely descriptive, and of little relevance, rather than some sort of meaningful, fundamental human classification.",0,1339005032,null,0,false,0,c4x2z8i,t3_uo8fi,t1_c4x2z8i,t3_uo8fi,null,1429082310,15,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,15

Coming from Iceland and not being a part of the general populace that went utterly mad with spending but instead sat back, laughing at them, thinking ""They'll bite the bullet eventually when everything comes crashing down"": I can very much relate with Germany's situation.

They didn't wana hear about it after wich several Flemish politicians accused them of just wanting to keep their workless votingbase (wich is kinda big). The fact that Flanders transfers alot of federal money to Wallonia isn't an idea many Flemish like to think about.
But this was just a tiny bit of the many political problems. The split of BHV wich is an electoral and judicial arrondissement near Brussels caused tons of problems too.

-Language conflicts happen from time to time.

-One of the main reasons for us leaving the Netherlands was religion. (They being mostly protestant we being christian.) however nowadays most of Belgium is secular or atheist and we dont really care about that.

-The big winner of last elections was the NVA who are a bit separatistic. (a decent party and much better then Vlaams Belang who are a bit extreme)

-It has calmed down a bit but during that political crisis news agencies were having pols in Flanders and the Netherlands. They were positive.

-The conflicts will keep happening and imo it has to end someday.

true,SK2P1,EURO,Brussels City Gangster,"Ok so there is a lot to answer and i'd like to give a different point of view. 

* The historical perspective is not relevant, Brussels might have been dutch-speaking (and I wouldnt say Dutch but rather Brusseller and other flemish dialects) but so have tons of cities in the South, some extrem groups (TAK, Voorpost) call that the ""stolen territories"" and they want it back in Flanders. 

* French people are very likely to welcome Wallonia, some french politicians said so (Melenchon). 

* Saying that the South is dirtier? Should i even argue with that? (I mean that's just a stereotype and most countries will say the same, Milano cleaner than Napoli, etc.)

* I don't think that religion was the MAIN reason for the Belgian uprising. Amongst other things I think that the population in large cities was fed up with heavy taxes and no real power in governance. It was mostly a ""bourgeois"" revolution which occurs after a not-so-good Opera

* Concerning the split of Belgium: I do think it's a plausible outcome but I do not wish that.

* I'd say that the main problem between the two communities is communication (like in a marriage): there is less and less interest in the population to get to know their fellow belgian citizens. The main problem is the language: most flemish people do speak french (but the number is decreasing) the opposite is not true. In my mind English might be a good solution to have a ""neutral language"". Moreover Wallonia has an history of heavy-industry while Flanders relied  more on textile and services: which might explains why Walloons tends to vote for the left and Flemish the right (or center-right).

* It is true that Wallonia is poorer than Flanders, but that wasn't always the case, it might still change with time (some people talk about the ""wallonization"" of Flanders). However It is not certain that Flanders will be economically viable by its own, the same for Wallonia and Brussels. Nevertheless they would certainly do better than the South, but Wallonia might enjoy ""structural funds"" from the EU.

* Concerning the election: the N-VA is a separatistic party, no doubt about that: they are calling for a strong Flanders in a strong Europe and did not join the government coalition. But this kind of party has always existed in Belgium: i think of the Volskunie which was created to gather flemish claims and dissapear after the reform of the State. (And I think that the big winner of the election was rather the PS, party of the prime minister)

* What bugs me are the different decisions taken by Flanders, such as the non-nomination of democratically elected mayor, the wooncode which only allow dutch-speaking people to live in their territories, the abandonment of the language census as an objective base for the language border and the strict refusal to allow Wallonia and Brussels to have a territorial-link. But I do understand their claim for more autonomy. I don't talk about Brussels in a split-scenario, there is too much to say.

So IF Belgium splits Walloon won't try to be on it's own and will just join France? (It's again just a personal opinion question).

What about the ""deutsche Gemeinschaft"". Walloon, France or Germany?

&gt; I'd say that the main problem between the two communities is communication 

Why isn't Belgium ""forcing"" all of their languages on their kids? For example a educational-language switch at a certain age like Luxembourg does. (for example 6-12 all classes in your mother tongue, 12-16 switching to the other language).

&gt; the wooncode which only allow dutch-speaking people to live in their territories

Just heard of this the first time. But a quick Google search told me that it only concerns social flats and that a ""commitment"" to learn the language is enough. Doesn't sound that far fetched, because I think that everybody should speak or learn the language of the country in which he lives permanently, it's for their own good. Of course while preserving their own language!

&gt; he refusal to allow a territorial-likn between Wallonia and Brussel,

Honest question, why would Walloon need it? It's not like Berlin in the DDR, I hope that even after a split Walloon and Flanders remain ""friendly"" to each other.

""The choices facing the Greeks are difficult and painful. But it is of historical importance, not only for the future of Greece, but also throughout Europe and around the world,"" says Noam Chomsky on the extremely important message sent by the ""Dawn"" for the elections of June 17.

In his message, a leading American thinker has sharp criticism for European leaders to implement austerity policies, which ""would undermine the social contract that was captured after many years of popular struggle."" He points out that Greece was the ""main victim"" of such ""barbaric programs"" and further found that ""at the forefront of evolving movements across Europe."" Finally, looks forward to the Greek election of June 17, noting the historical weight of the ""whole world"".

Specifically message to Noam Chomsky, professor of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), says:

""Since the financial crash of 2008 so far, EU leaders insist on austerity policies, torpedoing thus the prospect of a recovery and punishing their populations. Existing policies will undermine the social contract that was captured after many years of popular struggle . This conclusion, moreover, as admit at times and off-can is the dominant motive for the whole project.

Greece was the main victim of these destructive and in many respects barbarous programs. At the same time, is at the forefront of evolving movements across Europe, who question the programs and seek to overthrow them. The options facing the Greeks are difficult and painful. But it is of historical importance, not only for the future of Greece, but throughout Europe and around the world. ""

&gt;So IF Belgium splits Walloon won't try to be on it's own and will just join France? (It's again just a personal opinion question).
What about the ""deutsche Gemeinschaft"". Walloon, France or Germany?

IMO if this happen it will depend on Brussels and the status the city will get. We already have the Wallonia-Brussels Federation so it is institutionalized. But I don't think that Walloons will jump on the opportunity to join France: even if we are culturally close because of the language there is still what we may call a (french-speaking) belgian identity. About the German-speaking community the question is quite complex and I have no shame to tell that I have no freaking idea what they would want to join. It is such a small minority that they practically have no political weight at the national level.
&gt;Why isn't Belgium ""forcing"" all of their languages on their kids? For example a educational-language switch at a certain age like Luxembourg does. (for example 6-12 all classes in your mother tongue, 12-16 switching to the other language).

There have been some stuff done to facilitate learning of the language (""immersion"" etc). But belgian educationnal system is quite complicated (first a disctinction between - ""free"" and ""official"" schools in other words religious/governmental school, the second one between federal, community, regional, provincial, local schools). Nevertheless all belgian students would have learned the other language for at least 2 years. Most of the youngster would rather learn English though.

* Concerning the wooncode; like you say ""everybody should speak the language of the country"" but Belgium has three official language. What's behind this is the political idea to maintain a strong ""flemish"" identity in their territory. I think (that's a personnal opinion) Flemish people are really more attached to the territories: even though the majority of the population in Brussels periphery speaks French, they still consider that it is a flemish territory and that everything must be done in dutch. The wooncode was quite borderline when it comes to discrimination. [here](http://www.eurotopics.net/en/home/presseschau/archiv/results/archiv_article/ARTICLE25433-Linguistic-discrimination-in-Belgium). Moreover we have a ""linguistic border"" which is not accurate because it was based on a language census that is now forbidden (because it would disadvantage the flemish region).

&gt;Honest question, why would Walloon need it? It's not like Berlin in the DDR, I hope that even after a split Walloon and Flanders remain ""friendly"" to each other.

That's an excellent question and a very political one. Regarding the split-scenario: the question of the territorial link with Brussels is essential. Wallonia withouth this connection could not claim Brussels because it is totally included in the Flemish area. Their claims might be more legitimate if they have a ""corridor"" linking the two territories. For instance the capital of the Flemish region is Brussels, for Wallonia it's Namur.

&gt;&gt;I don't talk about Brussels in a split-scenario, there is too much to say.

&gt;Please do, I'm curious.

Haha ok but quickly. First you have to understand our federal system. Belgium has a federal government and it's then divided in three.
Three ""community"" this division was mainly based on the language and thus their competences will be more ""cultural"" or ""educationnal""

* the french-speaking community

* the dutch-speaking community

* the german-speaking community

Each of them have their government, parliaments, etc..
Then there is another division based on the territory and that overlap with the first one. This a more ""traditionnal"" division for Federal systems:

* The Walloon region

* The Flemish region

* The Brussels-capital region

Each of them have also their government and parliament.
Then it becomes even more complicated: the two parliament and government on the Flemish side were merged into one (former Vlaamsraad). And a special status was granted to Brussels because of its binlingual character.
To put it simply if Belgium split: Brusselers will have the choise to join Flanders, or Wallonia, or to be independent. Even if the most ""logical"" choice would be to join with Wallonia (because of the language and cultural link) that might not be the one they will chose, for practical reasons, indeed they will benefit more to join Flanders (for social welfare for instance, or heath insurance, etc.)",0,1339015367,null,0,false,0,c4x5ndk,t3_unpnf,t1_c4x5ndk,t1_c4x4d2u,null,1429083566,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

I've got news for you. Those new parties that are all the rage nowadays (SYRIZA, ANEKSARTHTOI ELLHNES) are partly made up of ex-members of PASOK/ND.

Kammenos was in government from 2004 to 2009, Katseli was minister from 2009 to 2011; PASOK is no longer the party of trade unionists, they're backing SYRIZA now. Hell, Syriza even employs associates of disgraced former defense minister Tsoxatzopoulos. These new parties everyone is so eager to defend are effectively just a re-branding and recycling of political figures of the establishment.

As for the ones that didn't come from PASOK/ND, the signs are disheartening to say the least. On the right you've got - among others - the doctor who sued the Papandreou Government for high treason, washed out journalists and actors. On the left you've got the standard variety of uninformed party members rhetorically asking where's the harm in making our transactions in drachmas instead of euros, or promising a fresh influx of workers into the public sector. Good luck with that.

""During the period of the Roman Empire, historical sources show that there were many movements of people around Europe, both within and outside the Empire. Historic sources sometimes cite instances of genocide incited by the Romans upon rebellious provincial tribes. If this did in fact occur, it would have been limited given that modern populations show considerable genetic continuity in their respective regions. The process of 'romanization' appears to have been accomplished by the colonization of provinces by a few Latin speaking administrators, military personnel and private citizens (merchants, traders) who emanated from the Empire's various regions (and not merely the Italian peninsula). They served as a nucleus for the acculturation of local notables.[95] Given their small numbers and varied origins, Romanization does not appear to have left distinct genetic signatures in Europe. Indeed, Romance-speaking populations in the Balkans have been found to genetically resemble neighbouring Greek and Slavic-speaking peoples rather than modern Italians.[96][97]""",0,1339020582,null,0,false,0,c4x6y08,t3_unpnf,t1_c4x6y08,t1_c4x26u3,null,1429084240,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Der Prinz und die Drachen 
Erzähler: Da waren einmal ein König und eine Königin in einem Land weit, weit weg. Sie hatten einen Sohn, der freundlich und großzügig war. Als er zehn Jahre alt war, war sein größter Wunsch, ein Haustier zu haben. 

Prinz: Mutti, Vati, ich möchte ein Haustier zum spielen. Darf ich einen Hund haben? 

Königin: Nein, Hunde sind zu schmutzig und hässlich. Du darfst keinen Hund haben. 

Prinz: Darf ich eine Katze haben? Sie sind sehr schön und spielerisch. Ich mag mit Garn und Katzen spielen. (Korrekt, wirkt aber komisch. Wie wärs mit: Ich möchte die Katze ein Wollknäuel jagen lassen.)

König: Nein. Katzen machen mich niesen. Ich bin allergisch gegen sie. Aber, sie sind sehr spassig. (besser: lustig / unterhaltsam)

Erzähler: Der Prinz weinte und bettelte nach einem Haustier, bis seine Eltern nachgaben. Sie hatten Mitleid mit ihm und beschlossen, ihm ein Haustier zu seinem elften Geburtstag zu schenken. 

König: Wenn wir unserem Sohn keine Katze und keinen Hund geben können, was dann? Einen Goldfisch? 

Königin: Keinen Fisch! Fische sind langweilig! Was hältst du von einer Eidechse? 

König: Ja, eine Eidechse ist perfekt! Wir kaufen unserem Sohn ein Eidechsenei, damit er es wachsen sehen kann. 

Königin: Ja! Das ist eine gute Idee! 

Erzähler: Dann gingen sie zum Markt und kauften ein Eidechsenei von dem Tierpfleger. Sie wußten nicht, dass das Ei verwunschen war. Am nächsten Morgen war der Geburstag des Prinzen und seine Eltern gaben ihm das Geschenk. 

Prinz: Es ist mein Geburtstag und ihr gebt mir ein Ei? 

König: Es ist kein normales Ei, das ist eine Eidechsenei. Schlaf mit dem Ei unter deinem Kopfkissen, und es schlüpft. 

Nar: Am nächste Morgen wachte der Prinz neben einem Babydrachen auf! Es war keine Eidechse, es war ein Drachen! 

Prinz: Meine Eidechse ist ein Drachen! Ein Drachenmädchen! Ich liebe sie! Ich will sie Simone heißen. 

Königin: Ich denke, ist das ein guter Name für ein Drachenmädchen.

Nar: Der Prinz und Simone spielten überall zusammen, und er liebte sie sehr. All die Liebe ließ den Drachen sehr, sehr groß wachsen. Spät in einer Nacht, hörte der Prinz eine schöne Stimme. 

Simone: Mein lieber Prinz ich habe mich in dich verliebt. Wir haben so viel Spaß zusammen. Ich will mit dir für immer zusammensein! 

Prinz: Wer bist du? Wo bist du? 

Simone: ich bin es, Simone, dein Drachen! 

Prinz: Du kannst sprechen?! 

Simone: Ich will deine Prinzessin sein! 

Prinz: Ich liebe dich, aber bist du ein Drache! 

Simone: Ich kenne eine Fee, die uns helfen kann! 

Erzähler: Am Morgen gingen sie durch den Wald und zwischen den Bäumen. Sie wanderten bis sie zu dem Haus der Fee kamen. 

Simone: Gute Fee! Ich bin Prinzessin Simone Königreich des Nordens. Ich wurde verflucht ein Drachen sein, aber bin ich ein richtiges Mädchen! 

Gute Fee: Ja, ja! Dies passiert die ganze Zeit. Und du willst zurück zu einem echten Mädchen verwandelt werden? 

Simone: Oh, ja! Bitte, bitte! Der Prinz und ich lieben einander für immer. Ich wünsche ihn zu heiraten und das kann ich nicht als ein Drache. 

Gute Fee: Wenn sie wirklich einander lieben, dann bricht ein romantischer Kuss im Licht des Mondes den schrecklichen Bann. 

Nar: Der Prinz und der Drache flogen zurück zum Schloss und planten für ihre Hochzeit um Mitternacht. Alle Stadtleute waren zur Hochzeit eingeladen, um der wahren Liebe ersten Kuss zu sehen. 

Prinz: Ich habe Angst! Was ist, wenn das nicht funktioniert? Wir werden wie Idioten aussehen und meine Eltern werden mich töten! 

Simone: Was auch immer! Oder liebst du mich nicht genug? 

Prinz: So ein Unsinn! Ich werde dich lieben, ob du eine Frau oder ein Drache bist. Niemand spielt mit mir wie du! 

Nar: Alle kamen in dieser Nacht zusammen und die Hochzeit war wunderschön. Dann kam die Zeit für ihren ersten Kuss um die Ehe zu besiegeln. Und dann küssten sie sich! Es war zauberhaft und der ganze Himmel mit Mondlicht erfüllt. Simone war auf magische Weise in eine wunderschön Prinzessin verwandelt. Der Prinz und die Prinzessin Simone feierten mit den Leuten des Dorfes und wenn sie nicht gestorben sind, so leben sie noch Heute.

Turkey can't invent provocation to attack? That's news to me... As for the combination of leaving NATO and scaling down defence looks like a recipe for disaster. Cyprus tried it in 1974 and the result was the Turks invading the Northern part of the island which they still occupy until now.

true,TheMentoMan,null,null,"I am Greek and you are probably already aware of all of my country's problems. My mother came to Germany because she never liked living in Greece and she wanted to get away from her family. She came to Munich when she was 21 to study medicine and she liked it so much that she stayed. She didn't apply for citizenship sooner because back then double citizenships were illegal and she didn't want to loose her Greek citizenship. Double citizenships were made legal quite a while ago but by then there was no need for a German one because Greece was accepted into the EU. So it really doesn't matter that much which citizenship you have if you are an EU citizen living in the EU. But because of Greece's situation it makes a lot of sense to become German now. 

It's not that difficult to become a German citizen I believe. My mother had to apply at some ministry and she had to take the Deutschtest. She was very proud to score a 100% but then again I don't think the test is particularly difficult. You can look up most of the questions online, they are to make sure that you understand the basics of German government and geography. It's mostly some paperwork now, nothing too dramatic. On one of the forms she can apply for any of her children to become German citizens as well, even if they are over 18. So I basically don't have to do anything I think. I'll probably have to sign something eventually but because I did my Abitur here I don't have to do the Deutschtest. My mum started the process last year in September I think and I think we should have our citizenships sometime over the summer this year. But I'm not too sure, I wasn't really involved in the whole process. I will be really weird to be a 'proper' German. I love Munich and I think it's the best city in the world. And though I think of myself as Bavarian I never identified as German. So I'm glad I can keep my Greek citizenship.

Don't worry about getting around, most people speak at least some English if you're sticking to the more touristy areas. Just remember to learn a few simple words (merci, bonjour, etc) as it will greatly lubricate your social interactions. 

You may want to consider finding a guided tour as that will take care of transportation and itinerary.  In any case, make sure to pick up a guidebook as that will include details on lots of places to go and they frequently include a phrase book which will help you out of a jam if you need to interact with someone who doesn't speak English.

true,tabarnak_de_crisse,null,null,"You're probably going to be terribly disappointed. It is practically impossible to find your way around Paris and even more so outside of paris without at least some grasp of french. There are no street signs unless its major thoroughfares.

Maps do have street names, but omit the streets that honestly shouldn't be for the familiar. You can honestly end up wandering for hours and constantly ""miss"" the street you were trying to find.

Most Parisians are incredibly indifferent to people who cannot speak any french bordering on rude. Expect to be brushed off, sometimes apologetically, but frequently by the average citizen.

Most of the sights have ridiculous line ups, be prepared to wait two or three hours just to go up the Eiffel tower on a slow day. September is oddly enough one of the busiest times of the year.

The only people who will regularly speak to you, and in english, are the bosnian refugees who will hassle you for money, and pick your pockets. They look like gypsys and are very easy to recognise, they are all around the various train stations and larger metro stations. They will swarm you.

The Louvre puts most of their most precious objects in pay-extra areas, so you will be paying $45 euro just to get in the museum and an extra $15 just to see the Mona Lisa.

The metropolitan subway system looks nice above ground, but most of the trains are from the 40s and have doors that can easily snap your arm off. Tunnels can easily smash your head open if you're not being careful. A large percentage of the stations are old cement, smell of feces and suffer from the occasional cave-in due to the soft sand soil most of paris sits on. If you watch the news probably once a month you hear of someone getting injured SOME HOW in the metro. although death is actually very rare.

Most of the battlefields of WWI/II are now covered in private farms, no memorials, no plaques, so you won't even be able to see much. The only exception is in Normandy where there is a smallish monument that is easy to miss and very underwhelming.

Trains are prohibitively expensive, and are usually sold out days in advance. Be prepared to drop 50 euro just to get out of the city.

Once outside, the rural population will be incredibly suspicious of you, even more so the less ""white"" or more ""touristy"" you look.

Depending on how you present yourself, you can be spit on, like, phlegm thick spit.

However, most of this changes if you can speak french. Tourist-only fees disappear, the mood is friendly and amiable, but the more you mess up the more insulted they will be. You can expect people to abandon you mid sentence as you try to ask for help.

Don't carry a knife or the metropolitan police who carry assault rifles everywhere will scare the living daylights out of you. Don't so much as look at them or you will find yourself on the ground in about the time it takes for you to look away if you aren't careful.

Not to mention that certain parts of the city are dangerous from the minorities that seem to riot about every other week.

Basically, the tourist areas are made secure by these military like police but they are the most ungenuine areas of paris.

The countryside is mostly decrepit except for the older chateaus and what not that are national treasures.

Don't expect to find anything about napoleon, the new socialist president has been actively removing all references to napoleon and is even preparing to change the historic napoleonic code basis of their law system into something drafted by the eurozone.

Protip: Be EXTREMELY careful about checking visiting hours for everything-- museums, the american cemetery, louvre, mont st michel, versailles, etc. In France everything is open/closed on very random days and at very random hours. You will save yourself a massive amount of grief by doing your homework before you go, and checking to see that X will be open on the day you are there to see it, or that you will have enough time planned into your day to see Y. 

On that note, I was in Paris a couple months ago and the Eiffel Tower was only running one elevator because of technical problems, so the wait for tourists was predicted to be several hours long. Make sure you budget in time for things like that.

Never hesitate to ask people working at your hostels/hotels for recommendations about where to eat, what to see in the area. Usually (outside of Paris) they will be very glad to give you more information than you could ever need!

In Paris, everyone speaks English so it should be no problem. Outside of Paris you will find fewer people who speak English, but if you greet people politely in French they will do what they can to help you.

We get so much information about what's going on from both sides that it's just easier to become German now that it's so easy, than wait until it's too late. The British are already planning on introducing a visa for Greeks, so who knows how Greeks will soon be treated in Germany? As of now, it's very easy for us to apply for German citizenship and we're better safe than sorry. Besides, my mother says that she is already getting dirty looks from security at airports and she doesn't like being seen or treated as a second class person. We both must endure a lot of jokes which is really painful. Our people are suffering greatly, my family over there always worked hard and always had enough money, but now all their work is meaningless. All of my cousins have university diplomas but none of them can get a job. And my uncles and aunt are old and/or sick. What are they supposed to do? And all we hear are jokes about how stupid we are and how we all brought this on ourselves. It's very hurtful having to listen to that all the time. It's so easy to bash on people you've never met and to generalise a whole country. But it's difficult having to take that crap when your entire family is suffering. 

As for the traditional Bavarian stuff in Munich. Well, we are a big city so obviously not a lot of farmers in Lederhosen run around. But both Dirndl and Lederhosen have increased in popularity and everybody wears them nowadays to the Oktoberfest. The younger people living in the city are definitely not as traditional as the older crowd who live in the suburbs or in the countryside. But you get that everywhere. In every country the larger cities will have less tradition and more youth culture. But I think if you look for it you can definitely get the true Bavarian experience in Munich of you want to, or at least to some extent. I love Munich. It has all the benefits of a metropolitan city and yet it's small and compact and has loads of history. It's just so beautiful and Bavarians are so fun and easy going. Of course I don't want to stereotype, but so far almost all of the Prussians I've met were uptight and stuck up. Then again, those from Cologne and Berlin think that we are too uptight and that we have too much police on the streets.

Minimum wage reduces the number of employed people. In UK you will get full welfare from government while doing nothing.

In Zürich ist der Besuch der Volksschule obligatorisch. Die Volksschule ist in zwei  Abschnitte geteilt. Primärschule und Oberstufenschule. Die Primärschule dauert sechs Jahre und der Schüler hat einen Lehrer. Die Oberstufenschule dauert drei Jahre und der Lernstoff ist in drei Schwierigkeitsgrade geteilt. Nach der Volksschule kommt das Gymnasium, wobei der Schüler die Oberstufenschule überspringen kann. Dann dauert das Gymnasium sechseinhalb Jahre. Die verschiedenen Gymnasien unterrichten verschiedene Fächer. Anstatt ins Gymnasium zu gehen, kann der Schüler eine Berufslehre anfangen. Eine solche Berufsausbildung dauert zwei bis vier Jahre. Dabei übt der Schüler mit einen Beruf aus, geht jedoch einen oder zwei Tage pro Woche zur Schule. Nach dem Abschluss des Gymnasiums kann der Schüler eine Universität besuchen. Es gibt elf Universitäten in der Schweiz. Neun werden von den Kantonen betrieben, zwei von der Föderation. Um eine Universität besuchen zu können, muss der Schüler das Abschlusszeugnis des Gymnasiums haben. Nach der Berufslehre kann der Schüler immer noch eine akademische Karriere starten, indem er eine Fachhochschulen besucht. Hier bekommt er auch mehrere praktische Kenntnisse. Der Schüler kann auch zu einem Abendtechnikum gehen. Dann lernt er am Abend nach der Arbeit. Nach der Berufsschule kann der Schüler auch zu einer Maturitätsschule gehen, dann bekommt er ein Abschlusszeugnis und kann an einer Universität studieren. Und hier ist die norwegische Ausbildung:

Yeah Bavaria seems to be quite a great place. Although I think it's quite unnerving that the stereotype of Germany is full of old Bavarian traditions with all the Dirndls, Lederhosen and Brezln. Because in my region there's of course nobody who has ever worn that stuff.

I once talked with some American whose ancestors are from germany and they go regulary to some ""German Fest"" that takes place every year. And of course it was just some poor mans Oktoberfest with some guys who danced the Schuplattler although the region where they celebrated their german roots was populated with people from northern Germany.

That's not true. The only thing some empirical studies find is a very slight increase in youth unemployment.

&gt; Both gurantee same level of welfare, while one keeps you out of work, and the other provides at least some work.

Both keep about the same amount of people in work but the german model costs much more and increases inequality and redistribution of wealth from the poor to the rich.

&gt; So you don't want to pay 400 for underemployed, but will play 800 to unemployed?

I want people to get fair wages. It's not that I don't want to pay 400 for underemployed, it's that I don't want there to be people that get payed so little that they can't live from it.

&gt; What are you proposing?

Fair wages and reduced working hours. With increased productivity much more can be produced in one working hour than years before, so we don't need to work so much anymore. Reduce working hours, then more people can be employed and unemployment reduces. That's what happened in the past, increased productivity lead to reduced working hours as long as we had unions that fought for it. But strong unions don't exist right now, that's the problem.

&gt; Introduce the minimum wage so that all underemployed become unemployed?

That's not what would happen. Far from it. See above.

&gt; All countries with german system have lower unemployment than nations with a minimum wage.

Well, nobody can predict the future. But if we look at our history, what I described is exactly what happened in the past and can be expected to continue in the future.

And the fact that we have generally no problem keeping everybody alive and providing some basic kind of comfort while having high unemployment rate means that we obviously don't need all of our people to work 'full-time' to produce the things we need, so the logically consequence is to reduce working hours.

Yeah it seems to be very important in German society to speak German. If you don't speak German quite adequate as a foreigner or with foreign roots a lot of people don't think you are well integrated let alone a ""proper"" German. I think I read some article about a study that said that 94% of all Germans think that it's integral in order to be German to speak German. That's quite remarkable if you think about all the regional dialects. If you were to talk to me in Bayrisch I wouldn't understand  a lot more than if somebody talked to me in Dutch. Where I study now there are a lot of Saarländer and if they talk to each other all I can think of is ""Huh!?!""

That's very true. I even notice myself thinking that whenever I speak to someone who has an accent or uses incorrect Grammar. I instantly think that they aren't as competent or professional when people can't speak German properly. I do pronounce a lot of things Bavarian though and there is one thing that I know is wrong but I can't help myself, and that's wegen + Dativ. In Hochdeutsch it's wegen + Genitiv (ex: wegen des Wetters) but in Bavarian it's wegen dem Wetter, or wegam Wetter. That's the only thing I do which I know isn't proper German but everybody here says it wrong too so as long as I stay here in Munich nobody will correct me ;) It does get a bit frustrating with all the dialects though. Everybody just teases each other for not speaking correctly which is just petty and immature in my opinion. I worked with some Northern Germans and they kept teasing my for pronouncing Wurst 'Wurscht'. In my own city I was being teased for that. That was really stupid, honestly who cares? I think it's cool if you speak a dialect, it has way more character. The only thing I can't stand is saying Kloß instead of Knödel and Brezel instead of Brezn. Oh, and the worst thing you can ever do when you are in Bavaria, is pronounce Maß the way you want to. I know you want to pronounce it with a long a, because according to our spelling that's how you should do it. But, it's actually a short vowel, so you pronounce it as if it were spelled Mass. I guarantee you, if you ever mispronounce that word Bavarians will harm you. Just a fair warning! ;)",0,1339041968,null,0,false,0,c4xbkar,t3_unsc7,t1_c4xbkar,t1_c4xbapg,null,1429086416,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1
