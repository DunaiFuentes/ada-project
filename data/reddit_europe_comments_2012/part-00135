Je reviens au droit de la femme à disposer de son corps. Relation sexuelle n'implique pas directement grossesse, on est au 21ème siècle, je pense qu'une femme a le droit de coucher avec un homme sans avoir à prendre le risque d'être enceinte, et le cas échéant, à disposer de son corps si elle venait à tomber enceinte.

De plus, les conséquences ne sont pas les mêmes pour l'homme et la femme. Les femmes ne pourraient pas coucher avec des hommes sous prétexte qu'elles risquent de tomber enceinte, mais un homme aurait tout à fait le droit de coucher avec qui il désire, puisqu'il ne risque pas lui de tomber enceinte ?

De plus, on ne parle pas d'un enfant, ni d'une personne, mais d'un foetus (en l'occurence un foetus non désiré). Il n'a pas d'histoire, pas de passé, pas de famille, personne ne veut de lui. Pour moi il n'a pas de droits. Il en a tout cas moins qu'une femme enceinte qui est une personne avec une histoire, une famille, des choix, des aspirations, et un corps dont elle dispose.

Sure West Germany gives the East Billions but you can't create a sustainable and prosperous region on handouts. For other countries like the Czech Republic they only compete with West Germany on an international level not national. East Germans got stuck with West German wages with Eastern European productivity which meant that it wasn't worth it for many companies to invest there. The businesses that were there collapsed because the currency wasn't devalued to make them competitive. If they never united and East Germany had a devalued currency which made it's workforce cheap, the Billions the Germans invested in Eastern Europe would flow to East Germany. Allowing East Germany a good shot at rebuilding it's self but leaving the rest of Eastern Europe a lot poorer.

What do you mean by pro-cyclical? That an unregulated economy leads to cycles and therefore we should maximize government intervention to smooth them?

No, cycles are part of the system, they come and they go and you can very well regulate the market - without interfering with its proper functioning or without going out of the state boundaries - so that the downturns don't go this low.

For starters, don't allow banks and insurance companies to gamble with their customers money and well-define their boundaries. I'm not even going to comment on what started this back in '08 with US corporations like Goldman and AIG together with the rating agencies working together in betting against their own clients. In essence, never deepen the crisis with bailout

However, this is in no way an argument for these deformed Keynesian economics where governments use the crisis as an excuse to spend all they can and try to make things look not as bad as they actually are so they can keep in power at the expense of future generations which will pay dearly for the debt that is now being contracted.

&gt;What Greek private sector would have the money or be able to get lent the money to do this?

It doesn't have to be the Greeks to invest in Greece. If a Portuguese went there and built a F1 track and it proved successful, the Greeks themselves would also benefit a lot from it (more money in the economy, increased tourism revenues, higher employment, yada yada yada). You just need to create the proper conditions and the private sector (regardless of their country of origin) will surely get things going, provided that it's an worthwhile investment.

&gt;Additionally, as far as I know, they haven't, specifically in this project, outspent anything yet. 

Good, because they shouldn't. Even here in Portugal you see plenty of state-owned companies with chronic debt and privates who offer the same services in the green.

true,executivemonkey,UNSA,United States of America,"Yes, starting with Reagan, the Republicans did redefine the popular perception of the extent to which left-wing politics are acceptable, and did so to their advantage.

Still, if we are talking about the proper context, which is contemporary US politics, ""right wing"" refers to the Republicans and libertarians, with a few assorted fascists to whom no one pays attention added at the margins.

Also, the goals of the Democrats are in many ways quite left wing.  They want health care for all Americans.  They want to increase income equality, and they aim to achieve this re-distribution via gradated income taxation and government spending.  They oppose bigotry, including against homosexuals.

The methods they use to pursue these goals might differ from the methods of the European left, but the goals themselves are very similar, if not identical.  Also, almost nothing in the US can get done if the Republicans, or at least some of them, can't be included in the decision-making process.  That means that everything is a compromise.  So when Obama proposes something like mandatory health insurance instead of a single-payer system, that does not necessarily mean that mandatory insurance is what he thinks would be best in a perfect world.  In that case and in others, what is politically feasible is as important as what the politician thinks is best for the people or morally right.

Also, things like being permissive about guns and waging wars abroad are not inherently right or left.

Troika's main goal is to cut back on the public spending and to improve their interest rates so their state can more easily finance itself - meddling on their private market to make it more competitive is secondary.

Troika's measures aren't that relevant, specially when we're talking about a F1 track - it's not like Greece's high wages in the public sector will drive a F1 track away from there and into Shanghai.

But you're absolutely right, as of now, attracting foreign investment onto Greece will prove a challenge, it will certainly not be an easy task to reform to their economy and to make them more competitive (be it in this sector or in others).

However, this isn't an argument for in favour of the state (aka the taxpayers) to take the risk on their own and to invest on a F1 track (or in wherever) which, in the end, might never even prove a good investment. Here in Portugal we have plenty of examples of that - we built stadiums like crazy for Euro 2004 and now they're just sitting there draining money for maintenance while giving no real benefits back to society. They might be pretty and all but they're still wasteful spending of public money and they're still driving down the economy and making life much harder for us now. The Greeks are certainly better off without a F1 track than they would be if the state built one and it proved useless.

If they want competitiveness and to attract foreign investment, they'd be much better off with measures like simplifying their tax-code, reducing the tax rates for companies (be them F1 companies or of anything else), liberalising their labour market and reforming their justice system so that extra assurances are given to investors and Greece proves a much more desirable place to start a business in.

I am sorry, but it seems you need to do some more researches about our money system.
It is not about a ""fiat money system"" (I assume you mean that our money is not back upped by gold?) The problem is that it is a ""Schuldgeld System"" (debt money system?) 
It is quite simple:
Bank create/print money, and than they loan it to other people. 
They do not loan it for free, they want a interest rate for it. There is even a Zinseszins (a interest rate for your interest rate?). 
Do you realize what this means? 
They put 100€ into the economy and want 110€ back in some years.
Those 10 € they want does not exist, but where does those 10 bucks come from? 

From more loans

**It simply means that the debt is bigger than the amount of money in the world.**
This is a system failure, and we will need a redistribution of the wealth to fix it.
Those who have the claims need to accept a lose in their investments. 
The money they loaned does not exist
 
You use a German flag, so you could do a search on Youtube for ""Dirk Müller"". He tries to make the public aware of the debt money problem in a way people who don't know much about Economics can understand.

He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest — a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty. Nobody is able to achieve this completely, but the striving for such achievement is in itself a part of the liberation and a foundation for inner security.*

However, The New Quotable Einstein by Alice Calaprice (Princeton University Press, 2005: ISBN 0691120749), p. 206, has a different and presumably more accurate version of this letter, which she dates to February 12, 1950 and describes as ""a letter to a distraught father who had lost his young son and had asked Einstein for some comforting words"":

Religious teachings were forbidden in schools only to be replaced by propaganda of ""socialist morality"". Church youth groups were prohibited and replaced by organizations under governmental purview. A socialist name-giving ceremony took the place of the traditional christening of infants. The communist authorities introduced a ceremony called *Jugendweihe*, as an alternative to Christian Confirmation, in which youths pledged loyalty to the socialist ideas - without participation you lost any chance of higher education or a good job.

To prepare, we decided which areas we wanted to visit.  I had never been, but 2 of us had been several times as their family is Italian.  4 of us did most of the travelling together (my gf, her sister &amp; her bf) and we booked our flights &amp; hotels back in February.  We also booked our wine tour, gondola rides, etc in advance with our travel agent.
5 of us bought plane tickets at once, for about $950 each (including return flight). We relied a lot on tripadvisor.com reviews for the hotels, plus sometimes we shared rooms so we saved a lot of money that way.  Some nights netted out to about $50/person depending on where we stayed. Air conditioning is a must during the summer!
We rented a car for the entire trip, which was a bit pricey ($2000+ CAN for 2 weeks, included insurance &amp; international driver's license that I had to buy).  Having a car was great because we were on our own schedule.
A month before we left I began listening to ""In Flight Italian"" and grabbed a few books so I could be social while I was there.  This helped big time!  Especially if we were lost or traveled off the beaten path.  I highly suggest learning at least the basics of the language.
I packed incredibly light.  1 backpack for 2 weeks.  All of my clothing, including pants, jacket, hoodie etc was less than 1' high neatly folded.  Check out Rick Steve's ""Europe packing list"" [here](http://www.ricksteves.com/plan/tips/rick-steves-packing-checklist.pdf). Pack light. Trust me, you will feel so liberated.  Before you put it in your bag, ask yourself ""Can I justify carrying this across the globe?"".  Also pack things that have multiple uses.
Be sure to bring a comfy pair of running/walking shoes that are already broken in.  My Nike AirMax' shoe were perfect for this and my friends were super jealous.  If you are a relatively active guy like me &amp; plan to spend most of the day on your feet this is a MUST!
I left my phone at home and decided it was only going to be a distraction.  Sure, if there was an emergency I could have been royally screwed, but I took a chance.  I only packed 1 camera (GoPro, super small) with 10 memory cards (bought them REALLY cheap on amazon.ca) since I didn't have access to a dedicated computer or laptop.  I also took out roughly 600 euro in cash and upgraded my debit card to the Visa debit card which essentially works anywhere Visa is accepted internationally, just in case.  Glad I did this.
As far as food goes everything there is incredibly fresh.  In Italy I found they didn't use harsh chemicals and pesticides.  I am a huge food lover &amp; enjoy cooking quite a bit, but believe me, the best food you will ever eat will be in Italy.  Especially if you have friends or family there to visit and they make you a real home cooked meal.
Was hoping to leave the general tips to the end, but they are just scattered about above.
If you have any more specific questions i'd be happy to answer them.
I hope this helps.  Ciao!

It isn't clear from the article whether or not it's a maintenance issue or if it's a fault with the construction designs themselves. Regardless, when a state approves the construction of a nuclear powerplant, they HAVE to make experts regularly inspect it - both before, under and especially after construction - and be prepared to pay for any reparations. Nuclear power comes with a huge responsibility, because if it isn't handled correctly it can backfire on your populace; so it is like an unwritten contract between the people and the state, that if anything goes wrong it is because the state failed to live up to its responsibilities, despite being aware of the risks of not handling their nuclear power properly.

&gt;Oh, and that ""socialistic"" shit... you're American, right? 

Haha, no. I'm Danish.

&gt;:D yeah, sure...

Your snarky remark aside, why do you think governments are not investing 100% into renewables and *still* construct both coal (bad) and nuclear (good) powerplants? Sure, renewables would be much prefered to nuclear power if they provided the same energy security, effciency and production costs - but they don't. It isn't some conspiracy between the states and the fossil fuel companies. You have to be pragmatic and look at the best alternative until renewables have reached the stage where they can actually compete against other methods, and the absolute best alternative is nuclear power.",0,1349242442,null,0,false,0,c6gvtqp,t3_10uti7,t1_c6gvtqp,t1_c6gvihj,null,1430051136,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

Both. But that rector number 3 is still under construction and it is 5 years late. And they do make regular inspects: they have found over **15.000** faults or remarks on shitty piping, wrong materials, bad welding, cracking concrete... At the construction site they speak over 60 languages: it is made by the cheapest work power in Europe: Polish, Belorussians, Latvians, Estonians, French, Ukrainian etc. They have paid 2 € euros an hour for Polish cable-electricians...

&gt;why do you think governments are not investing 100% into renewables and still construct both coal (bad) and nuclear (good) powerplants?

Because of lobbers. And that you can't put your eggs in the same basket. During winter we may need 10 - 25 times more energy (or even more) if there is like minus 35 celsius for a week. Then we start up the reserve coal plants and other, like peat. btw coal (bad) and nuclear (even worse)...

&gt;and the absolute best alternative is nuclear power.

If that's true, why then a AAA country Germany and Japan are getting rid of it? And that US or others don't want Iran to have it? And why Denmark is putting huge amounts of money in wind power? Is it even the leading country on manufacturing wind turbines etc.? Are you trying to promote this ""utterly awesome and orgasticaly superior"" nuclear power just to get people's eyes of the avoidable next energy boom: wind?

Pour que je comprenne bien votre position : l'abstinence étant la seule contraception 100% efficace, une femme ne devrait avoir de relations sexuelles que si elle veut un enfant, puisqu'il y a toujours un risque ? On interdit de fait les relations sexuelles aux femmes dès lors qu'elles n'ont pas un but procréatif, alors que les hommes, eux, conservent leur droit au sexe récréatif puisqu'ils ne tomberont pas ""enceint"" ? Quand je parlais d'être au 21ème siècle, je pensais à ce genre d'idées que le féminisme s'évertue à combattre.

&gt;De plus, on ne parle pas d'un enfant, ni d'une personne, mais d'un foetus (en l'occurence un foetus non désiré). Il n'a pas d'histoire, pas de passé, pas de famille, personne ne veut de lui.

Ce qui pour moi définit une personne et par extension une personne avec des droits ne se résume pas au fait d'être vivant, ou composé de cellules vivantes. Un foetus reste de l'ordre de la potentialité, pas de l'existence en tant que personne : un foetus n'a pas eu de contact humain, n'a pas partagé la vie de quelqu'un, n'a pas vécu d'évènement en relation avec d'autres humains, des choses qui arrivent quelques secondes après la naissance seulement. De ce point de vue, un foetus n'est pas une personne, un foetus n'a vécu aucune expérience. Si on se place dans le contexte de la potentialité, alors on doit considérer que les  gamètes, en tant que futurs êtres vivants potentiels, ont eux aussi des droits.

But in a lot of other places there were all kinds of anti-fascist, anti-occupationist national resistance and liberation movements - Czech Air Force, Yugoslavian partisance, in WE the Resistance in France being the more typical examples. These resistance movements were of many kinds and colors, but they two typical ones were either Communist or nationalist, of a ""let's kick out the foreign invaders from the holy lands of the motherland"" type. Given that in these places the nationalists were generally seen being on the good side, the anti-fascist side, the side of the resistance, nationalism was not came to be seen as such a bad thing. Everybody would see a hugely nationalist Gaullist French resistance fighter as a good guy or at least being on the good side, same for Yugo partisans etc. So in the Eastern Block if and where nationalism had a sufficiently anti-fascist historical streak, like nationalist anti-fascist, anti-occupation resistance/partisan movements, then it was more tolerated, and then the national church and religiosity with it too.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Brilliant, let's invade the Czech republic. Are you going to compare the economy of Germany one year before the biggest war the world has seen, when they were building up to take over Europe, with the year 2012? I do not think that is a good comparison. Sure, we could spend 20 % of our GDP on military spendings, invade Turkey or Russia, and there will be less unemployment, but it will be a lot of destruction.And, ask the US, spending a lot of money on the military (which Germany definately did in 1938) isn't all that cracked up to be.

Look, let's drop the historical discussion about the Germany's pre war economy and just focus on what I wanted to point out; the policy of letting people and corporations work with belated payment. A Keynesian measure pur sang which had very positive effects in a Germany before it developed in a war economy based on looting and confiscations. The point is that they were able to invest more than they had, exactly what we could use right now.

&gt; The Eurozone, nor the EU has no right to tax individual countries, so yes, it goes against laws, and freedom. It is up to the individual nations to tax their citizens. If you are going to take away that freedom you have to renegotiate everything . Whether you want a federal Eurozone/EU or not, it will not happen easily, and certainly not in a few years. So no, it is not a solution.

The EU does not have the right to tax individual countries. However, it doesn't need to. The EU doesn't control the budget of individual countries but at the same time it obliges them to keep their debt in order and it proposes methods (austerity) to get to that point. The EU could commit countries to invest a high percentage of their GDP and propose methods like belated payment and the use of a part of saver's money. I'm not saying this is likely, but at the same time; the EU is a democracy and when the majority of countries elects anti austerity politicians it could tilt the balance.

And well, we don't even need the EU to do it. I just propose it because these measures are much more effective on an international scale.

&gt; ... before you were talking about that southern Europe needed to borrow and invest money, but you never mentioned who is going to lend them the money and how they are going to afford it. Could you please elaborate on that, since that was partly my original question? Where are they going to get the money from?

I never said they should lend money. To me lending is an option of last resort and I proposed 4 other possible methods to enable investing; belated payment, using saver's money, extra taxes and printing money. Extra taxes however means a strain on the economy, and the EU doesn't like it, printing money means inflation and the EU doesn't allow it.

But when countries are pushed this far; and the EU is not interested in changing course, these countries will take matter in their own hands and this might mean the end of the Eurozone, and maybe even of the EU.",0,1349252936,null,0,1349253124,0,c6gxaw4,t3_10pypc,t1_c6gxaw4,t1_c6gi2kf,null,1430051831,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,rmc,IREL,Ireland,"I can answer about Ireland. Ireland is probably in a unique case because for a long time Ireland was quite poor, and Ireland had lots of emmigration, not immigration. Just think of all the Irish-Americans in the USA. However from th mid 1990s to mid 2000s Ireland became wealthy and then people wanted to move *in*, which is better than the days when lots of people had to leave.

So there are some people with black skin in Ireland, but the vast majority of them would be actual recent migrants from African countries (the plurality of them are from Nigeria, so many Irish people think they are all Nigerians). There is a lot of undercurrent of verbal racism here against Africans. Lots of taxi drivers are very annoyed at africans. Many people think all Africans/Nigerians are scammers and crooks. It's terrible. ☹

Africans, though, are not a large percentage of the non-native (or ""non-national"") population. There are loads of people from UK (which has it's own set of historical baggage), and many many people from Eastern Europe (yay for expansion of the EU!). The attitude towards eastern europeans (and polish people who make up a large percentage of eastern europeans), would be mixed.

However in your case, people'll quickly figure out you're an American (y'know when you talk), and will probably but you in the ""American"" mental box, not ""African"" mental box.

Ireland does record nationality and ethnicity on Census forms (nationality figures from 2006 http://census.cso.ie/Census/TableViewer/tableView.aspx?ReportId=77138 ethnicity http://census.cso.ie/Census/TableViewer/tableView.aspx?ReportId=77140 Census 2011 figures are being prepared and aren't released yet).

A lot of the employment law is EU law, so it would be similar all across the EU, meaning UK, Ireland etc will have similar.

I suppose one difference between the USA is that you have ""white"" and then ""black"" (amoung others), whereas there are lots of things in EU that would count as racism but would be between 2 white people (to an American). Mostly cause Europe has split into various differnet countries with various different ethnic identities and there has been a history of not hiring people from Over There™.

Another Irish difference, is that Ireland has an ethnic minority called Travellers. They have various lifestyles that are similar to Roma people (such as living in caravans). There is a *lot* of racial tension between the settled community (which I am) and the traveller community. Many settled people would claim travellers aren't a race and it's not racist to discriminate based on them. (The law does explicity say discrimination based on traveller status is illegal, just like racism or sexism) A government minister got in trouble recently for writing a letter to a constituant reassuring them that a traveller family will not be getting a council house near them ( http://www.rte.ie/news/2012/0926/phil-hogan-traveller-family-house.html ). There is a lot of racism against travellers, but you are obviously not a traveller, so it won't apply to you.

There are a lot of similarities between Ireland &amp; USA w.r.t. to race relations, but it's probably more complex than ""white skin"" vs ""black skin""",0,1349256607,null,0,1349256909,0,c6gxmke,t3_10v7tn,t1_c6gxmke,t3_10v7tn,null,1430051989,16,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,16

The only time they can ask such questions is when enforcing affirmative action, and then they'll make it clear this is being done under the rules laid out by EHRC (plus they have to give details on how to contact EHRC if you have a complaint about the affirmative action).  Here's a full list of what EHRC [protects citizens against](http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/governmentcitizensandrights/yourrightsandresponsibilities/dg_10014458).  
The only thing they do ask routinely in job applications is whether you have the right to work in the UK and/or EU. That's a legal requirement the government insists agencies and employers perform.

As for official forms, they ask that mainly for census or passports. They shouldn't really ask for other reasons, but sometimes councils will ask to get their own census type information. But it's generally not to discriminate. There are plenty of laws in the UK to protect against official discrimination.

Now that's not to say there isn't discrimination in the UK. But it's more a case of racial abuse. But any friends or colleagues I have who have been subjected to such abuse have always said whilst that's not good, they still find it easier than mainland Europe. Unfortunately I'm a white European, so I can't comment on their accuracy, but they are friends, so I'll take them at their word on this.

This is not a case only for Greece though. Small and weak countries often fall pray to some higher power. And people in power usually want to stay in power so they take the ""bribe"" and do the bidding of the higher powers. Greece is being ruled by the same families of politicians who are in close ties with the same families of businessmen for decades now. 

This client - seller business between ruling parties and outside powers has been extended to the people too. The parties and the politicians used (and are still using) the same tactics to ensure the control of the electoral body. By ""bribing"" people with jobs, favours, a better position, they made sure that they would remain in power using the assets gained from their little-big deals with the outside powers. Everything in a way works like a Pyramid, where power and money are in play. 

But that would explain only how Greece got to the point of being on the verge of collapse. It's surely an important fact, but it's a historical fact only. 

What's going on around all of Europe right now is a strong attack from the corporations who see an open field of weak countries on the verge of collapse (the entire south and many of the eastern european countries) and they pray on the assets of those countries like vultures. Everyone got there for somewhat different reasons but as soon as they were there, the party started.

true,rmc,IREL,Ireland,"&gt; Very good synopsis. just want to say a personal thanks for referring to Travelers as an ethnic minority.

It's insane the amount of racism against travellers. When an Irish woman won gold at the olympics at the boxing, Irish people were up in arms when a newspaper made jokes about ""fighting irish"". When an Irish man won bronze in the olympics, Irish people made loads of jokes about travellers stealing the silver etc. Hypocritical double standards.


&gt; Regarding the eastern europeans that have moved to Ireland, there is a huge amount of inter-marriage between the Irish and Eastern Europeans (probably because lets face it they're much better looking than us). I don't expect that it will matter much with the next generation

Another factor with Eastern Europeans &amp; Irish is that many polish people are (a) catholic (b) white and (c) like to drink a lot. This is close to Irish people, so they fit in better, and can also convince Irish people that they aren't racist because they know &amp; like some polish people.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;The EU could commit countries to invest a high percentage of their GDP and propose methods like belated payment and the use of a part of saver's money.

No, they can not, without renegotiang the Maastrich treaty and the stability pact. Right now for example, countries (apart from Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Bulgaria, DK, England and possibly some country I've forgotten) have to submit their budget to the EU. If it doesn't live up to the expectations, the country could, in theory, be punished. But the countries *have to know what the expectations are*, and they are the stability pact. Nothing whatsoever about taxes I'm afraid. 

Also, the EU and the Eurozone can't really start punishing someone, since they have completely ignored all countries up until now. If they hadn't, they could start, but complaining that Poland have a 5 % deficit while Italy have a debt/GDP ratio of 120 %, is ludicrous. 

Also, using savers money means taking money from private banks, who might be doing just fine, have nothing to do with Greece whatsoever. I would think that goes against every capitalistic freedom ever, you can't just ""take"" money from companies, and it is certainly against the law in the Nordic countries, and I'd guess in a lot of other countries

Also, if our government said something along the lines ""Well, we are going to tax you 25 % more, on all your savings, since the Eurozone has fucked up once again"", I'd move all that money to a Norweigan/UK/Swiss bank, which is, perfectly legal. Sweden (and every other country in the world) would not let our banks experience a bank run/collapse of our banks just to hand over more money to southern Europe. 

So, even if the majority of the EU countries elect someone anti austerity, they can not force other countries to tax its citizens in the way you propose.And, if you think countries will do it voluntarily...I mean, Finland for example are complaining now. Their government would never ever let all their banks copllapse because Portugal need more money.....

&gt;belated payment, using saver's money, extra taxes and printing money.

Extra taxes in which countries? Northern Europe already have higher taxes than southern Europe, and are much, much better at paying them too. Southern Europe are, as far as I am aware, complaining about the tax burden as it is. Again, it would have to be done on a voluntarily basis, and frankly, that would not work. ""More taxes for me so that southern Europe can get more money""? I can just hear the complaints. Also, there is actually a limit to how ""high"" taxes can be. There is also a tax competitivness i the EU, and any individual country raising their taxes to fast, to high, will be in trouble I believe. 


Belated payments, that is default. Telling banks that you are not going to pay them now, but in ten years is a default in every sense of the world. Cancelling payments is defaulting. THe market don't belive in countries who says they are going to pay them ""later"". The market would be closed of to those countries. Frankly, no one believes in belated payments, no one will lend the country any money. If a country can't borrow money - default. 


Printing more money - well, I believe one can do that, and I do think that it should be done, to some extent. However, it is a fix that is a bit dangerous (there are risks involved), the Germans are dead set against it, and, it doesn't change the underlying issues one bit. It could, pehaps give the countries some small breathing space, and just for that it could be warranted, as long as it is done sensibly. 


I am sorry, I don't mean to shoot down all your suggestions, I am jut genuinly curious as to anti austerity people think that the money will come from.

Perhaps, if I have been complaining a whole post, I should come with some suggestions of my own. 

The problem is that I really do not have that many suggestions. While I do think above all reforms need to be made, and austerity to a certain point is warranted, one doesn't have to have a PhD in Economics to see that a) the south is suffering b) it is not really helping. 

I honestly think that the Euro is so wrongly contructed, that some countries will have to leave. Greece for example, perhaps Portugal and Spain. It will give shockwaves, and the countries will need aid, but trudging on isn't exactly working either. 

We live in interesting times indeed.

true,foul-mouthed-lawyer,FRAN,France,"The French cultural view is shaped by:

- Greek-Roman legal heritage: society is created by a willing agreement of responsible citizens to live together **under common rules**. Hence, if you follow the rules, you're a citizen, whatever the color of your skin.

- the universality of the ideals of the Enlightenment: they took political existence during the French Revolution (and in a weird way, also during the First Empire), and they are still today understood as having a universal potential. Colonial France had a severe case of **the white man's burden**; colonialism is dead, but the French still feel they have the duty of making the whole world as civilized as they think they are.

- a long aristocratic past: the early medieval feudal structure was replaced by strict birth-aristocracy from the 14th century onwards. Aristocracy is such an essential component of French society that the French Revolution just replaced birth-aristocracy with education-aristocracy. Racism exists in France, but is not an essential part of the culture: the French are mostly classists, not in the marxist meaning, but in terms of their own view of social classes, dictated by **how well you write French** and how much education you have.

A black man in France who:

- knows and follows the social rules, behaving in public according to the local understanding of what a gentleman is,
- speaks and writes grammatically correct French within an educated register,
- wears the French equivalent of what American call ""professional attire""
- displays a high level of education

will be considered to be a member of the upper class and afforded a high level of respect. **The color of his skin will be a very secondary consideration** compared to the preceding elements.

Of course, more leeway will be given to people identified as tourists, foreign visitors, and francophiles.

It's easy for a foreigner to become the most popular man in a French small town: just say that you're settling down in France because you love the way of life and the political ideals and demonstrate your understanding of those ideals. Your neighbors will not only fall in love with you, but also sing your praises to everyone in sight.

Second, the essence of social democracy is that there is enough wealth in a country, it is just distributed unequally, so let's distribute it equally. Same for regulation like worker rights, which is basically a redistribution of not wealth but power.

Now, I am not sure about Poland but for example in Hungary there is plain simply not enough money in the country. It is not that it is unequally distributed but not enough. For example I know at least 2 expensive restaurants which have next to zero guests, meaning the rich people somehow disappeared. 

So I think Eastern Europe must focus first on building wealth and worrying about distributing it later.

Another point. Some people (Keynesian economists) say social democracy can not only build wealth because it created demand which pulls investment.

The companies need money to work and they can't just rely on ""later"". 

Also, why on earth, should foreign companies agree to that? No one think they Greece is going to pay back their loans to banks, IMF etc, why on earth should they pay companies? Investmentwise, it would be stupid, and the CEO who agrees to that, is going to be kicked off the company.

Promise, like super duper promise. The government is really, really going to pay us this time around.""

-""Klick""

The problem is, no one trust southern European countries and their governments, nor can they function ""alone"", the world is to global for that. 

&gt;But I never talked about transfers, only about leaving the austerity paradigm and opting for massive investments in ones own country.

So, what you are proposing is extra taxes in southern Europe and using southern European savings to help investements in those countries. No money at all from the north.

The problems are several. Southern Europe has a less attractive business climate for a variety of reasons, so they need to have lower taxes for companies than northern Europe, to be competitive. 

Then I suppose you can tax private persons. Well, at first, southern Europeans aren't exactly known for their tax diligence, so it will have a much smaller effect than in northern Europe, since, let's be frank, they are much more tax evasion and corruption.  Second, a lot of people already have pretty small salaries, so there is not that much to take from. Also, since the unemployement is increasing all the time, there is even less people who are working, which one can tax.

Furthermore, using peoples saving or increasing tax on them is just as unlikely as in northern Europe. Spain, Greece and Portugal are already experiencing a small, slow bank run, and if their countries would come up with something like this, the bank run would be massive, and the banks would collapse. There is nothing stopping Spanish people from moving their assets into a UK/Finnish/Swedish bank - and trust me, that would happen. 

EU can't play a role in this since the northern countries would block it. Northern Europe (rightfully or wrongfully) are already pissed off as it is, and besides, a lot of countries in the EU are not even in the Eurozone. I can understand that, we voted no to the damn thing, why the EU we have to keep paying for what seems to be a fuck up on an international scale, to save a currency we do not believe in.

However, the threat of violence from skinheads who consider pride parades holidays to go beat some people up, and who will gladly travel across the country to do so, is very real.

Now, I don't know if the best way to deal with this is to not have the parade at all, but it's certainly one way. Another way is to increase the security, but that takes more resources and won't necessarily stop the determined skinheads. In fact, this could incite more deadly violence since security is generally armed. It's a pretty complicated issue, but I certainly do hope that /r/europe doesn't think we're anti-gay or anything. It's really a few bad apples that ruin it for the rest. Is there a better way to ensure that there is no violence?

Also, I haven't looked into it very much but apparently I've heard from a few friends and family that the parade features some pretty anti-christian things (besides them being gay -- I'm talking about making fun of Jesus or something, I don't know), and something like this certainly doesn't help the pride parade's case in a country that's predominantly Christian.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Yes, but the very reason we let our families get shitty is the state support. If the parents of those people you mention who shunned would have needed to think ""I really dislike this, but then I again I need my kids to support me when I am old... so let's try to swallow it."" then they would not have shunned them. 

I think it is precisely because of state support we can afford to take our relatives as lightly as friends or buddies and for example shun children for minor things, because we do not need to rely on them so hard.

The main reason it is not a prison BTW because it goes both ways. At young age people need their parents help, but without state social security, at old age people need their kids help. There is hard to find an actual example for that, of course, but I have close examples, people getting ridiculous pensions like €300 a month in Hungary... they do rely on their children. And that makes them totally understanding.

At any rate I understand it reduced freedom, but freedom is not the only value, it is not necessarily a good thing to maximize it if it also means maximizing isolation and alienation.

At any rate freedom is a young people thing anyway, we don't get much of it later on. Life at 20 was like fighting fiercly to live the way I want. At 30 life is more like so many things I need to get done, that there is not much freedom left. Right at the moment I am both working and trying to find someone who can  build a walk-in wardrobe which we absolutely need, squeezing in a little reddit when the work reports run.

Premièrement, il existe une différence entre '*décider que notre société* ***accepte*** *l'union de couples homosexuels*', et '*d’exiger de l’État* a ***participer*** *de maniéré officielle a une union d'homosexuels*'. Presque personne n'oppose le premier aspect, tandis que beaucoup de gens s'opposent au deuxième. Il ne faut donc pas les confondre.

Deuxièmement, il est parfaitement possible d'offrir des had hoc unions légales aux homosexuels avec les mêmes (si ils le veulent) droits. Mais pourquoi nécessairement un '***mariage***'? C'est même un peu ridicule, comme si on voulais prétendre qu'il s'agit d'un couple du genre papa-maman. Ce n'est pas le cas!

Troisièmement, faire appel a des vagues '***raisons rationnelles***' ne me dit rien. Des raisons '***rationnelles***' ne sont pas des raisons a peu prés logiques que l'on peut présenter de maniéré plus ou moins convaincante, pour les nécessites du '***political correctness***' du jour.  Pour être vraiment '***rationnelles***' elles doivent faire preuve d'une **vraie** cohérence. On doit donc se demander quelle logique éthique définît le mariage par exemple d'un homme avec deux femmes en t que ""*crime*'', mais le 'mariage' de deux mecs entre eux (une situation sûrement moins naturelle) en une chose non seulement légale mais immune de critique.

Quand on décide de faire de la polygamie un acte illégal, on le fait a base d'une éthique. On doit donc se demander: ""*Pourquoi est ce que la polygamie n' est pas permise?*' Et alors on doit **comprendre** ce pourquoi.  Et c' est alors, et avec une pensée cohérente appliquant la même éthique, que l'on doit évaluer les autres cas.

Obviously there is 100% pure capitalism and 100% pure socialism and people define it based on they how much they want, where they are on the line, but perhaps an objective definition is that only the non-essential aspects of the market are free from government regulation, and the government either regulates or provides or both the essentials like food, housing, healthcare or education. By that measure it would be hard to find any developed country that is not a social democracy, even the US is one, although of course much less than most of the EU. 

Now of course the stuff about reducing costs and serving industries instead of people... social democracy itself is a somewhat contradictory project: the market produces wealth by harsh incentives, and social democracy wants to reduce the harshness but somehow tries to keep the incentives because without the incentives the market will not work, then the government has to take over, and then you have soviet communism, not social democracy.

So I mean the essence of it is balancing the wealth-building harsh efficiency of the market with the incentive-destroying hence wealth-destroying egalitarian redistribution and caring.

Keeping it in mind, it is perfectly obvious that social democracy has to always keep into account the capitalist realisties, if industries are taxed heavily, they are also to be served by a properly trained workforce or else they have no incentive not to move to China, and of course social welfare programs must be designed with the goal of sending people back to work ASAP or else you will just have a bunch of lazy people abusing it.

So why couldn't I still be customer of an European operator? That is easy, because it couldn't be price competitive with operators who target their service into a single geographical area. Now you maybe asking where are the costs going to come from. Let me mention few reasons...

* In central Europe there is less airwaves per customer, even with more base stations, the network is more congested, and to ensure that network isn't congested operators price their packages based on those limits.
* There is more organizational package the larger the organization becomes, in short overheads can easily become enormous. Not to mention that big operators don't want to be bit pipes where as small operators can happily feel this position.
* There are more costs due to bigger systems: it is easier to create a small system for a market of 5 million than for a market of 500 million.

Kosovo became independent in 1999, they probably forgot to notify you. This is the de-facto case on the ground ever since.

All that followed afterwards was a silly game of paperwork, bureocracy and shit no one in the world cared about. And eventually that game ended, again, with Serbia's defeat, when the ICJ declared that Kosovo's declaration of independence was indeed legal.

Btw. Serbs are not a homogenous entity, just because you're passionate about Kosovo (the territory, not its people) doesn't mean everyone else is. As the '99 war has shown, Serbs would rather have peace than die for Kosovo. As the elections in 2008 have shown, Serbs would rather have a normal life than risk isolation from the international community because of Kosovo. I don't know what makes you think that ""every man in Serbia would rise up"" if Kosovo joined Albania. Based on past experiences, in my opinion, if such a thing happens, the only consequence would be some street riots in Belgrade, perhaps an embassy or two would be burned, that's it.",0,1349283314,null,0,false,0,c6h2ite,t3_10t4os,t1_c6h2ite,t1_c6gzvfv,null,1430054358,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Russia for one, Ukraine, China, Vietnam, India, Pakistan etc. Many of those countries are still a lot poorer than the average Greek, and they have certainly been fucked over in every single position on the planet (and do not even get me started on Africa). Thus, every time they run into trouble they should start disregarding previous treaties? So, if Russia are in financial hardship (and let's face it when are the Russians not, and the have a lower average income than the Greeks that is for certain) they should disregards the deals they have previously made with the US for example, since they are now broke. Good bye, nuclear treaties. Does that sounds like a good strategy to you? 

Second, if you want to talk about countries who suffered during the war, let us talk about Estonia and Poland. Poland was super destroyed and lost every 6th citizen during WWII - and after that they had an additional 50 years of communism. They are now, through the EU and the IMF contributing to the Greeks. And, let us mention Estonia that *ceased to exist* after WWII, still have a lower income, but are paying so the *Greeks do not have to live on their level*. 

Seriously, what makes the Greek situation so bloody unique, what make their suffering so much greater so that they, unlike all other countries can disregard treaties. Why are they so special? 

So, which treaties do you think should be followed? Apparently not the London Debt Agreement, which other treaties should be disregarded? I would really like a list of treaties you think can be ignored if one of the countries who signed it run into financial difficulties. Please, I am not kidding, I would love to see that list.

Greece ignored the stability pact, do you think that is OK too? Should every country in the world just ignore treaties if the economy is not OK (and trust me, in comparison to a lot of states, Greek people are rich)? 


Or, actually, I have another suggestion. I suggest, that Germany pays the remaining 7 billion USD, or, in fact, they double it. Let us say 20 billion USD. Then, Greece is on their own.

Outside of LWT, there are a couple things that can help you remember vocabulary that you've learned. 
First: *use* the new words! It's often not enough to study just once. Maybe when you learn new words, write down some sentences using them. Repeat the words out loud. Find or draw a little picture that you might associate with each word and study them together (this is especially helpful to visual learners).
Repetition is another method; once you see a word X amount of times, it will eventually stick. You could carry around a little piece of paper in your pocket with the word/words on it, then glance at it occasionally throughout the day, that way you can remind yourself every so often.

Also, if English is your first language, try finding similarities to English words or patterns (there are quite a few). For example, the apple = der Apfel, the man = der Mann, the chocolate = die Schokolade; ""s**i**ng, s**a**ng, s**u**ng"" = ""s**i**ngen, s**a**ng, ges**u**ngen.""

Furthermore, in German, compound words are common, and if you can break apart such a word into smaller pieces, then it will be easier to remember. For example, let's look at the word for hospital: das Krankhaus. Krank = sick; Haus = house. Literally it means ""sick house"" which is, rather crudely put, what a hospital is. Another (kind of funny) example would be ""der Kühlschrank."" Kühl = cold; Schrank = closet. Cold closet = refrigerator.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; Something I'm really curious about: Did the labour liberalization have the benefits it is supposed to have? Is it now easier to get a new position as a result of it? Is the labour market really more flexible now?

I think the aim was to enable companies to take more risks and thus grow more. In this sense I think labour market changes have definitely succeeded. The side benefit of strong growth has been that there is strong need for labour and that has made it easier to get hired and to change jobs.

&gt; Low paying jobs here are mainly created by using loopholes in new legislation that sprung up in the past years and allow the employers to skip having to pay social security contributions or allow them to circumvent wages set by unions. I won't go into details since that would probably be boring. But it's used on jobs that can't be outsourced. Cashiers, cleaning personnel, warehouse workers, service workers in general.

From time to time there has been voices demanding the same kind of changes in here too, however those voices haven't gotten much response. I think part of the reason for this is that tax benefits or contribution relief are seen as subsidies and the problem with subsidies is that they corrupt the market and support unprofitable business. Another part is that all workers should be treated equally, it would be wrong for example make different rules for young workers, etc...

Of course here too there are problems. Before the financial crisis there was much talk about rent workers being in a bit of a bad place. They do have work contract with the rent firm, but their contract says that they called to work, this is problematic because if they don't get called to work, then they can't get unemployment benefits, they could get social benefits, but getting them requires fighting with bureaucracy.

So while there is clearly detectable genetic differences when you take two ppl from different continents (or whose ancestors lived so remotely until evolutionary recent times), there are no 'nature's joints' anywhere between neighbouring populations to split them up into distinct groups.

“I had long discussions with the parents. I told them that their children’s needs had always been neglected. The parents accepted me as a caregiver. I worked in that kindergarten for two years. The children were between two and five years old. I played with them an awful lot, romped with the children, I completely identified with them. I wanted the children to like me, and I did everything that they became dependent. With the children, I became aware that this need of making others dependent actually existed in all my relationships. My constant flirts with all children began to assume erotic features. I could feel how little five-year old girls had learnt to turn me on. Several times there were children that opened my fly and started to caress me. Depending on the situation, I reacted differently, but their wish faced me with problems. I asked them: ‘Why don’t you play with each other, why have you chosen me and not the other children?’ But when they insisted, I allowed them to caress me.”

Theoretically, Romania is a social democracy. It says so in the constitution, but I wouldn't consider Romania a social democracy in practice.

We don't have universal healthcare. First of all, it's not universal: you're not covered just by being a citizen living here, which means that plenty of people are left uninsured. (most of the uninsured are the poor working without any papers and gypsies, so many Romanians think it's fair) Then, many MDs in state hospitals (and virtually everyone working there) require informal bribes/payments before treating you, even though that's illegal.

Theoretically, we have social security: practically, if you're poor and without any income, the state gives you 125 RON (27 euro) a month. That's not enough to feed yourself, let alone get you a place to live, hence the large numbers of homeless people in Bucharest. The only place where I've seen so many homeless was in the US.

There are some useful pointers on the right bar of this subreddit, check it out.

1. Asking for vegetarian dishes is totally ok, nobody will get offended. However, you may want to check  with each restaurant if they have vegetarian dishes (""piatti vegetariani"") before sitting at the table.

2. You seem to be nice people, it would be really hard for you to come out as ""rude"". As you said some cliches (backpack, socks while wearing flip-flops) will identify you as american tourists. That's not a bad thing, however you may want to avoid that to dodge the undesirable attention of pick-pocketers (it's not that bad in most cities, still, they go for the easiest prey, so you'll better not look like one).

3. Usually, bus for city-wide travel, plane or train for long-haul travels. I would not recommend to rent a car. My experience is that American drivers are usually way too polite to survive Italian traffic.

4. Not really. 

5. I don't like soccer, I'll let someone else answer this question.

Look, the fact is, Kosovo gained independence in 1999, and gained legality for its independence after the ICJ decision. Case closed. I know you could probably talk forever about this, bring up various links which would, in your opinion, prove that you're right, but it won't change the fact on the ground that Kosovo is independent and recognized as such by the international community.

Since it's independent, it has the right to decide whether it wants to give some territory to Serbia or not. So far the Kosovo government doesn't want this.

&gt; I'm passionate about the land, and its people -- more specifically, the Serbs

But Kosovo is 90% Albanian, so you can't say you're passionate about Kosovo. Maybe about Northern Kosovo? And let's be more specific about this, how is it that you express this passion? For example, I'm passionate about cooking, so I spend a significant amount of my monthly income on various spices and foodstuffs, I spend a lot of time learning about how to make food... How much % of your monthly income do you give to Kosovo Serbs? Do you spend your time on issues related to Kosovo, for example by learning Albanian so you could understand the other side? Or do you just like to talk how you're passionate and argue with strangers on the internet about it?

true,Deusdies,EART,Earth,"&gt; Effectively this then means that skinheads, by threats of violence, have the last word on public policy in Belgrade.

While I can see where you're coming from, but this is not entirely true; the government decision was based on benefits vs cost, materially. The benefits of the parade taking place are close to 0, and the costs would be enormous. The damage done 2 years ago was measured in hundreds of millions.

Do I agree with this decision by my government? Absolutely. Am I happy for it? No. But I would rather not have the violence erupt because a few hundred people decided to march to raise awareness over something. The Serbian people do not generally accept the gay population. Whether this is right or wrong is not the question here and it cannot be universally decided, but the current state of things is that we do not.

A pride parade of a couple hundred people involved in it is not worth injuring a couple hundred officers and civilians, in addition to the collateral damage that we would have. 

Even if we had a hundred thousand police officers securing this thing, it would still be impossible to completely prevent violence. A pride parade will only be worth it when the threat of violence caused by it becomes 0, or at least close to 0. 

EDIT: I also wouldn't say that the rest of the nation is entirely apathetic towards it. In fact, I am willing to bet that there are more people are against the parade than there are for it. This is why they choose to do nothing instead of organizing our own march in support of pride parade. It's just that vast majority of people are not extremists thankfully.

I'm a US citizen (Texan, as the name implies).  I moved to the UK to study for my master's in medieval English literature, graduated and got onto a post-study work visa (this was in 2008, before they abolished it) and found a job.  I worked in the job for almost two years before I was downsized.  When my post-study visa was up, I tried to apply for a Tier 1 visa but was rejected because I had earned less than £20k in the year before I applied (because there are so many entry-level jobs for people with medieval studies degrees that pay &gt;£20k). :/

In the three years I lived in the UK I paid my taxes, volunteered in my local community, had a serious relationship with a British guy and was planning to go on to do another degree in libraries/archives at UCL to work in medieval book/manuscript conservation -- but none of that mattered, and even when I appealed the decision I was told I had to GTFO.  I'm still trying to move back to the UK, but obviously it's a very steep mountain to climb at the moment, and getting steeper all the time.

Edit to say: obviously I wasn't married to a Brit and I had only been there three years, so my case is nowhere NEAR as extreme and unfair as this guy's, but it's unfortunately a very common story.

Pour l'inceste, c'est un résidu de la tradition. Le mariage étant une consécration de la famille dont le prolongement est la procréation... Vu que l'inceste ammène à des troubles génétiques graves, il a été rejeté par le christianisme. Depuis, c'est resté. Cela poserait aussi problème en matière de succession puisqu'elle est réglée en fonction de la position des membres de la famille. Il faudrait alors modifier un tas de choses pour l'accepter (quotité des parts de la personne en fonction de son statut de conjoint et de membre de la famille, par exemple), en plus de déroger au principe fondamental de ce pan du droit (i.e : transmission à la génération suivante). L'inceste est très peu accepté d'un point de vue moral, même s'il est légalement toléré (entre personnes consentantes et majeures). Il ne répond néanmoins pas à un cadre de famille convenable an sens traditionnel.
  
La polygamie pose différents problèmes puisqu'elle multiplierait les relations juridiques et donc rendrait plus complexe le droit matrimonial, qui n'est déjà pas si simple. Il suffit d'imaginer tous les liens qui pourrait exister entre les différents parents et enfants, en cas de propriété pour les biens acquis au cours du mariage, pour les biens lors du divorce, répartition des biens en cas de décès, les droits et devoirs entre chaque membres des couples, etc. Sur un plan sociétal, cela chamboulerait aussi la structure bicéphale du mariage. En gros, c'est une grosse partie de notre droit civil, de ses principes philosophiques, juridiques et sociaux, qui seraient remis en question.
  
L'homosexualité pose beaucoup moins de problème puisqu'elle repose sur une structure semblable au couple traditionnel : c'est-à-dire deux personnes. Techniquement, en droit, ça revient juste à retirer le genre dans les textes. Et moralement, ça revient juste à accepter que deux personnes s'aimant puissent accéder à un cadre législatif adéquat et à une célébration regroupant (légalement et symboliquement) deux familles (ce que le PACS fait différemment). Pour l'adoption, c'est plus délicat, certes... mais si cela peut permettre à des enfants de vivre dans de meilleurs conditions...

Regardless, those students that want to study do learn things, and those that don't want to still learn to an extent though not as much. Regardless, there's far more cross-cultural and life-skills learning than you'd get just doing that one semester in your home university.

&gt;That would surely do much more to foster ""Europe-wide respect and understanding"" than give some students a vacation-like experience with no guarantee of them pursuing a career in their field of study (and thus hopefully make use of their newly aquired connections) or even keep much in touch with their newly acquired connections once they finished their degree.

These days long travels in Italy are cheaper and faster by plane. Shorter/medium distances will do fine with the train. City bus systems will save you a lot in cab rides.

When you're in Rome, climb to the top of St Peters Basilica, and enjoy a view of the entire city. Please go to Positano. Easily the most beautiful place I saw over my 6 weeks in Italy over the summer. If you do go - Casa Cosenza is an amazing place for the money (especially in Positano).

The number of people is irrelevant, what the goverment is supposed to protect are fundamental rights and legal principles. As a state, you can not simply attach a cost to a fundamental right and say you wont protect it if it gets more expensive than that. The extremists then can get rid of a fundamental right simply by driving up the cost of protecting it.

What you are essentially suggesting is that as long as right-wingers do not allow it, homosexuals in Serbia will *never* get equal rights because the goverment is not willing to protect them because protecting them costs too much.

The statue you want to identify is the one in the middle, if i'm not mistaken ( considering the ""book/scroll/tablet"" she holds in her left hand) 

It looks like wikipedia is wrong in stating that the statues are allegories of Orleans, Bordeaux and Nantes : on [this page](http://ponticellidellarte.over-blog.com/pages/Le_Musee_dOrsay-516667.html), the statues are said to represent Bordeaux , Nantes and **Toulouse**

Now, if you look carefully at the statue in the pic of the facade, you'll notice some crest below her right hand. 
You'll notice two towers on each side of the crest and below some kind of animal. 
Now [here](http://www.ostaldoccitania.net/img/istoria/blason_toulouse.png) is the crest of Toulouse, which looks a lot like the one on the statue. 

So I guess the name of the statue you're looking for is : Toulouse 

Edit : And according to [this page](http://patrimap.paris.fr/fr-FR/curiosities/1295-musee-d-orsay) ,the sculptor is  Laurent-Honoré Marqueste ( who was born in Toulouse !). And according to [this document pdf](http://www.chanot-rossignol.fr/_rubr/baud/orsay_visite_zanaglia.pdf) the model for the three statues was the wife of the architect Victor Laloux.

&gt; And that you can't put your eggs in the same basket. During winter we may need 10 - 25 times more energy (or even more) if there is like minus 35 celsius for a week.

Exactly. That's where nuclear power comes into play. You will have enough electricity to deal with the cold months, and when there's a surplus of energy being produced you can sell it to other countries instead.

&gt; Then we start up the reserve coal plants and other, like peat. btw coal (bad) and nuclear (even worse)...

Coal power has killed more people than nuclear power ever has, and the resulting pollution will kill plenty more if global warming is indeed man-made.

&gt; If that's true, why then a AAA country Germany and Japan are getting rid of it?

Germany is getting rid of it because the ignorant public demands it. Japan is getting rid of it partly for the same reason, and partly because they realize that they cannot commit to the maintenance of such a facility in the relatively dangerous environment they live in.

&gt; And why Denmark is putting huge amounts of money in wind power? Is it even the leading country on manufacturing wind turbines etc.? Are you trying to promote this ""utterly awesome and orgasticaly superior"" nuclear power just to get people's eyes of the avoidable next energy boom: wind?

It's pretty complicated. Denmark is investing loads into windpower for ideological reasons, but economical as well. Vestas - one of the world's largest wind turbine producers - is partly owned by the Danish state, I believe, and that a relatively large percentage of Denmark's electricity comes from windpower sends a very positive marketing message, because they use it to show that it is possible to replace a decent percentage of the fossil fueled sector with renewables. Denmark has received a huge amount of positive PR as a result of small transition to renewables. We cash in on this in the form of tourism and increased foreign investments in Danish companies.

But we are still constructing coal plants, because it is just not possible yet to have a stable and functional energy sector based on renewables alone, and nor is it economical. What I am saying is that instead of building our infrastructural spine with coal plants, a better alternative would be nuclear powerplants.",0,1349304457,null,0,false,0,c6h8osc,t3_10uti7,t1_c6h8osc,t1_c6gw7kq,null,1430057353,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Mi ritenevo una straniera in Italia pur essendo ovviamente di cognome italiano, di cultura italoamericana e con dei tratti fisici tipicamente mediterranei (cioe' quando vivevo nella Sicilia dei nonni tutti mi prendevano sempre per siciliana doc). Sono straniera perche' non sono nata e cresciuta in Italia. Punto e basta. 

Putroppo in molti parti d'Italia c'e' gente in giro che ha delle idee molto chiare su come sono fatti gli italiani doc, quelli 'veraci' per intenderci. Queste persone credono che gli stranieri siano cittadini di seconda classe e di conseguenza gli stranieri non vanno trattati come esseri umani.

...do you really need a ""source"" for energy companies activities and wife-swapping with politicians? Denmark has said that they even could govern the North Pole and not because there is few ice-bears...

&gt;Exactly. That's where nuclear power comes into play. You will have enough electricity to deal with the cold months, and when there's a surplus of energy being produced you can sell it to other countries instead.

No, it's exactly not. In Finland we create also heat (hot, high pressured water going under insulated piping) for the towns and villages. This is done buy burning materials. Nuclear power is too dangerous and far away to do this. At winter we have many small units all around and near populations. Nuclear plants gives the basic electricity to the grid and could increase some amounts, but not nearly enough. The temperature can go suddenly from 0 degrees celsius to minus 40 degr. celsius. And it can stay long on those cold high pressure weather bubbles, like two weeks. Ukraine, Poland and other south European countries have suffered from this lately. People are getting rid of heating with electricity, because the prize of that is growing up way too fast. At least those who can.

&gt;Coal power has killed more people than nuclear power ever has, and the resulting pollution will kill plenty more if global warming is indeed man-made.

Nuclear power... hmmm... let's see, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Cherno, Fukushima.... Can you make an Coal-Bomb that'll be as big bang as nuclear power bomb?

But fuck that coal shit, yeah, it's smelly and black and shit. Instead let's do something awesomely complicated and split uranium-plutonium and evrynium to boil water what runs by steam a huge propel that gets the axle turning and that huge dynamo sparking...

Because our political and other leaders in Finland have failed hard in nuclear power (we've lost over 10billion euros), we, the Finnish people, are taking this time some heavy...

No, thankfully this is not the case. But extremists with the backing of 80% of the nation? Yes. 

&gt; To you. To the homosexuals the benefit is to be able to perceive basic human rights, like everybody else. Imagine living in a state that legally treats you like a second-rate human.

I was talking about material benefits, which even for them, is 0. I am not sure how a parade would make them not be 2nd-class citizens since it won't really accomplish anything - in fact, it may just make the people hate them more (you hear conversations like ""why do they need to organize the parade? It'll just cause violence. Do what you want but don't parade about it"").

&gt; The number of people is irrelevant, what the goverment is supposed to protect are fundamental rights and legal principles. As a state, you can not simply attach a cost to a fundamental right and say you wont protect it if it gets more expensive than that. The extremists then can get rid of a fundamental right simply by driving up the cost of protecting it.

The government is following legal principles. Our law states that public gatherings can take place as long as there is no significant threat to the security. Gay rights are not fundamental rights in Serbia. The right to protest/have an awareness walk is not a fundamental right either. 

The homosexual rights in Serbia will only improve if/when the people of Serbia start accepting them into the society. No government intervention can change that. The government is supposed to represent the people - right now, the vast majority of people (not skinheads) do not want the parade to take place. Even if it did take place, this would not change people's minds, or it would change for the worse as I mentioned above.

Again, I implore you to understand that extremists are only part of the problem here: the bigger picture is the vast majority of our nation who do not support gay rights and who do agree with the extremists, it's just that they do not want to smash things.


&gt; It's just that vast majority of people are not extremists thankfully.

Right, but not because we're afraid or anything, but because we agree with them like I said. You could also argue that gays are extremists as well (in our case) - but to the left.

In Sweden they had Finnish classes for Finns. Finns immigrated in big numbers to Sweden during 1960's and 1970's. Why we should not respect immigrants who come to our land? Finns quite easily forget what the other world has given to our people who have immigrated, and the number is high; over 1.000.000 Finns have left this country during depressions and after civil war.

true,ChickenChickenNugget,null,null,"Well, knowing two Latin languages (and English) is sure to help, but you're still gonna have a LOT of work to do learning french. EU citizens are free to move between member states to live, work, study in another country, you'll still have some paperwork to do, but if you hold some kind of valid EU ID, that'll help greatly.
 You'll get permanent residence in any given member state if you maintain an uninterrupted five year period of legal residence, which makes a nice step before applying for citizenship (becoming a citizen being a bureaucratic nightmare, really).
The bad news : You have to get a fluent understanding of French if you want to get a job. Most employers won't bother hiring someone that barely speaks the language, and unemployement is high enough to make sure you'll have several people competing for the job. 
Get your degree, entering the job market in France without a paper showing you sat in an university classroom for years is like bringing a duck to a cockfight.
US degrees tend to be widely accepted in Europe, so normally you won't have troubles applying in an university or any equivalent system.
About learning French, I don't know where you live, but check if there is an [Alliance Française](http://www.alliance-us.org/) nearby, it's their job to make you discover French, French culture and the like.

Racism is passed down like religion, there's no logic behind it. A man's potential isn't capped by his skin colour, or what god he worships. 

It's much easier to breed an attitude of us vs them when both sides of the conflict are poor. 

Now, when it comes to culture it gets messy, the new western way of life, liberalism and ""the pursuit of happiness"" is superior to repression under a ancient code of law. But the problem is can two cultures coexist together? If both groups of people are happy, their basic needs, and their luxury needs are being met then they will probably coexist peacefully if not with much interaction. If one or both groups isn't having their needs met then that's when the problems arise, resentment either warranted or not appears on both sides and we end up with racial tensions. Obviously this is what is happening in places like Bradford and in other poorer regions. And this is one of the scenarios where racism/extremism breeds freely.

[Florence restaurants](http://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/wlob1/sapreste_consigliarmi_dei_buoni_ristoranti_a/)





1) We have vegetarians in Italy, they're not so many but most of restaurants are used to the request of a vegetarian meal. In bigger cities you can also find some specific vegetarian-only restaurants, I can't speak for Florence, but in Rome there are many.

2) jeans are widely wore in Italy, don't worry! Also shorts during summer (avoid long socks with shorts!), but starting from september it's better to switch back to long pants. Sneakers and running shoes are also widely used, and I suggest you to actually use them since there's a lot to walk when you're touristing around! Maybe opt for black, in this way sneakers look less sporty and a bit more elegant. Avoid white and bright colours and you're fine with the shoes. Hats depend on your age and on the hat type. Adults usually wear hats just in winter and during summer just on the beach. Backpacks are mostly used by younger people, adults go for bags, yes even males.

3) I'm a driving lover and I don't use public trasport that much, but trains are not bad if you're lucky enough not to get into strikes. Trains will deliver you right into the heart of a city, while airports are always quite far, meaning you'll have to spend extra money on taxis/bus/train to get to the city.

4) this is also covered in our faq, but the main suggestions are: 

to avoid like plague ordering cappuccino with meals. Cappuccino and Latte (which is called latte macchiato, latte means just plain milk) are to be consumed just for breakfast or maybe during winter as an afternoon treat together with a pastry. Order that with a meal and people around you will look at you in pure disgust and mutter ""'mmerigani..."".

be very careful to pickpockets in touristy spots and crowded places like buses and metro.

avoid always talking like you just swallowed a bull-horn, expecially in museums or churches. Maybe it's not your case but the majority of americans I dealt with are really really loud, and I have a loud voice...

5) Don't go dressed with the jersey/scarf of the team playing away in Florence (or anywhere else!) Curva Fiesole is the ultras sector. If you want to watch the match in the most hot and messy area, where people chants, shouts and always waves flags, go for that. If you like to watch the match seated and surrounded by families and more calm people go to Tribuna Maratona. Remeber you have to provide a valid I.d. to purchase the ticket. Closed Bottles are not allowed in the stadium, so caps will be removed. Also lighters and umbrellas are not allowed. If you're a smoker hide the lighter in your underpants or in your wife's bra, you can also do that with a spare bottle cap, so you can close the bottle when inside.

I made amazing new friends (that more than a year later, Im still friends with), I learnt new languages, I learnt to take care of myself far away from home and more importantly I lost all fear of going abroad to work/live/study from that moment on. Thanks to the Erasmus programme I was able to see myself more as an european and less as a man from my country and if it wasn't for the amazing time I had there I wouldn't be looking for a job abroad (in europe) now.

true,Impedence,UKGB,United Kingdom,"Well, this is interesting.

The ERASMUS budget for the academic year 2010 and 2011 is this:

&gt; [In 2010-11 the total budget was around €460 million, of which €435 million was dedicated to support for mobility.](http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/12/310)

In comparison to an above inflation increasing annual EU budget: 

&gt; [The overall budget for next year will amount to EUR 129.1 billion (1.86 % increase) in payments and EUR 147.2 billion (+3.8 %) in commitments.](http://ec.europa.eu/budget/figures/2012/2012_en.cfm)

However, as the article linked to by the OP says:

&gt; *French conservative member of the European Parliament, Alain Lamassoure, who heads the budget committee, said that ""the European social fund is bankrupt and can't refund member states.*

&gt; *""Next week it will be Erasmus, the student programme, at the end of the month, the Research and Innovation Fund.""*

Which makes the part toward the end of the article where Britain is denounced for trying to put the brakes on the budget rises

&gt; *Britain, which led efforts to trim the 2012 EU budget, was shooting itself in the foot, he added, denouncing what he termed ""an absurd situation.""*

Sound a little bit cheeky to me. Personally I am not sure about ERASMUS, I can see what it is trying to do to increase the mobility of labour in the EU, and at least there are more than a handful of people benefiting from it. However, in my opinion, for those deciding the EU budget to decide that the response to not getting a budget increase is to completely wipe out a relatively popular (by EU standards) 25 year old program, they do appear to be making a somewhat poor decision of what to cut.",0,1349342680,null,0,1349346810,0,c6hgmeb,t3_10vohn,t1_c6hgmeb,t3_10vohn,null,1430061134,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3
