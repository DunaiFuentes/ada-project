If you read the programm of the Linke it is very easy to see the connection between the Linke and the GDR:

&gt;DIE LINKE knüpft an linksdemokratische Positionen und Traditionen aus &gt;der sozialistischen, sozialdemokratischen und kommunistischen &gt;Arbeiterbewegung sowie aus feministischen und anderen &gt;emanzipatorischen Bewegungen an. Wir bündeln politische &gt;Erfahrungen aus der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik und der &gt;Bundesrepublik Deutschland.

and

&gt;Um dies zu erreichen, brauchen wir ein anderes Wirtschafts- und &gt;Gesellschaftssystem: den demokratischen Sozialismus.


maybe this one:

&gt;Die Deutsche Demokratische Republik ist ein sozialistischer Staat ... (Art. 1 VerfDDR)

It should be demonstrated, that the Linke is very close to the SED.

Many waiters will speak English in Paris, so that should help you out.

""Ah ok, shellfish then."" ""No shellfish."" ""Bon du chevre alors..."" etc. etc. I've had that happen.

It's ok to just repeat yourself as many times as necessary. If you're very worried you could memorize an explanation of veganism (par ex: ""Je suis végétalien, c'est un choix d'alimentation où tout produit d'origine animale est supprimé, y compris les produits laitiers."") and rattle that off, but you'll definitely get the message across with ""Y-a-til aucun produit d'origine animale dans ce plat?"" If your French is nonexistant just point and ask about anything you're worried about: ""Viande? Lait? Fromage? Beurre?"" As long as you're polite you'll be all right. 

I'd honestly be more worried about just finding a restaurant that actually has vegan food than being accidentally served food you can't eat. I doubt you'll be able to walk into very many places and find anything at all on the menu (veggie maybe, vegan not so sure).

When the wall came down this protected economy seized to exist, so the prices had to be adjusted to the international market.

That wasn't fully realized until late 1990 because that was when many of the earlier contracts ran out - but still months before reunification.

Incidentally this all happened at the end of an economic down-turn in West-Germany. Most of their factories ran way under their production maximum. For me that is the most amazing (and tragic) thing about the reunification process - the western industry simply took over much over much of the production of the East without having to invest in any new factories. The East lost their factories simply because they weren't needed - and this is the reason why the map looks like it does. 

Again, very much comes down to how the east-Germans reacted. They **wanted** the Mark and they didn't want east-German products. There were many items that were just as good and much cheaper, so they should have been very competitive (washing detergent comes to mind) - but people just stopped buying them.

To be fair I am biased because I am from India, and in India every driver thinks they can drive however they want because rules are for idiot drivers, and not for excellent drivers like themselves. Better to be a stickler to rules than play chicken with a car.

When you're denied basic rights from your state based on your sexuality, it is no longer a private matter.

That's why pride parades are necessary, especially in countries like Ukraine. It is important to demonstrate to the Ukrainian people that homosexuality is nothing to be feared, and that there is no justice in discriminating on those grounds.

If large countries like Italy default on their debts, it will cause a whole scale depression in all Europe, Finland including. We will have rollbacks of the welfare state and extensive austerity measures to deal with the loss in GDP, on a scale only seen in the beginning of the 90s. None of us wants to go through that again. This is where we're headed if we do nothing to help Southern Europe. Now if there's anything we can do to alleviate this problem, with a lesser cost to our citizens than a depression, we owe it to ourselves to try. And Italy owes it to everyone else to try as well. The only way to avoid a depression at this point is working together. It may prove at some point that we can’t do anything to avoid it, but at least for now that point hasn’t yet been reached.

I do agree with you on the transparency and need to be honest about all the deals made in the EU. Far too often people are left uncertain of what is actually happening and this generates both distrust and anger. Politicians are trapped in not being able to really describe the gravity of the situation for fear of alarming the markets and then not being able to wholly explain to their constituents why the measures taken are needed to remedy the situation. Nevertheless, trying to hide the real costs for fear of a populist backlash isn’t helping anyone. Honesty and ‘we’re doing everything we can’ is much more likely to produce positive results.

Regarding ‘I am not saying that they can't btw, I am just saying that decades of mismanagement will not be washed away in a few months, particularely when they haven't even elected their PM. ‘, 
I don’t think it can be either. I just think this is the only shot we’re going to get.

It strikes me as interesting that people would be so intent on having others follow small rules that are in place for _their_ protection.  

I also see more police hassling bicyclists and pedestrians for extremely minor infractions (i.e. listening to music, going the ""wrong way"" down a bike path even when there's only a path on one side, or it's extremely wide, etc.) than doing real police shit.

I lived in Paris for 4 years, and liked the attitude there - pedestrians and bicyclists were ""flexible"" about the rules, but I never once saw a motorist endanger a bicyclist or pedestrian or run a red light.   Whereas here, I see cars blazing over intersections just as the light turns red all the time, and have almost been run over twice on my bike when I had a green light and the other guy a red light - and was shouted at for it.  Generally I get a really bad vibe from people around me, despite making every effort to be courteous and polite (I'm a really relaxed, cautious bicyclist so not some demon riding down pedestrians like crazy on the sidewalk).

true,Ozires,FINL,Finland,"‘I don't see, if you go all in like you suggest, how you can not sign away several percent of you GDP for the foreseeable future.’ I agree. There is going to be a cost no matter what. I still think it’s going to be a lesser cost to rebuild the Southern European economies, than what it’s going to be if we let them default. Especially since while rebuilding them, there won’t be a fall as deep and a recovery as long as it would otherwise be. And all of Europe is going to have to bear the cost together. Of course, the countries with stronger economies and AAA ratings are going to take the brunt of it, but there’s no real scenario in which we they end up getting shafted. 

‘If they were, people would be outraged and refuse.’ Perhaps this is being optimistic, but I think if clearly explained the situation and given the choice more people would choose as I do. The problem with the looming depression is that no one can really know how bad it’ll end up being. It’s bad, but there’re so many continuances especially when the USA is put into the mix that it’s just impossible to estimate. Given this and getting the politicians’ and economists’ numbers on what is needed to avoid a chaos, I’m inclined to choose the option with some remaining certainty. 

Anyways, I really respect your opinion and I wish thoughts like that would be voiced more often. If more people thought like you, maybe politicians would have the spine to tell their constituents the truth. All you’ve said about what the EZ leaders are likely to do is true. Just like the US stimulus package wasn’t large enough to be wholly effective, the European leaders are also likely to come up with just half-measures. But I’m still hoping that while the end draws closer, they’ll be forced to an agreement that will actually be enough. It probably won’t be presented as openly and clearly as it should be, and I doubt it’ll be democratic either. Though to be completely honest, I’m not sure if direct democracy would even work in this situation anymore. Perhaps a majority of people are so tired with the way things’ve been handled, they’d vote down anything (this as opposed to voting it down because they believe it to be a worse solution than the alternative). We’ll just have to judge it by its merits when it comes. If it’ll save the EZ, it’ll most likely do so by stronger integration. Luckily, there’s an outcry for more democratic rule in the EU, so if there’s going to be any change to the treaties, changes to make the Union more democratic will very likely be included.

Firstly, I must have missed the bit in the article where he actually *argues* that (the first assertion he makes). He just *assumes* it. He *starts* with the premise that anyone who is a Eurosceptic must fit the above statement, which is hardly fair. I'm broadly pro-Europe, but even I can see that the sceptics that fit the above description are very much in the minority, and are more likely to be with the nutters in UKIP than in the Tory party. 

Secondly, you're not going to convince the *actual* Eurosceptics of your argument if the very first thing you say is effectively an insult. The rest of the article is an argument that we (Europe) need to band together to resist the worlds future demographic and economic changes, but it does not necessarily follow that the sole solution to the issue is a federal Europe.

Horseshit. I have no such obligation and unless you can provide an actual source for this obligation to emanate from then I'm going to reject it out of hand.

I disregard all rules I disagree with so long as the benefit of breaking the rule exceeds the likely cost of doing so. So do most people. If you want people to obey rules, the rules have to make sense to people.

&gt;you are making life harder for everyone.

Actually I'm making life much easier for myself, I save time every single day by jaywalking, and if that means that some parent sometimes has to say to their kids not to follow my example, that's up to them, but it's *on* them - their choice to have kids doesn't magically impart responsibility upon me to look after those kids.

&gt;&gt;Zu Ihrem Blog-Beitrag „Handstreich im Bundestag“ möchten wir darauf hinweisen, dass alle Änderungsanträge der Koalitionsfraktionen von den beiden innenpolitischen Sprechern der Fraktionen von CDU/CSU (Dr. Uhl) und FDP (Piltz) an den Innenausschuss übersandt werden. Dem gehen regelmäßig Berichterstattergespräche in den Fraktionen voraus, ebenso die Abstimmung in den Fraktionen mit den federführenden und mitberatenden Arbeitsgruppen.

&gt;&gt;[...]

&gt;&gt;Alle Änderungsanträge müssen von den jeweiligen Fraktionen bzw. den dort zuständigen Gremien (Arbeitsgruppen) beraten und beschlossen werden, bevor der formale Akt der Übersendung durch die Sprecher erfolgt. Insofern ist der Blog-Beitrag irreführend. Die Entscheidungsfindungsprozesse im Deutschen Bundestag lassen derartige „Alleingänge“ nicht zu.

This is the case.  They form a clearly marked part of the sidewalk, totally separate from the street (which is awesome).  They're pretty wide bike lanes too, and yet, a lot of people panic and swerve out of the way when they see you coming.  Recently, a guy was nice enough to pull over and warn me that the police were a bit further down, fining cyclists for going the ""wrong"" way on such a bicycle lane (you have to understand that these are _huge_ sidewalks, with almost nobody using them - it made zero sense.

I agree about going the wrong way down the street (although tbh, if it's on a quiet residential street, I really don't see the issue) - this is why it's cool that so many one-way streets are clearly marked ""OK for bicycles"".

There just seems to be an attitude with the police of ""we must rigorously enforce _ALL_ the rules"" as opposed using common sense.  It's of course their job to enforce rules, and as a guest I have to respect that, but I still find it bizarre how much they seem to disproportionately focus on going after pedestrians and cyclists as opposed to some of the fucking insane behavior I see in traffic (speeding like crazy, really aggressive tailgating, cutting off bikers like I described, double parking all over the place, etc.)

true,Ozires,FINL,Finland,"We certainly do. 

Still it was only 20% of the people who voted for our only anti-Euro or Europe party and now their support has dropped to under 15%, I think there's a silent majority that wants to avoid a depression and still trusts our politicians to do what’s right. We had a real scare in the early 90s and I think that’s still in the memory of a lot of the older folks. Most importantly, the effects of the crisis haven’t really reached Finland yet. Our economic growth has stopped, but the average person on the street isn’t really feeling it. It’s been rehashed in the news, but I doubt many people think anything’s going to drastically change. It’ll just go on like it always has before. So, some people complain vocally, but most just ignore it and go on with their lives. Though, this is also a cause to the false belief that a European depression won’t affect Finland. I can't really claim any omniscient knowledge about the Finnish mentality, but I do think it's a bit different with Finland than Sweden, because we're already in the think of it and there's not that much for people to do about it. They're waiting to see what the politicians come up with. Also, in all fairness, it is quite likely given all the planets we’ve discovered recently, that there is life somewhere else in our galaxy, not to speak of the universe. So we can’t at least rule out the existence UFOs, though the fact that any would have actually visited us seems rather unlikely. 

And, in the short range of course, I don’t think there’s going to be any democratic changes. Though, one needs to remember that the deals made right now are made by the democratically elected representatives of our governments in the EU summits. We don’t exactly hold referendums on the things our governments decide in domestic policy either. And most of this deals with financial policy. Americans don’t get to vote on what the Fed does either, we just vote on whether the politicians did the right thing in the next parliamentary elections. Perhaps the problem is exactly that the decisions are made by politicians that haven’t been voted on to specifically deal with these EU-related issues. 

But just like with the treaty of Lisbon, there’s going to be more institutional changes towards the parliament having more control in the legislation (since this is what the EU does the most) and I can see it structurally developing more towards an American model (two chambers, less representatives, less bureaucracy). The main democracy-deficit is with the Commission and its leadership. This should be addressed in further treaties, but changing those is of course going to take years. 

I think there’s hopeful news too. Greece’s elected government, that’s vowing to implement the bailout rules, just received a vote of confidence. I think that’s a good sign, it proves the Greeks even in this dire situation wanted to work to stay in the Euro and reform their country; a triumph of democracy if there ever was one.  

And on the banking union and bailout plans, well, we don’t really know what they’ll be like yet. They were being very vague on what the June summit accomplished. Losses are jointly assumed, but we don’t know yet whether the banks’ shareholders will bear the most of them or whether they’ll be full on the taxpayers. And we don’t know yet what the ECB’s supervision is going to be like either. In fact I’d be more inclined to think that if they instituted the regulatory framework needed to insure that banks won’t incur unrealistic levels of at-risk debt and that national governments will have to balance their budgets and stop solving the problem by issuing more bonds at unsustainable prices, it would be best to make the ECB the lender of last resort and that way stop the rising interest rates on government bonds, thereby stopping the spread of the debt crisis. I doubt using the EFSF and the ESM will be sufficient to calm the markets, and anyways they don’t have the same sort of powers as a central bank does.

Let me tell you my little story of bribe requests. I worked for a Big International Corporation (BIC) doing some software for a Big Romanian Government Agency (BRGA). 

Because the project was partly funded from World Bank's funds, the BRGA had to choose BIC to make the software, not BRGA director's cousin's company, as it is customary in Romanian government's projects.

However, as the project was getting close to the end, BRGA kept finding things that were not ok: they always wanted things differently from the way they were, they wanted the user interface more ""friendly"" without telling how it should be and so on. 

After two years of this (with the BIC's project starting to run into negative numbers -- don't worry, they make it up with the hardware part -- asking $2000 for a $200 CPU), the directors of the BIC and BRGA find the solution: PIC will pay $300,000 for a small and crappy web app (part of the project) to be made by two programmers in a month at a company that belongs to a friend of BRGA's director.

The project is finally approved by BRGA.

* By ""tax on pensions"" I think you mean the contribution to the state-owned health insurance provider, which is chronically underfunded in Romania, this also being the reason behind the closure of some (not countless) hospitals, and the merging of others. Similar reform measures were taken by the new government.

* The child punching story was never proven, and a defamation suit was won because of it.

* The newest of the ships sold while Basescu was minister of transportation was 17 years old and had reached its retirement age. This was acknowledged even by a parliamentary inquiry committee set up by his political enemies.

* Healthcare privatization: the same measures proposed by the former government were taken by the new one. 

* Education privatization: quite the contrary. The ones trying to privatize higher education are the USL, headed by the current minister of education, Ecaterina Andronescu.

* The relation Basescu-Boc was the stuff with which the tabloid press, owned by their political adversaries, fed for the last four years. I'm not going to even delve into that.

* His daughter was *elected* to the European Parliament. He doesn't have the power to do such ""appointments"". The ""can't read"" bit is news to me.

* He never tried to stifle protests. In fact the protesters, taking after ""indignados"" and ""occupy"" movements, stayed in the square for a couple of weeks. I think you mistake him for Ion Iliescu, the *former* president and mentor to the current PM, who, in June 1990, indeed called on his working class allies to ""clean""--as they put it--University Square.

* For the last ones you are really scraping the bottom of the barrel, again tabloid press stuff.

Done. I responded to that making two observations which you have thus far failed to respond to:

1) Other people choosing to have children doesn't make me automatically responsible for those children. You are welcome to disagree, but you're going to need to state a good reason.

2) I can (and do) safely and routinely cross the road without waiting for a traffic light to change, or without even being near a traffic light. You can argue this is irresponsible if you'd like to try (again, you'll need reasons beyond mere assertion), but if you try to, you're going to need to address the fact that I have the right to increase the danger I expose myself to if I so choose.

No I don't. For starters, I'm far too young to be using a pension, but when I do get to the age where I use one I have every confidence that the government will no longer be giving me any help with that, thanks to the way things are going in the UK. I shall pay a lifetime of taxation, the fact that other people have children who also pay taxation does not behold me to them or to their children.

&gt;People having children are doing something for society, your behaviour makes their job harder.

I disagree, frankly. They chose to have children in an overpopulated planet, that's not an altruistic act in the slightest. People can have kids if they want, I don't object to that - I do object to their fully individual decision being forced upon me, as if every time a couple choose to have a child I'm automatically a surrogate father to that child.

It is not my job to be a role model to those kids. I never asked for that, I never agreed to it, and I will not be it.

They have parents, that is what they are for.

Pero la bandera roja y amarilla que todos conocemos, si bien se instauró en tiempos borbonicos no tiene nada que ver con el fascismo que existió dos siglos después, el único elemento de la misma que pueda ser ""asociable"" con el franquismo es lo que representa al rey y a la casa real, porque el escudo en si representa a castilla, aragon, leon, navarra y granada, junto a las columnas de hercules y el lema ""plus ultra"" todo ello simbologia con siglos de historia.

Por lo que el hecho de que en la guerra los ""nacionales"" utilizase la bandera en el formato anterior al republicano para diferenciarse de ellos no es motivo suficiente para decir que nuestra bandera viene de ahí ni que tenga nada que ver con el fascismo o franquismo (por cierto representado este con el águila de san juan detrás del escudo en la bandera)

Then yes, it sucks, because those carriages are more overcrowded than deportation carriages to Siberia.

However, I don't think that you're fully grasping why people are skeptical of the EU. They care about democratic principles and their ability to have their voices heard on every single piece of legislation that governs them, and feel that what the EU currently is does not do that. From their perspective, the EU is far too much of an outward influence imposing laws on things that they feel powerless to have a say in. This is a valid criticism.

The EU is not a conceptually flawed idea. Co-operation in the drafting of laws, a unification of parliamentary procedures across countries and minimising inter-European conflicts are all sensible ideas, but they must be carried out correctly. The United Kingdom was the ultimate example of cross-cooperation between countries before the EU came along, after all. It is the execution that is poor (I mean, a European President that we had absolutely no say in electing is abominable), and the resulting unaccountability is what leads to the corruption that the public really fears.

UKIP says that we should bring back the powers to Westminster, but there is another way. Reform and democratise the EU so it is a safe place for those powers to lie, and where they can be more useful to the world. Put the European Parliament at the very top, put MEPs in charge of drafting laws. Make the European President directly elected by the European people or don't have one at all. It's not sovereignty that's important, it's democracy and true accountability.

After the next EU treaty that should make these changes, we should have a referendum, as a matter of judgement of the public. It is the EU's duty to convince Britain to stay, and that can only be achieved through democracy.

In a nutshell, I accept most of UKIP's complaints of the EU, but I do not find its solution to be logical.",0,1341872971,null,0,false,0,c5bosco,t3_w9mi2,t1_c5bosco,t1_c5blxie,null,1429335705,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

From my point of view, I just want the British people to have control over their own laws. It doesn't matter how that comes about, just that it happens. In theory, a properly democratised EU could bring that about.

Bringing it all back to Westminster is the equivalent of hiding ourselves back in our shell, politically speaking. It's important we have that shell, and if Europe refuses to give the British people the say they deserve, then we are perfectly justified in using it, but we must give them one last chance. There needs to be new European constitution (and we should do our best to help write it), and it will go to a referendum. If it is no good, we should reject it and leave the EU until further notice.

In fact, I'd support your demands to be put in the new constitution. Taking up the Euro should play no part in being a member of the EU, and the budget contribution should adhere to the principle of putting in what you get out as close as reasonably possible. I don't see the result as being contrary to the European project at all. It's different, yes, but it's not unrecognisable and still worth defending.

true,koleye,UNSA,American Europhile,"I hear this argument all the time. While it is true that Britain is noticeably different from continental Europe, it is still much closer to it than any of its former colonies and territories. America is very unique among the developed world for many reasons (religiosity, military spending, two-party system. Canada is very similar to the United States in most regards. Australia is physically very far removed from most of the developed world, and has never really been in a position to be a relevant power (whereas Canada's influence is inflated because of its proximity to the United States).

Britain has been a prominent world power for around 500 years. Britain's history as one of the world's leading countries is ingrained into British culture. Forgive me if I doubt that the majority of the British populace is willing to give up their role as an influential country. If they truly were the majority, then Britain would have abandoned those aspirations a long time ago. Yet British politicians from all parties continue to promote Britain as an influential global player. If the majority of the British electorate was okay to just pack up their bags and forget about the rest of the world, their political culture would have shown it by now. It is my belief that the Euroskepticism that permeates Britain's political culture is largely a result of a lingering sense of nationalism that, on the continent, has been gradually dying and supplanted with pan-European identification. This is due to the difference in the wartime experiences between the continent and Britain. Continental Europe emerged from the war physically ruined. Britain emerged as relatively better off, though bankrupt and clearly surpassed in status by the United States and the Soviet Union. The Special Relationship gives the UK an advantage over countries like France, but something that most Brits don't understand is that Americans don't really feel the same away about the relationship. It is one we take for granted. We expect the Brits to always be there and support us, largely without question. It is not a relationship built on parity by any means.

You pretty much have to go to the main square. But don't have great expectations for the Astronomical Clock. The trumpeters at the end were hired because too many visitors were disappointed by the hourly show.

The castle is great, but don't worry about getting the full blown tour of the inside. It's not hugely impressive and you can get inside part of the church for free anyway. (you can even see the Mucha stained glass on the left for free too). The view from the top of the Church tower is quite possibly the best in the city.

Charles Bridge is best experienced late at night or early in the morning. It's really photogenic so it's worth the extra effort to go during ""off"" hours. There are also boat tours that don't require reservations on the east bank that afford nice views of the city and bridges, too.

Prague is nice because it's got really cheap hotels and relatively cheap food and concerts. You can go to the ticket center just to the left of the entrance to the Tyn cathedral and get classical concert tickets there, it's actually cheaper than using their online booking service. You can also find out where there's going to be jazz concerts that night as well. 

Since the food is cheap, we usually splurge for lunch (cheaper than dinner!) and try and go somewhere fancy. 

Petrin Hill and the monastery give you some really nice views of the city too. I really enjoyed the observatory with the old telescopes in the park at the top of the hill as well. 

I've been to a lot of the museums there and can't really say that I was blown away by any of them. The city museum was okay, not excellent.

The fact that Britain is physically removed from the continent has ensured a different path of cultural development. Britain has for a thousand years been relatively safe from the threat of invasion. The rest of continental Europe was not so fortunate. The perpetual destruction the continent faced produced many kingdoms and empires that attempted to subdue their neighbors partly in a bid to produce a lasting peace (under their rule, of course). This failed miserably. Integration and education saved Europe from warfare more than anything else.

true,Bezbojnicul,ROMA,Internetistan,"I think it's a mix of internal and external factors. The historic Turkish-Tatar minority in Romania has always had strong cultural ties with Turkey, so their version of islam is influenced by Turkish attitudes, which are conservative (so is Romania in general) but not fundamentalist. If I'm not mistaken, this minority's imams are schooled in Turkey. They are mostly located in the 2 south-eastern counties (near the Black Sea), and their Grand Mufti is a young and generally ""liberal"" guy.

Now the problem is that recently, the number of Muslims have started to grow somewhat, especially in the bigger cities. This, I think, is mostly Arab immigrants. The problem is that these are stating to gravitate away from the Grand Mufti's authority towards imams schooled in Saudi Arabia, preaching a more hardline (Salafi) version of Islam. This phenomenon is found throughout the Balkans (I'll look up some articles after I get home from work if you're interested). The Grand Mufti even warned about this trend in Romania.

Now, to be honest, I can't really judge attitudes of Muslims in the West for comparison. I had few contacts, and I'm reticent towards forming an opinion based on the way the media portrays them. Also, Romania is conservative in general, so traditional muslim conservativism does not stand out against traditional christian-orthodox traditionalism. But Salafi attitudes will probably start to become more noticeable, as Romania's Muslims will increase, given that we'll slowly turn from a transit coutry into a destination coutry.",0,1341910624,null,0,false,0,c5bwn04,t3_w9oa2,t1_c5bwn04,t1_c5bwiaj,null,1435702383,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Les taux d'intérêt peuvent donc être, même dans une situation d'équilibre, négatifs jusqu'à ce x %.

I know people who have been robbed at the train station as soon as they enter the country (that was a Japanese student, passport gone etc.) There are a huge amount of questionable immigrants and some areas with drug problems. OK not unusual but for example Berlin where I live now I would say is much safer.

It's not so much I disagree but I wouldn't say it's one of the best places to live but it depends on the criteria. Little things like I found it very hard to manage work and doing grocery shopping for example as the shops close at 7pm and half days on saturdays when I was too tired to get up and do my weekly shopping. Everything is closed on Sundays. I know people who complain about Vienna because of this also, it does get annoying.  

Bureacracy is very difficult even for French speakers, there are many complicated laws. Also things don't get done very well like if you call an electrician they are probably cowboys (another bonus for Berlin where the people in those jobs are very good imo).

Well they are minor things I guess but the main issue is if you aren't used to the Swiss way of life from an early age it is hard to adapt. Mainly I just think that these surveys do not have criteria the same as a typical person might.

No, but they get into massive debt. People without the financial backing of their family are less likely to take on the insane amount of debt. 

'Plumbers and others' are less likely to send their children to university now because of the severe debt they are likely to get into. 

Why should they subsidise someone doing art history? Because that is also part of the tapestry that enhances our collective culture.

The burglar who broke into my mother-in-law’s flat in Paris, not expecting her to be there, withdrew with a courteous “Excusez-moi, madame”. An English burglar would have bound and gagged her.

&gt; It helps, of course, that the social problems in France are relegated to the suburbs and cités, where they may safely be ignored until the next riots. In Britain, by contrast, you can’t escape social problems, even when you just pop out for a pint of milk.

The way you can get access to the two differes a little bit. As for Universities you can only get access when you got an 'Abitur' which is also called general higher education entrance qualification(allgemeine Hochschulreife), as where  Fachhochschulen allow entrance to people who got 'only' a specialised higher education entrance qualification. Specialised higher education entrance qualification can be aquired by finishing vocational education with a certain average grade(one example).
From that fact might result the assumption of some people that Fachhochschulen are easier.
 
In general universities are regared as being more theoretic and teaching more theorie than practice/experience.
Fachhochschulen tend to focus more on experience. They for example might teach you how to use a certain programm where at university you would learn the basic process behind the programm. The thought behind that being that once you understand the theorie you can apply it more freely. 
I for one choose to study at a university because i belive knowledge to be more important. But i never attended a Fachhochschule so my views might be a bit biased.

Also there is kind of a different attitude towards learning. At university you would have to structure your own schedule and decide what you want to learn. You have to organize things like access to labs or when you attend an exercise for a lecture on your own and nobody will force you to do anything. 
Fachhochschulen on the other hand are more like school as they organize more for you. For example you might get a fixed timetable and there wont be much you have to do on your own.
This leads to the assumption that university students are more independent because the have to organize more stuff. But it can also lead to examples where people need 10 years to finish a degree. What i am trying to say is that both have their advantages and disadvantages.

As a side note you can get a Bachelor at a Fachhochschule and then go to a University to get your Masters. Which might be important if you want/decide later on to get a Doktor/Phd.",0,1341916127,null,0,1341916682,0,c5bx4qd,t3_w6htv,t1_c5bx4qd,t3_w6htv,null,1429340397,2,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,2

It's not disingenuous at all. I've got 12 grands worth of debt, to me that's pretty massive.

&gt; Frankly, if students are being put off from vastly increasing their earning potential by this then I have to wonder whether they were ever university material in the first place, both in the intelligence stakes and in the lack of commitment that they are showing.

A degree doesn't 'vastly' increase your earning stakes to be fair. Certainly not a BSc.

Also, it's a pity that you've broken down university to being nothing more than a vocational study centre for young Thatcherites. I presume the value of academia is lost on you as well.

Die Wikipedia-Seiten von Personen stehen im Allgemeinen unter recht guter Beobachtung. Unter den Beobachtern ist das gesamte politische Spektrum vertreten, die in aller Regel darum kämpfen dass ""ihre"" Seite nicht als extreme Spinner dasteht. Die [Diskussionsseite](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diskussion:Helmut_Roewer) um den Roewer-Artikel zeigt recht gut, wie möglicherweise wertende Formulierungen rausfliegen oder belegte Fakten drinbleiben.

IMO ist das Unsinn. Auf wen soll ich denn sonst verlinken, wenn derjenige ""neutral"" sein soll? Irgendwelche Tageszeitungen (oder deren Autoren) haben eine politische Tendenz, Aktivisten und freie Publizisten auch.

A complicated example - the media coverage of the racism there was pretty dire, not because they missed it, but because they found it was there in some circumstances and failed to realise that it wouldn't be there in all circumstances.

As you say though, it's true that stats and anecdote are hard to reconcile and that stats are hard to normalise. I mean, say a place has 10 murders per million people/year, does that make it more or less safe than a place with no murders per million people/year but 2000 armed robberies per million people/year? Hard to equivocate different forms of crime, essentially one needs to score them, but then scores would vary.

•Le Centre Ville. From the Grand' Place to the Place de la République, go down the busy ""Rue de Béthune"". Classic restaurant: ""Aux Moules"", ideal for eating mussels while enjoying a beer.

•'Gare Saint-Sauveur'. An ancient station which has become an exhibition center for modern art. Cool bar there, too.

•La Citadelle. A great park where people go to visit the zoo, picnic, to run...

•For nightlife, head to Masséna / Solferino. No need to explain, you'll see by yourself. My favorite bars if you like beer on tap: Mac Ewan's, Van House, O'Scotland, Au Fut et à Mesure. A few decent restaurants too

If you get bored, I would recommend the 'Grand Boulevard', north-east of Lille. Take the tram or rent a bike and head to Roubaix or Tourcoing and enjoy the 1900' architecture, the parks. The Parc Barbieux and its surroundings are really interesting.

True dat, but I wasn't even talking about that. I was talking about the outright rivalry in Africa and Asia. They don't have opposite or competing views, but they compete with each other trying to further their perceived national interest.

And maybe they are slowly growing up. Things can always change. Though I have not seen two former superpowers ever entering a meaningful alliance. Just look at Portugal and Spain. They lost their superpower status about 100 to 150 years before France and England. And while they are cooperating, like England and France are on a limited basis, they are not working together for common goals. There is a US global security strategy. And China is slowly forming their global security strategy. And there is cooperation. For example between England and the US. Which is, in reality, much closer than the cooperation between France and England. 

I doubt England and France will be having anything meaningful in a commen global security strategy before China is stationing their blue water navy in the Indian ocean and beyond. And even then, they will bicker as always and go behind each others back trying to please the US (England) to get a better deal and/or please China (France).

Well, I just finished my bachelor thesis about the EU's actorness in security and defence affairs denying that something like that has been achieved yet, so I don't think your generalization is really applicable to what I said - which, to clarify, was not that we have a common foreign policy, but rather, that positive signs of increased security/defence cooperation are visible. What the future will bring is beyond such an observation though.

I found that in France the language barrier isn't as bad if you are relatively young, around 18-26 as most young French people really want to practice their English on you. It's a great way to get invites to parties. I would recommend checking the couchsurfing community of the city you will be visiting. They normally have meet ups planned most weekends, and most days in big cities. It's a great way to get free accommodation and also meet lots of people in the process. Rural France is beautiful, but when I say rural, I mean *rural*. If you go into the countryside make sure you do lots of planning beforehand, especially with coach and train times. It's very easy to get stuck. Just as a tip, with the exception of Paris, the southern cities tend to be the most Anglo friendly. But I'm assuming you'll be taking a northern route into Germany?

You'll have a much more familiar experience in Germany. Pretty much everyone will speak English, and even when they say they can't they can still get by. As you are only going for a short trip you will probably find the Germans more approachable than the French. Not that I have anything against the French, it just takes a bit longer to assimilate there. Germans are actually some of my favourite people in Europe. Make sure you get used to drinking lots of beer before you go ;)

The video is woefully oversimplified, and putting aside it finishes on a biblical note and that's no place to go to source morality, it suggests the following solutions:

&gt;The Federal Government has the power and duty to create our money system with no interest and no debt.

And single handedly destroy upward mobility.  There's a very good reason why people are willing to pay interest and take on debt, they borrow to invest in themselves.  To create.

Why isn't it done by governments?  Because they outsource projects and put contracts up for tenure.   Where they go isn't a problem with the monetary system.

&gt;Private banks will be branches of the restored Commonwealth Bank.

Well the video's about Australia, but if a European country made all the branches of every bank glorified accountants of the central bank it would be an act of war as we live in a global economy.

&gt;Interest outlawed to conform with Bible principles.

If I've got money I'm sure as hell not going to lend it out to someone else if the money isn't going to be working for me.  Interest is a way to put mattress money back into circulation.  If I don't have any money but want to start up a business I can spend 10 years cobbling together the necessary start up funds and then go about setting up my business proper, or I can go to someone with mattress money, agree to interest, set up my business in year one and pay off the debt by year 5.

It combats this with, 

        ""potential profit sharing in legitimate ventures is not interest""

Wait, so I set up a business, work 80+ hours week, build up a respectable large business creating something orders of magnitude greater than what I started off with, and the guy that I borrowed the original start up money owns part of the whole?

NO DEAL.

I'll take the interest option on the business loan or on the mortgage repayments thanks.

&gt;With the proper money system in place there will be no inflation.

Inflation can be a good thing. 

&gt;Money is created as a debt, it can be created as a credit.

Y'ay.  Free credit.  Can't see any problems there.  We could also make leaves official banknotes.  Take a walk in the forest and all your money problems are solved!!!

It's created as a debt so as to not destroy the currency.  It's a debt because you pay debts back.

Debt as of itself is neither a good thing or a bad thing.  Same goes for interest.  It simply depends on the nature of the debt.

The video chooses to identify only one side of the issue.  Debt isn't forced on anybody.  Governments and taxes are but people accept this under democracy.  Debt isn't.  There's a very good reason why people willingly take on debt early on and pay it off over their lifetime - they want the stuff early on so they can use it, not only to be able to afford it when they're closest to the grave.",0,1341925742,null,0,false,0,c5by79q,t3_wad1w,t1_c5by79q,t3_wad1w,null,1429340638,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

As another example, NYC is actually extremely safe for most people. As long as you don't go to the Bronx and certain other areas for example (and generally they're far enough from the places you want to go that you wouldn't accidentally wander there), there is very little to be worried about.

Nature of the crime is important too.

Une photo, que ce soit une photo classique ou un panneau, est bonne quand elle raconte une histoire. C'est l'histoire qu'elle raconte plutôt que la splendeur d'un panorama, qui provoque une emotion. Et un panoramique n'échappe pas à la règle. Il faut parfois décentrer un panoramique trop évident pour replacer à un endroit important une bribe qui peut accueillir une scène. Shooter son pano, et attendre la scene à l'endroit choisi : un oiseau, un enfant, une personne qui fait quelque chose, sa copine en culotte... bref, un premier plan narratif. C'est lui qui fera briller ton panoramique. Qui en fera une photo d'exception.

true,chiniwini,ESPA,Spain,"I think the fact that US citizens have the right to carry arms has little (or, better said, not as much as you may think) effect on the violence rates. I personally think it is more related to things such as poverty, ""the war on drugs"", racism, etc. USA is *way* more poor than what many people think.

As someone posted below, Switzerland also recognizes the right to carry arms, and it's violence rates are ridiculous.

Also, it's important to note that one of the reasons of the right to carry arms is to be able to defend yourself against a corrupt government. So I think such a right is somehow necessary.

&gt; One aspect of the gun control debate is the conflict between gun control laws and the right to rebel against unjust governments. Blackstone in his Commentaries alluded to this right to rebel as the natural right of resistance and self preservation, to be used only as a last resort, exercisable when ""the sanctions of society and laws are found insufficient to restrain the violence of oppression"".

It was something like 80th, and it was because 40% or so said that they were unhappy. What they found out was that another third reported 'Don't Know'. 

The conclusion after was that asking people what they think about their situation isn't always the best. This is more true of the Balkans, since they are more than eager to complain and downgrade their situation.

Of course this doesn't mean it's not pretty safe to still go there. Even in New Orleans, which had 199 homicides in 2011 at a population of only 344,000, you'd have to stay 1,200 years until the odds would turn against you.

The city with the highest crime rate is Berlin, with a population of 3.5 million, 156 victims, which is still slightly below the homicide rate of the whole of the US. The safest city in the US is Lincoln, Nebraska, which in turn has about the same homicide rate as Germany.  
To compare that to the 1,200 year figure from earlier, it takes more than 15,000 years to fall victim to a homicide in Berlin on average, or even 85,000 years for the entire country.

I disagree but this is not the point of our discussion.

&gt; It really should have been introduced in a more cautious, piecemeal fashion so the kinks could have been ironed out without causing so much suffering. It needs to be dealt with now but the pain any solution will cause will be great.

I come the same conclusions but far from wishing I think a much bolder approach would have been better. We lost the last ten years not correcting the obvious pain points and now we have to rush everything.

&gt; The social rights aren't really an issue at all due to the ECHR

Well it seems to be an issue for the UK since it always block any attempt to integrate in this area. If it hadn't been for Tony Blair, the UK would even have complete opt-out on this chapter. And now the UK is even pushing for reforms of the ECHR.

&gt; the market will sort out fiscal 'distortions' (most commonly called such by rich countries afraid that the poorer members will undercut them with competitive tax regimes)

I was actually thinking more of the case of Ireland with its corporate tax. HP, Dell, Google, Amazon or Microsoft have headquartered there while enjoy the common market but contributing close to nothing in the country where most of their consumers are. I'm rather pro-market but it did not correct itself in the past 15 years.

&gt; Also the EU does do a great job in this area sometimes, especially looking out for consumer rights issues and like roaming charges for mobile phones. I'll admit that the UK does drag its feet about Environmental regulation, but quite often these are proposed as protectionist measures rather than genuine fear of damage.

Agreed.

&gt; Well the EU expanded and took in 10 new members not long ago, the UK was the major country pushing that diplomatically.

The way the UK welcomed new eastern european members should indeed have been an example to the rest of Europe.

&gt; There's no real political benefit to UK tooting its horn when it achieves something in the EU so you don't hear about it when it happens.

http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=Canada&amp;country2=Germany&amp;city1=Saint+John%27s&amp;city2=Munich

The rent varies very wildly here. Depending on location, our public transit isn't great. There is a high end 2 apartment down the road from where I live for 2000 euro with all utilities, internet, etc included (similar listing just a little farther away for 1300 euro, but no utilities). That would be city centre (95sqm) and a 3 bed room townhouse with garage (), all included and furnished for about 2400 euro. 

When you leave the city centre you usually can get a 2 or 3 bedroom house for 1200 euro, and 1 or 2 bedroom apartments in the 400 to 900 euro range, these wont include any utilities, and depending if it is electric or oil heat these your utilities can vary greatly. 

Canada vs Munich in general seems fairly similiar. So I am not in for a huge shock from that direction. 

Here is another question. Using these listing sites, they list commission, is that something the renter has to pay the agent for renting this apartment? That seems so strange to me. Here it is either a private rental or a company manages the property (acts as the landlord for the owner) and a percentage of the rent you pay it paid to the company.

true,naughty,null,null,"Well the FTT is a great example of what annoys the UK about the EU. It's pure politics with both empirical evidence and theory against it. We point this out and we get called anti-EU and obstructionist for not agreeing to stupid things.

The Euro may have worked with a bolder approach but again the practicalities took a back seat to politics. Take the fiscal treaty for example. Germany broke the rules but is doing well, Spain and Ireland didn't and have had problems (made far worse by the low interest rates of the ECB prior to 2008). There has been no realistic plan for the Eurozone's fiscal policy so far and the clock is ticking and people's lives are being ruined.

There's no need for integration on social issues due to the European Convention on Human Rights (another thing the UK had great influence on and should be more proud of). The issue the UK government has with the ECHR court is that we can't just ignore it like the French and others do when it suits them. Also whether prisoners can vote isn't really worth the courts time. It does get a very bad press in the UK though, even though it's helped our media avoid government censorship, the irony!

Ireland's corporation tax is Ireland's business not ours. If Ireland was being used to launder money or other illegal activities then we'd have a reason to complain. Do you also have an issue with the Dutch authorities for allowing the [Dutch Sandwich](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Irish_arrangement)? Also if Ireland is fair game for it's corporation tax then Germany is fair game for the Haartz reforms which can be seen as 'beggar thy neighbour' policies, i.e. they increased German competitiveness relative to the EU. Where do you draw the line?

Well I'd agree it would help the UK's image in Europe if we did boast a little but the truth is we're an easy target being the biggest pro-Trade, anti-Bureaucracy country and probably always will be.

""Does the Earth go around the Sun, or does the Sun go around the Earth?"" This is also a little bit tricky: as someone pointed out before they revolve around their center of gravity (which in the system Earth-Sun is close to the center of the Sun but if I recall correctly in the system Jupiter-Sun it is outside the Sun).

It’s funny that the people who now overthrow president Băsescu, rightfully blaming his own disregard for proper democratic behavior, do exactly as Băsescu did at his worst, except on a grander scale and with their own special blend of cynicism.

Having the support of the parliament, which they have gained not as a result of elections, but as a result of opportunistic defections, does not automatically render their decisions democratic and legal.

They explain that they just want to remove the hurdles in order to make the country easier to govern. Well, democracy is not an institutional design that aims to make things easy for the people in power. Instead, it’s meant to keep them in check. When a bunch of politicians like these take advantage of the people’s frustration with the previous government and just run wild, taking hold of every institution or law that might stand in their way, it’s not exactly reassuring.

But let's say it's true. Let's say it is not because the **Constitutional **Court has no say when it comes to the internal rules of the Parliament. The decisions affected by the order issued by the Government are the 2 appointments of the chiefs of Senate and the other Parliament room. The Court will have the chance so have its say on these, but the precedence is that when the majority changes in the Parliament, so do the 2 room chiefs. It's happened countless times before and it's not against any of the internal rules of the Parliament.

Take the example of Geoana. He has indeed dismissed by his own party, but in his place came a member of a different party. Why? because the majority had changed. It's that simple.

About the trip to Bruxelles (which btw, does not really constitute a coup d'etat), the Prime Minister acted on behalf of the Parliament's decision. The Constitutional Court had only a consultative authority, not a decisive one.

&gt; The Government issued an emergency decree changing the number of votes it takes to dismiss the President with only 3 weeks before the referendum.

That's because, at that point, because of a law put in place a few months before by the president's party, the president was basically impossible to dismiss. 9 million+ people had to vote for his dismissal, which is absolutely ridiculous, considering he was voted in with 5 million votes and the presence at our elections is usually around 9 - 10 millions, at best.

The emergency lies in the fact that a cohabitation with this man, if you're not from his party, is impossible. He has shown this countless times, without any subtlety.

Tu te dis alors : mais il n'y a aucun intérêt pour les créanciers ?!

Si. 

Les investisseurs dont on parle ne sont pas comme toi et moi. Ils n'ont pas leurs économies de bas-de-laine à investir, mais la somme de milliers, de centaines de milliers ou de millions de petits fonds rassemblés dans d'immenses stocks financiers. Ces investisseurs doivent répartir dans de nombreux investissements l'ensemble de tout ce fric.

La règle la plus basique et ultime de la finance est : plus c'est risqué, plus ça risque de rapporter (taux d'intérêt élevé). A contrario, moins c'est risqué, plus le taux d'intérêt sera bas.

Lorsque les investisseurs doivent placer leur argent, ils ne le font pas que sur des activités qui peuvent rapporter gros mais qui sont risquées. Si elles sont risquées, cela signifie qu'ils pourraient tout perdre sur une partie de ces investissements (tu peux imaginer l'inconvénient de voir disparaître quelques millions d'euros...!). Ils placent donc une partie de leur argent dans des placements très sûrs. Ils rapportent peu, mais au moins, cela permet de sécuriser une partie de leur argent.

Lorsque c'est la panique sur les marchés, un placement comme la dette française peut sembler tellement sûr que les investisseurs ""se battent"" pour y caser leur argent. Les taux diminuent... diminuent... diminuent... puis passent en négatif.
