Correction.
People hundreds of years ago invaded the divided country of Ireland and pillaged the country, stripped its people of rights, forced them into a unitary state and ""told them to pay for famine relief entirely ourselves."" (this last bit is quite sensationalist considering the complex issues of the time).
This happened, hundreds of years ago. The English don't hate the Normans who came and oppressed the Anglo-Saxons (who also, when they invaded Roman Britain oppressed the local populace) which happened hundreds of years. 
I live in Northern Ireland so I know the political troubles the isles has had to deal with first hand. The day you realise that you shouldn't judge human beings by the actions of human beings from hundreds of years ago, is a day everyone should look forward to.

Someone wrote on the ""Lucas Moura signs for PSG"", ""It sort of shocks me how reserved you are [psg fans] about all your signings."" This documentary pretty much says why.

Am I happy that we have great players nowdays? Sure. Am I happy to finally hear the Champions League anthem for my team again? Absolutely. Would I trade all those new signings and a chance to play in the CL to get our ultras back (and maybe Pauleta :) )? In an instant.

Last year I was happy to see Menez, Gameiro, Bisevac sign for Paris...this year with Ibra, Lavezzi, Silva, I should go crazy but to be honest I'm indifferent about it. I just don't recognize the team anymore. It's weird but I was way more excited about signing Hoarau from Le Havre than all of those.

Seeing those two pictures [1](http://i.imgur.com/5CRv0.jpg) [2](http://i.imgur.com/S9UYX.jpg) recently brought a little hope that maybe Nasser might be a fan and wants to see the ultras back but...I doubt it.

Anyway, it's kinda hard to really write exactly how I feel. It's such a weird time, we are buying the world's best players and deep down I want to go back to the way things were.

I'll always support PSG, I've never supported anyone else but like the documentary says, it's not the same PSG. Nowadays it's football business all the way.

I gave you a simple example about the Maastricht treaty: the pillars system. Do you see EU having this system now? No. Why? Because we're done with the Maastricht treaty.

Your finance minister might say whatever he likes, for domestic consumption, but the reality is that since the ratification of the Maastricht treaty, there are other texts that amended and superseded it. Some provisions from the Maastrich treaty and older texts are maintained, but the Maastricht treaty is not EU's document of reference.

As for the ""country X pays country Y's debt"" argument, it is a fallacy. Estonia and Bulgaria received billions of euros from the EU budget. An equally fallacious argument would be to ask you why Cyprus, which is one of the smaller countries, but a net contributor, had to pay for Estonia. See where this is going? Nevertheless, Bulgaria is not even a Eurozone member. Estonia did not participate in the first loan to Greece (not in the Eurozone back then). In the second loan, the amount was less that the money it received from the EU budget. Let me stress something: a loan is a loan, not a gift.

Debt mutualization won't work the way you're thinking it will. Nobody will steal Estonian or Bulgarian money. EU's new and old central institutions, having more powers, will be able to guarantee for the EU as a whole.

I really like BBC, much because of the high quality documentaries with the legendary David Attenbourough, but also other in-depth documentaries. I also like some of your journalists like Pilger.

**The People**: Most Englishmen I've met has been quite humble and nice. 

I remember one time when I was on a weekend trip alone to London for a health issue, I stayed at a hotel in Kensington, and on the way home one night I got stopped by 3 random British people, all different age but they just sat outside at 21-22 a clock and talked. They were genuinly interested in what I was doing in London and I stopped to talk for a while which was nice. 

I also remember from the same trip, missing 1 penny for a cab which I thought was embaressing, so I humbly asked an older British couple for it and they smiled and happily gave me a penny. They also genuinly talked to me about what I was doing in England by myself, which, again, felt nice.

The exception to this is the occasional drunken British tourist abroad, which I can both personally attest to sometimes being pretty obnoxious and which apparantly got the honor of the [worlds worst tourist](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-mandel/worlds-worst-tourists-bri_b_857011.html).

true,Nederbird,SWED,Sweden,"From what I can understand of it, the main issue with integrating Roma seems to be that those who're not already integrated (because believe, there are) live in communities with a strong sense of collective identity and an ingrained code of honour, kind of how I imagine Pashtun society to work: Everybody of the community lives for the community, everybody in it supports their fellow member whatever happens without exception and the actions of one man are taken to reflect upon the community as a whole. In essence, do something the community thinks is bad, stop it or your fucked, but do something only the outside thinks is bad, not our problem and we'll protect you if they come after you. Above all this, most importantly, is that it's difficult to break away from this, that if you try to break away from it you'll either just be pulled right back by it or your get cast out from it. That's the picture I've gotten.

What has reinforced this impression of mine are the stories I've heard. Like the one about a kid who went to school, but whose dad kept him away from it because ""it won't make you amount to anything anyway"". Or about the man who became a doctor and was consequently exiled from his community because ""taking care of people and changing diapers is a woman's job"" and having their man do it sullied their honour, so when he said he wouldn't stop, they cut him off. Or about the woman who married a man from the outside, who couldn't tell her family to not come visiting (and eat up everything they had in the process), as for a woman and a younger member of the family, she was in no position to do so (well, either that or risk getting disowned). In all cases, it's about their own community keeping them back or causing trouble for them. You do what the community says, or get cut off, and despite what one might say, I don't think that most people have the strength to face that option, especially not when they're already disliked by the ""outside"" from the start. Therefore, even if they wanted to integrate, they can't, because they don't want to risk losing their family, friend, and pretty much everybody and the only people they've ever known.

Another thing that gives me this idea are the examples of Roma who actually HAVE integrated and whose integration actually is/has been noticed on account of its benefits. There are communities of Roma who, both in past and present, have taken on certain trades and lived with those for generations. They've been miners, basket weavers, musicians, tinkers, carvers etc./whatever, who have been recognized and appreciated for their roles, and who for that those reasons have had low instances of crime because they already have an occupation. Give a man a job and he (most probably) won't turn to crime. 

They essentially work at a community level, whether it be village, family, clan, tribe, caste or whatnot, and where individual action is most likely frowned upon unless approved by the community. Give the community a job at it will most likely be content with that, it worked in Communist Hungary (as in Communisn, everybody gets a job) for the most part, at least from what I've been told, with major problems starting again after the Fall of the Wall and the subsequent restructuring and layoffs. Problem is, in a society where everybody is expected to go look for and find things for themselves and, above all, to work for themselves, that doesn't work. Unless there is someway to break that family/community/social structure of lower class Roma communities, the situation most likely won't change. And thus, we're stuck where we are.

To say however, that they face no discrimination, is an equally big lie as saying that they, as a group, are perfectly innocent. Most minorities in most countries (or should I dare say, in EVERY country), face discrimination to one or another degree, and I would be VERY surprised indeed to know that the Roma, of all peoples, with their reputation, would not face any sort of discrimination whatsoever. It certainly isn't the only factor, it may not even be one of the main factors, but it's definitely a contributing factor to the Roma people being where they are now.",0,1344542325,null,0,false,0,c5qof09,t3_xxyeh,t1_c5qof09,t1_c5qn3aa,null,1429595768,14,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,14

true,Nederbird,SWED,Sweden,"I would imagine a sort of NGO that would help Roma outcasts who've been disowned from their families integrate into society. Like, educate and coach them on how to behave in different situations and at work and that could evaluate and grade their perfomance and progress. An organization that would build contacts with companies and employers where they could place members as interns for short periods of time so they could learn a few trades, and then guide them to getting a real job and living self-sufficient lives. It'd also double as an place where they would get support in dealing with getting cut off from their communities and where they could seek shelter from other members of their old communities who might perhaps want to hurt them. I believe similar things have existed before in other places, even I can't name any, and in any case, I believe that any such thing would serve as a reassuring factor for Roma who're considering integration in whatever form against the wishes of their communities.

Another alternative might be coming up with solutions culturally appropriate for collectivized Roma groups, such as have them try and start a business, run by family or clan or however they're grouped/organized. I'm not saying that it'd be easy, but it's not impossible. There have been examples of productively integrated Roma communities before, in which as long as they've had a common occupation, there had been no problems.

When I left the industry around 5 years ago one thing we developed was software which would use known camera positions and facial matching to track individual shoppers around a store and generate a map of the route they took, this would then be logged when they used their store card at the checkout and be cross-matched against the stuff they bought to see which promotions and displays had the most effect (on a macro scale).

Tescos were our main client, although I'm sure most large supermarkets now use similar systems.

It was quite interesting stuff to work on (and also kinda creepy being able to watch a screen automatically track a single person as they moved around the store).

Something we'd just started working on when I left was emotion tracking. To attempt to monitor people's reactions &amp; emotions as they moved around the place. While it was the supermarkets funding the development of this the police also expressed a massive interest.

Honestly? I don't like the Brits. Every time I try to like them, I fail. The reasons date back to WW I when my great-grandpa was ""saved"" by the Brits on the Solun front. He said that the conditions in which they were kept in in Britain was no better than a concentration camp. He said ""the Brits would see us picking up the leftover smokes from the ground and finishing them, so they started stepping on them so hard so that we couldn't smoke it"". 

Fast forward to the recent times. Britain is one of the few countries in Europe that require a visa for me to travel there, and it's a really expensive one. Even Canada and the USA are thinking of abolishing visa for Serbs. 

Whenever I meet British people I'm astounded by the fact at how much drunk they can get. This is unbelievable. This usually happens at the beach or at some other touristy place. For example, last year I was walking downtown Amsterdam around 8 PM. Everyone was acting normally, people in general were nice. Then comes a group of very loud people pushing people around, yelling, and being overall jerks. A dutch guy walking with me said ""these guys must be Brits"". They were.

This Summer in Greece, on the beach, there were parties and all, but the Brits were the only ones running around naked, vomitting all over the beach, and being plain rude and, again, loud.

When NATO bombed my country 13 years ago (and without getting into reasons etc.), the Brits were the first to send the planes (along with the Dutch). The Brits were also the only ones who argued for an open invasion of the then-Yugoslavia and crushing it.

Last year when I was leaving for the US, my flight was Belgrade - London - Seattle. I travel to the US and back 4 times a year and have never had any problems (with the security and all). I arrive at Heathrow and mind you, I barely found my gate (the lady at the counter said that my plane lands on ""gates 21 to 44"", I'm not even joking, but okay meh this happens). At the gate, the lady asked me to go through ""final security checkpoint"". This ""check point"" was a room in which I was alone and strip-searched. They looked through all the items in my backpack and asked what the every single item was (like the laptop, headphones, etc). Now before I left, my father gave me this notebook that he had made 10 or so years ago. When she swiped all the items in my backpack, that somehow triggered the ""explosive alarm"". Long story short, 45 minutes later and almost missing my flight, I was let go but not before the director of the airport security came.

The Brits I did meet looked down on me as if I was part of some lower race. They kept bringing up the fact how Britain is an Empire (this is the problem some Serbs have too). I think they still lived in an illusion that half of the world is theirs. Britain is the country that lost the most of the territory in the last 100 years than any other country. 

Interestingly enough, hanging out with some exchange students at my Uni in the US (6 of us: Serb (me), Dutch, Scottish, Italian, 2 French). I asked all of them ""which country do you dislike the most in Europe?"", they *all* said Britain. We did not get into discussion why.

Then the EU thing. Are you, or are you not in the EU? It seems like most of the EU hate comes from the UK. You also choose to be in it, but you make ""exceptions"" for yourselves all the freaking time. It feels like Britain is not even part of Europe at all, much less the EU.

Then add the police state things to it. But that's the stuff I hear on the news. The number of CCTVs, then this fiasco about the olympics (the military being called in, etc).

tl;dr It's simply that whenever I try to have a positive experience with the British people or the Brits, I fail because something prevents me.

1)The treaty of maastricht has since been superseded and it is no longer in play

2)The treaty of Lisbon, while forming the principles of the EU, was never created or accepted inside the EU, using the EP.

2)All international treaties are usually brought in front of parliament of the nations implementing them, this is nothing new, nor special

3)What makes an international treaty different than a contract or a law, is that it cannot be brought forth to a higher authority,since there is none. This applies to the treaty you keep mentioning. 

4)So a treaty is not a law and it only works as long as it is convenient for everybody. That specific treaty is both outdated and inconvenient,and there is no higher authority to impose it, there is not even anyone willing to score political outrage by claiming it, so it is null

I'm not sure if the whole saga is a result of the language barrier, because I've already gave you a simple example about the treaty in question (pillars). Let me try once more. New EU treaties maintain provisions of older EU treaties, but they also amend and modify them. You can't say that a provision in a newer treaty, or a future amendment to the latest treaty we have now, violates some imaginary law, because such provision did not exist in a past treaty. This is what I'm saying in my past comments, but it seems that you don't understand that. We now have only one (1) treaty, not multiple coexisting treaties with contradicting provisions.

It is perfectly [legal to assist a member state in times of need](http://blogs.ft.com/brusselsblog/2010/01/eu-possesses-the-legal-power-to-rescue-greece-if-necessary/). It's right there, in EU's ratified texts. It doesn't matter how you'll name it (shifting debt? loan? bailout?), but it's there.

&gt; You are making a mistake by assuming that the EU is the same thing as the EZ.

It would be pointless to say that I'm academically equipped to understand the difference (hey, I'm on the internet, I could be a dog). Nevertheless, you did not understand my argument. You were asking why some small poor states should pay for the reckless lifestyle of others. I've described how this is not the case, pointing out that it would be equally fallacious to say that some of the others funded the lifestyles of the aforementioned states.

The chain's holy grail for loss prevention was to have a system where they could click on a person on a CCTV screen and on a separate screen they'd get a reasonably accurate map of the route that person has taken since they entered the store (people who nick stuff tend to go straight for the thing they intend to pinch, not wander around shopping first).

This was pretty much doable 5 years ago, although only a couple of newer stores had something similar, and it was only on a trial basis at the time (and wasn't particularly reliable).

After this was implemented and working reliably the next step was to use machine learning to figure out, via routes taken and speed through the store, the difference between legit shoppers and people who were just out to steal shit, then automatically flag suspicious behavior to security staff.

As I mentioned in the linked post, we'd also started looking at monitoring customers emotions and facial expressions, although this was a totally new field at the time and no-one had even attempted it on a large scale.

I left the industry a few years ago, but they were definitely exciting times when I was developing this kind of stuff.

Today was a mixed bag. If you are honest about what's happening, ie, you're a hapless foreigner, they will have a heart. The first time I ordered something (this morning) I was grinning because of the silliness of not being able to communicate anything, and the person I spoke to couldn't help but grin also. Then, moments later, somebody else helped me and this caught me by surprise, having to start over with someone new, and my expression became more serious, and so did his. As things went on and he had to explain to me that he would come over and bring me my espresso and croissant, he seemed a bit annoyed.

So I noticed right away that it's more about how I feel, that this will be reflected back to me. 

Later on today I was at another cafe (at this one the man working there was astonishingly warm and smiley!), I was out front smoking hand rolled cigarettes, when a Parisian hopped off his bicycle looking very serious and spouting completely incomprehensible French, and very quickly. I start off in this way when this happens: ""uhhhh"" I say, as I plan out my next move. ""Parlevous Anglais?"" I ask. No, he says. Uh oh, I think! So here we both go, trying to understand each other. He is asking me for something, and after a while I realised he wants a cigarette. He seems very much in a hurry and he is shaking his head and rolling his eyes. I felt very stupid and I just wanted him to go away, he was making me feel bad and I was trying my best to be helpful and friendly. He kept saying papiers, while I started to roll him a cigarette, which means rolling papers, he wanted 2 of the rolling papers he said, and it made him even more annoyed that I didn't know what he meant.

Finally I gave him 2 and he left, saying ""merci"". I couldn't remember what how to say you're welcome, and I wanted to be polite and make things better so I said merci, too, which he seemed to take the wrong way, shaking his head again and scowling a bit as he rode off on the sidewalk.

I was shaken up after that, but then when I went inside to pay my bill, that same smiley, warm man was there, and he could see I was so fragile and hapless, and he gave me my change with even more warmth, and gave me a wink, too! Wonderful man.

I have lived in a rural area and near the central part of a very major British town.

In the rural area, the nearest government owned cameras are on the nearby dual carriageway. The Highways Agency empathically makes it clear that their roadside cameras are not speed cameras, are not ANPR cameras (well, they are, but crucially they only record and store anonymised data for measurement), and are just used to be able to determine traffic flows.

In the urban area, there are of course council owned/run cameras, but these mostly seem to be on the roads and in the major shopping areas/high street. I can't see any cameras on the street I live in, *however* further up the road is the ""border"" with the next district and there is an ANPR setup operated by the police to record cars entering/exiting the town (this is made clear on a sign near the camera).

true,thelittlebig,EURO,European Union,"Just a little extra info: 

Whatever country your English classes focused on most, even what English (BE or AE most often) you were taught can in some states be decided by the teacher before Abitur relevant classes.  

If you look up the Bildungsplan (edit: Unterpunkt; Interkulturelle Kompetenz) for English in Baden Württemberg for example you will see that it gives much freedom to the teachers.  
But another fact is, that most older teachers still did their exchange years and semesters abroad in the UK. Therefore they are more likely to teach about what they know.  
This is changing as the majority of exchange students these days go to the States, some even to NZ and Australia. Therefore the focus on BE is likely to become lower in the near future.  

My personal school biography pays tribute to this:

First three English teachers used BE and were all older. We joked that our teacher in 7th and 8th grade had witnessed the murder of Caesar herself. (Elementary school, Orientierungsstufe and Gymnasium 7-8)

After that we had two younger teachers in English, that taught AE and more American culture. In the Abitur India was also a topic (I believe the material is called: One language many voices) and included writers such as Salman Rushdie.  

And I got my Abitur in Lower Saxony which is obviously much closer to the UK than any other part of Germany due to the house of Hannover (British crown since the 18th century), the British occupation zone after WWII, the long presence of British soldiers in lower Saxony during the Cold War and of course our geographical proximity to the Isles.  

To stay a little bit on topic:  
Lower Saxons lovingly call the British ""Inselaffen"" (Island-apes).
We also always joke about the terrible British food, which I find funny since they say the same about us.

Most Americans probably interpret that statement as merely poorly thought out diplomatic politeness, whereas in the UK it seemed to create quite the stir.

But, the concept and general consensus of the special relationship I think is still very strong among Americans. For Americans even without ethnic ties see the UK as the paternal country to the United States, a bond forged through world wars and a common heritage. I'm certain if you polled Americans on our greatest European ally, the response would be overwhelmingly the United Kingdom.

First, while I know there are various groups and sub-groups, the distinction between Rroma and gypsies (in those terms) is one that I have only encountered on reddit. As [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people#Terminology) notes, 'gypsy' is an exonym, i.e. a term not used by the so-called gypsies themselves.  So my questions are:

1) What do the people you call gypsies, call themselves? Can you find the Romanian gypsies in [Wikipedia's list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people#Population_and_subgroups), or are they lumped together with Rroma?

2) Do Rroma and Romanian ""gypsies"" speak the same language? If so, is there possibly some high-caste/low-caste stuff going on, or as they just different ethnic groups?

3) Are some Rroma involved in top-tier organization of gypsy crime and begging, or are they totally separate?

4) What do you think happened [here](http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tv2.no%2Fnyheter%2Finnenriks%2Fher-faar-sigoeynerkongen-karoli-romfolksjokk-3834032.html&amp;act=url)? The story: Renée Karoli is a self-proclaimed Norwegian ""gypsy king"" who in your terminology would probably be Rroma, though he's fairly dark-skinned. He's the kind who brags that a ""true gypsy"" steals but would never beg, and so on. Last month he was raising hell about Norwegian authorities' ""Nazi-like treatment"" (read: lack of pampering) of a Romanian gypsy encampment. Then on visiting the camp, he was all ""sorry, never mind, forget everything I said. These people do not speak our language, they are not gypsies and I don't give a shit about them."" Had he discovered that they were gypsies (in your terminology) instead of Rroma?

Usually foreigners can hit jobs working as bartenders/waiters in campo de fiori and the surrounding area pubs and locals. There's a shitload of tourists there everyday, so they usually hire people with good language skills. Don't expect wonderful wages tho. 

You could also try giving english lessons to kids after school, Italian kids usually suck at english and often need private afternoon lessons. Start spreding the thing with your neighbours in the block of flats you're gonna stay, be always smily and nice to italian mammas/nonnas... if you have a good reputation they could talk good of you and help you find this kind of jobs, usually this job is like eating cherries, you start with a kid then they introduce you to another kid and so on...

Ihr kommt von der moralisch hohen Schiene, weil langsamer ja immer sicherer bedeutet und die ""Raser"" böse Menschen sind. Arschlöcher wird es immer geben und der Straßenverkehr ist einer der schlechtesten Orte es ""jemanden zu zeigen"" oder jemanden erziehen zu wollen, weil es einfach zu gefährlich ist.

Ich fahr jeden Tag 120km Autobahn zu unterschiedlichen Uhrzeiten, ich glaube also zu wissen wovon ich rede. Wenn mir ein Idiot im Kofferraum hängt, mach ihm bei nächster Gelegenheit Platz, denn ich hab da garkeinen Bock drauf. Wenn ich selbst schnell fahren will, halte ich genügend Sicherheitsabstand ein, und gehe frühzeitig vom Gas, so dass ich meistens gar nicht bremsen muss, wenn ich auf ein langsameres Fahrzeug auflaufe.

Wir haben also festgestellt, das Rücksicht und Umsicht im Straßenverkehr für alle den Tag schöner machen.

Wenn ihr also aus Faulheit und Ignoranz die mittlere oder die linke Spur blockiert, weil ihr exakt mit eurer gewählten Geschwindigkeit fahren müsst und nicht ein bischen schneller oder langsamer fahren könnt um euch vor oder hinter dem Typ rechts von euch einzufinden, dann seid ihr die Arschlöcher die einfach mal auf den Rest der Welt nen Scheiss geben.

Ich hab schon viele Autos gefahren und weiß wie es ist mit ner lahmen Krücke auf der Bahn zu sein, da hat meine keine Lust langsamer zu machen, weils halt echt lang gedauert hat auf 160 zu kommen, aber verflucht nochmal irgendwann wirds mal Zeit. Ich hasse die Idioten ebenso, die dann nicht in der Lage sind ordentlich zu überholen, so dass man auf den nächsten LKW aufläuft und bremsen muss (I'm looking at you Mittelspurschleicher!).

Echt mal. Können wir nicht einfach Freunde sein und jeder einfach den Verkehr um sich herum beobachten und darauf reagieren anstatt wie sone Amöbe zu warten bis man angekommen ist?

The UK and the US are not as culturally similar as people in both countries like to think. The UK is much more similar to continental Europe, despite some major rifts.

The UK can either decide to remain at a distance from Europe and remain fairly subservient to the US, or it can be an integral component of a new European political system.

2. Same ethnic group, same language, although that depends on the country they live in. In Romania I often hear them using a Romanian word every other 20 rromani words.
3. The fact that they are marginalized forces them to live a life of crime. Basically 9 out of 10 does something illegal, tax evasion and begging being most common.
4. I have no clue what's going on. They are all gypsies. Havent read the entire article though.

THE GOOD

- Euroskepticism. I agree with it. Note that it does not mean being against it, just being against too much utopian enthusiasm about a brave new world where nationalism doesn't exist. 

- A vibrant economic culture. People dream about making this, making that, getting there from here, not being content to live and do just like everybody else does. I absolutely love it.

- High salary, low tax, low housing costs due to not putting a social stigma on housesharing. Spending 10% of your take-home income on housing costs sharing a 5-bedroom house and having barbecue in the garden is GREAT.

- Used cars are cheap. Honda Civic VTEC for 3000 quids at 6 years old? Pure awesome. I drove that shit at 120 miles per hour, that is over 190 km and it took it perfectly. 

- Taking speeding easily, as long as you watch out for the gatsos and the stripes you are good and even when not only 60 quids as a fine. I really liked it for I often visited clients at long distances, as in, living Birmingham, client in Glasgow.

THE BAD

- Fuck CCTV. It is not even a police state - my car parked on a CCTV street and the police just shrugged when I reported my rear view mirror was broken off. It is surveillance state without an effective police.

- Holy fuck the food sucks. Not just the restaurants, even the raw materials. Never heard of spices? Marinating steaks in for example in some red pepper, chili and mustard sauce before grilling them? Putting garlic salt and a motherfucker amount of pepper on those chips? Why does everything have to taste so bland? 

- The underclass is horrible and even normal people imitate them. How, just how can a self-respecting person go to a shopping mall in _tracksuits_? Where's the pride?

- Lack of cleanliness. If you cook, kitchens are supposed to be washed up every day. This to me normal, to many Brits not...

- Look, it is OK to get drunk. It is not OK to openly _want_ to get drunk. Have some tact and discreetness... Don't say ""Let's go get pissed up!"" Say ""Let's have a drink or two!"" and then _accidentally_ have fifteen, that is OK. ",0,1344588221,null,0,1344588491,0,c5qz2uw,t3_xxt8n,t1_c5qz2uw,t3_xxt8n,null,1429600860,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

Not to mention that money really isn't the actual problem, it is manifestation of deeper problems in the Greek economy, namely deeply rooted corruption, inefficient and business hostile bureaucracy, lack of competitive advantages in global trade, etc.. In short, if well to do countries are going to start pour money to Greece, then when is that going to end and Greece gets to fix its problems, not to mention on is there any motivation left in Greece to fix the economy for real.

It is easy to blame Germany and other well to do countries, but it is much harder to come up with solutions that really fix things, not just transfer the problem from one place into another. In case of transfer union that means that problems of for example Spain, Greece, Portugal and Ireland are exported into Germany, Finland, Holland, etc... countries were the state has to instantiate savings programs to make sure public finances don't become bad eventually. For example how many years these transfers need to be in place? 5, 10, 15, 20 years?

Y'know people in UK seem to be aware that the UK has given money to Ireland, but in Ireland that's not really in the public conscientiousness. The UK has not given a lot of money to Ireland compared to Euro countries (and I don't think the Ireland has actually drawn down that money yet).

If anything, people think that Germany has given a lot of money to Ireland.

Some of his siblings did the same, his youngest brother did that in Switzerland, for example. Others did not, why? I'm not entirely sure, but some felt an obligation to their to do what they said and couldn't go against it. Hell, I've seen a man who was so controlled by his mother, that now he's ended up as a single man of 60 with no family and no good career to speak of, whereas had it not been for his mother, who guilt tripped him into taking care of her every single day until her death, he could've had a good job in linguistics or translation in Switzerland or the Netherlands, and had a loving wife and children. Why did he forsake all that because his mother told him to (and I mean, this was no ordinary love for your mother, this was extreme)? I don't know, maybe he was weak? Maybe he felt indebted to her in some way? There might be tens of answers to that question, probably best explained by a psychologist, but the fact still stands that there are people like that, who have overly controlling parents whom they can't break away from, and in tight knit collective and/or family communities, that pressure is even greater.

true,Paladin8,GERM,Germany,"I merely answered the question, there was no judgement intended from my end.

The sentiment about being underrepresented has grown over the last years for a number of reasons: The problem isn't that Germans think the EU members should do exactly as Germany did but that those whose politics were contrary (e.g. vast spending instead of getting your stuff in order when the economy was good) now need and **expect** help from those who made these cuts voluntarily. Many people know austerity without stimulus won't help Greece, but some first want satisfaction by seeing them suffer through the same measures we did before things become right again. The damages this causes are accepted because that's what happens when you get to the ER instead of treating your problem while you're still able to. Also its frustrating to see the same pattern happen over and over again without being able to do something about it. Some parts of the EU have degenerated into our ""retarded siblings"" who won't and can't do right until someone forces them to. Seriously, how can the EU's fourth largest economy elect someone like Silvio Berlusconi over and over and over again? If it were ""only"" Italy it would be mildly embarrassing to watch but otherwise entertaining, but this way these were lost years in terms of making Italy more self-sufficient. Since the eastern expansion of the EU we're also mostly alone in our struggle to rebuild East Germany (which was badly hurt by our own politics), so it would be really nice if we didn't have to babysit 10 other countries as well. 

It's not objective, it's a sentiment. It doesn't take into account what the UK contributed, how France originally got this whole thing started and a lot of other things. But it's there, it's growing and I'm pretty sure it will become a problem until 2017, because by then the pro-EU parties might lose public support and  moderate powers (for european integration but not this way) won't be able to step in by that time. I hope this helps understanding how this sentiment came to be.

PS: Austerity wasn't the word I was really looking for. There were cuts in spending but also huge changes in labor law and welfare, moderate tax increases and changes in the military sector (in 2006 we only spent 17 b. € for defense).

true,hellodaisy,null,null,"I just came back from 8 months in Paris--all of your concerns are pretty well-founded and valid, IMO, and they made living in Paris hard and stressful while I was there. Now that I'm home, there's tons I miss, so I don't regret it, but I'm glad you're considering the realities.

Safety: I'm from San Francisco which is a pretty big city and has plenty of crime and homeless people and generally I like to think of myself as a city-girl, but I did feel far less safe as a young, female out alone on the streets of Paris than I ever have in SF or NY. In general, I feel like the attitude towards sexual harassment, etc. in France is lax compared to the US and more victim-shaming (not that the US is perfect). I've had guys flash me on the metro/streets, follow me into my building and harass me, mime (and actually perform) jacking off to me in public. Obviously, this is a broad generalization based on my experience in Paris, you can take it for what it's worth.

French: you will get by. Paris is the most visited city in the world, and while people's english may not be perfect, you will most likely always be able to figure things out pretty easily/ask for help. Also, if you put the effort in, learning French can come quickly if you're in the city. People may not always be their kindest to you, but you're also forcing them to work with you, so I think it's pretty even.

Friends: If all you want is to be friends ""with actual French people"", then its not that hard, but you have to understand that a lot of the people who befriend you will just want to be friends ""with an actual American"" (sorry if I'm being presumptuous here). I didn't really have a problem with this, but other expats I knew who wanted to make French friends and speak French and live out French culture, etc. etc. were pretty upset with French people who made friends with them only to practice English and learn about the US (surprise, they're using you just like you're using them!). Anyway, I had no problem with this because I set it up more like an exchange and had alternating meetings in French/English only so everyone could be happy and get what they wanted. But, if you want real friends, you should probably think of them as individual human beings and not actual French people.


I'm not sure how long/permanent your move is, or if it's just temporary, or what your various reasons for moving are. Here's my two cents: I loved living in Paris for 8 months, it was beautiful and there was so much to do and experience, I still find myself aching to go back to places I visited or didn't get the chance to visit. But what I loved even more was coming home and Paris is not a place I could ever see myself living in permanently, if I didn't have family or a SO to tie me down. Eventually, the beauty of the city wears down and the metro starts to stink, and exorbitantly cost of living wears down on the practical aspects of having a great apartment and eating at all the best places and buying only from brocantes, etc.",0,1344598918,null,0,false,0,c5r06g8,t3_xtcac,t1_c5r06g8,t3_xtcac,null,1429601445,5,false,paris,t5_2qkoi,5

Britain is an island, specifically called Great Britain to differentiate it from Bretagne in France. The British Isles are the islands that surround it, from Wight to Anglesey to Mann to the Shetlands. *They do not include Ireland*, at least not to most people in Ireland. Ireland has been known seperately as Hibernia and Scotia for millenia and nobody referred to it as ""British"" until William of Orange (ironically, Dutch) imposed his rule on us a few centuries ago. Why? Well, because no British people lived there.

The word Britain comes from the name of the people that lived on the island of Britain, the Britons, who spoke Britannic, a language quite like Irish, until the Germans showed up and conquered Britain (not Ireland). Britons lived seperately from the Ivernii and the Scotii (who eventually moved from Ireland to Scotland and gave that place its name).

[Gladiator?](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0172495/) UK (actors, accents and directer), Italian (where it's mainly set), American (actors, money and written by them) or New Zealand with Russel Crow.

 Although i think Batman is better set in the US for a few reasons i dont think (if it were in the UK) it would have to be in the least conventional, dated accent on London ([or would have to be like this either](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nMVWAVrVAw&amp;list=HL1344605274&amp;feature=mh_lolz) :p). I mean even James bond would be a bit wierd with a cockney accent. And to what you said in the last sentence, although it's filmed in New York and the accents are mainly american, it's fictionally set (Gotham City). The Script, Directer and the main actors are mainly British. 

Or are you saying that its acted *as* which matters and not starred *by* which the British do mainly in both films if your not counting the backround actors such as civilians or police officers etc. (Batman and Harry potter).

But the crisis is *now* and right now I don't see the EU becoming suddenly more democratic. So the way to move forward would be to demand a thorough democratisation of the EU and protest every motion to erode democratic control. This means among other things less power to the commission and *more power to the parliament*. This also means that there may be no entity created that is above control by the parliament. Simple.

This is not how any competency came to the parliament in the first place. First would come an agreement about a looser intergovermental system, only then would it get subsumed into the community method.

And I'm not so sure that I'd trust any parliament with overall fiscal discipline of an entity quite completely. Certainly doesn't seem to have worked in many countries both in europe and outside in the last years. Some law-based, bureaucratic procedure the parliament would find hard to dodge should set up a overall fiscal straitjacket around the lawmaker's power here.

EDIT: anyhow, I don't mind their monopoly of initialive that much (though I'd like to see it removed, it doesn't change the situation that much) - rarely does a law pass that doesn't have the backing of the governing majority in a country, and that majority can also elect the government, or commission. And the parliament does have indirect initiative, rarely refused.

What is more realistic anyhow, is to really think through a Eurobond mechanism that avoids creating a moral hazard of the less fiscally disciplined countries abusing it. I think this is quite viable. 

Since the reaction to this crisis showed that sovereign defaults are just too large for the integrated financial sector of europe to handle, and since national bonds risk a chain reaction of markets targeting weakest member by weakest member until the defaults are so large that it can't handle them, then obviously one can't count on the market to discipline the countries in their spending.

Not that it did much of that job in the runup to this crisis anyhow.

So one needs other mechanisms to guarantee each country pays its own, and that each country can't take unwarranted risks. Eurobonds can be a carrot in the good times to uphold some system of budgetary discipline. And withholding access to them a stick so sorely lacking in the stability and growth path. 

And something like the current EU/IMF conditionality can be expanded for situations where countries more than transiently violate the Maastricht  criteria. And obviously I think if one is to avoid transfers, any paneuropean guarantees need to be senior to national means of paying one's debts. I think Finns suggested they should guarantee them first with the value of national property first. And their level per country, outside emergency, could be capped to the Maastricht allowed debt levels, or so. Etc

In short, I think its both more realistic and more effective to consider concrete mechanisms for making debt pooling as safe as possible to the disciplined countries, than to expect full federalisation of europe to happen (at once), while surrendering to the supposed necessity of substantial regional transfers.

One example of 19th century Russification was the replacement of the Ukrainian, Polish, Lithuanian, and Belarusian languages by Russian in those areas, which became part of the Russian Empire after the Partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. It intensified after the 1831 uprising and, in particular, after the January Uprising of 1863.[5] In 1864, the Polish and Belarusian languages were banned in public places; in the 1880s, Polish was banned in schools and on school grounds and offices of Congress Poland. Research and teaching of the Polish language, history or of Catholicism were forbidden. Illiteracy rose as Poles refused to learn Russian. Students were beaten for resisting Russification.

In the Ukraine situation was even worse
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russification_of_Ukraine

In 1720 tsar Peter I of Russia issued a decree, in which he ordered expurgation of all Ukrainian linguistic elements in theological literature printed in Ukrainian typographical establishments [1]. Later Empress Catherine II of Russia issued a secret order to count Vyazemsky, the general-procuror of the Senate, in which she instructed him to institute a program of Russification for the provinces of Ukraine, Livonia and Finland, ""using light-handed methods"" [2]. In the opinion of Vladimir Vernadsky, Muscovy had a long standing policy to absorb Ukraine, and liquidate all basis for the local cultural life already in the 17th century [3].

There are some on your way. I'd suggest [Leipzig](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leipzig) &amp; [Bayreuth](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayreuth), which will be really near to the Autobahn you'll be driving on. If you want to go a bit off-road, there's also [Würzburg](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%C3%BCrzburg), which is a absolutely nice city as well. If I had to just chose one I'd go with Würzburg personally. The city was rebuilt so nicely after it was almost completely destroyed in WWII. I've been there quite a few times and have always had a great time. However, like I said, it's not that close (30 minutes) to the route you guys have (probably) planned.

**German motorways:**
Sometimes crowded but you should be fine. Contrary to some people's believe, there actually are (some) speed limits, and I'd suggest not going any faster than 130KM/H for your car insurance's sake (if you're faster than that and have an accident, the car insurance might cause some problems). Driving on the Autobahn (Highway) can be really stressfull. The streets are in general way narrower than they are in the US and people drive way faster so be prepared for that. And don't block the left lane (it's only meant to be used to overtake others). Heavy cars and tucks will be on the far right lane usually - the go around 80KM/H.

**At bars or restaurants:**
Compared to the US, people working there will not care about you. The waiter will not stop by your table every couple of minutes to ask if you need anything. They will, however, take a look if your glass is empty. There are no free re-fills in German restaurants either. You kind of are expected to tip but not 20% or anything crazy like that. 

**Police:**
When you're in your car, police can stop you and do something called ""Allgemeine Verkehrskontrolle"". They'll ask for your drivers license and stuff like that. You're required to show some kind of ID, which they will ask for. 

There's nothing like an open container law in Germany so if your buddy is driving, you can drink as much as you want. 

**A few phrases you should remember:**

""Entschuldigung, Ich spreche (leider) kein Deutsch.""
""Sorry, I don't speak German."" 

""Wie viel kostet (das)?""
""How much is (this)?""

""Ich war's nicht!""
""It wasn't me!"" ;) 

""Danke.""
""Thank you.""

It's not much but it should be enough and people will really apprechiate it. Everyone in Germany is supposed to be able to have a conversation in English but most people's English is really, really bad.

true,Spawn_More_Overlords,null,null,"Nuremberg is a beautiful old city, and a decent place to walk around.  I would say the same of Weimar, which is close to Buchenwald if you want to tour a concentration camp (serious buzzkill, but it is at least interesting).  Both of those cities are relatively close to your path.  I have no idea how to park in Germany, I've only ever taken trains, so I can't advise you there.  

In Berlin make sure you see the Holocaust memorial (again, a buzzkill, but really interesting urban architecture), and if you can find the time, the Memorial to the German Resistance http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_to_the_German_Resistance.  It is an interesting memorial, at the place where Stauffenburg (Tom Cruise from *Valkyrie*) was executed.  If it appeals to your interest, its worth looking at, and is a great example of how you have to look for the shades of gray in history.  Also in Berlin are the Pergamon museum and the Museum of German history, both of which are most excellent, albeit not free (we can't all have a Smithsonian).

Finally, you'll be driving by Jena, which was the site of one of the largest land battles in European history (Napoleonic wars) and while I've never been, I would absolutely love to go.  

As for non historical things, just always drink the local beers.  You can get Franziskaner and Becks anywhere.

La Gauloise restaurant, 59 ave de la Motte-Picquet, 15th arr. (at La Motte-Picquet metro stop) – traditional bistro with excellent food (if it’s summer and the gazpacho is available, order it), outdoor sidewalk seating

Oudino Restaurant, 17 rue Oudinot, 7th arr, more modern-looking bistro with some traditional bistro fare updated; lovely steak tartare

Fish La Boissonnerie, 69 rue Seine, Saint Germain des Prés – excellent fish and seafood restaurant, good spot for lunch or dinner in a great shopping area

Brasserie Balzar, 49 rue des Ecoles, 5th arr – traditional brasserie; great spot for lunch after Musee Cluny (Musee National du Moyen-Age) – well known to tourists but also heavily frequented by natives

true,DemDude,null,null,"**IMPORTANT NOTES ABOUT DRIVING IN GERMANY:**

Sorry for the bold all-caps, but this is really important: You can only overtake others via their left side. DO NOT overtake on the right. This is illegal and especially dangerous because people won't be expecting it. Unless there's very slow traffic, ONLY overtake on the left. In slow traffic, just do it like everyone else, follow the flow. In inner city traffic, overtaking on the right may be unavoidable and is usually not problematic.

DO NOT turn right at red lights unless there's a green arrow pointing in that direction. While this is apparently legal in some places in the states, it isn't in Germany.

In Berlin, there will be Bus lanes in most larger roads (on the right), keep off them except when entering turn lanes, even when most cabs will be using them to rush past you.

Pay attention to cyclists, some couriers in Berlin are positively suicidal. Just always pay attention, drivers in Germany drive much faster than you're used to from the states. In Berlin, unless you're stuck in the clusterfuck that is rush hour, people going more than 40mph in the inner city between sets of lights are an average sight. You better stick to the legal 30mph/50kph, or lower, whatever you're comfortable with.

Also, some cunts will wash your windshield at ""Großer Stern"", the large roundabout in the center of Tiergarten. No need to pay them ;)

Oh, and keep in mind that you will likely get a manual transmission car unless you specify that you want an automatic.

Otherwise, you will be fine. Germans are very concentrated and friendly drivers, so if you ever fuck up a little, don't worry. You will notice that using the horn is a rarity here, when compared to the states. And people will stop for you or give you right of way. Most of us are pretty nice :)

Munich and Berlin are my two favorite cities in Germany, you made a great choice. They're very different cities, too, so it's a nice contrast!

General touristy things you should know: German cities are very safe, so don't worry so much (lots of people tend to). Most Germans will at least speak basic english and will be happy to give you directions when asked nicely. If someone doesn't understand what you're saying, don't just keep repeating it louder and louder, try and say it differently - contrary to apparently popular American belief, very loud, obnoxiously enunciated english is not some kind of universal language everyone in the world understands.

edit: Also, I'm not sure what the rules concerning continuous vs dashed separator lines in roads are in the US, but here are the German rules

* Outside cities, dashed lines mean overtaking is permitted. This doesn't necessarily mean that both lanes go in the same direction, it just means that if there is no oncoming traffic, overtaking is allowed. (Inside cities, overtaking is generally illegal in single lane roads, unless the vehicle in front of you is going very slow)

* Continuous lines are illegal to cross for overtaking. You will find that on rural roads where the speed limit is 100kph, dashed lines will turn continuous inside and around hard turns. These rules also apply on the Autobahn, so if you're in a lane with a continuous line on one or both sides, do not cross them.",0,1344633368,null,0,1344652029,0,c5r8q98,t3_y0ira,t1_c5r8q98,t3_y0ira,null,1429605567,19,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,19

I did a study abroad in Germany, and I had a blast. I went to Germany after only two semesters of German. It was tricky, but I survived, so as you long as you make an effort to talk to people and immerse yourself in the language, you'll be fine.

Here are some tips, in no particular order:

* Your college may offer you a semester ticket that allows free travel on all public transport in your state. Take advantage of this!
* Drücken means push. Ziehen means pull. Internalizing these two words will make all the difference in the world when you're trying to navigate the campus.
* It rains a lot in Germany. Have a handy rain jacket or umbrella just in case.
* Get a library card for your local library, stat. I did this and read tons and tons and tons of comics and kid lit like Goosebumps (Gänsehaut), and I think it was a huge help for understanding sentence construction.
* Eat the following: Kinder Eier, Berliner, Döners mit Scharf.
* Everything closes on Sundays and on holidays. Plan your grocery shopping around this, or you'll end up at the Hauptbahnhof buying Chicken-Burgers at McDonald's.
* When you make tons of friends, buy a Schönes Wochenende ticket to travel through Germany on a weekend trip. It's cheap and fun.
* Look up Pro7 and RTL for streaming German TV. There's a TV tax, so you may want to stick with online video.
* The flea market is an awesome place to buy veggies and bulk spices.
* Turkish food is delicious.
* In German movie theaters--or at least in CineStar, one of the main theater companies--they walk through the theater selling ice cream before the show. ""Möchten Sie Eiiiiiiis?""
* You have to ask for the bill in restaurants. It helps if you know the word for ""bill.""
* Carry your passport, always. Polizei roam the trains checking tickets, and if you have a student ticket, your passport will come in handy.
* Carry coins for bathroom visits. Bathrooms are guarded by attendants, and you've got to pay the toll or risk a glare.
* Speaking of bathrooms, if you're desperate, there's always a bathroom in Karstadt, a big department store.
* Garbage sorting is king.
* LIDL cashiers are fast, so you'll have to pack your groceries quickly.
* Carry cash. Credit is way, way less common than in the U.S.
* When you buy drinks, the bottles will have a Pfand attached to them. This is basically a small deposit charged to get you to recycle your plastic. Save all your bottles, and when you turn them all in, you'll get a little slip to save money on your grocery bill.
* There are multiple levels of sparkling water.

First and foremost, the current EU apparatus is an appalling and ineffective bureaucracy full of democracy deficits. If more rights are transferred to it, we can probably safely assume that this will not change fundamentally. We will probably - like all of the rules the EU has puked up - get a defective patchwork full of problems. For example, if any votes of the people do take place (which is not certain), for ""fairness"" reasons we will probably see things like granting Malta or Cyprus the same amount of weight as Germany or France in any decision making - as has often been the case so far. Then the vote of one Maltese will weigh as much as the vote of eighty Germans, which will also grossly distort political intentions and directions.

Now if there is some sort of democratization, we are probably also faced with the problem of heterogeneity - parties and/or politicians will probably inevitably focus on the interests of their own state and will probably also attract votes from their own state.

Architecture of the superstate aside, how on Earth will this solve any problems with the financial crisis? The debt is far too high in nearly every country, including Germany.  The credit worthiness of the state will soon be so low that the ECB will have to finance it, which depending on your view may not be that bad.

But then, even debt problems aside, how on Earth will this solve any structural and economic problems in the near or even medium term? Will the super government suddenly replace the entire administration in every southern state that isn't doing well financially? Even if there's a great administration and a great environment concerning taxes, laws, etc - how can anyone expect the economies to converge very quickly? It is going to be a process that takes many, many years and may never fully succeed in many areas, meaning that there is still going to be a HUGE deficit problem every year in nearly every state. So the weak states will STILL have a currency which is too strong for them to improve and the strong states will STILL be dragged down by having to pay for weak states.

Or will it simply end up in a central socialist planned economy that will totally impoverish everyone?

If the state does converge, at what level will it end? Will everyone be dragged up to Germany's and Finland's level or - more likely - will everyone be dragged down to Italy's or Spain's or even Portugal's level of productivity?

For Germany in its current state it is counter productive for everyone else to become more competitive, because their competetivity advantage drives that ridiculously export based economy. Their export based economy is very unhealthy, but returning to a national currency would also eat balance domestic market and exports a lot while offering many more advantages and removing a lot of these risks.

A LOT of HUGE things can go wrong in this undertaking and I do not trust the bureaucrats in Brussels to work out any of these. King Barroso will drive the entire superstate into the ground.

Since you sound pretty worried about your language experience simply make every effort to immerse yourself in the language when you get there (or with books, streaming TV, etc. before you go). There may be other Americans with you, or Germans may try to practice their English with you. While this is all well and good for making friends, it won't help you acclimate or improve your German.
Even simply answering questions in broken/improper German shows you're making the effort and will go a long way. I often had people switch to English to try to help make things easier, but by responding in German every time they would eventually get the polite hint.
