I would tell him he has no business telling me what the tax rates I should have in my country. We don't have a one world government, we have national ones. The people of France have elected a leader who promised to tax the rich and he has. So let me turn the question around - who are you to tell the French people that they can't tax rich people that highly?

&gt;That's up for those who make that amount of money to decide. The same could be said about the previous example, that if you aren't happier with bread and water you'll never be happy and so all your work after a certain threshold should be taxed immensely.

You need a certain amount of money to buy the necessities. After that you can buy luxuries. But after you have enough to buy all the gadgets, dozens of properties and a yacht, what else are you going to buy to make you happier? I'm asking for serious examples, what can you do with 8 million euros a year that you can't do with 3? If you think there is a difference you should be able to give me at least one example.

The law of diminishing returns applies here, the more you earn the less each individual euro means to you, up to a point where extra money will not make you life better in anyway - and you have to look outside material wealth to increase your happiness and well-being.

&gt;That arguing could also be used against you like ""oh, you're not happy with more than the minimum wage? Uou have a computer, a web connection, a roof you can sleep under and clothes and you're not happy? Society ought to take almost that away from you as the extra money isn't going to help and there are those that need it more"". This is stealing with the justification that the person being robbed is better off than you - that doesn't make it fair.

You obviously see taxation as theft or punishment - that is not the purpose of taxation. They would be no need to take away everything from over the minimum wage away from everyone - the money would not be needed to run public services. All I am saying is that when more money is needed, it should be the rich that pay the most.

When you say things like ""that's up for those who make that amount of money to decide"" and ""This is stealing with the justification that the person being robbed is better off than you"" then I wonder how you think the tax system should work. It seems that you are against progressive taxation altogether. Are you saying that people should decide their own rates of tax? That there should be a flat tax?

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;In that case, taxes would have to be low enough so that the lower income people could have access to basic needs with what they make after taxes.

Or the rates can be set at a 'normal' value like 25% and the social benefits of lower income families raised. You know, instead of the poor paying a lower percentage than the wealthier, everyone paying the same rate but the government intervening directly to help the most disadvantaged - instead of not taxing, taxing and then giving back in benefits.

&gt;This means lowering taxes to minimum wage rates, which would shrink the State (not just the government) unproductively, because a State that is too small forces people to spend too much money on healthcare, education, etc. instead of spending it in the real economy.

I don't understand this bit. How does this affect wages or healthcare and education?

Oh, and it's not the role of the government to spend money and participate in the economy, it only has to regulate it. Despite your ideology, you at least have to acknowledge that the state-business sector of the state is highly inefficient, here in Portugal most state-owned companies are deep buried in debts while their private competitors manage to provide the same service and not be a burden to society.

&gt;Of course, you can turn those things into 'real economy' by privatizing them, but then people simply won't have access to it because they can't afford it. Quality of life goes abck to the 19th century (or worse).

Firstly, the tendency is for costs to reduce, not increase, as there's fierce competition to lower costs and attract customers where as in the state costs can be very high, you just don't notice it because it's all paid through taxes - either way, the money has to come from somewhere.

Secondly, no, nobody will go back to the XIX century, there's plenty of more developed than us which have much less social benefits than we do and they manage just fine, perhaps much better than us. I do agree that essential sectors like healthcare and education need to be available to all, but even that can be done by subsidies, you don't need to actually own the infrastructure.

It's actually worse for the consumer if he pays taxes and then doesn't pay anything in the public hospital or in a public school than it would be if he went to a private hospital and school which provides a better service or provides the same service but isn't as expensive but then also didn't pay anything because it's the state that pays the bill.

&gt;This is why I think taxes should be established in accordance to how much a person needs to keep a lifestyle that is in accordance to their social class. In other words, if people earn X more than what is established as necessary to live (luxuries included), then that person has a bigger ability to contribute to the State, thus must pay more taxes, than a person who barely earns more than what is necessary to live.

Social class? Limiting incomes? No, that's socialism, the state doesn't know best, it's the individuals that should decide what they should with their money. Just because you need to pay taxes to keep the courts running, the police working and an healthcare system available to all doesn't mean you should limit incomes and tell people they can only receive x.

People tend to notice you and I often get asked if I'm a ""real"" german or from somewhere in the South. I don't mind, it's not meant as an insult. I wouldn't say there isn't any racism, depending on where you are moving you and if you ever have kids with similar skin will have a hard time ever being accepted as a real German. I lived here all my life, speak perfect German, but I'm still not a real German to a lot of people (two years ago there was a pretty big national discussion about immigrants not integrating properly a lot of people supported the racists notions of the book that sparked it. I talked to tons of friends and they said that immigrants should integrate or get out, I always asked them if I should get out then too, given the fact that I grew up biculturally to which they always replied ""no, you are different of course""). I'm accepted, but more like an adopted child is accepted into a family rather than being a natural child. It's not something I care much about so I don't really mind and I think it is still a minority that has this mindset, but you should know that it exists. Avoid the East, not everybody is racist there, but you most likely will be harassed. I haven't experienced it first hand, but all of my darker friends who have been to the east (even the bigger cities) have experienced similar remarks.  A really uncomfortable truth is, that if you are really dark, like black skin dark you will face racism, especially if you aren't living in the bigger cities. I have been around enough people with bad attitude like that. German ethnocentrism is still a thing

With all that being said, your skin color won't  be a problem, there is no need not to move here out of fear of racism. For the absolute biggest part people won't have a problem  with you and even if they do, they won't show it to your face or hurt your or anything like that.

In the poorest parts of Germany, there are some rampant skinhead gangs that have even declared territories of their own, but it's unlikely you'll ever go there. After all, these gangs only exist because there's no infrastructure, no jobs, no future - the usual stuff...

Be prepared to see and hear a lot of things that may seem offensive to you, though. That we don't usually see any blacks also means that there are no easy-to-follow taboos like in the US. For instance, people run around in blackface when in costumes because they have never heard about the background. (E. g. children dressed as the African king of the biblical Magi.)

true,[deleted],null,null,"Ok, so you do recognize that people with money who make investements also contribute to society, right?

As for the rest, all of what you just said is based on having someone decide a priori how much someone's work is worth (and I'm using the word 'work' in the sense of 'fulfilling a contract', in other words, it could just be loaning out money). The way I see it, there are two problems with that:

The first is that it implies that work has objective value, and that ""the people"" are capable of making that judgement better than the parties envolved. I disagree, and I believe that in pretty much all cases there are reasons and nuances for the disparity in incomes. I believe that in a free market, if that person's work is worth more than 10 EUR (for someone), then he/she can quit his/her job and get better pay. It's a little difficult to agree with me on this if you view society as a struggle of classes, in which there are only two groups at stake, but I find that that's often a matter of upbringing and that I can't convince you to see it my way. In any case, I think it's still relevant to link to the Wikipedia article for [the subjective theory of value](http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_theory_of_value.com), as this is really what we're discussing here.

My second objection is it's implementation through laws like this tax. First, it is imoral, at least for me. That someone, even if it is ""the people"", ie a majority, should use force to impose a transfer of wealth from one individual to another, even if they are not equally wealthy is authoritatian. In my opinion, democracy is a compromise, by no means a completely fair solution for society's problems. Second, it's inefective, because ""the people"" are really represented by a discrete number of government polititians who are human and therefore are biased, make mistakes, and are always subject to special interests. Third, it's a drag on the economy: if you take 75% of income from the part of the population who has the means to create jobs, what incentive do they have to make investments? Sure, you still have corporations and smaller personal ventures, and there are only 1.5k of them, but it's by no means a good thing and it only gets worse if you set that 1 million bar lower.",0,1350744916,null,0,false,0,c6p9dpi,t3_11rs35,t1_c6p9dpi,t1_c6p7sl2,null,1430196244,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

&gt;Yes, they're exploiting the workers. Dude, before you come up with that level of socialism, present evidence of the abuse of the proletariat in France.

Talking about economics is a level of socialism now? It is basic economics - if a business paid a person the true value that they added to that business, they will make no profit from that person working there. The amount someone gets paid will always be lower than the value they add (unless they are able to set their own wages as CEOs effectively do).

&gt;So Bill Gates and Steve Jobs didn't make millions, they just piggybacked on the work of others and society?

They didn't make millions on their own, thousands of people work for Apple and Microsoft and millions of people buy their products. Microsoft's and Apples products would be useless without people providing an electricity infrastructure and in some cases internet and mobile phone infrastructure to. Also they would be useless without people with enough disposable cash to buy them. 

&gt;And now you're saying the alternative to 75% is anarchy. The wealthy will probably indeed piss off but rather to Switzerland where they'll just pay 8.5%. France will lose millions, the Swiss will benefit much more - just as planned, no?

That won't happen. Firstly I don't think all rich people are as selfish as you portray them to be, and will not all leave because they are being asked to pay more at a time when their country is in need - the tax is even temporary so it is only for a short term.

true,dhcoli,null,null,"I agree with most of the commenters that there is very little *overt* racism, especially in the former West.  However, the claim that there isn't any racism at all in Germany is misleading.  *Everyone* is a little racist--we can't help it.  It's a psychological quirk that is probably the result of evolving to live in very small (~100 individual) communities and the resulting need to distinguish between in-group and out-group.  I guess it doesn't surprise me much that most of the commenters here don't think there is any racism in Germany as they are probably most young and don't want to believe that they are racist (due to the strong connection with National Socialism).  But, that doesn't mean that they don't stereotype based on race.  I work in academics where people are generally more tolerant and culturally sensitive than the general population, but I am frequently surprised at the stereotypes (often based on race) that my colleagues express.  I'm sure that if you asked any of the people expressing these opinions if their opinion were racist that they would say that it wasn't--and I think they would mean it.  

Adding to this, there is certainly a noticeable anti-foreigner sentiment in Germany.  Of course, there are lots of nice people that are very accepting and like foreigners.  And, as with anywhere, there is a small group of assholes who are overtly anti-foreigner.  However, there is a substantial portion of the population who, although they have no explicit problems with foreigners being here, will never accept said foreigners into their community.  As evidence, look at the large population of Turkish non-citizen legal residents.  Many have lived here for 2-3 generations but aren't considered ""German"".  Even someone like Mesmut Oezil (a star on the German national football team) is considered to be Turkish and not German even though his mother is German and he was born in Germany.  That's not to say that people don't like him or that they don't want him on the German soccer team, but it does make him an Outsider.  Another example--I was recently at a party and was speaking with a couple of guests (in German).  After spending some time speaking to one of them, the other says to her friend: ""They don't understand you.  They're (insert nationality)""--despite the fact that I had just spent 5-10 minutes speaking with her friend *in German*.  She meant no harm by it, but she had marked me as an Outsider *only because of my nationality*.  ...and I look German and have a German last name.  These little snubs give me an idea of what it must feel like for my non-white friends.

So, I guess you should clarify what you mean by racist.  Do you mean that you will be targeted for verbal and physical abuse because of your race?  If so, then I think you have very little to fear.  Or, do you mean that people will make assumptions about you based purely on your skin color?  Or that you will be considered an Outsider?  Depending on your attitude, this may not be a problem for you, but you will probably run into this with relative frequency.  Personally, I sort of revel in being an Outsider.  You can get away with a lot of stuff that an Insider couldn't get away with (fashion, etc.).  But, I know from my friends that it can wear on a person.  Just so you're aware that this exists.

true,chrisjd,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt;Really? I could think of many examples. Take Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Google's founders. Don't you think their innovation and ideas have been worth more than 10 million dollars? Think of the value their company has provided to the customers, the employees, and the society as a whole. Of course, they couldn't have done it without the labour of their workers, but it's thanks to Page and Brin the company exists in the first place. With Google current market capitalization of $222 bln, you're saying they don't deserve even 0,0045% of it. Do you think Google owes its success to people who have started it in less than 0,0045%?

Nope, they probably deserve more and they do have much more than that. But this has nothing to do with anything being discussed. We're talking about whether people should be paying 75% tax on earnings over 1 million euros. How much 10 million is out of 220 billion has now relevance at all to the discussion, especially since Larry Page and Sergey Brin's wealth will be due to the shares they own in the companies they founded, not from wages.

&gt;&gt;Labour of thousands of workers who are not paid the true value of their Labour (they would have to be paid less, otherwise the business would not make a profit).

&gt;This is completely untrue.

Yes it is. See my other comment or just try to get an understanding of basic economics.

&gt;There are two basic ways to determine this. The first is for someone, typically the government, to decide how much each thing is worth based on an arbitrary set of principles. It has been tried and we have learned the hard way that it doesn't work, to put it mildly. The second way is to have a free market, in which how much something is worth is defined simply by how much people are willing to pay for it by their own free choice. And it turns out what people are willing to pay for other people's labour greatly varies. Virtually all economists agree today this is the system which works best, providing most wealth and well-being.

&gt;Let's say I'm a business owner. Why do I pay the CEO 10 times more than a junior employee, as opposed to paying everybody the same, or maybe paying the CEO only 2 times more if that's the number you've somehow calculated to be ""morally right""? It sure isn't because I like they guy, in fact I probably think he's an asshole like most CEOs. I do it because that's the market prize of his labour - the prize collectively decided by individual decisions of all the employers in the market. It turns out it is worth it to pay a lot to a CEO, because his labour is making important, difficult decisions and a good CEO can make a big difference. That's what worth is - the gain you acquire from something.

I don't know about the law in France, but in the UK CEOs can effectively set their own pay level by packing the remuneration committee with their friends and fellow CEOs, they will then sit on their remuneration committees and scratch each others backs this way. The business owners cannot stop this - shareholder votes are only advisory. So the free market principles you've described don't apply.

Edit: Also the government doesn't have to work to free market principles, and it isn't a black and white choice  between communism and libertarianism as you have described. The government should do what they decide is best for the people and if they decide that insanely high levels of executive pay are damaging to society and so decide to tax them, then they should, especially if the public agree with them and they were elected promising to do just this.",0,1350746105,null,0,1350746317,0,c6p9kwx,t3_11rs35,t1_c6p9kwx,t1_c6p8kke,null,1430196350,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

But moving to fiscal transfers can't be railroaded through like that, you'll need referendums in most of europe and will they pass? In more than a few I'd say no.

And so this crisis is going to drag on forever, we'll be here in another two years having the same discussion. So this is my frustration, it has been decided, by everyone that ""more EU"" and ""more centralisation"" is the only way to prosperity in europe and that's what we're going to get whether we like it or not. No other options that don't directly enhance the power of the EU will be considered.

Indeed, you're spot on comrade. No man is an island, humans are social products and we should ground our rights in this social reality. Even though we don't exist as stand-alone abstract entities with innate rights there is, unfortunately, a plethora of entitled privileged selfish narcissists in America who expose  this infantile  and morally bankrupt perspective.

Contrast this with Europe which is a much more mature society as it can be ascertained from the emphasis placed on solidarity and social cohesion.

From what I can tell, reminiding the average American capitalist libertarian  that he has duties and responsabilities towards society at large  is enough to make him go in a rage and  to cower behind appeals to  ridiculous and irrational slippery slopes and emotional arguments about the sanctity of their ""God-given rights"", even if it's something that would never concern the overwhelming majority of people.

In most of the big cities and in nearly all of western  and south germany, you don't have to fear racism at all. Sure, there will be some bigots here and there, but they are rare and usually not even vocal. Racism is not a problem there.

true,HammermanBaer,null,null,"I agree that one should not be afraid of racism in Germany. I study the concepts of integration and migration and their history in Germany, and I would respectfully disagree to a point that racism in Germany is so limited - there is a tendency towards some ""everyday racism,"" in that if you don't look like the German norm, you might not be perceived as German. This manifests itself often in the supposedly innocent question ""where are you from?"" meaning *you look foreign, you can't be German*, which is, in my opinion, potentially heinous when the individual has grown up in Germany and speaks Hochdeutsch or some other dialect fluently. 

In this way there is a long-standing association of being German with the German ethnicity, which was even enforced on a legal level through the passing of citizenship exclusively through *ius sanguinis* until the year 2000. This meant that only children born to parents who had German citizenship received that citizenship, i.e. inherited their status as Germans. Today there is a limited form of *ius solis* in Germany, meaning that an individual born here to legal residents receives German citizenship, with some fine print. This signifies an important paradigm shift in the German identity, which I believe is leading to a more open society - Germany has never been more open to immigrants than today and as one I am very happy here.

Racism is a key topic in German public discourse at the moment, though the actual use of the term is almost non-existent - German history with National Socialism and race has made the word much more of a taboo than in the UK or USA. In that way racism is most often semantically connected with that time, i.e. right-extremists and neonazis and violence against foreigners / marginalized ethnicities.  But racism in terms of discrimination and exclusion does exist in Germany - but the country is in no way unique in that way however. Today racism hides behind the slightly more socially acceptable stance of Islamophobia, or the belief in absolute cultures which establish 'parallel societies.' A good (and popular!) example for this line of thought is Thilo Sarrazin's book ""Germany is abolishing itself.""

Good luck finding any modern economist who would agree with your statement that the only way for businesses to make profit is not to pay workers the true value of their labour.

Any economist from any era would agree with me that the only way for a business to make a profit would be not to pay workers the true value of their labour. Let me give you an example. I own a widget selling and making business. I can sell each widget for £10, and they cost £5 in raw materials. I employee Bob, who can make 10 widgets an hour. Now the value to my bushiness of Bob's labour is £50 an hour, since in one hour he has turned £50 of raw materials into £100 worth of widgets. But I pay Bob £50 an hour I will make no profit. I will have to pay him less to make a profit.

Even this example is more complicated than it needs to be. By definition profit is revenue minus costs, and if you pay the employees the true value of what they add to the business then your costs will always equal your revenues.",0,1350749721,null,0,false,0,c6pa9a7,t3_11rs35,t1_c6pa9a7,t1_c6p9z8l,null,1430196661,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

They were elections and there is an elected government. If we want to discuss the election law and how it distributes seats in the parliament that's another issue. Also the majority of people are not roaming the streets looking for food. Yet anyway. Homeless people in Athens were always there. What is happening to Greece is that it is being transformed from a middle income country to a low income one right now. It's not in any way a smooth transition, there are people who are facing serious difficulties, like pensioners that have been working their whole life, and worker's rights are really hurt but that is also a policy that has been going on in the west for some years now. The text really wants to create a sobbing effect and I think it really takes away from the more serious issues threatening the country with that way.

Also, I am what most people would call a ""leftist"" though I support no party since they have all disappointed me in Greece but I believe in grassroots movements of people and I wanted to point out how many people in r/europe tend to put all the Greek left (or maybe generally the ""left"") in the same bag while it's a big and diverse group of people. Sadly most Greeks are too accustomed to sit on their couches and watch TV at home and have never cared going out and discovering the different ways with which some people are trying to survive and adapt to the crisis, they never developed a sense of social solidarity, they only care about their own home (and that's why probably they keep it very clean but litter their cities too much) and their immediate family environment. 

There are many initiatives out there that are being formed in Greek society right now, from agricultural communities to alternative currency communities, from initiatives that try to bypass middlemen in the distribution of food, ecological movements, initiatives that cook for people in need and offer free support in education, all these things that you would put in the wide spectrum of ""left"". So again, please don't put all of Greek left in the same bag, that's the argument Golden Dawn is trying desperately to make in the last months saying absurd stuff like ""leftists are fascists and want to bring their own Stalinist dictatorship to the country"". Also, that's what the media and center politicians try to disseminate, how there are two extreme sides that have formed in Greek society and how they should be avoided (aka vote only for us). While there are extreme ulta-left and anarchist movements, that's not all there is, if not the minority but it's what you hear about all the time since it's the vocal part that causes riots and destruction and the media rushes of course to take advantage of it... so the narration of how the whole ""left"" is also extreme only hurts movements and ideas that struggle for social equality and solidarity in the country right now and convince people to stay at home keep to their job and low salary and avoid thinking any alternatives for this mess.",0,1350750947,null,0,false,0,c6paifd,t3_11sn9d,t1_c6paifd,t1_c6p8mpm,null,1430196780,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

What are you talking about? There was much less poverty in the socialist Eastern states than you can find in the capitalist West.

&gt; a demographically/geographically similar region enjoys prosperity 

That's not actually true. They were richer only by dishonest and deliberate gerrymandering so you don't count the exploited people from peripheral nations used as cheap labour to prop the vile system. You should familiarize yourself with [World-systems theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Systems_Theory).

&gt;   imprisoning  a populace in their own country is not only morally wrong 

Why is wrong to imprison traitors?

&gt; you'll get social unrest which results in anti-government advocacy which invariably results in government crackdowns which as a rule end in tears for someone be they the protesters or the government officials.

The same can be said of any person who moves from one western country to another.  Since people generally don't pick up and move in hopes of becoming poorer. Hell you can say the same thing about people moving from one side of a city to another.

Though I have to say your sentiment that they were jerks just because they wanted a better life is pretty humorous.

&gt;What are you talking about? There was much less poverty in the socialist Eastern states than you can find in the capitalist West.

I knew a guy who immigrated from Poland.  He had a great story from when he was a kid that illustrates the major difference.  He was walking to school one day and saw a line around the block. He decided to skip school to stand in line(even though he didn't know what they were selling at the end of it!) when he told his parents they praised him.

Their names are deleted from the special lists, used for the special stations (cops only). Their names are removed in order to avoid casting double votes (in ""cops only"" and ordinary polling stations). They don't register anywhere again after the removal, they are already registered. Their superiors remove their names from the ""cops only"" lists, used for ""cops only"" polling stations, as they'll go and vote with ordinary citizens. Their names will be in ordinary lists. No occupation is recorded in these lists.

There is no simpler way to put it. That's all there is. It was a non-story from the beginning.

Regarding your terminology, you [wrote above](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/11gsg1/golden_dawn_requests_information_about_immigrant/c6otxr5):

&gt; ""Special polling stations"" means that both policemen and others vote there. ""Regular polling stations"" means that no policemen vote there at all. 

""Special"" for you = citizens + cops

In the previous comment:

&gt; policemen need to go through a procedure in order to **de-register from the special polling stations**

What is the text of the decision?

Yes, Germany does have racists, same as every other country. Racism is more prevalent in the east of Germany, and in rural areas, whereas larger cities are more cosmopolitan.
Racism also does not always carry hostility with it - the small town (15,000 roughly) I live in has it's fair share of old or simple-minded white people who make racist quips that they consider to be in good fun - like saying a black man's made out of chocolate. Patronizing, racist, but not necessarily malicious.
It's also important to note that the two (by far) largest minority groups in Germany are Turks (more in West Germany) and Russians (more in East Germany). They also have to deal with the worst discrimination, whereas the much smaller population of black people for example have to deal more with the aforementioned patronizing and awkwardly racist jokes.

There was [a German documentary](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3QXqjd9cRc) a while ago in which a famous German investigative journalist wore blackface (don't even...) and went around filming people's reactions. It certainly should be taken with a grain of salt as it's very...condensed racism, but it does paint a picture of how racism ""works"" in Germany.

Anyways, I hope the fact that Germany does have it's share of racist like any other country does not deter you. However, one important caveat: Should you decide to move here, be careful not to mistake bluntness for rudeness, and/or rudeness for racism. Germans can come off as grumpy or rude to some people, even when they are not, and I feel most of us are a little apprehensive when it comes to strangers.

If you are referring to my comment about Oezil--of course, he's of Turkish ancestry, and perhaps he is even (partially?) culturally Turkish.  This is a neutral statement.  Ignoring whether the conclusions are positive or negative, making the latter conclusion based on the former observation would be stereotyping and could be considered a form of racism.  As I mentioned in my original comment, we have evolved to make such conclusions almost without thinking because...well, it cuts down on the amount of thinking we have to do.  We almost can't help it.

However, two years ago during the World Cup, people were complaining that less than half of the German national team were actually ""German"", and many (perhaps most) included Oezil in the ""not German"" category.  This is a much more insidious sort of thought because it relegated someone to Outsider status who should technically have been an Insider based solely on his name/appearance.  The reason it is insidious is because being an Outsider instantly creates barriers for a person.  Being the ""right kind"" of foreigner can help overcome these barriers, of course, but make no mistake: the barriers are still there however small they might be.  Of course, this kind of crap happens everywhere--I don't want to single Germany out.  But, it seems that Germans are particularly oblivious to the fact that this occurs, and it can drive us foreigners insane. :)

As a sort of tangent, I find it ironic that forcing integration, which was meant to prevent the formation of so-called ""parallel societies"", has done much more actually to create parallel societies (e.g. multiple generations of Turkish legal non-citizen residents).

Of course, maybe *you personally* are handling such situations commendably.  I don't know as I haven't interacted with you.  It's only with hesitation that I speak in generalities.  But, what I'm telling is that even if *you personally* aren't at all racist, there is still a sort of latent anti-foreigner sentiment in Germany, which one necessarily encounters as a foreigner and which one probably encounters much more frequently if they aren't white.  

Sorry.  I really love your country, but it's the truth.

*EDIT:* Sorry, I didn't answer your question directly.  What I think you should do is fight your intuition to automatically place people in the Outsider category in your mind based on their appearance.

Il y a un peu de ça, mais discuté politique, c'est la malédiction française :)

&gt;Vous pensez que tout ce que fait l'Etat est mieux que ce qui est fait par le privée.

Pas nécessairement non. En tous cas pour ma part je suis le premier a dire que lorsqu'on veut le meilleur rapport qualité-prix, c'est vers le privé qu'il faut se tourné. mais il y a plein de domaine ou on veut pas le meilleur rapport qualité-prix mais un rapport qui penche en faveur de la qualité: éducation, santé, ... je pense que la large majorité des gens préfèrent un peu d'inefficience coté prix et une meilleur qualité (en tous cas quand ça les concernent directement, mais c'est une autre histoire). il y aussi beaucoup de domaine spécifique ou la concurrence a beaucoup de mal a joué, par exemple l'eau: comment un usager passe d'une compagnie a une autre? ça se finit généralement en plein de petit monopole locale, c'est plus sur et plus efficace (a cause des économies d’échelle) que ça soit gérer par l’État. Et c'est aussi moralement satisfaisant qu'une société qui prétend assuré un droit fondamentale se charge elle même ce droit.

&gt;Même si c'est l'Etat [..]Toujours est il que c'est un monopole[...] 

Pas forcement, non. l’état peut aussi jouer un rôle de fond d'investissement ce qui ne déforme pas plus le marché que n'importe quel autre investisseur. il peut aussi jouer le role de financeur indirecte, en investissant dans la recherche publique par exemple. Ce qui déforme le marché, c'est quand l'etat publie des loi ou des décrets pour avantager une compagnie par rapport a d'autre, ou quand il fournit des aides a certaines compagnie et pas a d'autres. de plus ce n'est pas parce que l’état assure un service qu'il est nécessairement fermé a la concurrence. prend l'école par exemple, en plus de l’école publique, tu as des école privée qui reçoivent des aident de l’état (ce que je trouve débile au passage): on ne peut pas parler de monopole.

&gt;Le secteur aérospatiale français c'est rien par rapport à ce que ça pourrait être grâce à des entreprises privées. Pourquoi aucune entreprise ne s'y était mise avant? Parce que le marché n'avait pas encore besoin du secteur aéronautique et parce que les citoyens (futurs entrepreneurs ou investisseurs potentiels) attendaient sagement de voir quel projet l'Etat allait soutenir avec leur argent. Ca a du faire plaisir à certains, ça a due exaspérer d'autres. Au final si les citoyens intérressés avaient investit eux-même l'argent au lieux de forcer tout le monde à le payer, tout le monde aurait été content. Et il est absolument certain que le porjet aurait été mieux développé et plus rapidement.

je suis desolé mais en tout cas dans le cas de l'aérospatial c'est clairement faux. D'abord je connais aucun secteur aérospatial qui ce soit développer sans aide d’état , qu'il soit américain, russe, anglais, chinois, français, ... Deuxièmement investir dans l’aérospatial, c'est fournir un service qu'aucune entreprise n'a les moyen de financé, simplement parce que le privé ne finance jamais a long termes. c'est pour ça que l’état a un rôle a joué dans l’économie d'un pays: c'est le seul acteur qui peut se permettre de faire des investissements a long terme qui ne sont pas forcement ultra rentable en soi (voire a perte) mais qui favorisent la bonne santé économique du pays. finalement, je pense que c'est assez naïf de pensez que l’aérospatial se développent dans un pays en particulier au hasard, en fonction des bonnes volonté, au contraire, c'est parce que l’État a donné l'impulsion initiale que les entreprises et les savoir faire était la quand le marché s'y est intéressé, et nécessairement ça nous a favorisé par rapport a d'autre pays. 

tout ca pour dire que le probleme que j'ai avec l'ultra-liberalisme (absolument tout doit fonctioner en mode libre concurence) c'est l'abandon generalisé de toutes volonté politique. l'etat ne sert a rien (ni a faire la police, il y a des groupe privé pour ca, ni a faire la lois, les contrat remplace tout ca) et les peuples ne peuvent prendre aucune decision concernant leur pays, si ils veulent quelque choses, ils doivent attendre et esperer que quelqu'un avec les financement s'y intéresse (et que ca soit sufisament rentable, evidement, faut pas prendre les gens pour des cons).

Si tu as besoin de sources, voici pour [Boeing](http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-eco/2012/10/11/97002-20121011FILWWW00695-boeingsubventions-l-ue-saisit-l-omc.php) et voilà pour [Airbus](http://www.lemonde.fr/economie/article/2012/03/30/subventions-a-airbus-les-etats-unis-attaquent-de-nouveau-l-ue-a-l-omc_1678485_3234.html).

En pratique, la notion économique de concurrence parfaite n'existe pas quand il y a peu d'acteurs, ce qui est le cas dans les technologies nécessitant de nombreux fonds. On peut prendre par exemple le cas des télécoms en France, où malgré la concurrence, il y avait des ententes entre opérateurs. Or, seule la concurrence parfaite permet d'obtenir une [utilité](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilit%C3%A9) maximale et un marché efficace.

&gt;les monopoles c'est le mal ultime mon ami.

Tu as tort, le monopole est plus efficace que la concurrence dans les secteurs à fortes économies d'échelles. C'est ce qu'en économie on appelle un [monopole naturel](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopole_naturel). Ce n'est donc pas le mal ultime. On peut prendre par exemple le cas du [métro londonien](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Underground#Integration), où la concurrence a mené à des aberrations et où au final, il y a eu un développement anarchique et extrêmement peu efficace, si bien que les transports de Londres ont dû être nationalisés. Tout ceci aurait été plus performant si l'état avait lui même pris en charge ce secteur, contrairement à ce que tu dis.

TL;PL : tes affirmations ne tiennent pas si on a assisté à 2 heures de cours d'économie de base. Il y a des domaines où le privé est meilleur, et d'autres où le public est meilleur. D'un côté comme de l'autre il n'y a pas de solution miracle et tout dogmatisme est stérile.",0,1350759212,null,0,false,0,c6pcap0,t3_11r1b1,t1_c6pcap0,t1_c6pb9cs,null,1430197624,2,false,france,t5_2qhjz,2

true,Shamalow,IDF,Ile-de-France,"&gt; En tous cas pour ma part je suis le premier a dire que lorsqu'on veut le meilleur rapport qualité-prix, c'est vers le privé qu'il faut se tourné. mais il y a plein de domaine ou on veut pas le meilleur rapport qualité-prix mais un rapport qui penche en faveur de la qualité: éducation, santé, ... je pense que la large majorité des gens préfèrent un peu d'inefficience coté prix et une meilleur qualité (en tous cas quand ça les concernent directement, mais c'est une autre histoire)

Parce que la qualité du service est renommé? La qualité des écoles publique est bonnes? Non non, l'Etat n'a pas de raisons d'être meilleur que le privée dans aucun domaine aussi et voir même surtout dans la qualité. Le libre marché assure le meilleur salaire, la meilleur qualité et le meilleur prix. Bon faut que je développe ça, parce que ça me tient vraiment à coeur mais je serais plus rapide pour le reste;).

(la comparaison ne vient pas de moi)
Imagine j'ai un gang qui m'assure un monopole sur le marché de la chaussure. Je suis le seul à produire des chaussures et il n'y aura jamais de concurence grâce à mon gang. Je peux faire payer un prix maximum (juste assez pour que les gens aient quand même envie d'acheter des chaussures et ne restent pas pieds nus) avec une qualité moindre et un choix ultra-limité. Je peux aussi très mal payer mes salariés puisque toutes les personnes qui ont fait des études dans la chaussure (oui c'est peu courant mais je pense que tu vois l'image)  ne peuvent être recrutés que par moi. Voilà, ça c'est un monopole.

Maintenant autre scénario, le chef de ce monopole est un bon samaritain qui ne veut que le bien et qui est même élu par la société. Il va donc fair ele moins de marge possible, faire la meilleur qualité possible, payer le mieux qu'il peut ses employés... Sauf que, qu'est ce qui nous assure que cet entrepreneur est le plus efficace pour répondre à nos besoins? Qu'est ce qui nous que les gens qui votent pour lui et lui-même savent où la production est la moins cher, comment la production est la plus efficiente, comment il faut gérer ses employés... bref toutes les variables qu'un chef d'entreprise ou d'Etat doit gérer?

Dans un système libéral, les chaussures sont produites par pleins de boites différentes qui répondent à toutes les différentes attentes du publics, avec différents salaires,... Celles qui restent vivantes sont les plus efficaces (pas forcément celles qui payent le moins bien hein!).

En partant de ça, je dis que tout ce que fait l'Etat au niveau de monopôle est mal. Non pas parce qu'il est pas social ou que sais-je, mais parce qu'il est inneficace(vient demander quelque chose à l'administration française tu va te faire plaisir), rend la vie de tout le monde beaucoup plus cher et parce qu'il paye mal ses employés (y a des avantages, je te l'accorde, mais ça reste pas top par rapport à des entreprises privées des US **par exemple**).

Après pour ton exemple des pompes à eaux tu parles d'un exemple très limité, je suis pas encore ultra-libéraliste (anarcho-capitaliste), je pense encore à une certaines utilités de l'Etat pour certaines tâches très spécifiques. Quoique en y réflichissant bien on peut toujours toruver des solutions, comme des associations qui gèrent tout ça. Mini-monopole certes, mais que l'on peu destitue du jour au lendemain en stoppant les dons. Mais je vais pas m'étaler là-dessus, comme je t'ai dit je suis pas à ce point là pour le moment.

&gt;Pas forcement, non. l’état peut aussi jouer un rôle de fond d'investissement ce qui ne déforme pas plus le marché que n'importe quel autre investisseur.

Nen mais là le problème reste le même. tu forces les gens à investir dans un projet. Ce projet tu l'a peut-être très très mal évalué et tu va te cracher. (Ce que je pense être le cas pour le projet des sous-marins... C'est juste pas rentable). Si l'investisseur c'est pas l'Etat. A bah merde,k bon pas grave les investisseurs l'on très mal, mais ils étaient au courant des risques, ils feront plus attention la prochaine fois. Si l'investisseur c'est l'Etat... Bah c'est le contribuable qu'y perd, et qu'avait même pas regarder de quoi il s'agissait, ou en l'air, ou en se disant (c'est l'Etat qui fait, il a du parler à des experts). Et une minorité va perdre de l'argent pour une cause qu'il ne supporte pas du tout. (oui c'est la limite de la démocratie). Pendant que la majorité va se mordre les doigts en se disant qu'à l'avenir faudra pas élir des gens qui font des investissements n'importe comment (facile....).

Enfin je ne nie pas le bien qu'a fait l'aérospatiale à la France, je dis simplement que ça aurait pu faire beacoup plus de bien, pour toutes les raisons déjà évoquées.

Au final le débat c'est surtout: Est ce que tu est près à obliger des gens, par la force à payer pour un projet pour lequel tu n'est même pas sûr du résultat. Ca se discute pour des idées très social, mais pour des investissements économique comme ça, je me permet d'exprimer tout mon désaccord.",0,1350761431,null,0,false,0,c6pcs6h,t3_11r1b1,t1_c6pcs6h,t1_c6pc7ux,null,1430197847,1,false,france,t5_2qhjz,1

&gt; Are you expecting that the other 26 countries change their vision of the EU just because the UK says so?

No I'm expecting the other 26 countries to listen to their own populations and put the breaks on this Federalist nightmare. Plenty of nations in the EU are, at best, lukewarm about the idea of a Federal Europe. Holland, Denmark and Sweden for starters. 

Of course the Eurocrats have never liked listening to what they call ""populist"" opinions, and prefer to steamroller ahead over all objections. They ensure that the real power remains with the Commission, an unelected body which is not accountable to the voting populace of the constituent nations. 

&gt; Again, the rest of us should just abide by the UK will, because the UK knows best, right? Maybe it's not the EU that has to change, ever thought of that?

The UK is not the one dictating what others should do. That is Germany and France. When the EU reforms the Commission, and starts actually paying attention to the results of ""No"" referendums, instead of ignoring them, then maybe you can start lecturing us on democracy - but at the moment, you don't have a leg to stand on.

mais justement, j'ais quand meme comencer mon poste par ""lorsqu'on veut le meilleur rapport qualité-prix, c'est vers le privé qu'il faut se tourné."" donc en un sens tu preche un convaincu :-) la ou je suis pas d'accord, c'est que ca serait la solution a tous les problemes. etre sur d'une solution ""taille unique"" qui marche partout et pour tout et qui est toujours la meilleur, c'est pour moi la definition même de l'aveuglement idéologique. 

Pour moi il existe des domaines ou la nature du produit fait que des entreprises privé se retrouve trop facilement en monopole et a choisir entre monopole d'etat et monopole privé, je prefere monopole d’état.

Pour développer un peu, pour moi la libre concurrence est un système qui apporte le meilleur ratio qualité prix. quand on se retrouvent en situation de monopole (libérer de la concurrence) on peut s'orienter comme on veut vers l'un des deux facteurs. encore pour moi, autant un états feras ce qu'il veut dans un sens ou dans l'autre, autant une entreprise s’orientera toujours vers un profit maximum (un exemple célèbre, c'est Nintendo qui c'est retrouvé en situation de monopole (après Séga et avant Sony) et pratiquait des pris honteux) 

Il y a aussi des situations ou as besoin de charger du coté de la qualité, ou des situation ou tu veux pas laisser les entreprise se planter pour trouver le meilleur rapport qualité prix (par exemple tu veux pas que des gens construisent des centrale nucléaire en parpaing avec des employé sous payer parce qu'ils sont persuader que ca reduiras les coups. parce que si le marché décide qu'ils ont tort, on est tous méchamment mort). 

Bon je vais pas épiloguer, mais ce que je veux dire c'est que le libre marché c'est pas la solution unique a tous les problèmes, ça ne correspond ni a certain service, ni aux investissements sur le temps long. 

&gt;Parce que la qualité du service est renommé? La qualité des écoles publique est bonnes? Non non, l'Etat n'a pas de raisons d'être meilleur que le privée dans aucun domaine aussi et voir même surtout dans la qualité.

je pense qu'on as une perception particulièrement injuste et dépréciative de nos écoles (pour tout un tas de raison) surtout comparer aux système plus privatisé (j’échangerais pas notre système éducatif contre le systeme americain), mais pour aller vers un exemple qui seras sans doute plus consensuel, regarde l'hospitalier, et compare le au systeme de santé americain qui lui est plus privatisé (parlons du systeme près obamacare, parce que le systeme precedent etait encore plus privé) bon ben il y a pas photo, c'etait un systeme a la fois moins bon et plus couteux que le notre.

&gt;(vient demander quelque chose à l'administration française tu va te faire plaisir)

Alors je sais pas si tu t'est déjà frotter a d'autre administration, mais c'est loin d’être la pire (perso je me suis frotter a l'administration allemande et écossaise, je préfère la française). de plus quand je demande quelque chose a une administration privé, c'est largement pire (il y a une chance sur deux que ca sois sous traité au Maghreb, les gens font preuve d'une mauvaise fois absolue pour eviter de te rembourser quoique ce soit, ect... )

&gt; parce qu'il paye mal ses employés (y a des avantages, je te l'accorde, mais ça reste pas top par rapport à des entreprises privées des US par exemple)

Ca a pas trop de sens, sauf si tu compares au entreprise qui payent le mieux, mais dans ce cas la il y a aussi des entreprise qui payent beaucoup plus mal. 

&gt;Si l'investisseur c'est pas l'Etat. A bah merde,k bon pas grave les investisseurs l'on très mal, mais ils étaient au courant des risques, ils feront plus attention la prochaine fois. Si l'investisseur c'est l'Etat... Bah c'est le contribuable qu'y perd, et qu'avait même pas regarder de quoi il s'agissait

D'abord c'est pas spécialement différent de quand tu place ton argent a la banque, tu sais pas non plus sur quoi ta banque vas investir et si elle fait faillite c'est toi qui la dans l'os. Deuxièmement en democratie normalement c'est pendant les élections qu'on discute des grands investissement (exemple a la con, hollande a dis pendans ca campagne la ou il metrait de l'argent, et jusqu’à présent il suit a peu prés ce plan) donc les electeurs sont informé. et la minorité pas d'accord, c'est normal qu'elle ait rient a dire c'est le principe meme du vote, on se met d'accord pour prende la decision qui emporte la majorité et aprés on l'aplique, meme si on est pas d'accord (*it's not a bug, it's a feature*).


&gt;Enfin je ne nie pas le bien qu'a fait l'aérospatiale à la France, je dis simplement que ça aurait pu faire beaucoup plus de bien, pour toutes les raisons déjà évoquées. 

Et je soutient le contraire parce que le secteur privé est incapable de faire des investissement a long terme.

&gt;Est ce que tu est près à obliger des gens, par la force à payer pour un projet pour lequel tu n'est même pas sûr du résultat.

Alors déjà, payer des impôts, c'est pas l’État qui vient te faire les poches, c'est le principe même de la citoyenneté et c'est ta contribution consentie du fait même que tu est citoyen a l'action commune. d'autre part, les projet infaillible ça n'existe pas. Et même je dirais qu'un projet qui est un succès pour les un sera un échec pour les autres, il n'y a pas de mesure d'efficacité absolue ( tu peux estimé atteindre ou non le meilleur rapport qualité prix (et encore), mais c'est trés loin d’être équivalent a ""le plus efficace""). au final pour moi, l'intervention de l'etat, c'est la base meme de la democratie, parce que ce sont les choix fait par la nation pour choisir sont avenir. si l'etat ne fait rien, n'intervient dans rien, est ce que le votes des gens a encore un sens si il n'a plus aucune puissance? est ce qu'on est encore en democratie?


bref, si tu répond (comme je l’espère ;-) ) j'aimerais que tu répondent particulièrement a ces points la:

* Quel est le role que doit jouer l'etat pour toi ?
* Libre marché et long termes.
* Libre marché et santé (que fait on si le meilleur ratio qualité prix met en danger la vie des gens/ n'est pas suffisant pour aider le maximum de gens)
* Est ce que tu pense que la libéralisation en cours de la Grèce, de l’Espagne, du Portugal, vont donné des super résultats? 
* Est ce que tu pense réellement que l’impôt est une agression?

The entire collection was pretty neat and aired on either BBC4 or Film4 all of once a about 4 or 5 years ago.

The Christmas Tale was the best one, though, and starred Ivana Baquero of Pan's Labyrinth amongst others and was just a really good twist on horror films. Edit: Woo, found the trailer. Trust me it's really rather good: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlBrtjR4gTU

Also going to recommend Angel-A from Luc Besson. As usual with him it's wonderfully stylized but more than that it is a simple and rather beautiful modern fairy tale that I cannot say enough good things about. The soundtrack is fantastic, too.

And L'illusionniste has to be seen. Somewhat difficult to describe, entirely lacking coherent dialogue in any language, though ostensibly a French film, it takes place largely in a beautifully realised version of Edinburgh and is heartbreakingly beautiful in its closing moments.

L'arnacoeur was absolute nonsense but really damn fun. Romantic comedy, sort of an anti-Hitch, where the main character's job is breaking couples up, usually at the request of rich protective fathers worried about their little girls. Naturally, he falls for one of his targets, and vice versa. Stars Romain Duris and Vanessa Paradis, both of whom I would gladly share a bed with.

The Brescia side of lake Garda is kind of well known for its ""fancy"" night life, discos mainly, so if you're into that, you won't have to move much, otherwise, and I think that's your case, consider Brescia or Verona.

About Verona's nightlife I know nothing. Still, go visit the city and remember San Zeno's Basilica, I love that church.

I don't know much about Brescia either, since I usually hang out more in    Bergamo (like Verona, Bergamo deserves a 1 day trip), but when I go there I usually go to Borgo Whurer, which is a little neighborhood full of bars and pubs. You will find a good pizza at Pizzeria Smeraldo.

Buñuel - if you don't know him you're so lucky because you can watch a bunch of his movies for the first time and it's going to be great. The exterminating angel, The discreet charm of the bourgeoisie, Belle de jour are my favorite, but there's a handful of equally great ones.

Tarkovsky - Solaris, but Andrei Rublëv is equally good and less known

Fellini - this is cinema history: I would pick 8 1/2 among all.

Risi - The easy life

Petri - Investigation on a citizen above suspicion

It's a pity that a few very good classic Italian movies cannot be appreciated fully from abroad, because of their use of patois and dialects (L'armata Brancaleone, I soliti ignoti, Miseria e nobiltà).

Unlike the EU which has 27 Member States and has quasi-Federalist/Functionalist integration mechanisms the Council of Europe works as a 'classical' International Organization based on intergovernmental co-operation. The ECHR (the Charter = Document) and the ECtHR (its Court) are an important institution for the protection of fundamental rights not only in the EU but also in countries like Turkey and Russia which would otherwise may not protect fundamental rights in a stringent manner. Individuals whose rights in the ECHR are infringed may sue the Contracting State under certain conditions (defined in its case law; e.g. exhausting all local remedies or proving that such an action would be futile). Also, the EU at its inception as the ECSC and subsequent forms following treaty reforms and amendments did not encompass a framework for the protection of fundamental rights. It was only with the expansion of the scope of the EU that a necessity in the protection of fundamental rights became apparent for the EU. That is were the ECHR and the ECtHR came in: The CJEU (Court of Justice of the EU) took the ECHR and the jurisprudence into account when developing its fundamental rights jurisprudence. Today, there are various references and tie-ins between the two Courts and the EU is negotiating its accession to the ECHR at the moment (problematic as to relation between Courts/Procedure/the fact that the ECHR is an Agreement between Sovereign States and EU accession would make it a mixed agreement = How is the responsibility between Member States and EU regulated?). Therefore, the Council of Europe was and is very important for the safeguarding of fundamental rights. 

I am of the opinion that the Council of Europe is an important institution because it had and still has an important role in the Protection of fundamental rights in the EU and in other European countries with more 'questionable' standards. Further, the intergovernmental conferences are a good way to bring together a large number of European States.

&gt;mais justement, j'ais quand meme comencer mon poste par ""lorsqu'on veut le meilleur rapport qualité-prix, c'est vers le privé qu'il faut se tourné."" donc en un sens tu preche un convaincu :-)

Désolé j'avais mal lu. Pourtant tu me montres après l'exact contraire dans ton discours. C'est donc que tu n'est pas entièrement d'accord avec cette image:

&gt;Pour moi il existe des domaines ou la nature du produit fait que des entreprises privé se retrouve trop facilement en monopole et a choisir entre monopole d'etat et monopole privé, je prefere monopole d’état.

En effet, si tu te rappels de mon image il y avait bien un gang qui aidait notre entreprise. Ce gang, c'est l'Etat, et il soutient les monopoles systématiquement... Quand on a des lobbys, en général ça vient des grandes entreprises. En réalité, sans Etat il n'y aurait pas de lobby donc pas de monopole et ce quelque soit l'échelle! Même les avions, même l'aéronautique! Les avions, c'est l'exemple typique, je sais pas si t'as remarqué mais tous les pays ont une compagnie aérienne à leur nom. Ces compagnies aériennes ont un monopole. Mais c'est un peu la faute du citoyen d'ailleurs, les gens, les avions, ils aiment bien, c'est gros, ça se voit. Et que ce soit en construction en transport les Etat sont donc près à les fincancer parce que finalement les Etat bah... Ils sont nationalistes (you don't say!!) et donc il vont financer les trucs qui se voient et qui rendent leur nation fier.

Pour l'aéronautique c'est exactement pareil. Le premier drapeau posé sur la Lune est américain je te rappel. Y a pas eu un drapeau de l'humanité ou que sais je. Non, le voyage vers la lune était un évènement ultra-nationaliste qui aurait pu ne pas l'être dans un système libéral.

Pour tes question maintenant:

&gt;Quel est le role que doit jouer l'etat pour toi ?

Celui d'être quasi-inexistant, réduit à la justice (ainsi qu'à la police et l'armée peut-être, je suis pas encore décidé...). Un système totalement libéral sans aucune réglementation chelou de l'Etat. Juste une présence contre les violences extrêmes.

Pas démocratique? Oui et non. D'un côté les entreprise n'auront plus de limites et pourrront s'adonner à toutes leurs fantaisies. De l'autre si une majorité souhaite tel ou tel acte (que sais-je par exemple avoir un seul type de connexion USB (oui bah je pioche dans les faits réel, aucun Etat n'a forcé les entreprise à ne faire qu'un seul format)) il sera réalisé parce qu'une majorité, ça équivaut à une très très grosse demande sur le marché.

Mais là tu sais on entre dans le point où libéraliste contre socialiste est un débat sans fin. Je crois que c'est là la différence fondamentale. Les libéraux pensent que le marché s'adapterais à n'importe quelle condition de la part du public, même par exemple la sûreté du nucléaires. Tout se fait aussi dans la réputation, une entreprise qui fait travailler des petits enfants, moi je vais pas acheter chez eux. non pas parce q'un Etat m'a dit qu'il fallait pas. Mais parce que des entreprises privée, des journaux, m'on prouvé que cette entreprises engageait des petits enfants. Si le travail des enfants est un point sufisament important pour tout le monde sur le marché, l'entreprise en question sera ruiné. Mais j'ajouterais que cela implique que les gens comprennent mieux les principes de base du marché. Le nombre de personnes que j'ai vu un I-phone à la main me dire que apple faisait des trucs horribles, j'ai envie de pleurer... Mais ça ça vient du fait qu'on attend tout de l'Etat. On cherche pas vraiment de par nous même. On se rend pas compte de l'impact de nos achats.

&gt;Libre marché et long termes

Je vois pas le problème. Un investisseur intelligent peut le faire à long terme voire très long terme si il cherche à faire plaisir à ses successeurs. Les investisseurs cherchent le profit, mais dans un monde totalement libéral où toutes les marges sont très faibles dans les investissement à court ou moyens termes (du à la rude concurence), le véritable moyen de se faire de l'argent, c'est parfois d'investir à long terme. Tu sous-estimes l'inteligence du marché. Si personne n'investit encore dans le maromoteur c'est parce que c'est pas rentable, et ce même dans le futurs par rapport à d'autres technologies renouvelables.

Là dessus je dois aussi parler un peu de la singularité, je sais pas si tu sais ce que c'est. En gros que notre connaissance croit de façons expodentielle. Si tu fais l'investissement trop tôt tu crées une bulles. Par exemple la bulle internet en 2000. Pourtant aujourd'hui internet se révèle effectivement être un bon investissement. Mais en an 2000 les investissements ne pouvait se rentabiliser immédiatement car l'internet était trop petit. Un investissement à long terme, n'est pas toujours bon, on s'en mord parfois les doigts. si les investisseurs choississent de ne pas investir à long terme c'est que parfois, ils on raisons, et je ne vois pas en quoi l'Etat pourrait changer le fait que ce n'est pas encore le moment pour tel ou tel investissement. Certains investissement à long terme doivent prendre compte du fait qu'il vaut mieux attendre le haut de la courbe expodentielle pour investir.

&gt;Libre marché et santé (que fait on si le meilleur ratio qualité prix met en danger la vie des gens/ n'est pas suffisant pour aider le maximum de gens)

Le marché de la santé américain n'est pas libre. La FDA contrôle tout. Le nombre d'étudiants en médecine est contrôlé officieusement (les effets sur le prix des soins est incroyable). Enfin les industries américaines se font plumer par les Etats européens qui les obligent à payer un certain prix ce qui obligent ces industries à faire payer plus cher les américains pour être rentable. Inutile non plus dévoquer le nombre halucinant de monopole soutenu à ce niveau par les Etats-Unis.

Le meilleur rapport qualité prix ne peut mettre en danger la vie des gens. Tout simplement parce que la qualité par définition c'est sauver la vie des gens dans ce cas là. Donc quand on prend l'exemple américain, on a pas le meilleur rapport qualité prix. donc que faire pour améliorer ce ratio? arrêter de tout contrôler: aucune institution officiel, plus d'affssaps, plus de ministère de la santé, plus toutes ces institutions publics en monopoles qui font plus de 120 diapos à apprendre (je suis étudiant en médecine, pire cours de l'année...). Et à la place, un multitude d'institutions privées, qui essaient de gagner la meilleur réputation par le publics en ayant le meilleurs contrôles sur les soins et les médicaments.

Plus de contrôle sur les étudiants en médecines. Il nous en faut beaucoup beaucoup plus pour réduire les coûts.

Plus d'assurances en compétitions. Qui recruteront eux-même les médecins pour leur assurés.

Plus d'association caritatives pour tout ceux qui ne peuvent se payer une assurance.
Bref je peux continuer mais je pense que tu as compris: en meilleur rapport qualité/prix garanti par la réputations des hopitaux, des asssurances et des institutions privées de contrôles.

&gt;Est ce que tu pense que la libéralisation en cours de la Grèce, de l’Espagne, du Portugal, vont donné des super résultats? 

Elle complètement insuffisante et très mal faite. Demi-mesure comme d'hab, on risque de faire plus de bien que de mal du coup. C'est interréssant de de libéraliser si on réduit un peu les impôts et les réglementation stupides. Ce qu'il faut, c'est ça: [la TEM une nouvelle monnaie grec qu'est juste exempté de taxe puisque inexistante aux yeux de l'Etat et qui ne soutient donc pas ses projets ultra-nationalistes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTMXhSSOBSk) .
Libéralisation de la monnaie ça peut aussi être efficace, mais c'est aussi l'avantage de la diminution des taxes permettant de concentrer son argent sur des trucs vraiment utiles, pas des trucs décider n'importe comment par un Etat.

&gt;Est ce que tu pense réellement que l’impôt est une agression?

Oui. Peu importe comment tu le place, c'est une agression. Le don n'est pas une agression, l'impôt en est une.

Explain them that you are not native and you might have problems expressing yourself in German. 

Explain them that they are very loud and you cannot sleep even with earplugs. Ask them to lower their voices. 

Write a protocol afterwards about what happened, let it contain date and time and what happened during the talk (eg. she was offended, nice, threatened you, whatever). This will be handy when the dispute escalates. 

Wait a week and check their reaction. If the problem is solved now, talk again to them and thank them. 

If they are still too loud, talk again to them. Ask them again to lower their voices and write a second protocol. 

Wait another week. If they are still too loud, write a letter to the landlord. Explain them your situation and that you are required to wear earplugs while sleeping. Also add the protocols (as xerox or transcript), to show that you talked twice to them and waited a week in between. Sometimes neighbours quickly escalate their disputes and landlords have to engage in troll fights. 

Wait for a reaction of the landlord. They should talk to the ladies and send you a protocol (... we talked to Mrs. X and Mrs. Y last friday ...). 
Wait another week and see what happens. If nothing gets better, phone your landlord or visit their office. 

If your landlord does not help or do noting, look for a *Mieterschutzbund* or *Mieterverein* or *Mieterbund* in your town and talk to them.

*L'importance des investissements et la longueur des cycles nécessaires pour développer un nouvel appareil ont précipité le regroupement des industriels à travers des rachats et fusions. Ce mouvement est très visible pour les fabricants de cellules et moteurs, un peu moins pour les équipementiers.*

D'ailleurs, si les États européens (au passage rien à voir avec du nationalisme) se regroupent pour aider EADS/Airbus, c'est parce que les investissements sont trop importants pour un seul état, alors imaginer des investisseurs privés qui auraient la capacité et surtout la volonté d'investir là-dedans est un peu illusoire à mon humble avis.

*Aux États-Unis, si en 1940, il y avait 17 constructeurs dans l’aéronautique militaire américaine, depuis la fin du XXe siècle, ils n’étaient plus que trois*

Et dans le monde entier on constate ce mouvement : [plus de 2700 fusions et acquisitions](http://www.imaa-institute.org/statistics-mergers-acquisitions.html#M&amp;A_Ind_Aerospace&amp;Defense) depuis 1988 en aéronautique.

Le marché a essayé la concurrence, mais elle n'est plus adaptée devant l'évolution de la technologie.

Pour l'usb, il y a eu une guerre de format avec le FireWire, du coup, c'est comme quand deux constructeurs de métro faisaient deux stations l'une en face de l'autre : des investissements pour rien et au final un coût supérieur à celui résultant d'une planification étatique.

Why should 26 nations listen to their own population? Or why is Federalism a nightmare? I've indirectly answered both questions in the posts above, but you ignored my points, and started talking about ""democracy"".

&gt; Do you mean uninformed opinions based on preconceptions and FUD? You know that is what most of them are (in both sides of the issue).

Oh, I see. So you think people should only be allowed to vote if they are voting for the *right* party, or for the *right* choice, or only when they've heard the opinions that *you* want them to hear? All tyrants and dictators think that people would understand them if only they realised that they were making the *right* choices, that they were doing things for some *greater* good. 

You have to let people make their own decisions, even if those decisions turn out to be the wrong ones. Anything else is despotism. And that is the direction the EU is heading in. And you guys with the little EU flags are cheering them every step of the way. 

&gt; You live in a monarchy. One of you legislative bodies is hereditary, just like your head of state and you want to lecture about democracy? Come on, everything but that.

Not sure if you're trolling, or if you're just ignorant of the UK. The monarch has had no legislative, or executive power in the UK for a very long time. And the House of Lords cannot block legislation, nor can it propose legislation on its own. It can amend legislation, but it is subordinate to the house of commons. It is also mostly appointed, now, and not hereditary - just like the EU Commission. Unlike the EU Commission, the elected house can push new laws through the House of Lords, without their agreement, if need be. Also, unlike the Commission, the House of Lords has no executive power. 

&gt; EU democracy has much to improve, but so has the UK.

For the UK - only cosmetically, changing the head of state and the house of lords would make no difference to the way things were run. For the EU - as I have said repeatedly, the legislative and executive power in the EU (the Commission) is not accountable to the voting public. Therefore, the EU is an undemocratic institution, accountable to no one and furthering its own agenda, often at the expense of some of the constituent nation states.

Kind of like pretty much every other country in the world, or at least Europe. It is this tying of the individual's self-worth to that of a larger group - a nation, a political party, a football team - that is the core problem. It is a weakness that leaves them open for insults and offense because their source of pride and self-worth is out of their control. To counter this you get this kind of behavior.

People need to be able to take pride in something much closer to themselves - something they can control. It's well known that certain factors drive this mentality: When there's high unemployment or poverty, people feel helpless and unable to be independent so they seek other, more external sources to hitch their sense of pride to. Money, or wealth, can be part of the solution, but it doesn't guarantee it (see the US, or the various xenophobic reactions in Switzerland). The real source of this mentality is ingrained in humans in the form of fear of the unknown and the banding together in groups, and that's much harder to fight.

résumé? Nen sérieux là, tl;dr et j'ai pas honte de le dire ;). Je suis pas étudiant en éco, j'ai juste pas le temps de lire un truc à ce point éloigné de mes propres études :P

Les Etats européen c'est bien du nationalisme européen (oui le mot est pas adapté je sais pas comment ça s'appelle). ""Je suis fier de faire partie de l'europe qui construit airbus!"".

Plusieurs Etats qui se regroupent pour investir, en quoi est-ce différent de plusieurs investisseurs privées qui se réunissent pour investir? La volonté? Si elle est inexistante c'est que le marché n'est pas viable. Si elle tarde malgré tout à venir c'est que les Etats ont mis un frein à ce marché concurent, par ses taxes et ses réglementations.

&gt;Aux États-Unis, si en 1940, il y avait 17 constructeurs dans l’aéronautique militaire américaine, depuis la fin du XXe siècle, ils n’étaient plus que trois

Et dans le monde entier on constate ce mouvement : plus de 2700 fusions et acquisitions depuis 1988 en aéronautique.

Le marché a essayé la concurrence, mais elle n'est plus adaptée devant l'évolution de la technologie.

Et que c'est il passé entre temps? Encore et toujours, l'Etat a fait plus de taxes et de réglementations. Et puis en quoi est ce si mal? On est pas obligé d'en avoir 2000 des concurents. Mais plus de 2 ça serait mieux quand même... 

Le marché est beacoup plus adapté à l'évolution de la technologie que les Etats, je sais pas si j'ai vraiment besoin de justifier ça. Vu le nombre de conneries sur lees réglementation internet qu'on a sorti ces dernières années... T'appelles ça adaptés toi?

&gt;Pour l'usb, il y a eu une guerre de format avec le FireWire, du coup, c'est comme quand deux constructeurs de métro faisaient deux stations l'une en face de l'autre : des investissements pour rien et au final un coût supérieur à celui résultant d'une planification étatique.

Nen, le meilleur a triompher, et l'argent dépensé a ainsi permis d'en gagner beacoup plus dans les années à venir. Si l'Etat avait choisit, il aurait très certainelment prix un format moins efficace que celui décidé par le marché. Et pas seulement efficace au niveau transfert de données mais aussi au niveau facilité de production, ce sur quoi les Etats ont très peu de visions.

Not quite: you didn't provide arguments for the assumption that privatization is always better. I gave you a counterexample (US healthcare vs most European healthcare), that's enough to disprove such a blanket statement.

&gt;We also pay massively in taxes

So what? The healthcare budget can be clearly separated, and total spending per person is lower.

&gt;and they're involved in wars and have much more weapons and fatness than we do.

That might be relevant if the extra care for veterans required is significantly more than the saved expenses for casualties that never reach old age.

&gt;weapons and fatness

These are both lifestyle choices, and there's plenty of variety within Europe as well; nevertheless the difference is clear across the board.

&gt;Also, do notice that, per capita, at least Portugal, we're poorer, so it's not like we'd be able to afford it anyway.

If so, that will just ensure that you'll end up paying the same but receive much less healthcare. How is that an improvement?

&gt;if you were managing an hospital and had fixed pay by the state, [...]

That's a huge assumption. There are plenty of ways to organize healthcare that don't involve a soviet-style bureaucracy and lack of accountability.

&gt;Either only the public hospitals were available to everyone [...] or every hospital would have the same subsidies [...]

You're arguing against an imaginary bogeyman. There are plenty of combined systems between ""the ministry of health decides what you need"" and ""give up your money or give up your health"".

&gt;Isn't it?

No, it's a measure of inefficiency. Huge profits indicate huge imbalances between supply and demand.

&gt;There isn't nothing wrong with the train company if it presents profits

The thing is that our goal is not to guarantee the wellbeing of companies, but the wellbeing of the inhabitants of country. A company saying ""We're running a profit, everything is ok"" is the same as a state institution saying ""we're getting government funding, everything is ok"". Those statements say nothing about their effectivity.

&gt;That's still more efficient than to provide everything for everyone through taxes.

Again, you might want get a more nuanced view op the options.

&gt;That problem is meaningless if you're saving employment and making your economy more competitive and everyone is overall benefiting much more than they would if they had others more inefficient means of transportation which were unsustainable on their own and a net expense for society.

If, if, if...

&gt;If you know of a better alternative, present it.

Let's not move the goalposts here: the issue under discussion was whether privatization is always better.

true,back-in-black,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; Unfortunately reality is different from your fantasy. 

I wonder if you ever read your own links. From Wikipedia. 

&gt; Unlike the elected House of Commons, most new members of the House of Lords are appointed... While the House of Lords is unable unilaterally to prevent bills passing into law... its members can severely delay bills that they believe to be misguided.

None of that disagrees with what they said.

&gt; Or do you really think that those guys only sit there looking at each other?

No. They can make amendments to bills, but the Commons does not have to accept the amendments. So. Like I said, the Lords are effectively subordinate to the commons. 

&gt; Since until this moment you have failed to provide any valid points besides your rumblings about ""is not a democracy"" even thought it is a system more democratic than the one you have in your country, I can only conclude that your opinion is one more of those based on FUD and preconceptions.

My [""valid"" points](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/11qo1q/brexit_europe_loses_patience_with_london/c6ozq5k), if you want me to enumerate them, *yet again*. Are: 

* The Commission is unelected and wields executive and legislative power. It is not directly accountable to the voting EU populace, and actively discourages engagement with it, even through referendums. 

* The Commission has undermined democratically elected governments in both Greece and Italy, effectively replacing the premier of each nation when it looked like they were thinking of exiting the Euro. 

* The EU is marching toward a Federalist identity without the consent of the population of the constituent states. 

* The EU has irreparably damaged the UKs fisheries, propped up vested land interests with the CAP, and now intends to destroy the UKs financial services industry with new legislation. 

None of that is FUD, it is fact. Fact you seem unable to deal with, and so try to ignore. You haven't got any counter points to the points that I've made, instead you've made an incredibly weak attempt to try and show that the UK wasn't a democracy, including totally misunderstanding the political system you were talking about, and posting links in your own posts which illustrated that you were actually wrong!

&gt; Fun fact: if Roosevelt had listened to the popular opinion you would all be probably speaking German at this point. Sometimes the greater good does out-weight the ""populist"" opinions.

Yeah, this is the attitude that Britain used to have twenty or thirty years ago.

For instance, there's a whole chain of authority, from the individual supporter, to the people around them in the stadium, then supporters associations, then stadium management, then police, then the Serbian FA, then the government, and finally the general mass of the media or public pressure.

Imagine what goes through the head of the ones who didn't participate in the ""Riot"". I'm sure SD got a few hundred new votes because of the behaviour of the 20 retards in this video.

I have a friend who votes for a party like that. I certainly don't agree with her, but at the same time, i can imagine all the anger that she feels when she gets called a Whore for walking down the street. 

There are tons of reasons why muslims and immigrants behave like this. Their ""culture"" is far from the only one. Social and economic status affect it strongly aswell. 

The worst part about this is that, while it's not entirely their fault, muslims are doing a very good job in increasing the racism themselves. There are tons of bigots and there will always be racists. However, they should stop giving them firewood.
Also, the people voting for these parties also helps the extreme bigots and racists to feed their own egoes. It's a bad circle.

Just like an Australian journalist wrote in response to the ""Beheave those who insult islam"" signs in Sydney, that those muslims had now given fuel to every racist in the country.

This is not a fight they can ever win. And the more they try to fight it, the more they end up harming themselves and innocent muslims who gets dragged in the filth with them.

The denial of war crimes is the legacy of censorship under Milosevic, plus the failure of the education system to teach the younger generations the truth. The current history books are really retarded, there was a talk show just last week (in Serbian), where they quoted passages from the 8th grade history book, and the audience laughed because it was so stupid. But since there's no real effort by the political elite to update the education system (and the intelectual elite is very pissed off because of this), it will remain like this for some time. Basically, kids teach that Serbs were always the victims, that they always acted on the ""right"" side of history, and there is no emphasis at all on individual choices, but historical decisions are presented as collective.

Bottom line is, there is a problem, the relevant people know about it, but the decision makers don't give a fuck.

When an extremist political group (Obraz) is banned in Serbia for violating the consitution for hate speech, it goes unnoticed in foreign media because that doesn't make for a bombastic headline. Some hooligans boo and harrass a footbal player - Serbia is racist #1. 

Meanwhile, Golden dawn beats down immigrants, using any opportunity they gained with their political increase in power, France forcibly relocates their roma population and extremist groups go on anti-roma marches in countries all over.

The problem that does exist with a significant part of the population is nationalism, and in that people harbour grudges against nations from the balkans that have been at war with Serbia in recent history, even though they couldn't care less about someone who's from England, France or Japan, or the colour of their skin.",0,1350838078,null,0,false,0,c6ppjze,t3_11u7f2,t1_c6ppjze,t1_c6pmj7m,null,1430204016,13,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,13

* the Colosseum (check [this](http://www.the-colosseum.net/around/visit.htm) website for tons of info);
* St. Peter and the Vatican (word of advice: there is going to be a HUGE line to get in... if you wish to skip it and you don't mind to spend a bit more, check the tours organized by the ""opera romana pellegrinaggi"");
* The Roman Forum and the Vittoriano
* Piazza Navona and the Pantheon

If you have some spare time and you're feeling like you want to see something, I don't know, ""weirder"" you should definitely check this place:

* [Cripta dei cappuccini](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capuchin_Crypt)

Then just walk around the city center, for example, I love to get lost in the Rione Monti or in the street close to Campo de' Fiori and at sunset/sunrise (maybe after a night of drinks...) check the view from Gianicolo (sunrise) or Pincio (sunset) 
   
    
Now, coming to the drinks and dance part...

Most of the bars close to the city center are in Campo de' Fiori (more ""touristy"") and Trastevere... for beers my two favourite places are

* Ma che siete venuti a fa'
* Open Baladin

Moreover, if you're looking for some good shots, check the ""
Rivendita Libri Cioccolata e Vino"" (the precise address is Vicolo Dè Cinque, 11) a small bar in Trastevere where they serve their shots in chocolate glasses...

Unfortunately, you're not going to be in Rome for the weekend, but anyway there should still be people around, so just roam the streets, follow the crowd, befriend strangers and have a great night! 

As for the ""dancing"" part most of the bars kind of turn into dancing venues after a certain point and in the neighbourhoods I've already mentioned there are plenty of small places where you can go dancing (they mostly play top 40s and this kind of stuff). If you're more into more alterntive music, you should go to the S.Lorenzo neighborhood, but you'll probably need a cab to get there.

Finally, a couple of weeks ago I've made a google map for a Canadian friend visiting Rome, if you wish, you can take a look at it: [here](http://goo.gl/maps/hI7jj) it is!

Catalonia has indeed lots of debt (mainly due to the massive corruption), and the regional government there is applying extremely umpopular measures regarding austerity.

My personal comment is that, the results of the elections today don't surprise me at all, but the polls of the Catalonian elections, frighten me so badly, because the main party there, which is now on the government, seems to be about gaining more votes...",0,1350841099,null,0,false,0,c6pq9zf,t3_11u2ks,t1_c6pq9zf,t3_11u2ks,null,1430204369,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

* ['The first Welsh poet laureate'](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01ng26d)

* [A lecture from the London School of Economics about alternative economic cultures post-2008](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01n9yg1)

* [A programme about 'an isogloss, a kind of linguistic boundary line where accent and dialect changes.'](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01ljwm4)

* [Gardener's Question Time](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01nbt9n)

* ['What threat does a growing fundamentalist branch of Islam pose to Arab Spring countries?'](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01nb1sc)

* ['The Future of the Oven'](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01ng1tw)

There's also [Desert Island Discs](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/desert-island-discs/find-a-castaway), where prominent people explain their lives interspersed with the music tracks they'd want to take with them to a desert island, and [Last Word](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01nbt9s), with a series of ten minute obituaries for prominent or note-worthy people who have died this week. If it was a week-day, there would also be about five hours of excellent news coverage.

You're angry that it's refereed to as a crisis? I suggest you direct your anger towards your politicians who thought it a good idea to hand over your monetary system to a fundamentally flawed fiscal union (note: I am **NOT** against the Eurozone, but to think it could work with no real central oversight that can act in the best interests in the Euro was ridiculous).

If you don't like UK media sites then the best I can give you is the study 'Sovereign Credit Risk in the Eurozone' found in the World Economics, vol. 13 which states:

&gt;What is the current state of sovereign credit risk across the Eurozone? Does the recent **fiscal crisis** extend to other (non-Eurozone) countries? Is Greece the centre of the problem? How did the **current fiscal crisis** in the Euro area start? Who is behind it? How can it evolve? How can it be addressed? And, is a fiscally challenged country likely to want to leave the Eurozone? This article addresses these questions, argues that a fiscally weak country is better off in the Eurozone than outside it, and finds that a feasible policy tool can be a bailout associated with tough fiscal conditionality. It also shows that sovereign credit risk adjustment in the Eurozone can happen, using various measures, but not without ""fiscal pain"".

From the end of WW2 until about 10 or 15 years ago, the Franco-German relationship was the core of integration due to population and economic parity. Even when the governments in Paris and Berlin were of opposing parties, their leaders recognized the necessity for unity if Europe was going to move forward. They really were the leaders, setting a direction for the rest of Europe to move forward. For decades it was this partnership that drove Europe. That has now changed

France and Germany are no longer equals. Germany's economy and population are significantly larger than France's. Germany is now the de facto leader of the EU due to its strong economic credentials, which is something France lacks. France is not in the same position as Italy, Spain, or Greece, obviously, but it also isn't a Germany or Finland. France has some other things going for it though. It is unanimously recognized as a great power. It has an extensive diplomatic network second only to the United States, is a nuclear weapons state, has close relations to many of its former colonies, a powerful armed forces, one of only three blue-water navies (the US and UK being the other two), and a strong desire to remain a global power. These are things that Germany generally lacks.

Because the EU is more of an economic union than a political union, Germany is now more significant because of its economic strength. In foreign policy and security policy, France still tends to be more powerful than Germany.

The only argument for independence that matters is that the majority of the Catalan people want it.

Of course the outward unity had always been under stress due to e.g. cultural differences but, until now, France and Germany had kept their disputes private. Presumably, because their leaders shared a vision for the future of a Europe where local cultures would converge.

Now that Hollande disagrees so openly with Germany, we may expect a surge of geographical politics of the kind Britain has shown since Thatcher.

It is bold, because Hollande is old enough (he worked for Mitterrand) to know that private dispute and outward unity has always been the core of the French-German alliance.
By breaking that understanding, he is now entering new territory.

It is risky, because the current crisis leaves little time to reorganize diplomatic agreements. 

I think you confuse bold and risky with unexpected or surprising. Clearly this turn of events is neither.

The problem is that a lot of immigrants (or even people that were born here but with another cultural background in their family) actually take offence if you would put them into the ""German"" category. You've got your bad experience with Germans putting you into categories? Well, every German has the same experiences the other way around. It's just impossible to know if somebody is fine with being put into the German category or not. 

And that's the reason why one wouldn't consider the Indian guy from my example German. Because he obviously has another cultural background and you just don't know if it's offending to not give a damn about his culture and put him into the German category or into the India one (I think category sounds really offensive, by the way. That's not intended). Especially if they speak the language of said nation (Indian in that example) and you can't even be sure that they consider themselves German. 

I don't even want to deny that people actually think in those categories (Schubladendenken is probably the better German word) but couldn't it be that people (and I mean educated people here. I'm very sure some people actually take those categories very serious in a mean way) are just trying to not force their culture onto you and therefore make those categories in the first place? I kind of think like you and the first think I'd do if I immigrate into another country would be applying for a passport as soon as possible since I do t give a crap about my heritage. But I'm in my home country and I'm just not sure if that's how I'd feel if I'm actually emigrated or if I'd like to see people still considering me German. 

That's the thought I've got when I do that. 

What you could actually consider racism is that most people only do that with Turks. Nobody gives a crap if you're talking to a east European/Russian or Asian guy. I remember when we were eating ramen with class mates and the half Vietnamese guy was so skilled with the chop sticks that it actually hurts when he pinched you with them. Then we all realised that his father is from Vietnam and we felt dump for being surprised. 

Any ideas on that? Because I think that's a lot weirder than your categories. ",0,1350853039,null,0,false,0,c6ptdph,t3_11sna7,t1_c6ptdph,t1_c6pst6p,null,1430205818,2,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,2

Certainement pas pour être monté sur le toit de l'église et y avoir déployé le drapeau Algérien en crachant leur haine de la France. La nuance est hautement importante dans le débat idéologique (sans compter que la mosquée de Poitiers n'est encore qu'un chantier, même si déjà utilisée pour prier en toute illégalité donc).

Ensuite, si je mets ça sur le dos de la génération 68 (je ne parle pas de cette profanation révolutionnaire, mais bel et bien d'occupations d'églises, dont la fameuse, ces derniers mois), c'est qu'aujourd'hui ce sont eux qui sont aux manettes et à tous les postes de décision depuis maintenant quelques décennies. Ce sont eux qui ont profité et abusé d'une société riche léguée par nos arrière-grands-parents et grands-parents à la sueur de leur travail, et ce sont eux qui aujourd'hui entendent nous imposer leurs choix : 

* L'immigration, afin de palier le vieillissement du baby-boom et la natalité naturelle trop faible , mais aussi baisser les salaires et contenir l'inflation (cf. rapports de l'OCDE à ce sujet, dont le calcul du NAIRU, pour comprendre le chômage en France), car ce sont essentiellement des rentiers aujourd'hui, et l'inflation écorne les patrimoines et revenus qui ne sont pas liés au travail
* L'islam, parce que c'est lié à l'immigration, et aux contrats avec les pétromonarchies, parce que pour des raisons d'alignement sur la politique de l'empire US, la carte du pétrole russe a été écartée en France (contrairement à l'Allemagne).
* Les aides sociales plus généreuses avec les étrangers qu'avec nous qui les finançons et devons encore payer pour y avoir accès, mais aussi lorsque les Français qui travaillent en conditions précaire n'ont pas droit au logement social alors que les étrangers sont largement prioritaires. L'hébergement d'urgence qui va à 79,7 % à des étrangers dont 77,9% d'Africains, dans des chambres d'hôtel 3 étoiles à 150 euros la nuit en moyenne, tandis que nos SDF Français continuent à dormir dehors dans l'indifférence.
* L'AME qui génère une immigration de soins, où les gens ne viennent que pour se faire soigner gratuitement, profitant de l'ATA au passage, qui leur garanti avec quelques autres aides sociales un revenu proche du SMIC pour un célibataire, sans travailler et en étant hébergé.
* L'ASPA, qui garanti à des étrangers n'ayant jamais travaillé ni cotisé en France de toucher une retraite française de ~750 € par mois, soit plus qu'une retraite d'ouvrier qui se sera usé toute sa vie à la chaîne !
* Les aides de la CAF, qui font qu'une femme d'origine étrangère célibataire avec 3 ou 4 enfants aura un logement social et entre 2000 et 3000 euros d'aides par mois sans travailler, alors que les couples de Français qui n'ont pas droit à grand chose font des gamins au compte goutte de peur de ne pouvoir subvenir à leurs besoins et de ne pas pouvoir les éduquer correctement. C'est d'ailleurs grâce à ça qu'on a tellement de fraudes liées à la polygamie, avec des musulmans qui tournent à plusieurs dizaines de milliers d'€ par mois d'aides en déclarant leurs enfants de plusieurs femmes (cf. actualité et les quelques procès à ce sujet).

Tout cela parce qu'ils (la génération 68) veulent continuer à vivre leur retraite aussi largement qu'ils ont vécu le reste de leur vie, à la sueur de notre travail, et sans tenir compte des conditions économiques nettement dégradées par la faute de leur gestion pitoyable depuis des décennies. Et sans en avoir rien à faire des conditions de vie socialement dégradées dans lesquelles ils nous placent. Ils oublient une chose cependant, rien n'est acquis dans ce monde, et notre génération arrivant au pouvoir, ils pourront faire une croix sur leurs retraites, nous ne payerons pas pour les pourris qui nous auront trahi, et nous ferons ce qui aurait du être fait depuis bien longtemps en inversant les flux migratoires.

Sauf si entre-temps, ils ont continué à laisser le robinet de l'immigration grand ouvert (plus aucun contrôle depuis l'élection de Flanby), tout en facilitant l'accès à la naturalisation (qui n'est pas censée être un facteur aidant à l'intégration, mais qui est censée être son aboutissement), et en donnant le droit de vote aux étrangers (nouvel électorat du PS qui a abandonné les classes populaires et ouvrières, sur les recommandations de leur think tank Terra Nova), et en déléguant toujours plus de pouvoir à une Europe fédérale, histoire d'éloigner toujours plus le pouvoir des mains du peuple et des nations ([comme l'a très justement dénoncé Oskar Freyssinger face à Daniel Cohn Bendit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZoF__ZpR3g), DCB dont on admirera le respect pour la démocratie).

Alors en effet, s'ils poussent la perversion jusque là, le peuple de France aura été spolié de ses droits les plus élémentaires de décider de son avenir, de comment il entend vivre et avec qui, et il y aura alors fort à craindre qu'il ne se déroule en France une guerre ethnique de reconquête, comme l'histoire nous enseigne qu'il y a eu partout ailleurs.

Je rappelle que tout ce qu'a réclamé Génération Identitaire à travers sa manifestation pacifique, c'est un référendum sur l'immigration et la construction des mosquée, rien d'autre. C'est à dire que l'État demande au peuple son avis, il faudra m'expliquer où est le fascisme ou le nazisme dans une demande pacifique et démocratique, à moins d'avoir un pois-chiche à la place du cerveau et d'être endoctriné jusqu'à la moelle.

C'est le droit le plus légitime d'un peuple que de réclamer à décider de son avenir sur des points aussi importants lorsqu'il est confronté à la menace d'une immigration de peuplement, véritable colonisation inversée.

J'ai l'impression d'être à la fin des années 30, lorsque les nazis s'apprêtaient à déferler sur l'Europe, et que les gauchistes étaient soit alliés aux nazis (pacte germano-soviétique, à de rares exceptions près, les communistes ont lutté contre l'armée puis contre la résistance, avant de la rejoindre en 41), soit collaboraient et ce jusqu'à l'occupation en se défaussant en votant les plein pouvoir à un vieux héros sénile qui a pris sur lui la charge de cette honte. Sans parler de tous les gauchistes qui se sont enfuis vers le Maghreb (cf. Paquebot Massilia, etc.).

En ces temps troublés, c'était déjà l'extrême droite qui la première a rejoint les rangs de la résistance et qui a fait le plus pour qu'elle se mette en place et soit efficace. Mais pour savoir cela, il faut avoir ouvert un livre d'histoire, et non pas un livre de propagande revisitée que l'Éduc Naze impose au grand dam des historiens.

Mon grand-père arrive au crépuscule de sa vie, après avoir combattu contre les nazis et lutté pour la France toute sa vie, et aujourd'hui il n'a qu'un seul regret, c'est que ses camarades soient morts pour qu'on se fasse trahir à ce point et que tout se termine ainsi.",1,1350858788,null,0,1350874075,0,c6pumgv,t3_11sppp,t1_c6pumgv,t1_c6pn3uk,null,1435676558,0,false,france,t5_2qhjz,0

En Corse, aujourd'hui, la violence est divisée en trois sous-genres étonnamment distincts: les petits délits, comme partout ailleurs en France, le terrorisme nationaliste, plus spécifique, et la main mise de la mafia sur le patrimoine immobilier et le secteur tertiaire, beaucoup plus grave et beaucoup plus particulière. L'erreur que fait l'article, c'est de mettre la violence nationaliste et la violence mafieuse dans le même panier, alors que, justement, les deux auraient plutôt tendance à s'opposer, tant dans le mode opératoire que sur le ""fond."" Il va directement à l'encontre des intérêts du système mafieux de couper les ponts avec le continent, de même qu'il n'est pas dans les intérêts des nationalistes de fonder une nation indépendante morcelée par des luttes de clans et des vendettas à n'en plus finir.

Concernant le mode opératoire, la mafia est la plus meurtrière et la plus terrifiante. C'est eux qui vont tuer les gens dans les cafés en plein jour.

2. There are reactor designs that are supposed to be fueld by the waste of current nuclear plants (e.g. [LFTR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LFTR)). Some people say they are not viable by design, others say that's just because we don't invest enough in research. I guess you'd have to be an expert to have a well-grounded opinion on this.

3. Nuclear waste loses most of its radioactivity after a few hundred years. After that, it's still not anywhere near safe, but it's much easier to store it safely. Fresh waste produces heat, which makes it hard to find a container that doesn't corrode away fast.

When the wars started, people from Serbia were leaving for many reason, some because they didn't think they'll have a future there anymore, some to avoid the draft (however, since 1992, the borders were closed for most males) and some for economic reasons. There are also millions of Serbs living outside Serbia, and many became refugees.

I am not against letting the Catalans decide their independence, but it annoys me that people try to base it on such historical fallacies. This is just as naïve as the ideology behind the ""one and uniform Spain"" that you seem to be countering.

It would take ages to discuss old history and it would lead to nothing. Let's just consider this: Catalans voted massively in favour of the Spanish Constitution that recognized their autonomy within a Spanish state in 1978. Catalonia enjoys a great degree of autonomy, Catalan culture is actively sponsored, all public education is in Catalan only with no opt-out right, and public officers are required to speak Catalan. The first opinion poll that showed a majority of Catalans backing independence appeared only a couple of months ago. Still no elections have resulted in a majority of parties in the parliament backing independence (although this will probably change in a few months). 

So even after 40 years of Francoist dictatorship Catalans still believed they could be a part of Spain without compromising their identity, and were given the chance to develop it fairly well. If you changed your mind over these 35 years it's ok, but don't expect me to buy the ""poor oppressed people"" Braveheart thing.

PD: The Roman province of Hispania included the current territory of Catalonia (even when no such thing as Spain or Catalonia existed yet), and it is obvious that the natural border of the geopolitical unit commonly known as ""Iberian Peninsula"" lies on the Pyrinees.

we weren't the only ones who didn't want communism, in fact Britain was part of keeping communism from spreading during the split of Berlin.  and look around...is communism really doing anything to save the world? just watched an awfully good documentary on North Korea and China is really pushing along, aren't they...?

&gt;Success in life is determined by forces outside our control

is ""forces"" suppose to mean the government or some kind of higher power?  sounds a bit like the latter. 

I found it odd that in a country filled with Christians (78 percent according to 'The Pew Forum'), 62% disagreed with that in the US. this brings up the question, for me at least, how many people were surveyed, and where did they survey?  because if 'forces' was suppose to mean divine power, i can tell you where they probably did NOT survey in the US.  

Also, are we gauging success on the idea of a promotion at work or becoming a better person?

Edit:  Maybe i am looking too far into it but ""Outside forces"", to me, is extremely vague terminology hence why i had a problem with this part of the Survey in the first place.  Are we talking about a factory closing/ opening, inflation, economic upturn, or economic downfall, good luck, religious safety net, a housing market boost, a new leader, new policy etc.? All of which are very different, all of which provide very different openings and closings in ones life.  that is all.

But, what I'm telling you is that despite how *you* think about people of foreign descent, there is a very significant portion of the population (maybe it's only a minority, but if so, it's a significant minority) that doesn't think that way.  It may be true that the OP may only interact with relatively educated people.  (That's also true of me, btw, but I've heard casual racism (even against ""east European/Russian or Asian guys"") even in my work place.  Much of it, I only understood because I understand German very well.  And, I work with *highly* educated people.)  But, she will probably also have to interact with hairdressers, hotel managers, (God forfend) policemen, bank tellers, bakery ladies, store clerks, gorcery store mangers, etc, etc ,etc.  Some of these people will be the nicest people you've ever met.  Some will even go through this sort of Schuhbladendenken and STILL be the nicest people you've ever me.  But, others will treat you coldly (compared to the German customers before or after you) or treat you like an idiot just for being an Outsider.

You sound interested in spending some time in another country/culture.  You sound like you would enjoy it, and you sound like you could learn from it.  I think you should try it.  To really get something out of it, I advise you stay for a long time--at least two years, if possible, some kind of open-ended commitment--to make sure you really commit to the culture.  But, be open.  Maybe you will see the sorts of things I'm talking about.  The only foreign country that I've lived in (but I've lived here a long time) is Germany.  However, I'm pretty sure this sort of subconscious, instantaneous stereotyping is a fundamental element of human nature, so you will see it everywhere.  


But, that doesn't mean it's a good thing.  I don't know how you combat this sort of thinking, but I do know its consequences on the foreigners in your midst.  One of which is often the sort of knee-jerk reaction that you describe when someone of foreign descent gets upset when you describe them as German.  They've felt rejected by German society in hundreds of tiny ways so they've clung to their own heritage, and they are wary when someone suddenly seems inclusive (why are they suddenly so nice to me? What do they want from me? etc).  Again, it probably happens everywhere, but maybe people will be more tolerant/understanding if they are aware of it.

Aucun rapport. Donc les pouvoirs français des années 60-70
(manifestement infiltrés par de dangereux intégristes musulmans !) auraient fondé leur politique pétrolière en rapport avec l'Islam. N'importe quoi, ça n'a aucun sens. Tu parles du pétrole russe, peut-être a-t-il été écarté parce qu'on était en pleine guerre froide, et non pas pour faire plaisir aux pétromonarchies ? Quel est le rapport avec l'Islam dans cette histoire ? Aucun.

Tes autres points, c'est simplement ""ah les arabes volent le pain des français !"". C'est faux. L'immigration rapporte 12 milliards d'euros par an à l'Etat. Tu vas me sortir l'étude opposée de Laulan d'après laquelle l'immigration couterait en fait 30 milliards. Sauf que l'étude de Lalan gonfle les dépenses en intégrant des choses bénéficiant à tous les français et pas seulement les immigrés (infrastructure, sécurité notamment). Chacun voit midi à sa porte. En attendant, les jeunes immigrés actifs cotisent pour la retraite alors qu'ils sont très peu à en bénéficier. De plus, les aides sociales ne sont plus élevées pour les immigrés (il n'y a pas de case ""cochez ici si vous êtes étranger et touchez 50% de plus qu'un français"", c'est n'importe quoi). Enfin, quid des 600 milliards d'évasion fiscale, selon l'enquête d'Antoine Peillon ? Sont-ils le fait des immigrés ? Ou bien parle-t-on de français blancs, chrétiens, ""bien de chez nous"" ? Ce sont sûrement des soixante-huitards, eux aussi, ou des communistes staliniens ?

Le reste n'est que clichés resassés, des vieux poncifs du FN des années 80, avec le soixante-huitard qui se cache sous ton lit et qui viendra te lire du Sartre si tu finis pas tes légumes.

- For example we have very car-centric cultures. If you talk with a friend about a common friend you both did not see for 20 years, the first question will be what he drives, as it is the No. 1 sign of success of failure. Interesting how living a few years in Western Euruope suddenly the car stops being part of one's identity...

- We tend not to be religious but still dislike homosexuals mostly on a disgust basis i.e. for lack of masculinity/toughness.

- We stopped trusting in the welfare state since they pay so low pensions and suchlike, you better save up for your pension in EE and while healthcare is theoretically ""free"" you still have to bribe the doctor, so basically the major functions of the welfare state in EE are pretty much non-functional and nobody really trusts in it anymore. So there is a widespread anti-tax sentiment, as you better off saving for your own pension or for the bribe to the doctor.

- Success in life is determined by forces outside our control? In EE the question looks weird, because it is mostly about how fair life or the system is, but nobody really expects it to be fair, and people are pretty much beyond wishing it was so, so it just sounds weird. I think most people can't really even imagine a fair life here. Rich and politically connected people vs. everybody else is such a different class, nobody really expects everybody who is not of the elite not to struggle.

- Similarly the whole question of what is important, freedom or nobody is in need, sounds like a weird, moot point in EE. As it is basically about the state, but here the state is pretty much just a bunch of gangsters outside the people's control, so nobody really believes the state would pursue either freedom or equality honestly.

- Most old people generally thing their culture is inferior with regard to WE but superior to other EE countries. Most young people think their country is worst - this is an international phenomenon, young people very often hate their own country almost everywhere, at least it is the case in EE, USA, UK, Italy.

En l'occurrence, très peu des soixante-huitards étaient chrétiens, c'était surtout des gens d'extrême-gauche et de gauche, athées et anti-cléricaux. Les mêmes qui aujourd'hui embrassent l'islam parce que ça mine le catholicisme en France, ce qui était clairement [le but recherché par la franc-maçonnerie pour parvenir à manipuler le peuple](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9uBgkS8LTc).

Il y avait aussi [des patrons comme Bouygues](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OSwj_PTKYA), qui avaient besoin d'une main d'œuvre pas cher sur la durée, ce qui impliquait de mettre les manutentionnaires Français en concurrence, et ils ont donc milité pour le regroupement familial à cet effet (à l'époque, les communistes faisaient des ratonnades pour défendre les ouvriers).

L'immigration sert clairement de variable d'ajustement au [NAIRU](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taux_de_ch%C3%B4mage_n%27acc%C3%A9l%C3%A9rant_pas_l%27inflation), qui est un contre-sens total d'un point de vue économique, mais qui est tout de même appliqué en France depuis le début des grandes migrations justement (concept datant des années ~75, s'inscrivant dans le cadre du regroupement familial, etc.).

L'immigration sert également à compenser la faible natalité naturelle qui n'est en France que de 1,8 enfants par femme. La raison est que la génération baby boom arrive à la retraite, et qu'on ne sera pas assez d'actifs pour tout financer, alors ils importent pour garantir leur confort, sauf que n'étant pas en situation de plein emploi, ces arrivages créent de la précarité, qui amplifie la précarité déjà existante. Il n'y a pas création mais destruction de richesse, et création de toujours plus de pauvres, toujours plus pauvres.

&gt; Donc les pouvoirs français des années 60-70 (manifestement infiltrés par de dangereux intégristes musulmans !) auraient fondé leur politique pétrolière en rapport avec l'Islam.

Non, c'est venu par la suite, progressivement imposé par les pétromonarchies, ou plutôt, en arrosant certains politiques et grands chefs d'entreprises Français. Mon oncle a été arrosé de la sorte, en échange de « petits arrangements », c'était à chaque fois des cadeaux somptueux alors qu'il n'était que cadre Moyen-Orient auprès d'une multinationale française. Quand un politique « se rend au Qatar », il ne va pas juste y serrer des mains, il va y chercher des mallettes de billets, en échange de… De quoi à ton avis ?

&gt; ""ah les arabes volent le pain des français !""

Trouve une seule fois le mot arabe dans mon argumentation.

&gt; C'est faux. L'immigration rapporte 12 milliards d'euros par an à l'Etat.

Si l'immigration rapportait tant, il y longtemps que la France serait riche. Où sont donc passés les milliers de milliards accumulés et dont on n'a pas vu la couleur ?

Plus sérieusement, le rapport en question est complètement bidon, il a été fait par un petit groupe de 5 universitaires de Lille et ne prend rien en compte, il fait un instantanée *Dépenses - Recettes* en ne se concentrant que sur la part des immigrés légaux (aucun compte de l'immigration illégale) qui travaillent (aucun compte du travail au noir) ou en considérant un taux de chômage ridiculement faible (5,94%), et il ne tient aucun compte du vieillissement des populations et de leur impact sur le système des retraites et de santé.

Il ne prend pas en compte la quote-part au financement des infrastructures, car il faut bien les loger, construire des maisons, les relier à l'électricité, l'eau, le chauffage, le gaz, construire des routes, agrandir les centrales nucléaires, bétonner la France, dépolluer l'eau, mettre leurs enfants à l'école, subventionner des associations, embaucher des profs, des infirmiers, des médecins, des policiers, etc. et tout ça n'est pas gratuit, c'est même ce qui coûte le plus cher dans un État.

De plus, le rapport en question ne considère même pas le fait que le gros des sommes dépensées par les étrangers proviennent des aides sociales, il n'y a donc pas création de richesses.

Jean-Paul Gourevitch a chiffré le coût de l'immigration à 30,4 milliards d'euros (49 milliards d'euros de recettes - 79,4 milliards d'euros de dépenses)

Yves-Marie Laulan estime quant à lui le coût de l'immigration à 36 milliards d’euros par an.

Maurice Allais (Prix Nobel d'économie 1988) a quant à lui calculé qu'il fallait consacrer une épargne quatre fois supérieure au salaire annuel d'un immigré juste pour construire les équipements (école, logement, hôpital...) dont il a besoin, charge relevant en France de la collectivité, à multiplier par le nombre de personne étrangère au sein du foyer familial. Et si ma mémoire est bonne, il avait estimé à presque 80 milliards d'euros par an le coût de l'immigration à l'époque (et elle a nettement augmenté depuis).

&gt; En attendant, les jeunes immigrés actifs cotisent pour la retraite alors qu'ils sont très peu à en bénéficier.

Lesquels ? Ceux qui sont au chômage ?

&gt; De plus, les aides sociales ne sont plus élevées pour les immigrés

Va demander un logement social en étant un couple Français, on te place sur une liste d'attente de plus de 3 ans, tandis qu'à côté tu vois tout un quartier résidentiel HLM se monter, tu espères que tu auras ta place, mais non, tu vois des familles africaines fraîchement débarquées en France en prendre possession.

Montre moi le nombre de familles françaises qui font de nombreux enfants ? Très peu, parce qu'on nous a inculqué depuis tout jeune à ne pas en faire tant qu'on ne pouvait pas les assumer, et à les éduquer. Alors que les étrangers qui arrivent n'ont pas cette éducation, et ils en font énormément (il suffit d'aller assister aux cérémonies qui décerne des médailles aux familles nombreuses pour le voir, j'habite face à ma mairie).

[Une femme célibataire logée en HLM, 4 enfants reçoit 2000 € par mois](http://imgur.com/j6925), sans même avoir à travailler, et sans tenir compte d'autres aides qui viennent s'ajouter.

&gt; quid des 600 milliards d'évasion fiscale, selon l'enquête d'Antoine Peillon ? Sont-ils le fait des immigrés ? Ou bien parle-t-on de français blancs, chrétiens, ""bien de chez nous"" ?

À moins qu'il ne s'agisse surtout des manipulations des grandes multinationales étrangères, celle-là même qui veulent un mondialisme et favorisent l'immigration tout en délocalisant là où tout est moins cher, mais qui en retour n'en supportent pas les coûts sociaux ? Toutes ces sociétés qui ont des sièges sociaux dans les paradis fiscaux ou dans des pays à fiscalité arrangeante, et qui font de l'optimisation fiscale abusive pour tricher sur leur bilan afin de payer le moins possible ?

&gt; Le reste n'est que clichés resassés, des vieux poncifs du FN des années 80

Tes arguments sont bidons, même pas creusés, tu n'as fait aucun effort que servir la soupe idéologique multiculturelle habituelle. Ne viens pas me donner des leçons, ou alors montre-moi en quoi l'immigration de masse nous a été bénéfique, montre-moi les milliers de milliards qu'on aurait du gagner avec ces plus de 20 millions d'étrangers (en ne prenant seulement que les deux dernières générations en compte), montre-moi en quoi le vivre-ensemble fonctionne, montre-moi en quoi on a gagné dans nos vies de tous les jours, nos traditions, nos valeurs, etc.

Parce que free qui détruit les monopoles du telecom en France ça a été créer par l'Etat?

Si les états les avaient pas empêcher les fusions dont tu parles auraient, à long terme, permis la faillite de ces entreprises par l'émergence de nouveaux concurents.

En fait je crois que là on est pas d'accord c'est que moi je considère qu'à partir du moment où il n'y a pas d'état et de régulation, l'émergence de la concurence est beaucoup beaucoup plus facile. Ce sont les lois, décidées par l'état qui maintiennent les monopoles privées en places. Ca demande aussi du temps et de l'entreprenariat de la part de la population, mais ça c'est un question d'éducation plus qu'autre chose.

Autre désaccord, le droit de vote ne dirige pas 100% d'une entreprise public, et très loin de là! Le droit de vote, c'est un droit de vote des partis qui vont mettre en place leurs directeurs favoris, mais c'est pas la population qui va élir le président de la SNCF ou des collecteurs d'impôt. Le truc super indirect. Est ce que tu sais quel directeur ton candidat soutenait il? Et même si tu le savais, est-ce que cela aurait vraiment pu faire changer ton vote? Après tous la démocratie tu fais le pour et le contre de chaque candidat. Si la moitié ou plus des directeurs soutenus par ton candidat (maire, président, etc) sont en accord avec tes idées, il en reste une minorité que tu n'auras pas choisi...

Mais pour un monopole privée, c'est différent. Si tu as réellement une demande pour tel ou tel services, ou produit ou prix, la concurence émergera forcément (pourvu que l'état n'est pas tout bloquer avec ses lois). Et au final ça fera plus d'heureux, car même la minorité qui veut un certains type de service très particulier pourra y prétendre.

&gt;Pourquoi est ce que les deux feraient face à des problèmes économiques au final ? Au contraire, c'est rarement les problèmes économiques qui font tomber les monopoles privés, mais bien les états.

Sauf que ce sont les états qui les ont mis en place. Donc au final je vois pas l'avantage d'un état qui régule tout derrière. Sans eux ils n'y aurait pas de problème au départ.

&gt;La concentration du capital est le principal défaut de ce système : les richesses ont une tendance

concentration des richesses ne veut pas dire monopole. 5000 entreprises qui en deviennent 20, ça reste de la compétition, pas un monopole. C'est le système qui est fait comme ça. Il faut que les entreprises qui fournissent de mauvais services crèvent. Et du coup oui, il y a concentration des richesses. Mais sans Etat on garde quand même une certaine concurence. Par exemple pour la construction d'ordinateurs, il y a eu une concentration massive des richesses, il n'y a plus beaucoup de constructeurs par rapport à il y a quelques années, mais la concurence est toujours très présente, preuve en est le rapport qualité prix de nos ordis aujourd'hui :)",0,1350901650,null,0,false,0,c6q2rol,t3_11r1b1,t1_c6q2rol,t1_c6ptup0,null,1430210369,1,false,france,t5_2qhjz,1

this is a real key point. I know tons of ""Ausländer"" who's family actually have lived here for two or three generation, but now  choose to be ""Ausländer"" first because they have never been accepted as normal Germans (this is the reason why so many for example educated turkish immigrant return to Turkey to study after school, they always have been ""der/die Türke their whole life in Germay). I totally understand where they are coming from, it is annoying when your name or grandparent's home  country is your defining trait. It is annoying when people bring up stuff that happens in your grandparent's home country and ask you about that stuff like you are the ambassador. It's a perfectly normal reaction to feel like you are not a part of regular German society after a while of being treated like you are still a Ausländer who happens to speak perfect German and happens to have lived here all his life. There is not much you can do about it. Have a foreign name and migrant parents or grandparents and often that is what you become. It happened with me too. Even at 22, not having my Ausländer father around, living a perfectly German life, I drop that my dad is from the States and my english name and I'm automatically ""der Ami"". As I said further above, it doesn't hurt be, but it alienates me from a real German identity and I can totally see how it drives some people out of Germany in the end.

If there is a higher cost associated with makeing someone redundant then a company, especially a smaller one, will think twice before hiring since it must set aside extra resources in order to cover potential costs.

For example, according to wikipedia, [In Spain, for example, such employees are entitled to 45 days redundancy pay per year worked.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_security) If this is correct then a small/medium sized company undertaking a new project without any certainty of future work is not going to take on a worker - why would it?

Nobody says ""learn German or gtfo"" in real life, at least nobody with more than basic education. It's much more about the question whether one's own cultural identity should carry over and enrich the culture in Germany or some form of assimilation should take place.

There is an undeniable need to integrate foreigners to provide everybody with e.g. a common language, a common understanding of the law and common interest in maintaining the country itself. When I see people living here for twenty years and not speaking a word of German it makes my heart bleed but mostly for them. You have to live a very isolated life like that which does the opposite of enriching culture. Nobody should forbid people from speaking their own language between them or in their home, it's just about the ability to also understand and speak German to a certain degree. From personal experience 99% of foreigners make an effort to integrate, playing in local football clubs, volunteering, simply hanging out with Germans and learning the language. I really don't think these ideas of enforcing integration should be labeled as racism. That's a term FAR too extreme for this, I mean it also includes free German courses available to anyone etc.

About moving to Germany I can tell you: with university education and speaking German well you should have zero trouble. Skin colour alone will make people curious but that's about it. When people ask where you're from they mean no harm. Old people ask because they rarely met people from other countries during their first 40 years here and younger people ask because they are genuinely interested. It's nice to have a friendly exchange about cultural differences and you can always profit from other people's experience. The only thing to think about might be to avoid these very rare areas where the NPD actually has some part of the vote and maybe the more dubious parts of the bigger cities like Berlin or Frankfurt. To be honest, I wouldn't exactly move to some parts of Berlin as a German for fear of being harassed over my heritage either, this kind of thing exists everywhere and is actually not that bad in Germany compared to other countries (from my experience France is WAY worse).

edit: just read you're from down under. LOL you'll be the most beloved person here. People will love you accent and Australia is really one of those countries for which there are close to none bad misconceptions in circulation.

Ceux qu'on appelait péjorativement les *pipis*, les *christos* et qu'on raillait parce qu'ils étaient catholiques à un moment où la France se déchristianisait progressivement, à qui on réservait les basses besognes, déjà trop basanés pour s'intégrer. Et aujourd'hui tu déclares la guerre à d'autres qui ont fait comme nos grand-pères (eh oui le mien aussi était italien).

La France n'est pas *chez toi*, ce n'est pas une possession qui serait la propriété d'un groupe culturel ou ethnique. Ce n'est pas à l'Etat de décider quelle culture est la bonne, quelle culture doit être détruite. Il y a des règles de vie commune, elles sont appliquées à tous, peu importe leur origine, sans discrimination. Les musulmans ont droit à leurs lieux de culte, l'immense majorité d'entre ne revendiquent pas une ""islamisation"" de la France, ils ne veulent pas établir la shariah, ils veulent simplement un endroit où prier en paix. Quant à la minorité intégriste surexposée par TF1 et consorts, comme dans tous les groupes, il y a des fondamentalistes extrèmistes, et la loi nous protège déjà de ceux là (comme elle nous protège des chrétiens intégristes et des identitaires qui viennent détériorier une mosquée en chantier).

Les zidentitaires revendiquent une culture locale, régionale, le provençal, le niçois, le breton, que sais-je, alors que ces cultures régionales ont été écrasées par la centralisation qui voulait l'unification de la nation sous la même identité. Et maintenant vous voulez faire pareil, bonjour le paradoxe, vous détenez LA culture, LA seule identité qui vaille, et tous devraient s'y plier. Rien ne vous empêche de vous organiser et vous rassembler pour perpétuer votre identité, votre culture, au contraire, organisez des cours, des visites de lieux historiques, des ateliers de dialectes locaux, très bien ! Mais pourquoi vouloir détruire la culture que d'autres ne partagent pas avec vous ? Pour ce qui est des comportements antirépublicains, les lois sont là pour nous protéger, qu'elles restent aculturelles et laïques et cessons de pointer du doigt les autres.

Je rejette l'enrobage soi-disant culturel des identitaires. Pour moi ce n'est qu'un habillage maladroit d'idées fondamentalement racistes et de thèses d'un autre temps. J'ai beau être français, blanc, mon identité est construite à partir de mon héritage chrétien, bien que athée non baptisé, et aussi de ce que j'ai pris en grandissant avec des immigrés. Et c'est tant mieux comme ça, je n'ai pas l'intention de nettoyer mon identité pour coller à la vôtre.

La République a effectivement réprimé ces cultures régionales, pour imposer une identité nationale, et aujourd'hui, cette République nous interdit de faire valoir notre identité et notre culture (chanter la marseillaise, brandir le drapeau Français, faire des apéros saucisson pinard c'est être un « facho »), et encourage les étrangers à faire valoir les leurs et à en être fiers. L'hypocrisie a des limites qui sont clairement responsables de la situation actuelle et future.

Regarde l'histoire du Liban, du Kosovo, de l'Algérie et ailleurs pour voir les problèmes de coexistence et l'avenir de la France.

&gt; Je rejette l'enrobage soi-disant culturel des identitaires. Pour moi ce n'est qu'un habillage maladroit d'idées fondamentalement racistes et de thèses d'un autre temps.

En tant qu'apolitique, je n'ai pas dit que tout me plaisait forcément chez les identitaires, mais le fait est que le système cherche à faire taire ces courants d'extrême droite. Cela va de la diabolisation aux manipulations (dont j'ai personnellement été témoin lorsque je travaillais pour une chaîne de télévision) en passant par les poursuites judiciaires à répétition à l'encontre de sites ou blogs comme Fdesouche.com. Partant de là, une action comme celle du chantier de la mosquée de Poitiers est le seul moyen pour eux de faire entendre leur avis.

&gt; Tu peux insulter qui tu veux, et accuser les immigrés de tous les maux dont tu crois souffrir, si ça te défoule.

Je crois que tu te méprends, ce ne sont pas les immigrés qui sont la cible, eux n'ont rien demandé en particulier. La cible, ce sont les responsables de cette immigration de masse et leurs lois débiles qui non seulement instaurent la chose, mais empêchent également leur contestation.

Il faut au contraire sortir le débat de l'ornière raciste, il n'a absolument rien à y faire. C'est un débat de société qui concerne tous les Français.

I hope now you guys get what is Greece's problem with the usage of the term ""Macedonia"".

I won't go to what happened in ancient times, the majority of academics already decided on that. Now 5 million people live in the modern region called Macedonia. 2.5 million of them identify as Greeks and they call themselves Macedonians. It's the same as with Bavarians and Germans, an identity within an identity. They live in 51% of the region. In the neighbouring republic that became independent 20 years ago, 1.2 million people call themselves ""ethnic Macedonians"". Their country occupies 38% of the region of Macedonia, and the ""ethnic Macedonians"" constitute 65% of that country, with Albanians at 25-30%. The rest of the region's area and population belongs to Bulgaria.

So you have 1.2 million out of 5 million people not accepting that they are not ""the"" Macedonians, but ""some"" Macedonians. That's Greece's [and Bulgaria's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Distribution_Of_Races_1918_National_Geographic.jpg) problem.",0,1350911861,null,0,false,0,c6q3zhj,t3_11ucr6,t1_c6q3zhj,t1_c6pqzbt,null,1430210946,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Bad Guy A might have a hard time affecting a large portion of the American economy, but the Icelandic one is tiny. Bad Guy A is probably richer than all of Iceland anyways. And it's so easy that we currently have currency controls in place to keep shortchangers from ruining our economy, post-crash. I'd rather not go into the details of that. There are just smart men out there who realized what was going on and decided to make a lot of money off us. We also realized what was up and broke all sorts of international laws to prevent that from happening. We are currently in breach of the EFTA as there is no ""free flow of money"" to or from Iceland.

Currency controls: What do they mean? Well they mean that I cannot access foreign currency unless I can show the administration a plane ticket with which I intend to go abroad. And then I'm limited to 500K ISKs worth of said currency. The same goes for all companies in Iceland.

Why does that matter? Because nobody buys ISK except Iceland as it's a useless currency. Iceland does not produce enough food, and is incapable of doing so, for the entire population. How are we going to buy food into the country if nobody wants to buy our currency?

We sell fish, for that we get foreign moneys as nobody has ISK to pay us with as nobody buys that turd. That's foreign currency into our central banks currency vaults. Foreign currency that importers then have to apply distribution from so they can stock their shelves. It should be fairly obvious why this is horrific, we're heading into late 80's USSR if we don't find a way to drop the currency controls.

Now if you can find me someone else that would be cool with bleeding moneys out to save our asses, that's great! I'd still prefer the EU because I like the idea of tearing down walls and cooperation even if it comes with new problems to deal with. This is not a view that is shared by everybody, nor can everybody use it to rationalize their federalist tendencies. I'm fine with that. But I'd still rather join the EU than the US as I consider myself European.

It's actually quite possible that at some point, in the near future, Iceland will have to take a long hard look at how much it is willing to sacrifice in individual independence in order to ensure complete sovereign independence.

The reason i am often seen arguing against the anti-islamic comments, is because they always tend to be bigoted and narrow-minded. That's what i oppose. The fact that people use ""Muslims"" as a self explanatory sentence whenever rape, terrorism or angry mobs are mentioned. 

I don't support Islam. But i tolerate their right to have their opinions. Just like i tolerate the Neo-Nazis right to hold their demonstrations, or the right for greeks to vote for Golden Dawn. I don't like it, but part of being civilized is to tolerate things you do not like.

Obviously i am not supporting rapes conducted by immigrants, or the behaviour of the people in the Riot video. My opinion on the peopel in these videos are most likely very similar to yours. But i try to think about **why** they happen. There are so many factors that people like to ignore and just make assupmtions.

In the US, Blacks are overrepresented in the crime statistics, rape, batterings etc. But it's not because they are black. There are tons of other factors who are relevant. Just like there are tons of other factors who are relevant for the muslims.

The difference between me and the ones i argue against, is that i try to think further than ""They  are muslims"".

It is not like Catalans had any other option with the army still being a political actor in the transiton to democracy.

In fact the degree of autonomy has decreassed, since the ruling of the Constitutional court in 2010, the model for the catalan educational system is under constant atacks from the Spanish institutions, and the Catalan language is being minoritized and curtailed in Valencia, Mallorca, and Aragon.

&gt;La République a effectivement réprimé ces cultures régionales, pour imposer une identité nationale, et aujourd'hui, cette République nous interdit de faire valoir notre identité et notre culture (chanter la marseillaise, brandir le drapeau Français, faire des apéros saucisson pinard c'est être un « facho »), et encourage les étrangers à faire valoir les leurs et à en être fiers. L'hypocrisie a des limites qui sont clairement responsables de la situation actuelle et future.

Première nouvelle, chanter la Marseillaise est punie par la République. Mais personne ne vous empêche d'être fiers de votre identité, on vous demande simplement de ne pas chercher à détruire celle des autres. Ne jouez pas les victimes. Quant à l'Histoire et les conflits culturels, ils sont le fait de gens comme vous, apeurés, violents, haineux et intolérants, et il n'y a pas de culture qui ait le monopole de ce genre de personnes. Mais ça c'est de la propagande gauchiste, c'est tellement plus constructif d'inciter à la haine.
