true,xdanc,null,null,"I might have some helpful insight for you. When I was your age, I had the same idea to move to Europe. I am originally from a small town in Wisconsin and nobody in my family has ever left the country so I had a lot to learn! I saved up money by working at a coffee shop and I went to French language school in Annecy, France the summer before my senior year of high school. I fell in love with France and researched the possibility of pursuing an undergraduate degree in France. I applied to American universities and I deferred my admission at a private liberal arts school outside of Los Angeles. I took a gap year and worked as an au pair (a nanny) in Nice, France for the first part of my gap year. This gave me a visa and plenty of time to progress in French and tour universities. For the second half of my gap year I pursued an internship at the European Parliament in Brussels for 8 months. I was able to add a relevant professional experience to my CV and travel around France for admissions interviews. My application to the French school Sciences Po Paris fell through at the last minute so I had to return to the US for my undergraduate degree. I worked closely with my liberal arts school and was sent to Strasbourg, France for a three month internship at the Assembly of European Regions and for study abroad I was able to study for a year at Sciences Po Paris. I am now 22 and in my final year of undergrad... hoping to go to grad school in Belgium or France! 

Some advice:
1) Learn and perfect a language. Fall in love with a specific country or language community. Vague dreams of ""Europe"" won't get you anywhere. Especially with English. 
2) Don't put all of your eggs in one basket. Don't just leave the US without having backup plans in your home country. The bureaucracy in many European countries will eat you alive. 
3) Test the waters. Consider taking a gap year or spending a summer in a European country. 
4) I can only speak for France and Belgium, but tuition at public universities is much cheaper -- even for Americans. I'm talking a couple hundred €. Most programs at public universities require proficiency in the language of the country. Beware of American universities abroad... you will pay high tuition like in the US. Don't let money be a huge motivator though. My adventures in Europe started with a dream of a cheaper degree, but financial aid really came through for me. My undergraduate degree in the US is quite cheap! 

TLDR - learn a language, take a gap year, don't just ""jump ship"" on America until you've really thought this through and weighed all of the pros and cons.",0,1341034305,null,0,false,0,c57laeh,t3_vtq29,t1_c57laeh,t3_vtq29,null,1429264649,16,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,16

One of the redeeming features of European countries is that they have a social system for leaving each other alone even in crowded environments.  US Americans are often put off by the fact that Europeans don't casually connect with them, and it seems rude to Americans.  Wrong!  It's a matter of social survival and respect. Europeans, in general, don't like to intrude on the thoughts or lives of strangers.  You *might* actually learn to appreciate this a lot, as I have, and find it a relief from US culture of constant intrusive smiling and fake instant friendship with waiters/salesmen/strangers.

If you move to Europe, do research.  Make a firm decision on which country interests you the most.  Study the culture and their habits from afar and for dog's sake LEARN THE LANGUAGE.  It's the very least you can do if you are firmly committed to living outside the USA.  No, you won't really learn the language until you immerse yourself in the culture but learn what you can about it's structure and casual use.  Anything helps.

You are 17.  If this is TRULY your plan, become passionate about it.  Go to a college with an international year abroad.  Save all your money.  Start hanging out with local immigrants from Europe.  Use your early language skills on social network sites for that country (and let yourself be laughed at.  So what?  You are learning.)

It's not easy to immigrate to Europe or anywhere else.  It's supposed to be hard.  Each country has it's own rules and social attitudes towards immigration and Americans.

* Bulls are scary huge things, but pay a lot of atention to the people around you. Encierros are really crowded and if you only look back you are very likely going to crush into someone wich can be really dangerous. Look to your sides and front and avoid getting surrounded by too many people.

* The first track of the encierro is usually where the bulls run faster becouse they are not tired and because it is upwards. Less people run there  but i  dont think you should either if you are not a experienced runner.

* Avoid running if possible the weekend encierros, too many people. Also, 7th july was statistically the encierro with more people running last year (although it wasn't the weekend).

* They clean the street before the encierro and the pavement might be wet, use proper footwear and try to warm up a little bit before the run and check that you are not going to slide.

* It is forbidden to touch the bull and also carrying cameras with you while running. You shouldn't carry any kind of backpack.

* Never taunt the bulls.

* If you fall down you shouldnt try to get up untill all the bulls have passed, cover your head with your hands. They might walk over you wich is bad, but it is worse if you get up and for some reason you  make a bull stop and focus you.

* Don't run behind the bulls, i know it is kind of stupid but you will see a lot of people doing this. It is bad because the only thing you can achieve from there is making some of the bulls go back putting a lot of people in danger.

* The track is supposed to be clean and closed at 7:00. Then only people who are going to run can get in until 7:30. There are only 2 entrances one in the Plaza del Mercado (market) and another in Plaza del Ayuntamiento (Townhall). If you are going to run, you dont need to get early there, if you want to watch the encierro you will have to be there really soon (like really really soon, i've seen people saving their spot at 4:00). 

* You will see police along the track (of course before the running). They check for people that might be drunk or not wearing suitable clothes. You shouldn't have any problem with them.

* As someone mentioned the entrance to the Plaza can be really dangerous; there are 2 gaps on the sides where people that fall can crouch to scape. Try to check them before running.

About the tickets for the bull fights; usually the best bull fights will be completly sold out before you even get to Pamplona. You might be able to buy at the Plaza tickets for another day though. There is a lot of people trying to ""scam"" tourists with resales (i dont know if this word is correct) so be careful if you dont buy at the ticket office. 
Is it worh it? I don't know, i dont like bull fighting. I think tourist usually find the show cruel and i understand them. Some people might say it is because they dont understand the fight between the animal and the bull fighter the tradition behind it  and all that jazz of life and death, but for me is just boring (i am young though).

This is what i can tell you from a non-runner experience, if you have any more question feel free to ask. I am sorry for any grammar/spelling mistake i've probably done.

true,Maslo55,SVAK,Slovakia,"&gt;What? Of course they most relevant. I'm quite sure that the proverbial man on the street is much more concerned about absolute crime than relative crime and his wife fears absolute rape more than relative rape.

Restricting immigration in general, and specifically of more dangerous ethnicities will of course reduce the absolute crime. If you are interested in reducing absolute crime, it should be done. Why not? It will only cause benefit, and no harm.

&gt;If per-capita numbers are so relevant, why should we worry relative crime done by immigrants when young men are so grossly overrepresented?

I am not saying the police should not primarily try to target young men, as more likely perpetrators of crimes than for example old women.

But there is a very big difference you purposely omit - you cannot really restrict the amount of young men in a country without grossly infringing on basic human rights and damaging the country. Therefore reducing crime by trying to eliminate young men is not a viable strategy. It defeats the purpose of reducing crime, which is to increase quality of life and human rights of the citizens.

The same is not true for reducing immigration. The privilege to immigrate is not a basic human right, and immigration is easily restricted with no damage to any basic rights of anyone or the country. So there is no reason why not do it, contrary to reducing the numbers of young male citizens.

&gt;It's not a huge surprise if young immigrant men rape more than native grand mothers do, but the same observation is equally obvious if we didn't take ethnicity in account.

Really? Thats your assertion with no proof. Do young males of finnish origin commit the same amount of crimes per capita than foreign young males?

&gt; Should I use this to deduce that the relative criminality of Russians, Estonians and Swedes is higher than average?

Yes, of their immigrants. Why not?

&gt;According to you, undeniably so. Estonians, Russians and Swedes are clearly ethnicities with affinity for crime as their inherent cultural property, unlike us Finns. It must be something in their drinking water, I guess. Reductio ad absurdum, you are quite demonstrably wrong.

Nope. It must be the fact that they are still immigrants, which generally commit more crime per capita than native people in a country. Of course, that does not mean that some immigrant populations are not even more likely to commit crimes than others (as has been shown in the other thread - north african immigrants are overrepresented per-capita than eastern european immigrants in Sweden), because of their culture or social factors (they might be generally poorer than immigrants from other countries).

Muslims and jews, even if they live a very secular life, are very very devoted on male circumcision issue. It is a must for them. They are shunned if they don't get their kids circumcised. It is a ritual where you get people in your house after circumcision, serve them food, and they give you gifts back. 

Whether circumcision is harmful or not, this may create unintended consequences. People will get their kids circumcised out of hospitals. They will not get their kids to doctors, and risk taking-uneducated butchers will cut kids penis. I hope many immigrants will go to their country of origins to get their kids to circumcised in this case: at least a doctor will do the operation. But those who can not go to other countries may take extra risks, which may end up hurting quite a few children. 

I can assure you, more than half of muslims will get their kids to be circumcised, no matter what. This tradition is deeply embedded in culture, and it does not even have strong religious roots; circumcision in islam is not a ""farz""-order of god-, though it is recommended by prophet. You'll see a lot of muslims drinking, or not praying regularly, although these two are really big issues in islam. On the other hand, you'll see people get passionate about circumcision, since this is an identity issue.

true,Maslo55,SVAK,Slovakia,"&gt;By the same logic we should restrict immigration of men, as restricting specifically immigration of more dangerous genders will of course reduce the absolute crime.

It will also harm the citizens of the country, because it will over time cause gender imbalance which is bad. Nothing comparatively bad would result in restricting immigrants based on country of origin, since there is no harm in not having very multicultural society, quite the opposite might be true - [Psychology of confidence: Multiculturalism destroys trust, economic well-being, happiness and social cohesion](http://www.jihadwatch.org/2012/06/psychology-of-confidence-multiculturalism-destroys-trust-economic-well-being-happiness-and-social-co.html).

&gt;Choosing ethnicity, but not gender is an arbitrary judgement made by you.

Nope, I chose ethnicity and not gender because its the best option how to reduce the immigrant crime with the least unwanted consequences. If you have a better criterion, feel free to share it.

&gt; I only spoke about restricting immigration of men to achieve my reductio ad absurdum conclusion. I was not arguing for a gender genocide, which would have been clear if you had actually bothered to read my post.

OK then, see above. Its not bad because its discrimination (discrimnation should be allowed when we are dealing with privileges and not rights), its bad because it will lead to gender imbalance. In China for example (which already has gender imbalance), gender discrimination when it comes to immigration aimed to correct it would be beneficial.

&gt;restricting the immigration of certain ethnicities leads to an human rights violation by violating the 14th article of Universal Declaration of Human Rights

&gt;Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries **asylum from persecution.**

Asylum from persecution =/= all immigration

&gt;Also, immigration is already restricted: there isn't free movement between borders. In order to argue for your position of restricting immigration, you have to be more specific, as some form of immigration restriction is status quo. 

Decreasing the quotas, and differentiating them according to country of origin and education or skills needed in the job market etc.. Its obvious this in not done enough, when Tensta suburb which has 66% immigrants has 43,5% unemployment. Quality over quantity should be the guide of good immigration policy.

&gt;This is peripheral to our discussion, but I personally seek to reduce crime, because criminal acts are evil. This is a result of my view that consequences are not moral, only acts. But let's not delve further into this.

This actually caught my eye. Are you some kind of moral anti-consequentialist? My view as a consequentialist (utilitarian) is then exactly the opposite - its the consequences which determine morality, not acts in themselves.

&gt;You argued this as a method of determining relative criminality of ethnicities, not immigrants. If you change goal posts in between, then admit it.

I argued that it is a method of determining relative criminality of immigrants of different ethnicities (which is exactly what it measures). Whether this is also applicable for those who stay in the source countries is another question, and more factors come into play then (whether the immigrants are well representative of the source population or not).

&gt;No, the cause of crime is of great importance, second only to its importance to justice and moral harm. How are you going to stop rape if you don't delve into causal factors of it, for example?

Its not really important for my point - Restricting immigration from countries that provide high criminality immigrants would reduce crime whether they tend to have higher criminality because of cultural or social factors.

One my (Italian) boss saw on a wall in Slovenia last week when he was attending a conference:

The mayor of a Slovenian town wanted the town hall repainted.  He wrote a specification and offered the job for tender, receiving three offers --- one from a German, one from a Frenchman and the last from an Italian.  The German offered to do the job for €3000, the Frenchman for €5000 and the Italian for €9000.  Perplexed as to why there was such a huge range of prices, he invited all of the men to come for an interview.

At interview, reflecting characteristic Teutonic efficiency, the German stated that he would use the cheapest paint to get the job done, and use the minimum number of coats of paint to properly cover the building, taking €1000 in profit.  The Frenchman stated that he would use a slightly more expensive brand of paint, and use a few more coats in order than the paintjob last, again taking €1000 in profit, hence why his offer was more expensive than the German's.  Then came the Italian.  Asked by the mayor why on Earth his offer was so much more expensive and why anybody would take it, he replied: ""but my offer is the best one for all concerned, as you'll see: the €9000 is split three ways: I take €3000, you take €3000 and the remaining €3000 is given to the German to actually do the job.""",0,1341070021,null,0,1341070386,0,c57p8fp,t3_vt3ib,t1_c57p8fp,t3_vt3ib,null,1429266576,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

Not true. Removing just the clitoral hood (directly analogous to male circumcision, if less severe) also falls under the spectrum of practices considered FGM and thus banned in many European countries.

Second, some people might not condone other activities that are perfectly normal, like women wearing what they want, and choosing their partners. Civil rights are not about what some religious groups might or might not condone, or about activities that some communities might find repulsive or not. Drawing parallels with polygamy or incestuous relationships, whenever the concept of gay marriage is mentioned, serves only as a distraction from what a modern secular state should be.

The same consequences arise from female circumcision, because their families will just take them to a foreign country to have it done to them, or even have somebody brought into the UK (or other European countries) for the sole purpose of performing the circumcision, which can have serious medical consequences for the female child.

It is a traditional practice rather than a religious one - Islam does not say that circumcision for either gender is mandatory (I don't know about Judaism).

My advice would be to try to check the different areas before the whole  thing begins. You can also watch this [map](http://sanfermin.pamplona.es/img/encierroplanog.jpg) so you can have an idea of how it goes more or less. The thing is that the best areas and probably the safest too, are usually the most crowded (Estafeta street would be the example), so try to find a confortable place but more important a safe one. 

About the tickets, i think they are around 50 euros (60 USD i think) but you will have trouble to find them because 90 per cent belong to the people that take the ""year ticket"" and the ones that come out on sale run out very quickly (i think they come out on sale the day before of the particular bull fight but i am not sure). Resale will try to sell you the tickets x3 (or more) of its real prize you should try to bargain and always check the date of the ticket (might try to sell you a fake one or maybe for a different bull fight). I dont know much of this stuff so take this advise with a grain of salt.

It is going to be packed everywhere because as you can see in the videos there is a lot of people, and only a few areas with the wooden fences (dont know how you call that) where people try to watch. I've never tried because you almost have to fight for a good spot, you have to wait a lot (wich means that you are loosing party time) and because TV broadcast of the encierro is awesome.

Da werden sich die Italiener, die Spanier, die Griechen, die in diesem Rat sind, sehr freuen, dass sie sich bzw. ihren Banken die Steuergelder Deutschlands direkt durchschieben können [...], ohne dass die Staaten dafür haften müssen.""

This church had been destroyed in WWII (like a lot of buildings in DD) and later been completely rebuilt. The interior is great and if you climb the bell tower you have a nice view over the city. For the culture there are also some museums the would be recommended. [Grünes Gewölbe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%BCnes_Gew%C3%B6lbe) comes to mind and also some art galleries like the [Alte Meister](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Masters_Gallery) and the [Neue Meister](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galerie_Neue_Meister).

But my personal favorite spot in DD is the Elbe Valley. Due to the possibility of floods there are no buildings directly near the river. That makes it a perfect calm spot for relaxation because you often here very little of the citys usual noises. In July and August they also have the [Filmnächte](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/Filmnaechte.jpg) near the river where they show movies (but usually with german dub) and have concerts outdoors while having a nice look at the [Brühlsche Terrasse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Br%C3%BChlsche_Terrasse).

Some other nice place near DD you could visit is [Castle Moritzburg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moritzburg). You could also have lunch or coffee at the Spitzhaus in Radebeul. It's a bit hard to find but if you get there you'll have a fantastic view over Dresden. In case you like hiking you could go to the [Sächsische Schweiz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxon_Switzerland). Its about 30 km east of Dresden and has some nice peaks to climb.

Re: the contrast. I would be very surprised if religious circumcisions in the US even approached 5%. It's just not a religious thing. I don't think people in Europe (or at least /r/europe) understand that. It's primarily medical/social. Below are some of the medical reasons. (I'm surprised Europeans don't consider this)

&gt;The American Academy of Pediatrics points to a survey (self-report) finding circumcised adult men had less sexual dysfunction and more varied sexual practices,

&gt;""... No valid evidence to date, however, supports the notion that being circumcised affects sexual sensation or satisfaction.""

&gt;There is strong evidence that circumcision reduces the risk of HIV infection...

&gt; A 2006 meta-analysis of observational data from twenty-six studies found that circumcision was associated with lower rates of syphilis, chancroid and possibly genital herpes.[105] More recently, a 2010 review of clinical trial data found that circumcision reduced the incidence of HSV-2 (herpes simplex virus, type 2) infections by 28%.

&gt;Most cases of these conditions (An inflammation of the glans penis and foreskin) occur in uncircumcised males, and affect 4 to 11% of uncircumcised boys.

&gt; A 2011 meta-analysis concluded that childhood or adolescent circumcision substantially reduces the risk of invasive penile cancer. 

&gt;In 2012, Morris et al. reported that there is some evidence, albeit mixed, that circumcision may protect against prostate cancer;

[Reddiquette](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/reddiquette) states: 

&gt; [Don't] Downvote opinions just because you disagree with them. The down arrow is for comments that add little or nothing to the discussion. 

Let's say you're willing to follow the rule. That means you believe that Shenkey's remark ""adds little or nothing to the discussion."". Here it is again, in its full glory:

&gt;Noone said only austerty is the cure. Brussels always advocated structural reforms which are the key and austerity is for buying time.

&gt;But if you are the same as Greece and Portugal and doing only austerity you can't blame anyone for your faliure.


Let's go through it systematically: 

* Is the comment off-topic? No.

* Is the comment an obvious attempt at trolling? No. 

* Does the comment add *nothing* to the discussion? No. It might be not particularly deep or insightful, but it expresses an opinion that many on /r/europe seem to have: that some EU countries hit by the crisis aren't reforming enough.
**Please note:** I'm not saying you have to agree with him. Go ahead, tell the world why he's wrong. But if you downvote an opinion simply because you think he's wrong, at least realize this much: you will be downvoted as well when you write something that others think is ""objectively wrong"", when in reality, you're just taking a different position.

* Finally, does the comment add *little* to the discussion? This is arguable. I do agree, it's not a very deep thought it expresses, but like I said above, there is a substantial portion of /r/europe that believes the European South has a dire need for reforms. Are they wrong in thinking that? I don't know, maybe. Are their opinions **objectively wrong**, in the sense that they are based on statements that can be proven wrong  immediately by checking reality (e.g. claiming ""the sun is green"", to which you can respond: ""just take a look at it""), or that can be proven wrong because there simply is no real argument about it (e.g. claiming ""the world is flat"": almost nobody believes that anymore, and you'll find no serious source claiming that)? Hardly. Let's say an opinion is at least worthy of entering a political discussion if some newspapers or a significant part of the population believes in it. If you downvote, you essentially say ""this does not belong into a discussion about this topic"". I think the comment, wrong or not, still belongs into the discussion, so it shouldn't be downvoted, even if you disagree. It's obvious that this goes the other way as well: if I read a comment saying ""Germany and its politics was a major cause for the current crisis"" I will strongly disagree, but I will not downvote.

Yup. He wouldn't have been the integrating figure he may or may not have been otherwise, because of that thing right there. I was disappointed when they chose to go the low-profile route, because as Blair said, the role of the new presidential position wasn't clearly defined. It had been assumed that the first president would ""shape"" the position to either be one of authority or more or less administrative.

But had they chosen Blair, I would have argued that it would be against the very idea that the European Project had been built upon. The main motivation was to prevent wars. I would have been the first to call him the worst possible choice.  
I don't know if the war could have been prevented, IIRC Blair once said Bush was set on the idea and he had hoped to be able to influence the process by getting him to wait for a UN mandate first and so on. But by going along with it he did more than just take part, he helped built a pretense of legitimacy. The Americans never tired of pointing towards the ""Coalition of the Willing"" and at how many countries sent troops whenever the legitimization was called into question. This also made Rice's ""punish France, ignore Germany, forgive Russia"" and Rumsfeld's ""old Europe"" strategy possible, which split the Continent.

Now, there is the assumption (by most neo-liberal economists/pundits/whatever) that the private sector will pick it up at some point, and very little government spending will not equal very little economic activity. This is why the EU is asking for structural reforms alongside austerity. Apparently however the private sector is not picking up, and debt ratios are going higher.

As the casualties of the Iraq War mounted, Blair was accused of misleading Parliament,[81][82] and his popularity dropped dramatically.[83][84] The Labour party's overall majority in the 2005 general election was reduced to 66. As a combined result of the Blair-Brown pact, Iraq war and low approval ratings, pressure built up within the Labour party for Blair to resign.[85][86]
