You come at me in 2nd grade knowledge pretense.

That is fantastic, have a theory. I really, really, really, really, really, wish I could go back in time, declare neutrality, and watch that English Channel get fucking raped (but then the tactical English who realize that war would've been over would be dead, so I lied. Happy we helped.)

You DO realize that the U.K. was pretty much the last ditch effort at stopping them? They would've been wiped so hard it's not even funny. Russia are brute mother fuckers. They would've fought till the women and children were fighting, and I can assure that would've been very, very soon.

Even with our help,
half of Russia lost its population in WW2.
So what would've happened if Germany wasn't using one arm on us, and one on them, but two on them?

You don't know shit about tactics do you?

England was won from the Danes with half the men, and they were all farmers. Danes were traine warriors from birth. It was the frontal assualt that caused the dissarray that in turn beat the great danish army.

If you don't understand how this works, and still think war is a game of chess,
I suggest, like most failed nobles, stick to chess.

Porque todos sabemos que una España bipartidista no es el resultado del populismo y la demagogia... ¿verdad? Suena un poco a ""sin el Rey campechano no nos habríamos librado del golpe de estado"". 

La figura del Rey es la de un vividor, muy a pesar de lo que muestren en los medios. Si tanto aprecio se le tiene a la democracia, se puede separar cargos en Presidente y Primer Ministro (por ejemplo, Francia) en vez de tener una figura anacrónica, con privilegios injustos, de puesto hereditario y no de libre acceso, etc etc etc.

El pueblo debe ser el vigilante, no el vigilado. No necesitamos un rey (que, sin ánimo de ofender, no hace nada de lo que hace mejor que cualquier otra persona formada para un puesto similar) que vele por nuestra seguridad y nuestro bienestar. Además, tal y como están las cosas en España, queda claro que tener un rey no ha ayudado para nada a la hora de frenar un Partido Popular con delirios de grandeza, intereses a tutiplén, y ansias de censurar y convertir la península en una especie de circo ibérico.

The rest of Europe seems fairly optimistic, and is willing to do the things that it will take to solve the problems. The EU basically just forced the hand of Greek's creditors to get them to accept a default. That shows you how committed they are to taking care of business.

Ich habe hier einen Artikel gefunden, der die Sachlage sehr gut beschreibt: http://www.e-recht24.de/artikel/urheberrecht/6558-kino-to-sind-streaming-filmportale-legal-oder-illegal.html

Fazit: Online Filme streamen sind offenbar mit Flashplayern legal. Nur der Anbieter kann rechtlich belangt werden, nicht der Nutzer.

In englishm, you 'll need to be friend of a friend of a friend , is like a big family you need to be part.
Another way around and i can assure that this is true is to pay fro work. I assure you that most of the policeman, and  carabinieri work because they paid from 20000 to 35000 for getting employed. Is corruption but here it's so normale you'll get used. Sad but true. I'm not inventing number or fake stories, i know for a fact that it work like that, maybe not for everyone of us, infact if you are particuraly skilled and/or lucky and/or engineer you 'll find a job too.

Also if you want to work in italy search in the north of italy, the south instead who suffer a lot because the north send to the south industrial trash that venoms the south people and i talk because i'm in the industrial sector and i'm a chemist/scientist not because i'm communisst ;)).

If this doesn't sound crazy enough instead do this: go work in Switzerland or Germany near the actually not really so border.
You can work during the week in germany and with a plane you're in italy in 1 hour. And in 1 hour you'll be in the BEST italy, that is Salerno, Amalfi, And in some ways Napoli, or you can go in Sicilia, the wornderful Calabria. It may sound a bit odd, but while the places i said are not the best for living, i assure you that the rest of the ""better"" italy come here for vacation. Specially Puglia, Calabria, and Sicilia. It sound great! Do this and you will have not to deal with the italian madness.

Like any sport, it shows that you have a healthy way of life. But it is a pretty recent phenomenon, I am not sure when it started in France, and you probably know that a part of the French population is usually reluctant to new trends, especially those comming from America. People mostly jogg in parks or in nature, much less in streets. What people might consider undignified is to see you sweating and ""badly dressed"" in some parts of town, according to my sister this is the case in some of Paris' ""arrondissements"". Appart from that, people will mostly reckon your effort. 

I think the real issue with the president's ""jogging incident"" was the lack of subtelty with which he tried to appear as an ""American-like"" active man. Wearing a NYPD T-shirt while doing something considered as a trend comming from America when you know that a lot of French people are afraid of the ""Americanization"" of our culture, as we call it, might not have been his subtlest move. But if I remember correctly that happened at the beginning of his mandate, at a time when he was actively trying to get into America's (and people who admire America)'s favor, which upset a few people.

&gt; Every year on the evening before Orthodox Easter, the sky above Chios - a northern Greek island close to Turkey - is lit by hundreds of celebratory rockets fired between two rival parishes in a traditional good-natured rocket war known as ""rouketopolemos."" Villagers from rival parishes Aghios Markos and Panagia Ereithiani, in the Municipality of Vrontados, create the handmade rockets in their own homes and shops. The two rival villages compile the rockets into large salvos, which are then set off on the annual celebration marking the Resurrection of Christ, and aimed directly at each other's church bell towers. It is estimated that the yearly production of rockets produces some 70 thousand to 80 thousand small missiles. The winning village is the one which has managed to score the most direct hits on their rival's church, though it is often difficult to produce an accurate tally.

Tatsächlich bist natürlich du der [ausgewiesene Anti-Amerikaner -&gt; Antisemit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/s3mn3/taking_german_chauvinists_down_a_peg/c4axnqt) Du versuchst dein Verhalten auf andere zu projizieren, damit du nicht alleine dastehst. Das wird nicht funktionieren. Für deinen Anti-Amerikanismus -&gt; Antisemitismus bist du ganz allein verantwortlich.

Du hättest deine Chance nutzen sollen, deine Argumente sachlich darzulegen. Dass du damit erst nach mehrfacher Aufforderung meinerseits angefangen hast, liegt ebenfalls ausschließlich in deiner Verantwortung.

&gt;Zu den Wahlen 2003 ging es der Wirtschaft dank einer gigantischen Steuersenkung ziemlich gut.

Erstens ist die Arbeitslosigkeit unter Bush stark angestiegen und zweitens sind die Einschätzung der Bevölkerung und die tatsächliche wirtschaftliche Lage zwei Paar Schuhe. 

&gt;Du hast den Patriotismus nicht kritisiert. Du hast die Amerikaner kritisiert, die angeblich einen patriotischen ""Ungeist"" hätten und deshalb für Präsidenten stimmen, die sie in Kriege führen.

Ich sagte, dass der Ungeist des Patriotismus **stärker ist**, als Sorgen über die Wirtschaft und dass deshalb ein Krieg dem amtierenden Präsidenten eher nützen würde. Und ja, natürlich in Amerika. Darüber sprechen wir hier. 

&gt;Das sind krasse Vorurteile.

Nein, das ist lediglich eine rationale Einschätzung. Eine Bedrohung von außen zu propagieren, um die Reihen im Inneren zu schließen, hat lange Tradition in der Politik. 

Freilich ist das nicht originär amerikanisch, aber in den USA verfängt es eben aufgrund des extremen Patriotismus recht zuverlässig. Deswegen hat die Bush-Clique die Massenvernichtungswaffen und die Al Quaida im Irak erfunden.

Et sans prendre la peine de le comprendre, on va les condamner à l'emporte pièce alors que le malentendu n'est pas forcement si profond que ça.

En fin de compte c'est un peu la même chose qu'avec les cathos créationnistes  aux Etats-Unis. Sauf que les créationniste, on ne risque rien à les exposer comme de simples ignares prétentieux, alors que tenter d'exposer un imam en ces termes va te coûter au moins tes pneus, au pire ta peau. Le simple fait qu'ils ne se gênent pas pour appeler au meurtre (les fatwas) leur ferait mériter un aller-simple au bagne, de mon point de vue. Et il me semble que les oulémas (sages légalistes dans le sunnisme) sont plutôt d'accord, que ceux qui se prétendent mufti (juges et sages) ne sont que des mujtahid (que je traduirais par zélote allumé) 

Alors que le fond du problème n'est que politique. Il y a des musulmans progressistes, mais ceux-ci ont tendance à perdre leurs places dans les communautés car les régimes autoritaires sont plus stables (et pourtant généralement vindicatifs) que les progressistes. C'est ce qu'il s'est passé en Iran lors du reversement du Shah, et en Afghanistan en 1997. Il en résulte une régression en terme d'ouverture au monde, de respect des droits de l'Homme, et de la démocratie, qui ne sont au final que des valeurs occidentales, semble-t-il.

En gros : dans une société éclairée, reposant sur la science, une économie développée et la libre circulation du savoir, alors les valeurs occidentales peuvent émerger face à une religion autoritaire aliénante pour tout ou partie de la population (parti pris volontaire). Au contraire, dans une société en voie de développement, dont la culture est encore plutôt tribale, une religion stricte est le meilleur moyen d'exercer un pouvoir autoritaire nécessaire au maintient d'une certaine stabilité.

Seulement voilà, l'Islam doit s'adapter à la fois aux pays les plus pauvres sous dictature islamique et aux pays développés d'occident ayant une histoire et un développement incompatible avec l'autoritarisme. J'ai pas l'impression que les cathos s'adaptent mieux dans l'autre sens, et on ne peut pas décemment réduire le problème à ""pauvre : musulman, riche : cathos"", sans quoi ce serait immédiatement suivi de politisation et guerre de religion.

Ce qu'il faudrait, d'un coté comme de l'autre, c'est un peu de modernisation et d'ouverture d'esprit. Libérer les interprétation des textes en les prenants pour ce qu'ils sont : de la poésie médiévale qui a servi pendant des siècles comme guide moral tant qu'on avait pas trouvé de meilleur système.

Avec la seconde renaissance qui prend place (société de l'information, libre circulation illimitée, bidirectionnelle et gratuite des savoirs et idées), j'ai bon espoir que ça finisse par se produire. Mais ça va encore mettre du temps si les oulémas continuent de radicaliser leurs interprétations. En France, ça devrait passer par la grande mosquée de Paris, par l'organisation du culte musulman, et par l'éducation (genre de la théologie et de la philosophie au collège, ce serait pas forcement idiot, même si les profs qui assureraient ça se prendrait sûrement des fatwas de la part des imams de la téci).

Not because they didn't like it, but because they had trouble understanding his version of German. He was a Swabian, and read to Saxons. The text itself was written in High German, so it was just his pronunciation that confused the hell out of those people. Quite understandable though, Swabian is a bit more melodic than most other German dialects, even today if they try to speak High German they got a hard time hiding it.

As I noted in one of my replies above the EU has affected a lot of positive social change before and *after* accession in the less powerful countries. Even if countries such as Romania reach economic parity with the more developed nations, they'll still be small, population wise, and thus not able to really resist EU influence. Even economic success itself can liberalize a country is there's low inequality.

It was less an invasion and more a mass movement of people into western Europe. By this stage in Roman history the west was weak and simply allowed many tribes to settle in return for troops and protecting the frontier. Of course there was many battles between these tribes and the empire but they were allies as much as they were enemies.

This is why France is France (after the Franks) and not Gaul. Similarly where England comes from (the Angles) and Lombardy in northern Italy. It is basically the transition period from classical to medieval history.

That's a stupid argument and you know it. You really believe that you receive more accurate information than George Soros? Have you considered that maybe the information *you* receive may be too optimistic?

&gt; The rest of Europe seems fairly optimistic

No, only Germany is optimistic. Greece has had its largest demonstrations since times of dictatorship in the 70s. Spain likewise is in a state of disarray. 

&gt; The EU basically just forced the hand of Greek's creditors to get them to accept a default. That shows you how committed they are to taking care of business

Wait, what? You mean they forced them to accept a *haircut*, not a default. A ""default"" was triggered by someone other than EU or its creditors (the ISDA), but that ""default"" basically signalled that credit default swaps needed to be paid, not that Greece won't have to still pay its creditors back. 

At the same time, the EU (1) bought a lot of the bank-held loans, (2) refinanced the banks through the LTRO, (3) loaned Greece almost as much as it eliminated with the haircut. 

Basically, Greece was worse off after the deal.

&gt; Greece now doesn't have to leave the EU to get its house in order. There is plenty of room for solutions, and for innovation in policies

What planet are you living in? 

First of all, Greece never had to leave the EU. We could've stayed even if we defaulted. [1] 

More importantly, ""there's plenty of room for solutions""? We have 22% unemployment and have entered a negative growth spiral from which it'll be impossible to recover if we still keep pursuing a deflationary strategy. Germany's treatment of us has been horrible, inhumane, incompetent: we went for 'internal devaluation', which has repeatedly shown not to work (there have been more than 20 stories of failure and only 1 or 2 stories of  success). Instead of liquidating our economy and getting investments to spend on building our infrastructure (while at the same time performing the same cuts we're performing now but at a MUCH SLOWER RATE), we got loans that we will never be able to pay, increasing our debt to unsustainable levels.

My post was based largely on the comparison between the tenor of how this topic is discussed daily on the BBC as compared to how it is discussed in Brussels at the EU meetings. The British are unusually pessimistic about things. 

As far as what Soros said, I'll admit I only watched about two thirds of his speech... but I didn't hear anything new from him. I've heard the same kinds of proposals presented by various academics in the mass media of various Western nations over the past few years.

&gt; Wait, what? You mean they forced them to accept a haircut, not a default. A ""default"" was triggered by someone other than EU or its creditors (the ISDA), but that ""default"" basically signalled that credit default swaps needed to be paid, not that Greece won't have to still pay its creditors back.

I think you're very much mistaken. Part of the deal with the disbursement of one of the more recent traunches of EU aid was that investors would take that haircut - that means that two thirds of the debt has simply been wiped from the books. Greece will not have to pay that money back (nor will creditors be knocking on Greece's door trying to confiscate its assets for years to come like they were with Argentina).

Some wanted the Empire to be saved, while the Balkan people wanted independence. In the end they decided to divide nations into small states (Divide and conquer?). Also see the Great Eastern Crisis and Treaty of Berlin again in that wiki.

[The Balkan Wars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkan_Wars) furthermore instilled hatred between the neighbors. These wars are also part of why those countries took part in WWI and the sides they chose.

Also during WWII there were many power struggles for the Balkans. First between the Axis and the Allies and then between the West and the Soviets.

All this has led to an unstable region with countries whose borders don't coincide with ethnicity, nationality and religion and whose people hate each others guts.

Obviously official reports from the EU aren't going to sound pessimistic. What you implied in your original post is that it's only the British media that are portraying the Eurozone situation as bleak, while the rest of Europe's media are optimistic about it, which is false.

To add on you idea-

**Hollande**- I will try to bring growth. Regulate finance more. France can still afford its social programs if taxing is fairer and the rich pay a larger share than under Sarkozy

**Sarkozy**- Crisis was tough, we will have to make sacrifices, but im the only one to get us out of this.

**Le Pen**- This crisis was caused by the Parisian high class and Bruxelles politicians who dont know the problems of ""real"" French people. They only care of getting richer. I will return France to the franc so French goods can be competitive. I will be tough on rules so stricter police. I want large cuts on immigration to preserve culture and reduce unemployment and public spending

**Melanchon**- France is an unfair society where the rich are exploiting the poor. I am against the big finance and for worker rights. I will tax the rich alot and if they leave I dont care. I might be ready to work with the PS if they win. Vote for me and I will change everything. Unlike other far left candidates, I beleive voting can bring revolution.

**Bayrou**- Sarkozy did not do a good job while he was president. Hollande's propositions are too costly. I am the only candidate who is looking at serious issues and has a program that stops the deficit.

**Eva Joly**- We need to preserve our environment. This means no more nuclear plants and trying to find sustainable energy resources. We can not continue business as usual. We have struck a deal with the PS


**DuPont Aignon**- Like Marine le pen I am against the world of finance which has taken jobs away from France and into poorer countries while making a minority rich. I  wish to preserve french culture. However, I am not very anti-immigration and dont make a big deal on Islam.

**Arthaud**- I am also anti-capitalist like Poutou and Melanchon. However, unlike Poutou, I follow a more Marxist (Trotskiste) dogmatic tradition. Like him, I beleive revolution only happens in the streets and not by voting. 

**Poutou**- Like Melanchon and Arthaud I am anticapitalist and for a ""real"" democratic society. For example, I dont want there to be a presidential post and I want a democracy from the bottom.

It's like I'm somehow rejecting my heritage by calling myself ""American"". Which of course isn't the intent; I'm American because I grew up in the US.

Different ideas of what constitutes ethnicity, I guess. ""Becoming American"" isn't the same thing as it would've been to ""become Turkish"" in the Ottoman Empire, which really would be rejecting your ethnic community and going over to the ""other side"".

Krugman is a smart guy, and I'm not going to dismiss his analysis and suggestions as a whole, but the two articles by him, posted on r/Europe right now (this one and the one about Spain in particular) are absurdly simplistic and polemical for an economist of his stature.

The point is, as you correctly point out, that he mainly writes for an American audience.

As a whole, sure, yes. But the economies of the eurozone are not synchronised enough to make this fact informative yet. The eurozone behaves less like a currency area and more like a lot of weak economies that pegged their currency to a strong one. And that's why their economies are affected in the same way as economies of old were affected by the gold standard: first a surge of easy credit and growth, followed by wage increases that were faster than the productivity gains, followed by indebtedness. 

&gt; In any case, you must think Zimbabwe is very fortunate country because they have a through the roof inflation. You can use devaluation for a short time fix, but it is no long term solution. 

On the contrary, I agree that devaluation is not a good solution. We have to either tie up our economies and make sure they stay synchronised, or we have to allow the common currency thing unravel. And when I say tie up the economies, I mean to have fiscal transfers of some sort or other: share tax revenues or jointly guaranteed bonds or even directly balancing one another's budgets. Obviously, to make this fair, more fiscal discipline is required. But you need both fiscal discipline and fiscal transfers, not just the former, like we have now.

&gt; A common currency does however demand a higher level of discipline. Specifically for Spain it required that they did not squander the lower inflation by demanding the same pay increase they did during the period they had inflation. They did not do that, and consequentially they are now struggling with staying competitive with Germany and other nations.

This is a fair point. But I find it difficult to believe that this is easy to do. Has any country ever managed to do that?

Krugman's point was really clear: Germany has neither ethical, nor scientific justification to punish anybody. It's just pointless. (From Krugman's point of view, of course.) It's just some stupid superstition.

That's pretty much it, he doesn't blame anyone, on the contrary -- he calls to act according to current situation without regards to interpretation of past.

Why did you mention blame, are you butthurt or something?

&gt; How is this for an alternative analysis/narrative: maybe certain countries shouldn't have taken all that cheap money in such unmanageable quantities? 

Maybe. But, believe me or not, countries do not act as a whole: some private institutions borrowed money and skewed markets. People, no matter how rational they are, cannot just pretend that this disturbance doesn't exist, they need to take into account skewed markets in their decisions. Besides that, ordinary people have very few options to bet _against_ bubble, and they don't have enough education to understand what happens.

Now when shit hits fan, bank owners only suffer from minor inconveniences while people suffer from unemployment, high prices and stuff like that.

So why is it OK to not help people?

It looks like many people think that inaction is always morally superior to some action. If central banks provides cheap money and thus increases inflation, it's robbing rich people and pensioners. If it does nothing and people suffer from unemployment, not being able to have a decent quality of life -- that's OK, those people are just lazy, and they ""shouldn't have taken all that cheap money"" (which they didn't take).

true,ksan,null,null,"&gt; Marx's proletariat doesn't own any capital. Their only income is the exchange value of the socially necessary labor time. If they own capital, then there income could be above subsistence, and this is something that Marx, unlike Ricardo, doesn't consider. So we could say, that no such thing as Marx's proletariat exists nowadays. I don't think that he would be considered a capitalist either. But in order for him to be considered a proletarian you would have to make some adjustments to Marx's work.

I assume you are not really serious when you say theres' no people living today that do not live entirely off the selling of their labor power, so I'm going to disregard that, since it's obviously not true even if we only apply it to Spain.

As for the rest, Marx did consider the case of someone that both owned capital and worked in order to survive (but could, perhaps, choose not to). The term he used is 'petit bourgeoisie', and although today it's confused with 'middle-class' what Marx meant was someone that owns a very limited amount of capital and cannot in some cases accumulate it quickly enough to live off it. That person will typically either work alone or hire a small number of people. We'd call it something like ""entrepreneur"" or, in spanish, ""autónomo""/""emprendedor"". A full-blown capitalist will, on the other hand, be forced to hire people in order to keep his business going, so there's a clear difference.

The reality is that the vast majority of the working class in Spain does not fall into that group. If the vast majority of your income is earned through your salary it does not matter that you have a few shares in a company or are generating some money in a bank account, you are in the final analysis a proletarian because you are forced to sell your labor power in order to live, which is the crux of the argument Marx made.",0,1334595942,null,0,false,0,c4cxql3,t3_rjzzz,t1_c4cxql3,t1_c4cxkzr,null,1428732985,3,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,3

Naturalmente non la vesserò a riguardo (sono affari suoi!) e forse mi sbaglio, penso che sia un misto di sentire di aver studiato qualcosa più ""in alto"" unito, forse, al fare un lavoro per il quale usa poco % della sua laurea.

Se fosse vero per quest'ultima ragione (mi si vogliano scusare i peli sullo stomaco) per me sarebbero good news in quanto avrei, appunto, meno scarto verso la posizione di chi lavora solo di CAD. Il fatto, come già scritto, che molto spesso si cercano figure che sappiano usare il cad ma non ingegneri/laureati fa ancora ben sperare. Però sono qui per chiedere, appunto :)

true,Oda_Krell,EURO,"German, living in the Netherlands","You're absolutely right, it's much more important to discuss possible solutions rather than blame each other. That said:


1) in order to find solutions, it's also necessary to understand the cause(s) of the crisis, and figuring out those causes (and who was responsible for them) will inevitably touch on topics that can, if phrased in a careless way, sound like blaming. So I agree, let's not call each other names, but I am in favor of naming all the causes of the crisis openly. 

To my understanding, the crisis was neither solely the fault of Southern overspending, German fear of inflation or a greedy financial industry -- it's a bit more complex than just finding a single cause. Which is why it rubs me the wrong way when articles like this Krugman op-ed show up that give some paint by number answer to a question that requires a significantly more complex analysis.


2) independent of my point 1), actually Krugman himself is (with some rhetorical plausible deniability, perhaps) playing the blame game when he says:

&gt;What happened to Spain was a housing bubble — fueled, to an important degree, by lending from German banks 

and then fails to mention in the rest of the article any domestic reasons for that bubble.

Let's please not kid ourselves: that is putting blame on Germany for ""fueling the bubble"". And I call bullshit on that. It is maybe the fault of Euro-wide banking regulations that were too lax, but what German banks did back then was legal, and not even particularly immoral (lending money is kind of what banks *do*), and it simply would have been prudent of the (now) debtor nations (or private debtors, in the case of Spain) to be  more cautious in lending more than they can repay.

You can now (correctly, I'd say) draw the conclusion that we should introduce more legal regulations for the finance industry, but as a general rule, you cannot blame the creditor if the debtor wasn't cautious enough.


You wrote:

&gt;No matter who is responsable for the crisis (and each country is really a different situation), this cure is killing the patients.

You know what, I agree, actually. That is perhaps something that I should add at this point: I also believe that the EU should start spending some serious stimulus money, as soon as possible. Or give the ECB the signal that it should allow for a bit more inflation (which, by the way, is a whole different problem: the ECB is an independent body, so you cannot just ""command"" it to allow more inflation. But we'll see how that might work). 

But at the same time, the debtor countries still need to work a lot on getting their long-term finances into balance, reforming their domestic labor markets, increasing their productivity by whatever means necessary, and more generally, adjust their standard of living to a level that they can sustain long-term without foreign transfer. 

(Please note what I'm saying: I'm not against EU North-South transfers in general. Some moderate level of structural subsidies by the EU is okay. But permanently balancing the budgets of the ClubMed countries by the surpluses of the North is not going to work.)

In any case, nothing of what I just said is the point Krugman makes in his piece of shit opinion piece: his point is much, much simpler. He's not even trying to see the crisis from both perspectives, that of the debtor nations *and* the creditors. His point can be summarized more or less as OMG NO MORE AUSTERITY STOP NOW GERMANY PAY MONEY. And that is just not how things will work out in Europe, with countries like the Netherlands or Germany already feeling milked for all that they're worth (which doesn't mean they really *are* milked for all that they're worth, just that German/Dutch/etc voters feel like that, and that's the political reality we need to work with).


tl;dr Krugman is wrong, not for saying ""Europe needs some stimulus now"" (which I believe as well), but in his complete ignorance of the other side of the problem, that of the financial unsustainability of several European economies, and the fact that the creditor nations very understandably demand drastic changes in the economies of the debtor nations if they are to cough up the stimulus money/accept higher inflation.


tl;dr(tl;dr) ""Stimulus, no strings attached"" is not going to fly.

Your second point I get but it is kind of cherry picking to get to a desired outcome. It is nonsensical because practically in Europe you can't go/invade the geographical ""West"" from west (even if you want to come across the Gibraltar you prolly came from the east), so everyone in ""the west"" came from a geographical point in the east.

Absolutely true, but still, there must be a reason why the markets come to the conclusion that Germany deserves drastically lower rates for their debt than Spain. I'm not saying that it's fair, or even rational, but we **know** markets aren't rational, at least not on a day-by-day basis.

But alright, let's talk about possible solutions: do you think Eurobonds are the way to go? Because if you do, also be aware that there's a very real chance that the cost of those bonds, even though they certainly will be somewhere between the current extrema, might tend towards the higher end, as markets would see it as a defeat of German interests, and probably conclude that the correct risk estimate is the higher one.

Not really sufficient as an explanation. Sure, it might contribute to the problems that markets are shaken and prefer to put their money into a place that is perceived as ""safe"", hence the preference for EU core nations, but that doesn't explain why only *some* of the peripheral nations are hit so hard by the crisis.

Because why then is there such a huge gap between Belgium (3.5%), Netherlands (2.25), Austria (2.87), all ""periphery"" compared to Germany and France, and Portugal or Greece. Unless by ""periphery"" you mean something other than population/economic size. But in that case, we would in fact be looking at possible domestic causes that convince the markets to trust some countries more than others. Low productivity, for example. Structurally high unemployment. Which is at least as much a reason for the difference in rates, I believe

&gt;I think the best solution is the creation of a Euro2 

Maybe. I'm torn about this. Economically, it makes sense. For the purpose of the European integration, it would be terrible, I believe.

Fammi fare un esempio: ti assume la Indesit per disegnare particolari di lavatrici. I pomelli, il cestello, il pannello frontale.... Tu devi sapere come funziona lo stampaggio delle plastiche, come avviene il processo produttivo e quello di assemblaggio, devi sapere come sono fatte le altre lavatrici sul mercato già in produzone, devi sapere cosa può dare problemi e cosa invece è una soluzione già collaudata. A questo punto puoi passare a disegnarla, e il programma che usi è solo un dettaglio: qualche clic qua e qualche clic là, ma sono abilità che chiunque con un paio di mesi di pratica riesce a raggiungere. L'abilità vera sta in tutto il resto, che avviene prima. Insomma se non ti attira l'ingegneria e il mondo dell'industria, non sarai mai un buon disegnatore CAD e/o farai sempre lavori a bassissimo valore aggiunto.

Krugman is not putting the blame on Germany, he is saying Germany is not a innocent bystander on the crisis. It has it share of the responsabilities. There has been the tendency on the past to say everythign is wrong because the South is lazy, and things are a bit more complex than that.

And while you have a point that it was legal the Eurozone should have seen where this would end, and yes you can't blame the creditor but when a company is bankrupt the case goes to court a impartial party, in this case the court is Germany that is also the creditor, so the table is completly skewed for one side, Germany is demanding the countries to destroy their economy so they can pay their debts without any tought on what this will do the those countries and on a populist march that does not realize what this will do to Europe in the mid to long term.

The OMG NO MORE AUSTERITY NOW GERMANY PAY MONEY is complete bullshit, it's talk of someone that has no real concept of what this austeirty is doing on the countries under it. Let's take a look at what austerity did and is doing in Portugal (the numbers might not be 100% correct but should be very close) this is not exhaustive list, could be here all night but so just you have a idea of what the situation is after a year.
  
The unemployment is skyrocketing, at 15% (33% young people) and rising, the taxes are so high right now that VAT revenues were expected to increase by 12% on the first trimester and instead fell 2%, government spending is actually increasing because of the unemployment. Public workers had their salary reduced on average 5% and then had 2 of 14 months of salary taken away, inflaction is around 3,6% while there is a recession of 3,2%. Internal consumption decreased 10% (while in some sectors like cars sales fell 67%), Evnergy cost increased 10% and then 4% on top of that, public transportation increased up to 25%.

The matters are so bad that the IMF itself had to contradict the EU and say that more austerity would only make matters worse in Portugal when the EU was calling for more meassures last week. For the IMF of all institutions say that more austerity is bad I think we are beyond the acceptable by a long margin.

This pnishment, and there is no other way to see this kind of meassures in other way goes way beyond economy only, while the economic repercusions are imediate and everyone can see them, the political repercusions in the long term have the potential to be much greater. The parties implementing this will suffer greatly and will give a rise to populist, nationalist and radical left/right parties, in countries like Spain it can be even more severe since its not very stable. This will lead to a fragmentation of Europe that is already happening and even here on [/r/europe](/r/europe) you can see it, how will you run a currency in 2-3 years when you have booming economies and completly destroyed economies?

I don't think you understood what this essay was about. Krugman doesn't make any positive claims, he just mocks arguments in ""orthodox German-inspired diagnosis"". He just didn't bother to reiterate those arguments as everybody already knows them. It's easy to reconstruct those ""orthodox"" arguments if you look at Krugman's answers:


---
Strawman: These PIIGS just needs to learn some austerity, they spent more than they could afford, and now want some more!

Krugman: No, they didn't spend more than ""fiscally responsible"" countries. Actually they're suffering from consequences of housing bubble.

Strawman: But then they are responsible for organizing this bubble and benefiting from it, now they need to pay, they should be punished with austerity so they'll learn not to fuel bubbles.

Krugman: Actually, bubble was fueled by German banks (among others), which likely profited from this bubble and -- who knows? -- orchestrated it. So why wouldn't we punish German banks instead?
---

Yes, it is a weak argument on its own, but it's just an answer to a ridiculous claim that some entities in Spain should be punished for their reckless behaviour to avoid this behaviour in future.

But, which entities? People? Government? Banks?

Why not German banks then? Makes as much sense. German banks provided those bad loans, so they should be held responsible for the mess.

The point of this mockery is to show how blame-shifting is unproductive. It's better to work on solution than to find people to blame.

You wrote:

&gt;  in order to find solutions, it's also necessary to understand the cause(s) of the crisis, and figuring out those causes (and who was responsible for them) will inevitably touch on topics that can, if phrased in a careless way, sound like blaming. So I agree, let's not call each other names, but I am in favor of naming all the causes of the crisis openly.

But then you write that everybody carries some degree of responsibility. So, how is this productive? Do you really need to know, um, responsibility distribution percentage before you can think of a solution?

If it's complex, as you admit, then it's up to interpretation. People still argue about what was the cause of Great Depression, for  example.

Where do you read such a nuanced statement in this incredibly one-sided piece by Krugman? Do you have an imaginary version of the NYT that I didn't find a link to?

Read my initial argument again: he mentions the bubble, and the only ""cause"" he mentions is cheap German money being supplied pre-crisis. That is not saying ""Germany is not a innocent bystander"", that is saying, poor Spaniards, if it weren't for the Germans, your country would still do fine. No, it wouldn't. Systemic unemployment, relatively low productivity, undiversified economy and an ""all in"" mentality during the real estate bubble are all reasons that Spain wasn't exactly in great shape at the beginning of the crisis.

A person born before 1/1/1948 can claim Italian Citizenship only from his/her father (who was not a naturalized citizen of another country BEFORE his/her child's birth- and a woman can transfer citizenship only to her children born after 1/1/1948 if she was not a naturalized citizen of another country before her child's birth.

""Italian citizen at the time of the descendents birth"" means that he/she did not acquire any other citizenship through naturalization, before the descendents birth.
Italian Citizens NATURALIZED BEFORE JULY 1 1912 COULD NOT TRANSMIT CITIZENSHIP TO THEIR CHILDREN EVEN IF THEY WERE BORN BEFORE THEIR NATURALIZATION (law R.D. 25 giugno 1865, n. 2358)
