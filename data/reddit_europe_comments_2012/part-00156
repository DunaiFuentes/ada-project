As a Brit my experience of learning both French (5 years) and German (2 years) is that I was taught in a way that would allow me to pass an exam. I left school with very little actual knowledge or ability in speaking either language. In fact I'm pretty sure that if I added up the hours of 'teaching' I had to endure and channeled them into self study I'd have been far more effective. 

It was only after I left education that I decided to correct this and set myself the goal of learning another language, something I've adamantly worked on this year.

true,TheMania,null,null,"&gt; Does anyone have (non trolling) arguments for why it wouldn't work?

I don't believe it to be at all sustainable, it's just a band-aid. We need to actually fix the underlying problem, not just address its symptoms.

The [EFC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Fiscal_Compact) (not yet ratified) dictates that all members must have less than 60% of GDP as public debt with severe penalties for those that exceed that target.

The problem with this is that it means that the European non-government sector, that is, private + foreigners (as in Australia/China/USA) must never desire to hold more than 60% of GDP as net savings - something that during a global downturn is likely to happen. This arises simply from the fact that government debt (including the ECB in the ""government sector"" for the purpose of this), by accounting definition, equals non-government savings.

Now if the non-government yearns for more than 60% of GDP in net savings (ie, during a global downturn), this won't necessarily cause a problem for the EMU nations with high export capacity ie Germany. They'll export enough to Greece/Italy/Ireland that they can acquire the net savings in Euros that they desire, by *having these importing nations dissave*. Similarly it'll be dead easy for foreigners to acquire, as their desire to save in Euros is worked into the exchange rate - providing the EMU nations with well-priced imports, again, encouraging nations to dissave.

This is, incidentally, why the US and Japanese governments have so much debt - for the former, the world wants to hold a lot of USD in savings (particularly China), for the latter, the Japanese want to hold a lot of net savings on account of frugality. This isn't a problem for these nations, as being currency-issuers they effectively set their own interest rates on their government bonds, unlike the PIIGS (this is easy to show).

The problem comes around when you try to push down on both sides of the savings see-saw at once as the EFC requires. Money's a zero-sum game, if Germany's saving - someone else is losing their savings or accruing debt. If Greece/Ireland/Spanish householders want to acquire savings (and they do), then either unemployment is rising (which effectively reduces their net savings) *or* their governments are accruing debt, putting them over the 60% threshold. And, EFC aside - these governments are subject to market lending, causing all manner of problems if debt gets too high.

Now obviously unemployment is bad - the EU is losing a billion man hours of production capacity every single week from its 25.4 million unemployed today. And similarly public debt can have devastating consequences when the government is not the currency-issuer, leaving these nations in a real tight spot.

The only way out of this that I can see, the only means of adding stability to what is currently an unstable system, is if we find ways for the currency-issuer - that is, the ECB - to put money into the economy that do not involve someone taking on debt.

This can either be by the ECB bolstering its foreign reserves of other currencies (this supplies foreigners with Euros, reducing the need for governments/householders to supply them with their desired net savings), buying government bonds on a continual basis (not just as bailouts when economies are ruined) or by finding new means to have money enter the economy, such as directly spending on [employing the unemployed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_guarantee) with ""printed money"". The third approach is my favourite, it adds stability, has the tiniest effect on inflation and the exchange rate, ends unemployment (and associated problems of crime, lack of skills, lack of work ethic, etc), and has a host of additional advantages over interest rate setting as the sole means for money to enter the economy. It additionally puts money directly where it's needed - to the cities in recession - and not where it does not need it, a massive improvement over ""one interest rate for all nations"" that the ECB currently has to work with.

I want to leave with this: The only true restraint on our production are real resources, labour/raw materials/technology/etc. The unemployment we see today is due to a shortage of *money*, which - in a well designed monetary system - ought to *never* be a limiting factor. There's absolutely no reason, no advantages, nothing to be gained from idle labour due to a money shortage.

If you really want a geographic cause I'd go more for distance from Germany, which being the economic powerhouse of Europe is a nice neighbour to have and pulls the economies close to it more than those that are farther.  
  
The Iberian peninsula also works as sort of an island due to the Pyrenees so that might give Portugal and Spain some sort of competitive disadvantage. However, although Ireland is an island too,  Italy and Greece are in no such situation.  
  
You can also look at natural resources which the troubled countries are notoriously poor in.  
  
Another alternative is to take the route of human geography and follow the idiotic narrative northern politicians used when this crisis first started (that's now making it so hard to politically solve this crisis as the electorate got convinced this was true) and blame the culture of mediterranean countries.

true,HugodeCrevellier,Normandie,Normandie,"I studied and lived in Boston for years. I've been lucky to date and even be in long-ish relationships with girls from many places: New York, Rhodes Island, New Jersey, Chicago, LA etc ... mostly *white* but also a *Latino* and a couple of *black* girls. In Europe there were also English, German, Italian and French girls of course ... I think that's it.

But anyway, I **haven't seen any real difference** when it comes to the basic relationshipy things for girls of any culture. 

The trick, of course, is to create your own personal/couple's culture. This culture becomes the essential one. It transcends all others, making them incidental.

Remember, relationships are not just about sex but about **all** the pleasures of life. Make it a hobby to figure out what makes her tick. Discover the simple things that put her in a good mood. That's basically it, as far as I've figured.

You'll know when it happens from funny situations where nobody but you two can see the humour, the inside jokes, the conspirational looks, the knowing smiles etc. If you do not share such moments, maybe she is not the girl for you. But that may have little to do with you being *American* and her *French*.  It may simply be that you are not right for each other.

In any case, there are no rules in (or in braking up) a relationship.

You need to make it up as you go along!

But as commentators (e.g., Jon Stewart) noted at the time, what made it such an exceptional speech was that he had focused on facts and communicated them well. In other words, that this style of communication is an exception is what made the speech so exceptional. Along with the outstanding delivery by an exceptionally gifted speaker, obviously.

The AMA session isn't a good example, because Obama could choose which of thousands of questions he wanted to answer and therefore keep control of the agenda. Again, the candidate remains in the position to pick his battles. Still great that he did it, but he could be sure of a friendly crowd.  
It's similar with his appearance on the Daily Show, although Jon Stewart does have a tendency to ask relatively tough questions, at least by American standards. High ranking politicians in the US are treated like royals by the media, heaven forbid they might get offended or embarrassed by being put into a position where they must reply to facts and can't evade an answer. They might not come back -- because in the US, a politician can get away with that. They don't have to expose themselves to journalists' questions once they've made it to the top tier and don't have to struggle for attention anymore. The public seems satisfied with talking heads. the media now has cut the middleman and is talking to party strategists directly. 

I'm not denying that the Democrats tend to be much more open and honestly try to do what's best for the country, but they, too, run their election campaigns like [highly sophisticated](http://swampland.time.com/2012/11/07/inside-the-secret-world-of-quants-and-data-crunchers-who-helped-obama-win/print/) marketing campaigns. You could argue that in face of the realities of US politics (read: Republican populism) they aren't left with a choice, but my criticism is of US political culture, and the Democrats, willingly or not, are a part of it.

This is a lovely article that quite clearly recognises a dry and technocratic solution to the problem of british influence in geopolitics.

Sadly, it is utterly irrelevant for it ignores the human element to society, of identity, and thus cannot provide any useful remedy for Britain/EU relationship.

This stems from not recognising a common demos with a sufficiently converged social and cultural history that might permit indirect governance which would be deemed legitimate for it recognition in being [both] representative [and] accountable.

The crucial feature of indirect democracy is the perception of representation, the collective trust in shared aims and expectations that allows the people to put their destiny in the hands of another, safe in the knowledge that even if ‘their’ man doesn’t get the job then the other guy will still be looking after their best interests.

The manner in which this trust is built is the knowledge that you and ‘he’ have a history of cooperation, and that your respective families likewise have a shared social and cultural history of cooperation, all of which allows you to trust that when adversity strikes ‘he’ will act in a predictable and acceptable way.

I simply do not recognise a sufficiently congruent set of aims and expectations to assent to being governed by the common will of the EU.

This does not mean that we should not strive towards harmonious cooperation and collaboration wherever a common viewpoint will bring a more effective outcome.

A nation is either:
1. a broadly sovereign state within the EU
2. a functioning part of a larger sovereign entity as the euro-core will become

The only other alternative is being a dependent adjunct to a larger sovereign entity. A Sanjak, in short.

Es gilt halt abzuwägen. Entweder wir schaffen mehr Transparenz und Sicherheit oder wir lassen ab und an mal einen Meiler hochgehen. Die Alternative ist die Klimaerwärmung. Es sind keine ""besseren"" Alternativen. Nur weniger schlechte. Und ich bevorzuge den regional begrenzten GAU gegenüber der globalen Klimakatastrophe.

What makes me a bit worried is that the manual does not say stuff like ""after 100K km change the secondary cam belt"", it is more like ""after 100K km do service C"". Of course they do it because they want us to get it to the Ford dealer repair center, but I am just taking it to smaller, cheaper garages. I don't like dealer service centers, they always insist on using brand name parts etc. etc. So we don't really know what to replace when. 

Did you manage to figure it out yourself? Or you took it to the dealer repair? I am at 150K km, the secondary cam belt we replaced already, the primary cam belt is a chain so probably never needs to be replaced, the brakes pads will be soon replaced, brake fluid is done, not sure what else.

As for the noise, my father-in-law drives an older Transit ambulance car with the same engine and he says it has this ""tractor sound"" too, this is just how (older) Ford diesel engines are, no problem at all.

Your 25% estimate is a weighted average of your 35% estimate in Athens and your 20% estimate in Thessaloniki, giving much more weight to Thessaloniki.

I was editing my comment at the moment you replied, and I wrote that in any case, I've treated the Security Forces votes as Police votes. I'm just saying that we don't know the weight of their separate branches in the final results. Did Special Guards and administrative personnel follow the same voting pattern? I think not.

Regarding my projections, yesterday I wrote this.

&gt; Taking into account the ""1 in 3"" scenario in Athens' centre, the ""1 in 5"" in Western Thessaloniki, and the tendency for declining Golden Dawn percentages in the rest of Greece, it seems more plausible that 1 in 5 policemen voted for Golden Dawn in the end.

I've now corrected the typo in my previous reply.

Before finding and analysing all these data, I've projected double the national average among citizens. That's roughly 1 in 6 policemen. The ""1 in 10"" was found in a worst case scenario (which I really should have explained better), in some polling stations, and not nationally. 

Now that I've found the ""trick"" which also led to your analysis, we have a better understanding of what happened. After gathering data from 239 polling stations where 1 in 8 policemen have voted, the ""1 in 5"" projection is the current one. No, we can't draw conclusions from Athens and Thessaloniki alone, which is why I explain what seems to be happening in other cities, with the rest of the members of the Police forces (7 out of 8).

Of the following, which one is racism and should thus result in an immediate ban (substitute Smurfs for something else):

1) I dislike Smurfs, I hate having them leaving near me, I would expel them all back to Smurfland if I could. 

2) Walking around the place I grew and seeing these blue fucks everywhere disgusts me, I will vote for anyone that will close the borders and clean up the country.

3) I am against illegal immigration of Smurfs to my country, and would like to have the authorities follow the law and expel them.

4) I have nothing against Smurfs, but I dislike the idea of my country having a Smurf majority in a few decades

5) All bipeds are equal and I have a lot of respect for Smurfs; however mass migration of Smurfs into Europe/my country/whatever doesn't solve the Smurfland problem at all and has the potential of introducing a problems in the host nation

6) No nationality should be given to Smurfs, I support ""jus sanguinis"" as nationality criteria. A Smurf will never be a &lt;whatever&gt;, regardless of the ID card

7) I am pro migration into my country, but restricted to those of a certain area/zone/country, since they share the same ethnic and cultural background; Smurfs do not necessarily fit inside what I would consider, but individually I would not oppose.

The problem with a ""racism ban"" is that it has the potential of affecting any conversation regarding immigration policy, since the mere idea of someone saying something that is different from ""open borders for all"" can be traced to racism - unless one uses ""weasel words"", like ""culture"", to partially avoid this.

A Danish fellow in this thread said something along the lines of ""I dislike the EU, I would like something like the Kalmar Union, blondes everywhere""; disregarding the informal nature of the comment I, for example, could start crying ""racism"" until he would retract to the point of saying that not only those that were on the other site of the *limes barbarorum* were welcomed, but that every race not even if yet known is not only Dane by birth right as even more Dane than he.

Is this an exaggeration? Perhaps so, but I have seen this used like this a lot of times, thus getting in the way of any debate concerning the concept of nationality, the role of immigration, regional preferences, etc.",0,1352380037,null,0,1352380328,0,c6y9m69,t3_12sw8g,t1_c6y9m69,t1_c6xutjv,null,1430352145,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

To effectively infinite, as central banks set the overnight lending rate swapping assets for cash whenever it's drying up of funds.

Even if we changed reserve requirements to 100%, as the Chicago Plan entails, as long as central banks are setting interest rates there can be no shortage of money for lending - so unless the IMF was also proposing to end central banking I fail to see the point.

Mind you, that's not a bad idea and is called for by at least a couple of prominent economists from the heterodox school of economic thought, MMT. End interest rate targeting, and instead have all money enter the economy through spending, and leave through taxation. Still keep private money creation in the hands of banks (who in theory have credit-worthiness of customers in mind, and ought to be efficient at allocating capital), but no longer with an unlimited source of money at the central bank set interest rates and now with high reserve requirements.

We are, I just don't think you understand why. The ""purpose"" of everything we are, our bodies, our minds etc. is to propagate our genes. We exist because these replicators inside our bodies began competing with each other millions of years ago; think of evolution as an arms race and humans as the cutting edge model in a long line of mechanised battle suits. 

You can't talk about the natural purposes of things without mentioning the ultimate purpose and homosexuality does not exist outside of gene theory; the most compelling theory about it is that it is a byproduct of kin selection. 

More relevant to my earlier point though, humans simply have different priorities than our genes. You could say we are at cross-purposes with our ""nature"".

&gt; Dans ce cas-ci, les attentats de Montauban et Toulouse ont profité à la campagne électorale du président sortant, Nicolas Sarkozy, dont Squarcini est un proche.

Les hommes politiques sont certes capables d'un cynisme à toute épreuve, mais à ce point... 

&gt; Le pays fut pris en otage, l’État et la presse imposant pendant des jours le silence sur tout autre thème politique que la sécurité nationale, le terrorisme, et l’anti-islamisme. Sarkozy remonta rapidement dans les sondages. Il en profita pour introduire de nouvelles lois criminalisant l’accès à certains sites Internet ou les voyages dans certains pays musulmans.

Ca a tellement bien marché comme stratégie que malgré des morts Sarkozy n'a même pas été réélu

&gt; Le PS avait donné dans la même veine, [...]. La « gauche » petite-bourgeoise, telle le Nouveau Parti anticapitaliste et le Parti communiste français, n’a pris aucune initiative pour exposer le caractère profondément anti-démocratique de ces évènements. Elle a suivi le PS.

I think at present those in charge are trying to extend European powers piecemeal, and that results in a lack of rationalization and consolidation, and things being very complicated for the citizenry.

I'm a bit concerned about having military and intelligence at that level, because those are the national duties which have the strongest symbolism, and which are simultaneously the most dangerous when undermined, and the most vulnerable to being undermined. America is a very clear-cut example of the way in which these organizations can overwhelm the structures around them. Whatever you think about the Confederate position in the civil war, it is nevertheless astonishing that American states are not free to secede from the Union. And there seems to be a never-ending succession of CIA and FBI intrigues rolling around.

I think you can find a compromise there. I would have a NATO-esque cooperation of national militaries rather than a single European military, which meant that national symbolism was maintained, and that militaries were free to act independently. I would have a strong internal investigatory capability, especially for fraud and corruption, but probably keep external intelligence more or less at a national level. In terms of whether Britain could be sold on this, it might well be difficult seeing as we have a perception that we still have a strong global role, the old post-Imperial line. I think it would depend on how the symbolism of it was presented.

Considering that it allows us to compete easily in a single market, allows free movement of skilled workers among countries, ensures that the citizens of European nations within the EU and those that it deals with fundamental human rights, invests in young peoples' futures and ensures that areas in which member states' economies are very weak or failing are given priority and funding over those that have strong economies. I, personally, think that those are positives. 

'We' receive less than we pay, as we are a rich country in the EU. However, we have some of the poorest areas in the EU and so receive heavy funding for that where the national government fails to do so, and so do other countries. It's about progressing together as a subcontinent, and investing in everyone's future, not just the rich areas and countries.

 But, there certainly needs to be better budget control not just at a national level, but at a European level as well; not having the budget effectively audited or managed effectively is just a tad idiotic. Certainly, if we aren't idiotic about this we can have a real effect on the budget by making sure it is spent effectively and efficiently without being lost in a black hole.

North Korea is a completely isolated country with few trading partners since the Soviet Union fell - of course a single country with only its own resources and little access to global resources is not going to be able to sustain an industrial economy properly... industrial economies sort of imply geographical division of labour and thus the requirement of global sharing or trading of resources. South Korea is heavily integrated into a global system with access to a huge variety of markets.

I really don't know much about the history of West and East Germany but I would need to be convinced and not just take it on faith that they had the same potential to develop and that the way they developed was caused by one being a market economy and the other not.

I also think GDP per capita is a poor measure of ""out of poverty"", you need to account for inequality. Median income is a better measure. Ideally you will include in that any services provided by the state that are not directly paid for as well. I wouldn't be surprised if West Germany was still doing better though even accounting for that. I'd be interested in the figures. Also I don't think a single year snapshot is a sufficient comparison.

true,jaqq,null,null,"&gt;Als ich 5 war, hatte ich **eine** Lungenentzündung und Bronchitis. 


&gt;Ich war eine Woche im Krankenhaus aber ich kann mich nicht daran erinnern. 

You can omit the second ""ich"". The one from the main clause is still the subject: ""..., aber kann mich nicht daran erinnern"". Oh, and don't forget the comma.

&gt;Weil ich allergisch gegen meine Antibiotika war, bin ich auch zweimal im Krankenhaus gegangen.

""Weil ich allergisch gegen meine Antibiotika war, war ich zwei mal im Krankenhaus."" Or ""..., musste ich zwei mal ins Krankenhaus."" If that's what you're trying to say.


 &gt;Jedoch musste ich die Nacht nicht bleiben.

That's translated a bit too literally from ""staying the night"". In German you would say ""über Nacht bleiben"". 



&gt;Jetzt wenn ich eine Entzündung habe will ich nicht Antibiotika nehmen, weil ich allergisch gegen die meisten Antibioka bin. 

""Wenn ich jetzt eine Entzündung habe, will ich keine Antibiotika nehmen, da ich gegen die meisten (von ihnen) allergisch bin.""

The second ""Antibiotika"" is not needed. ""die meisten"" refers to the subject of the main clause. 

&gt;Glücklicherweise jetzt erkälte ich mich nicht oft. 

Sentence structure. ""Glücklicherweise erkälte ich mich (jetzt) nicht (mehr so) oft."" If you're trying to say that you don't get a cold often *in general*, leave the parentheses out.

&gt;Wenn ich krank bin, schlafe ich meistens und trinke viel Wasser. Jedes Mal wenn ich mich nicht wohl fühle, habe ich viel Hunger und ich möchte viel essen.

Very good overall, but one little thing: You can again omit the second ""ich"" in the main clause. ""..., habe ich viel (or better ""großen"") Hunger und möchte viel essen.""

&gt;Ich esse dann gern**e** Jok, eine chinesisches Reissuppe, die mir besonders gut schmeckt, wenn ich krank bin.

""Gern"" is the shortened version of ""Gerne"" and is only used in speech or indirect speech. Otherwise the sentence is perfect, though a bit redundant. :)

&gt;Ich versuche, es mir zu machen, aber meine Mutter kocht es besser.

""Es sich machen"" will be understood as ""masturbating"" by immature minds. :)

&gt; On 16 December a protest broke out in Timişoara in response to an attempt by the government to evict a dissident, Hungarian Reformed church pastor László Tőkés. Tőkés had in July that year made critical comments against regime's Systematization policy to the Hungarian television, and complained that the Romanians do not even know their human rights. As Tőkés described it later, the interview, which had been seen in the border areas and was then spread all over Romania, had “a shock effect upon the Romanians, Securitate as well, on the people of Romania. […] [I]t had an unexpected effect upon the public atmosphere in Romania.”

&gt; For some time, his parishioners gathered around his home to protect him from harassment and eviction. Many passers-by, including religious Romanian students, spontaneously joined in.

&gt; The next day, trains loaded with workers originating from factories in Oltenia arrived in Timişoara. The regime was attempting to use them to repress the mass protests, but they finally ended up joining the protests. One worker explained: ""Yesterday, our factory boss and a Party official rounded us up in the yard, handed us wooden clubs and told us that Hungarians and ‘hooligans’ were devastating Timişoara and that it is our duty to go there and help crush the riots. But I realized that wasn't the truth.""

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;I'm a bit concerned about having military and intelligence at that level, because those are the national duties which have the strongest symbolism, and which are simultaneously the most dangerous when undermined, and the most vulnerable to being undermined. America is a very clear-cut example of the way in which these organizations can overwhelm the structures around them. Whatever you think about the Confederate position in the civil war, it is nevertheless astonishing that American states are not free to secede from the Union. And there seems to be a never-ending succession of CIA and FBI intrigues rolling around.
&gt;
&gt;I think you can find a compromise there. I would have a NATO-esque cooperation of national militaries rather than a single European military, which meant that national symbolism was maintained, and that militaries were free to act independently. I would have a strong internal investigatory capability, especially for fraud and corruption, but probably keep external intelligence more or less at a national level. In terms of whether Britain could be sold on this, it might well be difficult seeing as we have a perception that we still have a strong global role, the old post-Imperial line. I think it would depend on how the symbolism of it was presented.

I'm aware of these difficulties, it's obviously not something that can be changed or made appealing to everyone overnight, I just think that on the long run, it would benefit us all more if we defined better the role of the EU and made a distinction between what should be universal (like defending freedom, liberty and democracy; protecting EU citizens against foreign threats; ensuring free trade within the single market; etc) and what could be done on an European level but wouldn't the role of the EU and therefore would be optional (Erasmus programme, CAP, CFP, etc).

But, of course, there's difficulties like you mentioned, another example would be the foreign relations bit where a lot of countries would need to compromise a lot to not lose from the change (Portugal or the UK and their relations with the former colonies, France and its permanent seat on the UN Security Council, etc), so, again, not an easy change but more beneficial for Europe on a long run if it could be implemented, IMO.",0,1352407743,null,0,false,0,c6ygj7p,t3_12u2lh,t1_c6ygj7p,t1_c6yanjk,null,1430355472,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,careib,ROMA,Romania,"I used to take my 2002 to small garages for years, but they either did a lousy job or it took days/weeks for them to do shit and only did a mediocre job. In that time I did maintenance whenever I heard something or felt something wrong, or if the mechanic noticed something when it was with him for an oil change.   

For the last two years I took my old Mondeo directly to a dealer. With a dealer you get an appointment and they know exactly when it will be done, plus they know what they are doing because they actually got training from Ford (they have their own racing team too and the owner is a pretty nice guy too). You can also get a loyalty discount and if the car is registered under a company (mine is) instead of an individual you can take it abroad for servicing and you **don't have to pay the VAT** (within the EU), at all. So with these combined, I pay ~40% less. Not bad if you ask me. Granted, if you don't live close to another country's border (ex. I'm at the dealer in half an hour in my neighbouring country), it's probably not worth wasting the time and money on fuel to get there, but if you take it to a dealer, at least you know that the car is being maintained by people who actually know what they are doing. For me it is worth the premium. Plus the dealer has records of maintenance and in Romania you can ask more for cars if you tell to the shopper that it was maintained at a dealer because you actually have proof that yes the car is in good condition.

I sold my Mondeo this year for exactly €4000. But it only had around 160k KMs in it. Since yours is newer I'm sure you could go over €5000-6000. If you really want to switch cars, I'd say either go with a Focus kombi (or estate or station wagon, [caravan is something else](http://www.carinsurancequotes.uk.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/photo-caravan.jpg)), I assume this is what you meant, or a C-Max. The new C-Max is pretty good though. I like the design, it has a lot space for luggage and the seller will remark that it has a button which automatically closes the trunk door, which admittedly is pretty neat. (the fuckers don't have this as an option for the Mondeo, one of the disappointments I was talking about)

Another example would be the elections of 1840 where the two party system really solidified and also the idea that you must have ""personal appeal"" to become president. The two men were insulting each others character and not their policy. For example, the Whigs said Martin van Buren (or Martin van Ruin as they liked to call him) was a dirty Dutch goblin midget riding in on the coat-tails of Andrew Jackson, and the Democrats said William Henry Harrison was shit and drank Hard Cider and was born in a log cabin (which actually backfired and was used to promote Harrison as a humble man, and to some extent we still today like to vote for the humblest candidate)

They're sent around to do photoshoots and passerelle, but oh so surpisingly they have to pay all sorts of fees (transporation, hotels, 'food', etc.) that add up to exactly the same amount (or more, never less) they were to be payed. They end up owing money to the agencies and so the cycle of unpayed labour doesn't end. That is, unless they want to get the money to pay back to the agencies, which will automatically burn their career to the ground. On the other hand, their career has already come to a dead end. They're slaves and they are to be slaves. All industries start out with slavery, some industries can shove this on Asia or Africa, or the incarcerated throughout America, but some can't so here we are.

You can say whatever you want about the fashion industry, you can spout whatever prejudice makes you feel superior or enables you to cast aside the problem, but the problem remains. All industries have slave labour. We either change our labour culture collectively or slavery will creep back into Europe soon.

And don't get me started on unpayed internships. Many companies in Portugal get entire sectors filled with these unexperienced often incompetent slaves and when the law says it's time to pay them they ditch them and replace them with new ones. The law abides. Sure, it doesn't feel like slave labour for the kid doing the internship (it feels like an internship, whatever that's good for), but from the companies' standpoint they are practicing slave labour.

The audacity they have to tell you that there is some elusive vast majority of Muslims who are willing to peacefully coexist with us degenerate Europeans, explicit commandments of their prophet be damned, and tolerate our abhorrent ways not because they're still outnumbered or at least outgunned but because they're cool like that, despite massive evidence pointing to the contrary, is astonishing.

In non-authoritarian forms of socialism, workers own the company, instead of working to an oligarchy that owns the company, and subsequently owns their labor. The latter is capitalism and is much closer to slavery than the former. Besides there are inumerous examples of authoritarian capitalist regimes where slavery is rampant. So I agree with you that humans will eventually abandon that economy model, even though people like you are letting us all slide down into it.

* 9/11/1923 - The Bierhallen Putsch in Munich, where Hitler and Ludendorff unsuccesfully tried to overthrow the Republic

* 9/11/1925 - Hitler founds the SS

* 9/11/1944 - German chemist Otto Hahn is awarded the Nobel Prize for his discoveries in splitting heavy atoms - after the US drop two nuclear bombs on Japan, Hahn becomes heavily opposed to nuclear weapons 

* 9/11/1949 - The foreign ministers of Britain, France and the US decide to formally open negotiations to integrate West Germany into a transatlantic and European partnership - concluded in the Petersberg accords

* 9/11/1967 - A protest at Hamburg University, criticizing the new principal for previous Nazi activities, is one of the big starting points of the '68 student movement (giving it one of its most iconic slogans: ""Unter den Talaren, der Muff von tausend Jahren"")

* 9/11/1969 - A radical left group plants a bomb in a Jewish community house in Berlin that doesn't explode - think back to '38 please!

* 9/11/1974 - RAF terrorist Holger Meins dies in prison after two months in hunger strike

* 9/11/2006 - The new synagogue in Munich is inaugurated. Three years earlier, on 9/11/2003, the groundbreaking ceremony was held - which Neonazis tried to target with a massive bomb that would have resulted in heavy casualties. Thankfully that terror plot was thwarted in time.

Many companies in Portugal get entire sectors filled with these unexperienced often incompetent slaves and when the law says it's time to pay them they ditch them and replace them with new ones. The law abides. Sure, it doesn't feel like slave labour for the kid doing the internship (it feels like an internship, whatever that's good for), but from the companies' standpoint they are practicing slave labour.

There *are* abuses of interns, but interships are *not* bad and are certainly not slavery. First off, you have a choice. You can leave at any time. The reason people don't is because most companies aren't interested in hiring people straight out of university.

By that standard, German regular consumption is not alcoholism. We do have alcoholics, but those are few and far in-between. 4% or less is more like it.

Germans being saner around the booze has something to do with that - you can get a beer when you're sixteen, in a relatively controlled environment, you do not have to go binge-drinking age 21 when you're in college far away from home.

Difference I noticed:

Dressing - no real difference it will be always a ""trend"" thingy. And we have cool kids and Goth kids etc. also (we as Germany)...


Right: I felt in America the teenagers did not know so much about their personal right to protect themselves. 


Sex: as I was in MI - a lot of parents were really afraid of having over a boy and meeting with their little girl. However we had to let the door open (in Germany I never experienced that). Americans are a bit more protective or afraid of having an early pregnancy I guess. In Germany I saw most mothers take care of their daughters to tell them how to protect (pill, condoms) and let them do their own thing.

Violence: No real difference besides in Germany we do not have this ""Gang"" culture or not that public at least.

Relationship with parents: I can only talk for myself, but in the USA this was REALLY loving, hugging, telling your mom ""I love you"" and stuff like that. In Germany I at least never said that stuff, it was just natural and did not need to be mentioned. 
I think the American family relationship is mostly more loving than the German ones - even if they feel the same way they do not show it.

I did also noticed that almost all my ex-girlfriends from the usa did get pregnant at the age between 16 and 20. I only have one friend in Germany which got her Kid at the age of 17. (personally know).

I have done two internships so far and a third one lined up next year, one of them in a government agency, all unpaid. This is unfortunately more common than not. It's a basic ""trade-off"" kinda thing: either you have a lot of internship opportunities, but unpaid, or only few and far in between, but paid. It is definitely a problem that internships are expensive to do, but often required to find jobs later on, as you probably know.

What you could try is to find a programme in e. g. Germany that offers financial help to unpaid internships for foreigners. The German Academic Exchange Service ([link](http://www.daad.de/en/)) might have something for you, or can direct you into the right direction to find something.

&gt;In October 2010, a French pensioner chased after 
a Muslim woman around a shop, ripping her 
niqab and proclaiming that such garments should 
be banned in France. The attacker, a retired 
female teacher, was tried and ordered to pay 800 
Euros in damages to the victim, a citizen of the 
United Arab Emirates

&gt;More than 30 tombstones were knocked down 
or broken, and swastikas were drawn on the 
gravel paths at a Muslim cemetery in 
Strasbourg, France, on September 23, 2010. 
The local mayor denounced the vandalism as 
an “unbearable racist act.” Local religious 
leaders attributed the act to the extreme right 
movement.

&gt;Authorities in France do not report explicitly on violence against Muslims, but their reporting of racist and 
xenophobic hate crimes offers a window into the problem of anti-Muslim violence, with 33 percent of 
reported incidents perpetrated against people of North African (Maghreb) origin, who are predominantly
Muslim. In 2009, authorities reported 1, 026 racist or xenophobic hate crimes, a 219 percent increase from 
2008 (467).

&gt; However, the authorities are considering a second scenario with larger deductions: 5% (instead of 2%) for pensions from 700 to 1,000 euro, 8% (instead of 3%) for pensions from 1,000.01 to 1,300 euro, 10% (instead of 5%) for pensions from 1,300.01 to 1,600 euro, 12% (instead of 10%) for pensions from 1,600.01 to 2,000 euro and 15% (as in the first scenario) for pensions of 2,000 euro and more. Plan B will affect pensions from 700 to 2,000 euro the most, which the majority of pensioners receive, and thus more costs to the insurance funds will be saved. For example, a pensioner receiving a pension of 1,050 euro will lose 31.5 euros per month according to the first scenario and according to the second - 84 euro per month. Twice more money will be lost for the pensions of 1,400 euro, since according to the first scale the loss would amount to 70 euro, and according to the second - 140 euro a month.

Which wasn't that far away from what I remembered (I'm pretty sure the original proposal didn't have any cuts for under 1000 EUR and had a total cap for pensions at around 1500 or 2000 EUR, but I can't find the link anymore to support this). 

Now again: it'd be nice if you people would stop claiming that it's the eeeevil Troika that force your politicians to do deplorable things to you, when in fact you just get fucked over by your own people (like since forever, so you should be used to it by now).

http://religion.blog.lemonde.fr/2011/11/29/des-profanations-de-lieux-de-culte-en-forte-progression-depuis-2008/

In 2011, 434 desecrations of Christian sites, 41 of Muslim sites, 34 of Jewish sites. While I'm pretty certain much of the Christian desecrations are by Metalhead types (I'm a metalhead myself), with still a significant amount of Muslim perpetrators, I'm also pretty sure most Jewish desecrations are due to Muslims.

Also, one may want to take into account that crimes committed against whites are rarely considered hate crimes. One may also keep in mind that theses Arab hoodlums, when caught in a fight, systematically blame racism. I have no sources for that, it's simply my experience. When they start a fight and the police catches them, they claim the fight was started because they were called ""dirty Arabs"" or something, although this is often false. Again, I have no sources. It's just my experience, and it's pretty obvious to me.. not that it's always the case. There are of course moments of real racism. But I'd be willing to bet my life that more assaults are committed on whites for racist reasons, than on Arabs by whites for racist reasons. But racist crimes against whites are rarely reported as hate crimes.

I always find it difficult to speak about this with people who's country doesn't have a massive Muslim population. Because they don't know how it is.

Während des Lösungsprozesses konnte festgestellt werden, dasss es den Ausstiegswilligen schwerfällt, sich vollkommen von den linksextremistischen Kontakten zu lösen, da sie darüber hinaus kaum über soziale Kontakte außerhalb der Szene verfügen. In solchen Fällen kann das Aussteigerprogramm ein wichtiges Hilfsmittel darstellen. Es unterstützt Ausstiegswillige mit Ratschlägen und dient als Gesprächspartner.

Contrived much? 

I do however take your point, but you'd have to ask yourself how the system allowed such situtations to arise. To continue your example is rationing there because the country is at war (e.g. during the UK in WW2) or because the ""government"" has fucked things up (e.g. China &amp; Russia under ""communism"")?

&gt; he doesn't resent the imposition on his right to volunteer to slave for 60 hours a week for a pittance because no-one actually wants to do that, only the vast disparity of power means that some people are forced to.

If he doesn't want to engage in the work he doesn't have to. There are consequences those actions though. If the system allows free riders then it is in all likelihood unsustainable and either the ""state"" has power over him or something else does. I'd suggest your problem is not with capitalism since it provides the individual with a great deal of power over themself, but it does (in your view no doubt) disproportionately reward those who conform to the adapted norms i.e. get educated, get a job and chances are over your life cycle you'll be reasonably comfortable.

Firstly, why or how did Tesco manage to buy the land for a purpose built care home? That reeks of corruption (or stupidity) if the land was owned by the council. 

Secondly, and a bit disineguously I must admit, how do we know that the wants of those tens of thousands are the right ones to be worried about? A significantly larger group could be affected positively by Tesco being there. I doubt either of us are able to categoricaly prove one way or the other and this in itself is a problem and one which highlights the issue of only ""local"" people affecting their environment.

There are always a lot more stakeholders than meets the eye, the simple example is a river. Several tribes want to use the water along the course of the river but each has different wants and needs and these cannot always be amicably reconciled so who has the ""right"" to use it? Our history suggests the ones with the biggest sticks or alternatively the ones with the resources to ""buy"" out the ""rights"" of the other tribes though a means of exchange.

No I don't care about that sort of minor inequality. I care about the fact that capitalism allows people to purchase labour which means that they can then accumulate for themselves the exclusive exchange rights over more property than a single individual can themselves produce. This inevitably allows for those with sufficient wealth to purchase enough labour to have a sort of endless accumulation machine in which the wealth they accumulate produced by purchased labour can be used to purchase more labour that produces more wealth over which they have the ownership rights and so on. This inevitably leads to gross disparities which have absolutely nothing to do with any kind of merit, it's a function of the system itself.

No doubt there is a myriad of issues but as you point out they are in temporary housing so ok, not great on a personal level but yay the system is working to some extent.

The question is, do the people accepting minimum wage jobs feel they realistically could just ""not"" accept the job (since the renumeration isn't worth the work or whatever economic calculation you might make)? I would argue that they don't. To say ""well they will get temporary housing from the government"" isn't going to make them feel any less pressed upon in the negotiation between labour and capital.

&gt;While we are far from a meritocratic world I doubt that in the West there are 1,000 families that have the kind of longevity you're talking about. The Rothschilds maybe and a few others. Wealth is a lot more fluid over time. The ""grossly"" wealthy like Bill Gates and Warren Buffet have made their own fortunes in their own lifetimes. One might argue that what they have done is due to merit, both are evidently intelligent men who have made the most of the situations they are in. And yes luck played a part in it.

Social mobility has no bearing on the issue. Capital has to some extent managed to divorce itself from individuals through the joint-stock phenomenon, that the concentration of power is mobile and the holders can change doesn't change the fact it's a ridiculous concentration in the hands of a few.

Furthermore those who are successful are inevitably always the vast minority. There cannot be even 1 billion Buffets in the world, even if everyone was brilliant, the proportions of successful people would be similar - the overall productivity is irrelevant because it's again an issue of the way power, wealth and so on are distributed across the population not the absolute amount any given individual has.

&gt;Capitalism does not need endless growth but it is the preferred system. You'll note that the global economy has been not expanding for a fair few years now but the system persists!

It needs it in the sense that it starts to fail quite badly (most importantly, the reason we accept these accumulations of capital is that when it is invested, with the purpose of further accumulation of course, it benefits us locally - with jobs or higher wages or cheaper stuff or whatever) when it isn't growing the incentive for investment is taken out, which slows further accumulation but also makes us lose those benefits that we do get from capitalism.

Environmental issues are always something to deal with, but in a non growth scenario once dealt by some specific solution the problem is solved.

true,Gandzilla,null,null,"keep in mind, that it heavily depends on where in germany and the US Luwi00 was living.

Like in the US, someone living in rural Bavaria has a complete different experience than in Berlin and so on.

In general, germans (especially former western germany) are a culture that is actually quite close to the US. Whether that came from the US using us as a buffer towards the east or whether it is due to the german influence on the US before WW2 i'm not entirely sure

To extend on Luwi00's thoughts:

* Dressing: Agree, same thing

* Rights: People in the US are A LOT more touchy if they feel like they rights are not beeing kept. I suppose it comes from the entire sueing culture the US established. From my experience people are a lot more likely to just let is slide if they feel like the service in a restaurant was bad, rather than very verbally complaining about it.

* Sex: Agree. Keep in mind the german FKK culture had a heavy impact on our parents generation. It was not that uncommon to e.g. go to a lake for bathing and everyone is completely naked. contraception is a lot more common, especially the ""pille"" (anti baby pill for girls)

* Violence: There's a MASSIVE difference. Keep in mind that violent movies are a lot more restricted in germany. Video game laws are a little bit softer now but e.g. Team Fortress 2 the enemies ""explode"" into rubber ducks in the german version. Movies like the Texas chain saw massacre or from dusk till dawn are 18+ and are severely cut for normal releases. Heck even N64 golden eye was not available publicly in germany since you shot at humans, which would have been 18+. I had never seen a gun before I moved to michigan, where I would have been able to buy shotguns at Wall Mart at 2:00 am ...

* Relationship with parents: Heavily depends on the family but I think that's right. I think germany is a lot more about ""letting your kids fly"" earlier. Most teenagers start working at 16/17 and quite a few move out of home as part of that. You can drink, you (used to) are able to smoke, latest at 18 the majority of germans are entirely earning their own money and living on their own. (even if they stay around their hometown)

* Pregnancy: It's not only pregnancy but also mariage. Americans, especially from the mid west I guess, seem to get married/knocked up earlier than germans. I don't know anyone in Germany at my age (27) that has a kid yet but the majority of my US Highschool friends is married, some having already multiple children. My guess it's related to, at the end of highschool you have the choice of: you marry your highschool sweetheart or you move to different colleges and never see each other again. The german system is a little bit more open than that. Also: Contraception as mentioned above.

Otehr differences:

* Germans are a lot less ""competetive"" than Americans. Every time people in the US seem to want to do drinking competitions, eating competitions, racing, sports, whatever to show that they win. Due to how sports are introduced in germany (school class, mainly a social experience) it's a lot different from the US school spirit, our school is winning, We are #1 hammering,

* National Pride: Pretty much non-existent in germany (except for things like food/beer or our soccer team, not for the country itself)

* Driving: While driving 1-2 hours in rural, and even in populated areas of the US doesn't seem to be that big of a deal, it is in Germany. I come from a rural area roughly 50 minutes from Frankfurt, but we rarely ever went to Frankfurt. In michigan it took us 40 minutes just to get where we wanted to hang out and it was normal.

* Police: Police in germany is a lot less ""agressive""/""intimidating"" as US police is pictured. tbh, in my like a dozen, trips to the US i never even talked to a police officer so can't tell whether that is the case

* Tipping: You tip your waiter if you feel like you got good service. Tipping is 5-10% maximum. Usually rounded to an even number (33,50€ -&gt; 35€ is ok)

* Thinking globally: That is one thing that the US is pictured worse than it is. I think the average person does not think outside of the US much, but there are many people that are indeed aware that there is life outside of the great U S of A. I would guess the average person in germany is more aware of global things, mainly due to the proximity of other countries and our news media beeing slightly less biased, but you have bad eggs everywhere. Also, keep in mind, Lots of germans also couldn't pinpoint where exactly Iran or Iraq is. Media coverage of the US is fairly good though.

* thinking long term: again, depends on it. I would put germans more towards the open minded person in the US like Californians of New Yorkers, rather than Texans or, in general, Mid-westerners. But it's not like everyone lives for the future

* hmm, what else, Vacation: Germans, in general, have quite a bit more vacation and a lit higher job security than americans. It is considered that it's better to have vacation and be at work fully rested than to work non-stop and burn yourself out.

* Complimenting/small talk: Keep in mind that Germans don't quite overexteragate like a lot of americans do. If something is good. there's nothing to complain about it. It doesn't need to be amazing, great, unbelieveable! You don't greet random people with ""wie gehts (how are you?)"" and most germans will either be put off why one would ask them that or they will reply onestly and say, ah, I am kinda tired, it's been a long day, also my car broke down last week so ,.......

* Beeing on time: yes please

* a little bit more honest: I've never been invited to BBQ at someone's place (except for close friends), but if someone invites you, it's very likely that he will stick to this promise. I can't count the times of people inviting me to have a bbq with them next time I am in the US, yet I've only been to one.

Keep in mind, most of this is personal experience and personal oppinion and by no means ment to be fully representative of everyone :)

true,Asyx,NRWW,Nordrhein-Westfalen,"Disclaimer: I've never been in the US so I'll just try to explain how I've experienced stuff. If I completely missed the point somewhere, please tell me.

It's probably not the colour you wear but there are districts where I wouldn't want to be at night as a German. I know that Lebanese and Tunisians have some conflicts from time to time in Gelsenkirchen (that's somewhere in the west near Düsseldorf. Probably very unknown outside of that area). Same goes for some east German cities with the ""traditional racism"". But I think you're fairly save in general. I don't have problems being alone outside at night here and everybody knows what you should avoid at night. And that might sound harder than I thought it would. I don't mean that we have ghettos where you shouldn't be as a German or immigrant. It's just that you're more likely to get in trouble there and I'd call the trouble maker a bunch of idiots and not a gang. 

**To the relationship thing**: After certain age, it's just very rare to tell your mun that you love her or to hug or whatever. I mostly do that when I noticed my mum had a rough day at work because I know that would cheer her up. That could be related to the fact that Germans don't get driven to school that much (since our public transport system is more reliable and sometimes faster than a car) so they are a lot more independent on that matter. Most people start to take the bus to school when they're 11 years old since that's when you get into secondary school and primary schools are mostly spread around a district so it's easy to reach them by foot or bike. We also can go out at 16 since that's the legal drinking age. German teenagers have more opportunities to get away from their parents and might get independent a lot faster because of that. But that's just speculation and what I've experienced with myself. When I could go out at night, I was seeing my parents a lot less and I was a lot closer with my friends.

**The sex thing**: When I was 13 and the parents of my girlfriend were out, they've spread condoms around the flat so no matter where we would try to get it on, there were always condoms in our point of view. Well, they still were kind of relieved when no condom was missing when they came back... 

So I think parents are still very protective but I think the ""better in the save environment of home than somewhere else""-mentality is very common here. I was allowed to drink when I had parties at home with friends before it was legal and also to smoke. My mum just thought it's a lot saver when we couldn't go crazy with that stuff at home and if I don't smoke outside since that could get legal problems. And I think parents would rather have their daughter/son having sex with somebody at home where they can spread condoms everywhere or place them sneaky in the teenagers room than on a party. At least the parents I know knew that it was impossible to stop your children without them hating you.

**Maturity** is probably very hard to categorise. I knew people that did crazy and dangerous and completely childish stuff with 16 but I also knew people that were like young adults should be.

**Rights**: As far as I know, Germany has a lot more rights for teenagers than the USA. We know when we can drink what and drive and smoke. We know when we can vote for what. We know what we can buy (there are certain levels of how able you are to make a contract). We know how long we're allowed to be outside and we know about the self defence laws. Most of that stuff get's taught in school. I think German teenagers mostly know about the rights they should know about.

**Slut shaming**... what's that exactly? As a guy, that's something I can't really talk about. I always thought that's non of my business what the girls do and so did the one that got called a slut by other girls. In my secondary school class, people that ran around calling other girls slut where mostly those kind of people nobody in their right mind wanted to deal with on a regular basis. But my secondary school class was very mature compared to what I've heard about other schools.

**Thinking long term**: Hmmm... I'd say most people knew what they were going to do later in life. Teachers are very demanding on that topic. They want to know what you plan after secondary school. They push you to find an apprenticeship if you don't want to go to college. Germans might have another view on **global things** since we're used to being around other countries. I think in a country as big as the US, teenagers could easily forget about the rest of the world.

I think our school system certainly helps with maturity. You have to make important decisions fairly early in life. Our school system works like that: primary school (age 6-11), secondary school (age 11-16), college (age 16-19), university (I think there is no age range. You can find everything from 19 to 40).

Teachers prepare you for that. After secondary school, you can do college or an apprenticeship. Apprenticeships are a proper higher education as well. You can earn a lot of money with them and it's not easy to switch your profession. They're like a more focused degree for one profession ranging from a common brick layer to an electronics engineer for automation. Since it's such an important decision, teachers and parents make you think about your future.

And that's some damn long comment and probably not the answer you want. Please tell me if your teenage years were different. I can only talk for myself. I'd also like to know how teenagers actually are in the US. You watched the wave, I watched American Pie and that's probably not accurate.

**Edit to the sex thing**: We've got the teenager magazine ""Bravo!"" which deals with common teenager problems. They've got a category called ""Dr. Sommer"" where teenagers can ask questions about their problems (mostly sexual) and they try to answer those questions in a professional way. Sexual education in school and that magazine were a damn good resource for all sorts of questions on that matter. Do you've got something like that in the US?

Wealth is power and the ability to patronise. The problem with capitalism is not that it's more corrupt, it's that it distributes the power and ability to patronise in a way that disadvantages the vast majority against the very few.

EU says cut, you want to be within the EU (without even taking a chance of threatening an exit), you cut. 

What makes this even more preposterous  is that farming areas voted overwhelmingly right wing (there has been analysis after analysis of the last elections), mostly for religious reasons. Effectively, the poorest of the poor voted for their pensions to be cut. It's barbaric.

Also, there is a very good reason for politicians to want to avoid that:

1: Because it's never black &amp; white. Politics are way more complex than we think, and just blaming shit on the muslims will solve absolutely nothing. Some people refer to it as ""Political Correctness"", i ususally just call it ""rational thinking"". The problems facing the muslims and us are not only due to their culture and religion, but also due to living conditions, white privilege, economic situations etc. 

And as a politician, you can't just ban Muslim stuff. You can't say ""Muslims are not allowed to..."" That's bloody apartheid and certainly nothing to strive for. You have to have a good reason, other than just generally disliking it. We tolerate Neo-Nazis, so we must also tolerate some things about muslims that we don't like.

2: If you want to keep an open debate, you have to be civilized. If you want people to listen to you, then you must have a point to make. Saying ""Muslims do not belong here"" will just make you sound like a narrow-minded jerk. It has no value in a debate and will lead you absolutely nowhere. Saying ""We will not change our ways to better fit Islam"" is much more open minded and show that you are actually open to be talked to.

Just like you have the right to say what you want, so do i have the right to completely ignore the fuck out of you (Not you specifically). So if i feel that i'm talking to someone who have made up his mind and nothing can ever change his mind, then i will not listen to him. Politics require communication, thus that kind of mindset is not possible.

Because Muslims are not a race the systemic violations directed against them cannot be racially motivated. Because Muslims are not a race their subjugation is not racism. Thus most themes associated with previous expressions of racism can be (and increasingly are) brought back into style. Muslim extremists can join the Black mugger, the Gypsy thief, the Jewish anarchist… as the stars of racism’s narratives. Expertly opined, scientifically classified and institutionally enshrined, Muslims are inserted into a pubic discourse as almost isomorphic replacements for previous arch-villains of racist anxieties and fantasies. The Muslim as super-villain (and its always, of course, a “he”- since there are no Muslim women- except those waiting to be rescued by strong white arms) can help mend the holes in the tattered fabric of the old style racism which struggles of various anti-colonial and civil rights movements in various parts of the world had done so much to rip to shreds.

Islamophobia has been presented as nothing as sordid as racism, but rather a rational response to real threats to Western, nay, universal values,. As even the BNP knows Muslims are not a race.

Good point. Sarkosy's presidency was mixed on this issue. He did do the whole Niquab thing (which officially has nothing to do with Islam, the law is about concealing your face in public and while driving), but he also appointed someone to represent the Muslims of France in front of the government, which I don't think we needed. They're citizens like everyone else, they have senators, mayors, etc, to represent them, just like every other French citizen. That is mainly the cause of my concern.

Regarding your points one and two, I completely agree on that. You also have to look at history to see a pretty good example of what's happenning today. Christianity didn't accept to live in a secular state overnight. It took century, and there were civil wars about it (in France). You can't expect the transition to go smoothly for Islam.

true,atheistmil,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; The question is, do the people accepting minimum wage jobs feel they realistically could just ""not"" accept the job (since the renumeration isn't worth the work or whatever economic calculation you might make)? I would argue that they don't.

Why do you feel they don't? A small minority of welfare recipients evidently do the calculation and decide that it is worthwhile. They accept a much reduced lifestyle compared to the average in return for the ability to not work. 

We all have made the choice to do what we do, if we accept a minimum wage job it is because we believe it to be better than the alternative. It maybe social pressures rather than economic that force it but that is not the fault of capitalism.

What would your realisitc alternative be?

&gt; There cannot be even 1 billion Buffets in the world, even if everyone was brilliant, the proportions of successful people would be similar

Not necessarily, if everyone was brilliant there would be less inequality since for sake of argument if everyone was a doctor or lawyer then while there are wage inequalities they are not as extreme as say welfare and investment banker.

Capitalism has been around for a long time and there have been periods even in living memory where wealth inequality was less than it is now. The issue now is the ability to globalise and what this means for those who are able to play on a global stage. Yes, they can control more assets than they could historically but again, this is not a direct consequence of capitalism it is more a case of globalisation. 

&gt; It needs it in the sense that it starts to fail quite badly (most importantly, the reason we accept these accumulations of capital is that when it is invested, with the purpose of further accumulation of course, it benefits us locally - with jobs or higher wages or cheaper stuff or whatever) when it isn't growing the incentive for investment is taken out, which slows further accumulation but also makes us lose those benefits that we do get from capitalism.

I presume you are familar with the concept of an economic cycle? There are phases where people make a lot of losses, so I'm not quite sure what your point is. We do many things with the intention of it benefitting our circumstance but not everything does. The same is true for Moaist China and Russia with thier respective plans for growth. They didn't set out to starve 30 million people.

&gt; but in a non growth scenario once dealt by some specific solution the problem is solved.

Your use of growth here is a bit ambiguous, do you mean economic growth or population growth? There are lots of areas we could grow which cause environmental issues.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;You could say the same for any system that allows power to be concentrated even in the slightest.

Not really. Minor inequalities have much less effect. If I have slightly more power than my neighbour on account of my being more persuasive or caring more about some issue or having some bit of dirt against my neighbour, it might be a bad thing (it's arguable either way) but it's not going to cause one class of society to have effectively dictatorial power over the entire governance of that society, even if that situation is replicated over and over across the country.

&gt;Rubbish! People can and do come together on a global scale to achieve many things. The problem typically is that when people come together (e,g, Occupy) they lack coherence and a single vision. Charities manage to work globally and have vast influence and they are not exactly instruments of capitalism.

Huh, charities often _are_ instruments of capitalism... and they are certainly not opposed to it.

People coming together on a global scale to achieve things requires organisation, to pretend that when they've done so with agendas that are undesirable to the capitalist class that they haven't been actively and fiercely opposed by a group who have more power than them is disingenuous. Even with something so harmless as _e.g. Occupy_ there has been all kinds of ridiculous opposition.

But of course I believe that if people genuinely came together they would have ultimately more power than the capitalist class - that's because in the end, power is not just wealth, ""ownership"" is just a game and when it doesn't benefit society we don't have to and shouldn't play by it's rules. However if we were to play by it's rules that power people absolutely actually have would be meaningless and unusable. That is why socialism is not just a pipe dream, as soon as people want to stop playing by rules of a game rigged against them they actually have the power to do so.

&gt;So by your standards what is a reasonable level of inequality?

I think it would be difficult to quantify it objectively. But I don't think any single person should be able to accumulate more of society's wealth than a single person (including a single person working co-operatively as part of a massive enterprise, not just a single person isolated and alone) can themselves produce.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;A small minority of welfare recipients evidently do the calculation and decide that it is worthwhile.
If you refuse a job on welfare you lose your benefits... how can you make that choice?

&gt;What would your realisitc alternative be?

To what specifically? How to force people to work? I don't think the problem with the situation in question is actually that people are forced to work. If work needs doing and that's the only way to get it done it's fair enough, I don't even have a problem with withdrawal of vital resources as the incentive. The problem here is that the work is not being done for the benefit of society as a whole (though it may benefit society as a whole indirectly, and it also might not) but for the benefit of the profit making entity doing the employing. In capitalism the purpose of production is accumulation for it's own sake by a small minority of the population and by accumulation they increase their power over the rest of us. We not only are forced to work, but we are forced to work for our further disenfranchisement.

&gt;Not necessarily, if everyone was brilliant there would be less inequality since for sake of argument if everyone was a doctor or lawyer then while there are wage inequalities they are not as extreme as say welfare and investment banker.

If everyone was a doctor or lawyer there could be no capitalism (or indeed any other economic system).

&gt;Capitalism has been around for a long time and there have been periods even in living memory where wealth inequality was less than it is now. The issue now is the ability to globalise and what this means for those who are able to play on a global stage. Yes, they can control more assets than they could historically but again, this is not a direct consequence of capitalism it is more a case of globalisation.

Inequality during capitalism has been lowest when capital was weak and labour was strong and taxes were high and spent on things that benefited most people. However the tendency of capitalism to produce inequality was always there, and those periods cannot last, profit rates decline, then investment declines and the power of labour must be checked to bring profits back up to a functional level and make investment worthwhile. If I thought capitalism could sustain social democracy I'd support it, but all evidence shows capitalism cannot, it ends up having to tear down that stuff and go back to it's roots.

&gt;I presume you are familar with the concept of an economic cycle? There are phases where people make a lot of losses, so I'm not quite sure what your point is. 

Yes and... all I am saying is that despite economic cycles to sustain itself capitalism requires growth.

&gt;Your use of growth here is a bit ambiguous, do you mean economic growth or population growth? There are lots of areas we could grow which cause environmental issues. Should we implement population caps?

Population growth obviously requires economic growth if standards of living are to remain stable but mainly I refer to the former (the latter being pulled in by the second statement).

I think it would be wise to control population but I don't think caps are necessarily the best way to do so.

The implication you put across is that there is no prexisting disparity of power between classes, the thing I am arguing is precisely that there is.

I would define harm as physical in the traditional sense of the term.

&gt;Is harm in your argument only something directly attributable to the chemical function of the substance?

I was using my terms somewhat loosely not anticipating an argument, but broadly so yes. While I do agree that severe psychological damage or neurological damage at low dosage can be termed ""harmful"", I still think that given the relative immunity of humans to negative effects from MDMA, describing it as harmful is at least excessive.

&gt;Is the rich kid who can be on MDMA every day without fear of losing a job, money or a house to live in experiencing any harm?

Possibly, people respond differently to MDMA intake, but it certainly interferes with some people's seratonin production and the way the brain reacts to it (then again, so do SSRI's, with fairly poor clinical evidence that they're beating placebos, depending on the region you look at).

Harmful in a meaningful sense to me is - if you take it is there a chance it'll physically damage you up in the immediate case, or in the long term as a result of ingestion. It's worth noting though that I was using this as a relative term (as all terms are, context is always with us), and in comparison to most other illegal and legal recreational drugs the harm level of MDMA is incredibly, incredibly low (way below say, fatty foods, crossing the road without looking, even flying in an airplane).

edit: If you want to get scientific we could *attempt* to talk about things like LD_50, or EC_50 - but oral LD50 in humans isn't known. It's known to be several hundred mg/kg in rats, which is huge.

One misconception that seems to be prevalent is that a capitalistic society is an individualist society. It isn't, we're all humans, we all work not only for our own good but also for the good of our relatives and close friends (the greater good). Government intervention doesn't change this.

In a more capitalistic society there are people who work all their lives to provide for their children even though they know their children will have a brighter and better future than their own. If you thought that people only cared for themselves and or that they cared equally about them and their children, this would be an irrational behaviour as they're giving money away and/or investing more money to their children than the money they're spending on themselves even though money is more valuable now than it is in the future.

In a more socialist society, while income might be redistributed by the government and to all members of society, while we're all still humans and still work a lot to those who are closer to us, we end up not being able to provide as much (in absolute terms) as the government takes away part our income to redistribute it as it sees fit. And, quite frankly, it's the close relatives that matter the most.. I for one never heard anyone said they gladly paid a lot in taxes because those taxes helped people they never even met - and for those who do enjoy to spend a lot of money on absolute random strangers, there's always charity.",0,1352487303,null,0,false,0,c6ywpy9,t3_12v9i1,t1_c6ywpy9,t1_c6ysrmf,null,1430363294,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,whatlad,ENGL,England,"You make a good point about Capitalists not necessarily being self-centred, and also about family and friends coming before the state itself.

However, when everybody pulls in the same direction in agreement, we reach a point where everybody's physical and emotional needs can be met. including yours, your family and friends, and their family and friends and so on.

the barrier to this for now is money. money is what makes you want to earn more of it so that your family and friends are in a better position than somebody else with less money. it is your motivation to succeed. society is not ready to move to pure socialism or to remove the dividing obstacle of money. there would be chaos.

for now, we need socialist capitalism. ie, the regulating of the market so that it can reward money to as many people as possible according to their effort and ability. when you don't regulate the market with that goal in mind (as has stopped happening), you then leave it to the more powerful (more money) being able to suppress the less powerful (less money) without allowing ability or effort to play a part

as for charity, for as long as you need money to preserve your own world, there will be a limit to how much you can provide for other people's worlds. usually (as we see), not enough.",0,1352487970,null,0,false,0,c6ywwpl,t3_12v9i1,t1_c6ywwpl,t1_c6ywpy9,null,1430363366,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

a lot of the horrible things that have or could be done to slaves make it a sensitive topic, i understand that. and to brand an existence like ours with the same word is offensive in that context. but if you do not work, you perish. thus, you are forced to work. if your work provides you with only just enough to keep you alive so that you can continue to work, you are a slave. it's infinitely nicer than it could be, but it still is.

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;Ask him to define what is ""natural"" and then what ""social bias"" is. After that, have a talk about sexuality in the Ancient world and how the Abrahamic religions shaped society. Then you should talk about the Kinsey report and about viewing sexuality as a spectrum instead of something of fixed boundaries.
&gt;
&gt;While you're at it, explain to him the differences between Lamarckism and Darwinism. 

Yeah, the Ancient world is also a good example of how it's natural. As for the Abrahamic religions, he might be religious and so if the issue comes up again, I won't mention it because I don't want to nag him too much because this is hardly relevant and we spend a lot of time together.

As for the Kinsey report, I don't know what that is, google tells me it's a book about human sexuality experiments but I never read it nor do I intend to, so I can't really speak about what I don't know.

With regards to Lamarckism and Darwinism, I know the basics and the idea behind Darwinism and I just googled Lamarckism and, yeah, I've thought about that as well, it makes sense, kids whose parents got into sports tend to also be better at sports while kids whose parents are accountants tend to be better at maths, and it's not only related to the upbringing as the education is the same. But then again, I don't know how to fit homosexuality in here nor how I'd use that in an argument. As I've said in the previous post, this isn't a strong issue for me as I don't think I've ever seen straight up homophobia in my life and the colleague I mentioned said he also didn't have any problem with accepting it, he just said he thought it was unnatural and gross whereas I told him I didn't have problems with it and that it's normal, that homosexuality also happens in animals and that half of the world population likes dick, if someone of those happen to be a man, what's wrong it it?
