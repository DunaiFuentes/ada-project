true,we_who_love_freedom,null,null,"Apologies for taking a while to reply, I've had to work this weekend. I am not going to tackle all of your points individually.  Instead, I am going to give you what you want and show you how it plays out. 

The first sentence of the first point is where you lost all credibility in your conclusions.  When I use words like 'total economic collapse' I do not use them lightly; they aren't exaggerations to make a point sound stronger than it is for rhetoric purposes.  Without the bank bailout, Ireland would have experienced 'total economic collapse'.  There is a misconception, especially among the 'Occupy' crowd, that the bailout happened to protect the assets of Bank CEOs and other 'fatcats' at the expense of the people.  This is absolutely wrong.  All 6 banking institutions here in Ireland, from BoI to EBS Building Society were over-extended into bad debt loans in the housing sector both to private mortgage-holders and to developers; the former who were defaulting on their mortgages, and the latter who were defaulting on the loans creating whole developments.  The damages caused by these defaults would have been fatal, had it been allowed to occur.  You must remember that banks cannot create money on their own, so whatever money they have comes either from depositors, which is the largest source, and funds raised through trade on the markets or through fee, which is smaller. In all cases, Irish banks had way more loans than deposits; for example, Anglo had 183% more loans than deposits, as the worst offender. When these loans went bad, the banks took huge losses, and what this means to the depositor is that if the bank fails, they lose all the assets they have tied up in it.  So the bank bailout was actually a protector for the people--had the banks failed, all depositors across Ireland would have lost their money, and had depositors lost their money, the entire economy of Ireland would have collapsed. I don't know if you studied the Great Depression in the States for your leaving cert, but the breadlines and mass poverty that happened there in the 30's would have been a reality in Ireland had the 'stinker' of a bailout not happened.  This is not exaggeration. 

That said, lets see how the position you are advocating plays out if you have your way.  So, to begin, let's follow the newest trend in Europe and reject austerity, shall we? We'll run the nation exactly like Mr. Hollande, the Greeks, and a couple of parties in Germany want.  And, since we are taking this position, let's also reject the Treaty. After all, it's forced austerity isn't it?  

Yay!!! No more austerity.  No more reduced spending.  No more restriction on expenditure more than revenue.  No more IMF/EU telling us how to spend our euros. We're totally independent from all. Happy Days. 

Okay, so now we need to grow economically, and to do that we need to spend.  The first problem is, how are we going to pay for it?  The 'austerity budget' we were running was an 8.6% deficit in 2012, which we only arrived at because we claimed we could achieve export-led growth and reduce some of our expenditure.  Now that we can spend as we please, we are going to want to spend even more, so we are going to run an even bigger deficit than 8.6%, so lets say 18.6% for 2013, as a reasonable example.  We're going to use this money to inject into the economy to create an economic stimulus and to provide assistance to the people. 

But because it's a deficit, it means that for every euro we spend over our revenue, we have to borrow it.  From where shall we borrow?  We can't borrow from the markets, since our holdings became functionally worthless when we took the bailout.  Only BoI has been able to generate some equity interest.  Nobody else is interested.  We can't issue sovereign bonds because both the rejection of the treaty and the fragile state of the economy in Ireland signalled to potential investors that those bond yields might fail.  If anybody is interested, they'll be at ridiculously high interest rates much like the Greek bonds were before their crisis.  We can't borrow from the IMF/EU because we rejected the terms of their bailout, which was budgetary restriction, and also because we rejected their Treaty through which they wanted fiscal accountability. To my knowledge, there's literally nowhere left to turn.  Correct me if I'm wrong here. 

But for the sake of argument, let's assume Ireland somehow manages to acquire the funding.  Now, what shall we do with it? The first question is whether we will continue to make the interest payment on the loans we do have.  That payment at the moment requires 25% of our revenue.  Scenario A says, 'No Way' and stops making the payment.  Ireland defaults on the loan, and Ireland leaves the Euro. We go back to minting punts and we come up with a new currency.  Maybe the Irish pound or something. Now this will probably hurt our exports as the new currency faces evaluation in the markets, plus the inherent instability it holds in the eyes of Europe who just witnessed us default.  Not only this, but do you think anyone is going to buy any Irish bonds, loan to or take loans from Irish banks, or spend any money in FDI in Ireland when they have a very reasonable expectation that they could lose everything?  Ireland would be essentially cut off from international financing of any sort. 

Scenario B says we continue to make the payment. This is a better choice IMHO and sends the message that we aren't totally worthless.  But as a consequence of borrowing more money than we were, 10% of GDP more to be precise, in order to increase our spending, our loan obligation increases too.  What was 25% of revenue will begin to slip toward 30%, and the longer we borrow the higher it goes.  We may be able to counter this to some degree through economic expansion, but by and large economic growth will not outpace the obligations created by the borrowing to fund it.  I have in another post shown the mathematical relationship between budgetary position, servicing of debt, and economic growth.  I am not going to go into it here, but suffice to say, that a significant rate, relative to GDP, of expenditure to service debt combined with a significant budget deficit, make growth targets impossible to reach, unless we are in China and can achieve double digit growth.  This fact creates perpetual debt--we can't grow enough to maintain a debt equilibrium, and as such debt continues to mount annually until we either default in making the payment or trigger economic collapse trying to make it.  

This is the consequence of rejecting 'austerity'.  The very means of relieving the burden created by reduced expenditure will have the opposite effect of what is intended. 

Now we do agree about Ireland's debt levels.  They are unsustainable. I don't know if you intend to burn the bond holders to relieve it as they did in Greece, which is deplorable, or try to negotiate for some reduction in interest rate or perhaps a write-off.  This will be a very tough sell if it can be done at all.  If not, I don't see how a problem created by extreme debt can be solved by undertaking more of it.  What is referred to as 'austerity' is actually not; it is a harsh realisation that we have been overspending for a very long time, accompanying a determination to live within our means, even if it makes the going extremely rough for the people. 

The idea behind a 'structural deficit' means that the deficit is adjusted for position in the economic cycle, which is a reference to the Keynesian system you were on about.  As such, the deficit amount is higher in recession phase than in growth phase, because of the adjustment made for the state of the economy.  It does not preclude counter-cyclical spending, which I support by the way. Bertie abandoned this position in 2001 by supporting pro-cyclical policy and spending on average 25% more each year than the year before through 2007, to the extent that a 2007 balanced budget actually produced an 8.75% deficit when adjusted for the instability of assets acquired.  Have a look through the Regling and Watson report on the crisis in Ireland that was written by the IMF as an analysis. 

Lastly, the ESM will be governed by an international group, not by a single individual. It might be 'undemocratic' because it's members are appointed and not elected, but it will still be representative of Europe as a whole. Also, it will maintain an 800bn permanent fund when EFSF expires.  I don't see how maintaining a fund to bail out struggling EU member states and prevent implosion is a bad thing.  Also, please don't reference Youtube in an academic discussion. It totally undermines the impact of your argument. We might as well be talking about Wikipedia. Likewise, the clause was signed as an acknowledgement that if we can't agree to support a common currency, inflation rate, and fiscal policy as part of a union, we shouldn't have access to union funds. It makes total sense.  It makes us accountable.  I hear Sinn Fein arguing about sovereignty, but we gave a lot of this up when we joined the EU, like it or not. As I've stated before, the Treaty is about limiting liability, of keeping one member-state from harming the others and destroying the union.  IMHO if we can't support that, then we shouldn't be in the Eurozone in the first place.",0,1337536286,null,0,1337536725,0,c4q8ueo,t3_ts1tw,t1_c4q8ueo,t1_c4plehm,null,1428963514,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

People go to Klaipeda for even minor surgeries, like appendix removal. This can have influence on the statistics. Also, some regional hospitals don't even perform abortions. at all.

I can see why people assume language will be a big barrier, but in all of my travels that has really never been the case. The biggest thing that will limit your ability to communicate will be you. There are a lot of expats and international workers I see on a regular basis here. There is a clear divide in that group. Those willing to leave their comfort zones and try and those who start every conversation with ""Parli inglese."" I bought a phrase book a few months before I came here and from the moment I left the terminal I tried to speak as much Italian as I could regardless of how stupid I sounded. 

People open up more when you simply try to speak their language. Not many people here speak English enough to have a full on conversation, but enough that if youre struggling they can help or at the very least make sense of what youre saying. Like I said, I have not had a problem so far and the university will have pleanty of people there who can help you with the harder stuff like housing, internet, etc...

Milan is nothing like Rome, so if you're considering Milan based on your experience in Rome youre going to be disappointed. Milan is not the quintessential Italian city. It is much more European and much more modern. There are amazing restaurants, great sites to see, an amazing nightlife scene and a culture that is unique to this city due to its large international population. However, dont expect to turn every corner and see something out of your art history book. With that being said its proximity to the rest of Europe and Italy is second to none. Ive traveled up and down both coasts, sicily and central Italy as well as southern Europe since I have been here. It really is an amazing location. 

I love it here and if I were your age I would not hesitate to come here. The only thing I would do research on is how you will be taught at Poly Milan. I tutor two engineering majors who are learning english so they can pursue masters work in the UK. Their reasoning is because while the theoretical classes are great, the practical labs are seriously lacking and in some cases hindering their ability to find relevant internships for the summer. I dont know enough about this, but would be happy to ask. 

I hope this helps. Really, I can not stress this enough, Communication in a foreign country should not be on the top of your list of concerns.

I think you are very right about how to approach it, language-wise. I will do a lot of studying of Italian this summer, and if I do get the opportunity to visit Milan and/or Turin I will definitely give a good effort to say as little in English as possible.

Do you know if schools have programs where potential students can ""shadow"" other students and live with them for a short period (like a week)? If I were to visit on my own, I might be better off renting a student's couch for a week and living with them, rather than going to a hotel.

true,we_who_love_freedom,null,null,"So, despite the impression that I might be 'frothing at the mouth', I will reply. 

We all agree that growth is good and that it is an excellent way to relieve recession.  In the Keynesian system, economic growth through fiscal expenditure is the mechanism to move from recession to growth phase. 

I have no problem with growth.

Where the problem comes in, as I keep stating, is how it's paid for. As far as the Treaty goes, signing it will only mean that Ireland is forced to reduce it's debt level by 3% a year for the next 20 years and maintain a 1% STRUCTURAL deficit fiscally.  That's all.  

The Treaty, on the other hand, has come to signify the position that Ireland will take toward 'austerity' and budgetary expenditure. If one supports the Treaty, one supports 'austerity' and if one rejects the Treaty, one rejects it.  As much as you think I lump all the Treaty opponents into a single category, you have lumped the idea of the Treaty as significant of it's own accord into two broad but weak categories. 

Nonetheless, I cannot seem to get across the idea of Debt and how much of a problem it is.  If we are to reject the idea of 'austerity' does it not imply that we will resume spending? We are already running an 8.6% deficit this year, down from 10% last year.  Increased spending means increased borrowing, which means an increased deficit. This is the bottom line to growth: we cannot grow without increasing our debt. With the expectation of a 120% debt level, relative to GDP, adding more debt to the burden to fix the solution will not work.  When I say something is 'short-sighted' this is exactly what I mean.  In the short term, sure we can spend on job-creating programs and liquid injection to generate an economic stimulus and it would have a positive effect.  Is it sustainable? Can we grow enough to outpace the added debt that we are undertaking?  The answer to that question is NO. I don't want to go into the whole explanation of the formula, but there is a mathematical relationship between budget position, growth, and rate of debt.  In order to remain debt neutral, or debt equilibrium, that is, not adding more debt, growth and the budget position (deficit or surplus) must equal the percent of GDP spent to service the debt. At 120% debt, Ireland is paying approximately 6.8% of GDP on debt. With a 10% deficit, it must grow 16.8% to balance it, which is impossible. The fact that with a deficit and a high amount of debt we will not have the means to grow creates a system of perpetual debt in which we fail to meet a growth target in one year, which adds debt, and then makes it progressively harder to meet the target the next year. This failure continues until we either default on the servicing payment, or trigger economic collapse trying to pay it. It's that simple.

I mentioned isolation from Europe.  What I meant by this explicitly is a few things. One, if we reject the Treaty, we reject the 12 other member states who have already ratified it.  I think you would say this is a majority of states who support it. Second, I meant we would be joining the likes of Greece who is hardly the role model we should support.  Their corruption, continued mis-handling of funds, and inability to achieve economic prosperity over a long term has resulted in the state their in. At least in Ireland, our problem was created relatively acutely. Likewise, with regard to France, I would be hesitant to side with them.  Outside of Europe, Mr. Hollande's election wasn't greeted with joy, but rather apprehension. Because he is so pronouncedly leftist, he looks to further destabilise an already socially unstable nation.  IMHO the policies he will likely undertake, of increased expenditure for 'social protection', increased taxes, mainly on the rich, and heightened regulation of the economy will not achieve the results he wishes.  Those sorts of 'socialist' or mixed economy endeavours simply don't work in places with more than a small population, and haven't historically.  Sure Scandinavia, with less than 4 million people per nation on average can make it work, even with a 53% tax bracket as in Denmark, but all the large states, from the former USSR to China, fail when they try to function that way, through inherent philosophical and incentive problems with the system itself.  As an example, look that the difference between Hong Kong, which is prosperous, has high wages and social standards, compared to the Mainland which is highly economically stratified, and only being currently buoyed by a construction boom that many see as a bubble.  China is expected to go into recession in the next couple of years. 

With regard to the effects of 'austerity', I have been trying to show that the issue here is debt, and not growth.  We agree that debt and growth do not happen simultaneously, as Finance is implying. In fact, as you showed, all of the Government's figures are overly optimistic and most likely won't reach their targets.  Their method to solve this problem is tantamount to an admission that with the current debt load, it cannot be done; the extent of revenue (25%) that is being spent on paying for the loans is so much that the Government cannot cut enough out of the budget to even begin paying it off.  Instead they are hoping some miraculous growth will occur to fix it for them, despite them working against it.  You mentioned the Eurostat figures, which are significant.  But you misinterpreted them. The fact that Ireland only spends 22% of its GDP on social protection is by itself unimportant. Most states only spend 50% of their GDP annually anyway.  What is important, however, is that of the revenue, between 40 and 50% are spent on social protection, which is consistent with most states across Europe.  Now if you add this 50% of revenue on social protection to a 25% being spent on interest payments, then you get the idea that the whole nation is effectively being run on 25% of tax revenue.  That's an awfully low amount.  How can we ever expect to arrive at a budget surplus without having to cut social expenditure if we maintain such a large amount of debt obligation? We need the surplus to pay off the debt.  Instead, we INCREASE expenditure, we increase our debt obligation, which while it may make things better in the short term, makes it worse in the long. 

These numbers do not lie, and they do not change no matter how we feel about them.  In your reply to me, and in irokie's reply to you, I continue to elicit this emotional response, as if the 'morality' of the situation is more important than its facts.  I have not concerned myself chiefly with how I feel about the problem, or the suffering it has created, or the large amount of emigration out of Ireland that is occurring precisely because the fact that I don't like them any more than anyone else doesn't change the facts as they are.  There are only two ways to deal with this issue, as we have seen: reduce the debt, or grow by adding to it.  This whole 'balanced strategy' thing that was advocated is double-speak, really.  Growth takes money.  One cannot spend money and save it at the same time, unless I am missing something major here.  You advocate adding some sort of 'growth imperative' clause to the treaty, to balance it, so that the EU will be mandated to help it's member states grow, just as it mandates them to maintain a particular fiscal discipline.  There are two ways to do this: either by the ECB directly injecting liquidity into the States' economies, a practice called monetary financing which is expressly banned in Lisbon, or through some other sort of social mechanism which will further undermine sovereignty for those who are concerned with it, and which will definitely have an impact on interest rates and inflation across the Eurozone.  That wouldn't help either. 

Ignoring the discussion about poverty, the elderly, and 'social protection' as a whole, which was mainly a side point in this discussion and a whole other discussion in itself, I have made the case that growth is good, but growth costs money, and money adds to debt.  When our debt is already at a critical level, adding to it brings us oh so much closer to default.  We may want growth, we may think it's better at fixing recession (which it is) but growth can only be used counter-cyclically when debt levels are low and can be balanced by reduced expenditure when the economy is in a growth state.  Carrying this horrendous debt burden has placed us squarely outside the Keynesian method; Ireland is running very close to the margins for failure, and the only way to return to our pre 2001 state is to cut debt through reduced expenditure. If there was another way, I'd support it, but there isn't.  The results of rejecting a Treaty, even if it is somewhat flawed, will have significant ramifications for the nation in the markets that will effectively undermine all investor confidence in FDI here and further in Irish financial instruments like equity shares and sovereign bonds.  In order to grow,we desperately need FDI, we need a stable banking sector, and we need low debt levels; if it creates mass hardship to get there and means we have to support an unpopular Treaty to get there, then so be it. I see no other way. ",0,1337541611,null,0,false,0,c4q9ra2,t3_ts1tw,t1_c4q9ra2,t1_c4ppz10,null,1428963945,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

You're trying to disavow your previous posts, and it's really embarrassing for you.  If you have an opinion/position, either stick to it or admit you were wrong.

&gt;I simply said they did not simply ""declare"" their way out of trouble. 

Did I ever imply that was possible?  It is not the position of any economists that defaulting on debt or allowing banks to fail wouldn't cause *any* damage to the economy, just that it would cause *less damage* than bailing them out and increasing debt further.

Yes, I was in Reykjavík for a day, last September while I was waiting for a connecting flight to Denmark.

&gt;It's far more complex than you seem to think.

Look, I just pointed out that Iceland's extra borrowing was minimal compared to their GDP, and that their improvement was mainly a function of *not* bailing out their banks.  This is a very good real-world example of the free market in action.  When a government doesn't intervene much, it allows for deflation, which is ultimately healthy for the economy because prices more-accurately reflect actual demand.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"You already covered the negative sides of the suggestion so I won't add to them. But I will question the motivation to suggest this. If the motivation is purely theoretical, based on the philosophy that capital and capitalism are bad, then that is not good enough reason to change the system. Now if there are real motivations such as young people, young families, old people, or less fortunate can't afford housing, or owning housing is too hard, then those are problems that can be dealt by the system.

For example here in Finland... 

* In every municipality there is public housing available that one can afford even when living with only benefits. People and families are prioritized based on their needs, most needy are served first. Even in the most popular places like the capital area, people are quickly server, those in hurry need to settle for housing in more distant corners while those who can wait will be able to get a housing from more popular places.
* For people who want more security and freedom while not wanting to buy their own house, there are Housing with Right to House. In short you invest approx. 15-20% of money of the building costs to the housing company, with that you get lifetime right to live there, of course you have to pay for maintenance and capital costs, making the form of housing approx 25-35% cheaper than renting. If you decide to leave the housing company, the company will pay back your investment.
* In case you want to own your housing, but you don't have rich parents to back you up, there is government backed loan program for people between 18-30. In the program, a person has to make deposits for at least 2 years time, after the saving up, persons deposits will cover 10% of the value of the housing, 70% will be covered by the housing itself, and the state will cover the rest. So if you can save 10000e, the bank will give you 90000 loan.

In my honest opinion, it is better to have capitalistic system allowing people to be driven by the profit motivation, but in the same time make accommodations for people who can't afford or who are just starting their own independent life's.",0,1337551152,null,0,false,0,c4qbfch,t3_tttvh,t1_c4qbfch,t1_c4q7te7,null,1428964729,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

That's an inflation rate above 2% this entire time, and it almost reached 6% directly after the crisis.  Can you imagine what the inflation rate would be if the ECB started pumping new Euros into the greek economy at the pace of a tidal wave?

Default and leave the Euro.

Default with assistance from the ECB and stay in the Euro.

Just as I have no problem with debt reduction.  How we disagree,  I feel, is on how we achieve them.

&gt; signing it will only mean that Ireland is forced to reduce it's debt level by 3% a year

Signing it means that Ireland has to reduce its debt level from 120% or so of GDP to 60% over the next 20 years.  If you hack away at the expenditure in a way which also reduces GDP, then you're going to have to reduce a lot more than 3% of the debt, because as the GDP falls, the same euro value of debt will represent a higher percentage of GDP.  That's why growth is critical.  Not only because it's good for people and society generally, but because it impacts on the numbers.

&gt; a 1% STRUCTURAL deficit fiscally

The use of capitals here doesn't avoid the fact that you haven't responded to my challenge in a previous comment to strictly define this term.  I've gone elsewhere for a definition without success too.  Colm McCarthy has said:

&gt; ""The measurement of structural deficits is more or less impossible and the inclusion of an un-measurable concept in an international treaty is a reckless piece of drafting.""  

Karl Whelan has said:

&gt; ""the legal invocation of the concept of a structural deficit is unfortunate. This is a theoretical concept and empirical measures of it can differ widely depending on how the analysis is done. Legally binding rules that rely on impossible-to-measure quantities are likely to run into trouble sooner or later.""  


&gt; The Treaty, on the other hand, has come to signify the position that Ireland will take toward 'austerity' and budgetary expenditure.

A rather silly thing to have happened.  

&gt; if we reject the Treaty, we reject the 12 other member states who have already ratified it

Who has already ratified this?  I am only aware of Greece having lodged their ratification instrument.  Could you enlighten me further?

&gt; Second, I meant we would be joining the likes of Greece who is hardly the role model we should support.

As Greece is the only country, as far as I know, to have ratified this, it is ratification which would mean we are ""joining the likes of Greece"".  

&gt; Outside of Europe, Mr. Hollande's election wasn't greeted with joy, but rather apprehension. 

It was greeted with a variety of different reactions from a variety of different perspectives.  Apprehension was certainly the view of one of these perspectives, but as Frances has a veto on the establishment of the ESM, I guess we all have to work with them.  In any case, since M Hollande won, suddenly everyone is all about the Growth.

&gt; We agree that debt and growth do not happen simultaneously

It's a challenge, but it has to be done.  Abolishing the Seanad in the morning, would save an admittedly modest €300 million per year, but would have no negative impact on growth.  Similarly investment in modernising the infrastructure of the civil service so that less paper needs to move around would ultimately lead to a saving in running costs. 

&gt; The fact that Ireland only spends 22% of its GDP on social protection is by itself unimportant.

Unimportant to you, perhaps.  But it shows that we have precious little to cut there, and that savage cutting on its own will cause undue hardship to those who are least protected from the recession, and has little room to dramatically impact on GDP.  However, I take comfort from this that you do seem to have read something I have written.

&gt; I have not concerned myself chiefly with how I feel about the problem

Might this be because you are not a recipient of much social protection, and it could all be abolished without impacting on you personally?  Myself, I recognise that I don't just live in an economy, I live in a society, and I care to see that the society is adequately protected.

&gt; One cannot spend money and save it at the same time, unless I am missing something major here

Perhaps you are.  Governments, corporations and individuals must all simultaneously save and spend, all the time.  It's not a new concept.

&gt; The results of rejecting a Treaty, even if it is somewhat flawed, will have significant ramifications for the nation in the markets that will effectively undermine all investor confidence in FDI here and further in Irish financial instruments like equity shares and sovereign bonds.

This is your prediction, and you are entitled to it.  My belief is that committing ourselves to a wrongheaded slash and burn policy will deplete the infrastructure of our society, promote a brain drain, and ruin our competitiveness in the long term.  This permanent solution to a temporary problem can do massive long term damage.

It is a very complex picture and abortion is definitely not a positive thing by itself. It's just that there are many other factors that are worse and make it a reasonable decision in many cases. But if 100% of pregnancies are aborted there is something very wrong in the rest of the picture.  
  
For one thing it shouldn't be necessary. People should prefer other forms of contraception that are safer, more cost-effective and also protect against diseases. There are risks to abortion and it isn't reasonable to take it so lightly.  
  
And it is in fact termination of a potential life, no matter where you set the bar for where life starts. If someone thinks it is perfectly OK to go around starting new lives willy-nilly and then aborting them without a second thought, I really don't think they have thought it through properly, and I don't think that is OK. No religious agenda here, I just think life if precious and there are many open questions and things we don't understand about it, as well as many psychological aspects regarding parenthood, offspring and genes and it really is a mistake to see abortion as a simple solution.  
  
I'm not arguing against abortion here, I think abortion is reasonable and defendable in many situations, maybe especially in these countries that are often poor, extremely socially conservative and have low education levels and lacking social safety nets for single mothers. 
I think that this explains to a large degree why the percentage is so high, but I think it is a symptom of other problems and that the governments in these countries should work to lower them.

Most of the time, the work that gets to these media outlets is second-hand at best. 

I would encourage you to read his/her posts in our conversation. I let his/her rhetoric postings in every instance go, but when I watched the Youtube post, it was too much. Wikipedia, Youtube, Dailymail.co.uk, economy.com, these are the sources for information I was given to refute. Now I think I was very fair in assessing the ideas first. I could have said something like 'Please come back when you have read something credible by someone who has some idea of what they are talking about,' and it would have been a valid point. The ideas I was given to read as evidence were nothing more than rhetoric outlets. They are the kind of things people go around quoting but have no idea why they do and no real understanding of what they are actually saying. This is precisely the reason that few people here actually understand the issue we are discussing... These kinds of messages make the real issues so much harder to understand, and the decisions that voters make so much more complicated.

Frankly, I didn't need a petty swipe to demolish that argument'; I only wanted to say that that particular way of providing evidence wasn't acceptable.  This might not be an 'academic forum', but my peers in this forum are people who have dedicated time to studying things and to listening to experts in their fields, and they deserve the respect for doing it and likewise the accountability for their words.

**EU summit to raise pressure on Merkel**

*By Peter Spiegel in Brussels and Patrick Jenkins in London*


European leaders are drawing up a series of crisis-fighting proposals to raise at an informal EU summit this week that have in the past been rejected by Germany putting further pressure on Chancellor Angela Merkel.


The proposals, which could include empowering the eurozone’s €500bn rescue fund to directly recapitalise faltering European banks and commonly backed eurozone bonds, have been backed by some leaders in the past but forced off the agenda by the German chancellor’s objections.


The discussions have gained urgency amid signs of stress in parts of the banking system that some analysts have likened to a slow motion bank run.


Their resurrection is the latest sign François Hollande’s election in France has shifted the terms of the eurozone crisis debate, giving advocates of such measures – who include José Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, and Mario Monti, Italian prime minister – a powerful new ally. 


It also reflects the growing belief among some leaders that instability in Greece necessitates revisiting the crisis procedures to ensure they are sufficient to deal with a Greek eurozone exit.


“If we let Greece go down, the ring fence for the rest of the eurozone will [have to] be much more solid,” said one senior politician involved in the deliberations.


European officials cautioned that Wednesday’s summit would focus on proposals to spur growth rather than crisis-response measures. But one senior European official said the Greek crisis has spurred “parallel” discussions, particularly on ways to shore up Europe’s banking sector. 


Senior officials said those talks have focused on using the €500bn European Stability Mechanism to directly inject capital into banks, discussions that have intensified in the run-up to the summit. Mr Hollande also said after the weekend’s Group of Eight summit he had backing from other leaders to raise the eurozone bond issue. 


Another controversial measure back on the public agenda is unlimited purchases of Spanish and Italian sovereign bonds by the European Central Bank, a proposal opposed by Germany but advocated by the Polish finance minister in an article published in Monday’s Financial Times. 


“Europe must escape the devil’s alternative of not being able to keep Greece in the euro, and not being able to risk it leaving,” writes Jacek Rostowski. “We need the ECB’s readiness to intervene massively in sovereign bond markets only in the case of a country actually leaving the euro.”


Officials said while eurozone bonds remain controversial, the bank bailout scheme appeared to be gaining traction, even though Germany has blocked it in the past. “We lost the battle last time around and I’m not sure there’s been enough movement in the member states, particularly one member state,” said one advocate involved in negotiations.


Currently, EU rescue funds intended for banks can only be lent to national governments, who then recapitalise weak banks based in their country. Such lending adds to a nation’s sovereign debt, however, essentially solving one problem but creating another.


The issue has gained new urgency in Spain, facing renewed concerns over the cost of supporting its banks, given the extent of the property crash there. Some analysts estimate the sector needs €50bn-€100bn of fresh capital to allow banks to recognise latent losses on property loans, money that may be hard to raise without EU aid.",0,1337585277,null,0,false,0,c4qh6zy,t3_tx7rn,t1_c4qh6zy,t3_tx7rn,null,1428967560,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,we_who_love_freedom,null,null,"Since you don't think I read every line you write, I will respond by lines. 

First I will accept your fractions argument. It's 1/20th of difference per year between 60% and 120%, over 20 years, which I averaged to be 3% based on the readings I was presented. If the counting is being done by solid numbers and not fractions of GDP, then that is slightly different to how I was shown in the calculations.  

I have read these authors to whom you are referring. I get that the idea of a structural deficit is theoretical and poorly understood, despite the fact that it is being used in plain language in a legal document.  I would state that IMHO the Treaty is here trying to provide some leeway for the varying economic positions of the states, but that is my opinion. 

Is it really that important that we can't define 'structural deficit' explicitly, when considering the Treaty? I don't thinks so. Such extreme debt levels place the EU nations we have been discussing outside the Keynesian window.  A best-case scenario for them is a balanced budget; at least then the debt problem is not getting worse.  Does a hazy term mean that we should abandon the idea that a mandated expenditure reduction to revenue level is necessary? 

&gt; Who has already ratified this? I am only aware of Greece having lodged their ratification instrument. Could you enlighten me further?

All EU member-states except the Czech Republic and the UK have signed the Treaty. Signatories also have the added responsibility of internally ratifying the agreement and codifying it into their body of law in order to prevent nominal agreement and practical disagreement. Now I was wrong when I said that 12 nations had ratified it. Actually, nearly everybody has agreed to it, and most are in the process of making it internally legal, through their own parliamentary mechanisms.  I meant to imply that most of Europe has agreed to the measure, and further, that our challenge of it is the exception rather than the rule. Whether you count signature or formal codification as indicative of acceptance is in most cases the same; everyone else signed it with the intent of ratifying it.

&gt; It's a challenge, but it has to be done...

I never said anything about cost-saving measures in either the public or private sectors as being unacceptable. I would support these ideas under almost all conditions. I do not think that redundancy for the sake of job creation or sustainment is a good thing to maintain even in a growth phase. If the modifications you pointed out occurred, however, it still wouldn't change the fact that we have extreme debt.  Changing our organisational model to one that is more efficient is a good thing, but would only provide a small fraction of what is needed to fix the problem.  You and I have both stated that we can't expect to grow under reduced spending, and the government's plan to grow economically while deleveraging isn't feasible.  Either we can do this, or we can't. If we think the government's figures are overly optimistic, and we think that it is working at cross-purposes, then we don't support simultaneous growth and reduction.  The inference that I got from that line was that you were trying to support the position of a growth/reduction confluence that you had disagreed with earlier, in an attempt to force an argument to work.  

&gt; Unimportant to you, perhaps. But it shows that we have precious little to cut there, and that savage cutting on its own will cause undue hardship to those who are least protected from the recession, and has little room to dramatically impact on GDP. However, I take comfort from this that you do seem to have read something I have written.

I'm offended that you don't think I read every line you write. That's really unnecessary as an insult.  I read the Eurostat figures myself. 

Now I stand by what I said about the statistics.  Using GDP as a reference point for evaluating expenditure when there are handy percentages from the budget available is trivial.  If Ireland spends 50% of its GDP in total, and of that 22% is in social protection, it is exactly the same thing to say that of its budget, 40% to 50% is spent there. This is 22/50, or 40-50/100, respectively. While Ireland might look like it spends less than everyone else, on the 10 dimension social protection category, it spends the same as the rest of Europe and is therefore unremarkable. Only on defence and recreation/culture is it remarkable in that it spends the least. Since you like Karl Whelan, I will give you one of his colleagues who has made the chart as reference to the Eurostat: 

http://www.ronanlyons.com/2010/11/02/where-should-ireland-cut-its-public-spending-thoughts-for-budget-2011-ii/

Bear in mind that stating that spending 22% of GDP or 44% of revenue leaves little room for cutting is not logically true. As the largest proportion of expenditure, actually, it has the most room for reduction. I think the argument that you are trying to make is that all of what is being spent in this sector is essential and therefore cannot afford to be sacrificed.  This is also not a true statement.  If the Government had to choose between maintaining Live Register payments and continuing to function, as it could, it would re-evaluate the standards for social welfare eligibility. This is not to say that I don't support unemployment benefits, but to say that when the continued existence of a government is threatened, the dole is not nearly as important.  

&gt; Might this be because you are not a recipient of much social protection, and it could all be abolished without impacting on you personally? Myself, I recognise that I don't just live in an economy, I live in a society, and I care to see that the society is adequately protected.

I go to school full time, and work nearly full time as well. I am proud to say I am not on social welfare, and even prouder to say that I don't expect anyone other than myself to take care of me. Do I think that social welfare is unnecessary? No, I don't. Is my opinion based on my own experience? Somewhat I'm sure. Do I expect other people in society to contribute as much to their own success as I contribute to mine? Absolutely. Do I expect people to refuse to quit on themselves and their predicament because it seems hard? I sure do. I try to live as if there is no safety net, and this is precisely why I am successful. Do I believe that 'society' idea to which you were referring? A resounding No. I not a collectivist and proud of it. 
&gt; Governments, corporations and individuals must all simultaneously save and spend, all the time. It's not a new concept.

Actually they don't. With regard to corporations, their earnings go as dividends, retained profits for capital, or reinvestments in operations. Governments spend money as expenditure, or save it as surplus; people either save the money they earn or spend it. Nobody can spend the same euro on something and save it at the same time. We are running a deficit that seems insurmountable, and it makes zero sense to borrow money only to save it.  This isn't semantics; if we are going to spend more than we take in tax revenue, it will be used for a purpose.

&gt; This is your prediction, and you are entitled to it. My belief is that committing ourselves to a wrongheaded slash and burn policy will deplete the infrastructure of our society, promote a brain drain, and ruin our competitiveness in the long term. This permanent solution to a temporary problem can do massive long term damage.

I don't know how in the world you can categorise a debt of 120% of GDP that requires 25% of tax revenue to service as 'temporary'.  By EU standards it will take 20 years to return us to stability.  By less restrictive standards it will take even longer, especially if the whole growth we are counting on to provide surplus money with which to pay off the debt comes through borrowing.  I have no doubt that things will get worse before they get better. Those who stick it out will see an Ireland with a stable financial outlook gradually re-emerge, and a lot of those who left will return when times are better.

Lastly, since you deemed it necessary to point out that I didn't outright refute your claim that I couldn't define 'structural deficit', I will point out that you have in no way refuted the main points of my argument, but have rather glossed over them. I claimed that rejecting austerity will mean increased spending, which will mean a larger budget deficit achieved by increased borrowing from some source; I claimed that our debt level is at a critical amount, and that growth will not mathematically outperform debt obligation as it accumulates. I have seen no model of how the growth will occur through spending that is in any way sustainable, despite mentioning it numerous times. To me this has indicated that emotion rather than logic is running the show; 'austerity' hurts and the suffering of the people makes you reject it without real rational consideration.  You are saying that you want a new car and will figure out how to pay for it after you buy it because it makes you feel better, despite the fact that it will probably ruin you in the long run. If all our problems are temporary, then sure, there are loads of things we could do now. How about we instead take a more old-fashioned, more self-reliant, and more rational/logical approach and ask if we can afford each consideration we weigh, rather than just bowing to public pressure and following the crowd.

true,BakersDozen,null,null,"&gt; I get that the idea of a structural deficit is theoretical and poorly understood, despite the fact that it is being used in plain language in a legal document. I would state that IMHO the Treaty is here trying to provide some leeway for the varying economic positions of the states, but that is my opinion.

Just because the words ""structural"" and ""deficit"" are words easily defined, it doesn't mean that the economic concept of ""structural deficit"" is, and I thank you for your acknowledgement of that lack of definition.  Doesn't it seem deliberately obfuscatory to put a precise target against a vague definition?  We simply have no idea what this means.

&gt; All EU member-states except the Czech Republic and the UK have signed the Treaty. Signatories also have the added responsibility of internally ratifying the agreement and codifying it into their body of law in order to prevent nominal agreement and practical disagreement. Now I was wrong when I said that 12 nations had ratified it. 

Thank you.  

&gt; I'm offended that you don't think I read every line you write. 

No offence was intended, I just felt that as you hadn't responded to so many of my points that maybe you hadn't read them.  You are engaging on this one, so that's good.

&gt; If the Government had to choose between maintaining Live Register payments and continuing to function, as it could, it would re-evaluate the standards for social welfare eligibility.

...as it has done repeatedly over the years.  

&gt; Do I expect other people in society to contribute as much to their own success as I contribute to mine? Absolutely. 

Do you believe that everyone has equal opportunity to do so?  Do you believe that children who struggle in primary education, whether through Special Needs, access to other supports, or economic disadvantage deserve additional help to ensure that they are not given up on while still in single digits of age?  Can you propose how they could be given this help while ""saving money"" by cutting back on special needs assistance, resource hours, and closing rural schools?  I use the quotes here because I don't happen to believe that condemning someone to a lack of equal employability for their adult lives for the sake of the cost of a little extra facility in their years in primary education, actually saves the state any money as they will be more likely to claim on state services for their lives.

&gt; Do I believe that 'society' idea to which you were referring? A resounding No. I not a collectivist and proud of it.

I would love to know what notion of ""society"" you are referring to when you can reject it so thoroughly.  I'm somewhat baffled.

&gt; Actually they don't. With regard to corporations, their earnings go as dividends, retained profits for capital, or reinvestments in operations. Governments spend money as expenditure, or save it as surplus; people either save the money they earn or spend it. Nobody can spend the same euro on something and save it at the same time. 

I see you have to reduce the argument to the absurd to disagree with me on this one.  Of course you can't simultaneously save and spend the same euro.  However we all (individual, corporate or state) need to determine where to save and where to spend.  We have to do both, with different euros, if that helps clarify.  In my case, I can shop around to find the cheapest petrol.  I could stop buying petrol altogether and save a lot more than the cent or two difference per litre I can find.  However, then I wouldn't be able to go to work - as a rural dweller, I am unserved by public transport.  So, I save where I can, and invest where I need to.  We all do this. 

Incidentally, I note that while one cannot save and spend the same euro, it is possible to gamble the same euro multiple times through highly leveraged cross-collateral finance deals. 

&gt; I don't know how in the world you can categorise a debt of 120% of GDP that requires 25% of tax revenue to service as 'temporary'.

Are you arguing the opposite?  Is it your assertion that it will be with us forever?

&gt;  I claimed that rejecting austerity will mean increased spending, which will mean a larger budget deficit achieved by increased borrowing from some source

And I responded, twice if I recall correctly, that we will have to seek more funds in any case.  The government is telling us that with a ""Yes"" vote we will get this from the market, rather than from the ESM.  Other commentators disagree and say that we will need a second ""bailout"" in any case.  Whichever side of this you believe, the money has to come from someplace, even in the event of a ""Yes"" vote.  Of course we have to cut back on our debt.  But that doesn't mean we stop borrowing overnight, and savage the welfare payments of the poorer off to try to make up the difference.

&gt; I claimed that our debt level is at a critical amount, and that growth will not mathematically outperform debt obligation as it accumulates.

Again, you seem to be arguing with the straw man you erected.  I have never said that we can grow out of this without saving.

&gt; 'austerity' hurts and the suffering of the people makes you reject it without real rational consideration. 

Austerity hurts and as per the government's own estimates it isn't working.  Can you point to where austerity in isolation has?  I raised the question of taxation before, you declined to engage with it.  I make a reasonable salary, although it doesn't go far on a family of four.  I would happily pay a  percent or two more in income tax as a contribution to the balance, provided a third tax band was introduced for those who earn much more than I do saw them contribute more.  This would be far more equitable than water and bin charges, or messing with VAT rates.  So far, from you, I have only seen the mantra of spend less, rather than raising more.  And spending less hits the poor.  Just out of interest, as a self made man, do you know how much the state contributed to the cost of your post-primary education?

&gt; You are saying that you want a new car and will figure out how to pay for it after you buy it because it makes you feel better, despite the fact that it will probably ruin you in the long run.

As it happens, I drive a generic japanese car, over a decade old, and paid for a long time ago.  When the government tried to pay me to take on the debt of replacing it, with their scrappage schemes, I resisted because it made no sense to me or to the country.  Your analogy is rather trite, as was your previous one of enjoying the view as I drove off a cliff.  Having been on the receiving end of two of your analogies which widely missed the point, I'll send one your way.  You can reduce the running costs of your car by removing the engine, but it won't get you very far.

&gt; How about we instead take a more old-fashioned, more self-reliant, and more rational/logical approach and ask if we can afford each consideration we weigh

We should certainly revisit much of how we manage the national finances.  I've already mentioned a couple of places where I feel we could save money.  One pretty much overnight, and one as the result of some strategic investment.  Here are some others.  Reduce the tax relief ceiling for pension contributions.  Why should someone wealthy enough to be able to salt away 25% of their salary in their 40's not pay some tax on that amount?  It would be great if we could afford it, but right now, we can't.  Of course I understand the deferred benefit in this argument, the more people who provide for their retirement, the less the state has to cough up.  However, it overly skews the system in favour of those who can afford to save.

The top 400 earners in this country, pay an effective tax rate of 20%.  They work on the same PAYE scale as you or I, but are in a position to avail of far more tax avoidance schemes, than those on a sustenance wage, who end up paying a higher percentage of their income on tax.  A situation compounded by the introduction of blunt instruments where more and more domestic charges are levied regardless of income.

We need to focus government on reducing spending where possible, generating more revenue from those best able to pay it, properly regulating the financial markets so that we are not held hostage again, and developing policies and structures to foster growth.  The treaty as it stands doesn't take this holistic view, commits us to implementing more austerity, which is already known to be failing.

The German comes up with it, the Italian invents it, the Englishman takes it into practice, the American buys the patent, the Japanese copies it, the Spanish doesn't want it, the Norwegian talks himself out of it - and the French makes everybody a member of the Reaumur Academy. The Germans writes a Bibliography of the events.

The European States show their actual character under the same cover of Religion, Telephone, Cinema, Press and Police: Golf, Bull Fighting, medal ribbons, Skat, Theater gossip, and Peppers. You can bargain about Religion and the other abstract things - with those national possessions the states have rigidly strict individuality.

There's a dead man on the street. The German lays him on the right side, the Englishman checks if he took his own life, the French stamps him on the stomach - and Mussolini makes it very clear he didn't do it.

The false States of Europe: England, France, Spain, Italy, Hungary, Prussia, Estonia, Lithuania, Romania, Bavaria. The boarders are there. The real states of Europe: Unemployed, Workingman, Employer, and Beneficiary of other's work. The boarders blur.

In Europe you are once a citizen and 22 times foreigner. For the wise it's 23 times.

This has a grain of truth.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katharevousa

But all national identities of the 19th century are ideological constructs. And most languages of Europe went through a phase of renewal in the 19th c. And that's because most european languages were plebeian languages, spoken by the peasantry, yet all of a sudden, one needed a national standard that was equipped to be used in all spheres of life, includding the more cultured and technical ones.

For example, Romanian wenth through a phase of re-Latinization, abandoning Slavic words in favour of French or Italian borrowings. That was because „Latinness” is central to Romanian nationalism.

Also, keep in mind that the Turks of Anatolia aren't all invaders from Central Asia. Most are descendants of pre-Turkic peoples who got Turkified (linguistically and culturally). Just like modern Hungarians are mostly the local population that got „Magyarified”. So even if Greeks got Turkified and then re-Greekified, it wouldn't matter.

Another interesting example is the 19th century Finnish nationalism, which was spearheaded by Swedish-speaking Finns, the so called Fennomans. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fennoman",0,1337598304,null,0,false,0,c4qi8l3,t3_twrb6,t1_c4qi8l3,t1_c4qi0fg,null,1435715547,8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,8

If collectivisation meant to centralise everything and that's what Stalin did, then this isn't really what leftists want, is it? 

The point of the left-right divide is to take the highly dimensional structure of political ideology and project it to a single dimension while retaining some useful properties. Otherwise, it would not be convenient to use it. 

Your reference to Hitler should answer your own question. If central planning is the defining characteristic of projecting political ideologies to the left-right spectrum, then, you would have to place both Hitler and Stalin on the same position. That would make the left-right divide inconvenient; you already suggested yourself that it makes sense that they should fall into different positions. 

That's why I keep asking the question of how you define the left-right divide. For me, it makes more sense to say that the Left means that power should be shared while the Right means that power should be given to those who deserve it. If you define it that way, then both Stalin and Hitler are right-wing because they were dictators, socialist policies that help establish worker's control are left-wing, capitalism and economic libertarianism are right-wing because they preach that economic power justifies itself and so on.

*Originally nomads (hunters and fishers), all the Finnic people except the Lapps and Ostyaks have long yielded to the influence of civilization, and now everywhere lead settled lives as herdsmen, agriculturists, traders, &amp;c. Physically the Finns (here to be distinguished from the Swedish-speaking population, who retain their Scandinavian qualities) are a strong, hardy race, of low stature, with almost round head, low forehead, flat features, prominent cheek bones, eyes mostly grey and oblique (inclining inwards), short and flat nose, protruding mouth, thick lips, neck very full and strong, so that the occiput seems flat and almost in a straight line with the nape; beard weak and sparse, hair no doubt originally black, but, owing to mixture with other races, now brown, red and even fair; complexion also somewhat brown. The Finns are morally upright, hospitable, faithful and submissive, with a keen sense of personal freedom and independence, but also somewhat stolid, revengeful and indolent. Many of these physical and moral characteristics they have in common with the so-called "" Mongolian "" race, to which they are no doubt ethnically, if not also linguistically, related.*

[Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVh2s5cKFyY)

**Translation:**   
Lately it's getting modern again,  
I can't hear it anymore,  
always the same old cheese (meant as shit)  
blood and soil, tribe and race,  
be of pure blood is again worth something  
are we dogs or am I a horse?  
But before I tell you some more,  
let me introduce myself:

My grand-grandfather was a mountainfarmer,  
a lederhosen-jodler, german as possible  
his wife a maid from some little town  
between Balaton and Budapest  
the other one a vagabond, that's what he was called  
a handsome one, so my grand-grandmother didn't wait for long  
now I stand infront of the mirror and look at myself,  
and I say: Look at that, it's really true

I wear a headscarf, a kippah, a styrian hat,  
where I can hear the wild rivier, you can't get me away,  
I love muttonmeat and Kaiserschmarn,  
and without Tamburizza-music I would be lost,  
I'm from India, I'm from Palestine,  
from the Wachau, the Ramsau, even from Africa and China,  
From here and there, from there and here,  
In my blood, look at that, a party is going on  

(Chorus) I'm the fine mixture, special blend,  
people like me, you know how we're called?  
I'm the wild blend, the brown ones are getting pale,  (brown ones means Nazis)  
I'm from Austria  

If I hear karinthian songs, what I feel then,  
the slovenian inside me begins to sing,  
And if the world brings me to laughter or tears,  
I have to hear the tuba right then,  
I'm a bohemian jew, a gypsie from Vienna,  
I'm a senner, a janitor, a muezzin,   
I'm a young Roman, an old Croatian,  
If I wouldn't exist it would be a pity.

I'm the fine mixture, special blend...

One is named Drago, he's blond with blue eyes,  
the other one is called Gert and looks the same,  
just like you would imagine a Drago,  
Some are Ayryan and some are crazy,  
some are both,  
everything is mixed up anyway,  
here in our Austria.

I'm the fine mixture, special blend...

Very much agreed Mr. Clegg.

The fundamental problem is none of the nations of eurozone feel sufficient familial sentiment with [all] of the other nations of eurozone.
Thus common governance will not be considered legitimate for it cannot
be [both] representative of [and] accountable too [all] the peoples of
europe. This problem is compounded by the nature of the EU
where national governments deliberately fail to seek the consent of
their people when they divest the authority to govern, lent temporarily
to them by the people, to an unrelated and unresponsive third party. It ceases to be government by the people, for the people.
The further you go down this road the greater the civil unrest will
result, and if your ambition is to add to the sum of wellbeing and
welfare of the peoples of europe then no sane man can support
ever-closer-union. If we were talking about ever-closer-union
between germany, the benelux nations, austria, and perhaps finland then
this would not be a problem.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;The people of europe have to decide whether they are [a] single people with [a] shared destiny.
  
I agree completely.  And the problem is that there is no open dialogue about what the EU is *supposed* to be.  I think there needs to be a common set of specific ideals and goals that the EU is aimed towards achieving.  Do we want it to be little more than a free market?  Do we want it to lead towards a genuine unified European superstate?  And if it's somewhere in between, do we want there to be specific issues that are dealt with by the EU law and different issues dealt with by national law?  Whatever the answers to those questions, I think we need to make those decisions if the continued existence and enlargement of the EU is to have real legitimacy.  
  
With regard to the euro, if there was a set of specific goals, then countries could choose to join or leave the euro, and the eurozone could choose to accept or reject them, based on how well those goals could be met.  And people in countries holding referenda would know what they were really voting for.  
  
As things stand, I can't help but feel the purpose of the EU is to serve the interests of those running the organisation.  I just don't have any reason to believe that the EU genuinely exists to benefit the people of Europe.  Letting us decide what *we* want the EU to be would change that completely.  
  
I also really agree with Clegg when he says this:  
  
&gt;And the second big issue is this: You cannot have a single currency without fiscal transfers. Those fiscal transfers can take lots of different forms: They can be the sharing of debt, maybe in the form of euro bonds. They can be transfers from one government to another. You have to have something which creates a fiscal accompaniment to monetary union.  
  
Especially the part about eurozone bonds.  I think that if a single currency is going to be successful, it needs a certain amount of true financial integration.  The current situation is that the euro is little different from the ERM, in that it's just a group of nation states with little common financial ground other than the value of their currencies.  But it has none of the shared responsiblity that a common currency needs if it's going to work in the long run.",0,1337605423,null,0,1337605847,0,c4qiwnn,t3_txatf,t1_c4qiwnn,t1_c4qil7p,null,1428968379,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

There is no essential difference between taxation and extortion: if you don't pay, you are shot with a gun.

No education system is perfect.  Our education system as it stands does an excellent job of minimising the barriers to access that poverty can create, at least with regard to learning. The homogeneity of our system is far better than other places like the US where their outcomes are more stratified. The closing of rural facilities in both the hospital and school sectors is happening to consolidate operations where the most good can be done for the most people, not to directly harm rural communities. 

&gt; I would love to know what notion of ""society"" you are referring to 

I don't believe in collective rights, e.g. a society, that exist beyond individual rights of it's own accord. I do not feel any responsibility as a 'society member' to bear the burden for the rest, despite the model being touted as the correct way to govern by progressive moralists.

&gt; I see you have to reduce the argument to the absurd to disagree with me on this one. Of course you can't simultaneously save and spend the same euro.

It wasn't absurd.  We are meaning different things when we say 'save'. I do not mean to indicate cost-saving measures that save money by making things more efficient, which we will have to do in any case.  I mean that as long as high debt levels are driving an imperative to maintain a deficit, which is worsened by additional borrowing on top of that which is occurring to operate the nation, we will not be able to achieve any savings or 'surplus'.  I wanted to drive home the point that we have left the Keynesian system behind and the question is how much we borrow, not if we borrow it, and also that our political activities with regard to the EU have the potential to threaten our ability to borrow or at least the interest rates at which we do it. That seems fair doesn't it?

&gt; as a rural dweller, I am unserved by public transport. 

Bus Eireann and the trains often operate at a loss to provide some, albeit basic, transport for ruralites.  They do an excellent job and realistically cannot be asked to do more. If costs of goods and services make it difficult to maintain life out in the country, then move to the city to avail of available services. Don't expect the whole system to cater to you because you live outside it. 

&gt; Are you arguing the opposite? Is it your assertion that it will be with us forever?

It will be around until it's paid off, which will take a very long time by current estimates, dependent upon what system is used.  Or it will be around until some method to liquidate it is applied, whether that be through a haircut for Irish bondholders, reducing the loan service rate, or plain writing off them off. In any case, all plans we make must be first structured around what we plan to do about it, with the priority that we will be unable to function normally without assistance until a more manageable level is achieved. Likewise we must at least minimise and strive to eliminate borrowing from any source to fund the government.  Borrowing money to pay down debt is absurd; what portions are paid off are replaced by the money borrowed to do it. 

&gt; Whichever side of this you believe, the money has to come from someplace, even in the event of a ""Yes"" vote. Of course we have to cut back on our debt. But that doesn't mean we stop borrowing overnight, and savage the welfare payments of the poorer off to try to make up the difference.

Actually, that is exactly what I mean. This is a desperate situation. We must do whatever has to be done, no matter how hard it is. We cut back to only essential services, which means of social welfare, the only payments we make are disability ones.  It won't be that we don't want to pay unemployment assistance, it is that we can't afford it and other services are more important. I am sure you have visions of widespread catastrophe because the government stopped social benefits, of people dying everywhere and starving. It wouldn't happen. You'd be surprised how motivated and innovative people get when they are left to take care of themselves. 

On a side note, I do not expect this to actually happen.  Our leaders are cowards who are more afraid of political consequences than economic ones.  The social protest over this would be severe, and nobody in office would last long enough to enact it, despite the fact that it would save us.  Whoever is in charge would quickly be replaced by whomever says what the people want to hear, whether it has basis in reality or not. 

Likewise, I really think you should consider the consequences that rejecting the Treaty will have on our borrowing. It seems a bit naive to think that we will still have access to the same amounts of capital at the same interest rates no matter what choice we make. You seem to think my opinion that rejecting the treaty and austerity will be disastrous in the markets is pure speculation and as a result inconsequential.  You seem resigned to the idea that the market won't care what we do and that the EU won't have any problem handing us ESM funds despite flouting the conditions they set for it.  If that's the case, then good luck.  At least I considered how things would play out. 

&gt; Austerity hurts and as per the government's own estimates it isn't working. Can you point to where austerity in isolation has? I raised the question of taxation before, you declined to engage with it.

First, on 'austerity'.  I take issue with what is meant by 'austerity' in the first place. We got some fiscal consequences to taking the bailout funds, e.g. incrementally reduced spending. The 'austerity' idea implies that we are having to do this hard cutting of the budget for some period of time in order to rectify a situation, at which point we can resume our previous practise.  In our case, 'austerity' does not mean this.  If the troika hadn't mandated some budget restriction, we would continue the pattern of worsened deficits that has continued since 2003 (although it didn't get really bad until 2007).  There is no 'resume spending' place in which to return; our 'austerity' is actually an admission that we are chronically overspending, and our 'hardship' time is actually just the process of returning to normalcy.  It is not a severe sentence being imposed as punishment. 

On taxes, I don't support any person being asked to pay a higher share than any other person, regardless of income.  In the name of equality, I won't sacrifice one person to save another, or burden a successful person with more share of responsibility than I place on a poor person, they are both equal in my eyes and have a right to their earnings just the same. I do not support raising taxes on an already overtaxed people.  The tax amounts we pay here, from capital gains, to VAT, to motor, to Stamp Duty, to household, to water, etc are insane. I don't expect to raise revenue through increased taxation while at the same time reducing social expenditure; I am trying to facilitate people taking care of themselves, not hamper it, and the government not giving people less money and asking them for more of it.  Let the people keep as much of their money as they can.  Later when things are stable again, I would move to slash these taxes and minimise the government as much as i can. 

&gt; Just out of interest, as a self made man, do you know how much the state contributed to the cost of your post-primary education?

As it happens I did my undergrad in the States, and paid for it in cash by working, and I am doing my post-grad in Galway, and had to pay for it in full. There were no grants for me. 

&gt; As it happens, I drive a generic japanese car, over a decade old, and paid for a long time ago.

It was only an analogy.  I don't care about what car you drive. 

&gt; The top 400 earners in this country, pay an effective tax rate of 20%. They work on the same PAYE scale as you or I, but are in a position to avail of far more tax avoidance schemes.

Schemes devised to help encourage them to invest the money back into the market.  It's incentive, much like our low corporate tax rate of 12% that has attracted so much FDI.  We provide tax incentive for big earners to expand their operations because it boosts the economy.  Making corporations pay more will only hurt production, which rather than consumption, is the driving force sustaining us economically.  We need all the producers and jobs we can get, and a little tax break for providing jobs and prosperity is a good thing. 

&gt; We need to focus government on reducing spending where possible, generating more revenue from those best able to pay it, properly regulating the financial markets so that we are not held hostage again, and developing policies and structures to foster growth. 

All of those things will hurt our position, except of course reducing government spending.  More financial regulation means more government interference in the markets which makes them more inefficient and less competitive. Changing our monitoring policies to more effective ones will help, but we need the government to get out of the market if we want to see it grow.  Less government requires less taxes, and puts more money into people's pockets, and lowers the price of goods and services.  Education, healthcare, defence, and infrastructure, I would government maintain, but the rest have to go.  Likewise, the market will grow if we stop impeding it. 

&gt; The treaty as it stands doesn't take this holistic view, commits us to implementing more austerity, which is already known to be failing.

The Treaty isn't about these things, it's about liability.

You've stated that R is the interest rate of the debt, but you've actually plugged in the percentage of GDP used to service the debt, 6.8%. This is the first place you've lost me.  Shouldn't the interest rate be a percentage of the amount borrowed, rather than of GDP?  But I'll assume you know more than I do about this, so 6.8% it is.

Government estimates that growth will be of the order of 1.9% this year.  I'm not sure who believes that, but let's leave it in.

-pD = R - G

-pD = 6.8 - 1.9

-pD = 4.9

pD = -4.9

All correct so far?  Our breakeven point is a move from 120% deficit to 4.9% surplus?  meaning that we've got to make budgetary savings worth 124.9% of our GDP of €130bn, that's a whopping €162 billion of savings to be found?

According to Budget 2012, our total current expenditure for the year is expected to be somewhere in the region of €50-55 billion.  So to cut our way out of this, we would need to stop all government current spending - hospitals, schools, police, the lot... for 2-3 years to satisfy the equation.

Does that look right?

true,we_who_love_freedom,null,null,"An R value is normally used to in economics to refer to an interest rate.  But in this particular regard, we are relating it to GDP, as a real rate of debt, in order to keep the evaluation on equal terms. Both the R and G values are relative to GDP, as percentages. Interest rates do set the servicing amount, which is non-voted expenditure in the budgets, but since we are talking about GDP growth, we are more interested in what percentage of GDP that payment amount represents. In Ireland's case, it was when I last calculated it, a payment of 25% revenue, and 6,8% of GDP.  I could ascertain what the actual interest rate was for the debt, but I didn't need it for a calculation I was asked to perform, so I didn't do it. I want to say the interest payment for 2011 was 11bn or so, or 44bn in revenue, so if you take that payment and measure it against what was borrowed, you could work out the interest rate is.  

Anyway, you are exactly right. At 1.9% growth, a 4.9% surplus is needed  to balance a 6.8% GDP debt obligation.  You did, however, make a mistake when looking at the 120%.  It's 120% debt to GDP, not to deficit.  Last year Ireland ran a 10% deficit, and in 2012, if it can achieve it's target, is expected to run an 8.6% deficit.  So, using your calculation, in order for us to maintain equilibrium and remain debt-neutral, we need to move from an 8.6% deficit to a 4.9% surplus, which of expenditure is a 13.5% shift.  Since your are saying our total expenditure for next year is going to be 55bn, we will have to reduce the overall budget expenditure by 7.4bn.  Of our 55bn, 4.73 was borrowed, so what we needed to do was not borrow the 4.73bn, AND cut an additional 2.67bn from the budget.  Now bear in mind that this position would only keep us debt neutral. We wouldn't be adding to, or taking away from, our debt obligation. We just wouldn't be making it worse. 

Although your math analysis was wrong, I think your conclusion was sound.  We obviously must begin to pay the debt off if we ever want to be able to grow without borrowing extensively to fund it, and more importantly if we ever hope to break the cycle of perpetual debt in which we are beginning to participate.  If we continue to run large deficits, as a function of a rejection of 'austerity', then our growth targets become impossible to reach, and we continue to pile on debt.  At a 10 percent deficit, we have to grow 16.8% to counter it. We'd never make it. As you showed, the only remote way we have of escaping the cycle is through our budgetary stance. We will not have nearly as much control over the growth level of the economy as we will on expenditure; its the only parameter that we set.

The question is whether it can be done.  Can we cut enough out of the budget from any sources, to create a surplus? One problem is that when we cut expenditure, we also cut tax revenue, which we will have to overcome.  Another issue is from where it can be cut. My opinion is that things like infrastructure (hospitals, roads, schools, etc) are already canabalised as much as they can be.  We can stop new projects from starting, and keep conditions as they are now, but I think to take more from them will leave people without access to life-sustaining services. IMHO, place the money has to come from will have to be social welfare.  Categorically, it's our biggest expense, and to me stands the least chance of collapsing the economy. I would advocate re-evaluating the eligibility criteria to separate those who cannot work from disability, to those who aren't working due to loss of job.  I would grant benefits to those in former category, and deny it to those in the latter. 

Bear in mind that these are desperate measures we are talking about here and there is no good solution. It would create social chaos and widespread dissent to do this, if it can indeed be done.  I know that reducing the benefit to most of a 400k person dole number would have significant and severe economic effects, but it's a matter of which effect is worse.  However, there is a substantial possibility that we simply cannot cut enough. That the 7.4bn we don't spend will collapse the economy by taking too much money from too many hands.  If this is the case, then the debt is unsustainable, and we are perhaps better simply defaulting and leaving the Euro altogether. I know that if we reject austerity and do not maintain a gradual budgetary step-down, we will eventually default, although it may be a slow agonizing process either because we couldn't make the interest payment, or because we triggered economic collapse trying to get the money together to pay it.

We have however a few problems with that. Employees are taxed directly from their wages, so they pay them fully. Many other people instead have various ways to dodge them, by avoiding invoices, paying under the table and generally reporting much lower incomes than what's true, taking advantage of many loopholes and 'special' laws that always seem to be there when needed.

This means that richer people actually end up paying less taxes AND get to use the services intended for poorer people, like school taxes exemptions or low-rent housing. For example you get a tax discount on a property as long as it is your main residence. People with several properties can just state that each family member has a different main residence, so they get all the discounts, then they rent them out off the books, paying no taxes on the rent.

This kind of stuff was, at least until now, seen as normal: everybody does it, so you're a sucker if you don't. I'll give you a discount on the rent, you keep quiet and everybody's happy, and we both have cheated the state who wants to rob us.

But the one time I got fucked with healthcare was the year I chose the cheapest plan, and then I ended up sick for a month, and had to get very expensive antibiotics and 2 CT's, but my total out of pocket came out to be 1500 bucks, although the total bill to the insurance company was around 6,000 dollars.  Now, 1500 bucks is not that bad when you're getting paid very well.

Student loans, those are a bitch if you  don't apply for scholarships or maybe for those who decided to go to elite schools, or maybe you decided to get a degree in philosophy.Many ways to get around loans.

We're talking about Greek politicians, not persons &lt;1/2 wink&gt;. The former politicians I should say, and I don't think Papandreou was the worst of the lot -- I think the former governments were much more responsible for Greece's runaway deficit spending. It's true there are families and businesses being destroyed around the northern shores of the Mediterranean -- but it ain't a witch-hunt.

It's lack of trust in elected officials.

I for one welcome the courage Noonan and our own Gaspar displayed by pointing out that it's time for Greek politicians to change their behaviour. Since you question Noonan's speech as unworthy of an ""European Union"", allow me to retort! I have no doubt that Dutch and other northern, quite productive, EU countries will help and stand beside ailing countries -- if those countries show themselves to be serious about dragging themselves out of economic death-traps. I am unable to say that I expect Syriza to have such seriousness. To put it bluntly, I wouldn't trust Syriza with my money to organize a low-key bachelor party, much less an ailing economy's recovery.

Back to the Dutch, who (along the rest of those productive northern EU countries) ponied up a lot of money for infrastructure projects here in Portugal. Why should they feel comfortable ponying up even more money for us? I think they would, if we admit we have a serious deficit-spending problem and if we make an honest serious effort to find the causes and fix those issues.

Now with regard to corporate finance, firms structure their capital in two broad ways, debt and equity, both of which have strengths and weaknesses.  Equity, either through stock or commercial paper, has no risk of bankruptcy, but is expensive since investors require a premium return on investment to compensate them for carrying all the risk, which they do when they invest. Debt, on the other hand, is cheaper--interest rates set on loans or debentures is less than the equity premium demanded by investors; however, debt creates vulnerability. The more debt a firm carries, or the extent that is what is called 'leveraged', the more likely it is that any disruption to earnings can result in default on the obligations and bankruptcy.  Financers like to use debt where they can, and most businesses run with something like a 70/30 or 60/40 debt to equity ratio.  From what you said, your father's firm is what we call 'highly leveraged' or highly composed of debt.  It's a dangerous position, and the continued existence of the firm will derive from the salience of the earnings generated by how the loan funds are used. Choice of investment is critical. 

Now, with regard to nations, things are different. In the EU, the Lisbon Treaty bans a practise called monetary financing, or the direct loaning of money from the ECB to governments.  So, none of the EU states can take direct loans to erase their debt, or take loans to invest in things, or even accept free money to liquidate things.  The bailouts that happened came as a result of a fund entity created for this specific purpose. What governments do, instead, is issue bonds, which are similar to loans, in that they are a contractual obligation to repay an investment at a certain time with a certain amount of interest.  The problem being faced by struggling EU nations at the moment is the fact that when these bonds are traded in the market, fears of instability and default, are reducing their worth in some cases to practically nothing, and new bonds being introduced into the market won't get interest from buyers unless they come with a high interest rate as compensation for the risks involved. This, overall, is making financing the government more difficult at the moment.

I guess your standards of excellence in this regard differ from those of [Bernardos](http://www.barnardos.ie/what-we-do/campaign-and-lobby/educational-disadvantage.html), then.  I could pick other sources too, but why drown this in links on the first point.

&gt; If costs of goods and services make it difficult to maintain life out in the country, then move to the city to avail of available services.

I was about to outline the reasons for where I live, but was quickly writing a brief recent biography, suffice it to say that as one ages, one takes on additional responsibilities, which may dictate where one lives, and how mobile one can be - possibly not something which is easily reflected in a spreadsheet model.  In any case, I am happy to drive my car, and we are off on a tangent.

&gt; Actually, that is exactly what I mean. This is a desperate situation. We must do whatever has to be done, no matter how hard it is. We cut back to only essential services, which means of social welfare, the only payments we make are disability ones. It won't be that we don't want to pay unemployment assistance, it is that we can't afford it and other services are more important. I am sure you have visions of widespread catastrophe because the government stopped social benefits, of people dying everywhere and starving. It wouldn't happen. You'd be surprised how motivated and innovative people get when they are left to take care of themselves.

It is hard to know just how serious to take this point.  Desperate situations and desperate measures, but always at the expense of the least well off.  In closing the deficit gap, you focus exclusively on the outgoings side of the equation without a hint of increasing taxes.  And somehow it will all be fine because 400,000 unemployed people and their families will suddenly find a means to support themselves.  The same presumably goes for all other vulnerable groups. 

Why not instead look at reducing the tax breaks on pension payments?  What about extending USC to all income?   What about a higher rate of tax for those on top incomes?  I'm sure they'll survive even more easily than someone with no income at all.

&gt; The social protest over this would be severe, and nobody in office would last long enough to enact it, despite the fact that it would save us

That ""us"" is a small group which excludes the vulnerable, presumably?

&gt; You seem resigned to the idea that the market won't care what we do and that the EU won't have any problem handing us ESM funds despite flouting the conditions they set for it. If that's the case, then good luck. At least I considered how things would play out.

You only considered one side of how things would play out.  Incidentally, the Tanaiste let it slip that the Troika would fund us in the event of a No vote.

&gt; First, on 'austerity'. I take issue with what is meant by 'austerity' in the first place.

Fine, let's save you the bother of using the quotes from here on by looking up a definition or two:

From [The New Statesman](http://www.newstatesman.com/ideas/2010/09/austerity-word-red-conference)

&gt; austerity is an economic policy: deficit-cutting, slashed spending and the mysterious evaporation of benefits. 

[Oxford online dictionary](http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/austerity?q=austerity):

&gt; difficult economic conditions created by government measures to reduce public expenditure:

Looks like a good match for the policy you espouse, and the sort of measures that the Treaty would seek to impose, with no mention of an end date.  I think you no longer need the quotation marks.

&gt; On taxes, I don't support any person being asked to pay a higher share than any other person, regardless of income. In the name of equality, I won't sacrifice one person to save another

And yet that's exactly what you are proposing. You seek to sacrifice the vulnerable so as to protect the well off from having to dig a little deeper.  And you expect that that's how we all get out of this.  That's the model I would regard as insane.  Could I ask if you intend to take this vision into actual real world politics?  If so, what party?  I would watch with interest.

&gt; Schemes devised to help encourage them to invest the money back into the market.

Allowing an unemployed person a few euro a week to buy food puts the money into the market too.  In fact it boosts the local economy.  Buying a Mercedes sends a large portion of the money back to Germany.

&gt; More financial regulation means more government interference in the markets which makes them more inefficient and less competitive. 

Yes please!  ""light touch regulation"" as practiced in the US and much of Europe in the past decade hasn't exactly worked to our benefit.

&gt; The Treaty isn't about these things,

It most certainly is about imposing a policy of austerity.  Albeit not quite in as stark terms as you would seem to advocate.

Yep, thanks for correcting.  Should never rush this stuff.

&gt; we will have to reduce the overall budget expenditure by 7.4bn

OK let's have a look.   That's about a third of the Social Protection budget of 20.5 bn; or a little over half the health budget of 13.6 bn; or almost all of the education budget of 8.6bn.  No other budget area would be big enough to cover this amount on its own.  In fact, adding all other departmental maxima together would come to just over 9 bn - so you'd be looking at pretty much eliminating Agriculture, Food &amp; the Marine, Defence, Transport, Tourism &amp; Sport, Foreign Affairs &amp; Trade... everything.

For you, I guess it's all about that social protection?  Hit the freeloaders and their families?  Just for god's sake don't ask those with the money to pay any more.

No, Britain wants the disadvantages of the EU to end for everyone, not to singularly not have to put up with them.

&gt;What Britain really wants, is to go back to the EC days (as long as the net money flow remains positive, of course, courtesy of Thatcher), but fails to see that something like the EC is not sustainable in the current world theater without further integration.

Again, no. The British public are overwhelmingly in favour of foreign aid and funding infrastructure projects in less developer countries- what they're against is pissing money away for no appreciable gain. There are too many horror stories about crap projects in Eastern Europe being used to line the pockets of corrupt officials.

&gt;Britain defines itself by being anti-EU. Britain wants the City to become Europe's main economic and fiscal center

Again, no. The City **already** is the economic and fiscal centre of Europe. Britain wants it to stay that way, ie not pushing all the bankers to other countries because the EU wants to impose populist taxation policies for no rational benefit. Why charge more tax to bankers when we could charge more to plumbers? If you want to argue for Pigovian taxations to fund bailout policies, go for it- but Britain is already insisting on **higher**  reserve ratios for British banks than Europe, not the reverse.

&gt;, but has no manufacturing base left to speak of nor takes part in Europe's fiscal unity.

This is such crap. Britain's manufacturing sector is second in the EU. That's right- higher than France's, Italy's, Spain's.

http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/ind_man_out-industry-manufacturing-output

Its just not what the British tabloids like to spout- they like to go on about the decline of manufacturing because old conservatives harp back to the good old days. Manufacturing has reduced in pretty much every Western country. Britain's manufacturing sector could be better, but its hardly small. 

&gt;Britain's EU contributions these days come down to shooting down any proposal that so much as hints to not being fully advantageous to them, and walking away from summit meetings after their ""nein"". Britain is not being constructive, but harkens back to days long past.

Financial transaction taxation makes no sense to Britain- particularly when we *already* tax financial transactions more than most countries in the form of stamp duty. The problem is Britain wants to see policies for growth, not arbitrary taxation policies which 80% will come from the UK and then being sent to Brussels. In what way is that right? It'd be like us suggesting a tax on vineyards and then seeing what the French would say.

Gallipoli (Turkey) was a profoundly moving experience - partly because it is in some ways the place where, through dreadful sacrifice, New Zealand stood up and became a nation in its own right.

Passchendaele was also very moving - again because New Zealanders were *slaughtered* there, used up by the British Generals, trying to win the ""high ground"".

Thiepval was heartbreaking.

Watching and listening to the last post being played at the Menin Gate at Ypres (as it has every night since WW1) was so moving I had tears rolling down my face. I didn't know what to expect. Since it happens every night, I thought there might be one or two spectators, and no one else paying much attention. But the reverence, the stillness, the silence, the respect, was all so profound.

Beaumont Hamel was incredible because there is still evidence there of the trenches and craters there.

Also seeing one of the enormous craters made by the underground mines - astounding.

These all relate to WW1. The thing that struck me about WW2, was entering big German cities (like say, Munich) for the first time in my life. I was excited to be seeing medieval chapels &amp; cathedrals and architecture. Instead I was driving through non-descript kind of 50's post-war slab-sided concrete architecture. Only then, I began to realise the level of devastation from WW2.

For the same reason I love Regensburg, where I spent a little time. The ""aldstadt"" (sp?) was not bombed in WW2. It was incredible.

Imperative stops

- Moena: charming town; park [here](http://g.co/maps/kzy9a) and check out the ""downtown"" area along the river; if you can, walk up to the church and towards the small village of Sorte: you will be rewarded with a great [view](http://g.co/maps/53cwt) of the whole Moena (how I miss this place, I used to go here almost every summer with my family on vacation!)

- the Pordoi Pass: after driving from Canazei to here, you will have to take a break for sure (so many hairpin turns!); I highly recommend the [cable car](http://tangoitalia.com/turismo/trentino/sass_pordoi.html): the view from the top of the Sass Pordoi is [amazing](http://www.flickr.com/photos/anzanov/6801183611/in/photostream/lightbox/)

If you have more time, other stops in order of interest:

- Lago di Carezza / Karersee: just google-image it! To get here, when driving northbound through Vigo di Fassa, you should leave the main route, and turn westward: see [here](http://g.co/maps/c5tng)

- Lago Fedaia: it's an artificial lake by the Marmolada (the highest mountain in the Dolomiti); when in Canazei, leave the main route: see [here](http://g.co/maps/94y6z); basically, you will be at the bottom of the Marmolada glacier

- Cavalese: the main town in the Val di Fiemme

The banks are foreclosing houses, the house goes to a bidder (generally the bank) that pays less than the loan that is being foreclosed and the people have  to pay the difference after the state bailed out that same bank with our taxes.

And may I remind you that the southern countries are made up of peaceful people, and we are getting fed up. The last time the Germans became fed up with the banking system and with austerity we had a world war.

These new politics are very dangerous because they are not lying to anyone, they are not hiding their ideals, and they are getting a vote. Beware Europe!

You can do away with the austerity tomorrow if you want. Simply stop borrowing money and you can do exactly what you want. What you cannot do is expect is for the citizens of other nations (and its not just Germany) to hand you over their money no string attached. Money is not free. Somebody somewhere has to work for them. And when you give it to somebody else, those people will have to do without. Either you make the case to the German factory worker that he should work harder and longer, that he shall expect poorer health care and schools, or you don’t have a case.

You can make that case to me, a North European tax-payer (and I bet I’m already heavier taxed than the vast majority of citizens of the Mediterranean countries), but only if I see that you have started and diligently continue to pursue a program of economic reforms which within a reasonable timeframe will make you competitive and self-sustaining. Now I recognise that Spain, Greece, and Italy already have done many things which will benefit them over the longer period, but more remains to be done. And you can be absolutely and 100% sure, that when I hear foolish things like the French president babble about 60 year pension age, then you are not making the case.

&gt; Right now Europe has to decide what it wants to be. It either federalizes (at least economically) and we all win, or it dies as it has been dying for the last 2-3years.

If it is closer economic integration and a transfer union you want, then you have to remember that Portugal/Spain/Italy are far from the poorest countries in the EU, or even the euro-zone. The Mediterranean countries would have to make wider savings and cuts in order to send billions of euros to the more impoverished Eastern European and Baltic nations. These our European friends are already tremendously unfairly treated in the farm subsidy program (where they receive a much smaller subsidy than the Western and Southern European nations). I hardly think it would be fair that they should be given second rank status also in a transfer union, and I don’t see how transferring funds out of Portugal/Spain/Italy would improve their situation. In fact those less well off countries were already called upon to finance the existing aid packages to the richer Mediterranean countries.

true,maladeus,null,null,"&gt;You can do away with the austerity tomorrow if you want. Simply stop borrowing money and you can do exactly what you want.

What if we stop paying? What if Greece, Portugal, Spain and Italy jump of the boat tomorrow? Where does this leave the Euro, Europe and everyone else? Remember we are in this together.

&gt;What you cannot do is expect is for the citizens of other nations (and its not just Germany) to hand you over their money no string attached. Money is not free.

Nobody argues that money should rain from Germany or whoever lends with no strings attached. It is good to have strings attached, Portugal, Greece and Spain are not innocent and we needed the restructuring. Nevertheless the Portuguese the Greeks and the Spanish people are innocent  and your strings attached are hanging them. Strings attached? Yes! The problem is that until now austerity as produce little to no results with great collateral damage to Europe. It is time to rethink the formula. 

&gt;A North European tax-payer (and I bet I’m already heavier taxed than the vast majority of citizens of the Mediterranean countries).

I doubt that. 25-35% of my income goes directly to the state, 40-50% of my father's income goes to the state and I bet we earn less than we would in your country. Then again we are lucky to have a job. 

&gt;If it is closer economic integration and a transfer union you want, then you have to remember that Portugal/Spain/Italy are far from the poorest countries in the EU, or even the euro-zone.

It is not closer economic integration I want. What I want is integration. I want it to stop being north VS south, us VS them, Germany against Europe. We are in this together. We might be poor but we are your market and we are friends, or we were before this crisis started. 


You must concede, How many years have been since Greece fell? Are we any better? Austerity is not providing the expected results, end of story. Staying on this path will bring nothing good for any of us.  

I don't know what to do, I don't have answers, what I know is that austerity per se doesn't work. What I know is it is time to rethink Europe. Together!

However, once you pay the toll at the Lisert exit, the last stretch of highway to Trieste is Tutor-free (and also toll-free). Also, be very careful when driving through mountain villages along the Trento-Cortina route: there are frequent speed cameras there, and the speed limit is usually just 50 kph. Outside of highways and town centers there are fewer controls, although you might be randomly stopped by the carabinieri (more frequently encountered in that mountain area than the police) at a checkpoint carrying submachine guns. There's no need to worry, though, if they just stopped for a random check they'll want to see your license and registration, and you'll be back on route in a few minutes. If they stop you because you were violating some traffic rule, they will issue a fine that you cannot pay on the spot; go to a post office instead and pay it there.

&gt;..No private lender will give these people money.

Spain and Italy are getting all of their money from private lenders. Of those mentioned, you're speaking only of Greece and Portugal. 

&gt;they don't want to spend less so that you can live on the money you do make. You can't fill a wallet by screaming at it. 

A country is not a household, it doesn't get its money by working for a salary - rather, it gets it through taxation, that is to say, as a percentage of the money made in the entire economy. So how much it has, and how much it can and should spend is a function of the state of the entire economy. And given the size of the budget in any country in comparison to the total economy, how and how much it spends it determines that state to a fair extent.

So the money it makes is not a relatively fixed quantity the budget needs to fit in, but another variable, alongside of the size of the budget, with which to balance the fiscal position.

&gt;I'm not a big fan of austerity during a recession. Austerity is good during boom times so that when the wind turns you can spend lavishly and get back on track, but guess what, not an option now.

Yes, but how much of it is a good option now given the situation is pretty much the only question remaining - since the cuts are depressing the GDP further, the debt and deficit levels become even worse, its an honest conundrum what speed of cuts and what structure of taxes and spending will get a country back on track, and which will just collapse the economic system, and hence the political scene, etc.

&gt;Current military” includes Dept. of Defense ($653 billion), the military portion from other departments ($150 billion)

OK, so far so reasonably sounding.. though there are already some weasel words here regarding how they define ""the military portion from other departments"". Scroll all the way to the bottom, and they explain, ""Not everyone agrees what constitutes a military function. For example, [we] include the 70% of Homeland Security (which includes the Coast Guard), and half of NASA in military spending, while other groups do not.""

&gt;and an additional $162 billion to supplement the Budget’s misleading and vast underestimate of only $38 billion for the “war on terror.” 

Where did they just pull that number from? 

&gt;“Past military” represents veterans’ benefits plus 80% of the interest on the debt.*

Note the asterisk, explained in small font further down below:

&gt;*Analysts differ on how much of the debt stems from the military; other groups estimate 50% to 60%. We use 80% because we believe if there had been no military spending most (if not all) of the national debt would have been eliminated. For further explanation, please see box at bottom of page.

And no, the box all the way at the bottom of the page doesn't actually provide any substantation of how they arrive at that 80% number either. It just says, ""How much of the debt is considered “military” varies from group. As mentioned above, WRL uses 80% whereas FCNL uses 48%.""

So, basically, they arrive at a 50% military share in the budget by adding budget items like NASA, which still sounds plausible enough, then adding a seemingly arbitrary and unsubstantiated $162 billion, and then on top of that adding a whopping 80% of the debt interest payment - yes, somehow military spending accounts for 80% of the debt even though it only amounts to 50% of the running budget, even by the organization's own opaque calculations - a number that's far higher than the ones other groups use, and for which they also don't seem to provide any substantation.

Many modern economies borrows from the future to pay its current citizens. Germans don't do that, they pay state pensions out of current taxes, not some giant social security fund. Private pensions are owned by many germans, but they know that those are not guaranteed as much as state pensions.

If germans can solve their birth rate problem, then their idea of not borrowing from the future generations will put their future generations on top economically.

Basically, a giant nations wealth can't be stored in giant banks, because no such things exists. Pension funds of all giant nations are able to saddle the future generations with giant debts.

I am saying that the specific conversation the two of you were having, where you dismissed criticism of corporate tax cuts as something that must just be coming from Che-t-shirt-wearing, Ipod-hipster wannabe communist youths, amounted to a straw man argument.

&gt;This is because companies tend to use fewer of their resources for consumption (as opposed to investments) than people. 

But it is exactly the lack of consumption spending that is adding to the economic freeze right now. If people see their purchasing power cut sharply, they a) obviously, have less money to spend, and b) are less likely to spend even that which they do still have, preferring to stash it away safely in a time of crisis. And if people are not spending, companies are not making any money, and corporate tax cuts do little to offset that.

One can argue that yes, but increased consumer spending might just lead to EU citizens spending money on Chinese- or US-produced items that benefit overseas economies more than the European one.

Don't ask me, you wouldn't like the answer.

First and foremost - educate the public. The typical for our region small corruption (like having to pay €5 to a police man just to let you through) should be the first thing to go. Make active good public campaigns against that. Everybody knows about it, why pretend it's not there??? It all starts in the schools. Make schools strict and righteous institutions again. Make it a central issue, give children praise for honesty. Educate children on the negative effects of how small corruption that they think doesn't hurt anyone ACTUALLY erodes the system. 

Second, make it easier for ordinary people to be honest and clean. Less punishment for smaller crimes - death penalty for corrupted officials and mob thugs (yes I'm fucking serious). Let me give you this situation as an example. A driver gets minimum wage and isn't happy about it. After the day is finished he has some petrol left in the car, he pumps it and resells it (stealing) to be able to buy nice shoes for his kids. His superior knows he does this but doesn't fire him because this way he could never ask for a raise, and they get away with slave-driving wages. Let's make it easier for the small man do break this cycle of corruption. Give him the opportunity to come clean and actually fire his boss for manipulation.

Third, bring the old school back: blitz incarceration, resettlement camps and executions. Again, I'm fucking serious as hell. Go Joseph Stalin on that motherfucking human waste and I guarantee you in 2 years time it's going to be clean as it was before ""democracy"" kicked in. We need to get rid of the cockroaches first, then we become "" ""civilized"" ""democratic"" ""state"" of ""rights"" "".

Add up the taxes you contribute to the national health care system in a country like Sweden to the out-of-pocket costs you pay in addition, and compare it to what Americans are paying for private health insurance and treatment, and you still get a pretty good bang for your buck.

Massive public works such as roads, trains and power stations can employ millions of people who would otherwise be out of a job, many of whom would turn to crime, become a burden on the social security system and contribute nothing in taxes. The value of the infrastructure goes without saying. Of course this requires a lot more borrowing but by doing this the country can go through the crisis without as much pain and when the crisis passes it can start paying back the debt.

With austerity the aim is to reduce consumption in order to reduce the budget deficit, but it can have the negative effect of shutting down large segments of the economy and causing mass unemployment etc which then negatively effects the aims of the government to balance the budget because suddenly there is a shortage of tax income and increase in social security payments as well as unrest. This is exactly what the UK government is experiencing right now.

Ultimately, the government has to find a balance and decide whether to cut spending or boost jobs, or a combination. 

Then there's the fact that most EU countries are already massively in debt... adding more is not ideal.

I think I kind of get where you're coming from. Every sentient being should be able to freely utilize their individual potential, and every form of government is a force that is limiting their freedom and therefore their ability to contribute to the greater good. Is that correct?

And I would fully agree if people weren't so fucking stupid in one way or another. Just as an example, you can be a brilliant musician/scientist/engineer/superhero and still be a racist asshole, which leads other people to think that the two are connected causally. Idiocy like this happened, still happens and will happen for a very, very long time. As long as we cannot make rational decisions easily without fighting our emotions, it is vital to severly limit the power of any individual. Sadly, distributing decisions between many individuals is the only way to discard emotions. (And even that doesn't work very well sometimes.)

The worse part was that the way the pipeline for the paperwork is set-up, and how inefficient the office was, they wouldn't be able to meet their own deadlines repeatedly! This meant more work for them and for me, which in turn slowed things down even more. It was very frustrating to know how the paperwork wouldn't get done on time due to their lack of resources, and how this would lead (over and over) to me having to miss work again, fight for a spot to ask for an extension or another, wasting my time, and their time.

true,almodozo,null,null,"Germany has come out on top in the crisis by running a huge trade surplus - basically, people across much of the rest of Europe are buying German products and thus liquifying the German economy. 

Other than the question whether that makes them ""the European hero of the crisis"", that model is not an option for many other countries. 

For one, Germany has a very strong manufacturing base; ironically, one which was created, historically, through the kind of strong public support, and on the basis of excellent infrastructure, which austerity dogma bans other countries from emulating now. Moreover, it's a logical impossibility for everyone to run a huge trade surplus. 

Basically, the economic unification and eurozone have allowed Germany, at the EU's center, with its prior advantages of being one of the best resourced economies, to further strengthen its position. The less competitive peripheral economies, in the new, open European economic zone, saw their position deteriorate and became more dependent on German imports.

I don't blame the Germans: they did what they do best, shipping superior products to wanting markets. But they didn't do badly out of the economic unification and lifting of trade and investment barriers at all, while the peripheral economies in southern Europe became even less self-sufficient and ended up running huge debts. 

The latter should have responded more nimbly and more urgently to those changing circumstances with economic reforms (if not necessarily the IMF-endorsed type). But there's also something ironic about Germany having pushed strongly for a European model (an open EU-wide trade- and investment zone without corresponding strengthened EU-wide governance) which benefited the German economy greatly but served to escalate inequalities within the EU, and now complaining that they don't want to subsidize the less-well resourced economies that naturally did worse under those conditions.

This is just flat-out not true. Overwhelmingly the biggest export market for Germany, the most important export driven European economy, is the EU. The other countries inside the European Union are good for easily over 50% of German exports. The role of Latin America or China as export markets is marginal in comparison. Hell, Germany is *importing* more from China than exporting to it.

EDIT: The MIT's Observatory of Economic Complexity has awesome visualizations [for each country](http://atlas.media.mit.edu/country/deu/) that make these proportions immediately clear. The profile for Germany [looks like this](http://www.diigo.com/item/image/krqo/p390). 

EDIT2: For example, Italy, all by itself, is already a bigger export market for Germany than China. Italy, by itself, is also already a bigger export market than all of Latin-America combined. Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece together constitute a bigger export market for Germany than all of Eastern Asia combined. If it wasn't for that dastardly irresponsible spending by those profligate South-Europeans, the German economy would do a lot less well too...

true,WalkerEU,CYPR,Cyprus,"Long term resident of Cyprus here and fluent in the Greek language.

The mainstream media and politicians are treating the crisis as a wake-up call to fix deficit spending and restore confidence in the economy.

The feelings of the people are very hard to explain because of the amount of variations that exist. A few common ones are:

- Excellent, now the government will have no choice but to fix the problems and stop adding more debt -- and hopefully the greedy public worker unions get gutted.
- OMFG, it's time to distance ourselves from Greece
- Lesser educated people who don't understand that Cyprus is one of the biggest creditors of Greece (at least as a % of GDP) and has the most to lose from any kind of debt forgiveness etc sometimes ask why they don't just forgive the debts, but once you explain that to them they start to say ""omfg, then they should pay"" (you wouldn't consider this to be assholic if you understood that the exposure is higher than the country's GDP when you account for both public and private loans -- if you forgave that money, Cyprus would end up needing a bailout instead)
- Overall a clear majority of the people of Cyprus do not want the PEOPLE of Greece to suffer, and there are several programmes for sending food and aid over there.
- It's becoming more and more apparent in the media that something as extreme as Greece leaving the eurozone will cause really serious problems in Cyprus and will make it require a bailout from the EU as the banks of Cyprus have lent more money than the entire GDP of the country to greek citizens and businesses.
- Long-term optimism exists due to the oil &amp; gas projects started in collaboration with Israel.

Overall, the economy of Cyprus follows a very similar pattern to the economy of The Netherlands in percentages and is generally considered quite a strong economy with a history of a stable currency that easily allowed it to join the eurozone without messing with the numbers. Right now everyone is waiting to see what the hell happens in Greece politically as the short-term catastrophe that would come from a ""grexit"" is a big concern to everyone -- this has lead to the island's various political parties to unite and pass bills to help the confidence rise in the economy -- something which is quite unusual. The vibe I'm getting from various people on the island with money is that no matter what happens, they will never again let themselves be so exposed to one country -- they like Greece and the greek people, but this kind of situation will not be allowed to occur ever again.

Longer term, like for example 5 years from now, Cyprus should start receiving revenue from oil and gas which makes it a good place for people to invest for the longer term -- and this has already started happening.

tl;dr: Cyprus is being slowed down by the current economic crisis and risks requiring a bailout if Greece defaults and/or exits the eurozone. Overall the economy has a good long term outlook, and the political parties are uniting to cut un-necessary spending in order to increase the confidence in the country's finances, in order to avoid an EU bailout that comes with conditions.

Ninja Add: Overall in simple terms, the majority of the people would likely prefer for some kind of growth projects and/or eurobonds -- they just want a solution to whatever is causing the slowdown, but do not necessarily understand on average what exactly needs to be done.

It's just a very screwed up position to be in. On one hand, Cyprus is one of Greece's best friends -- and on the other hand, if Greece doesn't pay them or pays them with less money we're gonna have HUGE problems in the short-term.

Also the opinion of letting greece exit the eurozone so they can 'free themselves' or whatever the hell they were preaching was popular with perhaps up to 25% of the population a couple of months ago, but most of them went quiet after hearing that it would destroy Cyprus overnight :P

I really think you're overlooking a significant amount of tax-paid services that government provides. If taxes were to disappear completely, we would be left with private industries trying to do what the government does. Instead of being beholden to the public (assuming it's an uncorrupted government), it's beholden to shareholders and the profit motive, creating an incentive to misinform, price-gouge, price-fix, and reduce quality as much as possible. This occurs regardless of the moral fixations or corruptivity of whoever is in charge, because a business is very different from a government in terms of goals.

Sure, governments don't always spend taxes wisely, they don't always have a perfectly-gauged tax rate, and they don't always act in the interest of all the people they govern.

As time went on an elite group of aristocracy kept the dream alive, secretly going to meetings and making sure everything went according to plan. A peaceful and prosperous union, who could say no? And they'd even make it about trade. With capitalism on the rise, few nations declined, and somehow, even in a democratic society the politicians in control always wanted the 4th reich to live. Most citizens voted for center parties. *Or so they thought.*

In 2009 the entire finanicial collapse was dreamt out by Angela Merkel who organized the collapse of the global banking system to institute her take over. She, more than anyone wanted to have all of europe. The idea of putting all the key government buildings in brussels was a ruse, and the germans had been keen to keep strasbourg as an alternative, which they would eventually annex as soon as the federal government took control. 

Slowly from the year 2030 onwards the Germans insitituted a policy of 2 children for all german citizens. Those who chose not to have more kids would not receive the same social benefits. Then with key people implemented in the federal government they slowly shifted policy to a german centric view. The demographic collapse of Germany was wrong, by 2050 the population reached 120 million, much more than even its closest rival. Berlin became the financial center of the European Union, and over the next 50 years German became the official language of all European States, even though most spoke English. Crazy, I know.

The ""Beamtentum"" is a system initially introduced by the prussian regime (1871 - 1918). It's a special class of civil servants / public officers that can't go strike and must be loyal to the state but who also have lots of privileges. They basically have a for-life employment guarantee, receive awesome salary (with a fixed promotion ladder based on length of tenure), have not to pay into pension funds or unemployment insurance.

But that's what people do! People love to complain about their healthcare. Despite a fair extent of national pride in the NHS, Britons still love complaining about how crap British hospitals are, how long you have to wait for treatment .. and Americans love to complain about how expensive their doctors are and how extortionist the health insurance companies, and the Dutch complain about waiting times and how you're better off going to Belgium or Germany for an operation -- and you don't want to know what Hungarians say about their doctors and hospitals. It's just human nature. 

Just like the media, everywhere, love a good scandal to report on.  

&gt;Countries in which there is medical and dental ""tourism"" - for example newer EU countries like Romania and Bulgaria, but also Poland and the Czech Republic, have a very high quality of dental care, very cheap. Seriously. Look into it if you want, you'll be blown away.

I live in Hungary nowadays ... yes, private dental care here is very cheap for German and Austrian tourists who come in here by busloads to fix their teeth. There's dental clinics everywhere targeting such ""dental tourists,"" especially in Budapest and close to the Austrian border. But there's a duh-factor there: of course it's cheap here for an Austrian coming in. Wages here, including those for doctors, are very low compared to those there. Most Hungarians can't afford those clinics ... The average wage here I believe is something like 500 Euro a month. I've gone to a private clinic for my teeth myself, and even though I earn twice what the average Hungarian gets, it's still bloody expensive for me.

Meanwhile, the state hospitals here are often in a disgraceful state. The doctors I've been treated by themselves were good, but then there's the whole thing about how you have to slip them envelopes with wads of cash money because health care is only nominally ""free"", so there's that for people to (justifiably) complain about. 

I've also mostly been treated by doctors who seemed well past retirement age, because apparently all the young ones are fleeing to Britain and the West to earn some actual money. In fact, the government is introducing (or has introduced already, not sure) a law that obliges medicine students to sign a contract vowing to stay in Hungary for at least x (10?) years after graduation, or else pay a massive tuition fee after all.

Just from my personal experience:

The Catacombs seems to be often overlooked on most people's touristy destinations list, but something I would recommend. 

Paris has many, many museums but often are overlooked by tourists only here for a few days in favor of the Louvre and Musée d'Orsay (which could take up full days in it of themselves), if you are the artsy type I would look into a few on [this list](http://en.wikipedia.org./wiki/List_of_museums_in_Paris) being there for two weeks would give you some more time to explore.

I am assuming that Versailles is on your list. If you enjoy old castles there are two other rather large and famous ones a reasonable distance outside the city, [Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C3%A2teau_de_Saint-Germain-en-Laye) and [Fontainebleu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Fontainebleau).

While not in Paris, Normandy province borders the Île-de-France region which contains Paris. Mont-Saint-Michel and the Normandy Beaches are popular tourist attractions. I know other American tourists who did them as day trips (though long ones) from Paris and enjoyed themselves. 

Paris has many beautiful parks that don't get a lot of attention from tourists, I would recommend exploring a few of them. I happen to like Parc de Belleville and Buttes Chaumont.

Ratingen is quaint, but not much there really.

Go to Köln for sure. 

Dusseldorf (take the 712 from ratingen-about 30 mins) has some great/crazy nightlife known as the *altstadt*, you cant miss it. The area also has lots of great restaurants, ill recomend ""the fischaus"" if only for their amazing boullabaise and ""alt schumacher"" for some amazing german food. get a haxen with real sauerkraut.

Skip the altbier but do try the killipitsch. Dusseldorfer senf (mustard) is some of the best in the world.


Dusseldorf is also home to the largest japanese cominity outside of asia, go to any sushi bar on immermanstrasse for authentic japanese food. I like Naniwa. Also can get an amazing haircut.

Kaiserswerth is an ancient village with castle ruins surrounded by beer gartens, you might enjoy that. Its just to the north of dusseldorf.

The long run isn't defined as a period between 1-5 years.

&gt; This view is from CEBR, and is not held by the majority of City analysts.

You started with ""not a view shared by anyone I know"", then someone popped up and you skipped that; however, you claim a ""majority"" of views supporting your opinion, but this is not provable. Not that I'm asking for citations, because it would be meaningless.

You also forgot some bits from the same article:

&gt; Freed from the constraints of the single currency, strong countries such as Germany would see their currencies gain in price in relation to the pound, boosting British exports.

&gt; “If it breaks up the immediate pain is much more intense, but then there is a more stable basis and we would expect that within about 30 months growth will actually be faster than if the eurozone survives in its current form,” CEBR said.

You could obtain the full report from CEBR.

Neither of us knows what would really happen, we're not able to predict natural disasters and other phenomena. But in the long run, the UK would benefit from the collapse of the Euro. That's my view (although I'm pro-Euro), that's the view shared by many UK government officials, unofficially (pun intended). The shock wouldn't last.

true,almodozo,null,null,"&gt;Were the periphery not buying German goods with borrowed money in the first place, it would've simply not have contributed to German growth that much, but it wouldn't have made much difference in the long run.

Hmm. The PIGS countries (Portugal, Italy, Greece, Spain) together account for 12% of German exports - that's some 130 billion $'s worth of German products in 2010 alone. If that market collapses, I would hazard a guess it would have a serious impact on the German economy.

Meanwhile, the far-away markets are certainly growing at a rapid pace. But it's worth minding the proportions. Take the famous BRIC markets (Brazil, Russia, India, China). All the way [back in 2000](http://atlas.media.mit.edu/explore/tree_map/export/deu/show/all/2000/), they made for just 5.1% of German exports. Ten years on, it's 12.1%. A healthy and impressive growth, for sure. But that still merely makes these four booming behemoths ... just as important for the German economy right now as the failing PIGS countries currently are. They represent what is sure to be an ever increasing share of the market for German products ... but for now, the gradual growth in those markets wouldn't be able to shield Germany from the massive impact a collapse of the PIGS markets would hold. 

In short, the German economy has been partly doing pretty well this past decade, even through the financial crisis, thanks to those South-Europeans buying its products with money they borrowed from ... well, in part, German banks and the EU. As someone else further down this thread bitterly noted: "" Basically southern countries borrowed money from Germany to buy German goods."" It wasn't altogether a bad deal for the Germans, was it?
