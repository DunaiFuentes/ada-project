* Mickey - No one appreciated his resourcefulness or loyalty. Very underrated.

* Jackson Lake - Math Teacher/Adventurer/Father. Awesome.

* Sarah Jane - One of the more principled companions of The Doctor.

* Jack - is totally to humans as The Doctor is to Time Lords.

* Adelaide - Martian Pioneer/Scientist/Mother/Grandmother. Showed The Doctor exactly what she thought of him. 

* Martha - had mo chemistry with The Doctor and spent a majority of the series under his shadow, which I think was meant as an in universe tragedy because before meeting The Doctor she seemed pretty impressive in her own right. Capable medical student, taking care of a fractured family. Traveling with The Doctor was actually pretty horrible for her.

* Rose - I want her to be higher, but I cannot get over how carelessly she tossed Mickey aside, and then acted hurt when he began to move on. Also, she goes to pieces when the Doctor isn't around. She is brave, resourceful, and mostly compassionate; but she treats one of her oldest friends like dirt and never feels remorse over it.

Far too many people really do have no idea how to drive when there's snow and ice about.

Here's the LK guide to safe winter driving:

* Summer weather tyres are best, preferably with minimal tread so you've got the maximum amount of contact area
* Disable traction control, and if possible ABS to give you control not electronics
* Select first gear
* Remember to build up the revs before moving off, you wouldn't want to stall
* Dump the clutch
* On approaching corners, swing it in the opposite direction briefly, then start to turn and bury the accelerator
* If the corner's going well apply the handbrake (forcefully) for extra safety
* Speed should be between 20 and 30% greater than you would use in dry warm conditions

true,[deleted],null,null,"I dont mind people setting up ""groups"" .  It is parties that I don’t like.  The difference (as I would define it) is that if you are in a party they tell you where to stand, fund you and use the threat of de-selection to force you to vote as they want (the ""whip""), they also offer select people guaranteed places as MPs since about half of the UK are “safe seats” where you win based not on your personal record or opinions but based on being selected by a few local activists in a certain local branch of the party.

If you are in a group your a self made MP who votes only according to his conscience and his views of his electorate, it just happens that you sit with and spend time with people of similar opinions.

If there were no parties I think MPs would soon form their own groups (left vs right etc) but I think they would join the group they liked on an issues by issue basis (maybe you are left wing on civil liberties but right wing on the economy).

At the moment Parliament is effectively a one man rule where the PM decides what he wants and then the majority of MPs (who are in his party) (and it really is *his*) do what he says.  Meanwhile the opposition vote the opposite because they have to, knowing the bill before them will pass anyway, often having to vote against things they agree with and know their constituents want all for ""the good of the party"".

It seems like an elaborate charade with all laws written by one mans office and MPs really just turning up to vote like in the USSR where there is only one option on the ballot.

The only way the general population are permitted to give any input is to choose between the Labour and Tory clones (can you name a policy difference between them?).  Not everyone is permitted that “choice” since (as stated above) 50% of us live in safe seats surrounded by idiots who vote X because that’s what their dad voted, so X will be representing us even if X is Attila the Hun standing on a platform of killing and eating everyone under 5 in the area.

The result is a static government that grows more fat, corrupt and incompetent until enough people in their safe seats cant be bothered to vote for them to be replaces by people basically identical only 10 years younger who will (over the space of about 10 years) become just as fat, corrupt and incompetent.

That’s why the ruling party changes about every decade but everything stays the same.

Maybe Im exaggerating a bit but you have to agree that:

There is no chance of a third party winning and the two main parties are basically identical,

MPs very very rarely rebel and never rebel enough to prevent government policy becoming law

Opposition MPs may as well not turn up and probably would not if it was not for the photo OP.

There are very few MPs who do or say anything which is principled, original, outside of party policy or that in touch with what people actually want.

Claiming that money which, in retrospect, was not made is a 'cost' is nonsense. The only concession to this is the one sentence paragraph:

&gt; The Treasury, and some in the City, have always maintained that after years of “flatlining” they could not be expected to anticipate a spike in the price of gold.

Which is completely fucking true. Future gold prices follow a stochastic process and I'd guess that any analyst at the time would have listed a quadrupling in prices as a sub 1% case - i.e. something that is likely to happen only once in 100 times were the same initial conditions repeated. If the price of gold going down would be a complete disaster, of course it's correct to risk future profit for financial security, because the downside is so much greater.

Some CompSci uni courses seem to prioritise personal investigation, and have far fewer scheduled lectures.  However, that just means they expect you to spend the remaining time studying on your own, so that time isn't really compressible without students simply learning less (hardly ideal).

Some of that time is also ""wasted"" in beginner-level subjects because many of these courses take in people who've barely even touched a computer before, but I don't see how you can cut those classes without drastically cutting into the pool of people who can take a CompSci course... and if anything, we need more qualified computer types, not fewer.

A lesser degree isn't a bad idea, however - streamlining the smart kids into something like Comp Sci, and the ""I can just about use Word"" mouth-breathers into something else might be a way to go.

true,RobotBuddha,null,null,"It's something that's not altogether consistent. They've slowly developed on the idea as the series progressed. Right now I think it's more along the lines of the nature/nurture thing. The memories move along, as does some idea of a central sense of self. But the new body comes with genes coding for different behavioral traits, and basically a whole new brain along with the rest of the body. If your memories were encoded onto a blank brain, with different dna, would it be you? I think most of the doctors to this point would have said yes. Ten seems to side with no. 

It's something I'm glad they're dealing with a bit more now. Because doctor to doctor back in the day, there was often all the difference in the world between various regenerations. Though 8's a bit of a special case, being a bit of a botched regeneration and possibly screwed with even more by having a blood transfusion at the same time. 

Of course, one of the doctor's old companions, romana, had a really weird one. She basically just tried on new bodies before settling on one. There's non-canon implication that regeneration by injury forces a random body while a time lord/lady can also force a regeneration while healthy and get some control over it.

All in all, it's a bit inconsistent. Personally, I'd say that the current doctor is being a bit melodramatic. But it's understandable within the context of the show. Last of his species and getting really close to his final regeneration. Especially given the rate he's been burning through them.

1) The Parting of the Ways, particularly for Eccleston's automated recording in the TARDIS to Rose and the regeneration goodbye. He was very much a friend saying goodbye.

2) I loved Tennant's personal struggle to change back at the end of The Family of Blood, but I have to vote for his performance in Midnight. I actually didn't like Midnight because it felt like a Twilight Zone episode I'd watched, but forgotten about. However, Tennant completely nailed his own alien possession... the alien speaking through him as he kept a mostly straight face, but with a hint of internal struggle and fear over what was happening to himself.

For best overall episodes:

1) Empty Child / Doctor Dances. They're the most intriguing of the series, the ones I most enjoy re-watching and my picks for showing uninitiated viewers.

2) Blink is the scariest episode and the best for people new to Doctor Who, but for favorites I go with Sontaran Stratagem/Poison Sky... mostly because I completely love the Sontaran dialogue. Also, Turn Left gets high marks for making me not hate Donna anymore, finally coming to understand the character.

Some must-see episodes? Sure...

Genesis of the Daleks - The timelords send the 4th Doctor and his two companions to Skaro, with the mission of stopping the Daleks from ever coming into existence. This one has the Dalek race being created, and the first appearance of Davros. (6 parts)

Pyramids of Mars - The 4th Doctor and Sarah Jane Smith land in 1911, where they find an archaeologist, Laurence Scarman, who has been acting strangely after returning from a dig from Egypt. It turns out, he's attempting to free Sutekh, an evil member of the super powerful race of the Ossirans.. This is a very good episode. (4 parts)

City of Death - The 4th Doctor and Romana are enjoying Paris when they notice someone messing about with time. It's written primarily by Douglas Adams of Hitchhiker's Guide fame, and is quite entertaining. (4 parts)

The Visitation - one of those lovely ""psudeo-historicals"" that take place back in time and feature stuff out of history and dastardly aliens, this one begins when the 5th Doctor and his three companions land in 1666 and discover aliens at work.  (4 episodes)

Survival - Some people like this one, others don't.. It's sort of a template for the New Series, in that it involves a companion returning to her home.. which really had never been done before. Anyway, in it, Ace asks the 7th Doctor to take her to Perivale so she can see how her friends are doing. However, none of them are about... they've been taken to an alien world where they're being hunted by the Cheetah people who are being aided by the Master.
Forewarning: the 7th Doctor is a bit.. odd. (4 parts)

The Ambassadors....

of DEATH! - This one is with the 3rd Doctor, and it's quite long, but it's also quite awesome. The British have launched Mars Probe 7, but received no communication from it. So, they sent Recovery 7, to check up on their probe, but receive no communication again.. until Recovery 7 lands.. but who/what is in it?
This sounds kinda boring so far.. but it's not, as there's conspiracies as people are trying to steal the probe for their own ends.
(7 episodes)

When watching these, watch one or two episodes at a time, as it's better that way.

It is unreasonable for us to expect him to be treated any differently just because he holds a UK passport.

However, it is widely known that most countries in the far east apply the death penalty for drugs smuggling. Portrayals by the media as this being somehow just another Chinese human rights violation are unjustified. Furthermore, I don't think our diplomatic interventions were helpful, since the Chinese have long memories of the days of opium wars and the unequal treaties, when the boot was on the other foot.

* The woman WILF is seeing is an exiled Time Lord. Maybe Romana. But somebody who recognizes that the current Time Lord dude that is in power is out of control and needs to be ousted. She will resume command once Timothy Dalton is defeated.
* Time is going to get all timey-wimey and funky once the Time Lord crowd starts busting out of the time lock. The timelines will bleed together and bunches of aliens and weird stuff from the Doctor's past will be prancing around.
* Jack may prove to be a thorn in the side of the Time Lords, given that he's a fixed point in time when they are actively trying to destroy time.
* Donna's memory will be restored, probably healed by the immortality gate.
* It's the shipper in me, but I think the Doctor needs a bit of healing.

They stopped and started whispering together, and then I heard someone come closer and felt a hand touch the 'stone' of my dress. I instantly spun around into 'attack' mode, whereupon the pretty woman who had been touching my dress let out a shriek and jumped back about ten feet. She and the man started laughing uproariously, and the man said that she was absolutely terrified by that episode would probably have nightmares now. They asked if I could pose with her for a picture like I was attacking her. I said sure and posed. They shouted, ""Strangle her! Strangle me!"", so I did. Funny photo, we all laughed, they went their way.

2. I'm willing to bet White Guardian as well.  Note her hair, just like all previous White Guardian actors.  Hmmm...I wonder if Wilf is sort of part of the White Guardian.

3. (and 4) As it stands, there are no Time Lords except the Doctor.  You'll notice Timothy Dalton seems to be relating the episode as a story...i.e. it already happened and he's recounting the tale...the tale of ""The End of Time"" (At least thats what it sounded like to me).
So the Time Lords aren't back yet and they aren't actively trying to end time, I think they are essentially CELEBRATING those events.

Why are they celebrating?  Because that was when they were brought back into existance.

Here is my thought.  Since the Doctor decided to break the laws of time (Waters of Mars), he's caused a major paradox event.  Granted that episode ended with a slightly modified human history, but playing around with the laws is going to cause major issues....holes in time and whatnot.  

I think the doctor knows that, and its going to catch up with him...after all, at the beginning of ""End of time"", he comes out of the tardis after a major holiday.  Lay, silly hat, etc.  He talks about running around alone for a while (including getting married).  So I think he was living his last days (years) in style.

You'll notice there have been LOTS of hints of the actual death of the Doctor.  NOT just a new regeneration.  Song is ending, woman on the TV says there *might* be a chance to save him, the Doctor commenting on how and instant kill situation will prevent him from regenrating, etc.

So I think what will happen is the paradox/time laws catch up with him and all hell breaks loose.  Time is rewritten in some way, fixing all the things that went wrong.  The Earth is restored, Gallifrey returns along with the Time Lords.  

And while the Doctor gets killed completely from the event, Wilf and or the White Guardian (if thats who it is) are able to weave time AROUND the Doctor in order for him to avoid his ultimate fate.  

Of course the event is too much for his body to handle and thus must regenerate once again...kind of like taking on Time Vortex in ""Bad Wolf"".  But at least he lives.

* Someone on tvtropes theorized that The Woman is Susan Foreman, The Doctor's granddaughter from the William Hartnell years. I think Romana, The White Guardian, or a new character seems more likely, but I like to imagine.

* They have been setting up hints that he will actually die, and his former first self may be pulled forward or something, but I think they're just trying to put a shred of doubt into our hearts so that we can be overjoyed when he does regenerate. Maybe he'll be in a circumstance where he'll die permanently, but The Master will save him?

* If time ends, then time locks end? Personally, I think they are one second out of sync with the rest of time, since they explained the plot device in Sarah Jane adventures, and The Doctor did it to his Tardis in part one. They may be stuck there until someone effs around with causality, though.

There are also some questions you forgot..

* What's going to happen to Donna now that she 'remembers'?

* Who or what is accelerating the Ood's growth?

* What's the deal with Wilf?

I think Donna's going to be back (probably briefly) as full Timelord, and either be able to keep her memories and not her DoctorDonnaness, or die.

The Timelords were probably accelerating the Ood's development so they could be pawns.

A lot of hints have been laid the Wilf is a timelord, and 'Wilfred Mott' is an anagrams of 'Timelords FTW', but I'm holding out that he's a plain human. Maybe The Woman is Romana and she chose him for his attitude toward violence, maybe he has a history with some of the people affected by Human Nature/Family of Blood, or maybe he's another pawn of the Timelords.
