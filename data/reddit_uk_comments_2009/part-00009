I believe you'll eventually have more programming options that just what's on ITV.

There is only one major network holdout ([CBS](http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/apr2009/tc20090430_883835.htm)) and it will probably make a deal sometime in the future. Hulu has been wildly successful here (I'm an American), and the chances are it will be just as successful in the UK. From a [more recent article](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/6082786/Hulu-UK-launch-delayed-until-2010.html):

&gt;“Once ITV is on board, Hulu only needs one more UK broadcaster’s content for launch. It will probably go after a deal with BBC Worldwide, which is not signing exclusive arrangements with anyone and then secure some content from its parent companies. This will give it enough material to launch and probably take three to four months after its first deal with ITV.

true,bcash,null,null,"The answer to those questions, as everyone knows is: no, no and no.  Everyone knows it, but still it goes on.  It's hard to explain at first.  Even people who have dedicated themselves to children's causes - e.g. [Esther Ranzen this week](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8250795.stm) - publicly decry these ""protection"" measures as being counter productive.  So why do they get introduced if the local experts don't want them?

No one seriously believes that any of these actions makes the world a safer place.  But claiming the government has an evil 1984-style masterplan is giving the government too much credit, the truth is even worse than that.

The truth is that we've got ourselves (and by ""we"" I mean modern British society) into a death-spiral from which we will never recover.  The population demands that everything is black and white (for example: swine flu is either going to kill us all, or be media hype; they don't like the truth which is that it's a real but so-far mild disease, with a non-zero risk that it could mutate to be more severe, or even mutate to become trivial; there's no closure there).  Every time there is a disaster, an economic crisis, or media-hyped crime (stabbing, kidnap, murder, etc.); there has to be lessons learned, there has to be actions taken.  We won't tolerate anything else.  The truth of these situations, namely that irrational people will do irrational things, despite laws/regulations/best practices is not tolerated by society that believes everything can be fixed; and if it's not you're not trying hard enough.

Combine this phenomenon with a dying dead-tree press trying to attract an audience by launching cynical campaigns.  Combine both with an army of greasy-pole climbers in Westminster, working for nothing in ""think tanks"" trying to get ahead to a position of power; these people compete with each other, whoever can gain attention usually wins.

There are literally several thousand Oxbridge graduates working 16 hours a day to enslave us all.  But not for the reasons envisaged by Stalin, or 1984, or any of those other dystopian visions.  This one is much worse, much, much worse.  It is, quite literally, the road to hell that is paved with good intentions.  They're working to enslave us because that's what the Daily Mail wants; and it's what the Daily Mail wants because it's what the people want.  And it's what the people want because the people are idiots.  The people are proven idiots because when what they've been clambering for actually happens, they don't like it.

Democracy doesn't work.  About the only good thing with the American system is that it's not purely democratic; they combined democracy with inalienable rights which cannot be removed no matter how many people sign a petition.  We need something similar; or rather we needed it twenty years ago, it's almost certainly too late now.

The pension fund would not be subsidised by an unbreakable pledge to pay for the pension out of taxation. All payments would be fully costed. To implement this the public sector would probably have to have an increased budget but a known cost up front is better than an unknown cost in the future.

The major problem is that originally the public sector pay was terrible. The pension was sort of an offset. Ok you are paid £2/hr but you get a good pension. Since the minimum wage came in council workers are no longer paid £2/hr so the pension subsidy is no longer justified on the original grounds.

true,Shaper_pmp,null,null,"&gt; The occasional BIG documentary is hardly justification for the BBC's existence

Of course the BBC also takes a leading role in new media ventures (first radio, then TV, then video on demand, then the internet), has a [world-class R&amp;D division](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Research) that not only [pushes technology forward](http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/) faster than any other TV corporation in the UK, but also (due to their public ownership) usually permissively licence their inventions, or even make their [developments available to the public](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_codec) for free.

Being non-advertising and non-subscription-supported they also act to *keep the other channels and broadcasters honest*, by providing a professional-quality mainstream channel comparatively untainted by advertising demands or corporate agendas.  Again, if you want to see a TV ecosystem *without* this stabilising influence, just look at the USA (and I mean the whole broadcast spectrum, not just the small selection of the *very best individual programmes* that we import).

British TV serials are hampered by the fact that - compared to the USA - we're a tiny audience, so programme budgets are sharply limited by the amount of money programme-makers think they can realistically get back.

In the USA the audience is much larger and more fragmented/partitioned, and they typically have many more local broadcasters and cable channels, so the market for reselling/syndicating programs is *huge*.  This is why US programme-makers typically have budgets many times the size of UK ones, and why they routinely produce shows with seasons of 20-24 episodes, rather than the UK's normal 6-8.

Getting rid of the BBC would do sweet F.A. to address this problem, and would only lead to there being one *less* corporation with the funds to make large or expensive series, and one less stabilising influence stopping the UK TV market sliding towards Fox News territory.

Moreover, the BBC is a large and internationally-respected programme-maker, and the majority of British programmes you see syndicated to other countries are BBC programmes, so again it does a good (if subtle) job of publicising British culture overseas, in the same way the US tend to do a great job of ""Americanising"" foreign cultures (the UK included) through their music, film and TV-syndication industries.",0,1253283755,null,0,true,0,c0db24x,t3_9lrml,t1_c0db24x,t1_c0daztx,null,1426048376,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

It spent money televising stuff like the Royal Institute Christmas Lectures, creating interesting documentaries and generally informing the public.

By moving to ape Sky we are losing what made the BBC great. The fact that it didn't have to worry if the morons didn't want to watch relevant shows. The BBC provided a vital service that if it stopped would reduce our TV to the quality of Fox News. Ironically it hasn't stopped. It is trying to become more like Sky.

The sad thing about all this is Labour argue that the BBC have to chase ratings in order to justify the license.
