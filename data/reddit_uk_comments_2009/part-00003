[My name and address]

Email: \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*@hotmail.com

Thursday 26 March 2009
 
Dear Doug Henderson,
 
I am writing to you for two reasons.
 
First of all, I am deeply concerned about the methods the government are using to market their use of surveillance technologies, in particular camera networks, to the public.
 
I understand that camera networks and CCTV can be a cost effective way to protect a property or premises from damage or theft. However, their use in a recent Anti-Terrorist campaign by the Metropolitan Police has deeply worried me.
 
Although this campaign is not (as far as I know) being run in Newcastle, I hope you can take a moment to view a poster which is part of the campaign here:
 
http://www.met.police.uk/campaigns/counter_terrorism/sheet_road_cctv.pdf
 
You may have to copy this link into your browser's address bar.
 
Two things strike me about this image.
 
The first is that the poster is quite alarming, even to point of scaremongering. If we really are under that much of a terrorist threat, there must be better ways of dealing with that threat than by frightening the general public with such a message.
 
The second is that the poster encourages the routine reporting of anyone who studies the cameras. I am worried that this is setting a dangerous cultural precedent; the message is a divisive one: ""If you act in an unusal way, for example take a photograph of a nearby building or look at a surveillance camera for any prolonged period (and some of them do look unusual enough to warrant genuine curiosity from an innocent member of the public) you are potentially a terrorist"".
 
The public are not in a position to judge whether a person is a terrorist, certainly not from such a fleeting observation. False positives and the potential to cause great distress to innocent individuals are self-evidently possible and indeed probable on any reasonably long timescale.
 
This is undermining the public's trust in itself and could cause serious and irreversible divisions where opinions about surveillance differ.
 
I'm sure I don't need to point out that if the threat from terrorism is as great as we are being led to believe, social division is not something we can afford.
 
Also, and this is my main concern, the public's right to question the motives and methods of its government are fundamental to a democratic society and this poster represents a serious and far-reaching impediment to any such right.
 
The second reason I am writing is to learn what your positions are on these and related issues.
 
Are you in favour of these and similar surveillance systems? If so, for what reasons do you believe them to be necessary? Do you believe that there are no better ways to police our streets and protect our innocent?
 
If you are not in favour, what alternatives are there? Is it cost effective to put more officers, or similarly trained personnel on the streets? What are you doing to combat this escalation into what is already widely perceived as a future where personal liberty and freedom of opinion on these matters is under threat?
 
I appreciate the time you have given me here, and that the campaign I referred to above is not in your constituency, but it is clear that the methods used have been so with government approval. You are my first point of contact with that government.
 
Thank you for reading this email, and I look forward to your response.
 
Yours sincerely,
 
\*\*\*\* \*\*\*\*\*.

The reason that it does not occur in the UK is because there is no evidence that circumcision is beneficial to men on a large scale.

Of course there are occasions where to circumcise is the correct option, i.e. tight fore-skin, however to do it to a child that does not need it is purely cosmetic and not medical. Alternatively it can be called child-mutilation as Mephisto_sixx says.

Also before you go off on one about it not being mutilation. Consider this, female circumcision is carried out to remove the clitoris so that women do not or cannot get any pleasure from sex, from a male perspective circumcision makes the end of the penis much less sensitive as it is constantly rubbing and brushing against clothing where a circumcised penis is protected. both male and female circumcision attempt to achieve the same effect, that is to make sex less pleasurebale for the participants.

Hi all, 

Many apologies to those of you who received an almost blank email earlier. This is what it should have said...

I haven't sent any emails on this account for some time, for 2 reasons. The first is that I was having a lot of difficulty, despite some helpful assistance, in getting this mailout to work. As you can see, the system is not foolproof yet, and my fingers are firmly crossed on this email...

Secondly, while all that was going on, I got rather distracted by being hospitalised with pneumonia and things got put onto the back burner. However, the date is still set as June 15th.

I will write soon with some more news and links, if any are worthwhile. Feel free to send me suggestions. In the meantime, why not add our twitter account? You can find it at http://twitter.com/ccjacquismith - don't expect a lot from it yet but it will get more active as the day approaches...

&gt;Dear Sirs,

&gt;It has come to my attention that a tourist recently ran into trouble with the Metropolitan Police, I quote from The Guardian as follows:

&gt;Like most visitors to London, Klaus Matzka and his teenage son Loris took several photographs of some of the city's sights, including the famous red double-decker buses. More unusually perhaps, they also took pictures of the Vauxhall bus station, which Matzka regards as ""modern sculpture"".
But the tourists have said they had to return home to Vienna without their holiday pictures after two policemen forced them to delete the photographs from their cameras in the name of preventing terrorism.
[guardian.co.uk,	 Thursday 16 April 2009 12.53 BST]

&gt;I am planning a trip to London for exactly the same purpose: that of obtaining photographs both of red London buses, and bus stations.

&gt;I therefore request clarification, under the terms of the Freedom of Information Act, concerning the recent legislation regarding the taking of photographs in public places and specifically regarding the instruction of Police Officers in the enforcement of this new Law.

&gt;I shall delay my trip until such time as I have in possession a properly signed Home Office document stating clearly what the position is.


&gt;Yours sincerely,

The issue is a government with a proven record of incompetence, ignorance and corruption, having a database of all citizens.

I do not trust them to get the system secure - just look at the miriad of cases of lost cds/laptops/etc.

I do not trust them to use the system for legitimate means - just look at the miriad of cases of the new terror laws being misused, and our citizens abused with no legal recourse.

I do not trust them to keep the costs within set limits - just look at the miriad of cases of public money allocated to worthless projects, only for the costs to increase exponentially, while the competence levels drop.

Maybe he was rescued by the Cult of Skaro?) After he finds his way out, he'll fight w/ the Doctor, they're fighting will result in both of them dying &amp; needing to regenerate, but something will go awry and the master will get away.

EDIT Another thought, it seems to me w/ Tennant leaving, it may be possible that they're going to try to work Rose or Martha back in for at least a few Eps. Since they were quite popular companions, and David was very popular. I don't know if they'd want to go through a _complete_ wipe of the main cast and also a producer/head writer switch without some kind of ratings safety net. Viz, Rose (since Aygeman is on L&amp;O:London now. Which is an excellent show, btw). Perhaps -- at least for the season opener -- they'll work her into the show.

Another possibility: When the doctor cloned himself, his clone was more like him than he thought, in that he had the ability to regenerate like he does, and it just took a while for his second heart to grow in. He and Rose -- in the alternate universe -- came by a TARDIS and have been pettering about the alternate universe. When they run out of regens on the ""real"" doctor (my count is 1 left after this next Doc), they'll just bring the ""other"" Doc back...
