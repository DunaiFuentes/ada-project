&gt; The new set of rules, under section 76 of the 2008 Act and section 58A of the 2000 Act, will target anyone who 'elicits or attempts to elicit information about (members of armed forces) ... which is of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism'.

&gt; A person found guilty of this offence could be liable to imprisonment for up to 10 years, and to a fine.

Anyway, month-on-month figures are meaningless, always have been; there were many occasions during the boom years when the Halifax reported minus 2.5% and other such numbers.  The Halifax applies two main fiddle-factors which make month-on-month figures largely useless: ""mix adjusting"" and ""seasonal adjustments"".

For each sale included in the index, it's price is corrected to reflect its position in the local market: a smaller than average house gets it's price bumped up, a larger, down.  These are then all averaged together.  Finally a seasonal adjustment is added, in winter months a fairly large percentage is added.

Prices could have fallen 0.1% in actual transaction values, but Halifax would still report it as a 1.9% rise.  I don't have the non-seasonally adjusted numbers to hand, so I don't know what the real number is, but January is usually the most ""corrected"" month; the difference is that this January hasn't been the quietest month of the year (judging by mortgage approvals), hence this particular indicator is almost certainly over-inflated.

However, the ass-clowns in power and all of their proposals is almost guaranteed to raise house prices eventually; the trouble is they are destroying the currency twice as quick.

Well, I'd only say it is bad for home owners if their intention is for it to be a profit vehicle in commerce rather than something for living in.

My parents own their own home, - actually only Real Estate (an Equitable Title) rather than clear and outright as Allodium (an Allodial Title).  It doesn't matter what the prices of other houses on the market are doing being traded high or low, it doesn't effect the way you live in your house if you have one.

Of course, the actual price when you buy one is important though, and there's no way in my life I could ever afford a house. That's one reason I left working in London a few years ago and came to Japan.

&gt; **Mr. Craven-Ellis** asked the President of the Board of Trade whether the formation by the Government of the **United Kingdom Corporation** is only a war-time measure; and will he give assurance that the 'corporation' will be wound up immediately after hostilities cease, so that the export trade may flow through its normal peace-time channels?

&gt; **Mr. Johnstone** The 'corporation' was formed with a view to meeting difficulties in overseas trade which are due to conditions arising out of the war. It is impossible to foresee the conditions that will obtain when hostilities cease and, therefore, I cannot say whether at that date it will be desirable to terminate the activities of the 'corporation'. These activities do not, I think, disturb the normal channels of trade but I can assure my hon. Friend that His Majesty's Government have every desire that trade should be freed from war-time restrictions and be conducted in a normal manner at the earliest possible date.

&gt; **THE EARL OF CARLISLE** ... I have just returned from a stay extending over the greater part of three years in Turkey where I was the chief representative of the **United Kingdom Corporation**. I was also a member, and for some time Chairman, of the Anglo-American Co-ordinating Committee, as well as a member and Chairman of the Anglo-American Purchasing Committee. ...

HL Deb 24 February 1949 vol 160 cc1168-84...

&gt; **VISCOUNT SWINTON** ... Everybody agrees that it is right to make long-term arrangements with the Dominions and the Colonies to get increased food production. That means inevitably that you are going to take a minimum amount, and may mean that you have to give a minimum price. There are two ways of doing that. It can be done by price, or by preference. But that does not mean in the least that even where that kind of contract has to be entered into the whole operation has to be carried out by an incompetent department inside the Ministry of Food, instead of through the ordinary trade channels. May I take a specific example of what I myself had to operate in the war? At the beginning of the war I was asked to form a company called **The United Kingdom Corporation**, which had a turnover of over £150,000,000 a year. I was using entirely Government money; the Treasury was my sole shareholder. I formed a board of the ablest business men in the country. But the 1181 cardinal principle adopted was to use the ordinary trade channels at its instrument, and as a result the 'Corporation' made a profit and not a loss. ...

The 'corporation' was not only not wound down under the de-jure government but has become the de-facto authority over the people that apply for membership through the signature at birth and on acceptance of the NI (National Insurance) under the United Kingdom Corporation.  The COUNCILS, POLICE FORCES and COURTS are now also private corporations with Business Reports available on [Dun &amp; Bradstreet](http://dnb.co.uk/).

The Police Force, or more correctly named ""Policy Enforcement"" is for enforcing private corporate 'Policy', 'Codes' and 'Statutes' for financial gain. To protect and serve the corporate strucure under what is termed a ""Common Purpose"".  - Not the traditional Peace Officers that maintained peace in the Common Law between men/women and supported the community.
