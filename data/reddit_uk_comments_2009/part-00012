One of the explicit major purposes of the ID database is to tie all these disparate databases together into one large database by giving each person a unique ID key which can be used to uniquely identify one person across every system, permitting automated queries which reliably gather every detail ever stored about your in any government system into one place.

The reason people aren't more unnerved by this massive and wholesale invasion of privacy is because they either don't know about it, don't understand how much information about them is routinely collected by the government, or they simply lack the imagination to see why such an overwhelming centralisation of power in the government is dangerous to a free society.

Read [Little Brother by Cory Doctorow](http://craphound.com/littlebrother/download/) - it's a rip-roaring novel, but more importantly it's also basically a handbook on how to defeat technological surveillance and successfully resist a modern authoritarian state *disguised* as a novel.

It even has references at the end on every piece of technology used, where and how to acquire or build them, and where to go to find tutorials or more information if you're interested.

Vote for parties or individuals who oppose an ever-encroaching police state.  At the moment in the UK that's mostly the Lib Dems (the Tories are making some token protests, but that's largely them pandering the populist opinion because they're in opposition and don't have anything to lose by doing so).

Write to your MP, using a service like [WriteToThem.com](http://www.writetothem.com/) if you don't know who that is.  So few people bother to do it these days that they *do* take notice.  You should at least get back a non-form-letter addressing your complaints, and your letter may well be forwarded on to the office of whichever government minister is responsible.

Sign petitions and/or join organisations like [No2ID](http://www.no2id.net/).

Know your rights, and exercise them.  When police illegally try to stop you taking photos of them, [use countermeasures](http://www.gandhicam.org/) to stop them being able to prevent you (disclaimer: I'm involved in the gandhicam project - I haven't had a lot of time recently, but a new version should be coming out soon which supports e-mail as well as website-uploads to get your pictures out of the location as quickly as possible, before they can be seized, sequestered or deleted).

But most importantly of all, educate yourself and others around you on the issues, and why the government's unprecedented power-grab is dangerous to democracy and individual freedoms (the recent and unprecedented restrictions on public photography are a good one to illustrate this).

I was in Australia when Pauline Hanson's One Nation party appeared, a similaly right wing/fascist/populist party with a seemingly charismatic leader, who the media loved, (think Sarah Palin but with red hair) the left wing loved to bash her and the right wing found her attractive.

her vicious and quite despicable views kept getting expressed, the media kept following her about, often in disapproval but still garnering her converge, and for a time it looked like she could be a serious contender for a position of power.

then she revealed her party's ideas on tax.

and you could see the moment she did, everything changed, the newscasters breathed a sigh of relief, everything was okay, because she was a crackpot, a nut case who in no way could be trusted with the running of the country and now it was plainly obvious for everyone to see.

the One Nation party scraped by to get a small number elected members of the Australian parliament, and in no time they fell apart to infighting bitterness and corruption.

For the vast majority of people in the UK no matter what Nick Griffin said they would never change their mind about him, I spent my youth a white kid in a majority Asian and Caribbean area where hanging out in the 'whiter area' up the road meant getting beaten up by skin-heads, my family are descended from both economic and asylum seeking immigrants, for me it is unthinkable that I would support them even in protest but his normalising appearance on a political show is a boon for those who are ignorant of history and sympathetic to his more 'populist' ideas, little by little he becomes an acceptable voice in the national conversation.

A strike is basically with withdrawing of your labour - the last piece of power that the working person has. When you withdraw your labour, or strike, you're *supposed* not to turn up to work, that's the point. 


Picking is different. Its an activity that you can do alongside a strike to make your point stronger, if you like. Picketing whilst on strike is voluntary. But its a good idea. The idea of it is that you post some strikers at the door or entrance of your work place to encourage other workers to take part in the strike, and to re-enforce the idea of the 'picket line' (an imaginary line you do not cross). There are laws and guidance surrounding pickets, for example, the police can genuinely be called out to break up a large scale picket,under UK laws, so if you see small picket lines and think they look weak and insubstantial, thank Baroness Thatcher! 


As for strikes, if it has been legally called, ie balloted and the employer given notice, the employee cannot sack you for it. 


Interestingly, an employee also has the right to withdraw their labour without giving notice if they do so for under 15 mins.

&gt;

Dear Sir or Madam,

It has come to my attention that numerous meetings, communications
including telephone calls etc.. have taken place between members of
the HCA, and lead members of our local mosque. Promises have
apparently been made, including funding of a new mosque on the
Blackwall Reach Regeneration Site, on the Northwest corner of the
site at the old St Matthias school site.
So here are my questions:

1. How many meetings have taken place between members of the HCA,
(Laura Outhart, Eleanor Purser or any members of the HCA) in
regards to the Blackwall Reach Regeneration Site and members of the
currently existing members of the Mosque. Could you please provide
Dates Times etc including supporting documentation.

2. What promises or offers of funding (fully, partially or
otherwise ) have been made to this Mosque in regards to building,
relocating this building from the South East corner of the St
Matthias Site to the North East Site.

3. Are the HCA or its regeneration partners planning on building a
mosque or providing full or part funding for a new mosque as part
of the Blackwall reach regeneration site?

4. Could you provide any and all reports or documentation regarding
just the mosque and its relocation, redevelopment etc, that have
been provided to lead members of the mosque, and others.

If any of this information is restricted in anyway under the terms
of the Freedom of Information Act 2000, could you please let me
know how my request can be revised to provide some semblance of the
information i require.

If any of the information is refused on the basis of the format of
delivery (in this instance email) can you please let me know what
format of delivery it can be delivered before refusing on this
basis.

&gt; First, you tell kids that it is okay to have sex, just use a condom. You teach them how to put on a condom with a banana. Yet if you give that same banana to a monkey, supposedly down a few rungs on the evolutionary scale, he knows what its real purpose is. He's not stupid. He eats it.

&gt; Then when the kids have sex without using birth control, (maybe thinking that because they don't have a banana with them that the condom is useless), you want to take their babies away.

What?

No, underage kids are allowed to bring up their own kids, as long as the underage kid's guardian acts as a legal guardian until the underage kid is old enough (16 or 18 - I forget which) to look after their own kid themselves.

People who are *assessed to be mentally incapable of looking after themselves* aren't allowed to marry (at least, IIRC, not without the permission of a guardian), and if they have kids those kids may be removed on the basis that if someone's not competent to look after themselves, they won't be capable of looking after a small child.

It's not a ""thick"" thing - it's a ""mental impairment"" thing.  And while the social services might have over-reacted in this case, the idea that you don't let someone who has been judged incapable of looking after *themselves* be responsible for looking after a vulnerable child (or take life-changing decisions like getting married) is a good one.

&gt; **Usage Note:**  Flaunt as a transitive verb means ""to exhibit ostentatiously"": She flaunted her wealth. To flout is ""to show contempt for"": She flouted the proprieties. For some time now flaunt has been used in the sense ""to show contempt for,"" even by educated users of English. This usage is still widely seen as erroneous and is best avoided.

[Merriam Webster](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/flaunt) recognises that *flaunt* arose from confusion with *flout* but suggests that it is now considered an acceptable alternative:

&gt; **usage** Although transitive sense 2 of flaunt undoubtedly arose from confusion with flout, the contexts in which it appears cannot be called substandard &lt;meting out punishment to the occasional mavericks who operate rigged games, tolerate rowdyism, or otherwise flaunt the law — Oscar Lewis&gt; &lt;observed with horror the flaunting of their authority in the suburbs, where men…put up buildings that had no place at all in a Christian commonwealth — Marchette Chute&gt; &lt;in our profession…very rarely do we publicly chastise a colleague who has flaunted our most basic principles — R. T. Blackburn, AAUP Bulletin&gt;. If you use it, however, you should be aware that many people will consider it a mistake. Use of flout in the sense of flaunt 1 is found occasionally &lt;“The proper pronunciation,” the blonde said, flouting her refined upbringing, “is pree feeks” — Mike Royko&gt;.

Either way I was unaware of the confusion between the two so I thank you for enlightening me.
