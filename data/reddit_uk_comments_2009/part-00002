Pressed to admit he had made mistakes, he said: ‘No, it was supply. If inflation is low, people are going to borrow money to buy houses. You can’t stop that. You don’t understand it.’ 

Inflation was not low - the government redefined inflation to exclude house prices.  And there is no real shortage of houses, only an excess of housing restrictions.  In parts of the US where there are minimal planning restrictions - HOUSTON, there was no house price bubble.

true,JeebusWept,null,null,"I've got a 104% mortgage through Northern Rock, secured in October 2007, 18K of which is unsecured loan. The only redeeming feature of this is that the house we bought was completely fucked when we bought it from an old couple going into a retirement home, so by the time we've renovated it should be worth just about what we owe on it (without interest of course), so by the time we come to renegotiate the mortgage in October 2012 when the fixed-interest period has expired we should be able to move house. I wouldn't have been able to get a mortgage at the time without 100% + mortgages  as I had no deposit (100%+ were not offered by any bank as of April 2008 by my understanding).

The kicker is that a year after I took on the mortgage both me and my girlfriend (who is joint mortgage holder) both got better jobs and our earnings increased by about £15K/year, so if we had stayed in rented accommodation for another year we would be in great shape to quickly save up a deposit (a 10% deposit is the minimum you will get a mortgage with these days) and buy a better-appointed house on a much more favourable mortgage, in a nicer neighbourhood than we have now. Live and learn. 

We can easily afford the house we're in now, our total outgoings (everything, mortgage, utilities, food, insurance, commuter travel etc etc) are about £1800/month and we bring in around £3000/month between us, so we're able to afford the renovations by saving up and we can have a little bit of a social life and some treats now and again too. 

My main worry is that one or both of us gets made redundant. I work in the oil and gas sector which is volatile to say the least, but the company I work for hasn't laid a single person off in over 20 years of operation. My girlfriend gets half of what I earn but her job is more at risk, she's a database administrator for a company that makes software for vets and her company has been laying people off.
