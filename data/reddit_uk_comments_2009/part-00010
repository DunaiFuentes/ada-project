There are two reasons you're asked to confirm the first line of your address - first, it's a good way to error-check; the postcode in Northern Ireland is probably only one letter different from yours, this way I can be sure I heard you correctly. Secondly, postcodes don't give me your full address - I need to know which house name/number to use.

**GEEKY BIT** - Below is an explanation of how postcodes work.

Postcodes are fairly logical- the two halves do different things. The first half tells the 'sending' post office which city to send it to, the second half tells 'receiving' post office which street, or part of street, it's on. For example, say my postcode's SL9 7AA. SL9 means SLough, the 9 means Gerrards Cross. 7 is an area that roughly co-insides with a part of Gerrards Cross called Dukes Wood and AA would identify my house to within 12 addresses on my road.",0,1254072618,null,0,false,0,c0dnrdp,t3_9oip0,t1_c0dnrdp,t1_c0dnfgk,null,1426055448,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8
