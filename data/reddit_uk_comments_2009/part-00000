Yeah, because the Bank of England and the private banks keeps allowing the money supply to be inflated, thus devaluing and debasing each unit of currency that we hold and save, and leading to the continual centralisation of wealth into the hands of those that own and run the banks and the large corporations with low cost debt.

Just think how much each unit of currency has lost its value over the last 25 years due to the bankers continual creating more money and lending it out as debt.

This is why the amount of debt always increases faster than even the amount of money in existence increases, and as it continually happens we all become worse off and have to work harder and harder to keep up as this wealth is ever more centralised towards the very wealthy.

Borrowing from nobody (also knows as ""turning on the printing presses"") isn't going to help.

If the banks were fully nationalised, has anyone thought through the consequences?

1.  It wouldn't change the balance sheet of the banks, the only solution to that is for a government bail-out (which is coming tomorrow); which will further damage the currency.

2.  It means government interference in the lending process.  This will also be announced tomorrow, that Northern Rock will be obliged to lend to hardworkingfamilies (i.e. groups most likely to vote Labour) and ""other people who are designed to benefit from it"".  The inevitable conclusion is that banks in public ownership will become more crippled over time, not less.  Later privatisation will be impossible.

3.  Mass overstaffing of the retail banks.  If they're all Gordon Brown Financial Genius Lenders Ltd. why does every small town need five branches?  I can't imagine branch closures going down well; which means it probably won't happen, which will be even more wasteful.

In other words: banks, which have been a profitable staple of the British economy for hundreds of years will be prevented from ever being independent businesses ever again.  And that will leave us with what, exactly?  Tourists?

I know it is related to bonds because I have a friend who is a Barrister amongst other things in the legal profession, and the Temple, and he deals with the bonds a lot - Statutes and the Judges' bond that magistrates and other members of the court *act* under.

The Statute has to be bonded to be applicable to any 'person' or other *legal-fiction*.

Relevant liens and lawful Claims (such as a ""Claim of Right"" and ""Lawful Excuse"") also come into play if you enter a court (at which point you should be bonded) to discuss/argue Statutes.  Although most people don't present any Claims, are not bonded and have no notice of a lien so they can go ahead and enforce any Statute with your consent (by your under-standing or silent acquiescence).

But that's as much as I know.  I know 'Acts' are different but I don't know the details.  Perhaps 'Acts' result in the drawing of the 'Statutes'? - I'm not sure yet.  I'm still studying.

PS. A **lien** is a kind of security interest granted over an item of property to secure the performance of some  obligation.

PPS. A **bond** is a security obligation, in which the authorized issuer owes the holders an obligation.

true,FreeManAndHisDog,null,null,"&gt; **Do you know the truth about the EU?**

&gt; **1** The Queen has signed 6 of the 7 EU Treaties.

&gt; **2** The 6 treaties define and build the EU as an unelected dictatorship.

&gt; **3** The EU's laws give it the powers of a police state.

&gt; **4** The 7th EU treaty will complete the abolition of Britain as a nation

&gt; \- the Queen could sign it in as little as two years.

&gt; Shouldn't we repeal the 1972 European Communities Act now before we are imprisoned inside?

&gt; **5** Thirty four years inside the EU - have you noticed how our democracy is being withdrawn?
The EU has denied us that most basic of human rights - the right to vote against the EU and to keep our own nation. A majority of us don't want to be in the EU. We are being forced in against our will.

&gt; Do you feel you've become powerless, or your vote is worth less? The six treaties are removing our democracy and harmonising our laws with the EU; 70% of Parliament’s new laws are the EU’s, not ours. Isn't the real reason people have lost interest in politics precisely because the EU has taken away our ability to change things?

&gt; Common law, where government was our servant, is now largely replaced by the EU's Corpus Juris, where the government is the ruler, we are the ruled, and don't participate. We have lost most of our rights (including habeas corpus). The power of government grows unchecked. Yet politicians lie about the EU, pretending its not significant.

&gt; **6** Massive EU corruption
The EU's auditors have found the fraud is so widespread they've refused to sign the EU's accounts for ten years. Whistleblowers like Marta Andreason, the EU Budget Director, who in 2005 found the EU couldn't account for 95% of its £66 billion budget, are simply fired for telling the truth.

&gt; **7** The bribing of our Politicians by the EU
Europe works by bribing politicians with huge salaries and expenses to vote for Europe, against the best interests of their voters. So Labour, Conservatives and the Lib Dems are all in favour of the EU - a Westminster one party state.

&gt; **8** EU corruption is exploding in our Civil Service, local government, and 7,000+ quangos.
Common Purpose is the glue that enables fraud to be committed across government departments, most of it lining the pockets of politicians and bureaucrats. It often involves the sale of public assets such as land to friends of politicians or their businesses. The CEO of Common Purpose is Julia Middleton of the ODPM.

&gt; **9** Businesses closing under EU regulation
The EU's 111,000 regulations will close hundreds of thousands more businesses when fully enforced, and control our private lives more closely than those of Soviet citizens. (In a Parliamentary answer to Lord Stoddart in January 2003, the government said there were 101,811 EU regulations, growing at 3,500 pa.)

&gt; **10** The EU costs us £200 billion pa, 20% of our economy

&gt; According to the government's Better Regulation Task Force, complying with EU regulations now costs our economy over £100 billion a year. Economists say we lose £80 billion pa by associating with the EU's inferior economies. The EU took our fishing industry, which costs us £5 billion pa. EU damage to other industries a further £20 billion. Our EU contribution is £10 billion. Taxes have doubled in real terms since we've been in the EU, leaving little money left for a growing underclass struggling to make ends meet.

&gt; **11** Our counties to be abolished

&gt; The Queen signed the 1992 Maastricht Treaty, which adopts the EU Regionalisation Plan. This will abolish England's 48 counties and replace them with 9 European regions, each with their own Regional Capital, which reports directly to Brussels, not to Westminster. This effectively eliminates the country of England.

&gt; **12** The EU's dispossession of the English.

&gt; The 1997 Amsterdam Treaty gave the EU control of our immigration; they’ve increased it ten fold, overcrowding our cities and putting millions on minimum wage. With the seventh treaty abolishing our nation, then our counties, the EU ruling us from Brussels with the laws of a police state, and the English already at the bottom of every government, legal and politically correct queue, we will literally have no place we call home.
