&gt; What we now tend to call ""upper-"" and ""working class"" are really just the higher and lower ends of the middle class.

I strongly disagree. You're using an archaic meaning of the word middle class. A more relevant definition is that the working class consists of people like tradesmen, shop workers, factory workers and lower-grade office workers, whereas the middle class consists of professionals and managers (and the upper class consists of aristocrats and royalty, pretty much as before).

There's also the Socialist Workers Party definition of working-class, which is basically that a working-class person is anyone who depends on their income from employment to live, rather than an unearned income. I find this quite an attractive definition, although it seems to fall down when applied to high-level managers.

true,moneyprinter,null,null,"When you *submit* an *application* for ""license"", you stand under their law and thus agree to the terms and conditions of the contractual agreement; - you receive a ""license"" forming a co-partnership between your *artificial person* that you operate in commerce, and the Licensing Authority, and so you take on a limited liability status thereunder.

Depending on the terms and conditions you submitted to (contractual obligation through ""license""), you may agree to anything and surrender any rights you choose.

As this is private contract, you stand before a Nisi Prius court ( - a court by prior arrangement - i.e. established when you sign the document and take on the ""license"") and have already granted them full  authority to make judgement.

You have already surrendered your unalienable right at common law to travel in return for the limited liability status of ""driver"" in commerce when you *applied* and *submitted* for the ""license"".

This is what a license is; - a private contractual arrangement whereby one (the ""licensee"" under limited liability) stands under the private law - the terms and conditions - of the Licensing Authority (the ""licensor"" holding full liability).

It is the Licensing Authority that may also write the Insurance Policy for the licensee, and this policy is enforced by Policy Enforcement (POLICE) Officers.

The Policy Enforcement Officers then *act* as revenue collection agents on behalf of those that hold the Insurance Policy, - usually bought by banks in commercial / financial instruments from the Licensing Authority that is a *corporate-entity*.
