**On Campus**

Don't miss Freshers Fair in your first week - it's a huge set of stalls for all of the on-campus societies, of which there are probably about a hundred. Great way to meet like-minded people. Join loads.

The student cinema is one of the best in the country - their sound system is better than the local multiplex. If you join the cinema society and turn up to help usher you can get in free. Otherwise it's still quite cheap.

The campus bars are rubbish but at least you can bring takeaway into them. The Charles is better but often very crowded.

There are porters in every college. They are very used to confused or lost students. Ask them for help.

**Getting Around**

The course you're doing is probably based at King's Manor in the city centre so getting a bike (and a strong lock!) will save you heaps of time.

Don't go down rape alley at night on your own. (http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=d&amp;source=s_d&amp;saddr=Heslington+Rd&amp;daddr=53.95162,-1.062006&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=FTg2NwMdStXv_w%3B&amp;mra=mi&amp;mrsp=1,0&amp;sz=17&amp;sll=53.951066,-1.060824&amp;sspn=0.002222,0.007832&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=53.950896,-1.060996&amp;spn=0.004445,0.015664&amp;t=h&amp;z=16 ).

Don't go into the city centre on a weekend. All the tourists make it a nightmare.

**Food**

The Willow is a good chinese all-you-can-eat buffet restaurant and, unlike Jumbos or whatever the place on Rougier St now calls itself, hasn't been repeatedly shut down for health and safety reasons. Oscars (off Little Swinegate iirc) do very large, really nice pub food. The sushi/noodle bar ""Buzz"" round the corner is worth a visit too.

The Go Down on Clifford Street is my favourite bistro-type restaurant. Very good quality at a moderate price. Good place to take a date to impress them. The Blue Bicycle on the other hand is massively overpriced.

The best Indian takeaway is Zaf's on Heslington Road. Efe's nearby did good pizza when I left, but it had used to be awful so could change back!

Strong ties to the Government and their agenda's, he  advises them! He will stand to gain much if this system were put into place. Google it your self to check :) A very biased article if I do say so my self.

Imagine in the future your kids walking down the street, wondering what it must be like to do something with out being watched? Or would they even think to question that they could have ever done something on their own privately? With nobody logging and saving their information as they went through their everyday life. No cameras recording them, or anonymous people knowing their most personal health problems because they are stored on a massive database etc? They will be just being another ""number"" or statistic. Wondering what it must be like to be free.

Do we really want to let our children be born into a world like this?

In the future no one will know freedom, only the people with the power and access to the information of the people they control.

This is of course if we choose to take the first few steps down this road, a road we will never ever be able to turn around on.

Based on what?  The security company suddenly demanded up-front payment and had to be changed (not the festival organisers' fault), and the local council apparently raised multiple 11th-hour objections that they'd never raised before, at such a late date that the festival organisers couldn't possibly satisfy them in the time left.

&gt; I was, frankly, amazed that the Police demanded wristbands from the BGG for undercover work. If it had been my festival I would have told them to fuck off and buy their own like every other punter.

With respect, you clearly know little or nothing about organising public gatherings like festivals - if it had been your festival you would never have got even preliminary permission to stage it.

Local police and councils have the power of veto over any festival in their area - you have to provide ""adequate"" security, and take ""adequate"" measures against drugs and other crimes (where ""adequate"" depends entirely on the police/council's judicial and political priorities that year).

If festival organisers tell the police to fuck off, they can easily find they can't get a licence at all.  If you hire your own security but the local police/council think they'll be too lax (or would turn a blind eye to some things the police wouldn't), you won't get a licence.  If you hire your own security but the police demand to have undercover officers in the crowd (and demand free wristbands for them), if you refuse you won't get a licence.  Fuck with them even in the slightest, or don't give them exactly what they want and you won't get a licence.

Seeing the pattern yet?

Even *Glastonbury* has started cracking down - a few years ago they put up the security fence (under threat of no licence), then a couple of years later they upped the police presence (ditto), and then again after that (*also* under threat of licence-denial).  A couple of years ago they had police *wandering through the campsite and stationed in the stone circle all night*, with instructions to nick anyone they even saw having a quiet spliff around a camp-fire (we know because we saw a guy wander up and *ask* them flat-out).  This was *not* Michael Eavis' idea.

The government, local councils and regional police forces are cracking down on the freedom and hands-off attitude festival organisers want and festival-goers expect.  If you're trying to set up a festival of any kind and don't immediately bend over and grab your ankles on demand, you don't get a licence for your festival, and your company goes bankrupt.  Even Glasto (traditionally the largest and most hands-off of them all) has been forced to comply, under threat of having their licence denied.

I'm a card carrying AAA geezer at Glasto having been to every single one, so I can confirm much of what you're saying. Nevertheless I still wouldn't hand out wristbands to the cops, unless they were happy with special ones with little blue flashing LED's on them. They are hardly undercover if I'm handing out wristbands are they? 

Look, if your ""alternative"" festival is going to follow precise recipes from the government we may as well give up may we not? At Glasto we have several different layers of festival organisation: there's the Live Nation UK layer, formerly known as Mean Fiddler (headed by Melvyn Benn)  - which handles the licencing issues and invented the fence and many of the modern systems of festival management which comprise both sensible and stupid rules and regulations and provide us with Silver and Gold command, the onsite and emergency offsite offices that preside over the event with an iron fist backed up by cops, emergency services and burly security fuckheads. Alongside this Michael and the rest of the real festival people do what they have always done. It's that balance of Euro-style Nanny-State officialdom (which makes the show legally possible) and the anarchic, largely unregulated and incredibly diverse bunch of people who actually put the show together (I include the punters in this). It's kind of like the Officialdom = the Brakes. The rest of us = the Accelerator and after about noon on Friday nobody has any idea where the steering wheel is.

By the way, you may not be aware of it, but Live Nation UK were fomerly known as Clear Channel UK and are an offshoot of the ultra-right-wing organisation Clear Channel from the USA - how fucking weird is that?

Anyways: if you're going to base your flame on the idea that the way forward with festivals is to cave in at every opportunity to these rule-book waving tossers, then you don't want to get into the festival business. As far as I'm concerned people have been gathering on the grassland of England for big parties ever since there was grassland to gather on and it ought to be a legal right to do so. Sure we need regulations to keep people safe etc. but all this twatting around with fine print just sucks and it is to be stood up to, not bowed down to.

Back to my point: the BGG team did fuck up.

It's true that Mendip reversed their position after pressure from the Police who disliked the festival on acount of fund-raising activities for Plane Stupid and the Climate Camp. Normally the cops would use an event like this for intelligence gathering though, so that isn't the whole story. I've been talking to people on the BGG team and there is a general feeling of incompetence there. Nobody has yet explained to me why they ""handed their licence back"".

I probably needed taking down a peg or two but try being a little nicer in future, I wasn't slagging *you* off.

His main example is the Â£6.2 billion M25 expansion, estimated to cost closer to Â£0.5bn by The Campaign for Better Transport, but because it's funded by private investors who want to make lots of money out of it, the scope's been reduced and the price bloated out of all proportion.

Public liabilities for other similarly bloated and inefficient schemes amount to about Â£215bn, but they're not properly counted as public debt because apparently it's politically expedient not to do so.

Blair's parents were Blair and Corscadden.  A little further digging reveals that John Major's mother's maiden name was Coates, so we have Major and Coates.  Thatcher's parents were Roberts and Stephenson.

true,CharlieDancey,cnty-england,England,"On morning I woke up and offered to take my girlfriend's kids to school before I made the 70 mile drive on to work. I arrived to find my car had been clamped, on private ground, in a lane open to the main road. People often parked there and there were a few signs up about it, but I'd been a bit naughty I guess.

Anyway, the sign had a phone number on it and advised me that the release fee was Â£140. But I only had about Â£20 and the kids were going to be late for school and so on and so forth. Just down the lane was my mate's metalwork shop, and i noted that they'd clamped a front wheel, not realising that the car was rear wheel drive.

I stuck it in first, drove screeching the 50 yards to the workshop door walked in and grabbed an angle grinder and an extension cord. The clamp was off in about 15 seconds.

I carried it to the bottom of the lane and chucked the two parts in the river where they vanished into the water with a satisfying ka-ploop!

I dropped the kids off at school on time and hit the highway. On the way I called the number on the sign.

""Hi I'm the owner of the Orange Mazda 323! You clamped me.""

""Well I can't get to you for about an hour you'll have to wait.""

""No, you don't understand...""

""Look mate they all say that...""

""No you really don't...""

""Listen fuckface!""

""There's no need to be rude.""

""You what? Interfering with...""

""I cut it off with an angle grinder.""

""That's criminal damage! Where is it?""

""In the river.""

""But they cost Â£240!""

""Well you should have thought about that before you stuck it on my car.""

""Why didn't you just pay the fine? I'll have to buy a new one.""

""I didn't have the money mate. Anyway it's in the river. You've got my registration  number, so I guess you'll have to call the cops. Don't ever clamp me again.""

I never heard a thing.

Another nice little scam I heard of involved cars being towed away. Could be an urban legend, but the game went like this: You buy a cheap Mercedez Benz, something with a high book price but actually pretty fucked and you park it where you *know* it will get towed away. Sure enough the truck comes along, the car gets lifted and taken to the pound, which is privately run.

Then you go and firebomb your own car in the pound.

You turn up in a sharp suit with the cash to collect it.

""Ah,"" they say ""there's been a slight problem...""

Apparently the people in the pound would settle in cash, on account of being dodgy bastards themselves, using the dealers prince guide as a reference.

True? False? Who cares, its the idea of the ordinary guy getting back at these bastards that we love so much.

Alas, since pretty much *by definition* people from different cultures are different in such areas as tolerance, rationality, dogmatism and belief in universal human rights, I'm going to suggest that as a philosophy it's irrevocably, fundamentally flawed, at least at this point in history, with many of the present cultures we have in the world.

It's a bit like free-market libertarianism, where if everyone was perfectly rational, perfectly generous, acted in perfect long-term self-interest, had perfect knowledge of the markets and had perfect freedom of choice in every situation, it would all work out wonderfully... except that in reality people are frequently stupid, irrational, working from deeply incomplete knowledge, act against their own best interests and/or lack adequate choice or opportunities to make the system work.

With multiculturalism it goes more like ""if everyone was as enlightened, hands-off, non-judgemental and respectful of others' rights as we are, we could all live alongside each other without friction and everything would be wonderful"".

Alas, it's not the case - people are often selfish, judgemental and ideologically-invasive, and that's why you can't peacefully and multi-culturally integrate - say - a group of reactionary, misogynist, fundamentalist religious types right alongside a commune of drug-taking, lesbian hippies and expect there not to be tension.

The critical distinction is that there **is** strong evidence in that case.  If there weren't, people would be wrong to disagree with ID advocates.

To meaningfully disagree, you have to dispute the premise - that there has been no correlation found between passive smoking and cancer, not the form of the argument, which is perfectly valid.

And there is in fact evidence for the effects of passive smoking.  At one time wannabejosh would have a point - the connection was actually pretty tenuous and plagued by politics up till the 80's or 90's.  However, this is out of date information.
