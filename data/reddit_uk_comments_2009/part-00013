&gt; In terms of a potential cause of violence, alcohol certainly is a cause.  In terms of drugs it's a similar picture but to a lesser extent.

It's admittedly hard to find good statistics on this, as the government typically resists directly comparing the effects of alcohol vs. drugs on crime, likely due to the fact that it gains political capital by raking in vast sums from taxing one, and *spending* vast sums prosecuting use of the other.  Nevertheless, the Superintendent of Operation Safer Streets (specifically tasked with tackling street crime) should be a fairly persuasive piece of evidence in favour of the idea that alcohol causes more violent crime than drugs.

Also note that elsewhere in the video he makes the same point I do - addictive drugs (heroin, cocaine) tend to fuel acquisitive crimes rather than violent ones, and alcohol tends to make people more aggressive and confident, leading to more fights and violent crime.",0,1257337819,null,0,true,0,c0fbq3b,t3_a0890,t1_c0fbq3b,t1_c0fa7yj,null,1426088888,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Drug naive non criminals who become heroin dependent tend to remain so, albeit they may raise funds in socially less acceptable ways and waste funds which could've gone towards things which society approves of more (like good food, education, family etc.).

The pool of alcohol users is obviously enormous and whilst a small(ish) percentage may use problematically the numbers (and therefore the social effects) are still large.  Alcohol is a factor in perhaps the majority of domestic violence, fights, stabbings, murders, rapes, etc. etc.  I like a glass as much as the next man (probably more) and I'm certainly not calling for a new prohibition, but on any sensible analysis alcohol causes more social harm than cannabis.",0,1257338057,null,0,false,0,c0fbq6f,t3_a0is3,t1_c0fbq6f,t1_c0fbpbo,null,1426088890,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Total year?  Total episodes?  Total episode length?

Tom Baker (and lets face it...he is THE Doctor that all other Doctors are compared to) was the Doctor for 7 years.  42 episodes, and I've never done the math, but the new Dr Who is based along hour long episodes.  The old Who was based along a longer storyline (usually 2 hours or so) with 30 minute episodes.

Baker hit 42 episodes (and again each episode was usually in 3 or 4 parts).  Lets say 3 parts at 30 minutes each...gives us about 63 hours worth of that Doctor (but probably closer to 70 or 80 I bet). 

Tennant did, what?  45 or so hour long episodes? (we havn't hit the fourth season yet)  So lets say 45 hours give or take.  I guess thats not too bad...but there is always room for more.

But heck, I say the same thing about Eccleston.  What was he thinking?  He should have stayed for a few years more at least.  I mean the Doctor is a cultural icon.  There are fans all over the world that are rabid enough to demand more episodes.  Its a paying acting gig that isn't likely to go away anytime soon.

Immigrants don't live in remote Scottish villages; they live in London and other major cities.  Why don't they live in remote Scottish villages?  Because there isn't much infrastructure there, perhaps.  Why isn't there infrastructure?  Because few people live there?  Why don't we try to get people to live there, so that the infrastructure will appear?  Because it doesn't work like that.  The infrastructure has to be built first, then the jobs will come, then the people.

You need to work out the actual, well for want of knowing the actual scientific nomenclature, fecundity of the land mass and how many people can be sustainably supported. And further to that, what quality of life you want beyond mere subsistence. That said, of course, the people who use this argument are usually using it to mask a basic racism because thankfully being racist is somewhat rude in British culture. After all, if that was their true belief they'd be arguing for population control for the extant population.
But, and here I go contradicting myself, there is a question about how the authorities handle immigration and its effect on communities. Communities do not consist of enlightened liberal rational agents, but limited prejudiced emotional agents who may have difficulty assimilating new cultural traits without discomfort and acquiring a threatening sense of the arbitrariness about their own. I'm not arguing that as a point of value, but rather as a pragmatic point. 
FYI I am British — my DNA has geographical origins amongst the Irish, English and possibly French; although, my name has a Germanic origin (go figure) — but I live in Japan, and have for nearly ten years. And I am not assimilated. It's an interesting position being the outsider in a society.
The chances of an intelligent debate about immigration and racism in the UK strike me as quite slim. Still, burning the gutter press would be a start.

It wasn't her suicide that did it. It was the story of her actions on Mars.

When the Doctor described the original timeline, he said she was motivated by the memory of her grandmother's memory, but that no one even knew what actually happened on Mars; they didn't know if it was a tragic accident or who-knows-what.

If you go back and read the BBC website pages they show for the crewmembers, the crewmembers that run off from the TARDIS tell their stories (including talking about the Doctor!), and Adelaide's story is this time known to everyone - everything she did, her heroism, etc etc. The timeline isn't really disrupted, and the granddaughter is this time motivated by her grandmother's heroism, not just her memory.

So really, by the end, the Doctor wasn't able to do _anything,_ and that's his crisis of conscience. He interfered.

I think that's what the writers tried to reinforce when they show that time healed it self and nothing actually changed over all, but from my point of view, I think the history would have changed in a huge way. 

Why did the captain go to space? because she was following the mystery of the Dalek.

Why was the granddaughter supposed to go into space? because she was following the mystery of the mars base, and her grandmother. 

Now there is no mystery. The two survivors tell the story, and the grandmother's body is found in her house. 

Second, say that time did end up fixing itself, and the granddaughter went into space anyway, and altering the fixed point didn't overall change anything... then what is the big deal about altering fixed points when it doesn't do any harm. The universe didn't tear open. The doctor didn't explode. Everything went on its merry way. 

Finally, there is the thing about moral choices. If there are no huge negative consequences from changing the timeline, then isn't it the moral duty for the doctor to save anyone he can? Especially since he has the power to do so while also being able to see the consequences?

""Free Derry Wall, compiled by Jim Collins and Adrian Kerr, provides a comprehensive record of Derry’s most famous icon over 40 years in words and images.
It was on the gable end of 33 Lecky Road, a small terraced house in Derry’s Bogside, that the hand-painted slogan ‘You Are Now Entering Free Derry’ was first scrawled in the early hours of 5 January 1969. It was born as a defiant message in the maelstrom of the civil rights struggle and went on to gain international recognition as a silent, but powerful, witness to tumultuous times.
For 40 years, the Wall has inspired much debate about what it stands for, what it should be used for, and what it actually means to people today in the aftermath of the decades of political upheaval and tentative peace. In order to explore and develop this debate, the book’s compilers – artist and activist Jim Collins and Museum of Free Derry manager Adrian Kerr – posed the question: “What does Free Derry Wall mean to you?”
The responses were many and varied from local residents, politicians, artists, activists, national figures and visitors to the city:
‘A potent symbol of a courageous people’
‘An elderly politician in the twilight of his years’
‘A megaphone of the people’
‘A voice to the dispossessed and marginalised’
‘A political advertising board’
‘Too meticulously trim … its paint like a Boss suit draped on proletarian shoulders’
To some, the Wall was a symbol for freedom, a political icon, community notice board or a public sculpture. To others, it was an anachronism, a vehicle for propaganda, a spent force or clichéd tourist attraction.
Free Derry Wall objectively presents these diverse unabridged viewpoints accompanied by a comprehensive pictorial record of the Wall and the numerous social, political and community issues highlighted on the reverse over four decades. Notable contributors include Bernadette McAliskey, Bill Rolston, Tony Benn, Eamonn McCann, Nell McCafferty, Dr Edward Daly, Bertie Ahern, Bairbre de Brún and Mark Durkan.""",0,1258662601,null,0,false,0,c0g0tam,t3_a65ra,t1_c0g0tam,t3_a65ra,null,1426102122,1,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,1

I know this report was spiced up to outrage people, but at the same time the government has pulled this trick a million times before; passing serious legislation to give MI5 powers against terrorists, then amending it without debate to extend the powers to local authorities against taxpayers.

You know this is going to end bad.  And end bad for three particular reasons:

1.  It will kill off what little entrepreneurship there is in this country; YouTube can just tell Mandleson to fuck off, or at least block UK access, a UK hosted alternative couldn't.

2.  It will kill off the Internet full-stop.  Now there's plenty who would cheer this, and even some other people who aren't called Murdoch, but can anyone seriously say that making the UK the odd-country-out with zero internet presence is a good idea?  This will make it nothing more than glorified television.  Can you imagine how this will harm: education, the economy, etc.; we'll be a joke who's only industry is hosting tourists who come here to laugh at us.

3.  Even if you accept the ridiculous powers it contains, they will still be abused.  I guarantee that if this becomes law, the powers will be used by big media to steal articles, photographs, etc. created by the little people.  And if the little people don't agree, they'll get the mob at their door.

This is a leap back several hundred years to an era where private organisations were granted state-sponsored monopolies.
