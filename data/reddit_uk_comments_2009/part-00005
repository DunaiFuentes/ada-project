I don’t know the details of this case but I can imagine that she was either incompetent or unwilling to look after the child when it was very sick, now social services have gotten involved and her defence against an abuse/neglect charge was ""Im not smart enough to do this properly"".

Social services answer was probably ""fine we'll do it then"".  At which point she suddenly grows a brain.

a.  No judge appoints a solicitor over the wishes of party without real need (Ever hear of this happening in any other case?)



b.  Social services don’t just snatch and adopt away children without warning or support (as Baby P and other cases have shown us, if anything they should air more on the side of taking children)

Would be downmodders and critics be warned: You have no grounding to accuse me of being some kind of authoritarian shill here, because I care deeply for our civil liberties and am in fact a member of Liberty (the group). However, saying that Britain is a police state - with the mental images of jackbooted thugs arresting dissidents, total media control, any hostile talk of the government or police resulting in prison, and networks of domestic spies - is both ludicrous and inaccurate. It is also damaging to genuine efforts to curtail the overzealousness of the situation. Instead of simply saying ""POLICE STATE!"" and jacking off to the thought, you should instead be doing something helpful. And saying this doesn't give you the right to leap on me saying I ""don't get it"". If Britain was a police state, why would the police both investigate the Conservatives upon suspicion of a leak yet also investigate the ruling Labour party for the Cash-for-Peerages scandal? Why would I - or anyone at Liberty, or the Guardian say - be able to type this without instantly tripping an alarm in an office somewhere for brownshirts to beat down my door five minutes from now? Why would anyone be even remotely critical of the police or the government, if they thought it would all be seen and heard?

I'm not blind. I know we have a problem, most notably with the policing system mired as it is in bureaucracy and the network of (mostly private) cameras everywhere. But those police, for all the ""us-vs-them"" attitude that may indeed be present (and to varying degrees) are not following a shadowy conspiracy to crack all of our skulls. Those cameras are not all linked to a single network that watches you all the time. And Britain is not a police state.

This band of brothers (England, Scotland and Wales) became best of friends over time and did all sorts of cool shit with swords so people began to call them ""Great Britain"".

Is this a divisive move by our government? Pitching the haves against the have-nots?

You see, if we (the 'haves') disagree with the legislation, it will be easy for the government to argue that we are halting the deployment of a free internet to those who don't currently have it.

I am all for the nationwide deployment of broadband internet access, but not at the expense of network neutrality.

This has been turned from a technological challenge into a political situation. Where do we go from here?

It is. '*The beginning of the end*'?

&gt;Some nutter judge feels that having a jury is too much of a pain (to expensive and to much of a burden on the jury members were his reason)

No, **Lord Judge** has ruled that the trial having **re-started three times already**, shows that the **dangers** of **tampering and threatening of the jury** members, will be both a mental **burden on the jury**, and public financial burden because he wants **to adequately protect them and their families**.


&gt;So he has just appointed himself.

No, Lord Judge has, within his role as **Lord Chief Justice** sitting with two other judges in **the Court of Appeal**, said it will be fine for a single judge to rule over a case, rather then throw it out 

(And just for completion - 
&gt;Next week: Gordon brown to continue democratic government without any further elections.


Yes. As he's allowed to do, what with the democratic vote taken less then five years ago allowing Labour to rule for up to five years. Might suck, but the rules don't say he has to listen to when we want to vote. At least we get a vote, a vote which is both counted properly and can change things).

The lifespan of a military naval vessel is about 50 years. If our navy only compromised of 20 ships that would mean you have to put a new one in the water every 2 to 3 years. You can't simply re-fit the recently made trident submarines because the subs that we put in commision 50 years ago are coming out of the water.

Now don't you think adequate defense is a good idea. Especially in a time where a militant communist state is quickly becoming one of the strongest industrial powers in the world. Where numerous developed nations are revolting (Iran/Honduras/Iraq). Where Pakistan doesn't know whether it wants to be a democracy or be influenced by tribal islam. Where the after effects of the fall of the soviets is still effects eastern europe (Balkans wars/Kosovo/Bosnia).

Now I'm not some nut who thinks the arabs are coming. In fact I don't think the UK has any immediate threats, most of western Europe all see each other at eye level. The problems come with how fast an army can take and defend land against an unprepared target. It took mere days for western forces to occupy the capitals of Iraq/Afghanistan. I don't intend to needlessly invoke Godwins Law, but Hitler conquered half of europe in year and if it wasn't for the intervention of America we'd probably all live in communist states (or worse still the ashes of).

So again, I really would like to live in a world free of poverty, disease and violence but sadly it's just a dream.
