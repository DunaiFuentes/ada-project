If Ireland vote 'no', they'll only be asked again until they 'understand' it better. Of course, if they vote 'yes', they're not going to be asked again next year in case they're changed their minds!

But consider, Ireland - generally regarded as pro-EU nation - was first very happy to take loads of EU development money and, off the back of it, turn themselves into the 'Celtic Tiger'. Then they decided they were doing great and weren't that keen on EU integration after all and voted No. But now, with the credit crunch(*), recession and unemployment, isn't it funny how Ireland now seems to be about to decide that the EU is a good thing after all!

(*) As an aside, I found out recently from the [BBC Love of Money](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00mq36b) series, that on the day when Ireland decided to provide 100% backing to its banks, it only told the EU finance minister that morning and said nothing to any of the other countries...

The reason is that your vote is a signal that you are supporting the policies espoused by a party. So, even if lib-dems are unlikely to win, but assuming they get their vote share increased significantly, the party in power knows that lib dem policies have become more popular. Which would be a consideration in how they prioritise the policies to implement.

So, in my way of thinking, there is no wasted vote - it is just a fiction propagated by the established front-runners since it makes things easier for them.

I would also apply similar reasoning to argue that voting is always better than abstaining, unless there is not a single policy on any party's agenda that you like.

The first and easiest thing I'd do is add www.libdemvoice.org to your reading list, to keep up with what's going on. There's a members-only forum there too that you can get access to once you get your membership number.

The second thing is to get onto your constituency mailing list - google around for lib dems + name of your area and I'm sure you'll find something.

In the run-up to the election there are bound to be a lot of leaflets to be delivered (it takes ~250,000 leaflets for us to win a seat!) and stuffed into envelopes and so on - I deliver leaflets on foot in a couple of streets near my house, it takes about an hour every couple of months, so really not a huge commitment.

Finally, talk to people! Talk to your friends and family and ask them what they think of lib dem policies - not in an aggressive way, just if it comes up - and help normalize the idea that the LDs are a big serious party - which they are.

Bear in mind that Brown didn't even suggest a referendum on AV+, the PR system specifically advocated by Labour's own Jenkins Report into electoral reform. AV+ would at least have a system of top-up MPs to make things more proportional - it's what they use in Scotland IIRC - although the party list system means that MPs no-one likes can still get elected on the top-up list.

However, it's clear to anyone with a brain, I think, that multi-member STV is the only sensible choice for the UK - basically, make every constituency five times bigger and have 5 MPs in each, voters vote in order of preference for individuals on the ballot paper, and the top 5 after everyone else's second, third, etc, place votes have been redistributed win seats.

Multi-member STV maintains the constituency link so that voters have nominated representatives that they can contact directly - in fact, better than now they can actually approach an MP of a stripe closer to their own instead of being stuck with one from another party - because it is non-party-list based it means that individuals in a party who are incompetent/fraudulent/stupid/liars can be voted against *while still maintaining support for the party*.

Well said. The labels of left and right are completely out-dated and bare no resemblance to policy. The 'far-right' BNP is perhaps the best example of this. From the manifesto:

-renationalise monopoly utilities

-increase taxes on corporations who off-shore jobs

-pay for the training of doctors and nurses

-abolish tuition fees in 'proper' subjects

-take all privatised social housing stock back under council control

They have to keep aside reserves to cover this or be in breach of reserve rules.

But we're not talkng about banks whose mortgages are *all* 100%. They're mixed in with 90%, 80%, 50% etc - partly because that is how the mortgages were arranged, partly because mortgages get paid off.

The essential requirement is that (most of) the mortgagees keep paying up.

At the heart of the sub-prime crisis were an entire sector of mortgagees who couldn't pay - not even when times were good. Mortgage agents got their commission on signing - they had no interest in whether the signers ever made a single payment.

In a sane world, the mortgaging companies would have dropped such agents like a hot stone, but those companies had their risks insured - so they didn't care either. Their book value relied on volume, not quality.

In a sane world the insurers would have hammered such companies with prohibitive premiums - but the insurers were bundling these risks in sophisticated swaps, so they didn't care either.

Those swaps were traded (and re-insured), long past the point where anyone knew or cared what flimsy foundations the whole edifice teeterred on.

There's blame to be shared out, from top to bottom, but these irresponsible operators would probably have got away with it all, if only the initial agents had made some rudimentary checks on the income of mortgage-holders.

The 'credit squeeze' was never about any real shortage of money (most of the money was a fantasy, anyway), it was about the panic which set in, when the financial world realised that there was a real hole in their elaborate fantasy - and, what's worse, they hadn't a clue where it was, precisely.",0,1255263004,null,0,true,0,c0eae9h,t3_9sdyl,t1_c0eae9h,t1_c0e9ag7,null,1426070112,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Until recently I nursed a secret hope that somehow the Lib Dems might make huge strides at the expense of Labour (there was a point a while ago towards the end of the Iraq war where Labour were looking decidedly ropey), if only because they've never *had* enough power to become corrupted by special interest groups, and seem to lack the internal cohesion necessary to pull the kind of shit Labour (or the Republicans, in the US) were capable of doing.

Alas, (surprise!) the Lib Dems lacked the power and the internal cohesion to even make much of Labour's political troubles, let alone become serious contenders, so I guess the next election is another ""wasted"" vote for the Lib Dems, in the vain hope that enough people slowly get disenfranchised with the other two parties to come around to the idea of giving them a go.
