true,SLAUTCAANS,null,null,"Most of the rich operate through non-profit trusts that then owns their assets.  The owned assets are then rented to corporations under it and so the money flows into the non-profit trust above it and it is untaxable.

Only some taxes are unavoidable, but that is down to just a few percent.

This is how the most wealthy families operate.

The trust is established for the family, so when one older member dies and new family members are born, they are removed from and added to the trust respectively and no inheritance tax is ever paid, as the trust is always the owner, and the family line is the beneficiary of the trust.  They either may be the trustees themselves or they may employ someone as a trustee.

As such, the family can show that they earn very little money and stay under the radar of the super rich list, whereas in reality their wealth is all held in the trust - non-profit *corporate-entity*.

As long as they keep the books balanced in each country where an account is registered as a *not-for-profit*, they are both protected by the trust and pay little total tax.

My wife is a Russian national, and like myself, settled in Germany. We both have jobs and have houses in the UK and Germany, our daughter (also a Russian citizen), wanted to take her Erasmus placement at a UK university.

Our experiences were that visa processing had been outsourced to an American company, CSC who gave false information over the telephone, required payments (in Germany) in dollars rather than Euros or Sterling and when the interviews took place, they were staffed with Eastern Europeans who could not speak either English or German. In my daughter's case, they insisted on issuing the incorrect visa (luckily caught by consular staff later) and in my wife's they were outright rude because they had difficulties collecting her fingerprints (10 attempts). I have a laptop with fingerprint verification, it had no problems so it is possible that CSC staff were failing to maintain the equipment.

My wife has been to the UK on many occasions before.

That's the funniest thing I've heard all year.

Actually, people downvoted me the other day, when I said that British culture was shallow, low quality, and a poor patchwork of parts of the cultures of others.

This land is bad. It is a bad place to live, it is a bad place to work. We have a bad political system, and we have bad (and lazy, and thick, and selfish, and ugly, and hedonistic) people. Why we have thousands of people coming here a day I will never know, because I've seen a lot of it and been to a lot of it, and the more I stay here the more I feel like anyone with any smarts is looking at moving somewhere better. I know that's what I'm doing.

Deep fried mars bars are pocket sized heart attacks, and we're a culinary laughing stock for having that as the best we have to offer. Doner kebabs are scraped off the cutting room floor and most likely spat on by whoever is serving to you, and are again pocket sized heart attacks. Girls who wear mini-skirts in sub-zero temperatures look like slags, and they and their equally trash boyfriends turn town centres into a warzone every single night. The NHS couldn't cure a spot with a brown paper bag. The BBC is that embarrassing aunt who dances weirdly and tells bad stories at your party. Radio 4 is boring on a quantum level. Chicken Tikka Masala is an indian food. The Beatles suck. The rain sucks. The Notting Hill Festival sucks. The shitty train service sucks. Queueing REALLY sucks. The London Olympics is going to suck. 

But most importantly of all - the single most revolting thing about this rotten cancer of a country - is the British people. If you are honestly prepared to tell me that they, those filthy, loathesome parasites, are not the most sucky things that ever sucked, then you need your head testing. I hate being British.

Dear Sirs,

It has come to my attention that a tourist recently ran into trouble with the Metropolitan Police, I quote from The Guardian as follows:

&gt; Like most visitors to London, Klaus Matzka and his teenage son Loris took several photographs of some of the city's sights, including the famous red double-decker buses. More unusually perhaps, they also took pictures of the Vauxhall bus station, which Matzka regards as ""modern sculpture"".
But the tourists have said they had to return home to Vienna without their holiday pictures after two policemen forced them to delete the photographs from their cameras in the name of preventing terrorism.
[guardian.co.uk,	 Thursday 16 April 2009 12.53 BST]

I am planning a trip to London for exactly the same purpose: that of obtaining photographs both of red London buses, and bus stations.

I therefore request clarification, under the terms of the Freedom of Information Act, concerning the recent legislation regarding the taking of photographs in public places and specifically regarding the instruction of Police Officers in the enforcement of this new Law.

I shall delay my trip until such time as I have in possession a properly signed Home Office document stating clearly what the position is.


Yours sincerely,

Charlie Dancey

Reference:  T6672/9  FOI ref 11814



Dear Mr Dancey,

Thank you for your e-mail dated 17/04/2009 7:10:08 AM in which you ask for clarification, concerning recent legislation regarding the taking of photographs in public places and specifically regarding the instruction of Police Officers in the enforcement of this new law.I am pleased to be able to disclose the information that you requested to you.
 
There are two issues that have been the subject of recent media attention regarding photography in public. 
First concerns have been expressed about the stop and search powers under section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000. Section 44 enables the police to stop and search anyone within an authorised area for the purposes of searching for articles of a kind that could be used in connection with terrorism. The powers do not require a reasonable suspicion that such articles exist. This is a useful power but it is also a very wide ranging one and concerns have been raised that the power is being used to stop people taking photographs within authorised areas – whether this is photographs of buildings or people – and that cameras are being confiscated and images deleted as part of such searches. 

I would like to be absolutely clear, that section 44 does not prohibit the taking of photographs.  The National Policing Improvement Agency issued revised guidance on the use of section 44 in November last year which made it clear that the power does not stop the taking of photographs in an authorised area and that the police should not prevent people from taking pictures using these powers. The police may, of course, stop and search someone who is taking photographs within an authorised area just as they may stop and search any member of the public but the powers should not be targeted at photographers.  

In the case you highlight involving a member of the public being asked to delete images the guidance issued to police states the following;
‘officers do not have a legal power to delete images or destroy film. Although images may be viewed as part of a search, to preserve evidence when cameras or other devices are seized, officers should not normally attempt to examine them.’    

The second issue concerns the new offence at section 58A of the Terrorism Act 2000 which was inserted by section 76 of the Counter-Terrorism Act 2008. This makes it an offence to elicit, or attempt to elicit, or publish or communicate information about an individual who is, or has been, a constable or a member of the armed forces or intelligences services. The information must be of a kind that is likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing acts of terrorism.

It has been suggested that this new offence could criminalise people taking or publishing photographs of police officers. Whilst a photograph of a police officer may potentially fall within the scope of this offence it might only do so in a very limited set of circumstances. This offence is designed to capture terrorist targeting activity directed at members of the protected groups – which sadly we know does occur. The offence might, therefore, be committed where someone provides a person with information about the names and addresses and details of car registration numbers of persons in the protected groups. The important thing here is that the photographs would have to be of a kind which are likely to provide practical assistance to terrorists – and the person taking or providing the photograph would have to have no reasonable excuse for doing so such as responsible journalism.

Therefore the offence would not – capture an innocent tourist taking a photograph of a police officer, or a journalist photographing police officers as part of his or her job. It does not criminalise the normal taking of photographs of the police. Police officers do have the discretion to ask people not to take photographs for public safety or security reasons but the taking of photographs in a public place is not subject to any rules or statute. There are no legal restrictions on photography in a public place and there is no presumption of privacy for individuals in a public place. 

The Home Office is in the process of drafting a circular to all police forces on the new offence setting out the policy intentions behind it and making clear that it does not criminalise legitimate photographic or journalistic activity. This circular will be discussed with interested parties before it is issued.

It is worth noting in this context that there are two safeguards built into the statute. First, all prosecutions for the offence must be approved by the Director of Public Prosecutions and second, it is a defence for a person to prove that they had a reasonable excuse for their actions.

true,[deleted],null,null,"""This was clearly appalling on several counts. First, there were no massacres or state terrorism by Israel in Gaza. There was a war against terrorism. The terrorism is being perpetrated by Gaza against Israel. Loach does not seek to boycott those who deliberately try to murder Israeli innocents; he supports them and tries to punish their victims instead. Second this film director, whose business should surely be to promote free artistic and cultural expression, was trying to stifle and censor a film. Third, he was attempting to penalise someone who had no responsibility whatever for Israeli policy, simply because she was an Israeli citizen. Lies, suppression and injustice – that’s what Ken Loach has now shown he stands for.""

The first point is laughable

The second point is nonsense as Loach does not object to the film or its creator, he objects to the Israeli funding.  Also, since Palestinians are not permitted to leave Israel (or the occupied territories as everyone else calls them) it is Israel not Loach who are stifling free artistic and cultural expression

Third, every Israeli has responsibility for Israeli policy since it is a democracy and (Jews at least) can vote to change it.  When South Africa practiced apartheid we boycotted their goods without considering whether individual producers were pro or anti apartheid.  Also at the top of the article the author is quite clear that it is ""Gaza"" perpetrating terrorism, not Hamas or certain Gazans but the whole of Gaza.  Its seems pretty hypocritical to then turn around and say that you can blame an Israeli for Israeli policy.

I hope that this film is shown and does win an award but Loach is right to say that the awards should not accept funding (even just £300) from an Apartheid regime.  We would not have had it from S.A. and we should not tolerate it from Israel.

Still what do we expect for the spectator.  Its like Fox new for the over paid.

Speaking Latin isn't a particularly useful skill these days, but like mental arithmetic, it's still something that most educated people could do back then that most educated people today can't do nearly as well, if at all.

Seriously:  I've been in a shop and watched a girl - slowly - have to use a calculator to subtract 25 from 100.  Then she did it again to check.  (Her till was down).  I do not believe someone with mental arithmetic skills that poor would have ever got a job in retail fifty years ago.

Now with maths, calculators obviously allow us to do different types of mathematics more quickly than our abacus-wielding cave-ancestors did.  But take a specific field of mathematics by itself - calculus, for example - and see at what age schoolchildren did this in 1920, 1960, 1980 or 2,000.

true,G_Morgan,cnty-wales,Wales,"GCSEs are designed to assure people the gap between the best and the rest isn't that large. The whole purpose of the tier system was that the higher tier was essentially equivalent to the old O-Levels while the lower tier was for everyone else.

A top grade (75% IIRC) on the lower tier would be a C while the lowest pass on the higher tier (roughly 30%) was also a C. Despite this teachers would tell anyone only interested in getting their C to take the lower tier paper. It may as well have been a different qualification it was so much more easier. Having sat the higher tier but read many lower tier papers I'd guess that a lower tier C was in fact 2 grades beneath the higher tier C.

Then there is the A*. A grade which is designed to give the impression of being slightly better than an A. It is meant to draw comparisons to the A+ grades you might see on homework. It is statistically 2.5 grades more difficult than the A. There are A passes that just scraped in and then there are A passes that would have been two grades higher had the system been set up to fairly reflect ability rather than serve some political agenda.

Finally on the maths paper until recently they actually had 3 tiers so they can hide even more diversity.

In any case. The point of all this is they still teach the same sort of content but use statistical manipulation, rather than actually reducing what is on the paper, to make it look as if pass rates are getting higher. I'd ignore the '50% of people get an A grade' statistics. It is a worthless measure given the vast gap between it and the next grade up.

In any case 95% of people would not have done calculus at all in past years. Even then it would not have been the ability to do mental maths that would separate the good from the bad. Calculus is about representing problems in an algebraic manner and transforming them to tell us useful information about the problem. It is something that requires thought and understanding rather than the ability to do quick maths.

Just move your new family members into the beneficiary list and the trustees to be handled in-family or by someone you trust.

No inheritance occurs as the trust remains ownership throughout.

But absolutely make sure everything is balanced in the accounts and according to the commercial codes / rules / regulations etc.

This is how the Rockefellers and Rothschilds maintain their wealth and also how the IKEA family pay little tax (as they operate behind their non-profit Trust that owns everything) and also how Howard Hughes kept his great wealth. - It is said he died in ""poverty"", but he was the Trustee and the Beneficiary of his Trust that owned everything.

Regardless on whether the act is important or not, reforming an act with this name would be impossible to do without the party that changes it taking a huge blow. Just saying ""We want to get rid of the Human Rights Act!"" is dangerous, because no one wants their human rights taken away, even if we don't know what those rights are. I'm sure that most people don't have the will power, or the time, to look up the law for themselves.

This is another example of why a democracy is faulty; it relies too much on the opinions of laymen who don't understand fully what their views mean, and so their votes can be dangerous without them even knowing it.

In this example, without people doing research into why Labour and Conservatives criticise this law, people are going to be scared of losing their civil liberties (are those covered by this act? I don't know) and immediately vote against any changes to it (by that I mean voting for Lib Dems). Lets say for a second that the Human Rights Act is actually a terrible set of laws, badly written with loops holes and all manor of terrible things. Because of the voters' ignorance that law could stick around for a long time with many people being harmed by it unjustly, and no one can change it.

Social Services will often offer better working wages to any solicitor contesting their cases. But in any case there is often a background in the department of certain higher ups taking bungs, cash payments, for children to be forcefully adopted by smearing and or falsey representing the parent. Afterall they will pick the family the child goes too...

In Legal circles called ""Breaking the Case"" And solicitors do it this way because they can put in a claim for the whole case from central funds, even work inherited from previous firms... And this they get huge payouts with zero effort.
