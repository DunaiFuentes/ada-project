In many ways, we are extremely privileged no matter what our level of intellect is.

On the other hand, I don't like this ""anti-intellectual"" movement that seems to be constantly going on in the UK. I work my ass off to learn as much as I can in life, without someone ridiculing me for it.

Some people's goals in life are to be ""happy"". But some people, when they see the problems of the world around them, can't be happy without at least feeling that they've made some kind of contribution, some kind of boost to the system they've taken so much from.

Perhaps in small stores that don't have barcode scanners, but not in the kind of supermarket mentioned in the article.  Your till would be out at the end of the shift.  Not to mention the fact that it's common practice to disallow anyone who is handling money from carrying any money of their own.  So if they've got pound coins jangling around in their pockets (assuming their company-provided uniforms have pockets) then they're not going to last long before being rumbled.

True story (or so I was led to believe): a long time ago I knew a guy who worked in an amusement park.  A colleague of his was responsible for emptying all the cash drawers from the various machines - things like the hooky-grab-a-toy-and-drop-it-in-the-chute machines.  His uniform had no pockets and he was subject to regular spot-checks to make sure he was clean (things like checking his shoes, getting him to jump up and down to listen for jingling coins and so on).  Legend has it that he would stuff money into one of the cuddly toys in a particular machine, finish his shift, then re-enter the park as a ""civilian"" and play the machine until he hooked the loot-stuffed bear.  

It wasn't uncommon to find bit of dismembered teddy lying around the floor of the local pub.

true,dave_L,null,null,"This McKinnon case does baffles me &amp; i think it's not as simple as everyone think it is. Gary McKinnon must have fished out something *controversially explosive* from the US Government 's (or even the White House communication logs, etc) databases; Or super secret ordnance/weapon systems' trial results; Or the way McKinnon's highly unusual ability in decrypting cyphers (ala-Rainman, the movie).

Also, UK Government's refusal to touch this matter on behalf of its own citizen only point to something akin to *quid-pro-quo* handling. Maybe Bush's administration then had done a previously *very very* special favor for Blair in which the succeeding British bureaucrats had no choice but to trade McKinnon for the previous decisions made by Bush government.

If so, is it related to Israel-Hamas matter? Iraq or Afghan War? Assassination of Lebanon's Hariri? Or probably the cause of Financial Crisis &amp; Monetary matters?
