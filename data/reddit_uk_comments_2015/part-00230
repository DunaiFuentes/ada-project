To get it out of the way, yes the extremist imams are genuine ISIS supporters with a political agenda.  The question is how they are able to gain such a large impact in their local communities despite preaching values that go against everything that we stand for. The fact these communities happen to be places that are historically ignored by government and thus are rather impoverished is no coincidence - where there are high levels of wealth inequality, radical ideas flourish. That's why we don't see radicalism amongst British Muslims who are from wealthy/privileged backgrounds. That's why EDL members tend to mainly consist of uneducated, unemployed people. The most dangerous kind of the person is the one who feels they have nothing to lose, and an opportunity to strike out to gain.

Getting rid of the radical preachers isn't going to solve the problem, they have a influence on the community, and any move against them will give the ammunition to say ""See, your Western government wishes to oppress and silence Muslims, you must join in the revolution"". The Streisand effect is powerful. And that is what Lady Warsi is alluding to here.

I think the only real way to deal with these radical preachers is to disarm their words. If the radical preachers' narrative that the West is trying to oppress and marginalise Muslims doesn't translate into the perceived reality of the people they are preaching to, then their reaching will fall on deaf ears. That's the sense in which government engagement with the Muslim communities is necessary - we need to understand the living conditions that are pushing people towards radicalisation.",null,0,null,1434557947,null,0,1434558383,0,cs9ok5y,null,t3_3a1eyr,null,t1_cs9ok5y,null,t1_cs8oxtt,null,null,null,1437140756,null,1,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,1,null

Still, we drank in honor of all who participated and had a lovely, quiet respite on a chilly day, and the regulars in the other corner never paused in the lively conversation of whatever it was (horse racing? women? woman racing?), nor did we hear one cell phone go off, a TV, or a braying laugh.

2. Morality does not change from year to year depending on what is ""normal"" in the society around you. Killing Jews in 1930s Germany was wrong in the 1940s even though it was very common. Lynching black people in the 1950s south likewise. And yes, the rape of prepubescent children was wrong in the 700s.

(I will assume they have made Wills. If not, let me know and I'll details the problems around Intestacy.) Rather than leaving their estate to your parents, they could consider leaving the money either directly to their grandchildren, or to a trust. The reason for this is the £500k will simply add to your parents' estate, and potentially cause an Inheritance Tax bill on your parents' death. As your parents appear financially stable, skipping a generation would avoid this issue.

If your grandparents would like your parents to retain control of the money, leaving their estate via a trust would be the sensible route, rather than a straight legacy to the grandchildren. Your parents would be trustees and the potential beneficiaries could include all of your family members (including your parents), so monies could be granted to those beneficiaries at the trustees' discretion. There may be Inheritance Tax charges on the set up and ongoing running of the trust, so competent financial advice would be required - so visit an IHT qualified solicitor rather than a Will writer.

In terms of what to do with the inheritance from an investment perspective, it's really too early to say.

I think those cases a much, much complicated affair, and I don't think I'm really qualified to comment. What I do know is that I have a couple of Muslim associates on my facebook feed, who are very well educated, and fairly-left-wing (I don't think there is any concern of them defecting to ISIS any time soon) getting caught up with all the crap being shared around on Facebook in their local community. Like usually they will post about genuine Islamophobic incidents (such as the British woman who got attacked for wearing a Hijab, and the United Airlines incident), but occasionally they will caught up in believing out of context videos claiming to be evidence of a conspiracy (for example, claims that ISIS is a false flag by the CIA to discredit Muslims, as shown by a YouTube video which shows a group of ISIS fighters praying whilst facing in different directions, when every Muslim knows to pray towards Mecca - personally, I think the more reasonable explanation for what is seen in the video is that given ISIS fighters misunderstood that Jihad is meant as a collective self-defence principle rather than a license to kill indiscriminately, I don't think ISIS fighters are exactly very good at following the tenets of Islam..).

If otherwise reasonable Muslims get caught up in the propaganda conspiracies, I could imagine a more naive yet politically active Muslim being tricked into thinking that the West has already gone into full on Nazi death camp against Muslims mode...

It's a very complex situation, and the only thing for certain is that ISIS and radical preachers are very effective with their propaganda campaigns..

null,false,DaBa1Dee,cnty-wales,Not Welsh but live here,null,"Graduated in 2012 with a 2:1 in History.

Ended up with a series of temp jobs after moving back home, including cold-calling for a double-glazing firm, which was torture full stop. Unfortunately, I ended up on the dole for three months. The Jobcentre didn't help me find work: all I did was turn up once a fortnight, hand in my job search booklet, and was sent on my merry way.

I then worked in a call centre for a high-street bank, and although my manager was great, I couldn't stand it. That lead into my current job: a trainee sub-editor for a newspaper (not naming it). I moved to Wales for that job. Isn't perfect by any means but is a foot in the door of the newspaper industry. I'm looking at moving into production design too.

In fact, are there any history graduates here who had trouble finding work after Uni? From what I've heard, because history is a degree which doesn't lend itself to any particular profession I've read all sorts of horror stories about history graduates working in minimum-wage jobs.

Certainly, I've wondered why I went to uni and didn't learn a trade instead. We've all been taught that we should go to uni to avoid ending up in crappy jobs, but instead, we've been told we're overqualified for most low-skilled jobs upon graduation. I've often wondered why I didn't do something else at uni which I would have enjoyed less, but instead lead to better career prospects (e.g. Law).

Cliché, but it's true - you couldn't touch him. 

Unfortunately he's just never progressed from then. It's a real shame, and it might be due to attitude, or maybe something more sinister. I mean, nobody gets to become a professional footballer with 30+ caps for Italy without working hard during their career. I'm not sure I've ever wanted a new signing to work out more than Balotelli.

If Jose says he doesn't want Arsenal to have Cech you can bet your ass he's going to do everything in his power to stop Arsenal from getting him. Roman obviously has the authority to do what he wants, but I get the feeling that with the inclusion of Marina on the board now, Roman is a lot less involved in club matter than he was 5-6 years ago. But that's not to say he won't chip his opinion in about the matter, and he certainly isn't going to do something out of pure sentiment.

I think right now Chelsea (that includes both Roman and Jose) are waiting for an irresistible offer, and what Arsene is trying to do is low-ball his way into signing Cech, as he tries to do with virtually every player he becomes interested in. But Cech is a world-class goalkeeper, I'd say top 5 in the world easily, so for Chelsea to just let Cech leave to wherever he wants isn't as simple as letting Lampard do that. Moreover, I don't think Cech should be demanding a move to Arsenal after all the years he's spent with us, as it puts us in a position of weakness on the negotiating table. 

But to answer your question, Mourinho can't do anything if Roman decides to sell Cech to Arsenal.

A couple of years ago a soldier was beheaded on the streets of London. 

It's so much easier to mumble ""it's ignorance"" or ""we need more education"". You can't change the simple fact that many, many incidents of terrorism to people of this country have been committed by Islamists. What you're seeing is public opinion react to the terror attacks, react to the fear instilled by the threat of blowing up buses and the tube.

Anyway, both bikes are great fun to ride, very similar in most respects except for the engine (3 v 4 cylinder). 

Dislikes: Whilst I found the Honda to be a solid bike and very reliable I feel that they are definitely made with cost in mind. The instrument cluster was quite tacky loosely fitted, even after tightening the fasteners the separate parts still vibrated at certain RPM's which would be a little irritating.

Many of the fasteners and black parts (Horn, brake lines) formed white... oxidisation(?) over them and gave the bike a very tatty look unless you meticulously clean them. 

Foot brake pedal, gear selector and the mirror bolts formed nasty surface rust that I couldn't remove.

The lower headstock part (sorry don't know the name of it - joins the forks together!) was rusting nastily and the paint was peeling. 

Not much room for a pillion on either bike, but the Hornet probably has a bigger perch. 

The hornet has a very basic dash/computer(?) compared to the Striple (on the FA9 anyway!). The Striple has a very good system with tyre pressure monitoring (an extra), gear indicator, rev lights (gimmick), mpg readout on the A/B trip. 

Since I have only had the Striple for a short time I can't fault it. One issue I do have is moving off in first gear, it really doesn't like slow starts, seems juddery. Looks and sounds *amazing* though.

He’s only 19 so it’s obviously too early to really make a judgement, but I think he has a bright future ahead of him. If he plays as well this upcoming season as he did last season, I wouldn’t be surprised if he makes a move to either one of Portugal’s big three or abroad. Leading this team in the u20 is surely going to lead to some bids this summer though. 

With that said, I think he will have much more success in Italy than in the prem. Not saying he wouldn’t fit in England, but I don’t think it’s the ideal league for him. At least not yet.

Now, O2 is slightly less bad than it used to be in my area, possible because of Three.

I've waited seven years for O2 to introduce 3G near me, even switched to Orange for a few years because I was sick of waiting.  
Now after a few days of engineering work the other week, O2 suddenly have 4G and 3G, and I only lose signal indoors about a quarter of the time, instead of half the time.

Orange/EE might have the best coverage nationally, but around me it wasn't great; and I had several occasions – even in populous towns – when texts sent to me never got delivered, and when the network was too busy for me to get on it and make a call.  
Their network had an alarming tendency to let me down when I really needed to use it. And their customer service was hard work.

O2 on the other hand have always had useful and helpful people whenever I've called them, even when their coverage wasn't great.

Lucas' first thought is to defend and his passes, I assume are mainly to the midfielders right in front or beside him, or defenders behind him, whereas Gerrard looks to find the wingers/wing backs in attacking positions, or strikers running in behind - The Hollywood Ball, as you said.

I think Can may be a step up defensively on Gerrard (of last year), but a step down on Lucas. I also think he's a step down attacking/creatively from Gerrard, but a step up from Lucas. He's the middle of both.

**Four out of 10 British Muslims want sharia law introduced into parts of the country, a survey reveals today.**

So 40%, according to a survey, want it introduced into parts of the country - possibly the parts that aren't already served by Shariah courts for some civil and ceremonial matters, to cater to the muslims there? Similarly to how jews use Beth Din.

&gt; 25% of British Muslims say that 7.7 bombings were justified.

Not according to your source.

**The ICM opinion poll also indicates that a fifth** (that's not 25% anyway, but it's sort of irrelevant as we shall see) **have sympathy with the ""feelings and motives"" of the suicide bombers... although 99 per cent thought the bombers were wrong to carry out the atrocity.**

So the article paints a complex picture, but much different to your little sketch. 99% said the bombings were wrong, yet you've weaseled it down to, at most, 75% with a couple of very cheap tricks.

**Overall, the findings depict a Muslim community becoming more radical and feeling more alienated from mainstream society, even though 91 per cent still say they feel loyal to Britain.**

If you're credulous of all these stats, that 91% must be quite encouraging.

The following would normally be considered too specific, note that it is because they are technically irrelevant to gender, and therefore ""politically suspicious"":

e.g.

-""*Muslim* man murdered in London""

-""*White* woman murdered in London""

-""*Gay* man murdered in London""

-""*Immigrant* woman murdered in London""

i think that a lot of it is how you frame your request ie didn't just say we wanted a holiday (which would have been true haha), wrote to them to explain about it being an educational opportunity in itself, chance to mix with different cultures from across europe and see a different way of life, any school work he misses we will take with us and ensure he keeps up with homework etc etc etc.  

he's a couple years older now so doubt it would work as he prepares to leave junior school but that was our experience.  of course if we'd been turned down we wouldn't have got butt hurt about it (not saying you are, OP!) but just shrugged and gone the head is just following the rules given to her whether she agrees or not.

I expect not and that is why this is terrible advice and should not be listened to. It seems as though you have read one coherent source, which is a blog post, and then decided that you know what you're talking about (which you don't).

There are two things that you're wrong on:
1. The first is your assumption that a higher expected return is better than a lower one. That is not necessarily the case because you haven't taken into account risk. An investment that is expected to return 7% may be twice as likely to fall as an investment that returns 4%, and in that case the 4% return is better because you're less likely to lose money than you are to gain.
2. You assume that a mix of managed funds is a clever way to invest but you're not taking into account the relevant performance of managers, which often is below the market, though you tenuously take into account fees. A far better way to invest would be to do so through Vanguard's ETFs, which anyone can access for 25bps through Vanguard, or if you have £100k + you are able to go to Vanguard directly.

Reading blog posts on finance is a great way to get into finance but it is not sufficient to become an advisor on the subject (or to claim to be).

There is a reason that the sidebar has the Important Info section on the side, which says that the individuals here are ""not qualified"". The advice is meant with a good heart but be wary of it.

u/CitizendAreAlarmed has missed out risk from his advice, which essentially means that he's told you to put your money on a roulette wheel and cover all numbers but 0, 1 and 2 which will get you statistically similar returns to his advice but in a shorter time period. There is good advice on accounting for inflation when assessing the return you want but understanding risk/return is more important.

u/UncleArthur and u/Euan_whos_army have focused on minimising tax, which will not apply to a £500k estate that is co-owned by a couple (each relative has £325k tax free). However, UA's advice on minimising the tax burden for your parents estate is sound but not time pressing, contingent on your parents deciding to pass on their wealth that exceeds £650k esatate to you (and others) 7 years before they die.

With this sort of money go to a financial advisor and pay the £3k fees that will be required to provide genuine tuition on investment. This will limit your chances of making costly mistakes, like you will do if you follow the advice from the reddit personal finance users.

Other options are to:
a. Invest in to a diversified portfolio of liquid assets such as the Vanguard tracker ETFs (ie FTSE 100 or FTSE all share), and then another portion in bonds and cash. The issue with this is that you must personally balance risk (of high equity exposure, low bond yield) and return, without experience this is difficult.
b. Invest in property, which can return c.5% per year through a buy to let.
c. Invest in your eduction (if you are young which I take it you are). Building skills has the highest return of investments for the individual. If you can use this to pay for a degree in finance, or an MBA at a top school then this could be well worth it.",null,0,null,1434570087,null,0,false,0,cs9wgo0,null,t3_3a65eh,null,t1_cs9wgo0,null,t3_3a65eh,null,null,null,1437146801,null,6,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,6,null

I'm not opposed to it by any means.  I'm all for free economy etc and it's a mutually beneficial transaction for both parties. Goods and devices being exchanged and all that. 

What I *am* opposed to, is people doing something they see as distasteful but say it's a means to an end, then continuing to do it to fund an extravagant  lifestyle.

If my nan fell ill and I needed  £10k for whatever reason, so I started dealing drugs would that make me literally Hitler? No.

But if I then paid off my nans medical bills and carried on dealing so I could have an Aston Martin, a nice loft duplex in Chelsea, an apartment on the Vegas strip and tons of other shit, would I be a dick? Yes.

Let's call a spade a spade here.

Its not something relatively simple like a cleft palate that can be surgically repaired after delivery, these are babies with anencephaly (no brain), renal agenesis (no kidneys) and other conditions entirely incompatible with life. 

We are forcing these women to go to full term knowing that their baby won't survive delivery or will die immediately after delivery. Ending the pregnancy early will be easier to deal with physically, and will reduce the risk of pregnancy related complications. Imagine if you have a baby with no brain but you are forced to go to term-if there are uterine complications caused by the delivery (massive haemorrhage for example), the mother could end up losing her uterus and be incapable of having any subsequent pregnancies. At least if the delivery is earlier in the pregnancy then the mum will have a reduced risk of physical issues.  

I have no doubt that the DUP, in its brainless, mindless, racist, misogynistic scientifically illiterate troglodyte opinion thinks that the mother risking her uterus and potentially future pregnancies is a just punishment from god for even contemplating a termination.

Parental choice has to be the main issue-some women may choose to continue the pregnancy to term and that is entirely their right to do so.

&gt;Hi,

&gt;Thank you for getting in touch with your kind offer of donations. They would be really appreciated, will it be possible for you to drop them into the fundraising hub at the hospital please? We’re open between 9 and 5 on weekdays and you can pop in whenever you like within these times.

&gt;So from your apparent offence that I dare imply catch-all 'shields' imposed by my broadband provider are unwanted, potentially damaging to online freedoms and significantly affect the Internet and its users, can I assume you are in favour of them? If you are, please tell me why? I'd be interested to consider something I'm missing.

Firstly. Blame whomever pays the bill for your ISP for the block.  They can easily remove but have chosen not to. They are the ones who are restricting your browsing. 

I'm guessing you live with your parents. If that's the case you have no 'freedoms' that you think you should have. You have access to your parents internet connection and the restrictions that they chose (passively or actively) to impose. As a minor that's how it works. Tough shit. 

Now. Do I think the blocking is a good system?  no. It should be opt in not opt out. I shouldn't have to record my interest (as the bill payer) to have unrestricted access.  But it's a service that some people want and I have absolutely no issue with it being provided. I don't know if the person who pays for your internet access restricted it on purpose or by default.

I'm braced for down-votes here, but I'll **try** to justify myself before I get drowned in a shit-storm.

The statistics speak for themselves. On our unbeaten run this year, Gerrard was injured. He came back against United (when actually, we were still in the game) and he let his passion get the best of him. That started a huge down-turn in confidence.

I strongly believe Rodgers' faith in Gerrard as a holding midfielder was the biggest difference between our defence being torn apart or withstanding pressure. Joe Allen &amp; Jordan Henderson in the 3-4-3 protected the defenders very effectively as a duo, it was only when Gerrard returned to the line-up that we started losing again.

Gerrard deserved a send off, don't get me wrong, but he should not have played as a defensive midfielder. He doesn't now, never had and never will be disciplined enough to play the role. He relied on instincts and I would have thought playing him as a striker when our own strikers weren't delivering would be a no-brainer.",null,0,null,1434575011,null,0,false,0,cs9znud,null,t3_3a7bc2,null,t1_cs9znud,null,t3_3a7bc2,null,null,null,1437149187,null,35,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,35,null

Wild salmon are very well designed for life in the sea and rivers, and introducing traits such as faster growth and later maturity is unlikely to help them live long and have lots of successful offspring.

Secondly, the genetics of wild salmon are unique to the particular stretch of river in which they were born- they have evolved that way by migrating back to the same river in which they were born for many generations, and often even the exact same bit of river.  Put them in a different river  and they typically have very little long term reproductive success.  When you dilute the gene pool of a local population with too much ""foreign"" genetics then to begin to lose this specialisation to the particular river, which damages reproductive success of the stock (of course, there will be the odd salmon that goes to a different local river, thus preventing too much inbreeding).  This is why it's quite important if you try to restock a river with salmon that you've reared that you use salmon from that same river as the parents.

I'm not going to say that we are making a huge contribution, there is more money floating round one sq mile of London than there is in the entire Belfast area... but I don't think its just as bad as all that.

I owned a small company for a couple of years, it was a small Limited company... Registered Address Lisburn, but it was Registered and had its 'HQ' in Watford... because thats where my accountants were based.

I paid about 20k per year in Corp tax and VAT...but I was registered at a tax office in London and my HMRC offices were in London.  The only Northern Ireland based part of the company was the BT postcode.  Yet Of all the money I took home, I spent most of it in NI.

Where was my bank? Southampton HSBC

Thats great, but where did I spend it? Sainsburys,  Airlines, Audi... where do they report their group profits?  Sainsburys are in Holborn in London, BA is in London, Audi are in MiltonKeynes.
Sure a small amount of that money stayed in NI, probably that which bought the bread and milk and eggs... the rest, the vast majority of it shipped back to England and reported as profit to an English Company.  I could go on.. M&amp;S, Sky TV, Vodafone, BT Internet, not one of those companies needs to tell the government where it makes its money.

Prior to working for myself, I worked for a small consultancy firm based in the South of England, my tax office.. Portsmouth.. My economic output was registered as a SE England output and the tax and profit they made was spent there.

Even though i've lived in NI my entire life, I dont think i've actually worked for an NI company... yet I spend every penny in NI.   

So you've got to wonder, where the 'Net Contributor' bit comes from, where exactly do they get their figures?  I get that they know what they send to NI, but VAT and PAYE and Corp Tax are not easily known.

null,false,Username_taken1981,null,null,null,"I am right in the middle of purchasing a house with the help to buy scheme. As with anything, there are pros and cons. It it works for me and I really happy with my decision. 

Few details 
Property value; £145500
Help to buy@20%; £29100
5% from me; £7275

Mortgage value; £110, 125 (including £999 mortgage fee added). 

My salary; £30,000 (buying on own).

The help to buy has meant that I can afford to buy a new build home far sooner than expected. 

At the end of 5yrs I will start to pay back the HTB at approx £43 a month - your mortgage advisor will run this numbers for you before you commit to anything. 

In terms of the process, it's been pretty simple. I had to go through an eligibility check to make sure I qualified, fill in an application form, and well that's it. My solicitor is doing the rest. 

I can't help on the rent situation but my best advice would be get a mortgage advisor to talk you through the options. London and country / the mortgage bureau offer free advice, and are both brilliant in my experience. 

Yes, you have to pay it back but you know, I've worked since I was 18 and not once have I personally received any help from the government- no handouts, no tax credits, no benefits (and nor have I asked) but I do feel that as a single person, this was a good&amp; helpful option for me, and I've taken it. I've heard a lot of shit about the HTB scheme but my honest opinion is that it is like any loan- borrow it pay it back in time, just know what you are getting yourself in to first. 

You can pay off more at 5yrs. You can sell the property before 5yrs is up- you just have to pay the amount back from the sale based in the property value at that time (really do read the fine print on this). 

TLDR - Strong advice... Speak to an independent mortgage advisor and discuss all the options so you can make an informed decision. HTB won't suit everyone, it does me, but I went through the figures and all options before making the decision. Happy days.

I know that we can't attract some quality players like other top clubs (Chelsea, Man Utd, Barcelona, etc.) but that doesn't mean we can't attract any quality players at all and can only attract overhyped average players. I think there are still good players around that may want to come to us or believe in our project. 

Also, we just had a nightmare season but I don't think it's all down to Rodgers. He's responsible for many of the fuck ups but that doesn't mean that he isn't a quality manager. I do have my doubts about him and it would be nice to see a manager like Klopp work with us, but I'm not sure that sacking Rodgers would be the best decision.

It used to be a Scotsman, but he wants to go it alone so fuck him.

Edit: didn't like that one eh?

A couple of older ones.


There's an Englishman, a Scotsman and an Irishman all talking about their teenage daughters.The Englishman says, ""I was cleaning my daughter's room the other day and I found a packet of cigarettes. I was really shocked as I didn't even know she smoked.""
The Scotsman says, ""that's nothing. I was cleaning my daughter's room the other day when I came across a half full bottle of Vodka. I was really shocked as I didn't even know she drank."" 
With that the Irishman says, ""both of you have got nothing to worry about. I was cleaning my daughter's room the other day when I found a packet of condoms. I was really shocked. I didn't even know she had a penis.


An Englishman, Irishman and Scotsman where all homeless and hadn't eaten in days, one day they walked past a pub with a sign in the window that read ""Free all you can eat and drink, apply within"" 

They are suspicious of this sign and decide to scope it out individually, the Englishman goes first, walks up to the bar and asks about the free all you eat and drink.


The barman pours out a double whisky for both of them and tells the tale of how he lost his wife and that his 40 yr old daughter has never been with a man as she is bed ridden, he tells the Englishman all he needs to do is go upstairs and have sex with my daughter and you will be fed and supplied with as much drink as you desire, she will be expecting you

With the extra promise of sex on the cards the Englishman bounds upstairs, opens the room and the initial stench nearly made him sick, thinking of the food and alcohol he held his breath and walked in. 

There on the bed was a very, very large lady with her legs open with obvious herpes and previous bed saws scabs.

""I've been waiting for this, come and take me big boy"" she said

At that, the englishmans stomach turned and he ran back downstairs and straight out the pub, the Scotsman went next had his whiskey and went upstairs.

Entering the room he opened the window to let out the stench, thought about it for a couple of minutes and thought about giving it a go, he ripped off all the dried scabs from the inside of her legs and stuff them in an old crisp packet, while he was doing this the stench was killing him and he ended up puking up in some discarded cereal bowls that was located at tge foot of the bed, once finished he threw these out the window and got down to business. 

A couple of hours later the paraletic Scotsman exited the pub with a massive doggy bag of food and was surprised to see the Irishman still sat outside.

""You can have this"" he said offering his doggy bag.

So yes, we could run NASA for a year. Note setting up a British NASA and all the infrastructure and employment that would probably balloon that £11.5 billion quite a bit. Like at least three or four times, conservatively.

The ESA gets by on about[ £3.5 billion a year.](http://www.esa.int/For_Media/Highlights/ESA_budget_2015).

null,false,bockers7,lfc99,,null,"&gt; Gerrard was a good DM 2 seasons ago. but we played counter attacking football which made his job MUCH easier. 

Gerrard was good going forward as a DM but I disagree that he was a 'good' DM for us two years ago. It was easier to mask his mistakes due to our playing style which you mentioned but that doesn’t mean he was good cover for our back four. People seem to forget the fact that we conceded a ridiculous amount of goals that year – [55 total](http://ohyoubeauty.blogspot.dk/2014/05/liverpool-goals-for-and-against-2013-14.html) (50 in the league), 3 which came from pens. Out of those 52 goals, 40 of them were from open play. 40!! + 6 corners/FKs each. Gerrard missed 4 games total, and in those games we allowed 5 goals, 2 to each City/Chelsea and 1 to Cardiff - 4 of which were from open play. So in games that Gerrard was in front of our back four, we allowed 35 goals in the league + 4  in the two cups. 

That’s 39 goals allow in 39 games played by Gerrard, most of which came between the 76th and 90th minutes. You can weigh out his contributions going forward and leadership to make up for his defensive flaws that year, but that does not mean he was a good defensive midfielder. 39 goals in 39 games played is too much.  

Simply put, our downfall that year was our defense, and that starts with our DM.

With that said, I agree with everything else you said regarding Lucas. ",null,0,null,1434578537,null,0,1434578776,0,csa1t3p,null,t3_3a6359,null,t1_csa1t3p,null,t1_cs9t1xy,null,null,null,1437150769,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

* Volume will automatically adjust up/down in volume as it senses wind noise increases. You can also adjust volume manually so that it plays higher when there is much wind noise and doesn't turn the volume so far down when you stop at red lights / intersections.
* Haven't tested intercom range properly yet, but the random rider I met and had a cup of coffee (who pretty much convinced me to buy it) with said it was roughly the 1 mile advertised range, give or take.
* Includes lot's of extra equipment for mounting it on your helmet, includes different types of brackets (clamps, glue), different mic's (one optimized for open helmets), boosters for the speakers if your helmet has deep ear ""sockets"".
* Not tested battery time properly yet, but again, the guy who convinced me to get it said it seemed to be much like the advertised talk time, give or take 15 minutes.

null,false,MrLiamD,newcr-6,,null,"There are arguments to be made that commercially we haven't been ambitious enough particularly in the USA, and the same goes for building a stadium, although there are more than enough reasons to be very cautious with that, Arsenal are arguably the best run club in the country and they still had major problems competing financially in the years after building their stadium, and it's a similar story with Valencia. Because of this we shouldn't build a new stadium unless we have a very, very solid, low risk plan. I'd much rather stay at Goodison than risk financial meltdown. The same goes for allowing potentially risky businessmen to purchase the club, we need to be positive they will not take the club down a level. I'd much rather stick with our board than risk a Venky, a Hicks and Gillett, a Tan, an Ashley, a Bates, a Winkelman etc. We might see owners come in with bids and get excited, then complain when nothing happens, but for all we know our board knows they would have turned into a disaster.

However, in terms of transfers I think only selling when we get a ridiculous bid, the only major loss in recent years was Fellaini and we doubled our money on him after accepting an offer for well more than he was worth, keeping hold of Baines, Jagielka and Coleman in particular, shows good ambition and a solid approach to transfers going out. 

Our purchases in my opinion have been excellent and ambitious. You can't claim buying Lukaku for £28m and beating out competition from Juventus, Liverpool and Wolfsburg wasn't ambitious enough, despite it not working out Eto'o was also a very ambitious move we successfully pulled. Purchasing Deulofeu for a rumoured £2.2m is not only ambitious but an incredibly impressive price. 

Given our financial capabilities, perhaps hampered by a lack of nouse in the marketing department I'll admit, I believe our transfer dealings over the last 10 years to be overall very good and although we could possibly have benefited from being a little more ambitious, we have generally done very well. You can't complain at a lack of spending on players whilst simultaneously complaining that we should be building a new stadium, the two are mutually exclusive for a club with our resources.

Since the reformation of Channel 3 in 1993, however, it has relied completely on commercial operations for funding. Any ""profit"" is re-invested in programming while any shortfall is covered by cash reserves.

Until a couple of years ago CH4 lobbied for a taste of the licence fee, particularly in the lean years after the cancellation of Big Brother, but has now decided it doesn't want - now or in the future - to have any licence fee funding because of the increased oversight which may affect its remit to be a bit cheeky.

You should really be asking yourself whether that's so objectionable.

Likewise on the Tory quotes. Those aspects of the Tory campaign - fiscal responsibility and economic competence - were key messages the public responded to. To me it doesn't make sense that we should observe the Tories winning elections with certain messages and then refuse to steal those messages from them because they've already been used by the Tories, like dirty undies or something.

This source seems to be providing general figures (for all 'racially or religiously aggravated harassment crimes' and hate crimes) and not the figures specifically relating to islam or muslims, hopefully not in an attempt to conflate the two. One thing I could find is [this](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/17/hate-crimes-against-muslims-britain-spike-jihadi-attacks-study), which records 548 incidents in 2014-15, 734 in 2013-14, and 584 in 2012-13. However these are self-reported (so not derived from police data), and include 'online abuse and threats, to street-based assaults and extreme violence', so not all of them may necessarily fall under the definition of what is criminal, or a case of a committed criminal offence. There is information on specific regions such as [London](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-29424165) or very sporadic national data such as [this article](http://www.getwestlondon.co.uk/news/west-london-news/islamophobic-hate-crimes-soar-more-9367212) comparing the Januaries of each year, but unfortunately all the comprehensive data seems to classify hate crimes 'involving an element of faith, religious hate or Islamophobia' together which is very unhelpful when trying to reach a real conclusion about statistics such as these - though as I understand this will probably change soon.

Sign up for Foreverton, this is about £20 and allows you to access ticket sales a few days before the general public. Keep an eye on the tickets section of the official site, this will give you the time table of when tickets go on sale. If you get on within the first day you'll be able to get a decent seat. 

I was pitch side for my first derby, and it's a great experience, but if you've been the game before I'd sit further up and towards the middle of either bullens or main stand and you get a great view of all the action. 

The only issue with this is that Foreverton is only valid for one customer so you can only buy one ticket, I think it's possible to register another customer to your account and buy them another Foreverton card but I have no experience with that, might be worth calling the box office.

null,false,userfailed,crest-new,,null,"Hate to go to an old cliché but first post nails it. The position we are in is excellent but precarious and has to be treated carefully. The number of clubs screwed by over ambitious boards (including us to a certain extent under Peter Johnson) is far higher than the number of clubs who successfully move up a level.

At the moment we have done well replacing our long term manager. We had a European hangover this year, our defense decided to die on its arse until after the new year. Shelling out £30+ million in players only allowed us to keep our excellent loan buys of the year before and two promising, younger players. Atsu didn't work out as well as we hoped, but was worth the look.

This summer we have got Cleverly on a free after getting Aston Villa to shake off his lack of 1st team action rust, Deulofeu on the cheap is an excellent move for a young, talented player who shouldn't have any trouble settling in again. Hopefully get Lennon back as well (assuming Levy isn't his usual Satan incarnate self during the negotiations) for a reasonable fee would be a good move too.

Assuming the above happens we can get a wish list going for sorting out the defense as well. For me, if we could get rid of Mirallas for a decent fee and use that money to get Bergovic and maybe someone like Caulker, we are well on the way to reducing the age of the squad with realistic targets who have lots of premiership experience, no Europe to worry about this year gives us 10+ games less to play this year with the associated travelling removed also.

Off the back of these moves we should have a better time of it this year, play well and becoming more appealing on the commercial also (simplistic view I know but a reasonable expectation). At this point Bill and co have a better 'product' to move.

Now moving into the realms of fantasy, convert Tim into an ambassador role after doing a transition year to Bergovic, get Timmy Cahill in for a similar role and charm the crap out of the U.S and Aus. Be realistic about where we can move to in the Liverpool, make a few good decisions with the council and commercial partners and sort out the stadium. Hopefully a move like this will enable Bill to get some investment on board while remaining in control.

This over a 2 year period or so, leaves us with a younger squad. 2 legends representing us in big growth markets, potential new investment and a squad that should be able to go for a cup or a European spot, all while being cautious so if unforeseen problems come up we are not overexposed.

None of this would have been possible (in the realms of extreme conjecture granted) without the work that has been done over the past decade by Bill, David and Roberto. More would have been possible but at least we haven't done a Leeds, or a Q.P.R, or a Postsmouth.......

An Englishman, Scotsman and an Irishman are on a plane.  During their flight the captain calls them up to the flight deck and issues them a challenge. 

He says:  ""I will give 1 million pounds to whichever one of you can tell where we are by sticking your hand out of the window""

So the Englishman grins and steps up, puts his hand out of the plane window and thinks for a second, before saying ""Manchester"", the pliot tells him this isn't correct and sends him back to his seat.

The Irishman gets up next and puts his hand out of the window, after a while he says: ""Cork!"", but the pilot shakes his head and sends him back.

Then the Scotsman goes up and puts his hand out of the window, after a moment he brings his arm back in and says: ""Glasgow"".  Astonished, the pilot asks: ""How did you know?"", the Scotsman replies: ""My watch has been stolen"".

___

An Englishman, Scotsman and an Irishman are in France just after the start of Operation Overlord, they have been cut off from their unit and seek refuge in a barn.  Later that night they hear a German patrol coming round, so they need to hide.

In the barn there are three large sacks, so they all agree to try hiding in them.  No sooner are they all in their sacks when the Wermacht burst in the door, they see the three sacks and view them suspiciously.

They approach the sack with the Englishman inside and kick it, quick-witted the Englishman says ""woof"" in his best dog impression, and the Germans shrug and walk to the next one.

Reaching the sack with the Scotsman inside they kick that one, and following the Englishman's example the Scotsman says ""meow"" in his best cat voice and the Germans leave it be.

Then they approach the sack with the Irishman inside, as with the others they kick it and the Irishman says ""potatoes"".

/r/SquaredCircle used to be like that.  If it was even tangentially connected with wrestling, it was fair game.  As a result, every tweet from big name wrestlers was posted.  People would post about a brief mention of someone who was in WWE for about 5 seconds 20 years ago on a TV show.

And this was the stuff that was getting upvoted.

The mods introduced a rule that all link posts must be directly about wrestling.  As a result, the sub is much better and I don't have to wade through a pile of [insert wrestler name here] tweets about their lunch! posts to get to stuff that's actually worth reading.

&gt;Of 52 groups where ethnicity data was provided, 26 (50 per cent) comprised all Asian offenders, 11 (21 per cent) were all white, 9 (17 per cent) groups had offenders from multiple ethnicities, 4 (8 per cent) were all black offenders and there were 2 (4 per cent) exclusively Arab groups.

&gt;Of the 306 offenders whose ethnicity was noted, 75 per cent were categorised as Asian, 17 per cent white, and the remaining 8 per cent black (5 per cent) or Arab (3 per cent).

&gt;By contrast, the seven “Type 2 groups” – paedophile rings rather than grooming gangs – “were reported as exclusively of white ethnicity”.

&gt;So-called “Type 2″ groups – where the offenders have a long-standing sexual interest in children, were much less common. Only seven known or suspected paedophile rings were reported to Ceop.

-

&gt;I'm actually more inclined to believe that the means by which these crimes happen amongst different ethnic and cultural groups is very different.

Correct. White pedophiles tend to network in secret pedophile groups. Pakistanis invite their family, friends, and coworkers in, because this stuff is practically normalised in their communities.

&gt;We don't have anything like accurate numbers so nobody can really say.

Correct. For every ring run by half a dozen Pakistanis, there are scores of rapist clients. This doesn't seem to be happening with the white offenders.

&gt; the Saville revelations

Any idea why it's impossible to refer to this Asian gang problem as, say, 'the Hussain revelations'?

&gt; I was just suggesting that for someone to agree that it is proportional whilst playing a game of guess the ethnicity and choosing muslim asian based on a town of 80% white people is pretty fucking stupid.

Correct. Whites are committing disproportionately less. Asians are vastly overrepresented. But I don't think anyone is claiming that it is proportionate; they're just pointing out the craven stupidity of saying that whites commit the most crime by numbers, as though whites aren't 90% of the population.",null,0,null,1434586244,null,0,1434586577,0,csa5yhd,null,t3_3a4y6u,null,t1_csa5yhd,null,t1_cs9hhth,null,null,null,1437153857,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

null,false,Sorrel-Anne,null,null,null,"You're a bit late looking for a student house, especially in Liverpool which has five universities: they go quickly but the upside is that there are many specialist student landlords. Most insist that everyone living in a student house is a full time student so you need to check that. If you don't live in a student house your rent is likely to be higher too. (For a student house in Liverpool expect to pay between £45 and £90 a week, depending on quality, bills included etc).

You will have to pay more if you're the only student simply because  you won't be exempt from council tax the way households which are all students are. More on the rules [here](https://www.gov.uk/council-tax/who-has-to-pay).

The big student areas in Liverpool are Kensington and Wavertree. Kensington is very close (think five minutes walk) to Uni of and John Moores. Wavertree has the larger student population and is closer to Hope, but still not far from the city center with two large supermarkets, plenty of shops and regular buses. Avoid Toxteth, if you can: it's cleared up considerably but I still wouldn't want it to be my first introduction to living by myself in a new city. (It is, however, right next to Wavertree and the rent is cheaper)

When I was looking back in February, I found these companies particularly helpful:

[Golding](http://www.goldingestates.co.uk/students/) (Does non-student homes too)

[Liverpool Student Lets](http://www.liverpoolstudentlets.co.uk/html/lsl/student-homes-liverpool.php)

[My Student Home](http://my-student-home.com/)

[Your Place](http://yourplaceuk.com/)

Avoid Accommod8, they are generally considered to be shady. You could also try Rightmove, which is how I found my next flat.

The puff piece claimed that Cameron's 'presentational skills were never in doubt' and pointed to 'his easy charm and ability to appear ""prime ministerial"" at news conferences and summits'. A photo caption told readers that:*

**'David Cameron took the traditional route to the top via Eton and Oxford.'**

*This was Tory PR dressed up as BBC journalism. The sycophancy was so laughable and transparent that it was rightly described on Twitter as:*

**'A beautiful example of Toady Tory journalism'**

Would be astonished to find that places like Stormfront (to an extent) and the smaller white nationalist groups' web presences (to a larger extent) aren't being actively monitored even in a vague, dragnet sense. 

Fundamentally, though- it's not the police's job to stop people being racist, nor should it ever be. They should only step in when people's private views cross over into public action- the most they can reasonably be expected to do is keep an eye on groups whose membership is likely to intersect in a significant sense with extremist organisations, and keep any information they gather to hand to help with investigations in the future.

null,false,adnams94,BnW,,null,"First off let me saying I like that your trying to keep level headed, respect that alot, but I'd throw in a few points to think about in counter to some of yours.

Pogba is a dream, and I respect your view that his fee may well be getting out of hand and our likelihood of signing him is pretty low, but when you say we could sign Isco and KDB for that price I think you're being optimistic. Pogba might be around £80mil, fee and wage included. If we take the view that KDB will be at least £35mil, plus whatever his wages are,thats probably £45mil right there. Then consider Isco is of similar calibre, but the club has even less incentive to sell, it's probably even more. Yes a similar price range, but getting them released from their clubs is not just a case of offering up big sums of cash - Wolfsburg want to compete in the Champions league and, well Madrid are Madrid.

If Real were to move players out of their midfield with Khedeira this season, I don't think Isco would be the first to go either. Illara and Casemiro are both similar ages but not the same standard. I could really only see them possibly letting Isco go if they actually did sign Pogba, by which point there'd be no debate about us getting him anyway.

I dream of seeing those young guns in the team to though, but I'm afraid I'm not certain all three will make a true transition into a first team reserve. Maybe one, but all three I'd be very skeptical about - I think it'd be hard to get enough rotation in for all of them without compromising form like our chairman said recently.

As for the home grown thing, I also really hate it when people pipe up about it all the time, but we cant ignore it. If we got Sterling for this £40mil we just sent in, which IMO is a take it or leave it from us, then I doubt we'd get KDB much cheaper than that at all. Yes Kevin is the better player overall, but Raheen has 3 more years on him, and has been playing at the professional level nearly as long.
And while we can include some younger squad players in the team, having no English starters and just loopholing the rules is going to get us a hell of a lot of criticism. Milner was our English rock along with Hart in that sense. There's also the fact that players under 21 don't contribute to the squad list, but if we have 17 foreign players (the current alowed quota) plus Joe, Clichy, thats only 19 players. To then say that were going to go into a season with 19 players, and only young English prospects who might not be up to the quality of our first team is certainly a little hap-hazardous IMO. We don't need a shitload more, but one or two solid Enlish boys would be nice for peace of mind and so don't end up in an injury crisis.

b) The above link is in /r/Database. Also check-out/search/ask: /r/SQL, /r/Oracle, /r/SQLServer

c) At some point, you'll need to pick a platform. Continue to do your research, search around, figure out what's hot in your area. My personal preference is Microsoft SQL Server, but I'm a .NET developer. If you're more comfortable with *nix machines, go with Oracle. Luckily for you, Oracle and Microsoft both offer ""Express"" editions of their Database Management Systems, so you can download them and play around with them. 

d) You need to learn SQL. It's fairly similar across platforms, but there are differences, so you need to know which platform you're going to be working on. SQL really is easy. There are tons of free resources, all over the internet. Check out Udemy, Udacity, Coursera, YouTube, even just Google it.

This 1-9 idea is nonsense. I understand the appeal of wanting to have standards similar to other countries, but surely maintaining the compatibility with people who have taken GCSE's in the past is far more important? 

Forcing everyone to take a language GCSE is a waste of time. Everybody knows that taking a language at GCSE helps you not one bit at actually *learning* the language, so making everyone take one does nothing. A common argument is that it encourages people to study them further, but page 90 of [this document](
http://www.britishcouncil.org/sites/britishcouncil.uk2/files/language-trends-survey-2014.pdf) shows that only happens in 12% of cases.

I wrote [this bill](http://www.reddit.com/r/MHOC/comments/2wl4i7/b058_foreign_language_education_reform_bill_2nd/) on /r/MHOC to try and improve language education, and my personal view is that making everyone learn a language is only beneficial when the aim is set at allowing them to use it after leaving school. Also considering only 48% of people do a language at GCSE, and a 9% shortfall in teacher recruitment, I predict that trying to make everybody learn one will lead to an influx of poorly-trained teachers in schools - not exactly helping anything at all.

&gt;The aim is to make standards comparable to top-performing countries such as Finland

Did you know that the phrase ""hard-working people"" was originally coined by New Labour? 

They used to use it in a left-wing context, as in ""We are introducing tax credits to help hard working families"". They knew Tories would claim that tax credits were ""benefits"" (dread word) so the idea was to emphasize that this was going to ""hard working families"" - i.e. people in work, who were working very hard but weren't making much and needed help. It was a clever way to deflect criticism. Both Blair and Brown used to pepper their speeches with ""hard working familes"" every time they talked about the help they were giving.

The conservatives stole the phrase to make themselves sound more centrist, and they've been so successful in hijacking the language that Labour people now are attacking other Labour people for using a phrase Labour originally coined! Because they now believe it is a ""Cameron campaign slogan"", and if he lifted it, it must be evil! Actually he lifted it because it was successful, a good use of language.

And that final twist just shows what has gone wrong in Labour - this is a party that just attacks itself, and especially attacks everything successful about itself, instead of defending both the ideas and the words and saying to the Tories, ""push off, this is *our* language, our phrase"". So much for ""I could understand campaigning for Labour on a Blairite stance"" - poor Liz!

P.S. Here's Gordon Brown's 2005 pre-election budget:

http://www.theguardian.com/business/2005/mar/16/publicfinances.budget2005

'A budget for hard-working families and pensioners'

Here's an interesting article from 2005 which noted just how much Labour were banging on about ""hard working families"":

http://jackthurston.com/articles/hardworking-families/

&gt;The Labour Party will seek to win a third term of office with a claim to be on the side of Britain’s “hard-working families”. The expression “hard-working families” is by now a familiar feature of the political landscape. It peppered Labour’s 2001 election manifesto and was spelt out in giant letters on the stage backdrop at the party’s conference last autumn, dwarfing the delegates standing to address the party faithful. You will find it in speeches and articles by Cabinet ministers, backbench MPs and youthful political wannabes. It even bridges Britain’s great political divide between the Prime Minister and his Chancellor. A Google search of the world wide web reveals 1,409 occurrences of the phrase in conjunction with Tony Blair. Gordon Brown is only marginally behind with 1,110 hits. Lacking any decent catchphrases of their own, the Tories have lately adopted the expression, rather unimaginatively arguing “no, no, no, don’t listen to them, it’s the Conservative Party, not Labour, that’s the real friend of Britain’s hard-working families”.

And it's a very sorry state of affairs that the Conservatives have been so successful in pinching the idea that any New lab person who was working on the 2001 and 2005 manifestos (like Liz Kendall did as a spad at teh time) is being attacked by Labour people for something that was Labour and those same lab people voted for!

The irony is that the Conservatives will cut tax credits (the thing that ""hard-working families"" was coined to help introduce). And they will be aided by the useful idiots on the Labour side who would rather be in opposition than admit that New Labour did anything good (tax credits, building and staffing 149 new hospitals to help increase NHS capacity, giving rights to temporary and part-time workers, oh a million other things that are all now in jeopardy thanks to some Lab people taking a holier-than-thou attitude to New Labour).",null,0,null,1434592785,null,0,1434595478,0,csa9afq,null,t3_3a6t8j,null,t1_csa9afq,null,t1_cs9wjr5,null,null,null,1437156374,null,3,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,3,null

Migrants from the EU should not be allowed to vote given the obvious conflict of interest. Those here for more than 5 years should be allowed since they've stayed long enough to be residents imo. 

Under 18's should not get the vote because they are not adults. The allowing of 16-17 year olds in the Scottish referendum does not make it okay for children to have a say. I am very much reminded of my sixth form days of doing a canvassing of my fellow students opinions on voting intentions. More than 1/3rd said they didn't care/had no intention of voting and roughly another 1/3rd were voting the same way as their parents with not a clue of ideology or policies. Of particular note I encountered several who intended to vote based on the colour of the party, great moment for my idealism there. 16-17 year olds who are actually clued in on politics are rare and far and few between. If you're one of them good on you.

This talk of who's allowed and not allowed to vote in itself wrong. Purdah IS the real issue since lobbying and government influence should not be allowed to trounce the democratic mandate of the people to choose freely. A free and fair referendum is what the people of this country need for both sides of the debate since those opposed want a fair election to put it to rest and for those in support to have a decisive show of support for the EU.",null,0,null,1434592809,null,0,false,0,csa9awl,null,t3_3a7sp9,null,t1_csa9awl,null,t3_3a7sp9,null,null,null,1437156380,null,1,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,1,null

You would seem to be claiming otherwise but I'm not aware of a BBC 'puff piece' in which a british politician is lauded by an interviewer who only stops heaping praise on the subject to attack their opponents. 

Not only does the BBC article you so object to at no point refer to Cameron's opponents as toxic it also includes some not exactly hagiographic passages:

&gt; ""In my experience, Cameron never gave a straight answer when dissemblance was a plausible alternative,"" business journalist Jeff Randall

&gt;He was captain of Brasenose College's tennis team and a member of the Bullingdon dining club, famed for its hard drinking and bad behaviour, a period Mr Cameron has always refused to talk about.

&gt; He has also consistently dodged the question of whether he took drugs at university.

&gt; Mr Cameron says he did not know the call was being made or who made it, but it is sometimes held up by his opponents as an example of his gilded passage to the top.

&gt;The media, eager for a new story after years of Tory failure and with an increasingly unpopular Labour government, gave him the glowing coverage he craved, helping him to ""decontaminate"" the Tory brand and move the party back towards the centre ground, where, the conventional wisdom has it, British elections are won and lost.

&gt; He also cannily used the expenses scandal that rocked Westminster to portray himself as a radical reformer bent on cleaning up politics.

&gt; What's more, his big idea, the Big Society, the fruit of detailed policy work stretching back to the early days of his leadership, which envisaged parents setting up their own schools and groups of public sector workers forming co-operatives, failed to capture voters' imagination in the way he had hoped.

&gt; In August 2013, he suffered a major blow to his authority when he became the first prime minister in more than 100 years to lose a foreign policy vote, after dozens of Conservative MPs joined forces with Labour to block his plans for military intervention in Syria.

&gt; He was later forced to issue an apology to the Queen, after he was overheard telling New York mayor Michael Bloomberg Her Majesty had ""purred down the line"" when he informed her that Scotland had rejected independence.

&gt; For some, his handling of the referendum issue, by offering last-minute concessions to the nationalists, added to the idea of Mr Cameron as an ""essay crisis"" prime minister, who only gets fully engaged with an issue when all seems lost.",null,0,null,1434594682,null,0,false,0,csaaa1q,null,t3_3a70el,null,t1_csaaa1q,null,t1_csa9c1q,null,null,null,1437157042,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

He did a stonking anti-Lithuanian speech for example, not because he was xenophobic but because uncontrolled immigration was hurting the people who he was representing - their pain was *real* no matter what the liberal classes thought.

And what was more the fledgling Labour party was successful in putting pressure on the govt of the day to do something about it - the Liberal govt stopped free movement of people and introduced passports for the first time in 1906 in response to the pressure from people like Hardie. (Free movement of people then returned via Margaret Thatcher's single european act, which was signed in 1985 and came into force in 1992 - and hey presto, the working classes are agitating about it again, and flirting with UKIP because Labour appears not to be interested in their woes).

As for deficits and surpluses - in the last 100 years, the Conservatives have presided over just 1 budget surplus in the year 1987/88. Labour managed it five times despite being in power for many fewer years! (48/49, 49/50, 98/99, 99/00, 00/01).

How has it happened that a Labour person can get attacked for saying things that Attlee and Hardie would have agreed with? Are ""traditional supporters"" that far away from the those ideas? 

You seem to have an idea that ""labour principles"" must be the opposite of anything a successful Labour leader espoused (so anything Attlee, Hardie, Blair and co did is *evil* and anything the failures said is good).

I could never understand the people I grew up surrounded by who simply would never put the same amount of effort in my mother did, even when they didn't have all the challenges. These same people have directly said that they just wanna live on benefits and maybe do the odd job on the side forever.

While in secondary school, my tutor asked my class what we wanted to do when we left school and easily 30% of the class outright stated they wanted to have a baby, get a house from the gov and get money from the gov. And then they did it.

null,false,prototype45,null,null,null,"Well, he will have one of the best supports in the world at chelsea. He will have Hazard, who with his unselfish nature will literally do all the hard work by beating the defenders and laying it on a plate for you like he's done countless this season, and then there's the magic man who can ping a ball right to his feet from halfway across the pitch and find his runs like he did with Costa. Not to mention, a first-half-of-the-season oscar who can exchange brilliantly with forwards and link up with him. 

In the game today, I think that 3 on 3(or 2?) opportunity where he had support to his left and to his right but hesitated and took a shot really summed his recent form up. This wasn't something that had to do with his support, this is a psychological and self confidence problem, something we will hope Mourinho can magically help improve.

I feel that IF he can somehow get through this mental block and regain some of his self confidence, the he *might* be in for a good season, because at the moment he looks like one of those space jam players that got his abilities sucked out of him. This is why I haven't really had much of a say in this whole Falcao saga, I really don't know what to think about it because it can really go either way I think. He's still falcao, he's the same human force that ripped defences apart not too long ago and his abilities that made him amazing are not one to decay quickly with age as it would with some other players. Hopefully, he can get off on the right foot at chelsea, maybe score 1 or 2 goals early in his spell and I think that might do wonders for him psychologically. 

In the end, if the support I described that he will be getting at chelsea along with the added bonus of Mourinho voodoo doesn't help him, then I don't think anything else will. This is a chance for a new start and I hope he can take this opportunity.

null,false,sjampen,lfc99,,null,"I disagree. Firstly, Emre Can IMO just haven't reached a level where he can be counted on for LFC. 

I also think that if he ever becomes good enough, its as a DM, not a CM. Can is strong on the ball and has a good drive, especially when we utilized him as a CB, but he often dribbles into dead ends and struggles finding the passes that a true maestro style CM should. 

However, he did show good strength in defensive man to man duels when we disregard Eden Hazard and those players, and Cans weak games, he is 21 years old, weak games are to be expected. I was also very impressed with his aerial ability as a CB, which would look very strong as a midfielder against other midfielders and not constantly fighting Bony or Giroud. If he can supplement his strong duel abilities with a strong disciplin and tactical awareness, and learn from Nemanja Matic and utilize quicker passing instead of getting in over his head, he'll become a very good DM. I find that far more likely than Can suddenly picking up the quicker shortpassing game and passing overview, simply because it's his greatest weakness right now. He does share Yaya Toures powerfull drive, albeit to a lesser extend, but he simply isn't as keen a passer or finisher as Toure, nor has the same technical ability or flair. 

I do however agree with people wanting to shoehorn players into our team, but i'll still take Can over Allen defensively and then hoping Emre develops into what we need. Allen, Hendo, Milner/Can might be the least creative midfield I can think of, which Coutinho might not even be able to salvage, and despite a very large working area, having Allen, Hendo and Milner frankly isn't a very strong defensive midfield either.

To sum it up his contention is that the concept of voting for an MP that represents a local constituency doesn't work because most people don't actually know who their MP is and that the overall results are ""unrepresentative"". 

Representation is an interesting idea, and one the left seems to have become obsessed with. The idea is if you have a 10-man parliament representing a 20-man nation of 8 women and 12 men the parliament **MUST!!!111oneone!!!*** have 4 women and 6 men... else it's unrepresentative... and ?bad. It means each person has to have equal clout and that there can be no upper hand... it's a cute idea and its easy to see its appeal.

It's a fallacy though. You can make parliaments more representative I'm sure... but ultimately there will always be differences between politicians and their voters. Instead, the British parliamentary democracy works by having representation in the sense that you as an individual are represented in parliament by a specific individual. The bottom line is that an individual is **accountable** to you. It's a microcosm of democracy and it shouldn't be underestimated. Let's think of two examples;

* Jacob Rees Mogg is often controversial. People often describe him as being the honorable member for the 19th century. However, he's eloquent, polite, turns up to the commons and is a vociferous supporter of his local constituency in Somerset. He proactively advocates Somerset industry, education, health and general welfare. In reward for his efforts to represent those people, they returned him to parliament with a larger majority.

* Ed Balls was essentially the second in command of the Labour party. A divisive man who has been involved in a number of allegations of scandal including a hit and run and expenses abuses. One of his lower moments involved posting his own name on Twitter in what can only be described as ""going full retard"". Despite being a party grandee he lost his seat in the election, because he failed to impress the people in his local constituency of Morley and Outwood.

Was our election really that unrepresentative... personally I think not. I think it's easy to over-analyze the numbers and miss the point;

* England wanted a government that favored fiscal restraint and economic reform, and perhaps more importantly didn't want a left leaning anti-austerity government... they got it with the Conservatives. 

* Scotland wanted to be represented in parliament ""as Scots"". They got it with their SNP landslide.

* Although the UK broadly seems to support the EU, there is widespread consensus amongst the population that the idea needs to be put to the people - and indeed that there are many things about the arrangement that could be improved. Labours failure to back an EU referendum cost them at the polls I've no doubt.

People who talk so much about electoral reform almost entirely seem to be coming from the left, and it's worth pointing out that the people who would have lost our under a more representative system would have been the SNP and Lib dems. The real winners by a long shot would have been UKIP and with boundary reform the conservatives. 

So CGP goes some way to address that with these preferences for other ""proportional"" systems... but the problem with these is you tend to end up with a ""least dislikable"" candidate, or the path of most agreement. In essence it's running government by committee and it doesn't always work as well as you'd hope it would - as we've seen with these technocratic administrations springing up. Parliament ends up being replaced by a group of boring grey-people who struggle to communicate their ideas, and can be very difficult to take radical action as all their ideas have to be subjected to a process of broad consensus. It's ultimately about leadership, and those candidates don't always make good leaders. Trying to make changes in those sorts of systems is like trying to steer an oil tanker.",null,0,null,1434607548,null,0,1434607821,0,csag1b6,null,t3_3a25gi,null,t1_csag1b6,null,t3_3a25gi,null,null,null,1437161126,null,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2,null
