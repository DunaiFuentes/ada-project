Constructed in the 1920s on the sandy Dwyryd estuary of north Wales, beneath Snowdonia’s majestic peaks, Portmeirion’s buildings run the stylistic gamut: Jacobean and Gothic, Norwegian and Regency. They are pink and red, green and ochre. Each roofline differs from the next

Eclectic, eccentric Portmeirion is one of the most recognisable attractions in Wales. The lifelong project of an architect with a passion for beauty, it would have been easy for the village to be frozen in time, a relic its 1930s heyday. Instead, it has continued to change and evolve. If there’s anything constant about Portmeirion – other than its beauty – it is its capacity for reinvention.

I first came to the village as a schoolboy in 1968. At the time, all I knew was it was featured in the bizarre British secret agent television series The Prisoner. I fell in love with Portmeirion that day. Britain was still going through a self-imposed period of post-war ugliness; it seemed to me terribly important that there was a grownup in the country who believed in beauty.

That grownup, a Welshman called Clough Williams-Ellis, was born in 1883. He was a successful but virtually self-taught architect – and he despaired of the 20th Century’s attachment to Functionalism and Brutalism. He wanted to show, as he once wrote, “that buildings properly situated within a landscape could actually enhance the scenery.” In 1925, Williams-Ellis bought a small estate on the edge of Snowdonia and started proving his point, building on pretty, wooded slopes that ran down to the estuary.

There was already a gentleman’s residence on the estate, which he immediately turned into a hotel. Williams-Ellis always intended that his village – which he called Portmeirion, a fanciful name coined from Merionethshire, one of the 13 historic counties of Wales – would be a tourist destination.

There were a few other buildings, too, mainly stables and outbuildings, which Williams-Ellis embellished in a colourful manner that owed more to style than necessity. “Cloughed up” became a fashionable term for his technique. He painted shutters on the facade of one cottage, attached a statue of St Peter to another. His approach was just as irreverent as his style: he would draw his concept, then let his builders work out how to achieve it.

But most of the village was new – in the sense that new uses were found for old, salvaged pieces of architecture. In the years after World War One and World War Two, modernising architects were demolishing a lot of Britain’s architectural heritage. Williams-Ellis acquired these buildings, or their parts, to reuse – so much so that he declared Portmeirion “a home for fallen buildings”. His pseudo-Town Hall, for example, used a carved Jacobean ceiling that the architect purchased from a Flintshire stately home awaiting demolition – and also recycled an upturned pig boiler to create a copper-painted coronet on its spire.

Portmeirion plays impishly with perspective, too. On a visit this spring, when I arrived at the Unicorn, my pink Palladian “cottage,” I was surprised to find that it took far fewer steps than I’d expected to get from the road outside to the front door: the Neoclassical façade tacked onto the building makes it look much larger from far away than it really is.

Williams-Ellis and his writer wife Amabel hoped that their village would inspire painters. But artists never arrived – perhaps, ironically, because Portmeirion was already a work of art. Still, thanks to Amabel’s contacts with the London literati, many celebrities were soon accepting invitations, including the playwright George Bernard Shaw, novelist H G Wells, architect Frank Lloyd Wright and director Noel Coward (who famously wrote his play Blithe Spirit here in 1941, having left London to escape the Luftwaffe bombing). When Edward, Prince of Wales – perhaps the most eligible man of his generation – came to visit in 1943, Williams-Ellis added a private ensuite to one of the hotel rooms and temporarily increased the village’s entrance fee to £1 to keep down daytripper numbers. By World War Two, Portmeirion had become a visual and social phenomenon, so much so that Williams-Ellis bought a hotel in the Shropshire market town of Shrewsbury to act as a halfway house for those motoring up from London.

When my parents and I first came here as day-trippers in the 1960s, a sliding scale of admission charges was indicated on the toll house wall: your payment depended on whether you were a resident, annual pass member or day-tripper. (“Residents” referred to overnight guests at the resort; no one, aside from Williams-Ellis, owned property). Not that the prices were always followed. The cost of a day pass could suddenly go up in the middle of the day if the village got too crowded as Williams-Ellis wanted his residents to feel relaxed and at home. For all of his quirky instincts as an architect, Williams-Ellis had a clear streak of British pragmatism. He needed Portmeirion to pay for itself or he would not be able to fund his vision.

These days, Portmeirion is always busy. And while fine dining is still offered in the hotel’s Art Deco dining room, the village is more egalitarian, the sliding scale of prices abolished.

Walking down from the Unicorn early in the morning, I passed a row of shops with faux Dutch gabling where a cafe was opening for the day visitors. Outside the pseudo-Town Hall, the empty bottles were being taken quietly out from last night’s reception.

It seemed surprising that such a famous anomaly could survive into the 21st Century – never mind become more popular than ever before.

“The village has always muddled along,” William-Ellis’ grandson and Portmeirion’s managing director, the writer Robin Llywelyn, told me over coffee. ""Various members of the family have often pursued their own interests. But somehow, this has worked to the long-term benefit of Portmeirion.”

Susan Williams-Ellis, Llywelyn’s mother and Clough’s daughter, founded Portmeirion Pottery, ceramics based on her original designs, in Stoke-on-Trent in 1960; her Botanic Garden tableware range has become a British classic. Llywelyn himself pursued the arts while running Portmeirion, launching a music and arts festival in the village in 2012. He hopes to soon start a literary festival. “Clough always wanted Portmeirion to be a place for things to happen, where events might take place, to be a setting,” Llywelyn said.

In film, at least, it has been for years. Portmeirion’s variety of architecture has allowed it to stand in for many locations: France (Brideshead Revisited), 1960s Italy (The Green Helmet), Brighton (Under Suspicion), Renaissance Italy (Dr Who), even China (Danger Man). But the two television series that really secured Portmeirion's place in the popular British imagination were 1960s sci-fi drama The Prisoner (with the village making an eerily jovial setting for the Kafkaesque story), and the more recent Cold Feet, the romantic comedy series whose final episode in 2003 turned Portmeirion into a popular wedding venue overnight.

“Clough did not like the idea of Portmeirion being in any way a sterile museum of architecture,” Llywelyn said. “He wanted the place to inspire people to be creative in their own right, be that as artists, writers, poets, musicians, even architects – and for the whole place to provide pleasure and make people happy.""

The village certainly continues to make me happy and I find it difficult to imagine life without the occasional visit. Quite why it has such an impact is based, I think, in the fact that Williams-Ellis fought for beauty all his life, considering it a “strange necessity”. And it is because his family have held on to this idea of beauty – in whatever form it comes – that Portmeirion continues to reinvent itself and go from strength to strength.",null,0,null,1433442662,null,0,false,0,crvkr10,null,t3_38jt6x,null,t1_crvkr10,null,t1_crvkhs4,null,null,null,1437572069,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

Also, indirect intention murder is a bit of a shaky subject, the prosecution is sometimes reluctant to pursue under this law especially if there is a lack of credible evidence that he truly wanted to cause such a high level of harm.

Clearly there needs to be a law to protect the vulnerable from the vicious. 

But many commenters here are cheering on heavy prison sentences for actions that may well have caused no harm at all. 

It is a reasonable question as to how much evidence of actual harm there is in cases where the younger person appears to be a willing participant. Does more harm result from the public shaming than the relationship itself?

There is rather obviously greater potential for harm of young girls by older men than of younger boys by older women. (Because men are typically larger, more prone to violence, and a host of other obvious reasons.)

I am not suggesting there should be no punishment.  I am suggesting that prison sentences are heavy here, and that there is no obvious equivalence between boys and girls.

null,false,CharlieDeBeadle,null,null,null,"In case you were wondering:  
Hannah has n sweets in a bag, 6 of which are orange. The probability of picking 2 orange sweets in a row is 1/3.  
The probability of picking an orange sweet at random is the number of orange sweets, divided by the total number of sweets. Hopefully this is familiar to you, so the probability of picking _one_ orange sweet is 6/n.  
Now, assuming she's just picked an orange sweet (which is required, if you want to pick two of them) there are now 1 less sweet in the bag, so the number of sweets is now n-1. There is also only 5 orange sweets. Using these numbers, the probability of picking the second orange sweet is 5/(n-1).  
To work out the probability of two things both happening, you multiply their respective probabilities. The probability of picking the first orange sweet is 6/n, and the probability of THEN picking a second is 5/(n-1). Multiply them:  

    (6 / n) x (5 / (n - 1))
    (6 x 5) / (n x (n - 1))
    30 / n2 - n
    
Now we know, 30/n^(2)-n is the probability of picking two orange sweets in a row. We also know that the probability is 1/3, as it says in the question.  

    30 / n2 - n = 1 / 3
    90 / n2 - n = 1 (multiply it all by 3, 3 x 30 = 90)
    90 = n2 - n (multiply it all by n2 - n)
    0 = n2 - n - 90 (subtract 90)

Offence is subjective. I'm not a cake decorator, quite the opposite, but if I was and someone wanted me to make a ""9/11 was funny"" cake would I be equally wrong for not making it if i refused on the grounds of it being offensive? 
If ""support gay marriage"" is offensive to one baker and they refuse to put it on a cake, and ""9/11 was funny"" was offensive to me and i refuse to put it on a cake, then why should it be OK for me, but not them?

Clearly ""9/11 was funny"" would be fine to refuse, but what if i really didn't like animals, especially dogs? ""Dogs are cute"" could be offensive to some people, fuck knows why but it's possible, would it be morally wrong to refuse to put that on a cake? It could be something i disagree with and don't want to be promoting the idea that dogs are cute when i disagree with it, but i doubt this would produce the kind of outrage as these bakers did for refusing to put a message on their cake they disagreed with, and didn't want to be seen to promote.

So the gay rights side of this argument is moronic, but what about the religious rights side? 

Well, this is just as stupid. Decorating a cake to order does not imply endorsement of whatever message the customer wants to put on that cake. Obviously. So, a hypothetical: Two customers each want a cake decorated. One wants ""Happy birthday, Mark"" and the other wants ""Have a horrible birthday, Mark"". If you refuse to make the 'support gay marriage' cake decoration because you don't want to be seen to promote the movement then to remain consistent you must refuse the custom of one of these two customers with opposing messages for Mark.

Obviously that wouldn't happen though, and the cake decorator would make both decorations because it's clearly the customer and not the decorator that is wishing people have happy or horrible birthdays.


So what is my judgement on this case? Everyone involved are fucking morons. If you want to refuse someone's custom for stupid reasons, fine. You're a fucking idiot and good luck maintaining custom when you refuse to decorate a wedding cake for an interracial couple because ""oh, mah beliefs. God put us on separate continents for a reason,... blah... blah"". And as for you, just find another fucking cake decorator you perpetually offended cunt. Now GTFO of my court.

&gt;Four were hedge funds (three of them based in the US), not exactly known for sticking with businesses through thick and thin. The three US hedge funds have not hung around – they’ve cashed in and are long gone.

&gt;Another member of the 16 to have left the share register is Lazard Asset Management or LAM. Now, read this carefully: LAM is the investment division of Lazard, the Government’s adviser on... the Royal Mail sell-off. LAM made an £8 million profit from selling its allocation.
&gt;Lazard helped the Government to set that controversial 330p offer price. Alan Custis, head of UK equities at LAM, had a different figure in mind for what the Royal Mail shares were worth: he said 395p. That was his “target price”, after which he’d think about selling. In fact, such was the speed of the rise, he sold out at 470p.

&gt; Of course, there is no way on earth that one arm of Lazard knew what the other was thinking. They have Chinese walls for that sort of thing. And don’t even begin to imagine that William Rucker and his team at Lazard were capable of executing the same arithmetic as their colleague, Custis.

All totally legit. But wait, let's have a look at the shining reputation of some of those other investors in more detail shall we. There's the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority:

It's possible the plan is to give Terry another full season (or however long he can keep going) with Cahill alongside him (because Cahill would likely leave if he wasn't a first choice player and losing a very capable homegrown player would be bad for the team) and a new player in on the bench and then bringing him back next season or whenever Terry is no longer going to be playing most matches.

If this happens I see it as a half-step towards rebuilding the defence into a younger and more forward-thinking new form. Zouma has played a bit at CB and a bit in midfield but if Mourinho's planning on getting a new defensive midfielder and CB for the future then Zouma wouldn't necessarily see a lot of game time. By going on loan he gets more experience (especially useful in Italy which is very tactical and disciplined) and won't complain about a lack of game time. If that's how it happened it could work out best for everyone in the long-term. I really think Mourinho is thinking three or more years in the future right now. He wants to win titles in the present of course but he's also looking forward and building a team that can last. I can't see him selling Zouma but I can see him being loaned out for a season if it means bringing a new option into the mix and getting him some more valuable experience.",null,0,null,1433446057,null,0,false,0,crvmywr,null,t3_38hxpx,null,t1_crvmywr,null,t1_crviked,null,null,null,1436730739,null,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2,null

After all, we could just ban everything that's not discussion, but then people who want to see the creation-side of Doctor Who fandom wouldn't see it here.
Fans come in all shapes, sizes, wants and needs. Just because they want to make art and you want to discuss doesn't make your opinion any more (or less, for that matter) important than theirs (and to call them not fans of the show is a dick move).

We've tried to get a good balance by removing low-effort and/or unrelated content (although this was more about preventing such material from drowning out HQ/Important content) but there's no pleasing everyone. Every day we see another post or comment somewhere complaining about something to do with the subreddit.

Be the change that you wish to see in the world. If you don't wish to do this, you're welcome to also go elsewhere, but posting yet another post complaining without giving any ideas helps no one.

In Lille he was mostly playing centre forward in a 4-3-1-2, but when you watch some of his games, or just look on the heatmaps from them, you will see why that similarity with Sturridge comes to mind. He is really fluid player moving on a large area of the pitch, covering both flanks and area before the goal, really getting into combinations and sometimes missing in the final stage. He surely isn't such a poacher as healthy Sturridge is, but there is a lot of space for improving in there. 

Of course, it will depends on Rodgers how he will use him and how are we gonna develop him. I would use him like that false 9 kind of player, fluid striker in order to improve his combination play and of course goal scoring. However, I am afraid that he will be putted on the wing, playing the typical winger, in that case there is really a little chance that he will glitter and that we will get the best of him.

&gt; The foreign customers who visit our markets are not brought hither through fear of the power or the influence of British diplomatists: they are not captured by our fleets and armies: and as little are they attracted by feelings of love for us; for that ""there is no friendship in trade"" is a maxim equally applicable to nations and to individuals. 

&gt;It is solely from the promptings of self-interest that the merchants of Europe, as of the rest of the world, send their ships to our ports to be freighted with the products of our labour.

&gt;The self-same impulse drew all nations, at different periods of history, to Tyre, to Venice, and to Amsterdam; and if, in the revolution of time and events, a country should be found (which is probable) whose cottons and woollens shall be cheaper than those of England and the rest of the world, then to that spot—even should it, by supposition, be buried in the remotest nook of the globe—will all the traders of the earth flock; and no human power, no fleets or armies, will prevent Manchester, Liverpool, and Leeds, from sharing the fate of their once proud predecessors in Holland, Italy, and Phœnicia.

There are many things you can do to raise the quality of this sub. For instance, /r/StarWars has days where - unless its of very importance - you can't post links. Basically discussion only days. You can do what tons of other mods do on other subs, and remove low quality posts - and I mean low quality, not just extremely low quality. You can create ""containment"" subs, like one dedicated for arts and crafts, so on the main sub we get news and discussion.

You can have dedicated days for certain types of posts, such as having 3 days a week be discussion only and 4 days be everything.

Here is a long-winded summary of what will/can/cannot happen, and what you can do.

You have a 14 day cooling-off period, beginning the day after you placed the order, in which to cancel the order or service in line with Distance Selling Regulations. If this time period has elapsed, you cannot exit the contract without incurring the full cessation charge and a mandatory £30 disconnection fee.

You have said that you moved into a new estate, where issues with a first line provide wouldn't be uncommon. If the issue is with Openreach getting the line installed, then they have a certain amount of days to get it fixed and provide the line (this is 3 full working days for a normal fault, but I can't remember off the top of my head whether it is the same for new lines). After this time period you are entitled to be refunded the rental charges for each day that you go without service. You are also entitled to a £10 refund for each missed engineer appointment.

Even though you haven't been provided with the service yet, this does not entitle you to leave the contract without being held to term, nor is the contract void; it simply means that BT cannot force you to pay for the services for the amount of time that they aren't being provided. This will be the case with all other providers, and will be the main position you will come up against when making any complaints regarding this. You will find this as being in line with Ofcom guidelines, and legally sound - as unfair as this might be in a lot of situations.

If the issue is indeed with Openreach, then there is very little that BT can do to expedite the situation. BT Group plc. may own Openreach, but since Openreach is a ring-fenced company BT are at the mercy of the Openreach engineers to get the problem solved, like all other service providers that use Openreach lines.

The main issue here seems to be your point about BT making no effort to resolve the problem. If this is the case, then it is here that the company is doing something wrong.

My advice is as follows:

Ensure that a fault has been raised on your account. There will be a ""next action date"" attached to the fault, at which point they should call you with an update. Ask when the next action date is. The faults teams are based in India, and are utterly abysmal in terms of customer service, especially with honouring callbacks. If you aren't getting anywhere, don't bother going in circles with them for too long.

Try posting your issue on the official BT Community forum. A moderator there will usually provide you with a link to a form to fill in, and this results in your issue being passed to a customer resolutions specialist based in Enniskillen, who are usually excellent at resolving the issue as fast and as best they can. They will case-manage the issue for you and keep in regular contact via phone, or failing this via email.

Failing this, the final step would be to send an email to Gavin Patterson, the CEO of BT Group - gavin.patterson@bt.com. This isn't his real email address - issues emailed here are automatically distributed to an Executive Level Complaints (ELC) advisor, who will normally be based in Belfast, Doncaster or Canterbury. These teams work on behalf of the chairman, and have the power and authority to perform almost any action with your account, including large compensation payments, heavily discounted price plans and more direct numbers to Openreach personnel.

Once the problem is resolved, if you find that the resolution/refund/service etc. was not acceptable to you, then you can raise a case with the Communications Ombudsman. For this you will usually need a BT manager to issue you with a ""deadlock letter"", which is a written statement of the company's final position on the matter.",null,0,null,1433448458,null,0,1433448910,0,crvoiup,null,t3_38i9bx,null,t1_crvoiup,null,t3_38i9bx,null,null,null,1437571922,null,12,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,12,null

She's probably referring to the top rate of tax which currently is only 50%, [but has previously been as high as 98%](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_the_United_Kingdom#Modern_rules). Tax bands work such that you only pay the associated tax rate on earnings over the threshold for that band; you only pay the top rate on earnings over £150,000 (your first £10,600 is tax free, you're taxed 20% on earnings between £10,600 and £31,786, 40% between £31,786 and £150,000, 50% on anything over). So realistically probably anyone paying the top rate of tax could afford for that rate to be higher unless they were living a phenomenally lavish lifestyle with very high outgoings.

1) We have no idea how many more years Terry can perform at this level. He looked fantastic this year, like arguably the best CB in the entire PL. There's a significant amount of room to fall from that perch before Mourinho and his meritocracy would remove him from the starting line-up, IMO.

2) we have plenty of talented players loaned out. One commonality with a lot of them is being unsure of how much playing time they'll actually get while on loan. I'm not sure we really want Zouma going to a physicality-above-all team in a wide open league like Serie A. So where does he even go where we'll be sure he comes back with more experience as opposed to a year arguably stunting his growth, where he could've been getting even more in sync with our players? 

3) We still need greater depth within the club to avoid a second-half drop in form. Why do we keep sending people out, while City maintains (for instance) for strikers on their books? I don't agree that, simply because he'll get more playing time elsewhere, that he won't get enough opportunity to grow with us next year. We feel off this year in the second half, and that was even after doing out of two major competitions.

MLAs from Sinn Fein, the SDLP and the Green Party aren't talking about the fact that two-thirds of benefits claimants will be better off, or no worse off, if Universal Credit is implemented here.

In fact, they're preventing 102,000 households from receiving, on average, £37 per week more.

Welfare reform has never been about cuts and the truth is it will actually benefit Northern Ireland immensely.

The bill is based on three very important principles: helping the most vulnerable in our society, delivering fairness for taxpayers and getting people into work.

There's nothing compassionate about parking families on benefits, with few aspirations and little chance of escape.

The Welfare Bill ensures that help is targeted to the people who need it most. It guarantees a fairer deal for taxpayers by ensuring that benefits are capped at a generous total of £26,000 per year.

Perhaps most importantly, Universal Credit gives people an incentive to get into work, because it makes sure entering employment doesn't mean benefits are suddenly cut altogether.

These are commonsense measures, which are only controversial when political debate enters the realms of fantasy.

At Stormont, the petition of concern, a mechanism devised to stop sectarianism, has been abused so that parties can veto anything they like.

The debate around welfare reform has demonstrated that the people of Northern Ireland are being let down by politicians, as well as the expensive industry of quangos, union bosses and pressure groups surrounding them, who have lost touch with reality.

null,false,DeusBex,null,null,null,"&gt; The trick is not to bring your preconceptions with you

That very opening line seems so stupid, especially when politics is dictated by preconceptions. The very fact that the Conservatives are even running an EU referendum just proves that they are pandering to preconceptions rather than what is good for the country, as I would personally prefer a government to do. 

&gt; What kind of Conservative government is David Cameron actually leading now? It says something about the blurriness of our second-term prime minister that, even after nearly a decade leading his party, answers to this question still vary so radically.

Are they completely forgetting the fact that this is his first term as a Prime Minister in which his party have outright power? For better or for worse, the ""blurriness"" of the last government was because it was formed from two different parties with ultimately two different ideologies. 

&gt; Take the hugely important issue of the health service. Labour still insists that it sees a government set on privatising the NHS. But they are simply wrong. Jeremy Hunt is essentially managing what he has inherited. He is not making the mistakes that his predecessor, Andrew Lansley, made. But that’s about all. There is no radical reform plan from the government. The NHS will still be very recognisably there in 2020 at the next election, better in some ways, worse in others, but still generally venerated.

We're in the first few weeks of government. We can hardly declare, simply because there has yet to have been any, that there will be no further NHS privatisation. In fact, unless the Conservatives fill their pledge to plug the funding gap which was cited during the election as around £8 billion, then I'd wager that there will nonetheless still be issues. To suggest that the NHS will continue to operate as is current, with total disregard for issues like the ageing population, is stupid. Also, although this is perhaps just me, I don't class the current situation as ideal. It's good, sure, but I want an ever-improving NHS. Mental healthcare is one area in particular which could be improved.

&gt; When he says he wants the economy to work for everyone, or to bring people together, cut him some slack and allow that he means it.

It would be possible to believe him, but only if his previous actions hadn't absolutely proven the contrary to this. The economy doesn't ""work for everyone"" if, within the first few weeks of government, housing and the disabled are attacked. The economy is evidently not working for the one million people relying on food banks to simply survive.

&gt; Part of the problem of trying to understand Cameron is that he does not impose as leader. He is a half-hearted party manager. As a result, even now, he tends to hold a loose rein. His all-Tory government is itself a coalition, as they always are. But since it stretches from a very Hayekian libertarian, like the new business secretary, Sajid Javid, with his admiration for Ayn Rand, to a more traditionally social liberal like the education secretary, Nicky Morgan, it is all too easy for observers to pick and choose the piece of evidence that suits a predetermined case but misses the messier big picture.

Excuse me, but wasn't Ed attacked during the election for not having a statesman-like appearance? Apparently when Cameron doesn't have a firm grip on his party as one would expect from a leader, however, that is okay. Also, although I will admit there are some fantastic MPs in the Conservative Party, we cannot attach terms like ""libertarian"" or liberalism to a party which within weeks announces plans for internet snooping.

&gt; This government will be remembered for the way it handles three issues: Europe, the (UK) union and public spending. All three are to some extent problems of the Tory party’s own creation, all made more difficult and dangerous as a result of decisions for which Cameron must take responsibility. On the first two, however, Cameron’s position – for staying in the EU and in favour of devolution to strengthen the union – is not just popular but right. On the last, government austerity spending to see off the fiscal deficit, his policy has just been upheld, sort of, at the election.

The union will not be strengthened with a Conservative government, which has a track history of introducing policies that are detrimental or simply unpopular to Scotland/Wales. That's not a personal failing, as they are ultimately the Conservative Party, but to suggest that they'll be the saving grace for the union seems a little stupid to me. Also, he's the very reason that we're at risk from leaving the EU in the first place!",null,1,null,1433449540,null,0,false,0,crvp87g,null,t3_38kbin,null,t1_crvp87g,null,t3_38kbin,null,null,null,1436732641,null,-6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-6,null

I looked into the Arb idea but there are conflicted reports as to whether you can still hang around and have a drink etc on there without being moved on by the fuzz, especially if we end up as a decent sized group. Also it may be a bit of a concern for people to rock up to an unsupervised area to meet strangers / almost strangers for those coming along from the last one.


If the weather is good make it an afternoon start and see where it takes us. If it's naff perhaps make it an evening start (seven-ish like last time), nobody really fancies sitting around waiting for people who won't be braving the rain and thunder.

I'm leaning towards non-Brewdog seeing as we've already done that, unless there's an overwhelming desire to go to Brewdog). Thinking walking distance of the city centre with a potential to move the party somewhere else if the mood takes us. The Organ Grinder would be a decent idea for a starting point though it's a bit of a walk from the centre - interesting selection of drinks even for teetotallers, bar snacks etc. Might be a bit less rammed than Brewdog was too and for /u/twistedlucidity it claims to be dog friendly. It leaves us a couple of options within a very short walk (Hand and Heart, Sir John Borlase Warren) and town in reach if we're bored of Canning Circus. Alternatively the Lincolnshire Poacher , a tad small but cozy, good beer and whisky lineup, can sit outside in little beach huts and park in the back room / conservatory for indoor space. That gives us moving-on options of Fade, Orange Tree and a couple of other Mansfield Road delights too. Both options keep us a step away from the market square-on-saturdays pandemonium too, always a bonus.

I know just going to the pub again might not be the most exotic of summer meet up ideas but it's hard to really plan for *Activities* given the nature of the job.

Equality is what we need. She should have been sentenced according to the crime not her gender. But no need to react like this about it. Any rational person would want her sentenced properly - both men or women. No need to hate on women just cause this one happens to be fucking evil.

This is the Ed Miliband who knew that Ed Ball's constituency was in trouble and *didn't tell him*, because he quite liked the idea of him losing and appointing someone else as Chancellor. A better, more honest man would have done a reshuffle and also helped save Ed Balls' seat. Because that's how you deal with someone you want to demote. You are upfront and straight and you don't sacrifice seats.

The bit about Miliband knowing Balls was in trouble comes from the following article:

http://www.spectator.co.uk/features/9528312/inside-the-milibunker-the-last-days-of-ed-did-ed-miliband-sacrifice-ed-balls/

&gt;Another MP said: ‘The polling was the most sensitive part of the operation. That’s because it was the polling that showed Ed’s personal ratings. So they kept it very, very tight. Only about four or five people in Ed’s office had access to it and they didn’t like sharing it outside Ed’s team. In fact, it would be circulated in a way that meant those people would hold back bits of data from each other.’

&gt;This failure to compile or share accurate data proved catastrophic. In Yorkshire, hundreds of activists were deployed to Sheffield Hallam in an attempt to ‘decapitate’ Nick Clegg. But half an hour down the road was Morley and Outwood, the seat of Ed Balls. In the final days of the 2010 campaign, Balls telephoned an MP friend. ‘I’ve just had Alicia Kennedy [Labour’s deputy general secretary] on,’ said Balls. ‘She says I might be in trouble in my seat and I should get back there. What do you think?’

&gt;‘Get back there now,’ his friend said. Balls did and clung on by 1,101 votes.

&gt;This time, no call arrived. There are some in the Balls camp who think that was no accident. ‘The leader’s office had the polling data, and they sat on it,’ a Balls ally told me. ‘They knew what was happening nationally two weeks out, they knew what that meant for Ed’s seat. And they sat on it.’ The implication is that Miliband thought he would run a minority government after an election that might depose his shadow chancellor. And that he considered this no bad thing.

Also regarding Sheffield Hallam, the LibDems spent a third of their budget defending Clegg as a result of the decapitation strategy - if there was no decapitation threat, they'd have spent it defending their seats in the South West which would have meant the Tories wouldn't have picked up as many and perhaps wouldn't have got an overall majority.

So Miliband is a mix of Machiavellian and not being able to think of the consequences of his own decisions. Fatal in a multi-party election like this one.

Secondly, you can buy the car back from the insurer and fix it yourself, which you'll likely find a lot cheaper than the insurers can do it.  If you really want to keep the motor, you can do this.

The government currently pay £45 billion annually on it's debt of ~£1.5 trillion. £1.5 billion off the debt would therefore net us £45 million annually in savings and those savings (which show up just the same as profits when your cutting the deficit) would be guaranteed in the long run (as long as there is not a flurry of borrowing in the foreseeable future) whereas Royal Mail can go bust at any moment taking £1.5 billion of taxpayers money with it. 

Royal Mail's core business is still loss making IIRC. It's only very recently that Royal Mail has been significantly profitable and who knows what will happen in the future. [In 2010 RM only made £39 million profit](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a6489e86-9682-11e0-afc5-00144feab49a.html#axzz3c83yPRE6) across the entire group and made a £120 million loss in it's core business. It's facing heavy competition from courier services and automated, electronic forms of sending mail, files and documentation which can have electronic signatures on them etc now. There's just less need for a mail service on the scale of RM. However as the only universal provider they may be forced to keep up those less profitable routes by the government, again eating into the profits and thus the returns the government might get by continuing to own 30% of the business. 

Better to avoid the uncertainties of a competitive market and make sustainable savings by cutting the debt now.

null,false,whitefalconiv,smith,Smith,null,"Here's the thing; There are basically two types of fans.  There are curative and transformative fans.

Curative fans, like you, find their joy in the fandom by discussing, studying, and ""purifying"" the original work.  Debates over what is and is not canon, picking apart foreshadowing, finding callbacks and references inside the work itself, things like that are curative.  You'r ""curating"" the work, much like a museum would do with artifacts and artwork.  And yes, this includes posts of funny quotes from the show over top a screencap of the show.  Curating a funny bit is no different.

Then you have transformative fans.  These are the fans that find joy in using the work to create more things, to bring the fandom to life for them.  Fanart, fanfiction, baking cakes, crocheting, cosplay, anything like that is transformative, they're transforming the work into something of their own, putting their energy into creation rather than curation.

There's always going to be some overlap.  A curator can enjoy a good knitted TARDIS blanket or a particularly well-drawn Dalek, just like a transformer can enjoy picking apart the minutiae of what tone of voice the Doctor addresses Clara in and what it really means.  And many people are fans of both the show AND the actors so you have that to consider as well.

Doctor Who, for whatever reason, attracts more transformative fans.  I've found that if a fandom is big on tumblr, it tends to be more transformative, and DW is one of the ""Big 3"" fandoms on tumblr (Supernatural, Doctor Who, and Sherlock).  The majority of the Doctor Who fandom, unless it's a specifically curation-focused community like /r/gallifrey, is going to be transformative, ESPECIALLY between seasons.

Shows like Star Trek have more curators these days, I'd say largely because it's been around so long (and been off the air for quite some time) that the transformative fans have gotten bored, or something about the show prompts fans to curate more than transform.

The MAIN part of the Doctor Who fandom is not the kind of fan you are, and there is a place for you, in /r/gallifrey.  Seriously, spend your time there, discuss and curate to your heart's content, learn all the theories and callbacks and things you've missed, then when the show is back on, and there are discussion threads for current episodes, you'll be MUCH more useful of a contributor here in the main sub.  This IS the DW fandom.  It's splintered and fractured and full of shitposts and shitty cakes and stuffed daleks and ""look who I met!"" posts and SO many of us eat that shit up because that's the kind of people this show attracts more of.

null,false,pcjonathan,smith,Smith,null,"&gt;For instance, /r/StarWars has days where - unless its of very importance - you can't post links. Basically discussion only days. 

I recall this being raised a few times in the very distant past, especially before I got here. I'll float it in a bit with the rest of the mods, but I can't see it doing a lot of good in our present low-activity state. All it would be doing is removing content.

Lets look at the past day as an example. In the past 24 hours, there have been 12 posts, so an average of every two hours, 9 of which have been links. All of those discussion posts are currently in /hot and have had plenty of opportunity to be seen and commented upon. Since the purpose of making it discussion-only would be simply removing everything non-discussion, that would mean there'd been only 3 discussion posts, 1 of which is this one. There'd be no more opportunity to add a discussion thread then there would be at any other time. If people have a thread in mind, then they're not going to wait until the day to do it. The only real difference there is, relatively, a lot of posts have been removed, causing disenchantment within the user-base.

When the subreddit is more active, perhaps during mid-series, I could see it having much more of an effect and therefore be worthwhile, but not when we're faced with an average of 10-14 posts a day. In contrast, /r/StarWars has had 87 posts in the past 24 hours, where there's much more opportunity for discussion posts to be lost.

Remember, discussion-only is used to focus on discussion when there's a storm of other posts. /r/DoctorWho's problem is not focusing on it, but rather generating more of it.

&gt;You can do what tons of other mods do on other subs, and remove low quality posts - and I mean low quality, not just extremely low quality.

But quality is a very subjective thing. Who decides? In our moderator team alone, we have differing opinions on things. The subreddit userbase's range is immense. To use an example, one of our moderators removed something that can easily be described as ""very low quality"" about a month ago. Within a few hours, despite it being no longer listed, our modmail received several complaints with titles such as ""Abuse of Power"", ""Overmoderation"", etc and the removal comment was downvoted over 15 times with lots of replies. Obviously some people disagreed.

Where should the line be drawn on such things? If the downvote button cannot be used for posts that are low quality or posts that add little-to-nothing, including low quality discussion posts, why is it there in the first place?

&gt;You can create ""containment"" subs, like one dedicated for arts and crafts, so on the main sub we get news and discussion.

But where do we stop? If we create containment subreddits for everything, we might as well turn /r/DoctorWho into a list and close it down. Why should the creative side of the fandom be banned from the subreddit while the intellectuals do what they want? 

Besides, there already are plenty of ""containment"" subreddits for all sections of the fandom, be it /r/Gallifrey, /r/ImaginaryGallifrey, /r/DoctorWhumour, /r/BigFinish, etc. Hell, one could even argue that we'd be better off containing news and discussion because /r/Gallifrey has already been long-established. Obviously, that would be wrong too.

Think about it this way. Let's assume that the current market price of RBS is 80p. That means that everyone in the world who values RBS shares at *more* than 80p has already bought them - there is not a single buyer left who will pay a higher price.

So all the other people in the world value RBS shares at 80p or less. Most of them value RBS shares at a lot less than 80p, but a few will give you 80p for them.

So, if you have millions of RBS shares, you sell as many as you can to the people who value them at 80p - great! But there are only a few of them, and they only have so much money to spend on RBS shares, so pretty soon they stop buying, and you still have millions of RBS shares left. What do you do? Well, you can go and find the people who value RBS shares at 79p. They'll probably buy a few thousand off you, but again, pretty soon they've bought all they want, and you have to go to the people who only value RBS at 78p... etc.

It's exactly what we need, an opposition that tries to appeal to the sane side of the Tories, rather than just barking at them.

[It probably helped that before hand the Tories themselves offered some kind (if hypocritical) words](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jun/04/ed-miliband-returns-to-the-commons-with-speech-on-inequality):
&gt;Speaking before Miliband, Osborne paid tribute to the former Labour leader’s integrity, despite the Conservatives having mounted a highly personal campaign against his character. At one point during the election campaign, Michael Fallon, the defence secretary, suggested Miliband would stab the country in the back, having stabbed his brother in the back over the Labour leadership.

&gt;Osborne told the Commons: “Sincerely, it is very good the former leader of the Labour party is here. I think he earns the respect of everyone that he has come to this house so soon after the election defeat.

&gt;“Whatever the fierce argument of the general election, I don’t think anyone ever doubted his personal integrity or the conviction with which he made his argument and it is good to see him back in the chamber.”

&gt;The former chancellor Ken Clarke also praised Miliband’s performance and said it had nothing to do with Labour’s defeat. 

&gt;“It causes me at times a slight annoyance to find that in the leadership election that’s broken out in the Labour party, some of those people who were a month ago his greatest admirers, his most loyal colleagues, closest to his cause, are now busily detaching themselves and attempting to scapegoat him for the problems that the Labour movement experienced,” he said.

&gt;“My opinion, for what it’s worth, is Mr Miliband fought a very good election campaign and actually it was much better than anybody expected because of the tabloid press and the expectations they had raised.

&gt;“I thought he put the message across very well, I thought the message was wrong and that was the judgment of the majority of constituents in my constituency and in my part of the world. It is not the case that somehow his performance has anything to do with the result.”",null,0,null,1433452924,null,0,false,0,crvrdyf,null,t3_38iudw,null,t1_crvrdyf,null,t1_crvnmi4,null,null,null,1436734161,null,17,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,17,null

I think the greens should be deepening their relationship with the labour movement. Working with trade unions and encouraging workplace organising. Supporting and initiating protests and action by groups. My main issue with the greens is their lack of connection to the labour movement, something that the labour party (despite its many faults) does have. Without a strong labour/working class/anti-austerity movement that is willing to be part of the struggle against the current political/economic/social consensus then it doesn't really matter who's in power. Without a base that a progressive party is rooted in they will almost certainly falter when they come to any sort of power. They will need that support and pressure. At the moment we don't have that sort of movement, or rather we do have these movements, but they need growing. And I think that's the most important thing at the moment, and that the greens priority should be growing them. Elections are exciting and everything, but grassroots organising of workers and communities is constant work, that isn't always fun. Coincidentally I think that this type of stuff will help in elections, but we have to avoid making it seem like just voting greens in will solve the problems, it will require people to be part of the movement (not necessarily the party, but trade union/anti-austerity) for any left party to succeed at all.

I suppose people would say ""then open a cake shop that will serve gay people, drive them out of business"", which is a fair point. But the point of these laws is to protect people in extreme cases, so lets push it out a bit more: if the country was 99% opposed to homosexuality, and a pro-gay person tried to open a bakery, it would be doomed to fail immediately due to small target market, so still no place for that 1% to get a cake. Would it still be OK for all the other bakeries to deny service? The person would be denied any access to the service in their own country just because the majority hold a certain belief.

I don't even really have an answer, this is just my general reason for not so quickly dismissing their case. It's a tricky one, I want to believe that the shop shouldn't be forced, but I'm against a situation where if a belief is held by enough people it would deny a minority any access to certain services at all...

null,false,studavis,flare-brum,Black Country,null,"New Street - nice and easy.

To be fair, there's lots of places in around New Street of varying degrees of quality and suitability.

My suggestion would be to get down John Bright Street. Down there you have Brewdog, Cherry Reds and The Victoria. You don't say what time you will be starting but it's very vibrant down there from around midday on Saturdays. Brewdog offers a selection of very strong beers, but can be pricey - you won't find 90% of what they sell anywhere else though. Cherry Reds has an uber relaxed vibe with a small but well chosen selection of eclectic beers, but is a bit of a warren with it's many rooms (though plenty of chance to go unnoticed). The Vic does wicked cocktails and ales and has a fairly relaxed vibe but can be a bit up it's own arse at times (note to The Vic, you aren't *that* good my friends). You can also pop round the corner to Island bar for a few more cocktails if that's your thing - try and visit when it's happy hour as the cocktails are probably some of the best in Brum, try the 'Corpse Reviver' and try and stay upright.

At that point you also have the numerous 'trendy but relaxed' pubs that seem to be popping up in the centre. Pure Bar is very relaxed, can get busy, but is sort of a more pubby Brewdog - nice building too. The Lost and Found is fine but can get very busy, is in a huge building and not sure how suitable it would be for a single person - again predominantly a cocktail and food (which is overrated in there btw) place. They've just opened Cozy Club over the road from there too, which is a sort of a bar that caters for the Harborne types, so no pressure and loads of retro chintz - but a decent vibe nonetheless - gets busy post 7pm though.

If you just want some ale, the get to the Wellington (on the same road). Huge selection, but can be pricey and you do get the real ale bores in there constantly. They seemed to have controlled their prices recently though, which is a good thing. Also, the Post Office Vaults, just outside the New St entrance is owned by the same people who own the Welly - it's all underground, but has the best selection of real cider in Brum City Centre and also the best World beers selection I've seen probably anywhere in a pub outside London. Can get very busy in there purely because of its size. Not one for claustrophobics.

Failing that, if you want to get smashed, there is the Wetherspoons just off New Street - usual fair of a Wetherspoons but busy and no pressure, so very easy to pop in for a quiet drink by yourself.

I'll float it in a bit with the rest of the mods, but I can't see it doing a lot of good in our present low-activity state. All it would be doing is removing content.
Lets look at the past day as an example. In the past 24 hours, there have been 12 posts, so an average of every two hours, 9 of which have been links. All of those discussion posts are currently in /hot and have had plenty of opportunity to be seen and commented upon. Since the purpose of making it discussion-only would be simply removing everything non-discussion, that would mean there'd been only 3 discussion posts, 1 of which is this one. There'd be no more opportunity to add a discussion thread then there would be at any other time. If people have a thread in mind, then they're not going to wait until the day to do it. The only real difference there is, relatively, a lot of posts have been removed, causing disenchantment within the user-base.

Most of this is based on the assumption that

1. Today is typical, and 

2. People won't post more if these changes are made.

I think its reasonably likely that if big changes are made to this sub, designed to cut off some of the fat and replace it with good stuff, more people will post. At least likely enough to try. I don't know how common this is, but I know that I and some of my friends stopped posting and going on this sub because we were discouraged by the level of crap. It's not far-fetched to think that if you make large changes to the sub, a lot of the people who basically gave up on this place might come back. Again, I'm not certain, but I think its worth experimenting with.

I also happen to believe in quality &gt; quantity. I would be fine with  fewer posts if the average quality of those posts goes up considerably.



&gt;But quality is a very subjective thing. Who decides? In our moderator team alone, we have differing opinions on things. The subreddit userbase's range is immense. To use an example, one of our moderators removed something that can easily be described as ""very low quality"" about a month ago. Within a few hours, despite it being no longer listed, our modmail received several complaints with titles such as ""Abuse of Power"", ""Overmoderation"", etc and the removal comment was downvoted over 15 times with lots of replies. Obviously some people disagreed.

Well you need to use your best judgement and simply withstand the negative feedback. People are going to be upset that their wedding cake post was deleted, I know. But I suspect - based on the response to my post - that the majority in this sub wants less of that shit. Again, I am not certain, but its worth trying out.

&gt;But where do we stop? If we create containment subreddits for everything, we might as well turn /r/DoctorWho into a list and close it down. Why should the creative side of the fandom be banned from the subreddit while the intellectuals do what they want?

Slippery slope fallacy. First of all, I was never suggesting you do all of the things I listed. It might be sufficient to have just a few containment subs and have less moderation on /r/doctorwho. Or it might be sufficient to have specialized posting days and forgo the containment subs. I'm not suggesting you do all of those at once.

Onto the fallacy, its silly to think that because you set up 3 or 4 containment subs, we'll eventually be forced to set up tons. I could easily see there being 4 ""official"" subs: /r/doctorwho, /r/gallifrey, /r/imaginarygallifrey, and some arts-and-crafts specific sub. I think that could work.

Basically what I'm suggesting is the mods just try some of these things. Do some specialized days, see if that works. Delete more low-quality content, see if that works. Create containment subs, see if that works. Experiment.

Come on, that's a complete cop out. NI is subject to British anti-discrimination laws, so it is entirely possible for them to be 99% opposed to something passed by Westminster.

Also I imagine a gay person could go to ECHR to force an equality law even if not popular.

It is funny, because the demand that someone would only pay higher taxes if it meant better services is not logically far from people who want lower taxes because of ideological reasons about their preferred size of the state, or simply because they don't like how their tax is being spent somehow. Pretty sure hating seeing your money wasted or misused by others is a universal human trait. Let me know when someone finds a government which doesn't spend some of their money in a way they disapprove of.

Honestly though, what is it about financially secure, generous or fortunate individuals declaring they would happily pay more if it meant we ALL had better services looking after us that riles so many people into making this snarky response? 

If there are economic reasons against higher taxes, fine, that is perhaps looking out for the greater good and long-term prosperity in a different way.

Manufactured goods start to get cheaper when you sell them in bulk. There are all sorts of economies of scale. Bulk goods only need to be designed once, so that's massively cheaper right there. Then mass production is a huge saving. Then distribution - it's much cheaper to ship whole container loads of things around than it is to ship items individually.

With Carroll they understood that if they just stopped the crosses they could stop Carroll so they pressed the wide men, but with Benteke's other skills they can't completely wipe out his supply of chances. Benteke's also quicker than he gets credit for.

While I'm not a huge fan of the charter, there's no denying in my eyes that parts of it are necessary.  RIPA was designed in a different era.  If you want the police to be able to solve internet based crime on a large scale, they need some of these powers.

Let me give you an example. You've been hacked by somebody.  The only clue you have is a disposable email they've used.  Currently, you won't be able to trace a suspect for at *least* a year, assuming they've used a mobile phone.  You'll need to go back to a senior officer on multiple occasions (to trace the email, track the IP, and then to obtain further data, etc).  It's likely that by the time you get to the end of your investigation, relevant data will have been deleted.

Under DRIPA, you only need ONE authority for the investigation, and there is no risk of the data being deleted.

Do not assume this legislation is intended entirely for spooks to spy on you.  Bits of it are really important for good old police officers to solve the sudden huge surge in online crime.

The current Labour MP is [Mr Geoffrey Robinson](http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/commons/mr-geoffrey-robinson/307) and has been since the [1976 by-election](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coventry_North_West_by-election,_1976).

There is a lot of speculation at the moment as to whether or not he will be able to complete his whole term of office.

At the General Election Laura Vesty, the [Coventry Green Party](http://coventry.greenparty.org.uk/) candidate received 1961 votes, which is 4.33% of the vote, and an increase of 3.3%. [Source](http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/commons/mr-geoffrey-robinson/307)

The increase is obviously a positive, however there is a chance that we could be hit hard, with High Profile names talked about potentially standing in a Coventry North West By-Election, such as [David Milliband or Ed Balls](http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/coventry-news/could-david-miliband-ed-balls-9232159) and [Nigel Farage](http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/coventry-news/could-nigel-farage-enter-race-9240383)

If there is a Coventry North West by-election, it could certainly be an interesting one to watch.

That is the experience a lot of people have, though. I know at least four people who have gone really quite mad and with a fairly clear link to their weed habit. Meanwhile most of my friends have been taking drugs like MDMA, ketamine and coke, some of them a lot, for a very long time, and while some people have experienced dependency on the drugs, none of them really show any perceptible ill effects and lead perfectly good lives, indistinguishable from anyone else's really.

The smokers on the other hand are barely functional and could quite easily be on the streets now, if not for their families which are fortunately well-off and supportive.

British elections are essentially 650 mini-elections. Losing votes to other similar parties can have a major consequence.

In England I personally think what screwed them was Milibands not being a polished and well spoken guy like Cameron/Blair. The fear of a coalition between Labour and nationalist party also had an impact.

It's just my opinion™. I've expressed the opinion that at 99% anti-equality we would need those laws, and that at the way it is now that i think we need those laws to protect against workplace discrimination, but not customer discrimination. So it's quite clear that there are situations where i would support the law protecting  customers, and situations where i would oppose the law, but now you're asking me at what percentage of public intolerance is where the line is knowing i couldn't possibly give an evidence-based answer and you're calling that a 'cop out'. Behave.

You *could* have acknowledged that i understand the issue to be nuanced and that my opinion on anti-discrimination laws is flexible depending on the situation, and have obviously given careful thought to the question over the years that it has been posed. 

But instead you've decided to consider my lack of an absolute position, or an absolute delineation of percentages at which point my views would change, as if it's a strike against me and my opinion.

Beavers and top level carnivores are ecosystem engineers. They help to generate and maintain healthy ecosystems in which a plethora of other species can thrive. They improve numbers of individuals and species of plants and animals and fungi at every level of the chain. 

We've lost the sense of wonder and wildness of nature. In a lot of ways that means we've forgotten what nature actually is. I think it would be fantastic to be able to travel to wilderness in Britain and see wolves, lynxes, beavers and all sorts of other things. I think it would make us richer, socially and culturally, as well as financially through eco-tourism etc. If we don't think we're ready for predators we should focus on scaling up beaver reintroductions across the whole island - multiple populations in Scotland, Wales and England. 

Beaver wetlands are amazing ecosystems. I had the opportunity to listen to a man heavily involved in beaver reintroduction in the UK and he listed a staggering range of improvements beavers make: they improve water quality, increase the numbers of fish found in the area, increase the numbers of amphibians and birds, help carbon sequestration, and look quite nice too.

You don't deserve this answer given your conduct, but in such an extreme situation where 99% of the population are opposed to equal rights for any particular minority then the issue is clearly making no progress, any ""hearts and minds"" efforts by the 1% isn't working and it would be reasonable to start enforcing equality.

At what percentage of pro-equality population would we need before equality would inevitably be reach without enforced equality? Your guess is as good as mine.

You may recall that a number of years ago a small group of people wanted to withhold the portion of their taxes that were spent on the military.  Although I say withhold, they were willing to pay it, providing it was ring-fenced and therefore **not** spent on the military.  

This went as far as an application to the ECHR *(who refused to hear it)*, with an argument to the effect that the spending of their taxes on the military was a breach of their human rights.  The reason their case failed was essentially that once the government has the cash it just goes into a giant pool.  

There are things I'd be willing to pay a little more for.  Even things like education I don't benefit from directly.  But there's no way I'd give the state any additional income to squander on whatever it feels like.  Public pensions and defence are over 25% of state spending and I'd like to see less of my taxes spent on those, rather than more.

In the US districts can and do raise taxes that are ring-fenced for specific purposes.  So, unlike here they can make a proposal for a tax of *(an additional)* x% which will be spent on something in particular.

Imagine approaching this problem from a real-life practical situation.  If you had a bag of balls in front of you, how would you figure out how many there are?  You could count them - which cannot be done in this question.  You might know the proportion of orange balls and use similar fractions - you can't do that here.  Is it obvious that sampling without replacement could be used?  Maybe - it's kind of like proportion in a way, but the same technique doesn't apply.  Is it obvious that it could result in a quadratic - or even multiple solutions to begin with (granted, one is invalid in this case)?  I doubt it.  It's something you'd only ""get"" once you hit the answer.  I strongly suspect it's the combination of probability and quadratic equations - two very different topics for students of that age - that is the hardest bit to digest and requires the most skill.

I haven't seen previous papers, but when it comes to probability, in this scenario, I think students are only really familiar with scenarios like ""find the number of orange balls"" or ""find the probability of picking an orange ball"".  It requires another thought process to use probability ""backwards"" to find the total number of balls.  After all, with probability, you go from a big number (the total number of balls) to a smaller one (the number of orange balls).

That said, my belief is that students, even at GCSE level, should not struggle with this question.  Students who are too focused on ""rote"" methods of solving equations and exam questions could struggle with questions like these.  To solve this question, you need to think out of the box - you need to apply something closer to critical thinking, in fact.  Maybe that's what's missing - critical thinking - the ability to formulate your own set of facts from smaller pieces of information (i.e. the number of balls doesn't have to be derived by the sum of orange and yellow balls); to read between the lines and try to formulate more facts (i.e. generate a ""squared"" somewhere); and to be able to rearrange the facts to get it to the desired form.

In short - I can see why this is hard, but I think it's a teaching/learning problem if it really is widespread.",null,0,null,1433459546,null,0,false,0,crvv50d,null,t3_38kixu,null,t1_crvv50d,null,t3_38kixu,null,null,null,1436736946,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

This is kind of a misrepresentation, in April 1991, it flatly denied it had a nuclear program, only admitting to it in July 1991. This is only after being caught red-handed and firing shots at weapons inspectors.

Dr. Mahdi Obeidi talks about Rashdiya in his informative book. The building was cleaned initially for inspections, but apparently acting on a source the inspectors came back and took a soil sample from around the facility.

As such as Obeidi describes ""I … ordered the former centrifuge laboratory stripped of its walls and roof, right down to its frame, as well as the excavation of a foot and a half of topsoil from underneath and around the building, extending a hundred feet on the downwind side where traces of uranium might have blown.

 Within a week, I said … “we will fill in the hole with fresh soil and build an exact replica facility out of new materials.

[T]he order seemed impossible. But they quickly realized the only other option would be to take responsibility for breaching the concealment plan. The consequences for our lives and those of our families didn’t bear thinking about.""

In February 1992, Obeidi was given the documentation and prototypes of the centrifuges by Qusay Hussein to hide in his own garden.

Furthermore Iraqi leadership attempted to [bribe](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iraq/1485500/Saddams-2m-offer-to-WMD-inspector.html) inspectors.

No.

And let's be honest. If you have access to a person's digital life, you likely know them more intimately than their spouse. The power and leverage this brings over an individual is total.

They've also embraced self-service checkouts, to enable them to provide even fewer jobs in whichever community they've settled to leech from.

null,false,pcjonathan,smith,Smith,null,"&gt; Most of this is based on the assumption that
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Today is typical, and 
&gt; 
&gt; 2. People won't post more if these changes are made.
&gt; 
&gt; I think its reasonably likely that if big changes are made to this sub, designed to cut off some of the fat and replace it with good stuff, more people will post. At least likely enough to try. I don't know how common this is, but I know that I and some of my friends stopped posting and going on this sub because we were discouraged by the level of crap. It's not far-fetched to think that if you make large changes to the sub, a lot of the people who basically gave up on this place might come back. Again, I'm not certain, but I think its worth experimenting with.
&gt; 
&gt; I also happen to believe in quality &gt; quantity. I would be fine with  fewer posts if the average quality of those posts goes up considerably.

I agree that some of it is at least somewhat assumed. I'm not saying it won't happen. I'm just saying that it doesn't seem like it'll get us anywhere at the present time, so it might not be tested.

But on the first note, while I focused on today, I looked back at the previous month and the average was only around 12 per day. The main purpose of discussion-only is to filter out link posts so that self-posts are more visible, but this has little-to-no effect at that low numbers. Whether just announcing ""Discussion-only"" will subtly persuade people into posting more, as you mention, is another matter entirely and cannot really be firmly predicted.

I totally agree with you that quality is better than quantity, but as it presently stands, it would be removing quantity without getting quality.

&gt;Well you need to use your best judgement and simply withstand the negative feedback. People are going to be upset that their wedding cake post was deleted, I know. But I suspect - based on the response to my post - that the majority in this sub wants less of that shit. Again, I am not certain, but its worth trying out.

This is what we actually do already, albeit to a far more limited extent since *most* of our rules are black and white, but it's not just withstanding the negative feedback because the feedback is feedback. The feedback helps keep us in the know about what people on the subreddit want to see. Again, I'll mention it but this would be a large change in the rules so don't hold your breath.

&gt; Onto the fallacy, its silly to think that because you set up 3 or 4 containment subs, we'll eventually be forced to set up tons. I could easily see there being 4 ""official"" subs: /r/doctorwho, /r/gallifrey, /r/imaginarygallifrey, and some arts-and-crafts specific sub. I think that could work.

I wasn't suggesting we'd have to set up tons, but rather there'd be no point in having /r/DoctorWho. Between /r/Gallifrey covering news/discussion, /r/DoctorWhumour covering memes and other low-effort content and /r/imaginarygallifrey covering 2D art and potentially /r/WhovianCrafts (or similar) covering 3D art and /r/DoctorWhoCosplay for Cosplay, that leaves little-to-nothing left for /r/DoctorWho itself. Personally, I'd much rather attempt to improve it before splitting it off entirely.

&gt; Basically what I'm suggesting is the mods just try some of these things. Do some specialized days, see if that works. Delete more low-quality content, see if that works. Create containment subs, see if that works. Experiment. The only thing we know now is that whatever you guys are currently doing, its not enough.

While I definitely agree, we should experiment more (we've tried floating one or two ideas in the past too), the main issue is that it is an uphill battle. Very few people HERE want to discuss things HERE, mainly because /r/Gallifrey exists.

If so, then that suggests that there may be an over-reliance at GCSE level on using rote methods for solving maths problems and not enough emphasis placed on true understanding. 

For myself, I think this is an excellent question. None of the individual parts is difficult in itself, but it requires the reader to put several things together to reach the solution.

null,false,sharklazers99,null,null,null,"Return to Homs was a disgusting propaganda film. It was filmed by rebels and it's main lead was an incredibly loathsome character. I hate to say this but the day that guy gets killed would be a good day.

It didn't feature the fact that Homsi rebels who came from the poorest section of society started out the revolution by rioting and damaging public property. It said nothing about how they used to kidnap innocent Alawites, pro-government supporters, government workers, invaded the Christian neighbourhoods, evicted the inhabitants and systematically looted it. It showed none of the jihadists who entered from Lebanon.

I also want to clarify one more thing. The FSA doesn't exist. It's a brand name of different groups that had nothing in common. It went from defectors, criminals, smugglers, thugs, jihadists, people who truly believed in the revolution and those fighting because they needed money. ISIS created JaN in 2011 and sent them to Syria. Every single major victory the rebels have achieved was because of JaN and ISIS. Their favourite tactic of sucide bombings is the single most critical weapon system they have. The smart bombs for terrorists. Those who called themselves the ""fsa"" have been working hand in hand with terrorists from the beginning. In fact they have the same opinion on Christians and other non-Sunni Muslims as ISIS. Hell their only complaint about ISIS is the fact that ISIS also beheads them.

The rebels are not good guys. The British government never had any interest in helping Syria. Their primary interest was to have the pro-Iranian government toppled and get a more pro-Western government. That is why they turned a blind eye for two and a half years to jihadis from the UK going to Syria. They not only turned a blind eye as Jordan and Turkey were literally allowing terrorists to enter Syria but gave them international protection. You can't just turn your country into a terrorist safe haven and send them weapons without a reaction. However it's impossible to take these countries up to task because of the US and the UK.

What ISIS did was throw a spanner in the works. While other Jihadi groups are willing to play nice while Assad is still in power. ISIS doesn't give a shit.

Personally for me David Cameron convinced me that the decline in Britains influence is actually. After what he did in Libya and Syria, I don't trust him not to get the UK involved in killing innocent people. I mean at least Tony Blair had no intention of helping people who massacre others routinely.

There's no point in you refusing service to tories because they'd just go somewhere else, and the majority of the population would think you crazy for wanting to ostracise them so badly.

The whole reason that this is an issue is because gay people are a marginalised group, who face discrimination which is both historical and ongoing.

If we allow bakeries to discriminate against gay people then there may be no place they're able to go to get cakes made (at least in some rural areas of Northern Ireland).

Trying to separate gay causes from gay people, and saying ""it's just some words, I shouldn't have to write words I disagree with"" is disingenuous because the bakery is a business.

If I ran a customs greetings card business and rejected your business saying ""I'm not printing a card saying 'Happy Birthday, Rory' - Rory's a fucking stupid name"" then there'd be outrage - I'd be all over social media and getting death threats.

null,false,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,null,"&gt;The state is elected by it's citizens, to represent it's citizens in the running of the state.

Not a necessary feature of a state. You're talking about a democratic state, I can talk more broadly than that and I am.

&gt;Humans, as a collective don't agree on anything, but the vast majority would say that happiness is a positive thing, as such for the government to be representative of it's citizens it's actions should be to maximize for the happiness

Firstly, the ""vast majority"" is not enough if we're talking about forcing people to do things we don't have to force them to do. Secondly, yes of course the vast majority will agree happiness is a positive, *but*, then ask each of those people what happiness is and how it should be brought about and you will receive a new answer for every person you ask, so whose version of happiness do you bring about eh?

What if part of my being happy is becoming happy myself? What if I could never really be satisfied just by being handed on a plate whatever might make me happy?

Once the state starts dictating what happiness is, and that all must be happy, it starts forcing everyone to live a certain way that's been decided by less than everyone, and that forces some people to live in a way they wouldn't want to. Do we want to force people to live in such a way, well of course we don't.

&gt;not in a direct ""you must do this or that"" way, but rather in creating a framework under which humans are happier.

Creating a framework...right, so...taking more of other people's livelihood from them to spend it on things they don't want it spent on? If we have decided that the state is going to administer happiness, or even just as you say a framework for happiness, why should the state not simply take *all* of *everyone's* income and then divide it out in such a way as to maximise happiness?

Also, as an aside, just a little thought experiment, there are a quarter of a million Buddhists in the UK. If it were realised that the other 64.75 million of us would be happier should they be dead, then...in so far as I can see, the state should make the decision to get rid of them. Can you come up with a reasonable explanation for, why, **if** this were the case that the state should not, under your system?

&gt;A semi relevant example to give you an idea of what I mean is citys in the united states, which for the most part are obesogenic, in that the environment that has been created is conducive to an unhealthy life style, where as what I'm saying is that the roll of government is to create a framework which is conducive to happiness.

The issue in the United States is generally one of lack of government interference, which, while having its downsides for those who make poor choices and some unlucky people, has very many upsides for those who make smarter choices. So a classic example related to your obesity thing would be fat-taxes. Fat-taxes benefit the lazy and those lacking self-control to the detriment of the healthy and those with self-control. Now I would argue that those who are fit and healthy and want to eat a cupcake once a month shouldn't pay additional taxation on that cupcake just to stop fat people eating 10 a day, but again under your system of maximising happiness we'd impose the tax and make the blameless shoulder the burden of those who choose to have that burden.",null,0,null,1433462220,null,0,false,0,crvwinz,null,t3_38jv5k,null,t1_crvwinz,null,t1_crvw4js,null,null,null,1436737953,null,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

null,false,for_shaaame,null,null,null,"&gt;Tl;DR: Is it true that the police don't really have a duty to investigate any particular crime? 

I know of no written rule that says the police as an organisation must investigate every report of crime it receives; only that the police must record every report.  However, as a police officer myself, I can tell you that my organisation requires me to investigate every report I receive - I believe this is our policy rather than a national directive.

&gt;Is it true that the human rights act can be used to compell them to take a case more seriously? 

I don't see how it could be.  We already take every report seriously, but we have a duty as a public organisation to use our limited resources in an effective way.  This means tailoring our response to the offence and keeping our response proportionate.  For example, while it might be proportionate in a murder investigation to interview a hundred people and watch a thousand hours of CCTV footage, that would obviously not be proportionate in an investigation into someone breaking into a car - even though it might well yield a suspect at the end.  The Human Rights Act is not going to change what is proportionate to an investigation.

&gt;Is this the EU Human Rights Act or a different one?

null,false,KaiserMacCleg,,,null,"&gt; Was Welsh home rule something legitimately being discussed back in 1926?

Well, Lloyd George was a well known advocate of home rule for Wales as well as for Ireland. Some time earlier, before the turn of the twentieth century, he was a prominent member of [Cymru Fydd](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cymru_Fydd), an organisation with the express intent of securing Welsh home rule.

That ambition seems to have been lost later in his political life, particularly during his tenure as Prime Minister (understandably, given the considerable pressures of the day).

Cymru Fydd had died back by the twenties. Labour and the Liberals accomodated calls for Welsh home rule to a degree, though as far as I'm aware they never explicitely supported the position as parties. 1925 saw the founding of Plaid Cymru, who would gradually gain traction over the following decades.

It isn't just a decision taken lightly, if the government brought in at £45Billion and will sell at £30Billion.  The shares haven't really moved  in any direction that makes sense holding onto them.  If you can use the 30Bill elsewhere now for good why not? 

Point is, it might take another 5 years before RBS shares break even, but in those 5 years, inflation has taken place, and while the £ amount is the same as when the government purchased them, the real monetary value has decreased by 3 to 4 Billion in the 5 years more that we had to hold onto them.


So there are a few things to factor in. 
 
* While the shares increase in pounds, those pounds buy less in the market.  

* There is no guarantee the shares will ever reach the price to break even in £ amount.

* Investors are always wary of a business part owned by a government, especially one such as a bank where sometimes politicians pressure/force policy through that isn't in the best interest of investors.

* The £30 Billion we get now can be used for actual things such as schools, healthcare, infrastructure, actually giving people jobs and investing in physical things for the UK's future, rather than sitting in a bank doing nothing (but hopefully accumulating value).

The one which is backed with evidence, lots of people have opinions not everyone is correct, science is our most powerful tool for determining facts, we should use it more often.

&gt;Creating a framework...right, so...taking more of other people's livelihood from them to spend it on things they don't want it spent on? If we have decided that the state is going to administer happiness, or even just as you say a framework for happiness, why should the state not simply take all of everyone's income and then divide it out in such a way as to maximise happiness?

This is a sliding scale, we already have a non libertarian society but rather a socialist leaning capitalist government here in europe. which already does many of the things which you are saying are authoritarian.

&gt;Also, as an aside, just a little thought experiment, there are a quarter of a million Buddhists in the UK. If it were realised that the other 64.75 million of us would be happier should they be dead, then...in so far as I can see, the state should make the decision to get rid of them. Can you come up with a reasonable explanation for, why, if this were the case that the state should not, under your system?

If such a scenario was to arise there would be more options than just getting rid of them, to say otherwise would be to engage in the black and white fallacy, lets not be extreme here, the idea that the actions of the state should be for the maximization of happiness, it's self would have to operate within democratically defined limits, peoples morals don't always align with what would be better for them personally but rather what they believe to be just.

&gt;The issue in the United States is generally one of lack of government interference, which, while having its downsides for those who make poor choices and some unlucky people, has very many upsides for those who make smarter choices. So a classic example related to your obesity thing would be fat-taxes. Fat-taxes benefit the lazy and those lacking self-control to the detriment of the healthy and those with self-control. Now I would argue that those who are fit and healthy and want to eat a cupcake once a month shouldn't pay additional taxation on that cupcake just to stop fat people eating 10 a day, but again under your system of maximizing happiness we'd impose the tax and make the blameless shoulder the burden of those who choose to have that burden.

As with everything it's about balance, you would need to create a framework that fairly determines how we should operate with precedent given to negative effects of legislation, IE someone gaining £1 is not as good as some one losing £1 is bad but rather the loss is worse, as this is how losses are perceived by humans emotionally,  and thus how it would effect happiness as a whole the, discrepancy would have to be investigated in order to determine how we should operate.",null,0,null,1433465714,null,0,false,0,crvyafg,null,t3_38jv5k,null,t1_crvyafg,null,t1_crvwinz,null,null,null,1436739191,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Blatant fear-mongering and completely ignoring the global recession that Labour had to originally tackle.

The Tories have had the benefit of overseeing the country pulling itself back onto its knees. It all comes down to fortuitous timing from how I see it.

Propaganda isn't everything though, of course. 

Labour campaigned fucking terribly, to the point where I ended up spoiling my ballot after being pretty sure I was going to vote for them. They ran a mushy ""yeah, austerity is pretty poop"" line but didn't actually come out with any hard policies, like the SNP did. What was the thrust of the Labour campaign this time? It had no momentum, and wasn't helped by Miliband being a bit of a funny looking bloke (which the newspapers caught and ran with).

Lastly, I've no evidence for this, but I also imagine a lot of UKIP's support is ex labour (working class, immigrants are taking our jerbs), meaning Labour was spoilt by all 4 of the other major parties (SNP, UKIP, Greens and LD's) whilst the Tories only had to worry about some moving over to UKIP.

It was a perfect storm of an election.

I'll read the article now.

My first car was a 15 year old £500 ford fiesta and lasted 3 years with about £200-£300 annual repairs including MOT. My second car was an 8 year old fiat punto cost £1700 and lasted 6 years with minimal repairs until the last two years, when I was basically waiting for it to die. 

I've just replaced it for another fiat punto 12 years old, 50 000 mileage, only had 2 owners and it cost £800, then I put it in the garage and spent £500 getting absolutely everything on it fixed. 

£250 to insure, tax is £140 a year, it gets 50 mpg around town and parts are easy to get hold of and cheap. I spend maybe £15 a month on petrol, unless I'm doing a big trip to my parents 300 miles away.

It took about 6 weeks for me to find the last car. Second hand garages were selling similar cars with much higher mileage at £1400, and cars that were newer were out of my price range but still came with 80000 miles. 

Look around, don't be in a rush. Do more than one viewing of a car and if you don't know anything about cars then get it checked at a local garage, most of them will do it for £20.

Cars will always cost you money, getting a newer car with maybe the exception of if you're buying a 2/3 year old one is no guarantee you won't be stuck with a big repair bill.

Edit: my insurance figure is provably a bit off that's how much it costs for me and my partner with 7 years no claims. When I got my first punto it was £800 a year to insure I'd been driving 2 years at that point I think.

The signings I think we will have are Benteke, Ings, Milner, a new goalie and a new left back. I couldn't think of a backup RCB behind Skrtel until I clicked off it and remembered Toure... Same with Manquillo at RB. I think we'll keep Sterling too.

The foundation of the formation is a modified 4-3-3. Coutinho is far more central instead of wide allowing him to support and supply our forward. Milner being a good wide option will drift out that side to add the width when Coutinho runs centrally. Milner and Moreno add the left hand width with Milner covering for Moreno if Moreno advances forward. 

Sterling will be wide with the capability of cutting inside. He will supply crosses and cutbacks etc. But he will be allowed to have a roam centrally if he feels like it. 

Henderson will be box-to-box both going forward and tracking back. Allow Hendo to be Hendo basically. 

Lucas will be Lucas and protect the back four and get support from the 2 engines of Henderson and Milner. I'm really hoping we do keep Lucas and hopefully even get backup to him or at least for Can to step up in the holding role. 

Clyne and Moreno to roam forward when applicable. 

[This is my lineup for with Sturridge](http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=7sx58). I got a little excited and clicked off of Benteke and Sturridge, but their backups would be Ings, Origi and Sterling. 

This formation is a modified Diamond/ Christmas tree formation. Sturridge would be a bit deeper than Benteke and would feed off his knockdowns and run from deeper at the opposition. His creativity would also come in handy for him dropping out wide if needed. Benteke would stay more central, making sure to bully the central defense, and keep them pushed back and off of our creators.

Coutinho would have a similar role to the prior formation, much more license to stay centrally and play in the other forwards/ make the team tick over in the final third. Milner would wonder to the wider left and provide the width, or Moreno overlaps and Milner stays back and covers centrally. 

Clyne would overlap with Hendo covering and making himself available as an option out. 

Lucas and the rest of the defense have near enough the same task.",null,0,null,1433467162,null,0,false,0,crvz17d,null,t3_38lh3j,null,t1_crvz17d,null,t3_38lh3j,null,null,null,1436739741,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

Giffgaff use o2. Virgin use EE (without 4G).

o2 and Vodafone now share their masts. If you check their 4G maps you'll find them identical. 

EE was formed by the T-Mobile / Orange merge. Since then, the Orange masts are being brought into the T-mobile network to create EE.

3 and T-mobile shared 3G. So 3 has around 90% of the 3G that EE does, which will rise as the last few old Orange masts are brought into the T-mobile based EE network. They do not share 4G and 3 no longer have any access to 2G except in very rare cases.

EE have by far the most 4G in Wales, including silly places like the top of Snowdon. I'd suggest that there is already much more EE 4G in Wales than o2/Voda 3G.

Voda / o2 might have the best 2G but their 3G is miles behind EE / 3. Check the coverage map for any 3G away from the bigger towns, even places like Caernarfon are still 2G only. EE have 3G on pretty much every single mast.

If I had to recommend one, I'd say 'BT Mobile' as you get access to EE 4G coverage without paying their rediculous prices. All they offer though is 12 month sim only contracts so might not be suitable.

&gt; - Huge imposing force (something we sorely lack in the final third. ) We have no players that really challenge defenders, and Benteke would really give teams who sit back issues, something we haven't been able to counter well under Rodgers)

&gt; - He's quick. Not insanely quick, but he can burn past defenders easily enough, and coupled with his strength it makes him stupidly difficult to defend against. 

&gt; - He can finish very well, with both feet and his head. We all know how much we've missed someone that can do this, this season. 

&gt; - He presses well and makes very intelligent runs. He has the instincts of a killer forward. He will find that gap in the defense to run into. He will drop into some space to pick up the ball for a shot, he will pop at the back post when that cross is whipped in. 

I think we have the players that could truly make him flourish, and his presence keeping defenders occupied would allow our more creative players to flourish too. 

It's formations like [this](http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=7sx58) and [this](http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=7sx56)(this one is for if and when Sturridge is out), in which I think we could truly do damage to other teams.

I think it currently is quite unrepresentative of the fanbase for the show that is here and personally I don't think it's an attractive subreddit to any new fans searching out a community based on the show. 

You're completely right on the /r/Gallifrey front. It has pretty firmly established itself as the home of in depth discussion, as such the fans who are looking for this type of content seem to not even approach this subreddit anymore, so when an attempt to birth discussion is made here it rarely makes any noticeable impact. If this is to be changed, and I feel it should, discussion is what keeps a community alive (far more than 6 consecutive pictures of Karen Gillan from the same fan photo op), then it needs to be nurtured and I firmly believe a schedule of stickied 'event' posts is the solution to this. I think imposing themed days would be a step too far at this point, though it may be something to consider on odd days if things were positively received. 

I know a lot of people are saying that we're in the 'off season' currently and blaming that for the lack of discussion, but with Doctor Who there really is no off season. There's so much material being released constantly, not to mention 80% of the main show that most of the fanbase here won't have encountered. I'm not saying these topics are going to be for everyone, but there's certainly enough interested for them to be worthwhile, proven by the discussion whenever a post like this one is made. Plus the strongest subreddit would be one which unites the different types of fans. A schedule along these lines is what I would pitch:

**Two monthly summary and discussion threads for audio releases and comic/novel releases respectively staggered fortnightly.** We are at an unprecedented high as far as the sheer amount of original Doctor Who being released currently. Big Finish are giving us 4 or 5 releases a month and Titan have 3 ongoing comic series as well as special runs. Whilst dedicated threads for each release should be left to /r/Gallifrey there is without doubt the material to justify combined threads existing here too. A general help feature could be incorporated into these topics too for anyone seeking advice on where to start in these mediums. Have each stickied Monday to Friday of their respective week, with a week gap between and given a very clear premise.

**A weekly news summary and discussion thread.** A very straight to the point summary of the biggest news stories offering open discussion. A few people below are complaining about news getting buried, for example a BBC announcement about directors, but this is somewhat understandable, whilst being important and interesting it isn't exactly attention grabbing news and can easily get lost in the shuffle. Consolidating these posts into one event would present them in an easily digestible bulletin and ensure all news was in a simple to locate place. I would not include spoilers and filming reports in here, only extend news of episodes themselves to what is announced officially by the BBC, though the idea of a 'spoilers' thread could be explored. Have this scheduled for every Sunday. 

**A weekly 'Classic Who' thread during the 'off season'.** There's a lot of posts from fans curious about the classic series that get buried or unanswered here. The classic Doctors are just as prominent in the header so it seems quite right that they should get the spotlight sometimes. Now I don't think specific episode watches and discussion would be the right approach to take here, that should probably stay within the remit of /r/Gallifrey again, though it could perhaps occur as a monthly event within the format of these threads. This could just be a general space for questions about the classic era to be asked, small discussion on character/eras/stories to be started and interesting material related to the era to be shared. As it's TV Doctor Who give it the natural spot of Saturdays.

This is jut a very basic layout of threads covering what I feel are the biggest areas of discussion, I wouldn't want to over-saturate it. There's of course still a lot of room to add anything further. This could also include weekly/monthly showcases of art/crafts/convention photos and all the other content currently taking the spotlight. 

An overhaul of this scale would of course require a lot of effort to orchestrate and would require planning and dedication by the team responsible, perhaps requiring new blood who actively follow the described fields being brought in, I'll admit I know nothing of the current mod team or their duties. However executed correctly I think it could encourage a very positive rebirth for this sub and somewhat bring back together the ever fracturing community.",null,0,null,1433471756,null,0,1433471951,0,crw1hzx,null,t3_38jrbn,null,t1_crw1hzx,null,t1_crvnt6o,null,null,null,1436741166,null,10,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,10,null

Some of it isn't necessarily for public access, but generally if the government can see a particular piece of data, assume that a) at least one corporation, b) at least one foreign government (and not necessarily ""friendly"" governments like America, but also Russia and China for whom no amount of treaties will stop this), and c) at least one major online crime organisation have seen this.  That doesn't necessarily give our government the right to snoop and pry in these details, but it does make this very different from simply being able to see inside your house.

Secondly, there is a stupendous amount of information.  The only thing working through most of this data is a computer.  Sure, that computer will eventually feed all the connections to a person, and that person may specifically be looking at an individual's accounts, but again, that's so incredibly different from your examples as to make them worthless.  Nobody cares about your emails, and nobody's going to read them.  There is too much data for anyone to see the things you are doing.

There are some very important things that we do need to care about.  Firstly, encryption is absolutely important.  Not as a tool to fight the government, because the government is generally the least of our worries.  No, you need encryption because otherwise you'll end up on an unsecure network trying to log into your bank account, and the next thing you know you've got no money any more.  We should fight to keep encryption.

Secondly, the less data is stored the better.  If one person has data (and *especially* if the person who has that data isn't the government, as would be the case if ISPs needed to collate data), then there is *always* the chance that someone else can get the data.  That should just be a default assumption we make when storing digital data, particularly digital data that comes from a distributed system.  Someone might do something stupid, and *bang*, all that information is spread across the web, and now in the hands of people who should definitely not have it.  So I would argue that the government should not ask for more data to be stored than would otherwise be stored, perhaps even going so far as to put limits on what data can be stored.  Not for 'freedom' reasons, but for damn simple security reasons.  I don't trust most companies to think of these things themselves.

Thirdly, and this is for me the most important, and the one I'm most scared about losing, all data accesses must be dealt with formally.  That is, if you want access to my computer, you need a warrant, and you're going to need a pretty good reason to see it.  Not just ""oh, I'm interested in this"", but ""we have significant reason to believe this person has committed a crime, and this will almost certainly provide evidence to lock them up and find out who helped"".  You know, the basic stuff that we have now.  If the police genuinely believe that I have information, then they should be able to obtain it lawfully in a correct, judicial manner.  If we don't allow that then we end up with a completely toothless justice system, and on balance I care less about my own 'freedom', and more about the personal safety of others.  Warrantless tapping is bad.  Warranted tapping is, if not good, then at least somewhat necessary.  We should fight to make sure that these accesses of data are ultimately done out in the open so that we're all aware of what information the police are asking for, and so that we can start screaming when they begin overstepping their bounds.",null,0,null,1433472684,null,0,false,0,crw1zoy,null,t3_38i6ki,null,t1_crw1zoy,null,t1_crv9nie,null,null,null,1436741342,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

Well clearly you're just here to bitch about people making a post you could have ignored, so this is getting nowhere. 

First you say that it's because this stuff never gets posted (oh, but of course, only the people who agree with the opinion that seeing more of it wouldn't be bad should post stuff like that, rather than question why it doesn't get to the top, or posted at all--since, you know, people may not have noticed it before, but now may make actual effort to do so.), but now it's because people don't like it? 

People calmly trying to explain to you that this post is honestly pointing out something that could help improve post quality, and you're here getting all pissy because they have an opinion that isn't yours. It's almost like you have a hatred against posts that aren't the crafty circlejerk this sub can be. You constantly ignore points that respond to shit you've asked and ask it again. We've already discussed that these things aren't seen because the community would rather upvote the same thing over and over again, which honestly, does get a bit tiring. I unsubscribed for a while because of it. There's not a lot of discussion around here anymore, and it could maybe pick up, if the posts got a chance to flourish. But while they have to compete with the regular subreddit meta, it's not gonna happen. Posting more of it will hardly help, because it'll get just as little attention. HOWEVER, making mention that these kinds of post could USE more attention, as this post is trying to do, COULD help. 

(also, commenting on two different posts that you made in the same thread of comments, addressing them in context rather than completely on another isn't ""following you around"". You could have chosen to not reply to both of them, or either of them, for all I care. So, I'll address the lurker comment I mentioned before, here. That way I'm not being creepy by saying two different things on the internet.) Lurkers, meaning people who don't post, can see what's happening on reddit just as much as those who do. Making a post pointing out the state of things is fair game for everyone. One person (OP) isn't going to make the difference by posting a couple things here and there if they're going to be drowned out by the rest of it. But mentioning it with a post like this helps others to make an effort to make the posts as well, so that they can compete.  So no, it's not entitled to mention the stuff doesn't get posted, because that's not the POINT. And WAIT WHOA, WE'RE BACK TO MY ORIGINAL REPLY.

I think even that is pushing it, because it implies that people are listening to the debate itself.

I suspect that Tony Blair enjoyed so much electoral success partly for this reason (not that I'm a fan of Blair).

&gt; In comparison Ed Miliband might have said some interesting things, but they weren't conveyed in a way that made people take it very seriously. 

Totally agree with everything you say here and I don't think you should feel bad for pointing it out. It's one thing to discuss it and another to approve of this kind of ""personality based politics"" :)

A whole bunch of aspects about the way he talks and presents himself combined to give the impression of him as a nerd. I'd add to what you said here that his personal appearance also worked against him. While watching the TV debates I found myself thinking that I wish he'd spent some time at the gym to build himself up.

Things like these shouldn't matter, but the sad thing is that they do.

Arguably, our Self-Post Sundays is what has kept the perceived quality of our subreddit afloat, and as such we've achieved a very healthy balance of discussion and content. I mean sure, there are shitposters rampant - but it can be argued that there is low-effort content posted on many subs over the 100k subsciber mark. It's the job of the moderator to not only quell these, but encourage the community they moderate to have the mentality to shift their attention away from such posts.

What I've noticed here, is rather the opposite. It's not actively done per say, rather the lack of moderator activity here seems to have put this subreddit on a massive downward spiral into the concerns that OP has raised. 

As such, there are absolutely minimal threads posted by moderators here that encourage discussion and encourage discourse surrounding certain species, series, doctors, themes, story arcs or even the state of the subreddit itself. Alongside this, there are *no* events, *no* thumbnails and *no* flairs for content.

Needless to say - in the time I've spent here (and I've been subbed for a very long time), I've never felt the need to post anything. I've never felt the need to participate in any discussion. I've never wanted to. Why? Because this subreddit does not encourage it, and does not make me feel welcome. It doesn't feel like a niche corner of the internet where fans can hang out and discuss, like the majority of show-related subreddits. It feels rather like a repository, the arse-end of the internet for Who-related content. 

If you want to see change, there's no use throwing up your hands and saying there is nothing you can do about it. The reason the subreddit is in the condition it is in, is because of the lack of moderator participation.

null,false,Putinfanboy1000,null,null,null,"Most of the welfare budget is spent on pensioners. About £100 billion per year.  I've seen figures showing it rising to £225 billion per year for state pensions by about 2030.
The NHS cost is roughly similar about £113 billion per year and rising every year. Something like 75% of the NHS budget is spent on pensioners too. 

The problem with the welfare state is that we have a humongous bottleneck of pensioners that are all retiring now, paying less tax and not enough tax payers to support this demographic bulge of people.

Probably the greatest challenge that the UK faces really, but the newspapwes are all focused on working age benefit fraud, which accounts for 0.7% of the welfare bill. 

Edit* there are other problems related to the pensioner crisis too.
Housing market. Pensioners account for the majority of the housing ""wealth"" in this country valued in the trillions, they only get to realise those trillions if the young pay for it.its worth noting the pensioners had cheap housing relative to wages for decades, paying between 2.5 -3 times their national average wage for an average home. 

Job security was also fantastic, along with wage inflation. So the the expectation that younger generations *must* pay up to 10 times national average wage for a house that if new build is smaller In square footage than the comparable starter homes when pensioners were young, is a bit greedy.

In a world of globalisation and deflation, asking the next gen to pay trillions for your bungalows is going to have a negative effect on things like consumer spending or having children (future workers and taxpayers) to keep the system going which leads into my next point.

Pensioners actually haven't paid enough into the welfare state to cover their welfare bill.  What is paid in taxes today goes on current spending today. The taxes the pensioners paid through their lives was enough to pay for the smaller and less long lived pensioners of *their* era. 
So when they say they've paid in all their lives, well yes but they haven't paid enough for their *own* lives.  That obligation is handed down to the smaller generations that come after the boomers and pre boomers.

Boomers and pensioners if today will die having taken out £250,000 more than they have paid in taxes out of the state.
The average younger UK citizen will die having paid in £150,000 more than they use to cover it. 
That they must do so whilst struggling with a vastly more competitive global work market,  far higher and unjustifiable house prices (cost of living) falling wages and the dismantling of public services and public spending for their own working age population is one of the biggest injustices in UK life.

&gt; If you don’t apply or you’re unsuccessful in your application, you’ll still have a job until your employer makes you redundant.

By asking you to resign they want to avoid marking you officially redundant, which depending on how long you've worked at the company may entitle you to a redundancy payment.

Just because I'm the son of a tradesman, doesn't mean I'm automatically qualified to build loft conversations.

I understand that in reality the monarch does not use their political power, but the fact is there is room to. Even so, now we are seeing the spider memos, where Charles has attempted to influence government policy.

What bothers me the most is the blatant nepotism that is rampant. Just the other day I saw Prince William in an elevated position in the FA. And this isn't the only time, there are many examples of this. Although, fair play to Harry for doing a tour in Afghanistan, both Princes were given helicopter pilot training, which I find hard to believe both achieved on their own merit; but of course, for the most part this is just speculation. It's the 'freebies' that even less important family members get. Just the other week I saw it reported that both Princess Beatrix and the other one (whose name alludes me) had been taking very expensive holidays off the backs of tax payers money.

The inequality in this country is only increasing and there's something not right when those on benefits are being scapegoated, while the royal family receive inordinate amounts of money from the government, for doing a 'job' that quite frankly any ordinary British family could do. There's little evidence to suggest that the family are profitable, which leaves room to suggest that they are a burden on the tax payer. I apologise for the lack of citations, but I'm on my phone, rushing this response before I head of to my last uni exam.

But I hope you can see my point of view. Even so, if they were profitable, the whole system of nepotism is undemocratic, unmeritocratic and down right unjustified. The queen derives her right to rule from God, which brings up entirely different arguments. But I fear I've gone into a little unconstructed rant.

Like I said, I apologise for the lack of citations. But I'd be interested to know why you presumably support them. I don't know many monarchists, so it'd be interesting to see your side of the argument. :)

Edit: I will agree that for the most part, the Queen has been a good Head of State. But it still leaves the argument, why can't the public elect others that have the potential to do better.

We would immeasurably poorer as a culture if our united kingdom ever broke up.

Royal Mail sometimes makes money and sometimes it doesn't. When people say ""Royal Mail is profitable"" they are pointing to certain years only because since about 2002 it's had like 7 years profitable and 6 years of losses. And they're spread out so it's not like there were 6 poor years then 7 golden years. Losses sit in between profits.

With that in mind, the last government decided to look to privatise the firm because, they claimed, that would help RM keep pace with its competitors.

What's the issue with competitors? Someon can set up a mail delivery firm and only deliver to London, or Birmingham. Places that are densely packed. Meanwhile, RM still had deliver to isolated farmhouses on the Shetland Islands. Legally, the have to. Other firms don't. That means that remote places essentially rely on RM to receive their mail. 

What is concerning those who live rurally is that with privatisation, RM shareholders will look at the balance sheet and see that they have to charge higher prices across the board to make up for the extra cost of delivery to rural areas - in effect, London etc are subsidising mail to remote communities. They'll see that, and suggest a saving on this front. Or at least that is what is feared.

People have also said that the Universal Service Obligation (that the RM must deliver to everyone) is at risk. The government and coalition from last term will argue that the Postal Services Act, which contains within it a provision to make Ofcom the 'legal guardian' of the RM, will ensure that the USO is protected because it's the law. This was a new change (and really one that should have been there from the start!). However, others will point to comments from Moya Greene, RM CEO, who said that the USO is ""at risk"" and people are generally sceptical of what governments and politicians say anyway.

A further issue to tangle this web is the Post Office. Remember that the PO and RM are two separate entities, though entwined. From a rural perspective, Post Offices are vital to keep remote communities together. They are an essential glue for some small communities. If the Royal Mail changes its USO and suddenly it's not delivering to everywhere and people are using it less, the Post Office branches can suffer and potentially close.",null,0,null,1433488146,null,0,false,0,crw8ij1,null,t3_38icbt,null,t1_crw8ij1,null,t1_crvj5cm,null,null,null,1436745693,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

I think **Coates** will probably move on, I believe Sunderland are interested in a permanent move. But also that Sampdoria who had an eye on him last summer are looking for another centre back at the moment. Saying all that, I would've let Kolo move on and worked Coates back into the squad.

I think **Wisdom** will probably stick around this year, he's had loan spells in the Championship and the PL now and seems pretty established. He's young-ish, English and in his first season here Rodgers was shown to like him. Keeping him as a 5th CB/3rd RB will still see him make appearances due to to EL and the League Cup which I suspect will be on the back burner until the later rounds. Also, he seems perfectly built for the RCB role if we go back to the 3-4-3 at any points next season.

I like Tiago **Ilori** and I'm exited for his future, he's maybe a little injury prone but he's performed at decent levels for Sporting, Granada and Bordeaux now. I'd still like to see him play some PL football though, having only managed about 40 first team appearances. Hopefully we can loan him out to Palace/Villa and see him toughen and bulk up as looking at his frame he seems a little lightweight.

All in all I think it's promising that we currently have plenty of CB's at the club, especially as only two of have even hit their 30's.

null,false,studavis,null,null,null,"Well I could write an essay on this but I'll keep it brief. The West Midlands metropolitan county broadly consists of three areas. Birmingham, The Black Country (a collective area of Walsall, Wolverhampton and Dudley &amp; surrounding areas - not an 'official' area in any government sense) and Coventry.

People seem to think the West Midlands = Birmingham but it's much more complex than that.

The big battle exists between the Black Country and Birmingham. The Black Country, despite bringing so much to the West Midlands, normally gets drawn the short straw against it's bigger more powerful neighbour of Birmingham. The collective councils which do nothing to help this within the BC are partly to blame, but whilst many small towns rot in the BC Birmingham seemingly gets endless funding for regeneration.

That said, it's not all sweetness and light in Brum. Despite having lots going for it, there are areas of really desperate heavy depravation in Brum, and whilst it is normally lauded for its multi-culturalism it does bring its challenges to areas very close to the City Centre.

Black Country folk are very down to earth people who like a laugh. Brummies can be a bit snobbish towards them which probably causes more tension for teh Brummies than for the BC folk, who laugh it off.

Both Brummies and the Black Country get a raw deal in the rest of the country. The accent isn't great but it's no worse than a lot of other British ones, and people south of the Midlands consider us to be a bit thick and simple. Their opinion tends to change if they actually visit, where they find a lot of friendship and humour.

Whilst traditionally industrial, it's now like most post-industrial areas where there isn't much going on (still fairly healthy though, especially in the Black Country). Don't ever forget that the Midlands (Warwickshire &amp; Worcester as it was then) started and drove the great industrial revolution, which within 30 years essentially created and laid the bedrock for modern worldwide manufacturing as we know it. That's something to be proud of.

Oh, and Coventry - they were sort of placed in the West Midlands by default back in 1974. I've been to Coventry many times and it's not much like Birmingham / The BC - it's very much it's own City. A fairly strange place with a crazy number of gangland type murders.

The big debate going on now is whether The BC and Cov merge with Birmingham to become 'Greater Birmingham' and get the perceived benefits that come from it. The BC folk are fiercely loyal to being called the BC and don't want it - the BC councils do, to get themeselves out of the mess they've got themselves in. I suspect the reality will be that business as usual if it does happens, with inner Birmingham (Birmingham as we know it) being proportionally over funded to outer Birmingham (Cov &amp; The BC) anyway. I think Coventry will be happy to go along with whatever.

null,false,darksurfer,null,null,null,"&gt;Is the state really that wasteful though?

yes. in my experience the larger an organisation is, the more wasteful it is. waste is an inherent cost of being ""big"". this is especially so in public sector organisations arguably because there is no ""profit motive"" to drive down costs.

this means there are potentially huge savings to be made in any large organisation by being more efficient. the trouble is, identifying and realising those savings at large scale is difficult and costly in itself. very easy to spend millions attempting to make something more efficient only to end up with something which is *less* efficient but  that managers have to spin to make it look a roaring success.

it doesn't help *at all* that a great many people are motivated (quite rationally) to act in their own personal interests rather than that of their organisation. No-one is going to stick their hand up and make themselves redundant. On the contrary, a great many people are focussed on empire building, getting promotions and protecting their jobs - saving money for their organisation is the last thing on their mind - and even if it was, organisational politics would make that all but impossible anyway.

budget cutting is a very crude tool that governments can use to force organisations to ""trim the fat"" from their operation but it's hardly an optimal approach not least because of the aforementioned empire building and ""careerism"".

tl;dr in *theory* there will be vast potential efficiency savings in the NHS that *could* cut the total budget significantly (say 25%) whilst even *improving* services. in practice that would be very difficult to achieve. the kinds of people who are genuinely able to create such efficiency savings are in very short supply and there are *plenty* of people who will claim they can make such savings in order to feather their own nest.

As top post said dont cover the front brake while riding, or clutch. The rear brake is more than sufficient for speed control at low speed

When you're at the lights in town with the red 3 way sign you're again hovering the brake and trying to find your throttle point. When stopped you should be left leg down, with right foot still on the brake if you're in gear, for a long wait by all means put both feet down. 

Throttle control needs work, a full hand on it will help.

Brakes should be all fingers. The act of doing this will automatically roll off the throttle as you reach for them

You seem front brake happy. Don't be, especially in corners, that's how you loose it.

Your riding distances seem a bit close, especially for new rider. This is highlighted by how close you got to the white van near the end.

Look up more, it feels like you're reading the road from 3feet in front of the the wheel. This will help with reading other vehicles. The way you had to brake hard at the 3way lights suggests the same to me.

And finally observations - I slipped around and watched a bit more while writing this. Didn't see anymore life savers, saw little helmet movement either for mirrors. I can't stress enough how important observation is. Every time you turn a corner (junction) you should life saver, especially when turning across traffic. Every junction at a round about. Don't be silly with it, but I know you would have been taken through this in detail. There are a myriad of videos by far more experienced than me, google it.

I am wondering if we're going to have to switch more and more to transaction and consumption taxes: corporation taxes (on profits), just like wealth taxes and just like window taxes before them, don't work: they're taxed on something far too flexible. All of a sudden I don't have any windows. 

(Maybe a land value tax and taxes on other productive assets are an outlier to my theory here).

Generally speaking, a corporation's profits can disappear with some relatively simple accounting, and so does the corporation tax.

Taxing on transactions is much harder to avoid; whether that is income (PAYE), money transfers, asset purchases (stamp duty), VAT, capital gains taxes, dividends taxes. There isn't anywhere near as much incentive for one of the transacting parties to artificially decrease the value of what is being transacted to reduce the tax bill... or even change their behaviour at all (unlike a wealth or corporation tax), where the incentive is unilateral as opposed to transaction taxes, where the incentive needs to shared by both parties.

My current layman interpretation of tax and behavioural economics has me wondering if we should just do away with corporation tax rates, and tax transactions more (individual incomes, dividend taxes, get rid of tax write-offs for debt interest, increase benefit-in-kind measures, inheritance tax). A corporation is a virtual entity; it is flexible, international and the rules of the game change every 500 miles on land. I think a worldwide corporation tax system would not only be a bad idea (anti-competitive, will driven down tax and governance innovation) but essentially impossible.

You need to do lifesavers before moving position majorly in your lane [like passing parked cars]. It's something an examiner will be looking for, and you can easily fail on if you forget.

Are you a driver?  
I ask because your lane position seems to be over to the right hand side, where you'd be if you were sitting in a car.   
On a clear road, you want to be in the centre of the lane - also known as the 'dominant position'. As you improve, this position will adjust to situations, but for now it works to ""own"" the lane and discourage undertaking by bell-ends. Because it does happen [and has happened to me, even when dominant]

The weird angle of your mirrors confuses my brain; but if it gives you a good view behind you, keep it. (:

In addition to the lever, with your right hand - you look like you got [not sure how to describe this] it dropped way too much. When you've hit the speed you want to be at, your wrist should be in a relaxed position so there is less strain on it. It's quite possible to shift the position of your grip after you're at the speed you want. It also helps in making the rolling off of the throttle a very conscious move.  
As an aside to that, no idea if you have or not, but make sure that your grip on the bars is loose. You should be able to open your hands, with the bars resting in the crook of your thumb and forefinger, and have no loss of control.  
You'll know you're not doing that if your hands, arms and/or shoulders feel tense after a ride.

Both hands on the bars as much as possible for now. [Spotted it around the 21 min mark] :p  
We all do it, especially in 'safe' traffic, but it's a bad habit to get into so early

It really does look like the handlebars are squint, but that could be camera angle

Finally, at about 26:40 you take a left hand, and it looks like you may have got a bit of target fixation on the car on the other side of the road [where you almost go over the line].  
Basically, you came in a bit fast and went ""oh, shi.. I might hit that car!"" and almost did because you thought about the car.  
In those situations, focus on where you want to be, not where you don't. That alone will get you out of a *lot* of issues.",null,0,null,1433493288,null,0,false,0,crw9rmn,null,t3_38mzg9,null,t1_crw9rmn,null,t3_38mzg9,null,null,null,1436746612,null,4,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,4,null

Quick wiki search - richest British person is Gerald Grosvenor, 6th Duke of Westminster with a net worth of roughtly £9billion.

&gt;Grosvenor’s history began with the marriage of Mary Davies and Sir Thomas Grosvenor in 1677. Mary had inherited the manor of Ebury, 500 acres of land north of the Thames to the west of the City of London, which remained largely untouched by the Grosvenors until the 1720s, when they developed the northern part - now known as Mayfair – around Grosvenor Square. A few generations later, in the 1820s, their focus moved south - to what is now Belgravia - developing Eaton Square, Chester Square and other famous addresses. Later in the 19th century, the area of Pimlico was developed; this was sold in 1953.

Originally the report was more damning but with international pressure Iraq was changing their direction and Blix later on said

&gt; It is obvious that, while the numerous initiatives, which are now taken by the Iraqi side with a view to resolving some long-standing open disarmament issues, can be seen as “active”, or even “proactive”, these initiatives 3–4 months into the new resolution cannot be said to constitute “immediate” cooperation. Nor do they necessarily cover all areas of relevance. They are nevertheless welcome and UNMOVIC is responding to them in the hope of solving presently unresolved disarmament issues

So there were outstanding issues but Blix felt that huge progress was being made. The Iraq war went ahead because Iraq was technically in violation and the people in question wanted war.

I would compare this to something like Azerbaijan paying about £10m a year to sponsor their country on Atletico Madrid's football shirts (!!!).

&gt;

&gt;The __Peter Principle__ is a concept in [management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management) theory in which the selection of a candidate for a position is based on the candidate's performance in their current role, rather than on abilities relevant to the intended role. Thus, employees only stop being promoted once they can no longer perform effectively, and ""managers rise to the level of their incompetence.""

I understand it's useful to be able to investigate people who aren't suspected of committing crimes, I just don't think it's right.

&gt;disposable email

&gt;It's likely that by the time you get to the end of your investigation, relevant data will have been deleted.


The law can't possibly solve this problem. What would you have ISPs do? store full packet capture for all traffic for a year? What if it's encrypted, and also, most of the time, content of the e-mail will not even help you find the sender. If you want the source IP of the sender, just have ISPs keep passive DNS that's timestamped.

&gt;trace the email, track the IP

I don't know what you're talking about, and I investigate malicious e-mails for a living. You either have the source IP or you don't. And what does tracking an IP do? Alert whenever you see traffic to/from that IP? good luck wading through the avalanche of legitimate traffic going to and from that webmail provider's ip, the content of which you can't/shouldn't be able to read because human rights do actually matter and nobody involved is suspected of a crime.

&gt;Do not assume this legislation is intended entirely for spooks to spy on you. Bits of it are really important for good old police officers to solve the sudden huge surge in online crime.

My complaint about it is that police will have access. Like it or not, GCHQ are supposed to do this shit, that's a whole other discussion ; but the police are not supposed to be able to breach your human rights without a warrant, and thus with some good reason to do so. I'm not committing any crimes, but my ISP is supposed to record all my connections, and possibly content? NO. Fucking No.

From [Britain turns its back on strong beer:](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/11455150/Britain-turns-its-back-on-strong-beer.html)

A Department of Health report shows that between 2011 and 2013 the number of units of alcohol sold has reduced by 1.9 billion.

Much of the fall is because the average strength of beer sold has fallen from 4.42 per cent to 4.14 per cent over the period, the report says.

The British Beer and Pub Association said brewers are responding to consumer demand, and Government decisions to offer tax relief on lower strength beers.

One of the changes, in 2011, meant lower tax on beers with 2.8 per cent alcohol or less.

Since then, a number of manufacturers have reduced the strength of best-selling products, and launched lower-alcohol products.

Carlsberg UK reduced the strength of its Skol lager from 3 per cent to 2.8 per cent, while Greene King launched a new product, Tolly English Ale, at 2.8 per cent.

Meanwhile, high strength-lagers Stella Artois, Budweiser and Becks have all been reduced from 5 per cent to 4.8 per cent, and John Smith’s Extra Smooth ale has fallen from 3.8 per cent to 3.6 per cent.

Jane Ellison, public health minister said that between them, more than 30 companies had removed 1.3 billion units of the alcohol from the market, by reducing the strength of their products.",null,0,null,1433495888,null,0,false,0,crwac7g,null,t3_38i5k2,null,t1_crwac7g,null,t1_crvkw9m,null,null,null,1436747037,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

Just thinking about it, my premiums are £88 a month fully comp right now. If I claim, I would loose my no claims for the year (which I have just had applied!) which would raise it to the former price of £136 a month. On top of that, it's likely to go up a bit more because I've had an accident - so think £150 (and I would say that's conservative). That's an extra £62 a month. It would take 8.3 months to pay for the tank, with my premiums next year being higher than they would have been pre-claim as well.

If you *can* afford £515, even after a few months of saving up, I would do it. I would only get insurance involved if the price was too much for me to stomach (ie bike writeoff/theft/major damage).

What I am not clear on (and my presumptions could be way out as a result here) is if bike insurers do up your premiums, even for a no-fault claim. Furthermore, I don't know what they would really do to your no claims bonus.

Like all of you I'm totally obsessed with the transfer market, been having a bit of fun on FIFA 15 trying to create my best and most realistic summer possible. Would love some feedback if you could check out what I came up with - maybe I'm ignorant but I don't know why they don't just do this:

Outgoings:
Sterling: 35MM
Balo: 8MM
Allen: 8MM
Lucas: 7MM
Coates: 6MM
Borini: 6MM
Aspas: 5MM
Lambert: 4MM
Enrique: 3MM
Alberto: 3MM

Total Outgoings = 85,000,000

Summer Transfer Budget = 30,000,000

Total Available = 115,000,000

Incomings:
Milner: Free
Ings: 5MM
Kovacic: 18MM
Clyne: 15MM
Kondogbia: 25MM
K. Navas: 10MM
Cheryshev: 8MM
Lacazette: 34MM

With this we've gotten rid of a tremendous talent in Sterling yet a complete malcontent as well as the rest of the dead weight on our squad.

In it's place we've picked up an exciting young CM in Kov, the CDM we've all been clamoring for in Kondog, a solid RB in Clyne, an up and coming winger in Cheryshev, a very solid keeper in Navas to challenge and hopefully overtake Migs and of course the coup de grace the pacy, tricky goal-scoring dynamo in Lacazette.

Of course Lacazette is the least likely of the group given his preference for CL football, but the point is a striker of his caliber somewhere in the range of 35-45MM is well within the range of reason if we manage our outgoings correctly (we can easily get a cheaper GK if we deem the striker a higher priority and free up an extra 6MM or so).

Even if Lacazette rebuffs our efforts - targets such as Vietto, Icardi, Jackson Martinez (less enthused about) and others can be had for less and we could keep some in the kitty to bolster the squad during the Jan window.

I'll readily admit I'm a novice at this - just an avid LFC fan from America who plays a ton of FIFA, reads the Echo and listens to the Anfield Index/Wrap so feel free to tell me if I'm way off the mark here, but I just don't see how it's so complicated.

That to some great extent Labour is an anachronism rooted in classism and industrial labour, phenomena which just don't exist in our postindustrial neoliberal society. What does exist is far higher inequality than has ever been in living memory. But where previously that inequality could be clearly associated with class, allowing a cohesive political movement to form, now it's far more atomised. It's temporary and casual workers, small business owners, un-unionised service industry workers. Rather than hundreds of people working on one factory floor, in the same union, who had a fraternal bond with their fellow workers in the next factory down the road. That's gone.

I think Miliband was on the right track making inequality and zero hours contracts a focus of his campaign. But I think the campaign was badly fought. Irrational blame for the financial crisis went unchallenged. The damage New Labour had done to the perception of Labour in Scotland was a ticking time bomb which went off at an inconvenient moment. And it was underestimated the extent to which Lib Dem supporters would rebel to the Tories.

Unless there's a crisis in public services brought about by Tory cuts it'll be difficult for any Labour party to challenge the Tory's appearance as more economically prudent or for Labour to advocate higher spending or higher taxes.

Well, I don't personally see the appeal. But it's naive to assume that others don't when thousands turn out to see them in the UK all the time. My Uncle has to work in Texas quite often, and during the Royal Wedding they held a *wedding party* at his office. They literally had the day off work. It is taken very seriously so don't act like it isn't just because you disagree. 

Sure you may have some anecdotal experience which suggests the opposite opinion from some people, but they are held in overwhelmingly positive light by the majority of the world. 

I really don't like the use of the word parasite to describe the Royal family. They *do* work their fair share rather than sitting in palaces all day long (whether you think the return on their work is fair or not is another matter).

Imagine growing up and not being able to pursue your choice in career because your position is already set for you. Meeting people every day you have no choice in meeting. Having every action in your life scrutinized. I'd rather have a normal life, money isn't everything.

Lambert imo is actually quite similar to Benteke except that Benteke is much quicker.

I think Benteke is exactly what we need right now.  We have an abundance of small pacey players but we have absolutely no one that is capable of being more physical and also makes intelligent runs.

Firstly, don't leave without work to go to, before or after finishing your notice. I know you didn't say that's what you're thinking but that's a terrible idea that might at some point pop into mind. It certainly did for me.

The most important thing is to finish your notice period, references are absolutely everything nowadays, I've never been asked to prove a qualification but references have always been heavily requested. If you can't prove what you say you've been doing over the last x amount of time that will look awful, and they'll know you either ditched your notice or (unlikely) think you've lied. You don't want either of those assumptions. 

I had eight weeks on mine and it did put the odd company off. But I was persistent in finding new work for months, and my persistence paid off when I found a company that was absolutely fine with my eight week notice, and also fine with my two weeks pre-planned leave just after a week of being there! That was with prior notice though. Love my new job, grass is definitely greener! Make sure you find the right place.

If a company is willing to wait that long, they're worth working the notice for.

That said, don't take any old shit.

In the 1990s, Islamists decried the West as evil for not intervening in Bosnia or Chechnya. In the previous decade they decried us as evil for intervening in Afghanistan after 9/11 and subsequently in Iraq. Now we're back to being decried as evil for not intervening in Syria. 

Of course, Islamists never thanked us for protecting Kuwait's independence and Kosovars, Bosniaks etc from genocide, and we won't receive thanks either if we try to be nice to them in future.

1. You can't say no to a drink if you're in a bar, so you just end up trashed every time
2. You can say no, but everyone around you turns into a drunken twat and you don't want to be there

If 1 is the answer, then you probably do have some level of problem with alcohol and may want to look at that.

So, really, its all about whether there is more political enthusiasm to support people who say they need help, or to monitor their honesty.

About 25 years ago I knew quite well a guy who was in charge of one of the fraud prevention teams. The way he explained it, at that time there were certain trades where it was commonplace for large numbers of people to both work and be signing on for dole - these included building sites, street markets, docks, restaurants and bars, and quite a few more where casual day rates were paid in cash. It was a long time ago, but IIRC his main focus was working with employers to get them to tighten up their record-keeping.

Again, a long time ago, I also used to work with a lad whose wife was an undercover fraud assessor - who basically followed people around to catch them ""in the act.""

Labour originally was a party for the workers.  To get these people solidly back I think you've got to put your money where your mouth is.  Instead of chatting shit about how the austerity is bad, or how UKIP people might be racist etc, they need to do things in each local area that help the people there directly, and talk about those things, and join those things up in their message to a countrywide effort.

Come election time it can sometimes seem the only time you've seen your prospective MP is when he or a party member knock on your door to see if you'll vote.  If come election time you knew the Labour guy because well, he was the guy that despite not even being elected had galvanised his party to help your area directly, then you've got a completely different situation.

If Labour decide they don't need to wait to be in power to directly act for good for people, I think they'd do great.  I also think this is the change that needs to happen in Scotland for people to change their attitude back.  They need to raise money amongst their members, volunteer, and spend the time and money in each constituency where it would make the most difference to people.  And they need to do without calling other people bigots or racists or toffs, or wanting to raise taxes.  It needs to be all about action, and the actions need to be consistent with the message of improving the country, which need to be consistent with policies for improving the country.  

Come the election they can say, well we weren't in power, but our members know you in the street to talk to you, and know your family, and a) cleaned up all the mess in Y park, b) staffed that closed training centre with volunteers and spent labour party money to keep it open ourselves, c) kept fifty families from being homeless by helping them financially and with advice, d) helped clear the wasteland at Z place so criminals didn't hang around in it, e) helped 300 families draw up a budget... etc.  You get the point.  And it needs to be painstakingly publicised on a drip-fed schedule, each month you get something through your door saying in the last month we did the following things to improve your area.

Furthermore we are NOT talking about warrants, we're talking about warrantless gathering and storage of information. The warrant might be needed to get the info, but still, this opens up a Pandora's box we can no longer close, and WILL be abused. The phone hacking scandal would not having happened if phones could not be hacked. 

It's like having all snail mail opened, photocopied and stored, just in case. Sorry, but no. Some things you're going to have to get by without. Because otherwise at some point that will be misused. I don't need the fucking Daily Mail reading my private anything.

You see, we also have to accept that sometimes criminals get away. But there seems to be a double standard in criminal justice. The paedophiles in government, business and entertainment we keep hearing about definitely are getting away (with child murder too allegedly)... so are those responsible for the financial fuckup we're in (they are actually wealthier while the poor get fucked due to the austerity needed to ""balance the books""). But when the crimes are from us riffraff, it's REALLY IMPORTANT to stop it. I mean, they're dealing marijuana for fuck's sake, think of our children!!! So much for justice. You trust this system with all your data?!? 

Privacy is one of those things that defines us as humans. We have individual thoughts and actions that we sometimes share, but often keep to ourselves, which we absolutely SHOULD NOT HAVE to share with anyone. Taking that away will be hugely detrimental to our psychology. If privacy means sometimes crimes go unsolved, so be it. I'm not giving up my personhood so your tabloid rag reading idiots can feel a bit safer and warmer inside. 

Some countries are willing to use torture to capture criminals. That's just another line, another right (the right to life and safety) removed in the name of security. We find that abhorrent, yet we're happy to throw another right out of the window, the right to privacy, for a flawed and corrupt justice system, in the name of that same elusive goal.

I would like to disagree with you regarding the possibility of success. While Soton massively overachieved this season, I still don't see how he is guaranteed more success at Liverpool now than possibly Man City or Man U in the near future.  He is already considered one of the the best English RBs around, and I don't see how playing for Liverpool will suddenly improve his position for England. 

I am just thinking from the perspective of Clyne. He could sign for Liverpool for the next 5 years right now, or he could renew his contract at Soton, continue performing brilliantly  and leave for a much more bigger club with a much more higher probability of success in the next 2-3 years.

null,false,Ordinary650,null,null,null,"Short answer - yes, I think it's difficult to claim ISIS as it exists today has no link to us deposing Saddam. But who knows how exactly Saddam would have handled things, another group directly rebelling against him was probably on the cards and would probably have the same members as ISIS.

Longer answer:

By removing Saddam we removed one of the key players in the region, who had enforced a sort of ""peace"" through military power (although I'm sure his victims would not be happy with the word peace). Saddam was good at suppressing groups he didn't like through brutal crackdowns, if both him and Assad were still still there acting to crush opposition then we almost certainly wouldn't see the ISIS we see today, but I think we would see multiple smaller groups because the sheer numbers willing to join would have had to be channelled somewhere.  

But it's all speculation. Would the Arab Spring have happened without the Iraq war? If it had, would it have toppled Saddam? Would Saddam have been able to keep Iraq united like Iran has managed? What would he have done in relation to the rebel groups in Syria? Where would all of the crazy young people joining IS have gone?

I think we hastened something which was probably inevitable, but by adding ourselves in to the mix, gave a unified target which drew disparate groups together and has resulted in IS - and we removed one of the main things blocking it, a brutal regime. I think we can draw a direct line between the Iraq war and ISIS, but I don't think we can say no other group would have emerged.",null,0,null,1433499707,null,0,false,0,crwb6by,null,t3_38nabm,null,t1_crwb6by,null,t3_38nabm,null,null,null,1437571119,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

But the regimes' brutality is what created the pressures which resulted in the collapse of the ""stable"" Arab dictatorships. Your really have to argue that Ba'athist Iraq was special in this regard rather than that it would be odd for it to have collapsed.

Let's say you aren't just someone casually interested in journalism, let's say you've been interested your whole life, have done interesting work, can already demonstrate good writing skills, and are prepared to do something novel to make the money come in (e.g. you have an idea for a new kind of website that will knock Buzzfeed off its perch). 

You want to go to a reputable course. I know two people who went to [City University](http://www.city.ac.uk/arts-social-sciences/journalism). I think it has the best reputation out of any journalism school. You should be more interested in the alumni and contacts the lecturers can offer you than the quality of the teaching or the course itself. The number of people with paid employment in journalism a year after the course ends should influence your decision.

I know two people who went to City. One of them works as a producer for the BBC and is a clear success. The other was a parliamentary assistant for a while, don't know where she's ended up now. The one who is successful in broadcast had been a special adviser for a political party. She had developed many contacts in politics, had great political nous, and is also really smart. Her career up to that point probably had more to do with her success than any journalism course.

The point I am trying to make is, even if you could be a success in journalism, the degree will not serve much purpose other than to give you some contacts and the space to start developing some clippings. There are a lot of other things that need to fall into place before you can make a career.


Remember, that's the advice for someone who is passionate about journalism and could have the talent and motivation to be a success at it. 

If you don't know in particular what you want to do for a living, getting into journalism is not going to help you.

Journalism is dying on its arse, in Britain faster than any other country. It's still needed but there's no model for paying for it. Traditional journalism jobs are disappearing in droves from respected news outlets and they are not being replaced at the same rate by jobs in new media. The industry is full of people who want to get into it and will work for free if necessary, not to mention the thousands of laid off hacks who are more experienced than you and genuinely good at their jobs who will be ahead of you in the queue for more work. 

I would take up skills where there is demand. If you are even mediocre you will be hired and have the chance to learn even more on the job while being paid. Skills such as programming or data analytics will be much more valuable to you and can be learned without needing to pay anyone. There is so much work in these fields now. Even if you don't think you are naturally blessed with the maths or the quant skillset required, those things will come in time as long as you are motivated. In the same vein, learning a new language will probably also enhance your prospects.

Depending on how old you are (e.g. early twenties), you might want to do your A-levels and an undergraduate degree and use that as a springboard to improve your prospects. I am applying to graduate entry to big companies now at the ripe old age of 28 and it's proving a promising way of being paid to train for a new career.

null,false,SurrealistSwimmer,null,null,null,"I have to say, this article really rubbed me the wrong way. Just because FSG aren't releasing press statements about the inner workings of LFC left, right and centre doesn't mean they are incompetent, as the author appears to imply. 

**1. How has the manager who failed on all of the targets for season been able to remain in his job?**

Well, call me crazy, but perhaps through the same process as anyone else not meeting targets who gets to keep their job does: an analysis of what went wrong, a credible plan of action to improve and, most importantly, a good prospect of targets being met in the future. 

**2. Who at the football club is qualified to make a decision on whether the manager remains in their job?**

This is just a cheap snipe. How many other football club owners were qualified 'football men' when they acquired their clubs? Who exactly do they envision would buy LFC? Guardiola? 

**3. When the current manager, assistant manager, first-team coach and goalkeeper coach were appointed to their roles at the club, the most any of them had was one season of Premier League experience. None had any experience in that role in the Champions League. Why hasn’t this lack of experience been addressed?**

Fair point, but isn't this being addressed as we speak, with the whole back room re-shuffle? I mean, come on chaps, the season's only just ended! 

**4. Why was there not a contingency plan in place for when Luis Suarez was sold? Going from targeting Alexis Sanchez and ending up with Mario Balotelli shows a clear lack of planning.**

Fair point, although I struggle to imagine they did this deliberately. Was there anyone of Suarez's calibre available and interested last summer? It appears not. But I agree, the striker position could have been handled better - I think we all feel that way and hopefully lessons have been learnt. 

**5. Who sanctioned the spending of £107 million, without acquiring any player remotely similar to Suarez’s attributes?**

See above. 

**6. Who determined that Dejan Lovren was worth spending £20 million on?**

Because every transfer ever works out. Look at Man City's or United's or Chelsea's record of expensive transfers that have all worked out. 

**7. Who is accountable for the failings of the 2014 summer transfer window? How is the person responsible still in a job?**

Yes, because the fact that John Henry hasn't sent you (or any of us, for that matter) a personal email detailing every aspect of the post-season review process and asking you for advice on who should be sacked is a clear sign that no review process took place. I'll just keep on refreshing my inbox - he must be writing it as we speak!

**8. Why has John Henry become less involved at LFC?**

Seriously?! 

Also: 

&gt; On that point, did nobody think it might have been an idea for somebody from the ownership to be present at the club’s greatest ever servant’s final game?

Perhaps because they're busy running a business and not a reality show. I'm rather sick and tired of these pointless acts of trying to out-tribute one another. Gerrard is gone. Gerrard was an excellent player and a club icon. But there's no reason to hold a fawning public procession every time he smells his last Scouse flower, drinks his last Scouse pint or takes his last Scouse dump. This sort of thing can be done in private too, you know. 

**9. Why do Liverpool, especially under FSG, continually fail to land their main transfer targets? And why is information so frequently leaked and briefed to the media?**

Because their main transfer targets usually seem to prefer more attractive clubs. Of course, we could just drop our expected standard of player. I can only imagine how chuffed you'd be about that. 

**10. How can a 2-hour meeting be heralded as one that provided an ‘end-of-season review’ and that formulated a “comprehensive plan for improvement” next season?**

Have you ever been to a meeting? Ever had to study material for a meeting? Send throngs of emails back and forth detailing what should be discussed and how? Discussed minutes and action plans after meeting? Do you really think FSG run LFC like a GCSE English class, with everyone just regurgitating what they pulled off Sparknotes ten minutes before class? 

Bloody hell, that got my blood boiling. I need a pint now.

null,false,r155,cnty-uk,Swansea/Bristol,null,"I posted this in the other thread, but here are a few reasons off the top of my head. 

It's undemocratic. How can we preach democracy and meritocracy when there's an undemocraticly head of state, who's only qualification for the position is heritage. Just because I'm the son of a tradesman, doesn't mean I'm automatically qualified to build loft conversations. Equally I'd assume anyone who supports the institution supports the HoL.

I understand that in reality the monarch does not use their political power, but the fact is there is room to is concerning. Even so, now we are seeing the spider memos, where Charles has attempted to influence government policy. In fact a democratically elected presidents does not necessarily need to have any powers, they could be ceremonial like Ireland. I will agree that for the most part, the Queen has been a good Head of State. But it still leaves the argument, why can't the public elect others that have the potential to do better. 

What bothers me the most is the blatant nepotism that is rampant. Just the other day I saw Prince William in an elevated position in the FA. And this isn't the only time, there are many examples of this. Although, fair play to Harry for doing a tour in Afghanistan, both Princes were given helicopter pilot training, which I find hard to believe both achieved on their own merit; but of course, for the most part this is just speculation on my part. Another peeve is the 'freebies' that even less important family members get. Just the other week I saw it reported that both Princess Beatrix and the other one (whose name alludes me) had been taking very expensive holidays off the backs of tax payers money.

The inequality in this country is only increasing and there's something not right when those on benefits are being scapegoated, while the royal family receive inordinate amounts of money from the government, for doing a 'job' that quite frankly any ordinary British family could do. There's little evidence to suggest that the family are profitable, which leaves room to suggest that they are a burden on the tax payer. I apologise for the lack of citations, but I'm on my phone, rushing this response.

But I hope you can see my point of view. Even so, if they were profitable, the whole system of nepotism is undemocratic, unmeritocratic and down right unjustified. The queen derives her right to rule from God, which brings up entirely different arguments. I know the UK is meant to be a CoE state, however this argument is absurd from a secularist point of view.

There is little to suggest the Royals bring in revenue from tourism. The Castles and palaces will still remain and would be able to be opened to the public to further gain tourism profit. To suggest people only visit the UK for the royals is absurd; London is possibly the most known and famous city in the world with thousands of sights. Look at France, the tourist capital of the world, it's not the family that brings in the money, it's the institution that can be historically preserved. Of course there are many other factors that boost France's tourism. Regardless, to suggest we keep an undemocratic system of government to get a few million a year in tourism revenue- which on a macro economic scale is tiny- is in my opinion stupid.

Like I said, I apologise for the lack of citations. But I'd be interested to know why you presumably support them. ",null,0,null,1433500645,null,0,false,0,crwbe39,null,t3_38mrx2,null,t1_crwbe39,null,t1_crw9444,null,null,null,1436747906,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

Science is going to tell us how best to make everyone happy? As a trained scientist, I think you're placing too much faith in science there mate. You're talking about dictating how peoples lives should be lived, you can't just say ""Well we did a study and it shows chocolate = more happy"". Until we can model the entire universe accurately as a simulation and *then* make predictions and projections based on that, we're going to get it wrong.

Well actually I'm not sure about Man U's rb situation but they had interest in Clyne and then withdrew it, so Liverpool are the biggest club that Clyne is going to get at the moment. You're also seriously understating the stature of LFC. They are the 8th richest club in the world, and have an enormous fan base. Whilst Liverpool may not have had abundant success recently, don't forget we were in the Champions league this season and are the most likely to disrupt the current top 4 next year if that happens. It's not like any team other than Chelsea is so far ahead of Liverpool that the prospect of us finishing around them is as far fetched as you make it seem (2nd last year for example).Liverpool would pay far higher wages than Soton, even if he renewed his contract, so until he got that move to a ""much more bigger club"" as you put it, which in reality, there aren't that many of, then Clyne would personally be missing out on millions over the course of his contract, even if it's 50k per week that soton pay him the 70 or 80k a week he would most likely get at LFC would be far better to him financially. As you already said, Soton overachieved massively this season, and lets be honest, does anyone really see them  doing this again? If soton drop down to the levels that were the 'expected' ones for them then does Clyne really want to stay there? Furthermore it's pretty well recorded that simply playing for a bigger club helps your chances internationally, even to the extent where shitty players get into the England squad just because they play for a top team (a la Cleverley).",null,0,null,1433500838,null,0,false,0,crwbfqn,null,t3_38kwh0,null,t1_crwbfqn,null,t1_crwb5iu,null,null,null,1436747937,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

&gt; Why has a manager who failed to meet targets been able to keep his job?

Because, fundamentally, things don't work in black and white terms like that. Targets for the season are things you want to achieve, they're goals that should be met and where you need a solid reason if you haven't met them, but there's not some kind of do-or-die ultimatum. Targets frequently aren't met in the real world - god forbid anyone working in a role where failure to meet targets or budgets for even a single year is a sackable offence, especially when there are so many circumstances not under their direct control. 

If you fail to meet targets then it means clearly something went wrong and that needs to be looked at and learnt from, but the solution doesn't have to involve people losing their jobs. Why Rodgers is still here is a valid question in itself, but implying that targets are a minimum requirement to retain the job rather than a potentially optimistic target is a bit ridiculous. 

&gt; How can a 2-hour meeting be heralded as one that provided an ‘end-of-season review’ and that formulated a “comprehensive plan for improvement” next season? 

I've seen plenty done within 2-hour business meetings before now. Defining scope for multi-million pound projects, budget negotiations, deciding to cancel a project with hundreds of thousands of pounds of investment behind it that wasn't looking like going anywhere. FSG and the like are experienced and successful businessmen - two hours is plenty if you're organsed and have done the proper preparation beforehand. And there's almost certainly been plenty of discussion and contact in the last few months between the parties involved besides just that two hour face-to-face meeting. 

&gt; And why is information so frequently leaked and briefed to the media?

Funny that this whole article simultaneously criticises FSG for allowing the club to leak so much to the media, while  asking a bunch of questions which require answers that would reveal quite a lot of the inner workings of the club to the public. Most of the questions asked here FSG *will* know the answers to. Whether they want the fans and therefore general public to know them is a different matter.

null,false,bloop24,lfc99,,null,I completely agree.  Almost all of the questions appeared either not thought out or just a knee jerk reaction to a disappointing end to the season.  Yes Rodgers missed all his stated targets etc. but he hasn't done anything deserving of just being shipped off without regard to whether there is a suitable replacement available.  The general feeling from most people I have talked to is that they wanted him to stay unless there was a top manager available that was willing to come.  I even slightly disagree on their point about not directly replacing Suarez.  What our squad more than anything needed this season was some added depth which we accomplished.  I imagine Sturridge was seen as the replacement to Suarez and yes we should have gotten a better striker than Balotelli in but no one could have foreseen just how poor he has been.  I also think if we hadn't brought in as many players as we did that we would have done even worse at the start of the season when we were in the Champions League and had to deal with so many congested matches.

But he also went to two semi-finals, had Madrid in the CL group as well as Basel (a team perennially in the tournament) while dealing with a whole bunch of other issues that weren't his fault (Sturridge injury, Mignolet's form, lack of CL experience, etc.)  Liverpool aren't Madrid that can sack every manager that doesn't win something every year.  

2.  This question doesn't make sense.  They fired Kenny at the right time, it also seems quite likely that they thought about sacking Rodgers.  I've never heard someone ask for qualifications from someone that can fire them.  

3.  None of them had any experience in the CL because you hired BR (who seems to need control over these things) to get you into contention for CL not to win the bloody thing.  Rodgers' appointment was to transform the team into a sustainable, yet competitive team.  It seems like with Rodgers he needs to pick his guys.

4.  The writer even mentions the two other options Remy and Bony as potential replacements for Suarez.  Both would have been great.  I loved the Remy signing and Bony was scoring for fun this year.  There were options for replacements.  It doesn't show a clear lack of planning it shows a clear lack of options after the media for Remy fell apart.  They got bullied out of the Bony move by Swansea asking for 20 mil.  (A lot of people in this sub were against getting him for that much)

5. The two forwards he is referring two I suppose is Lambert (signed before Suarez left) and Balotelli because Origi was meant to be instantly loaned out.  The main aim of spending all that money was to strengthen the squad as a whole / youth /potential.  I do agree with this question though it is irritating to not know who is making decisions.  Before we could all just blame Comolli.  

6. I agree but hindsight.  I don't remember anyone saying it was a disaster signing at the time.

7. Aside from Balotelli and Lovren I don't think the window was as catastrophic as everyone is making it seem.  But playing into the writer's hands, that is the way a committee works.  No one personally is responsible.  If it is 5 people and three all agreed with buying Lovren, say, was a good move but those same 3 people also made the Can move do you fire them anyway?  A committee means dividing up responsibility and therefore blame.  

8.  He is an owner, he probably doesn't know shit about football.  For all we know it is a good thing he isn't involved in the club.  He spends money and is doing great things for the club.  They don't have TV's in Boston?

9.  They fail because of a few reasons.  Lack of consistent CL football, wage structures, locations Sanchez :( , and price.  Mkhitaryan sucked this year for Dortmund so might have been a blessing, we bid for Costa before anyone had heard of him and almost signed him, Depay loves LvG.  The cold hard truth is that there are other clubs like Chelsea, Arsenal, City and United that are more attractive than LFC right now.  

10.  Why take two hours to say we fucked up boss?  It probably went like this.  ""Hey John, sorry about not getting CL this year.  Or any trophy.  But there is always next year am I right?""

The Royals own land, yes, but the obvious question is, ought they to own that land? Have they a right to it? How did they come by it? The answer is that their ancestors acquired it by force. 

It's not an argument in their favour to say that they have assets, because the *only reason* that they own those assets is because their ancestors did, or because their ancestors were wealthy. It's not because of any merit that they themselves have, or any work that they themselves have done. 

The mere ownership of something does not suffice to not make you a parasite. Far from it. 

Expropriating land and assets from unproductive and exploitative people is the easiest thing in the world to justify. You justify it on the grounds that 1, the British people built, maintained, and should therefore own it. 2, the current occupants got it unjustly, through force or exploitation.

I also spent a prolongued period of time mocking all of my vegetarian friends, because I was an arsehole at the time (obviously, it has continued to this day). As a result, I have an instinctive reaction with a lot of stuff that I don't like it, which has lead to a very conservative palate where I just eat what I used to eat, but in Quorn or the like form.

After five years of this, with a hole in my soul that only bacon could possibly fix, I have started trying the stuff that I used to dislike. I'm finding that by and large, I actually like it.

On the plus side, more good food to eat. On the negative, I'm now the sort of person who eats couscous and hummous like a, *shudders in horror* Guardian reading vegan hipster arsehole *visually grimaces*. I've basically turned into everything I spent a couple of decades mocking.

So your solution is just to seize the land? OK. This ""you only have it because your ancestors did"" thinking is pretty shaky. So if your inherit anything from your parents it should just revert back to the state since you didn't buy it yourself? More people will lose houses and other possessions from that policy than just the royal family. 

Yes the land was taken by force 1000 years ago. That's how the world used to work. You cant give back anything that has ever been taken by force since the dawn of history, because that would apply to nearly everything.

As for tourism, it's not binary, people would still visit London without the royals like they still visit Saint Petersburg, the question is in the exact numbers. People abroad are undeniable fascinated by our royal family and even if your right that we'd still get the same number of tourists without them its still an unnecessary risk for no benefit.

Amazing car, never had a problem in the 3 years I owned it, but I couldn't sell it and eventually had to let it go for £850 (I had to sell when the economy was bad, and due to high insurance costs, plenty of those cars floating about etc, no one wanted it).

null,false,sometimesihelp,null,null,null,"Costs per trade are often called ""dealing"" charges/costs and are listed in the Monevator article under the ""Dealing: ETFs &amp; shares"" column. It can be either a flat amount or a percentage of the assets being bought/sold (or sometimes a percentage amount with a minimum/maximum spread). These are only paid when you make a deal, i.e. buy or sell. Some brokers have cheaper dealing costs for ""regular investing"", there is a column on the table for that too.

On top of that the various platforms also charge an annual fee which is either flat-fee or a percentage fee of total assets, or again sometimes a hybrid. The tables on the Monevator site are split with flat fee in the top table and percentage based brokers on the bottom table. These are ongoing and paid every year - higher value portfolios usually benefit from flat fees whereas smaller portfolios usually benefit from percentage based fees.

Then you have the costs of the underlying funds/ETFs themselves. Sometimes there is an upfront load which is a one-off fee and then there is an Ongoing Management Charge charged on an annual basis.

For example:

* The Vanguard Lifestrategy Funds tend to have an initial charge of 0.10% with ongoing charges of 0.24%
* The Vanguard FTSE 250 ETF has an ongoing charge of 0.10%

So to cap it off. If you had £1000 you wanted to invest in a Vanguard Lifestrategy Fund (VLS) with Charles Stanley Direct (CSD) you would pay a dealing charge of £10 leaving you £990 to actually buy funds with. After the initial Vanguard one-off fee you would get £989.01 worth of index funds. 

Then assume you get growth of 4.00% you would have a portfolio worth £1028.57 from which Vanguard would take their £2.47 ongoing charge and CSD would take their £20.00 platform fee leaving you with roughly £1006.10. In reality these are probably not taken a lump sums but throughout the year.

CSD were picked not picked for a specific reason, for an ETF portfolio, or a portfolio of that size they probably aren't the cheapest. Returns of 4.00% were also an example figure, obviously it varies. Hopefully it gives you an idea of the various charges involved. A large number of people, usually styled as Bogleheads after John Bogle, the founder of Vanguard, advocate seeking out broad allocations in low cost vehicles.

But it's not total and shameless bollocks.  They might seek to get money from him because they have had to hire at short notice which they wouldn't have had to do had he served his notice period, for example.  In that case it might say:

'due to your not working your agreed notice period we have incurred costs greater than the amount of pay that was due to you, as a result of having to hire short notice agency staff and the previous work not being handed over.  While we have deducted this from your wages, we still have a shortfall of £2500, which we expect you to pay as you agreed to in your contract.  Please call us to arrange payment'.

And then if you ignored that one, maybe the next one would threaten court action.  And then if you ignored that one... etc.

In all likelihood this won't happen, but depending on OP's job, it could easily.  He signed a contract, the idea being that OP agreed to those terms.  What happens depends on the context which we don't have.

null,false,Ordinary650,null,null,null,"&gt;This is almost certain. The Arab Spring is the result of changing demographic, educational, and economic conditions, in a context of incompetent, unaccountable, and unacceptably brutal States. A Shia Spring would have been likely in Iraq, I think, in a mirror image of Syria.

I'm not so convinced, the huge instability in the region off the back of the Iraq war can't be ignored as a contributing factor. I think an Shia spring in Iraq would have been far more brutally oppressed by Saddam than Assad managed - and also Assad had the problem of an essentially lawless country on his border allowing rebels to consolidate and hide. If both had acted in concert to crush the dual uprisings?! I shudder to think of the carnage. 

Ironically, that crackdown probably would have forced the West to intervene, and without the Iraq war experience to discourage us, we would have done it.

&gt;But the regimes' brutality is what created the pressures which resulted in the collapse of the ""stable"" Arab dictatorships. Your really have to argue that Ba'athist Iraq was special in this regard rather than that it would be odd for it to have collapsed.

It was, in that it was far more brutal in cracking down on protest and opposition than any of the other regional dictatorships. He gassed his own citizens.

&gt;The only real long term solution to sectarian warfare in the Middle East is the construction of pluralist states which respect human rights - democracies. Authoritarianism is a shallow solution, and brittle in 2015.

This is the same old mistake being made again and again I'm afraid, Arab culture is fundamentally different to Western culture and our attempts to ""force"" democracy have either failed (Iraq), led to corrupt states (Afghanistan), or in the case of Palestine led to a result we ""didn't like"".

Arab states have to move themselves towards democracy. Us going there and telling them it's the best way to work things is actually likely to discourage them. These are fundamentally different cultures, our whole mistake is thinking western values are universal.

For example one of the huge mistakes in Iraq was Bremer refusing to deal with tribal and religious leaders, believing only in the democratic vote - what a blunder.

One big reason is probably the kind of people who end up getting in - it can be very difficult if you've always strived to be the best out of your peer group to adjust to Oxford.

Yes, Oxford is hard, and Finals might be the hardest thing you will ever do. Most people however do very well and thrive under the pressure. You will leave Oxford with a fantastic education, and hopefully a great experience of university life.

Twats like the person you were talking to are part of a very Oxford stereotype you'll find in most colleges who act out their performance by denigrating the University and insisting that everybody secretly hates the University, especially to outsiders. It's a form of intellectual snobbery which you might notice is also self-flattering - '*Oxford is* ***so*** *horrible and you probably don't have the chops to do it, but I stuck it out (and will reap the benefits thereafter)*'.

Every so often the Guardian produces an article written by one of its many Oxbridge educated staff claiming to resent Oxford and everything it has done for them. The comments you were responding to are the nascent stage of those irritating articles and attitudes.

For example, their reference to clothes is a result of them being pissed off that Oxford voted overwhelmingly to keep sub-fusc for examinations. It's very unlikely you'll actually be fined (I got caught out wearing bright pink socks for Politics of the European Union and was told off, and that was it), and their distaste for academic dress stems from it being quintessentially Oxford and therefore something which must be denigrated to people from outside the University to establish their credentials as ""anti-Oxford Oxford-student"", rather than something pre-freshers should be legitimately worried about.

You'll probably love Oxford, honestly.

1. Hand in your notice and start looking. Keep it quiet from any prospective employers as it doesn't help you with salary negotiations.

2. Negotiate. Either a shorter notice period with your current employer or maybe some staggered handover between both. Say 2 days a week in one job, 3 in the other.

3. Be upfront to prospective employers, a decent employer will wait for you if they feel you're the right candidate.

4. Hand in your notice with your current employer then get yourself signed off. If you don't receive sick pay from your current place and don't claim ssp you're not technically doing anything *that* wrong.

5. Just go anyway. They might send you threatening letters about breach of contract but fuck 'em, they probably won't follow it through.

4 and 5 i really wouldn't recommend unless you've really had your fill of the place and are happy to burn bridges. After sorting out decent references with friendly colleagues obviously :)

* The police federation will now be subject to the FOIA.

* Time limits on police bail. It's become common in England for the police to put suspects on bail for a few years, during which time they can't go on holiday, move house, or get car insurance etc. The govt wants to limit this to 28 days.

&gt; Riding two abreast also allows the motorist to overtake the group of cyclists quicker as there is less distance between the front and rear of the group (about half!!). This means that the motorist is past the group in less time, spending less time on the other side of the road and along side the group of cyclists and therefore safer all round.

Which is disingenuous, you'd be incorrect either way.

They did a fairly comprehensive study during that whole, '50% super tax' debacle a few years ago. Basically it seems to support that the laffer curve is not only defensible in the real world, but that we are already nearing the equilibrium point. That said, I would imagine there would be a short term gain from a tax hike although that is just conjecture and I can't back it up. 

There was an hmrc review of the 50% tax rate that was inconclusive, BUT did suggest that 50% did raise around a billion of additional revenue (although they confess that the range of uncertainly implies that it isn't a definitive figure). Obviously this supports your claim and contradicts mine so in true reddit style I 'should' suppress it but as this is genuinely unknown macro territory and you seem like a nice guy/girl I may as well post it too!
