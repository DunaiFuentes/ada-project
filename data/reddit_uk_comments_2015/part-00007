Cleopatra used clay from the Nile River and the Arabian Desert over 1800 years ago, as part of her beauty ritual. German and roman spas have been using clay packs and treatments in the spas they built 4,000 years ago. Many of these spas still exist and use clay even today. Pliney the elder devoted an entire chapter of his natural history"" to the many uses of clay for pimples, black heads and skin tightening. Many famous naturopaths, such as kuhn, just and kneipp have contributed to the revival of the uses of clay through their natural treatments for arthritus and skin ailments. Aztec Indian healing clay a brief history - the world’s most powerful facial the use of clay with apple cider vinegar can be dated back to the southern French priest of the16th century, kneipp, and his natural treatments using clay packs and poultices. Throughout history the use of clay, specifically green clay or bentonite, is well documented. To learn more about clay, look for ""our earth our cure"" by Raymond Dexteit, translated by Michel Abehsera in your local health food store or book store. Aztec secret Indian healing clay is bentonite clay from Death Valley, California, where it is sun- dried for up to six months in temperatures that sometimes reach 134 degrees. Facials, acne, body wraps, clay baths, foot soaks, chilled clay for knee packs and insect bites. Enjoy the benefits of clay in your own home. Beautify and refresh.""

**About you:** Acne-prone skin that is extremely dry. Need a exfoliator that doesn't worsen blemishes or slows down healing. I mix it with a 50-50 with vinegar and water. The vinegar I use is a Polish one and is 10% (instead of the normal 5%). I use this product on a clean face and then I go into the shower to remove it. I massage my face so the clay comes off instead of peeling chunks of it off.

**Your opinion:** Great powerhouse exfoliator. I whip this out when I know my daily-use AHA/BHA won't clear up the huge flakes on my face. I like to use it directly after a workout. I slap the mask on, eat something, and then strip down and then do my post-workout shower. The shit on the container makes it feel like a gimmicky-product, so I  keep it out of sight.

&gt;

&gt;__Carlo Cudicini__ (Italian pronunciation: [ˈkarlo kudiˈtʃini]; born 6 September 1973) is an Italian [goalkeeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football\)) who is currently a [free agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent). He is the son of the former [AC Milan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan) goalkeeper [Fabio Cudicini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabio_Cudicini), and the grandson of [Circolo Sportivo Ponziana 1912](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circolo_Sportivo_Ponziana_1912) defender Guglielmo Cudicini.

&gt;Cudicini started his professional career at [Serie A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serie_A) side [AC Milan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan) in 1992, but struggled to break into the first team, and spent the 1993–1994 season on loan to [Como](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Como_Calcio_1907), making six league appearances for the club. He switched permanently to [Prato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Prato) in 1995, and made 30 league appearances for the club, before moving again to [Lazio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.S._Lazio) in 1996. Having only made a single league appearance for Lazio, he moved again in 1997, this time to [Castel di Sangro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castel_di_Sangro_Calcio). He made fourteen league appearances in a three-year spell at the club, before being loaned to English [Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League) side [Chelsea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.) for the 1999–2000 season. He signed permanently for the English club in 2000, and quickly dislodged [Ed de Goey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_de_Goey) from the number one spot, being voted Chelsea's Player of the Year for the [2001–02 season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Premier_League_2001-02), and the [ITV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_(TV_network\)) Premiership Goalkeeper of the Season for the [2002–2003 season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Premier_League_2002-03). However, he struggled with injury for the following season, and [Petr Cech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petr_Cech) was signed in 2004; Cech would displace Cudicini as the number one goalkeeper, with Cudicini only appearing sporadically afterwards. In 2006, both Cech and Cudicini suffered head injuries in a game against [Reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_F.C.); as Cudicini recovered sooner, and third-choice goalkeeper [Henrique Hilário](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrique_Hil%C3%A1rio)'s form dipped, he briefly took over the starting role, until Cech returned towards the end of January 2007. Cudicini left Chelsea in 2009, having made 141 league appearances for the club, and joined local rivals [Tottenham Hotspur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.). At Tottenham, he remained second-choice or third-choice throughout his spell, and only made 19 league appearances for the club; first [Heurelho Gomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heurelho_Gomes), then [Brad Friedel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Friedel) and [Hugo Lloris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Lloris) kept him out of the team. He left the club in 2012, having made 19 league appearances. In 2013, Cudicini signed for Los Angeles Galaxy.

&gt;Cudicini played 20 times for the [Italy under-18 team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy_national_under-18_football_team) between 1990 and 1992, and made a single appearance for the [under-21 team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy_national_under-21_football_team) during the 1992–1993 season; however, he never played for the full [national team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy_national_football_team). In 2003, during his successful period at Chelsea, the [English FA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_Association) attempted to select him for the [England national team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team), but he was ineligible.

Possibly, some may actually record the trip - but my understanding is that unless you have a stand-alone one with a trip logging function, this sort of thing generally doesn't default to on.

The exception is some of the latest ""online"" sat navs, which monitor your location when driving, and periodically ping a server to see if there are any traffic incidents in the vicinity. These may or may not hold a log on the device, and the server may or may not be able to match a ping to a specific sat nav unit.

Some of the latest technology (such as the waze navigation app) actually tracks all journeys, and uses it to automatically collect road speed information, traffic information and missing or changed roads. For example, if the app detects you suddenly driving through a field, it will transmit a deviation message to the server. If a dozen of people start driving through the same field, the servers will automatically add the road to the map, and flag it for a manual check (and manual entry of the road name, etc.) prior to uploading the corrected map to all the devices.",null,0,null,1420574765,null,0,false,0,cngh8ew,null,t3_2ri3w4,null,t1_cngh8ew,null,t1_cng3n9g,null,null,null,1425024982,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

It's not that people unanimously agree on everything (take a look at the more serious threads to see for yourself) 

It's not a con at all; the current Health Minister and his predecessor were both vehemently against abortion in all circumstances, and cases of pregnancy through rape do occur and even more common is instances of foetal abnormality which, if carried through would have serious implications for the mother even as far as endangering her life, so it's hardly a farce. 

The fact that women have to travel to the rest of the UK for treatment which should be available here is the real farce. We can receive the same treatment for cancer and other such illnesses/diseases here in Northern Ireland, but not abortion. Why should we be any different, if we're all part of the UK afterall? 

&gt; If our law is changed here how many abortions will be be carrying out here..... Thousands? How does that work then?

Now you're just being ridiculous. This is not a ""slippery slope"". This is aligning Northern Irish law with the law of the rest of the UK, or at least saving the life of one human being when two may be lost. Your statement above is something one would read in the comments section of the Daily Mail. 

Cutting care services to the elderly will decrease the amount of humans in our society; longer waiting times to get treatment at hospitals and A&amp;E departments will decrease the amount of humans in our society; health cuts in general will decrease the amount of humans in our society. At least this proposal would help save the life of a mother or the victim of rape from having to keep a constant reminder of what I can only imagine to be the worst experience ever.

**Product claims:** ""A weightless, ultra-sheer SPF50 broad spectrum UVA/UVB protection that is optimal for daily use.

Provides an optimum residue-free, transparent finish and is ideal for use alone or under makeup. Fortified with anti-oxidants (green tea, vitamin E and Co-Q10) and organic UV absorbers. Contains no oil, fragrance, alcohol or parabens.
Formulated with long lasting Avobenzone (Parsol 1789) superior singlet photo-stabilization technology.""

**About you:** Acne-prone skin that is extremely dry. I tan very well so when I get blemishes that are exposed to sunlight they turn dark and stay dark for a long time. Sunscreen if very important and I need a product that can go one application all day. I'm also strapped for time in the morning and need a product that isn't greasy so I can layer on makeup.

**Your opinion:** Great sunscreen. This sunscreen if very water-like in texture and requires a good shake before use. The sunscreen is absorbed into the skin for under a minute. Like all sunscreens, it needs to be re-applied after excessive touching, towelling, or water. It can sting a bit when in the eyes. I think it's worth the cost as you don't need a ton for a good application and it saves you time in the morning.

null,false,MrFlabulous,,Glorious People's Republic Of Asbostan,null,"My opinion?

1) Scrap private firms providing the basic services: food, cleaning, laundry. Keep it all in house.

2) Better wages for nurses, biomedical scientists, radiographers and the like. Better working conditions, job prospects etc. Make them feel liek they're worth a damn.

3) Stop treating paramedics like shit. Let them rest, let them do their joibs when they are not exhausted and likely to make mistakes. Pay them better, recruit more. Stop all these ""high alert"" shifts and try and limit call outs for drunks...

...speaking of which

3b) Have dedicated weekend staff who only deal with the special brew crowd. Work with the police more closely and set up hot spots in major towns and cities to deal with the casualties of inebriation. But that would be funded separately, by councils preferably.

4) No more idiotic blue sky projects like the computer database fiasco. If you want a database then buy something in that's already established, don't contract out something like that to a company that doesn't give a damn.

5) I was going to say better triage units but I think they are already as good as a free service can manage. The main hold up in terms of waiting times is the miscommunication between departments. An example: if there is more than one underlying condition that needs treating then the main sticking point is getting different departments to work together to fix the problem, e.g. an oncologist and a thoracic surgeon need to get together to discuss lung tumour removal, but getting the two of them into the same room is well nigh impossible for one reason or another. This is one of the root causes of long waiting times. Yet these days everyone can share a calendar, how come such a basic thing seems to be ignored? Grr. Certainly while I was working at Hammersmith Hospital I found this departmental misalignment to be a chronic problem that could have easily been fixed by having someone bang some heads together.

6) Which leads me to multi-layered management and bureaucracy: it would be fine if tha managers and directors actually *managed* and *directed*, but what leadership they do provide seems to be geared more towards trusts and budgets. Privatisation would make this worse, as what private company actually gives a shit about sick people? More later. In the meantime get these fools and bastards organising their departments efficiently and encourage cross-departmental communication. It doesn't cost anything, yet it's missing from many NHS departments.

Privatisation would be a disaster on all counts. Would Serco honestly give a shit if you had a kidney stone? Of course not, what they care about is if you've got the cash to get it removed. You think Sodexho would take out your appendix and send you on your way with a smile? Certainly not, they would limit the number of sutures in your tum, give a single shot of antibiotics and discharge you. Woe betide you if you develop a secondary infection, you're gonna need a bigger bank balance.

Private health care is fine if people can afford it, but as soon as the NHS opens its remaining doors to the private firms it will all go horribly wrong. With the disastrous sell offs in recent years as an example, how on earth with NHS privatisation benefit anyone other than the Eton mob and their chums?

What is missing from the upper levels of the NHS is the idea of patient care. That includes NICE, which continually fails; it was supposed to prevent the postcode lottery, but has not been able to do so. There is too much focus on cost, and while I agree that a degree of cost-effectiveness is needed there is so little sympathy from NICE and the professional bodies supporting it to allow people to believe that their health is the first concern of a so-called health service.

/u/Zanza_N, I'd be very interested to know if and how the NHS has treated you. I'd like to know if you think you can afford private care should you need it, and what experiences you have (if any) can be compared with those of the NHS (if any). I would make a guess here and say you are between 18-25, in which case your experiences are likely to be fewer than mine (in 40's, ex rugby player, history of chronic back and neck problems, hiatus hernia, IBD and gastric ulcer). I've been in Sweden for 3 years so I have some experience of their health system as well, and I can tell you stright away that theirs is nothing to write home about either.

You're deluded if you think that subsidising a 200 million deal is worth it for either Adidas or Turkish Airlines. There's not evidence based benefit. Whereas there is for a shirt sponsorship and there is for Adidas to be selling the biggest clubs in Asia if they're looking to expand in territories already dominated by Li Ning and Nike as far as sportswear goes.

Secondly Adidas make money on every Man U shirt they sell. They make very little specifically based on Messi in any tangible benefit.

Messi doesn't expand on that specifically by moving to Chelsea.

As you can see, all of this is purely financial. And frankly, most things are financial. Anything and everything, anything you can simply class as a deal has a cost benefit analysis. This doesn't pass it. Besides which, Adidas have already weighed it up as Bayern being the preferred destination for an uber star because they're also German and they have a stake in Bayern so would actually benefit commercially from him directly should he add to the success.

Oh and then factor in the Adidas deal doesn't really have very long to run, they're definitely not going to do it without a new deal.

Don't be an idiot about the money. We can't afford it. It might not be the only reason, but it's a pretty hefty reason against this transfer.

They don't want to sell him for any price.  With that said the 5 most exspensive transfers ever were all made by the spanish teams, infact, 7 of the top 10 all time are spanish teams.  The exceptions being Cavani, Falcao, and Di Maria.  The 2 french teams are in hot water with FFP and can't afford to get involved with Messi, that leaves Man United.  They could afford to pay whatever for Messi but I just don't see it.  Due to the fact that the highest payers of transfer fee's aren't options for this sale I believe his price would be significantly less.  With FFP there are only a few clubs in the world that can even afford those kind of wages, those clubs are Chelsea, Man United, maybe City, Arsenal, and the Spanish Giants but he is leaving one and no chance he goes to the other.  The truth is that due to Messi's wages and the FFP situations of PSG and Man City there isn't that much competition bidding for Messi.  

I think that if Messi is sold it will be due to him forcing his way out and Barcelona will have to settle for what they can get.  I think that what they could get would be something between 50 and 85m pounds.

&gt;CJ382 For the vast majority of women in the criminal justice system, solutions in the community are more appropriate. Community sentences must be designed to take account of women’s particular vulnerabilities and domestic and childcare commitments. The restrictions placed on sentencers around breaches of community orders must be made more flexible.

&gt;CJ383 Existing women’s prisons should be replaced with suitable geographically dispersed, small, multi-functional custodial centres. More supported accommodation should be provided for women on release to break the cycle of repeat offending and custody.

&gt;CJ384 Pregnant women in prison are particularly vulnerable and the scheme provided by the charity Birth Companions, which visits pregnant prisoners once a week, stays with them through birth and gives them support afterwards, should be extended to all women who wish to use it, with government funding.

&gt;CJ385 Prisoners should have improved access to meaningful activities, particularly real work and education and artistic and creative facilities. Particular efforts should be focused on ensuring all prisoners attain levels of literacy sufficient to allow them to function effectively in modern society.

null,false,vBrad,null,null,null,"**Steven Gerrard has admitted he would have signed a contract extension at Liverpool had it been offered to him last summe**r and is expected to agree an 18-month deal with LA Galaxy in the next 48 hours.

**Liverpool did not open talks with Gerrard over a new deal until November and by then the captain had established in discussions with the manager, Brendan Rodgers, that he would no longer be an automatic selection if he stayed beyond this season. Unwilling to become a squad player, the 34-year-old announced last week that he would leave when his deal expires in the summer.**

Confirmation that Los Angeles is to be his next destination appears to be imminent. He is expected to be given a basic salary of £4m per year by the Major League Soccer club – about £76,000 per week, with image rights inflating that figure. That equates to around half of what he is earning at Anfield.

“**If a contract had been put in front of me in pre-season I would have signed it,” Gerrard told the Liverpool Echo. “I’d just retired from England to concentrate all my efforts on Liverpool. I didn’t want my club games to be tailored. My injury record had been fantastic for the past two and a half years and I had a great season from a personal point of view last season. It’s all ifs, buts and hindsight now. That period between the summer and the end of November gave me thinking time.**

“There’s no blame and I’m not angry about it. There are other people in the squad and the club had other things to worry about. Liverpool Football Club have been unbelievable for me since I was eight years old. This club has helped me fulfil my dreams over and over again.”

Although Gerrard insists his decision to part company with Liverpool has been “very amicable”, the admission that he would have signed an extension had one been on the table in the summer raises fresh questions over Fenway Sports Group’s handling of the situation.

**Rodgers stated in pre-season that a new deal for Liverpool’s captain of the past 11 years was “a formality”, only to concede later in the campaign, when no offer was forthcoming, that Gerrard had a “life decision” to make.** The Liverpool manager categorically denied that money was a factor in Gerrard’s reluctance to commit and his anticipated basic salary at LA Galaxy supports that view. The midfielder confirmed that the prospect of having his game time cut, outlined to him by Rodgers in November, was a key factor in his decision not to renew.

**“I’ve got to be honest,” Gerrard said. “That chat with Brendan came earlier than I was expecting. It was tough but I understood.” He added: “When it gets to the stage where you don’t know if you’re going to be starting or not it becomes different. I’ve never wanted to be a squad player. If I was missing games now, I’d be sitting out even more next season. I knew it would get worse and worse as time went on.”**

Rodgers’ decision to omit Gerrard from Liverpool’s starting lineup at Real Madrid in the Champions League would have been a serious setback to the man who lifted the club’s fifth European Cup in 2005. The former England captain has also come in for severe criticism during Liverpool’s difficult campaign yet has showed his enduring importance to the club several times this season, including in the FA Cup win at AFC Wimbledon on Monday.

“It’s got nothing to do with how results have been,” Gerrard said of his decision to leave. “That’s not the type I am. If things aren’t going so well, I’d rather stay and help to put things right. I think I’ve shown that over the years.

If your point was that the NHS was too pressed to provide ideal care, then that is really what you should have said, rather than the meaningless reduction in function that you actually gave. 

With the best will in the world a layperson cannot know (except in rare circumstances) if their care was substandard or rushed (and rushed is not the same as completed quickly), certainly not on the basis of an individual outcome. Sometimes what should work doesn't, and often patients and healthcare workers have different expectations. Likewise, an awareness of targets does not equate to being enslaved to them.

2) Whenever I've heard the term Chink it has always been used as a racial epithet aimed at me

3) If you think in any way shape form or manner that Chinky to refer to a Chinese restaurant isn't derived from the insult Chink then you're deluded, insane or just flat out stupid.

4) I was born here, I was bred here and I've bled for here so yeah when people for the 5 jazillionth time ask me me ""Where are you from?"" and I reply ""London"" and then they ask again ""No, where are you REALLY from?"" it starts pissing me off, as if somehow everything I've been and done until then has been invalidated because I've got a different fucking skin colour. (For added hilarity I've replied after that second question multiple answers ranging from ""Well you see, mummy and daddy did a bad thing and then nine months later..."" to ""Well, my home in Waterloo?"" or if I'm feeling particularly grumpy ""London"" in a frosty tone.) P.S. I think the safest way to ask that question if you really have to ask is ""Do you mind if I ask you what your ethnic background/family history is?

5) The [Bamboo Ceiling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboo_ceiling) and [Model Minority](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_minority) syndromes do exist here and they do happen here. There have been countless times where I've just been completely looked over for promotion or advancement.

6) I've seen and had happen to me countless times incidents of racism and had both British Chinese and White British people tell me to just shrug it off rather than kick back.

7) On the flip side where I used to work kept on trying to put me on sodding PR style bullshit and outreach shite instead of my real duties just so they could in effect say **""HEY GUYS LOOK AT US WE HAVE A BRITISH BORN CHINESE HERE SERVING WITH US! WE'RE NOT RACIST!""** instead of you know, my real job, duties, obligations, work and etc...

If you look at the British Chinese demographic breakdown and socio-economic demographics, they come in pretty amazingly, some of the highest educational attainments amongst ethnic minorities, some of the lowest adult and child poverty rates around, huge numbers of us in professional careers and almost none of us have any real power or position be it either in the public or in business. As someone else has said, the British Chinese by population make up about 0.7% of the population, more of our kids get Firsts at university, more of us work in pretty kick ass professions, just off the top of my head I can name about 30 friends who work in FTSE100 and Fortune 500 firms.

It's also the most avoided tax in the country by miles - there's something about it that really, really outrages people. People will often take decisions that negatively affect their life in order to avoid the tax. It's also a tax that you really can't stop avoidance on.

The result of this is that most people liable for inheritance tax will try (and probably succeed) at avoiding the tax if they can. The desire to avoid the tax rises as the value of the estate rises, so the richest people work the hardest to avoid the tax. This means that it disproportionately falls on people who are not particularly wealthy - someone who bought a house in Surrey 40 years ago that has now ballooned in value. People without the liquid assets to instruct lawyers and accountants, but with a relatively valuable home. 

I'm really not convinced that it has much value as a tax at all.

I think the only episodes I can't watch are Into the Dalek and Kill the Moon everything else is at least watchable.

While for me it didn't get better in the Tennant years until 4, series 3 saw improvement over 2 even if the Doctor became just slightly more unlikable and had it bite him in the end.  Series 5, however began on this note of fairy tales that turned into creating a big bang, it was already on the wrong foot.  6 didn't fare any better with a mother of an introduction but a whimper at the end and 7, while it was my first live series it hasn't been great in retrospect.  The Christmas episode seemed rushed and really the new companion was just the nanny with kids, who was awesome at everything.  Series 8 gave both her and the Doctor a massive amount of flaws almost to the point with the two it's like looking into a mirror.  They're both manipulative, when they're ""on"" they become alien, they take charge and for a weird bit they both like saying ""shut up.""

Where they take them in the future is beyond me.  However while many may complain about series 8, what I got from it are two people discovering who they are through each other.

- Unlike United, who is basically an established superpower in terms of shirt sales, an investment in such magnitude would be a gamble for Adidas.

It's not as if he doesn't make money for Adidas now, he's already plastered on top of every billboard, he'd have to bring in extra to cover the cost.

- FFP, ostensibly, is to limit clubs from losing money every year. I'm sure if Adidas were to pay a significant chunk of Messi's transfer fee, they'd probably insist on some form of discount when we re-negotiate our shirt deal. We might be saving on FFP wise (because his annual cost is lower), but we might also be bringing in less money every year.

I'm not saying you can't, I actually agree with you on your points with all 3.  The point is though, that Brendan makes selections and not us.  It appears that BR has been unhappy with Migs for a while and had Pepe back but still chose to let him go.  And our defensive issues were much the same last year when Agger was here and he still wasn't getting consistent playing time. 

The issue isn't necessarily having wages on the bench, its having wages on the bench that are never going to get off the bench to prove their worth and justify those wages.

This might be wrong, I don't gamble, but I think you are taxed on winnings. You can avoid this by paying a smaller tax on your stake, which you pay even if you lose. This is actually better for the taxman, because the total amount of stakes is usually greater than the total amount of winnings.

&gt; the vast majority of inheritance is expected and even relied upon by many

You can expect all you like, but the money isn't yours until the person dies and leaves it to you.

For one thing, if they need to go into a care home, it can burn up the value of an average house in no time.

&gt; Why should my family suffer when I die just so the state can dip into my wealth?

I think the justification is still the same, the dead person doesn't own it any more, the person who inherits it is lucky it went to them rather than someone else. The state takes a cut.  Nobody can really claim they are worse of than they might have been.

* Bony isn't a striker who uses the space behind defenders. If we don't have a striker like that, it means our most creative players have big part of their game cut off. 

He'd probably do reasonably well here, but I'd want us follow the path we were in the last season. I think we have the players for it. What we don't have is a knowledge how to use a striker that doesn't fit like a glove.

I took: 
-Brake Pads (Front + Rear)
-Leatherman Wave
-Choice Sockets / Spanners including a 27/32mm (cant remember which the XT is) to undo and tighten the rear axle bolt
-Tyre Levers (There is a combination Spanner/Lever which saves weight)
-Front and 2 rear inner tubes
-Duct tape/Cable Ties.

I recommend the Michelin Heavy Duty 21 inch front inner tube for durability, its reassuringly weighty in your hands,  I got no punctures thankfully.

It wouldn't hurt to tie spare brake cables to the originals, I had hand-guards so i did not bother with spare brake levers.

People sometimes have shit experiences and by the sounds of it you've had more than your fair share.  Noone is, or could, deny that. 

Is it really so hard to see though, that your individual experiences aren't of themselves an indictment of the whole institution?

Every time someone talks about an NHS horror story, you always get people who'll talk about how their experience has been stellar and vice versa. 

A&amp;E doesn't exist (and I'm not talking about you specifically here) to find out what your unusual problem is, or to fix all the problems you have. Its role is to make sure people aren't going to lose life or limb, to fix big and obvious problems, and for everything else they'll either refer onwards themselves or direct you  somewhere more appropriate. This is one of the reasons people get so upset with A&amp;E, and is a good example of where expectations differ.

Balotelli was never right for our system and never will be. I would say Bony although not a 'perfect' fit for our system, would be much better in it. I don't believe you need hindsight to tell you that.

&gt; Bony feeds off wing-play, I think everyone agrees with that. Swansea has used system and players that use classical wingers since they came up. It fits him. I don't remember when Liverpool played with classical wingers.

Partially agree, he does play in a system with wingers and gets goals from crosses into the box. However Swansea play a very similar type of football style to us and Bony has scored a fair number of goals being played in by midfielders (much how we play) such as Glyfi Siggurdson.

&gt; Bony isn't a striker who uses the space behind defenders. If we don't have a striker like that, it means our most creative players have big part of their game cut off.

Probably right, but neither does Balotelli and for an extra £3m I would rather take my chances on Bony playing in our system.",null,0,null,1420579138,null,0,false,0,cngjyz5,null,t3_2rju6n,null,t1_cngjyz5,null,t1_cngjqa6,null,null,null,1425023561,null,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3,null

If you've say a 2y gilt, you can deflate some of it's worth by printing money.  But the cost of re-financing in the future is higher as the market prices in that deflation (discounts it).

One of the things the DMO does, is to use short term notes, as these cost us less.  Even if we need the money for 30 years, we will use a series of short term notes, as this saves money.  People who get their *bond* back sooner, demand less coupon.  Just the same way you can get a better interest rate in your bank account if you don't touch the money for 2 years.

Borrowing money for longer term costs more due to the increased risk and illiquidity.

So whilst you can deflate some of your debt obligations, you might find that the cost of re-financing goes up.  This can end badly for you, just ask Northern Rock, as this is what they where doing, using the short duration end of LIBOR, which was cheaper than the long duration end, and selling a fix priced mortgage that lasts years.  Then when prices went up, due to the liquidity credit crunch, they found themselves fucked.

The problem was, that during the boom years, Brown didn't save any money, in fact spending increased, so when borrowing money because difficult and the economy contracted, we had to have a larger reduction than ideal.  Keynesianists, which is the way I generally lean, would have loved to spend more money, but doing so would have been reckless to say the least.

**Price of product:** £4.99 for 40ml

**Where did you purchase:** Boots

**Product claims:** ""...penetrate deep down and help clear spots whilst hydrating skin. Enriched with green tea and cucumber it soothes the skin and it is gentle enough to use every day.""

**About you:** Oily, closed comedone prone skin and hormonal acne sufferer. Daily acid (AHA/BHA) user. So far I know I'm sensitive to niacinamide, tea tree oil and coconut oil but so far nothing else!
 

**Your opinion:** I first bought this product a long time ago, and I used it as a moisturiser but found it to be way too light. It's pH and high level of salicylic acid make it a perfect BHA and the tube is the perfect size to be portable. Although it has a lot of silicones so it may not be useful to everyone, it is my HG BHA due to its price, availability and effectiveness.

&gt;You can expect all you like, but the money isn't yours until the person dies and leaves it to you.

I mean from both sides.  I expect and rely on the fact that my children will receive my possessions after I die.  My children are my blood line and only mark left on the world.  Of course I want to give them everything I have.  Wifes already receive inheritance tax free - why shouldn't children?  They are an equal, if not greater part of my life.  this is equally true for people and their siblings or carers.  If I was nursed through my life by a child why shouldn't I be able to give them everything I want to give them?

I've paid my way through life.  I already pay taxes to pay for the running of this country through income, capital gains, stamp duty, council tax and VAT.  I've paid my way.  What the fuck gives the government the right to say 'oops, he died, well, come on, hand over 40% of everything'!!

&gt;For one thing, if they need to go into a care home, it can burn up the value of an average house in no time.

That's a crazy argument.  Ok, let's have a birth tax.  40% of a persons wealth on the birth of a child.  They *might* end up being a net recipient.

&gt;I think the justification is still the same, the dead person doesn't own it any more, the person who inherits it is lucky it went to them rather than someone else.

That still doesn't justify the state stepping in and demanding a share!!!  If nobody is there to inherit it, then fine, give it to the state.  But if there is someone there, whoever they might be, the should receive 100%.  The state has zero claim over my possessions!

&gt;Nobody can really claim they are worse of than they might have been.

Carers of elderly relatives who sacrifice their life to help - fuckin *plenty* of those these days.  Widows who see the share apportioned to their children going 40% to the state against her husbands wishes.  

Doesn't the wishes of someone mean anything to you?

null,false,Titanomakhia,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,null,"First of all, it's not ""free movement"" - the EU treaties grant 4 types of free movement 3 of which have nothing to do with immigrants. As EU citizens we have free movements of goods, services, capital and WORKERS. Note the capitalisation. Free movement of people, despite being a popular way to refer to it, is incorrect. You may only move to another EU country to work or if you are provably self-sufficient (in which case you should be ineligible for most government assistance). Families may be united but at least one member must be working or self-sufficient. If you are not within these categories you may be deported and possibly banned from returning for a temporary period. (Germany is more strict and does the latter but we don't because the Home Office doesn't want the hassle, anyone want to guess why Germany is more relaxed about free movement of workers? Blame the Home Office.) Workers may also be prevented from claiming benefits until they have paid in through tax. We've only just begun thinking about doing this and it won't be in place until after the election. Again, Germany does this but we don't. Guess why they are happy and were not. 

Anyway on to workers.

The common market is all about trying to create one giant economic system across the entire continent. The benefits of that are obvious enough (more customers for firms, more products for customers, universal regulation meaning less paperwork and easy access to European countries etc etc). On a smaller scale the UK is an economy spread over 4 countries and operates in this way on the same basis - many of the arguments were had during the Scots independence debate. 

Now imagine if it was either impossible or very difficult to work in Scotland as an English person and vice versa. The paper work would be immense, work visas would need to be obtained and payments made. It would leave Scotland and England somewhat isolated from one another. If a Scottish company opens an office in England it can't move it's experienced senior managers down to run it without a massive cluster fuck which might put them off. English workers would not be able to go to Scotland to work for large Scottish companies. There are about 200,000 oil &amp; gas related jobs in Scotland - it's possible that the oil companies might find it hard to persuade 4% of the entire Scottish population to work in oil &amp; gas. The fact that that gap can be filled with English workers (and they are; there are 500,000 English working in Scotland across all sectors) means there is no labour shortage and production can go as fast as possible. Same is true of any industry. [UK seasonal farming](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/may/25/migrant-jobs-fruit-farms-kent) has been largely dependant on foreign workers for a while and the [UK construction industry](http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2013/oct/10/construction-jobs-skilled-labour) is potentially being hampered by a lack of construction workers. Labour shortages = inefficient operation and thus companies don't do as well and often pay less tax due to smaller profits as a result. In other words, while labour shortages are fine in the very short term because wages may possibly rise but as company overheads rise in line and growth opportunities are missed because there are not the people to take advantage of them it damages the company's performance and damages the economy in general. Free movement of workers increases the pool of workers thus ensuring a labour shortage is less likely allowing the economy to grow faster.

One thing to remember is that just because we have millions of unemployed doesn't mean immigration won't be good for some industries and it doesn't necessarily mean the immigrants are taking British people's jobs. The construction industry is in need of workers according to the link above so by and large construction workers are probably not the one's unemployed (though it's certainly more complicated than that). If other Europeans come and fill a labour gap in construction in London they are not taking a job from an unemployed computer scientist in Glasgow or from an unemployed insurance broker in Nottingham. In fact the increased productivity of the construction firm that required foreign workers may result in more work for suppliers who may well hire British workers who in turn may pass on the effect. This is the one thing people just cannot seem to understand - employment is not a zero sum game; it's not one in one out - at all. 1 foreign worker does not = 1 unemployed Brit. 1 foreign workers could, if conditions were right, mean 5 new jobs for British people because that worker creates demand in his job and in his own daily life. Demand = employment. 

The lack of a link between unemployment and temporary European immigration can be clearly seen when you look at the years 2004-2007 when we had huge levels of Polish immigration, much much higher than current levels, yet unemployment kept falling and growth rates stayed high showing no indication that they were affected by Polish immigration. Only after the economic crash (caused by banks not by immigrants) did people start deciding immigration meant unemployment. In 2006 you would have been laughed at. 

That's the economic justification anyway and [the UK has done very well economically via this mechanism.](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2014/07/01/the-uk-has-been-one-of-the-main-beneficiaries-from-free-movement-of-labour-in-the-eu/) 

There are other social benefits though which I won't go into much as this is already too long. The Erasmus program is one obvious social/cultural benefit of free movement of workers (though in this case they are self-sufficient). Students get the chance to study abroad and travel experiencing new countries and languages. Obviously travel and study abroad will mature you and give you a greater perspective on the world - the personal benefits are huge. [And employers absolutely love it.](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-14-1025_en.htm) Having a well educated, well travelled youth is always a good thing. 

You can retire/take a gap year or whatever in the EU with no problems provided you are self-sufficient. It makes mass pan-European projects like the ESA and Cern much much easier because the scientists never have any immigration trouble. Scientists are often the academics that require the ability to travel the most and encouraging scientists to leave the ESA or Cern or UK universities and go to America or somewhere [would be a really bad policy.](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nobel-winner-slates-britains-stupid-immigration-reforms-8433324.html) 

It's also, in part, a matter of common sense. The EU treaties allow any of us to set up a business in another EU country, move money to that country, sell goods and services in those countries, buy houses and any number of other things. The idea that it could still be a nightmare if not actually impossible for me to live in the country in which I own and run my company and can buy or sell anything in is a little absurd. Free movement of workers is often a necessary part of enjoying the other freedoms granted by the treaties. The treaties require some cross-border element before they may be enforced so occasionally your right to enjoy a certain freedom or benefit of the EU will require that you actually be in another EU country before you use it. Again not being able to work/move to another EU country would be a bit silly in that scenario as it would effectively invalidate some freedoms of the treaty.

I'm putting a lot of the blame for this one on Sam. For starters, he should know by now that Valencia is completely ineffective as a lone striker. He absolutely needs a partner.

Third: parking the bus with only a one goal advantage against a club that has our number is a bad decision. Keeping the pressure up was what we should have done.

Noble looked great in his return. Downing and Collins both looked excellent. Joey O'Brien can fuck off to some deserted island with Kevin Nolan. Fuck I'm pissed.

We haven't won in our last 4 games. 2 draws and 2 losses. Now we've got a rough slate without Kouyate, Song or Sakho. If our form doesn't improve (and soon) we can kiss our European dreams goodbye.

balotelli, however, a player who has played in the prem for a couple of years at a younger age had played some really good footy for city. he wasn't sensational, but he was about as prolific as bony was and balotelli wasn't even starting. now that in itself is kinda ironic because i think that was systematic as well, but on a sheet of paper, they're about the same. but when comparing the two, they both have a good, strong shot, they're both pretty big guys, they both are young (although balotelli is younger), balotelli is probably a bit quicker and from what i've seen of him, has been more of a natural playmaker than a pure striker. 

at the end of the day, this was not only a 3m difference, bony was going to demand much higher wages (balo took a huge pay cut to come here) and balo is by far the player with the higher ceiling. his talent is undeniable, and he still has potential to be a 20 goal/season striker.

The NHS treatment I've received is fairly minor and I'd expect I have less experience with it from you by the sound of it, I won't go into any specifics of what I've had but I tend to regularly visit an outpatients facility for Neurology, Eczema, Asthma and ENT. One of the issues I have has required surgery in the past and it looks like it may require it again at a later date in my life.

In terms of how I've been treated it's been great, the doctors/nurses as a whole(apart from my old GP back in Wales and my current Eczema doctor) have been very professional and they've worked well and professionally to sort out any issues I have. I noticed with my operation that afterwards the nurses felt particularly stretched to deal with what I needed(seemed a bit short staffed) but the actual nurses were great.

With private health care, I certainly wouldn't be able to afford to pay for the insurance, I've been recommended it in the past by multiple people due to how slow it can be to get some things done through the NHS and I've been told that you get the same quality of doctors/nurses but with more personalised treatment and more resources to look after you. 

While I may state in an ideal world, I'd prefer the NHS to be mostly privatised but that doesn't mean that I want everybody to pay for health insurance, I'd personally prefer a voucher based system which could be spent with any healthcare provider to prevent just one provider getting rather strained, in the current state of things, I don't think that's particularly possible.

&gt;Another commonly cited barrier, complementary to the bamboo ceiling, is the ""sticky floor."" When applied to the Asian American experience, the sticky floor refers to the phenomenon by which young professionals of Asian descent are often trapped in low-level, low-mobility jobs. Asian Americans graduate from universities in high numbers, and firms tend to hire them in high numbers as well. However, within a few years, many claim to find themselves pigeonholed into dead-end careers with no path for advancement to upper-level corporate careers. This process is visible across a number of fields, including business, academia, and law. Even in areas where Asian Americans are believed to excel, such as software engineering, there is an overall tendency to see them assigned to low-ranking positions with fewer opportunities for advancement compared to other racial groups.

&gt;The BC Project (integration of British Chinese into politics) carries a British Chinese Online Identities paper on its website. The paper states that there has been a lack of cultural visibility highlighted in the early years of the 21st century and brought to light a survey conducted by the Guardian in early 2005 which revealed the low level of integration among Chinese people in Britain, who reportedly felt the least British among all ethnic minority groups. The Chinese British society seems disengaged with UK society and electoral commission figures suggest around 30% of registered Chinese voters never vote.

THIRTY PERCENT!!!!

From my work politics plays a huge role ok? International relations is what I live and breathe yet to see over 30% of the British Chinese disenfranchised because they feel completely disconnected from the social norms.

I thought the team looked good during most of that first half.  The ball was moving quite nicely up the field and had a couple of opportunities.  I was a little worried about the defense as they seeemed to be okay but not much more than that.  Distin looked pretty good, with the exception of almost getting beat during a breakaway, and that may be the first time I'm not yelling into my computer screen to get him off of the pitch.

Second half, the guys started to look like they were having a ""Hull City"" moment.  They didn't seem to have the same pep in their collective steps, and the one goal was the shaky defense being...shaky.  I questioned both Mirallas and Besic being subbed in as I thought those two, along with Oviedo and Naismith, were playing quite well.  Lukaku was doing pretty well, but I think he was neutered for a bit from those calls against him.  I'm glad the goal came from inside of the penalty area as I noticed the guys attempting shots from outside of the box which I've always thought is a bit crap.

Lukaku, even though the ref seemed to be against him, great goal.  As I already mentioned, Mirallas, Besic, Oviedo, and Naismith I thought did very well, but to be more specific, I thought all four showed great effort, played physical when needed, had some decent passes, and created opportunities.  Jags and Barkley...I love you two guys; great players and leaders on this club, but good grief both off of their respective games tonight.  I would like to think their performances was a one-off thing and will be back in top form against Man. City.

To conclude my ramblings, I thought the first half effort was great, the second half effort was crap, pre-goal, and I would like to think this can have some momentum for Man. City.  Unless Man.

We saw some of **a** battle. The final battle. This would be like looking at a 30 second clip of the battle for Berlin in 1945 and saying what makes this a *World* War?  

The war had been going on for a long meta-time and across vast swathes of the universe meta-before this, both in cold form (the Doctor being sent to disrupt the genesis of the Daleks etc) and hot, when the major shooting was going on (see the novel *Engines of War*, which also mentions that the Daleks had attempted to alter Gallifrey's past, and had been stopped, amongst other things).  

By the time that we see this battle, the Daleks had pretty much won (although I don't think it could have been nearly as straight-forwards as it appears) and the Time Lock seems to already be in place in one form or another - and it is possibly this that means that TARDISes weren't being used under normal circumstances. Or perhaps, by the time Daleks had got through the transduction barriers and the sky trenches, they had got some kind of damping/jamming field in operation that prevented TARDISes working properly, leaving only the WarDoctor's heavily modified TARDIS in operation.   

However, out-of-universe, there is a huge problem with trying to visually represent a war involving time travel, without having to do a HUGE amount of exposition. We've heard the Doctor describe all kinds of horrors that occurred in the war: the nighmare child, the could-have-been king, the army of meanwhiles and never-weres, the Skaro degradations etc etc but you know very well that when you put them on the screen, they are never going to be as effective as if you keep them as hints in the background.  

Of course the war is going to boil down to conventional looking battles when we see it on screen, otherwise we probably wouldn't even recognise it *as* a war.",null,0,null,1420584792,null,0,false,0,cngnhex,null,t3_2rk7hu,null,t1_cngnhex,null,t3_2rk7hu,null,null,null,1425021852,null,10,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,10,null

Remember that we saw the *last* battle of the War.

I will always be a little bit disappointed that they showed the Time War, because it works so much better when it's something off-screen, mentioned and described but never seen.  Recall what Ten said to the Master in End of Time:

&gt;""You weren't there, in the final days of the war. You never saw what was born. But if the time lock's broken then everything's coming through and not just the Daleks but the Skaro Degradations. The horde of travesties! The Nightmare Child, The Could-Have-Been King with his army of Meanwhiles and Never-Weres... the war turned into HELL! And that's what you've opened: right above the Earth! HELL is descending!"" 

That is some evocative stuff right there.  How do you show a war when time itself is used as a weapon?  Say you've got a time machine.  You hop back in time, wipe out your enemy, maybe one gets away, nothing to worry about.  Except that they're also capable of time travel, so that survivor runs off, hops in their time machine, and goes to undo that battle.  You go to undo *that,* and you're in a war of attrition, every loop adds another layer of difficulty, another double that you have to keep in mind.  Because if any of your past selves are killed?  Best case scenario, your present self is wiped away from existence.  Worst-case, a paradox destroys the entire battlefield, and leaves an open wound in the fabric of time.

And I guarantee that what bleeds through isn't pretty.

But anyway--Time Wars.  We got to see a little bit more of it in the novel *Engines of War,* and we do get some more time-bendy things. (Namely, the concept of wiping things out of existence is brought up and features as a plot point).  Prose is, I feel, a better medium for a temporal conflict like that.  Just look at the Eighth Doctor Adventures or Faction Paradox, where one of the big arcs is about the War in Heaven, a war between the Time Lords and the unknown 'Enemy.'

After eight years of hyping up the Time War, anything that was displayed was going to be a disappointment.  I've managed to (more or less) come to terms with it by recalling that, again, this was the very end of the War.  The Time Lords have used every weapon in their arsenal except for the Moment.  Any attempts at undoing or re-doing or side-doing an event has been for naught.  All of the paradoxes and time loops and chains of causality, every tug at the Web of Time, every roar of one of the Reapers, has fallen away to pure conflict.  The universe had reduced to tatters, and both sides are desperate.  The Daleks are trying to shoot lasers and fire bombs at a planet that sits at the nexus of all of reality, trying to conventionally invade a species comparable to Gods.  They should have been wiped out on the spot--but the Time Lords have been fighting for long enough, have been beaten and bruised, and are empty-handed that it's working.

There is a bit of the 'big fish in a small pond' element as Gerrard never really had a world class squad around him, so in some ways perhaps looked a stronger player in that way, but at the same time he was still a very, very good footballer as I think near everyone (except Ferguson) would acknowledge.  If you could go back in time and say the Chelsea transfer goes through, then I do wonder sometimes what his career might have been like after that by comparison.  Obviously he wouldn't have been the legend at Liverpool that he will be, but would he still have been considered a great player or would he have fizzled out a la Torres and many others have been wont to do?    

I will say that as a bit of an older sort, I've been through the legend thing leaving a bit more than maybe some and while it's not easy for anyone, I'm honestly excited to see what a post-Gerrard Liverpool looks like.  He's obviously very influential within the club and sometimes there is good that comes from losing that as others will have the opportunity to step up.  I guess I look at it like the class of 2005-2013 or so are all pretty well gone now (Kuyt, Carra, Reina, Gerrard, Agger, etc.) and it'll be really interesting to see what happens in the summer as we move forward with a bit of a new class, if you will.

Dzeko has had the similar goal per minute record (~135 minutes per goal), for Wolfsburg, City and Bosnia. 

As far as this season goes, he's been struggling with injuries, he's had 9 starts and 4 goals. One of those starts resulted in him being subbed out immediately due to the injury.

FoM also includes settling, this helps handle labour shortages and brings investment.

Moving on from that, there are more men in prison, and as a result the prison system has been setup with men in mind. I agree that everyone should be seen as equal citizens and therefore treated equally, however if there are differences in the prison system between sexes then that is not equal. If you are aware that a woman would receive worst treatment in prison, then is it fair for her to receive the same sentence as a man? That is one of many questions that needs to be asked.

The best solution would to be to make the prison system able to support both men and women equally, but that is not an easy thing to do, it would take time. The Green's policy is for the short term, and it would be extended to both men and women in the long term I believe, it's just as it stands the Green Party believe that women are not as well supported in prison as men, and therefore to avoid the scenario of imprisonment is the best case.

In my opinion rehabilitation should always be the first option, and this is a positive step towards that, but I also see why there are qualms with the policy, and why it is controversial.

I did a bit of research and the first thing you need to do is to register your brother as a disabled supporter.  Per CFC site, ""Disabled supporter tickets are only available to registered disabled members of Chelsea.""  &lt;-- You can do that by submitting your (in this case your brother) full name and address to disability@chelseafc.com or call the disability direct line 020 7915 1950 to request an application form (which is also online if you want to fill it out with the email).

The tickets are then issued 42 days prior to match day - so I would try to get this done ASAP and also register yourself as a CFC member as you will more than likely have to get permission to be in the same seating area as him.

Lastly - I try to go to one or two Chelsea games a year (from Atlanta) and was in a rental car the first time around, which was a disaster.  I'm not sure what your travel plans are but I would definitely inquire about parking as well.

Good Luck!

Salisbury is like a rundown version of Winchester but in terms of attractions more interesting. The Cathedral is the very best in the country and the city is also only a few miles from Stonehenge.

To some people, Courtois is clearly the better choice since he (recently) has made more impressive saves, but all of the other intangible things are just as important. The best goalkeeper is the one that gives his team the best chance to win. That sounds obvious, but I feel like people forget that things like communicating with your back line and organizing the defense on set pieces can prevent saves from ever happening.

Even if Parliament doesn't vote to go to war, he retains the Royal Prerogatives, which are essentially old constitutional powers which are directly bestowed onto the PM by the monarch herself, and which would allow him to declare war without need for Parliamentarian consent.

HOWEVER, the laws he might have breached are in fact international laws, primarily the Rome Statute of the ICC http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome_Statute_of_the_International_Criminal_Court, an international treaty which was created in response to states committing mass atrocities with no suitable international penalty (primarily the Serbian-Bosnian conflict). War crimes are not necessarily new, multiple bodies in the past have tried individuals in governments for war crimes (e.g. Nazis, Japanese war criminals in WWII, and Serbian officials in Milosevich's government). None have been as comprehensive and far reaching as the ICC treaty however. 

 Usually, countries have immunity when it comes to whether individuals within the governments themselves are prosecuted. If a government behaved badly, the UN Treaties tended to punish the country and allow for economic sanctions against this particular country, and in very specific circumstances, even military responses. However, the ICC goes one step further, and actually lifts this 'veil' of immunity, allowing individuals within governments to be prosecuted for what are considered 'war crimes' that is things like torture, wars of aggression, and genocide. 

Genocide is easy to identify, and so is much easier to prosecute without eliciting too much outcry from nations who are signed on to the treaty, hence why no one really complains about obviously genocidal people like Milosevich being prosecuted. Wars of aggression though are way more contentious and controversial considering the fact that whilst not every country engages in genocide, most of them use war in very morally flexible ways. Even worse is the fact that most international legal courts require the support of powerful superpowers to maintain credibility and to ensure that the element of consent (remember, parties actually have to sign up to these treaties to be bound to them!) continues. Most countries will begrudgingly sign up for the sake of face, but if the ICC pushes too hard, especially on powerful Western nations, they will withdraw, and the only people you have left are a few 3rd world countries who no one has ever heard of. The court loses power, and becomes worthless. This is the problem confronting the ICC with Blair and Bush. it is possible they have committed the war crime of aggression, meaning they could be taken to the ICC to stand trial for war crimes, BUT, politics as well as the difficult legal conception of whether the Iraq War was in fact a 'war of aggression' or a legitimate response to a dictator means it is by no means clear cut. It hasn't helped that America has continued to pass legislation making its officials 'immune' to extradition by international bodies, effectively neutering the consent necessary to even grant the ICC power in the matter. The truth of the matter is, the Iraq war in political terms is often seen as black and white as 'it was evil, it was a war crime, quickly law, punish the mean nasty people', whereas international law is a mixture of politics, economics, law and negotiation. I think they might eventually get some CIA officials extradited for war crimes with torture, because the evidence there is pretty strong, but highly unlikely they'll get Blair and Bush on war crimes of aggression.

Sakho, and now Can, are really the only CBs that will take the ball and look to advance it. They make positive passes the help spark attacks or get the opponent on the back foot.

null,false,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,null,"&gt; http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=457 workers/labour is still the used wording. 

But look at the bullet points. These are all specific to actual employed workers, not for example the family of an employed worker. 

What you linked says that ""Free movement of workers is a fundamental principle"" and I agree with that. It makes no mention to what you would call ""unemployed workers"" and what I would call people. 

What you have linked is in reference to workers as defined by the Treaty of Rome, which I have discussed below. 

&gt;The treaty of paris is not a founding text of the EU but the the treaty of Rome is, and is incorporated into modern EU law via the Maastricht and Lisbon treaty. FoM is a founding principle.

Ok so read the wording of the Treaty of Rome, article 48:

&gt;WORKERS

&gt;ARTICLE 48

&gt;1. Freedom of movement for workers shall be secured within the Community by the
end of the transitional period at the latest.

&gt;2. Such freedom of movement shall entail the abolition of any discrimination based
on nationality between workers of the Member States as regards employment,
remuneration and other conditions of work and employment.

&gt;3. It shall entail the right, subject to limitations justified on grounds of public policy,
public security or public health:

&gt;(a) to accept offers of employment actually made;

&gt;(b) to move freely within the territory of Member States for this purpose;

&gt;(c) to stay in a Member State for the purpose of employment in accordance with the
provisions governing the employment of nationals of that State laid down by law,
regulation or administrative action;

&gt;(d) to remain in the territory of a Member State after having been employed in that
State, subject to conditions which shall be embodied in implementing regulations
to be drawn up by the Commission.

&gt;4. The provisions of this Article shall not apply to employment in the public service. 

Worker is clearly defined here as someone who is employed or self employed. It is not a substitute for person, as you have suggested. As far as I can tell, worker has never been synonymous with person. The rules were later changed so that the family members of a worker are now able to move with that worker, but the worker requirement still exists. 

&gt;As for your last point you'd have to specify what you mean by these two distinctions? 

Hopefully this distinction is clear now. Allowing the free movement of workers can bring benefits, although I would argue those benefits could be increased by being selective in which workers we take in. What is the benefit of allowing the families of workers to move here as well?

Berahino has to be the most overrated player ive seen in the past few years. He has scored and handful of goals this season and has an attitude issue. **What was the point of investing money in Paul Mitchell if we are just going to sign big names for inflated prices? We want to scout cheaper players off the radar to save money and possibly sell on for more. Look at what he did at southamptom**

Also, buying players guarantees nothing. This is an issue with english football compared to german football for example. There are some situations where GOOD COACHING is needed to improve a player not just buying a player. I'd rather see what we can do with the players we have first who have a good attitude. 

Also we historically do nothing to very little in january, so dont get your hopes up. We wont buy anything at all unless we offload, let alone a 20+ million striker. This isnt fifa. Rather see what Onomah is made of before we even consider Berahino.

Did i ever say run harry into the dirt? We have bobby as backup. He is good as backup. No. Also you just said we should ""Splash"" on these players. Do you know what club you support? When have we ever splashed without a massive out in the same window?

Berahino scored about 5 in the league last season and has eight in the league this season... 

That makes him worth 20 mill? 20 games? i dont get it. I would understand a few solid seasons but 8 goals in 20 league games? how? What if we spend 20 mil and hes shit. Thats high risk. Levy doesnt like risk. 

There is a difference between good coaching and spending 20+ on players in January. Again, what was the point of bringing paul mitchell in if we just buy the big names. it makes no sense. Did southampton buy the big names? No. They bought the right names for the right price. Levy wants to model this.  Also, we are doing pretty decent this season. Why would levy think we need to spend all that money right now? 

Also, giving up on Townsend and carrol? Why? They are our own. Come on... Carrol is doing well. and some time ago Andros was the hottest winger in the PL.

I get that its exciting and it would be fantastic to get them, but it just doesnt fit into what we are trying to do mate. We rarely buy high. because then we lose money.

No. Because when most people talk about CCTV they're talking about all cameras, which it turns out are vastly operated in private with no communication with the government at all.

&gt; Do they know with advancing technology, and algorithms, it starts to predict behaviour?”

Only on a very small scale.

As previously mentioned, the majority of cameras are privately owned and the footage is not publicly available. 

This isn't the movies where some government spook can easily follow someone or set up a computer program to track an individual. That kind of thing requires specialised and incredibly expensive equipment that very few people actually own (mainly casinos). And those that do own it are not exactly the type of people to share their live access with the government without a warrant.

""Big Brother watching you"" nowadays doesn't mean it's visually following you. The police would be far more likely to simply track your phone.

&gt; “If people are going round with surveillance equipment attached to them, there should be a genuinely good and compelling reason for that.

The ""compelling reason"" is the safety of their staff. From police officers to checkout workers, almost everyone has at one time seen a member of the public kick off and get violent at some point. What better way to protect your staff than security cameras?

There is literally no way you can judge lacazette has bigger potential. Jozy Altidore had scored 31 goals for AZ in the Eredivisie plus Cup, a league similar to Ligue 1. I am sure a lot of people thought he had great potential as well.

AFCON happens every two years, not every year, so Bony wouldnt leave every January.

And you could similarly say Lacazette is also Lyon great, not City great.

We also are very good at signing ""DPs"" who no one has heard of and no one can understand why they are making what we are paying them, and then after 6 months we get rid of them.  Among some supporters there is some discussion about if the owner using these transfers like a money laundering / kickback scheme of MLS allocation money.   

Basically, if you suck (like we have since our new owner took over) MLS gives you allocation money each year, which is like free money to sign more/better players.  But, the owner can't just POCKET this money, it has to be spent on players.  So he says ""Hey El Nacional, we'll pay you a giant transfer fee for this player you have who isn't really worth it.  And then you pay me back 1/2 the transfer fee under the table"", then after 6 months with this player we loan him out or sell him for nothing or whatever.  It sure happens a lot.

It would be shortsighted to get someone specifically for this situation. Getting bony will help in the future when there may be a greater need for a true striker. He'll also likely be competing directly with dzeko, who really needs some kind of push to find his form.

null,false,intense_beige,null,null,null,"Capaldi was great (though I'll cop to taking a few episodes to start accepting him as Twelve), Clara was mostly okay and occasionally great herself (Flatline); if she and Twelve are taken in isolation, without her stupid sideplot with Danny, I don't really think she was written any worse this season than last. The conflict between the two of them really juxtaposed nicely with their vaguely flirty relationship previously, and underscored the fact that Twelve is just kind of a dick, sometimes.

Danny was sort of a dumb character, though? Like, I didn't hate him, and the episode most involving him (The Caretaker) had him being pretty likable, save for his stupid backflip. But the correct response to ""your girlfriend has an alien space dad who can travel anywhere in time and space"" is not ""stop travelling with him because I have emotional baggage because I shot a kid, whoopsie kittens"".

On that note, while I am glad he's dead (that sounds pretty harsh, oops), having a get-out-of-death free card and using it on a totally uncharacterized random kid was really unsatisfying, especially since Danny had **already saved the world**. I feel like that earns you one trip back from the Nethersphere.

Missy was amazing, hillarious, and still pretty scary, looking forward to Series 9 pretty much exclusively because of her return and Capaldi's.

All in all one of the better seasons (on par with 3 &amp; 4, I gave it a ""loved it"" because there were some truly great episodes), but some more misc. complaints:

* Fuck me sideways with a rake if one more season finale ends with the world being saved by the power of love, I'm going to try to kill Moffat with my brain.
* This series had a weird tendency to pull its punches and wuss out at the last moment - timeskipping through the Doctor saving everyone on the Orient Express after it appears to explode (not that I honestly thought Twelve or Clara would die permanently then, obviously), Danny having a way back from the grave and then not doing so, Clara dying of old age but it actually being a dream. I realize these all had separate explanations (time constraints, Samuel Anderson leaving the show, and Jenna Coleman *not* leaving the show, respectively), but it's an odd trend.
* Clara's waffling between Danny and Twelve, while not explicitly a romantic conflict, harkens back to the early-Series 5 Amy-Rory-Eleven dynamic, which was boring then and stupid now. If you want to make companions choose between the TARDIS and normal life, Donna and Martha's situations seem like a pretty good example, involving their families and friends, not just their current romantic interest; it seems more like a genuine choice between two truly different lives, rather than a shallower pick between two guys. Or, alternatively, throw this particular facet of the show away, it's been super overplayed.

To end on a good note, here's a few things I really liked:

* Capaldi has been absolutely amazing, and has completely sold me on the concept of an older, less approachable Doctor, speaking as someone who joined the fandom around Series 5.
* While she may have overstayed her welcome by Series 9, Clara is fundamentally a good companion that challenges the Doctor at appropriate times; seeing a companion become increasingly self-reliant and competent without the Doctor (as in Flatline, as well as Turn Left, the Last of the Time Lords, and The Girl Who Waited, sort of) is always a nice moment of character development.
* Even when the plot wasn't great, the dialogue made up for it (""Thank you, Prince of Thieves. Last of the Time Lords?"").",null,0,null,1420610722,null,0,false,0,cnh141k,null,t3_2rjl0e,null,t1_cnh141k,null,t3_2rjl0e,null,null,null,1425015354,null,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4,null

Clearly when Matic and Fabregas play there's no problem, Ramires can put in a great shift too and he's a flexible player who can cover multiple roles so he's a good player to have but I feel that the team is lacking a back up creative element in the midfield position. They don't have to be an incredible playmaker like Fabregas has been, I think the team just needs a box-to-box midfielder who can do a decent job at both ends of the pitch fairly efficiently. Basically someone like Khedira or Pogba who have supposedly been on-off targets for a while but obviously it doesn't have to be either of those, just someone else who can successfully transition the ball from defence into attack if Fabregas isn't available and preferably who is a little more defensively competent than he is.

The more popular positions are on the right wing and at CB though but I'm less worried there.

Messi isn't from Barca but he was taken there when he was 11(?) and the club brought him up.

Him having a say or not on who has the number is really the least of what I was saying; maybe you're right and he would hate that.  I think that as more and more comes out about Liverpool not offering him a contract when he was blowing it (chelsea/WC) the club are looking worse and worse.  We offered Sterling an embarrassing contract a month ago that he rightly turned down.  

Gerrard is synonymous with Liverpool the same way the other players I mentioned are.

heathrow express from heathrow -&gt; paddington station. (its more expensive but faster and more comfortable than the tube which i figure will be easier for you). booked in advance this costs £15 each, on the day its ~£20. 

Then get an uber (phone app taxi) from paddington to liverpool street for the person that cant walk and a few others. go to the pub and sit there and wait for the rest to get the circle line around the city and meet up. the uber shouldnt cost much, maybe £30 at most ?

You could get the tube instead getting the picadilly line to say kings cross, that costs £5.70 each for a single ticket, taxi from there will be cheaper than from paddington.

then get the train from there to colchester. on the day tickets are £28.30 , booked in advance will cost you much less. use http://www.abelliogreateranglia.co.uk/ (it shows me prices of £9/each) and you can collect the tickets 2hrs after booking at the station.

total costs should be for all that should be £400 for the lot of you, which isnt much less than the taxi.

Sterling's obvious skill and future potential is very seductive but I don't ever want to hear stories 5 years down the line about how we burned out this talent and hear stories about what could have been.

Unfortunately, the loss of Suarez and the lengthy injury to Sturridge and the collective slow start to the season has certainly put us in the awkward position where we have to play Sterling more often than we would like. So it goes.

I personally think this is something to keep in mind regarding transfers. We obviously want to add quality to the squad for the obvious reasons but we also have to remember that we also need to add this quality because we need to protect youngsters like Sterling.

Frankly, this belief is what makes great players *great*. Unfortunately, this is why we often see sad endings to the careers of legends.

Life is all about knowing when to get in and when to get out. And that idea rings even louder and more true in the world of business especially in sports.

Yes, the sentimental side of me wishes that everything had worked out perfectly and I wish Gerrard could retire in a Liverpool shirt. However, I think the way it played out was probably the second best way for all parties involved:

* Ownership and management are not forced into the awkward situation of being forced to play an aging legend or unceremoniously demote a legend to the bench.
* Steven Gerrard, who clearly believes he still has more to give, is able to gracefully leave Gerrard with memories of a strong and fit Gerrard while still being able to compete in another league.

I understand that the feeling of sentiment and nostalgia are strong at the moment but, for me, those feelings do not last very long.

The NHS has a weird system of covering absences, any gaps in scheduling are just punted out to agencies that charge a fee, the agencies all charge different rates and pay doctors different amounts, so generally the doctors will swing towards the higher paying firms. This basically turns the agencies into lobbying groups for higher paid locum shifts. It's a major failing that the NHS doesn't run its own agency.

Anyways, European doctors(a lot are eastern european) will fly over to the UK once a month and work locum shifts for a week or 2.

Try thinking for yourself for once, and consider that the basic problem here is the fact that money is required to run a campaign in the first place, ie, that you need adverts on TV, merchandise, party politicals disguised as music shows. If people stopped looking at elections as a popularity contest, and just hunkered down, read about the policies proposed by each party and decided on that basis, there would be no need to do anything about money - simply because it would not be a factor.

Of course, I also understand that our ability to attract and sign established, veteran players is also limited with our lack of consistent Champions League player, etc.

But to the argument that we shouldn't sign Shaqiri simply because we don't know where he could play? Well, I think that is a poor argument.

If Rodgers, the staff, ownership, etc. think that Shaqiri is a player worth pursuing then why not?

If he is good enough and proves his quality in training, then we will certainly find a spot for him at the cost of another player. Simple as that.

* Oh, we have Coutinho? Sure. But Coutinho has exhibited the maturity and skill to move around as necessary without complaint (a manager's dream, I'd imagine).
* Oh, we have Raheem Sterling? Sure. But we can't play him every match and burn him out. Furthermore, Sterling also exhibits the maturity and skill to shift positions if necessary.
* Oh, we have Lallana? Sure. I love Lallana and I think he is one of my favorite signings and I think he'll come good... but we also have to accept that Lallana isn't exactly the most durable player.
* Oh, we have Markovic? I also like Markovic a lot but he is still very young and will need a bit of time before he can be consistently counted on week in and week out. And perhaps a little competition from Shaqiri can help.

I subscribe to the philosophy that The Tomkins Times presented a while ago: If 50% of your transfers ""succeed"" (i.e. are regularly in the first team or better) then that is a very successful transfer window. But, obviously, having 50% of your incoming transfers succeed is incredibly difficult.

The long story short - in an admittedly very simplified way - is that in *every* transfer window, a club should continually add and subtract. We may not be the richest club but we're not poor either.

---

&gt;

&gt;The British Army maintained its requirement for a four-man crew (including a loader) after risk analysis of the incorporation of an [automatic loader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoloader) suggested that auto-loaders reduced battlefield survivability. Mechanical failure and the time required for repair were prime concerns.

&gt;Similar to every British tank since the [Centurion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centurion_tank), and most other British AFVs, Challenger 2 contains a [boiling vessel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_vessel) (BV) for water which can be used to brew tea, produce other hot beverages and heat boil-in-the-bag meals contained in [field ration packs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_ration#United_Kingdom).  This BV requirement is general for armoured vehicles of the British Armed Forces, and is unique to the armed forces of the UK.

&gt;The key conversation or moment was with the manager when he sat me down not so long ago and said it was time to manage my games for me and for the team.

&gt; **I'm bright enough to realise it is the right thing for everyone, but when you've been a starter and a mainstay in the team for such a long time, it was a very difficult conversation to have**

Gerrard was unwilling to sign a contract that saw him in a reduced playing role (which is what he deserves) - so, no, he wouldn't have signed a new contract. I'm sure he would've signed an extension of his old contract, where he's a guaranteed starter - which is surely what he means when he's quoted as saying ""I would've stayed if I got a contract offer in the summer"" - but that's not what was on offer or what he is deserving of. 

Gerrard could've easily stayed on at the club in a rotational role, which is what he knows is the best thing for the team (from the quote above), but his ego doesn't allow for that. He wants to be the main man. That's fine, but it means he is the one responsible for his leaving  the club.

* **Remy** - that whole saga was very strange. Almost signed and then not signed? Mysterious medical? Clearly something serious happened there, what with his transfer being a very openly publicised secret that was cancelled at the last minute. Whether it was truly his medical or drugs or whether it was because the Borini deal fell through, I don't know. But it's clear that the intent to sign him was there, only for something significant to stop it from happening 

* **Bony** - I'm going to say we all suffer a bit from the 'Captain Hindsight' syndrome here. Remember, before this season, Bony had one good season in the Erdedivisie and one decent season in the Premiership. Other players with good seasons were Lovren, Lallana and Lambert. Lallana has been good recently, but he's still not justifying his fee. I hope and believe he will and so may Lovren. But who is to say the same problem wouldn't happen with Bony? After all, he stayed in the same team, playing the same system. Who knows what would happen at Liverpool? Would he adapt enough to score 15 goals this season and make a difference? Secondly, the £16-20m fee is speculation. I also remember people saying £25m, which would have seemed a ridiculous amount of money at the time (and, in my opinion, it still is for a 15-goals/season striker) 

* **Borini** - I think him staying put the spanner in the works for a few transfers. £16m for Balotelli plus £14m for Borini would have given us £30m for a striker - not a bad amount to have lying around. Furthermore, no one was going to predict Sturridge being out for this long and that Lambert/Borini would prove so... inefficient. With three strikers, signing Balotelli made sense. It simply unfortunate that Sturridge got injured and that attempting to play Balotelli as a like-for-like substitute for Sturridge was interpreted as being our best plan at the time 

* **'Star player'** - this is more of a personal note. I remember plenty of people here and elsewhere desiring a 'star player'. Someone whose signature would signal intent (and boost our commercial appeal). Perhaps that is what Borini would have funded. Are Bony and Remy star players? No. In the end, things didn't work out and the best we could sign was Balotelli who, thus far, has received a mixed response (to put it kindly). In other words - I think a bit of commercial and marketing speculation may have played a part in us waiting for a 'name' to become available as opposed to signing relatively unknown/unproven (in the global sense) players

A bit of background:  I know I'm not a good rider.  Know it beyond a shadow of a doubt.  I'm in training to be an advanced tutor and every time I ride I do something wrong (or occasionally potentially dangerous) that I'd pick up a trainee on (ignoring speeding for a moment).  At well over 100k in and holder of both IAM and RoSPA certificates, I'm finally in a position where I have the ability to critically assess my riding.  It comes from some experience, a lot of training and a lot of observing other (better) riders.

My issue is, I see some horrendous riding and driving from a lot of people who lack the ability to assess whether they're riding well or not.  The statistics for youngsters are horrendous because the CBT simply doesn't prepare you for riding safely.  Practice does not make perfect, it makes permanent.  So you have a combination of insufficient training and reinforcement of bad habits.  That adds up to lots of young riders getting hurt or killed.  You simply cannot learn the rules of the road in a day.  Where to be, where to look, what's my next hazard.  In a car you have a safety margin, on a bike you don't.

It was a tiny, tiny fraction of a percent who were responsible, most of them, sales people types.  I don't generally think of sales people as having traits that make for good, erm people, the best ones always strike me as somewhat sociopathic.

The rest was an honest kind of incompetence, the kind that failed to think through.  To me it all boils down to people not capturing Correlated Risk, and there is a good reason for that, it's hard (NP hard!).

Now I'm glad you said people using schemes, but in reality, I can't blame them.  I was once taxed at 68%+ on a months work.  I can't be bothered to get out of bed for that little money back in my pocket, to me, the laffer curve is about 50%, unless I feel like I'm getting more return.  But I don't.  People drive more and more for means tested benefits, many things the government offers are of no use to 'me'.  I'd probably kill myself before I ever needed dole money, because I'd be so depressed that I was being unproductive.  But then I'm, shall we say, driven.  We've got this situation when I definitely felt, back in 2010 and I was earning good money, that I was not welcome for it.  Taxed punitively, despite my biggest outgoing being my flat, which someone could have bought the exact one, two decades before, happily on a lowest band income.  All the benefits and such of a big state fail to really work for me, I'm excluded from many by means testing, and the NHS has actually performed so badly compared to private in my experience on the whole.  But then I'm being told I've got to pay for all these things I'm not using.

As a result, I see people using these schemes as a lack of engagement, people feel disenfranchised by the state's services, and a direct result of laffer curve effect.  Sure there will always be some, some who feel that 20% tax is too high, but many people I'm sure who deride these tax dodgers, would do the same in their place.  I can tell you I didn't, I nearly did, I just decided fuck working 80+ hour weeks in a hedge fund and now don't earn a quarter of what I did before, as I set up a new company, which thanks to entrepreneurs relief, I'll legally pay only a reasonably small amount of tax on.",null,0,null,1420625838,null,0,false,0,cnh543y,null,t3_2riatl,null,t1_cnh543y,null,t1_cngpbv1,null,null,null,1425013485,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Actually it was quite common under David Moyes for us to play terribly until January - we had a reputation for our slow starts.  I'm not suggesting that this is what has happened here, but it's just to say that this isn't that unusual for us ;-)

Secondly I'll point to the thing that is concerning to me a least.  Roberto Martinez has a bit of a reputation for now being able to put together a defence.   In the season before joining Everton he took Wigan to the FA Cup final (and won it!) but Wigan also got relegated from the premier league.   Teams play differently in cup competitions because it's often an ""all or nothing"" situation.   The premier league is a much more disciplined environment, and Martinez's style only really works when the attack is firing on all cylinders.  When things aren't going so well (injury, poor form, etc..) we're very fragile.  

I hope that Roberto is learning still.  I really hope that, because I like the guy and I like the way we play when we play well.  ",null,0,null,1420627008,null,0,false,0,cnh5c5n,null,t3_2rk8j1,null,t1_cnh5c5n,null,t3_2rk8j1,null,null,null,1425013381,null,3,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,3,null

Allen, Henderson, Carroll, Borini, Lovren, Lallana were all signed this way and only Henderson I'd rate as a success (and we all know he did not have too many fans initially). 

Bony may have looked brilliant last season and may have seemed a good fit - but so did the others mentioned above. Lovren last season seemed like a calm, commanding and reliable presence at the back. And look at him in a Liverpool shirt. Was it wise to gamble £19m (provided the release clause was actionable) for Bony, essentially a back-up striker, at that point?

There is a Men's Human Rights Movement that raises awareness of miscarriages of justice like this, so it has nothing to do with his fame that there are people defending him for having consensual sex with a woman who didn't disagree that she gave consent or even claim that she was too drunk to consent, merely that she was to drunk to *remember* if she was in a fit state to consent.

Then I had to open up Photoshop, do a bit of tinkering to render it down from CMYK to only M and K ... and it looked fucking fantastic printed in the ad mag. That whole process procured me the grand total of one fucking phone call from a client, which led to an offer of three nights of work at a super cheap rate, which in turn led to maybe a couple of hundred gigs over the next eight years or so.

For the avoidance of doubt, I cannot express the levels of luck that I got away with, from taking a great head shot  with no photographic skill whatsoever, to making an eye-catching ad that worked despite technical limitations, to catching the eye of that one lead that turned golden.

I'm living in Nottingham currently and more recently I've developed Crohns disease resulting in me having spent nearly three months in hospital in the last couple of years. 

90% of the time communication with staff was not an issue in the slightest, but when it was a problem it was extremely frustrating.

I'm sure it'd be quite possible to ask for another member of staff who *can* speak decent English, and I'm sure the struggling staff member would be happy to oblige (they're probably just as frustrated). However by doing so you have the constant fear that you'll be judged as 'racist' or bigoted, so most people will just sit quietly nodding and hoping that their medical competence is somewhat better than their linguistic competence (which I'm sure it is).

Even if this only happens very occasionally I'm sure you'll agree that this isn't the ideal situation as it can lead to resentment on both sides....

* On the side of the staff member:   
    &gt; Racist fucker won't speak to a foreigner, only wants to deal with an ""English"" doctor

The Government of Ireland does not recognise or use the term and its embassy in London discourages its use. As a result, Britain and Ireland is used as an alternative description, and Atlantic Archipelago has had limited use among a minority in academia, although British Isles is still commonly employed.

The one thing you must absolutely do is find a third party who is willing to help you pay. The cash can come from you, but the offers must be made by a third party to be contractually sound! Google for the Pinnel case. 

The third party is relevant as if the offer is made via them (a friend, relative, whomever), it is far more difficult for the DCA to decide at the last second to say, ""We will take your money as partial settlement but we'll be persuing the rest"".

He's nearly left us a few times throughout the years, and despite him having reasons for it in terms of the club not offering pay-rises, new contracts etc., the mere fact that he's shown willing to leave already rules him out of the Carragher/Giggs category in terms of staunch, 100% unwavering loyalty. I think people sometimes forget just how close he was to signing for one of our (at the time) bitterest rivals in Chelsea.

To be perfectly honest, I'm happy for Stevie that he finally gets to experience football elsewhere.

You're missing the point, setting up a straw man. Of course people aren't going to want to be rapists, that's absurd and nobody is claiming it. But as he is in a position where he's  public figure as a result of being a footballer, people are goiing to be influenced by his words and actions. This could make people think that rape isn't rape, because he said what he did wasn't rape so it can't be, so it's okay for them to do it too. It could lead people to disbelieving victims of rape, which is already a problem (apparently innocent until proven guilty only applies to the accused, and not to the accuser, who is often instantly assumed to be guilty of lying).

It's about how his appointment will affect how rape is treated socially - who is believed, and what people think rape is or isn't.

The same isn't true with other sorts of crimes. Take F1 driver Adrian Sutil, for example. He was convicted of assault against a Lotus engineer. He still got a drive the next year, once he was out.

null,false,letsgocrazy,null,null,null,"&gt;Thanks for proving that you've not yet actually made it to puberty by posting that juvenile tripe. People try to influence the political process by donating money - the shock! the horror! - and since the ""bad guys"" have more money, they have more influence: the sheer, rapier-sharp handle on the inner workings of the political system revealed by this invaluable insight has got me in awe. The solution? well, let's make sure that everybody has the same amount of money, and fuck it if some people might be more committed or willing than others, personal freedom is great when I've got mine, sod everyone else's. 

That wasn't the proposed solution. 

Thank you for proving that the process of educating people like you needs to continue. 



&gt;Try thinking for yourself for once, and consider that the basic problem here is the fact that money is required to run a campaign in the first place, ie, that you need adverts on TV, merchandise, party politicals disguised as music shows. If people stopped looking at elections as a popularity contest, and just hunkered down, read about the policies proposed by each party and decided on that basis, there would be no need to do anything about money - simply because it would not be a factor. But since that requires personal effort (and does not generate a lot of YouTube ad revenue for wannabe commedians that are famous by virtue of insulting somebody's daughter on live radio and having been married with a pop star once), let's instead tilt at windmills from the comfort of your lounge. 

So on one hand you accept that people need to hunker down and start educating themselves about policies, yet on the other hand we need to spend millions on what amounts to a popularity contest. 

You're an imbecile involved in a conversation where you are simply out of your depth. 

You can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink. 

The facts are in front of you but you are arguing and struggling with them so much you aren't going to take them on board. 

There's no point having a conversation with you. 

To quote Frank Zappa - ""a mind is like a parachute, it only works when it's open"" 

If you want to continue arguing the toss and continue things as they are, with gross inequality, an unchecked financial elite that can take our nation to war, politicians in the pockets of big business, then you're complacency is as much a part of the problem as anything else. 

But change comes from within and if you aren't ready to hear someone else's viewpoint then no amount of explaining on my part can help you.

Lidl don't build out of town, they are within walking or cycling distance for a lot of people.

I'll admit that for the professional whose time is money, the extra efficiency or comfort of top of the range tools may make them worth the money.

I am ambivalent about buying stuff in bulk, it either gets lost, becomes obsolete or   gets wasted. For example UK homes throw away 7 million tons of food a year.

There's no doubt that life is so much easier with a pot of cash but we got started on this because of the boot theory.  There was an interesting exchange on the buy for life sub about boots. Person A swore by premiuim brand X which lasted 4 years and could be refurbished by the manufacturer for $75. Person B was happy with his Caterpillars which I guess cost about $75 and were lasting him 4 years. I'm happy just to rest my case that the boot theory in particular, is, er, cobblers.

The Greens strike me as a party of fractal level wrongness, the closer you look, the more batshit crazy they are.

We've focused on say CO2 only the last few years, my diesel car I know is awful for many reasons, but the governments have encouraged me to go this way.

I see Tesla, and I'm thinking in two years time, when my car is due to be replaced, I might actually get one of these ZEVs, assuming they have supercharger stations with battery swap out capabilities where I need them (Bristol).

Meanwhile they are going on about Railway, oh dear god no.  It's simply too expensive.  It was when it was nationalised in the first place, it was when it was privatised again, and continues to be.  The cost per passenger mile is mind boggling.

If they had said something about making a cycling infrastructure or similar, I might have had hope for them.  Frankly I think if we had decent segregated infrastructure and power assist bicycle hire schemes, we could easily reduce congestion in many London parts, weather issues not withstanding.

They fail to acknowledge just how efficient buses are, how low cost they are, and they want to stop having better infrastructure?!  Madness.  Say I wanted to visit my parents tonight.  It's 5h 15m on the train.  I can easily drive it in 4h 30m.  But worse yet, there isn't even a train after 4pm!  That is from our capital city, from any station available.  Not to mention, my eco diesel will do that on half a tank, £20.  The cheapest advance booked it 3 months ahead whilst agreeing to get a FGW tattoo ticket costs more than that, and I can take stuff or other people with me.

As for buying in bulk - you're thinking too big. Think more of a 6 pack of baked beans instead of buying singularly, or a 1kg bag of pasta instead of 100g bags etc.

To take a direct example from my own life, at work I use a LOT of gaffer tape.

I too have the same plan... :)

Of course they do, they would be the party by far to do the most here http://policy.greenparty.org.uk/tr.html


&gt; They fail to acknowledge just how efficient buses are

no they don't, they promote all public transport.  see above link

&gt; they want to stop having better infrastructure?! 

what?!  they will stop building new roads, not keeping up infrastructure...  

&gt; It's 5h 15m on the train. I can easily drive it in 4h 30m

That sounds like a great trade off to me!  I have a regular journey that is 2.5-3 hours car (m25 included so can easily jump to much more) or train for 3.25-3.5 hours.  I much prefer the train without the aggravation of other drivers.  However it is *much* too expensive (train) and needs to be lowered to get others to do the same.   In my case they even get me a peak fares when it's no longer peak and trains quite empty.  Outrageous!

Green policy is to add more trains/services.  Not sure if it would help you after 4pm but I can assure its the only party that may help you at all!

We knew it was bad, we were having some CO2 driven ideology, that ignored the externalities.  Back in 2007 I was reading an internal report for an un-named German organisation which has environmental responsibility in it's charter, and is taken quite seriously.  They were worried how one of their *green loans* had been used by a paint factory in Asia.  Sure they had reduced their CO2 emissions, and been able to trade that credit, but sadly, they'd poisoned a large body of water, devastating the local ecosystem in their carbon capture process.

I was more using it as a case of focusing on something being bad in isolation can have worse effects.  For some reason I'm remembering laughing at a bio on QI of Thomas Midgley...

&gt; I too have the same plan... :)

Which is worrying because our power infrastructure won't handle many people having that notion.  The greens energy generation plan simply doesn't add up.

&gt; If Greens got in power they would do all they could to reduce costs to get people off roads and lower C02 and likely re-nationalise

How?  The biggest costs is due to Victorian practices that are still common, good luck changing that without the RMT going full retard.  In London we can witness the microcosm of insanity that is how they react to modernisation of the underground.

Getting people off roads is a silly goal, almost as silly as the comments that when you build new roads people use them!  Roads are great, low cost, transport for the masses.  Buses/Coaches are the cheapest form, and often more environmentally friendly than rail.   Why not embrace that.

I should mention, I love trains, well steam trains, not keen on diesel ones, some electric ones I like, but I remember as a child learning to drive a steam loco and being in love with the machine, the engineering everything about it.  I was also lucky enough to have a grandfather who was enough of an engineer to go over in great detail how these things worked and the maths behind it.

But it has to be acknowledged, they are expensive, inherently inflexible, and such, just think of it this way, a trolly bus has a problem, a road has a massive hole because of a water leak.  It can detach from the overhead, run on it's gryo power, and go around it, mounting the pavement if need be.  A train is fucked.

Trains to be efficient have to be long, which means everyone arriving in one burst, this makes it harder all round for the infrastructure, as we get toward driverless systems that benefit is less, we've been speculating and experimenting with driverless 'bus trains' for ages, where slipstreaming to save energy is possible.

The need to run on rails strikes me as very 19th century.

&gt; no they don't, they promote all public transport. see above link

No, they don't, they talk about increased road useage as a negative thing.  Many countries have had electric buses in their cities for half a century.  No air pollution there.

&gt;what?! they will stop building new roads, not keeping up infrastructure...

Which is having better infrastructure.  That money is about upgrading too.

They have a goal, to put our money into resources which we can't directly own.  They want to socialise our transportation.   You can do that by making it better than the alternative, but seriously I doubt that they can, take my trip to my parents, how many people will want to do that at 7pm?  Not enough to fund it, so I will simply loose that option.  Yey, things are worse for me, go socialism.

&gt; That sounds like a great trade off to me!

No way.  The seats are to small for me (196cm) unless I'm in first class, even in first class I've not had a seat twice before, for 3+ hours (I recommend getting pissed in the vestibule area).

To be honest, even if it cost me £100 more to drive, I would, that time is worth saving, and ultimately the convenience and comfort of driving is higher, but I don't find driving hard like some people I know, the most I've driven in a day would be 18 hours, in a shit awful car, on poor terrain.  Actually, when the weather is good, I'll just fly myself down, as it only costs me 2 hours each way tops, however I've not yet found time to get my instrument rating, and the weather is normally shit in Cornwall, so I end up having to drive.

&gt; Green policy is to add more trains/services. Not sure if it would help you after 4pm but I can assure its the only party that may help you at all!

Not so, the Tory party have promised to improve the roads.  If that includes Cornwall, woopie, that will help.  Cornwall doesn't have 1 mile of motorway, and the main backbone road isn't even dual carriage way all the way.  As for fuel burn, this has significant effect, it costs me more to get from Exeter to Truro say, than it does from Exeter to London, despite the distances being longer, due to poor quality roads.  This is bad for the environment, as we have to burn more fuel.

Now I'll be honest, I don't think that Cornwall will see much of that.

I thought about hiring a friend of mine, but seriously I can't afford £15kpcm for him, which is still a pay cut from his current role.

Engineers such as him, do not cost £20k to train either.

The thing is, we're expecting 85+% of our revenue to be coming from outside the UK by the end of this year.

And I can get adequate engineers in other countries for £2k pcm.  Why would I hire in the UK?  It's probably easier for them to be a few hours ahead of UTC anyway.

There is a shortage, because there are lots of things that could be made or done, if good quality engineers were only say twice median wage.  The skills shortage is holding back the creation of things that benefit us all.

You have the right to say he shouldn't be hired.  Nobody disputes that.

I have the right to say he should be hired.

Frankly I think there is something unedifying and deeply unpleasant about a mob pursuing one man however horrible his conviction.

I also think there is something deeply unpleasant, and with more than a whiff of fascism, that saying the man should be punished not because of his own actions, but so as to encourage others.   


&gt; If his conviction is overturned, at that point the circumstances change.

Assuming for a moment, his conviction is overturned (I have no idea whether it will be), I won't hold my breath for that.

In the event his conviction is overturned, I fully expect the Guardian/twitter mob, to be talking about the appalling low conviction rates for rape, how this case sets a bad example and discourages reporting rapes, and how football clubs should not hire this rapist-who-got-away-with-it.

main point is most people will charge their cars at night, when power is spare.

Hostility isn't the same as identification and it's pretty clear that they've taken pains to ensure she can't be identified in the video on the website (despite her father's ridiculous claim that she can be identified without her face being shown). Also, it may well be that soon she is deemed not to have been the victim of a sex offence, in which case things will be very different.

You only need a few bankers to manage funds of billions - it makes economic sense to pay those guys millions as even a fraction of a percentage point improvement in performance would more than pay back such lavish compensation.

But now we are seeing this happen in programming etc. too as we see more outsourcing and standardised tools (so the developers of those tools make lots of money, the less skilled programmers that use them not so much). It is a process of deskilling the work so it becomes routine and then sending it the cheapest provider, much as happened in the manufacturing industry. This also makes tasks easier to automate entirely - reducing the marginal costs to near zero and destroying swathes of jobs in the process (although also freeing up money to be spent elsewhere, possibly creating more jobs due to the increased demand for goods and services - we shouldn't fall into the Luddite fallacy).

Basically increasingly being _very_ good at what you do will guarantee you a _very_  good wage. But being mediocre at it will get you nothing.

This is somewhat related to as the [hollowing out of the labour market (pdf warning)](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/250206/bis-13-1213-hollowing-out-and-future-of-the-labour-market.pdf) as we see the number of mediocre 'middle-class' jobs decline in favour of a highly skilled 'technorati' and a massive underclass (the 'precariat') in menial service roles, often on zero-hours contracts with little security or progression.

We are getting dangerously close to a situation where most people are simply surplus to requirement - how we change our economy and society for such a situation is an open question, but it is partly why ideas such as the [basic income](http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2013/11/government-guaranteed-basic-income) are becoming so popular - /r/BasicIncome has surprisingly good discussions about it.",null,0,null,1420635378,null,0,1420635708,0,cnh789k,null,t3_2rm34i,null,t1_cnh789k,null,t1_cnh5vck,null,null,null,1425012499,null,18,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,18,null

Being a role model is such a vague concept it's difficult to know how we should go about preventing convicted criminals from becoming them. What if he devotes a huge amount of his time to charity? Wouldn't he become a role model then? Should we prevent him from donating large amounts of time and money to those organisations? What if he starts a family? Would he not be a role model to his children? Should we sterilise the man?

So stopping people we don't like from becoming role models is meaningless. I understand why people don't like it, I hate the guy too, but not liking someone is not a good reason for resorting to heavy-handed, unenforceable punishments that hold little practical benefit.

If you haven't been able to maintain the financial discipline to build up enough savings to take a holiday, then you aren't going to magically find it in the future when you suddenly have to pay off a loan. Loans are for things that (hopefully) provide enough of a return on investment to justify their interest; houses, education, and (maybe) vehicles. Otherwise you're just trading having a little money now for having much less money later. There's no point in taking a holiday a couple months early if your repayments are going to prevent you taking a holiday for two years after that.

HOWEVER, there is an alternative. Instead of going on the expensive hotel-beach-bar holiday that most of your co-workers probably embark on, try a volunteering/enjoying-the-outdoors holiday. It's much more fun and much less expensive. I usually spend about 400-800GBP a month on this sort of holiday, so you could leave right away*. Check out /r/shoestring for ideas.

\* You could, but you shouldn't. An emergency fund of 3 months' expenses might be useful in case you can't return to your job when you come back.

If you plan to come over here after year 11, so when you arrive you'll go straight into learning A levels for two years, that's a good choice. If you come here any earlier then you'll have to complete GCSE's most probably which are level 2 qualifications. That's gonna be a lot of bother since most people do 8-12 GCSE's. 

Come here just to do A levels with an aim to go university though, and as long as you do good at school in the US I can't see why 9/10 colleges or sixth forms won't accept you into them to study A Levels.

But if you come here earlier, places may want you to have GCSE's. Usually a college or sixth form asks for ""5 A-C's including English and Maths"" which is kind of the education industry standard to get into A Level study. Some places will require certain grades, say a B in the GCSE version of the A Level you want to take before they let you in.

I'm hoping that if you come after year 11 is over, so at the start of year 12, usually that's the school year in which you'll turn 17, colleges and sixth forms may not need you to do GCSE's because I'm assuming you may have some kind of US equivalent to them. Honestly though, you're best off just giving the places you're considering going to a ring on the phone and asking them about entry requirements for an American student. They should give you an answer that's more useful than mine.

&gt; She has had to change identities five times, that is a fact.

I don't know if that is true or not, but I have no reason to doubt that it has happened. Still nothing to do with the website however.

&gt; Whether it aids the identification of her or not I would question, but it can't exactly help if her face is blurred or not.

Being that her face is pixelated out, I don't think it is reasonable to conclude that the website enables her identification.

&gt; It doesn't help his cause either as it is legally meaningless, as is the deleted tweets they uncovered.

I disagree, there is a moral component to this beyond the legal component and stating the facts about what happened helps people to understand what actually happened instead of most people's response to the word ""rape"", which people tend to associate with violence or an unwilling victim.

&gt; He may feel such a nasty view of someone is ""appropriate"" but it isn't.

It isn't appropriate to have a negative opinion on someone who is trying to destroy your life so as not to look a slut?

&gt; He seems to have a different idea of what rape is than other people and the legal system

He thinks that if she consents then it isn't rape. I think most people *would* agree with that.

&gt; a different view of what is acceptable to put online to other people

A video clip of someone whose face is hidden walking in and out of a hotel?

&gt; and a different idea of what sexual offenders out on license should be able to do

Find employment?

&gt; I feel somehow he will never get this.

I think he does get this and if he had raped anyone would be both ashamed and not draw attention to the fact.

Woh there, I remember taking kids round Didcot, which IIRC was at best about 40% 'efficient', many car engines are 35% efficient, so before transmission and storage losses have been taken into account, I don't believe that.

The only way Gerrard would stay is if he were a starter every week, quite rightly the club and Rodgers has reservations about it (and I think those reservations have been somewhat vindicated this season). There's no alternative but to let him go.

its is exactly the same principle as taking satisfaction and pleasure in someone who kidnapped and imprisoned someone innocent (like a little girl off the street) and kept her in a dungeon for 10 years ending up in jail.

no doubt your logic (and inability to understand that peoples innocence is the primary factor at work here,) would presumably condemn locking up someone whose crime was kidnapping and locking up someone from the street (false imprisonment) since.

""it makes you just as bad as the criminal""

if you would actively take pleasure/satisfaction in bringing someone to justice so that they go to jail for the crime of false imprisonment then you agree with my position , one is a deplorable crime because the victim is innocent the other is justice because the person inflicted suffering on the innocent. in both cases the action (imprisonment loss of liberty) is the same.

are you morally inferior that you take satisfaction in locking up people who falsely kidnap imprison people?

I think she doesn't want to be thought of as a slut and so has argued that she was raped rather than had sex with two guys consecutively, which isn't the same things as you are saying at all.

&gt; He, and clearly you, do not fundamentally understand the legal definition of rape. 

No, both of us clearly do understand the legal definition of rape and feel that someone who consented meaningfully, regardless of having drunk alcohol, has not been raped.

&gt; It is not just about finding employment, it is about walking from a rape sentence back into a footballing career as if nothing had happened.

Nothing other than the two and a half years spent in prison for something he didn't do? The shame and loss of friendships? The vilification from strangers who haven't read the case reports? The loss of a £20,000 per week contract? The ongoing battle to even return to the industry you've spent your whole life in? The ongoing opprobrium in the media and so on? You mean ""as if nothing had happened"" apart from those things, right?

Being that his crimes were said to have been committed over 30 years ago I'd be less concerned about it than if they had happened more recently.

Ok, so *migrants* are paid the same and the headline ‘the UK should pay for them’ is unfair, as they’re paid the same as Local doctors (as I’d expect?)

However Locum doctors are paid more – which makes sense to an extent as they’re expected to hot-desk depending on need rather than being consistently safe and employed in one place… 

…but the quality of some Locum doctors can deteriorate because they’re not fully versed in UK standard practice? 

If anything it sounds like the Locum doctors should require bespoke UK acclimatisation before being allowed to work here – but be eligible for a pay increase as a result due to their value. We’re not underpaying or mistreating migrants and Ops headline is misleading in that respect?

That money, for a subsidy has to come from somewhere.  Not to mention capacity, the Northern line is frankly busy enough as is.

&gt;__Hollywood__, historically known as __Killinkeyvin__  ([Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_language): *Cillín Chaoimhín*, meaning ""Kevin's little church""), is a village in west [County Wicklow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Wicklow), [Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland). It is situated on the [Wicklow Gap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R756_road) road, near its junction with the [N81](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N81_road_(Ireland\)) [national secondary road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_secondary_road). A population of less the 100 people registered in the [2002 Census](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_towns_in_the_Republic_of_Ireland/2002_Census_Records), though the community draws from a larger area which consists of about 500 people.

Training and results wise, they're largely the same.  IAM doesn't require retesting regularly, whereas RoSPA does, so there's an argument for RoSPA if we're talking lifelong skills.  RoSPA do encourage progress, but I'm not convinced it's any more pronounced than IAM; that said both require me to slow down considerably from my normal pace, so maybe if you're a bit more 'legal' in your riding style you might see a bigger difference.

Honestly, if you disagree with me, that's fine. You don't have to voice your disagreement that way though, it's not conducive to discussion at all.

I thought Gerrard gave the ball away a lot more than he usually does. He scored twice and won the game for us, but his overall performance levels, to *me*, did not reach the high standard which he has set over the past 15 I've seen watching him. I would hope it's obvious to everyone, especially seeing as Gerrard himself has acknowledged it, that he is starting to lose his legs. And that's fine because he's 35 and a midfielder, and you'd expect a player who was as mobile and injury prone as Gerrard was to lose their legs a lot quicker, which is testament to his work ethic and desire to remain a key player.

Let's not kid ourselves, though. He scored two goals in the FA Cup final in 2006, exactly the same as against Wimbledon, so his impact was the same (better, even, because we won the game outright), but obviously the performance wasn't.

Happy he bailed us out because we should be asserting ourselves against a League 2 side, even if (and credit to Wimbledon for doing it) they're playing great.
