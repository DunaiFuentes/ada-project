I didn't realise that being new to a particular forum (this is my only account on here) was more interesting the the points raised within it.
Article V only has meaning where we have the willpower and capability to enforce it, and at present it is essential and elaborate bluff due to the crippling cuts we've been subjected to. We need expansion and retrenchment across Europe, especially as American forces (75% of NATO funding and over 90% of its capability) relocate from the Atlantic to Pacific. If we don't want to be a part of Russia's sphere of influence, we have to pay what that's worth. A Kings Random in defence, not a penny in tribute.

In many cases, I think it's often the kids themselves. It's not like counter-cultural material (e.g. conspiracy theories, IS, you name it) is hard to find on the net. 

In our rush to see things in terms of simple dichotomies (good/evil, us/them) we forget how easily ideology, be it political, religious or whatever, catches on with the young and why that's the case. I remember how desperate I felt at that age, searching for some meaning and purpose to my existence in reaction to an adult world I, with all my [Dunning–Kruger effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) teen mentality, saw as being ideologically bereft and irredeemably corrupt. I became utterly nihilistic in my world view and it took a few years of education, exposure to great art, meeting a nice girl (or three), recovery from a serious illness and some plain old ""growing up"" for me to recognise that nihilist baggage as the brain-rot it was and cast it off entirely.

Fortunately I was raised as an atheist white boy so, during those bad years, I turned to drugs and parties. 

I imagine that things might have turned out *significantly worse* had I been a young Muslim kid, growing up dirt poor in some sink estate, surrounded by a culture that doesn't entirely trust me, attending a shit school and watching my parents slave away in shit jobs for crap pay; especially when the Muslim equivalent of Tyler Durden rocks up and offers me a path to finding meaning in this life (and paradise in the next) through revolutionary struggle. 

All of which isn't to excuse that horrible ideology and the people who follow it... only to say that I can see how alienated kids might find an attraction to it. There's a lot of reasons why some teenagers would give *anything* for a meaningful existence. 

The tragedy is that these girls (probably) think they're on their way to a meaningful life through True Islam when in actuality they're going to end up being passed around as rape-dolls for whichever members of the IS paramilitary cult find them first.

&gt; The only sad part is we won't be able to see their faces when the penny drops and they realise what a terrible terrible mistake they have made when they are passed around as toys for the soldiers.

1) No they didn't. They were offered the AV system, which nobody wanted (though it would be a marginal improvement on FPTP). 

2) Cameron *et al.* launched a campaign of fear and disinformation in a bid to retain a system that was favourable to them. Objectively, mathematically speaking, AV delivers a more representative government than FPTP, hence the repeated fabricated claims that AV was ""too complex"", ""gives some people two votes"" and is ""too expensive"".

3) Clegg was about as popular as cholera at the time, and a no vote to AV was seen as much a way to kick the Lib Dems for failed election promises as much as it was seen as an exercise in democracy. 

4) People, overwhelmingly, are idiots, and don't know what's best in them (or those that aren't stupid are beneficiaries of an unfair voting system, and vote unscrupulously). I don't say this because I disagree with their opinion, I say this because AV is an objectively better system than FPTP if you believe representation in parliament to be an important measure of democracy. 

Given that approximately one third of the electorate intend to vote for parties that aren't Labour or the Conservatives at the upcoming general election, I think it's a bit of a stretch to say the argument on electoral reform is done and dusted. If the likes of UKIP and the Greens get more popular without seeing comparable parliamentary representation, there will be a lot of disillusioned voters out there (in fact there already are.

Regardless of what he did afterwards.. overtaking (and in fact, by the sound of it.. you failed to complete that overtake safely) someone before making a left turn is completely the wrong thing to do.

The cyclist made a mistake, but your attempt to overtake before making the turn compounded his mistake and made it potentially dangerous. I'm glad you noticed his mistake and made up for yours, but I don't think either of you were innocent in the incident.

I'm not trying to be a dick about it, I'm just worried that your lack of reflection of your own driving means you're not learning from the incident (I hope the cyclist did too).",null,0,null,1424452471,null,0,false,0,corma90,null,t3_2whann,null,t1_corma90,null,t1_corkwnp,null,null,null,1424697551,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Look at some of the piss poor goals we've conceded: Villa away, United away, QPR at home, et al. It's symptomatic of a bigger problem, but not one that's characterised by a lack of positivity.

I love Luiz, but at the top of his deficiencies is his penchant for losing concentration which is really what I'd argue has been the root of our struggles in the bigger games this season. Ronay forgets that in each of the games he alluded to, we scored first; it wasn't a lack of positivity that cost us, it was a lack of concentration that enabled the opposing team to find their equaliser.

The specific 'protest' which led to the coup against Yanukovich was the one held in Kiev outside government buildings. Is that how democracy should be conducted? If a London mob entered Westminster and Downing Street and forced the Prime Minister to flee the country and a new one to come to power, I doubt you'd talk about it in such favourable terms or view it as evidence that the whole of the UK had chosen this course of action. Support for joining the EU was about 50% in the lead-up to the incident. The constitutional measure to impeach Yanukovich through a Parliamentary vote was carried out, and the required number of voted was not met. Since then, people in Eastern Ukraine have been cut off from the democratic process for obvious reasons.

The idea that events in Ukraine were some great national pro-EU, pro-NATO movement is a vainglorious distortion by the Western political and media classes - it was a localised and undemocratic coup by a largely liberal and pro-Western urban demographic against a president whom Parliament had chosen not to impeach and who had acted rationally and within the constitution in rejecting the EU Free Trade Agreement.",null,0,null,1424454565,null,0,false,0,cornjsd,null,t3_2wj976,null,t1_cornjsd,null,t1_coriuqj,null,null,null,1424698141,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

If you start by ruling out everything where the return (after charges) is below inflation, the options that remain can be sorted by risk and return and you can pick from that short list.

For example that exemption was created to bring the UK inline with most of the rest of the EU where similar exemptions already existed.

Consider how it would change incentives if the UK didn't have it:

* It would encourage companies looking to sell subsidiaries to relocate their HQs to elsewhere in the EU taking their (regular) tax payments with them.

* It would encourage acquirers to buy subsidiaries of EU companies over those of UK companies as UK subsidiaries will end up being priced at a 20% premium to account for the tax implications.

Really? I don't think you're giving Andros enough credit. I feel like he often puts in really nice balls to the back post or gets to the byline and stands the ball up really nicely. I think he's by far the best crosser on our team.

Though that doesn't take away from your overall point. Lamela's killer balls generally come from through balls from what I can remember.

I am sorry, but I'll have to disagree on this. He is suing the club there by claiming that the club was responsible for what happened to him. What he is doing is painting the club I love in a bad manner and I do think that is unfair and unwanted. 

I am not saying him filing the lawsuit makes him any less of a victim. What I am saying is that he is not the only victim here. The club's reputation has taken a really bad hit due to this incident. The club is also a victim in this case and has had to suffer abuses from multiple sources. The fans and players are being called racist. His lawsuit will further vilify the club unnecessarily is what I am saying.

-Find a dealer, extort them for a few grand. 
-If they fail to pay up, beat/shoot em. Scare em out of business. 
-If they pay up, then keep taxing them in larger amounts and milk the cash cow.
-The dealers have nowhere at all to turn cos theyre in a black market.
It's probably not intentional (they just want cash) but they are just running a protection racket for dealers. 

They claim to be politically aligned and doing a community service but they're total hypocrites because they'll rob a dealer and use the cash to buy their weekends drugs from another dealer.   Proper groups want nothing to do with them and see them as an issue but nobody wants to kick up a stink and risk exposing the whole scene to public scrutiny.

Suggested solution: Legalise, Regulate and Tax the (soft) drug market for the UK and Ire.
Free up cops to focus on harder drugs (heroin) and also use the tax to further support the police. Alongside that, fund educationial programs to set in motion a sensible attitude to drug and drink use for future generations. 

If the government thinks this is the best approach for alcohol then why would it not be sensible for cannabis? ie Bouncers relieve the police of some work and there are plenty of drink-drive, responsible drinking campaigns.

Technically a coffee shop selling weed doesn't come close to the negative impact of a Pub. Who ever gets really baked and then wanders out into the street being loud, aggressive or starting a fight? How many weed smokers end up in A&amp;E every weekend? Who's died from weed in the past decade?

Depends on whether you are still benefiting from the bad things your ancestors did. For example many fortunes were built on the slave trade and that money still exists now.

So while we are collectively not responsible, some families *are* responsible and are still benefiting from their ill-gotten gains and they should feel thoroughly ashamed of themselves.",null,0,null,1424460807,null,0,false,0,corrh12,null,t3_2wj7kc,null,t1_corrh12,null,t1_cordl2f,null,null,null,1424700026,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

5. Varane - really seeing him slot so perfectly at the clasico, at 18, was amazing. He's really something special.

4. Courtois - He'll be the best keeper in the world easily, already number 2. And he's so much better than DDG

Yes.  The ""last man"" phrase is just one way people try to explain the denial of an obvious goal scoring opportunity.  The way the law is written and interpreted is to give a red if a player is fouled to prevent an obvious goal scoring opportunity, which typically means that he would have been in a position to shoot with just the keeper to beat.  From the replay, it looked like he was just about to shoot when pulled off balance, and McCarthy wasn't going to be in the area to challenge that shot.

e.g.

noun: American

verb: Americanize

The problem came about because uneducated people didn't know when a word was supposed to end in -ise and when it should end in -ize.

e.g. surprise vs criminalize. Criminal becomes a verb by adding -ize, but surprise isn't derived from a noun, so it ends in -ise.

Two different words but with the same *sound* at the end.

I still disagree though. Thinking of the world as one group will, one day, probably make sense. 

In the meantime: gays being thrown off of roofs, women stoned to death, people executed for witchcraft and people being killed and persecuted because of their religion in the Middle East. A deep rooted xenophobia in many cultures of Asia, especially Japan. Genocide as recently as 1990's in Africa. Mafia-tier gang activity in Russian politics and business. Vast areas of the US where ultra-violent gang culture is the norm. Mexican drug cartels who would think nothing of killing a whole bus full of civilians as a means of making a name for themselves. 

If you want to pool yourself in to this group of people and truly believe you are no different, you be my guest. 

I think the other side of the argument is a bit more realistic and has more self respect. Our country and culture simply wouldn't allow for those things to happen.

Of course there are some horrible people doing horrible things in this country, but to pretend our national mindset is anything like these countries' is preposterous.

Doable, definitely. And we'd even save money on his wages compared to Yaya. 

The biggest problem (assuming Juve are willing to sell) is Real, but they already have 4 undroppable midfielders in their 4-3-3 - they are struggling to balance Isco, Modric, Kroos and Rodriguez as it is, only injuries have really meant someone isn't getting unhappy on the bench. Adding in another undroppable player wouldn't really be possible. I don't know who they are going to sell either because Kroos + Rodriguez just arrived, Isco is the darling of the club and Modric is probably only second to Ronaldo in terms of importance in the team. Not a surprise to anyone their form has gone downhill with him injured. That's not even mentioning Khedira who is still world class if he can stay fit and Lucas Silva who just arrived as well. 

Is it possible Pogba is moving at a time when Perez literally can't justify selling a vital player to sign a galactico _again_? 

Anyway I don't expect us to get Pogba, we are definitely the least likely of the teams involved, but there's enough of a chance to make it interesting.

There's also a National Rail phone app, which gives realtime updates of train progress and sometimes will also be a way to find out the platform number in advance of arriving at the station.

If the first train is delayed, then you'll be able to catch a later one - this applies even if you're on an advance ticket which is only valid for a specific service. If this happens, just find station staff at Bristol and ask them for help, they'll be able to endorse the ticket as valid for a later train.

But I've personally suffered the level of intolerance comparable to what he's suffered, as a Jewish person who used to live in Russia, and while I know from personal experience that it's extremely hurtful, using a clear hyperbole and calling it horrific diminishes the plight of people who actually do suffer horrifically due to discrimination.

Of course you do. Everyone does. But thats not the point at all. It's the principle of the matter.

I'm getting really tired of this blinding Balo circlejerk here. The Balotelli criticism is completely warranted here. He just did something that Gary Neville described as ""one of the most despicable preaches of team spirit you can possibly have.""

If you do miss your connection however it shouldn't matter, as if you miss your booked connection due to no fault of your own (like a delay) then they have to honour your booking and let you travel on the next available train. You might have to get someone at Bristol to confirm this for you though, before you get on the train to York, if that does happen though. 

There are lifts on each platform, if your luggage is heavy, but the stairs aren't too bad either, as Temple Meads is linked by one long subway. 


As already stated, the luggage racks on the Cross Country trains (Bristol - York) are a bit rubbish. Although I do believe one carriage has more racks than the others? But not to worry, you'll find somewhere to cram it, just maybe get yourself ready a few mins before arriving into York.

Nothing in my day to day experience will probably be of use to you as I never did any of the lower year biomed modules but the majority of the faculty I encountered were nice and helpful.

The campus itself (at least the victorian parts of it) is lovely and is one of the most beutiful parts of Glasgow, especially on a sunny day (although if you're doing biomed subjects I think quite a few of your lectures and seminars will probably be in the Boyd Orr Building- you have my sympathy). If you're going to live in uni accomodation just be aware that many of the halls are some distance away from the campus, but the SRC runs minibuses to them all.

I know you'll only have one term but make sure you explore more of Glasgow than just Gilmorehill. There's lots to do in the city, no matter what you enjoy. As people have said, it's the largest city in Scotland with a huge student population. It's less touristy than Edinburgh, there's less standout tourist attractions and sightseeing to be done (although all that sort of stuff is a day-trip away). I don't think of that as a bad thing.

Sure why not.

I was born middle class and grades were never the problem for me. 

Mahmood's example only further illustrates how there's an underlying nihilistic psychology that can lead the young into being enticed into radicalisation. When someone with so much going for them, in material, practical terms, can throw it all away and join an awful cult then you can bet there's more going on under the surface.

Perhaps you were accused of stealing a car, you went to court, were found to be not guilty by a jury of your peers, and you went home to go back to your normal life. Phew! It's all over.  
Except that by allowing retrials, it's never over. The prosecution didn't like the verdict. They blame the jury or the judge or the weather. They get you charged with the same offence again, and you go back to court to repeat the whole ordeal. Lathe, rinse, repeat.  
It's for this sort of reason that once you're acquitted, that's it. It's also the reason that prosecutors sometimes drop cases you think they'd be eager to take to court. They know they have limited resources and only one shot at a conviction, so they need to be damned sure they have all their ducks in a row before they bring a case. If they think there's evidence isn't persuasive or conclusive enough, they'll sit on it until something more substantial emerges.  
But back to your query. Since 2005, some offences *can* see the defendant back in the dock even after they've been acquitted. But it's difficult to do. You need the court of appeal to quash the original verdict, and you need the agreement of the director of public prosecutions. You need some new case facts/evidence which was not available at the original trial - and this can only be arranged for certain serious offences. The [Crown Prosecution Website](http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/p_to_r/retrial_of_serious_offences/) has much more detail on this.  
You mentioned molestation. I can't be sure if this is likely to qualify as a serious offence under the terms of the Criminal Just Act 2003, as that's not the formal title of the offence. If you can find out what the actual offence was, you can look it up [in the legislation](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/44/schedule/5).",null,0,null,1424470771,null,0,false,0,corxca3,null,t3_2wkw0m,null,t1_corxca3,null,t1_cortr52,null,null,null,1424702834,null,6,false,LegalAdviceUK,t5_32g6u,6,null

Vlaar, on around £40,000 per week, is out of contact at the end of this season and is understood to have told Villa of his intention to explore his options. Manchester United and Southampton are admirers.

The 30-year-old starred under Louis van Gaal at last year's World Cup and is aware his next decision will be hugely important after reaching a watershed age.

Vlaar returned with an impressive display against Leicester after six weeks out through a knee injury and Sherwood would like him to stay.

'I’m not sure what the club have done with that,' he said of negotiations. 'Obviously the club want to keep their best players. I’m sure the club will endeavour to try and keep Ron.

'It’s not really for now. The focus is picking the right team and Ron focusing on playing and doing the best for the club.

'I was very impressed with him. You need experience. They have experienced themselves getting out of trouble at the end of the season. We need to try and do that this season and then try to look forward. First things first we need to stay in the division.' 

Despite Villa sitting 18th without a win in 10 Premier League games, Sherwood is confident. 'I am grateful for the opportunity here and I will give it everything,' he said. 'All I can do is my best and I think my best is going to be good enough.'

He was discharged a few months after coming home and he spent the best part of three years living with his mother. He was too afraid to leave his house and literally never left the house in those three years. His army mates would always visit his house whenever they could but he would always tell his mother to tell them that he wasn't at home and in the end they just gave up on him.

His mum didn't know what to do, she had called all the mental health support lines but they kept telling her that there's nothing they can do unless he calls them himself. At one point she would call doctors pretending that she was too sick to get out of bed so they would do a home visit and when they'd come out to the house she would try to bring them up to talk with her son but they all refused.

His mother would always make him a cup of tea and a round of toast every morning. One morning he never came down stairs to get his breakfast so his mother brought it up to him. He absolutely hated anyone going into his room so she left it outside his door and shouted ""your tea is going to get cold lad!"". An hour later she checked to see if it he had taken it and he hadn't. She walked up the stairs and into his room to find that he had hung himself.

The government contributed £1400 to the funeral because his mother was on a low income, I and a few others also put money towards it so she wasn't left with any debt. At the crematorium there was hardly anybody there. Me, his mother, his aunt and a few others. Nobody officially from the army came, actually his mother said she didn't even receive a phone call, letter or a card offering condolences from the army.

So, you don't know much about deaf community then. There are a lot of hearing people in deaf communities. Even if you meant deaf culture, you would be still wrong.

&gt;It's a bit like having a community of people who can't draw, or a community of people who aren't very good at cricket. The ""deaf community"" is just a self-imposed ghetto.

Bad analogy.

Rodgers isn't stupid. He knows what contribution Balotelli made on that game. But sometimes when you have Balotelli type players in your team, you need to have a harsh relationship with him rather than a soft relationship with him.

Assuming you can't access the above, your next best bet is probably an ISA. The current top payer in the easy access category is the Post Office at 1.5% (so £45 a year on your £3k). If you fix for a few years you might get 2.25%. 

So basically your £3k, unfortunately, isn't going to earn you very much at current interest rates. 

Other options: plonk it in Ratesetter (fix for a year at 4.4%, or for 3 years at 6%), if you want to up your risk a bit you could try Funding Circle (lending to businesses). These are both P2P lenders which I use. 

Or you could dabble in shares. This would be more if you were interested in learning about shares and wouldn't be too bothered about losing some money (potentially quite a bit). Or you could play it safe but still buy equities and buy a tracker, .e.g. a FTSE 100 (which is on the brink of a record high) tracker. If the FTSE 100 goes up, the value of your investment goes up. If it goes down, well, I think you can guess what happens. 

What would I do? For me, I wouldn't bother stashing it away. I would use it to help me - you're at a stage in your life when you need all the money you can get. £3k is almost not worth saving, if it means you'll have to work while at uni. Concentrate on your studies. Or spend your time networking. Or even just enjoy your time at uni to the full, without having to worry about money. You're only young once, don't forget that.

I absolutely agree with this. I love Sturridge, and think he and Henderson were both doing what they thought was right. If I were to guess at what happened, Rodgers probably has told Mario in the past that he is to take the pen if Gerrard isn't on the field. It seems like something that a player would ask the coach about if they like taking penalties. Henderson might not have known this, but knew he was to take the penalties for the game. Once Mario came on the situation changed, but again, Henderson didn't realize it. Somebody that had captained the team a little longer might know the order, but Henderson didn't at the time. Gerrard probably doesn't even realize this, because he knows if he's on the field, he's taking the penalty.

I really think right now the whole situation is sorted for the team, it's a simple misunderstanding, and not a big deal. It's the media and us making the big deal out of it now. Maybe it's a bit Rodgers' fault for not clarifying the order to the team and especially Henderson, maybe it's a bit Henderson's fault for not knowing the order, but at this point it doesn't matter. Slight oversight, I'm sure everything's fine on the team level. I just don't think it's an outrage that Mario took it, or that he was really out of line for taking it.

However, I think these private parking companies irk people because more often than not the news about them that comes to light is like that mentioned in the article - £100 charges for staying 10 minutes longer than the time limit in a 20p per hour carpark, or in my case, an £80 charge for parking in a free leisure park carpark in an unmarked, overflow area which the landlord even showed cars parking on in their own website (pointing that out to them was how I had my charge waived). 

There's a boarded up pub by my local railway station which has 5/6 spaces outside, all of which are always in use, presumably by commuters heading to/from London. I've never seen barriers or the like, but I've likewise never seen anything actively inviting people to dump their cars there for the day. I agree, if the landowner hasn't agreed to this, then there should be some sort of penalty because people are basically just being opportunist. But there's a world of difference between that sort of piss-taking and the piss-taking levied by the leisure park/supermarket carpark guys who seem to hover in unmarked cars waiting for shoppers to trip up so they can slap the windscreen with an invoice stating insane fees plucked out of thin air.

Coincidentally, or perhaps not, these were the exact claims that ASMW were making. These rumours eventually made it into the press which perhaps made them think there was credence to them but the press, as we know, just scour the internet looking for something to turn into an article.

It's important to point out that the line ""the documents revealed discussions had taken place involving an updated design of the Spurs stadium and increasing its capacity by 5,000."" is a reflection of what ASMW claimed in court. I don't think those documents have been made public so we can't verify that claim although we might infer that the claims are true since Spurs didn't deny them. Even if they are true, there's a huge difference between discussing something and doing it. The club would still need planning permission even if they've secretly redesigned. In fact, the clubs QC said on day two ""There is no evidence of the club having made a decision to pursue any changes to the scheme.

People are taking the wrong end of the stick regarding Rodgers' comment. It's fairly clear that Rodgers thinks Balotelli will get better if he demands more of him rather than praise him. It's a common football tactic, that when a player gets comfortable and complacent, you either fire him up with derogatory comments like this or sell him, because there's a good chance that being comfortable means lesser performances (something people point as the reason for Reina's downfall).

Rodgers isn't stupid. He knows what contribution Balotelli made on that game. But sometimes when you have Balotelli type players in your team, you need to have a harsh relationship with him rather than a soft relationship with him. Every player has a different type of relationship with the manager because not everyone is the same. And there are different ways of treating someone as a manager. Sometimes, you need to be patient and praise them and other times you need to be almost militaristic with them.

Rodgers isn't trying to put Balotelli down. He knows that if Balotelli hasn't got a leash on, he will be unfocused and thus lazy. I am 100% sure Rodgers knows that Balotelli isn't lazy. But by saying this, Rodgers doesn't give Balotelli an inch of leeway.

Lloyds offer an account with 5% interest on balances up to £2k (not quite the £3k OP wants to save). You need to pay in £500 a month but you can just transfer it out and then back in each month.

Henderson who was a looked down on as joke after his first season has flourished to become probably the most key member of the team, and one our best players and future captain under his guidance. Awful.

Sterling and Ibe bought through and eased into becoming some of the finest talents in european football. Sterling sent on holiday after an extended run in the squad so he doesn't over-exert himself didn't work either?

How about when he benched Migs, had a big chat with him and Migs came back in the finest form he's ever been in, in a Liverpool shirt. I guess all the credit should just go to his fiance. 

Or how about putting Can as CB in our new formation, he got that working okay too.
He had a few gaffes, but I'm sorry, his man management isn't really up for debate.

Sterling has been as effective if not more so as a CAM than as a winger. I'd imagine Ibe would similarly do well in that role. Markovic is originally a CAM and we also have Lallana &amp; Coutinho as well as some promising youngsters like Ojo coming through.

Teixeira is already older than all but 2 of our 1st team CAMs (those being Lallana &amp; Coutinho) and he's nowhere near the ability of them.

Tottenham have the lowest net spend in the Premier League over the past 5 years, they have actually made a *profit* from transfer dealings over that time. So none of the profit from being a successful club has been spent on the team in that time and has instead been saved for the stadium. 

To put that into perspective Chelsea, ManCity and ManU have net spends approaching £300,000,000 over those 5 years while Arsenal, Liverpool, West Ham and QPR have net spends of around £100,000,000. Tottenham over that same period have made a *profit* of £22,000,000.

Also the article uses average attendance as evidence completely neglecting the fact that Spurs play early round European games every year which always see low attendance. A much better indicator would be to look at the season ticket waiting list of which Spurs' is 40,000 long...

BBC Four is a thing that exists, a channel broadcasted by the BBC in the UK. But it is completely ambiguous to call it ""BBC Channel 4"". ""Channel 4"" is a separate company completely.

&gt;__Ulsterisation__ refers to one part - ""primacy of the police""  - of a three-part strategy (the other two being ""normalisation"" and ""criminalisation"") of the [British government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_government) during the conflict known as [the Troubles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles).  The strategy was to disengage the non-[Ulster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster) regiments of the [British Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army) as much as possible from duties in [Northern Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland) and replace them with members of the locally-recruited [Royal Ulster Constabulary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Ulster_Constabulary) (RUC) and [Ulster Defence Regiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_Defence_Regiment) (UDR). The objective of this policy was to confine the effects of the conflict to Northern Ireland.

I'm happy to give credit for his work with our youth here.  And I surely appreciate that he brought Bentaleb and Kane into the first team when he was manager.  

But every week he finds a new and ever more obnoxious way to say ""Look at me, I'm so fucking great.""  At least get someone else to say it for you, and then let your ""legacy"" speak for itself.  (Seriously, I don't think I've ever heard anyone actually talk up *their own* legacy before.)

edit: Also, it's utterly disrespectful to all the other people who had a significant hand in  building our youth system.  He talks like it was all him.  ""I"" ""me"" ""myself"" ... fuck off.  Youth development, like most things, is a team effort.  Admittedly, we're not seeing the whole interview here, but in all the quotes and interviews I've seen of his, I've never heard him share credit with anyone.

The halls are nice though.  I was at Churchill Hall, and my room was well-sized and had all the essentials, so I can't complain. 

The University precinct itself is pretty cool.  It's near a lot of food shops, which (trust me) is very good for when you have a seven-hour lab and need to go grab some food.

As for the work; this is where my experience might be a bit different from what you'd experience, as I am studying Physics, rather than a Biological science.  But in Physics at least, in first year we were graded on January and June module exams, as well as coursework during term, and lab work.  In second year, however, we are graded solely on lab work and the January/June exams.

Crystal Palace-Scum: Palace are playing decent of late, and going to Selhurst isn't an easy fixture, ask Liverpool... Lol. Plus, Bolasie is back, which is a big help, especially against an inexperienced right back. Expecting him to light that side up. 
Prediction: 2-1 Palace

Hull-QPR: Will be interesting to see how these two teams approach the game with interim managers at the helm. It's relegation battle time, and this should be an exciting game. Both need points, and these are both teams the other needs to beat if they want safety. Only problem is Hull capitulate when they need points the most, and QPR the opposite. 
Prediction: 3-1 QPR

Sunderland-West Brom: Such a blah game it's unbelievable. Both are stuck in limbo where they're not the worst of the League, but they are nowhere near the quality of say even 13 on up. 
Prediction: 1-1 draw

Swansea-Man U: Swans at home are always tough, and even without Bony they'll put up a fight. United are notoriously bad on the road.
Prediction: 2-2 draw. 

Man City-Newcastle: City are starting to feel the pressure of that gap again and will want to ensure they stay tight to Chelsea, while I expect a typical performance from a Newcastle side who are happy to stay midtable this time of year. 
Prediction: 3-1 City

Everton-Leicester: Europa League hangover? This could be a tricky game against a desperate relegation favorite who have had an extended break. Fresh legs against those who played on Thursday as well as a potentially unfit Baines could be troublesome. 
Prediction: 1-1 draw 

Southampton-Liverpool: I expect a shootout. This has all the signs of a game asking for lots of goals, both teams liking to move the ball quickly, and possess significant amounts of speed. Liverpool are shaky at best at the back, and Southamptons D has looked less than stellar since the turn of the year. 
Prediction: 3-3 on a late equalizer. 

Spurs-Wet Spam: Good thing we are playing at home, because the situation regarding the passing of their fans last week is a huge rallying point for their fans, and it for sure would have made for an intense atmosphere. We've looked good at home and they will sorely miss Carroll. Could also be missing both CB.

The other thing would be to start Lallana over sterling. Just coming back from a short break he might benefit from another sub appearance. I also think Lallana could go after Southampton and score.
