null,false,chamber37,,Joe le Tactics,null,"Ehh... I wanna say that's not really a fair comparison.

Yes it sucks that we let Cahill go, but he *wanted* to leave. O'Neill couldn't guarantee him games to make him stay -- because Mellberg and Laursen; which is understandable -- and Cahill wanted to play regularly, not wait around for an injury to give him a chance... which is also understandable. Funnily enough, had Cahill been willing to wait 6-12 more months at Villa, he probably *would* have become a starter at CB, but there's no way he could have known that at the time.

So yeah... it wasn't a case of ""not good enough"" but rather, not as good as probably the two best centre backs Villa have had in the past 15 years. Not *really* the same situation for Baker.

While Baker could become a decent Premier League CB in future, I see no problem letting him go for the right price. Given his injury troubles, and that his development has slowed of late (at least partly because of limited game time; and he's not likely to get much more of that if he stays) then it makes sense to allow him to leave.

Don't get me wrong, I like the guy... but the fact of the matter is, he's our fourth choice centre back, and needs to be playing football if he's to reach his potential. Training with good players helps, but he also needs to be playing matches to make the most of that. It serves neither us nor him to have him rotting on the bench or in the reserves right now.

A loan is an option but not ideal, either. We can't loan him to a Premier League club near our own level, because we'd be strengthening a possible rival if we're sucked into a relegation battle again. Teams above us probably wouldn't want him -- why would they if he can't get into a supposed relegation battling side? -- and Championship clubs are a step down in quality from last season, so not really the level of quality we'd want him to be facing in order to maximise his development.

As much as we might not like it, and as much as it might come back to bite us in the arse later... If we can get paid, and he can get played, a transfer is probably the best option for everyone involved.",null,0,null,1438199893,null,0,false,0,ctkodwm,null,t3_3f24hs,null,t1_ctkodwm,null,t1_ctkkt4e,null,null,null,1440163531,null,9,false,avfc,t5_2s569,9,null

Up until very recently the common medical opinion was that dietary fat was one of the main causes of obesity &amp; heart disease, this is now in question. How quickly will they be made to loose weight in order to continue to get the benefits? Rapid weight loss can be dangerous &amp; if the loss isn't managed carefully can leave lasting physical problems.

Many people still believe people get fat because they don't exercise enough, but with the amount of calories a lot people consume through processed food &amp; soft drinks you couldn't exercise away if you tried. Our nutrition education is appalling (at least mine was), most food advertised is heavily processed, and worse is we had been reducing Fat content in food based on the above misconception &amp; making up for the taste by adding large amounts of Sugar which is possibly the culprit all along.

I am all for taking positive steps to change this, but we need to start young &amp; completely overhaul how we educate our children about food. Teach them nutrition as early as possible, actually teach them how to cook &amp; prepare food. Every time I bring this up people complain that parents should be teaching this but they obviously aren't so we need to fix this at a national level. 

Add to this we need to deal with what in my opinion is one of the core reasons we have a problem with obesity &amp; processed food : the perception that processed food is cheaper than fresh food. People now are not only money conscious but also time poor so we must ensure that people are able to buy the ingredients for fresh, healthy food cheaper than processed garbage, and that they have the time to prepare it.",null,0,null,1438200665,null,0,false,0,ctkoyn3,null,t3_3f0whp,null,t1_ctkoyn3,null,t1_ctke8op,null,null,null,1440163803,null,2,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,2,null

The risk is only exacerbated by the fact that, at the end of the day, we haven't got the same sort of pulling power that most other Premier League clubs have, meaning that we aren't pulling the guys that are highly likely to prove successful, but rather those who could be hit and miss.

While truly advanced tactics will require fairly dense reads to understand, if you are simply looking to understand the basic rules to the chess match evident in every match I'd give that game a shot if you've ever got time.

In terms of sources you can read, [FourFourTwo](http://performance.fourfourtwo.com/tactics) has some excellent articles and answers a lot of questions we fans might have. For example their most recent article: ""Dealing with a Quick Winger"" touches on a question most of us have probably wondered about ourselves.

Additionally, /r/NevillePunditry has some clips that explain concepts remarkably well. Watching Match of the Day will give you a little bit more insight, but it is usually very preoccupied with the Top 4 clubs.

For Swansea specific news I would recommend [The JackCast](http://thejackcast.com/). While not always specifically tactical, its a podcast that discusses club news and reviews performances.

To be honest usually an understanding of tactics comes with time as well. You don't need to study like you're shooting for your Continental A License or anything, just watch the game with an eye towards tactics and don't be afraid to ask questions. 

For example, if you see a player ripping our defence to shreds in the first half, try to watch for how Monk adjusts to the threat.

Do that and a bit of reading here and there, and you'll know more than most the people watching the games in the pub pretty quickly.",null,0,null,1438200990,null,0,false,0,ctkp7b0,null,t3_3f21d3,null,t1_ctkp7b0,null,t3_3f21d3,null,null,null,1440163916,null,5,false,swanseacity,t5_2tip4,5,null

Has the potential to be our best season, granted we have had a phenomenal season and finished our highest ever in the Premier League, we have only sought to build upon what we already have. We expanded our team depth and brought in very smart transfers, whilst holding onto (so far) players that are crucial to our team and have played phenomenally all season like Ki/Ashley Williams/Fabianski. I honestly see us in Europa the following season, this season I expect us at least in the top 10 and pushing hard for a domestic cup win. 

Which player is going to be your star of the season and why?

I think our midfielders and wingers are going to be our stars, I am not going to single anyone out because it is early days. Montero and Ayew will probably be the stand outs as whilst Montero looked filthy last season, Ayew will also look to build on our winger quality. Also forgot to mention that I think if Barrow gets game time, he will  replace Dyer/Routledge in the pecking order, hes looked very good from recent content videos. Whilst our midfielders, Cork/Ki/Shelvey all provide their own unique quality, Shelvey has moments of sheer brilliance that can win games, Cork is a steady rock and Ki seems to be a full package midfielder. 

How do you think the team will line up? 

Difficult to say, this is our first season where we've had such a huge squad depth. I'm not entirely sure who gets given priority. ",null,0,null,1438201281,null,0,1438201497,0,ctkpf4f,null,t3_3f2lbl,null,t1_ctkpf4f,null,t3_3f2lbl,null,null,null,1440164018,null,5,false,swanseacity,t5_2tip4,5,null

null,false,jorelpogi,null,null,null,"   It all started when our hero, Jose, woke up in a cornfield. It was the ninth time it had happened. Feeling really pleased, Jose deflowered a fork, thinking it would make him feel better (but as usual, it did not). A few minutes later, he realized that his beloved Fingerprint was missing!  Immediately he called hisundefined, Rafa. Jose had known Rafa for (plus or minus) 2,000 years, the majority of which were eccentric ones.  Rafa was unique. He was congenial though sometimes a little... abrasive. Jose called him anyway, for the situation was urgent.

   Rafa picked up to a very unctuous Jose. Rafa calmly assured him that most capybaras panic before mating, yet otters usually earnestly turn red *after* mating. He had no idea what that meant; he was only concerned with distracting Jose.  Why was Rafa trying to distract Jose?  Because he had snuck out from Jose's with the Fingerprint only two days prior.  It was a enchanting little Fingerprint... how could he resist?

   It didn't take long before Jose got back to the subject at hand: his Fingerprint. Rafa turned red. Relunctantly, Rafa invited him over, assuring him they'd find the Fingerprint. Jose grabbed his bed and disembarked immediately. After hanging up the phone, Rafa realized that he was in trouble. He had to find a place to hide the Fingerprint and he had to do it thoughtfully. He figured that if Jose took the '82 Corolla, he had take at least ten minutes before Jose would get there.  But if he took the Bus?  Then Rafa would be exceedingly screwed.

   Before he could come up with any reasonable ideas, Rafa was interrupted by ten pestering Arsene Wengers that were lured by his Fingerprint. Rafa panicked; 'Not again', he thought. Feeling exasperated, he fearlessly reached for his sock and deftly slapped every last one of them. Apparently this was an adequate deterrent--the discouraged critters began to scurry back toward the thicket, squealing with discontent. He exhaled with relief.  That's when he heard the Bus rolling up.  It was Jose.

----o0o---- 

   As he pulled up, he felt a sense of urgency. He had had to make an unscheduled stop at Wal-Mart to pick up a 12-pack of spoons, so he knew he was running late.  With a quick leap, Jose was out of the Bus and went charismatically jaunting toward Rafa's front door.  Meanwhile inside,  Rafa was panicking.  Not thinking, he tossed the Fingerprint into a box of oven mitts and then slid the box behind his grandfather clock. Rafa was stunned but at least the Fingerprint was concealed.  The doorbell rang.

   'Come in,' Rafa earnestly purred.  With a calculated push, Jose opened the door.  'Sorry for being late, but I was being chased by some clueless retard in a truck,' he lied.  'It's fine,' Rafa assured him. Jose took a seat right next to where Rafa had hidden the Fingerprint. Rafa belched trying unsuccessfully to hide his nervousness.  'Uhh, can I get you anything?' he blurted.  But Jose was distracted. Soon afterward, Rafa noticed a abrasive look on Jose's face. Jose slowly opened his mouth to speak.

   '...What's that smell?'

   Rafa felt a stabbing pain in his thigh when Jose asked this.  In a moment of disbelief, he realized that he had hidden the Fingerprint right by his oscillating fan. 'Wh-what?  I don't smell anything..!'  A lie.  A stupid look started to form on Jose's face. He turned to notice a box that seemed clearly out of place. 'Th-th-those are just my grandma's spoons from when she used to have pet marmots.  She, uh...dropped 'em by here earlier'. Jose nodded with fake acknowledgement...then, before Rafa could react, Jose deftly lunged toward the box and opened it.  The Fingerprint was plainly in view.

   Jose stared at Rafa for what what must've been eight microseconds. Rather abruptly, Rafa groped earnestly in Jose's direction, clearly desperate. Jose grabbed the Fingerprint and bolted for the door.  It was locked. Rafa let out a eccentric chuckle. 'If only you hadn't been so protective of that thing, none of this would have happened, Jose,' he rebuked. Rafa always had been a little dimwitted, so Jose knew that reconciliation was not an option; he needed to escape before Rafa did something crazy, like... start chucking paper clips at him or something. A few minutes later, he gripped his Fingerprint tightly and made a dash toward the window, diving headlong through the glass panels.

   Rafa looked on, blankly. 'What the hell?  That seemed excessive.  The other door was open, you know.' Silence from Jose. 'And to think, I varnished that window frame eight days ago...it never ends!' Suddenly he felt a tinge of concern for Jose. 'Oh.  You ..okay?' Still silence. Rafa walked over to the window and looked down. Jose was gone.

- Now it seems Benitez has stuck Ronaldo upfront, (probably because he hasn't got the same pace he used to have but still has the finishing quality), and will most likely offload Benzema and look at another winger to bring in.

Obviously it would be a dream come true if we matched or even surpassed our tally of last season but for some odd reason I don't believe we will. The main reason I believe this to be so is that Everton, Spurs and Liverpool all underperformed and I think they will be looking to make a statement this season. I can see us finishing in 9th but I could see us sneak up the table if we do win the games that we probably should be winning which sometimes we didn't last season however made it up by doing the famous double on Arsenal and Manchester United. As long as we have a decent cup run in either the FA or League Cup I'll be happy! Although would love it more if we won the FA Cup.


**Which player is going to be your star of the season and why?**

I'm not too sure on this one to be honest, I'd love to see Gomis start the season like how he ended last season with a good goal to game ratio but I'd like to also see Fabianski try and go for the golden glove again! One to watch out will almost certainly be Ayew and I do believe he can take the league by storm with the way that we play. Hopefully he'll get a few assists and goals this season!


**How do you think the team will line up?**


Gary has been toying with a few different formations against the bigger teams I believe we will play the 4-4-2 diamond formation and against some of the lower table teams we would probably play a 4-2-3-1 or even a 4-3-3. I'd love to see a team of 

------------------Fabianski-------------------

Naughton--Fernandez--Williams--Taylor--

I think we've learned that oil price can be very greatly manipulated by Saudi Arabia acting alone, i.e. not even coordinating with OPEC. Quite why they've chosen to dump oil on the markets for hardly any profit is debatable, but there are surely geopolitical forces at play - as opposed to purely economic forces.

Regarding the Iraq war oil angle - I'd say it was more a long term play. A lot of the world's oil reserves are controlled by powers that aren't especially US/west friendly, e.g. Russia, Iran. So to my mind Iraq emerged as a weak military target, as one of those big oil reserve nations/regions that could be made more US/west friendly. You can add in a few side arguments about WOMD, gassing of Kurds, destabilisation of neighbours such as Kuwait, etc. I think together those things created a nexus of situations that tipped the decision to go to war, but oil was likely the major factor (IMO).

I don't think defining error bounds for a chaotic system means much. That's my point really, the system is largely unpredictable when it comes to large scale events, and those large scale events dwarf all other effects when they do occur. 

Consider predictions in 2006/7 for steady growth for the coming years - we're only now getting back to those wealth levels, and many of the underlying dysfunction that caused the crash (most notably the the private debt to GDP ratio) are still with us.

I am personally doubtful we will reach 56 points again, doubles over arsenal and Manchester United won't come again in my lifetime.

His wife got very sick very quickly, and ended up needing a doctor early one morning, and a paramedic car (the ones that look a bit like police cars but say 'paramedic' across the back but are still stickered up etc) came, and some idiot interpreted to being a police car, and started telling everyone his house was raided, because child porn obviously. /s.
I listened to this story unfold over a few days, and in 48 hours they'd taken laptops/computers from the house, his wife had a heart attack because of it, his kids (who live in fucking New Zealand!) had disowned him and he was sacked. (None of this happened at all)

But I feel like if I had been given 3 months grace to plan ahead and get some advice and sort myself out before the plundering started I could have been in a better place now than just ending up back on benefits. It seems incredibly short sighted of them to prioritise minimal short term gains at the expense of making me destitute and reliant on benefits again, which will surely end up costing them more in the long run.

He's young so he can still improve but unfortunately for him he wont get any quicker. It's by far his biggest weakness, and he doesn't seem to realize how slow he is, so he sometimes gets himself into really stupid positions and has to dive in (I think Neville highlighted this on a few MNFs) which leads to him giving away pens and freekicks in dangerous positions. He really suffers with lapses in concentration as well, if a ball has to travel a long way in the air he sometimes loses focus and gets himself in a mess.

**.** Victor Moses was like a Bishop piece in a chess game, he kept slicing very good diagonal passes into the box. Hopefully he's gonna unsettle a few defenses this season.


**.** Suarez is an incredible talent, he was always making something out of nothing. Now I see why the front trio of Barca dominated everyone last season.


**.** Kenedy was a revelation, he was fearless in pursuing and challenging for the ball.


**.** Oscar has such an unassuming demeanor but he took one sublime free kick that showed those that didn't already know how good he is.


**.** Zouma, what a solid and immovable rock. I loved watching him track and neutralize any threats in the box. He's the future for sure.


**.** MatiÄ, y'all know who owns that position, no hype the man stood out every time he touched the ball.


**.** I watched Blackman, BegoviÄ and Courtois warm up and doing their drills, the other two are good but Courtois is on a whole other level. The twitchy reflexes of a guy that tall was amazing to see.

It's like pretending property rights are inefficient in all instances, even where transaction costs are low. 

*Though there are [actual examples,](http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/TragedyoftheCommons.html) and [it's silly](http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/ten-reallife-examples-of-the-tragedy-of-the-common.html) to suppose the tragedy of the commons is merely a thought experiment with no relevance here. 

&gt; The tragedy of the commons also arose in the savings and loan (S&amp;L) crisis. The federal government created this tragedy by forming the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC). The FSLIC relieved S&amp;L depositors of worry about their money by guaranteeing that it would use taxpayersâ money to repay them if an S&amp;L went broke. In effect, the government made the taxpayersâ money into a commons that S&amp;Ls and their depositors could exploit. S&amp;Ls had the incentive to make overly risky investments, and depositors did not have to care because they did not bear the cost. This, combined with faltering federal surveillance of the S&amp;Ls, led to widespread failures. The losses were âcommonizedâ among the nationâs taxpayers, with serious consequences to the federal budget (see savings and loan crisis).

&gt; Congestion on public roads that do not charge tolls is another example of a government-created tragedy of the commons. If roads were privately owned, owners would charge tolls and people would take the toll into account in deciding whether to use them. Owners of private roads would probably also engage in what is called peak-load pricing, charging higher prices during times of peak demand and lower prices at other times. But because governments own roads that they finance with tax dollars, they normally do not charge tolls. The government makes roads into a commons. The result is congestion.

He actually never told Fiorentina he would play another season there. Fiorentina paid Chelsea the fee to renew his loan, but he had a veto option. He held out for a while (not sure if for more money or just trying to make up his mind), and according to Fiorentina he missed the deadline (June 30) to use that option.

I don't think he's as big of an ego as a lot of people think, it seems to me that he has a bad agent with a loud mouth. He apparently loved being at Fiorentina for a while, but then they fired the manager that had said great things about him, and he was unsure if he'd have the same place in the squad under the new manager.",null,0,null,1438205720,null,0,false,0,ctksj3t,null,t3_3f2s7q,null,t1_ctksj3t,null,t1_ctkrlkv,null,null,null,1440165484,null,8,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,8,null

Call Shelter. I think you should (as in, I would like you to) get your full deposit back and be able to move out sooner than the end of August, but I am not a legal expert. There's something in flat rental tenancies about the landlord being obliged to let you live in the property 'in peace and quiet' and 'without harassment' and those could be the angles to work to your advantage. No idea about flat share agreements though, sorry. 

Similarly changing the locks and not letting you back in in a private flat share agreement is illegal, but in terms of practicalities, you probably aren't legally able to bust the door down if they do it, but you can sue them for unlawful eviction. Make sure you have a friend with a sofa lined up just in case, and a spare set of clothes etc kept somewhere other than the house.

Hardly anyone dies from head injuries - most bikers who get killed die from crush injuries to the torso or limbs - and a helmet won't necessarily protect you from head injuries. If you're concerned about safety it's more important to get training on assertiveness and avoiding dangerous situations.  

One final point - a helmet gives you a (very visible) place to mount an action camera, which according to some people can significantly improve the behaviour of motorists. I don't have a huge problem where I ride but you might find it worthwhile if you get a lot of punishment passes and other asshole manoeuvres where you live.

Why? People have trouble accepting killing people because they struggle to justify it to themselves. People in the military ask themselves, why was I there? Should I have been there, fighting those people in the first place? And the answer is likely no, since they've probably got a different view on foreign policy from their time spent in war zones.

But a police officers job is all about justifying what you've done, every single day. Nothing could be easier to justify to yourself than the actions taken in killing the man in this video.

~~Logitech Harmony Touch remote control (Â£80) - sealed never been opened,~~ ***removed from sale***

~~Blue SnowBall Omnidirectional (Â£45)- used occasionally but picked up a headset with mic and haven't used the snowball since. Still have the original box. ***Reserved for RedstoneOpenDoor pending meetup to trade items***~~ ***sold to RedstoneOpenDoor trade complete.***

Logitech G13 gamepad (Â£35) - purchased it secondhand but the seller never indicated it came from a smoking home as such it's sat in a the box, 

Saitek X55 Rhino (Â£120)- purchased to play Elite Dangerous but then GTA V came out and only used it maybe 3 times. Still have the original box and extra springs

Sennheiser HD 449 (Â£40)- sealed and never been opened.

Postage to be added on top of the above prices, and payment to be done via Bank Transfer, if you have any questions let me know! If anyone wanted to trade somethings let me know, ~~I'm looking for a K70 RGB with Cherry MX Browns or a Ducky Shine 3 MX Browns.~~

Prices can be negotiated these are just a ball park figure that I've taken from the lowest price on Amazon. 

I'm based in london so collection is an option. 

Thanks for looking!

I'm actually quite optimistic for this season - we have made some great signings, and I think Gary and Ash will lead the team into another solid season. I hope to see us qualify for Europa, but if circumstances deny us from it, I wouldn't be too disappointed. My prediction is 7th to 8th.

Our star player in my opinion will undoubtedly be Ashley Williams. He's been a rock in defense for us last season, and he's earned us points (I still remember that match vs Southampton). He knows what we're about, and I have no doubt in my mind that he'll be a solid, passionate leader for us. I'm also quite excited to see our new signing Andre Ayew (*Ayew* ready for him?) ^sorry , and I think Shelvey will improve on his composure and mental game even more from last season, which will make him deadly. His long shots are just pure sex.

null,false,bluebottled,null,null,null,"Yawn. This has been addressed many times before. The main rebuttals are:

1. NI in a united Ireland will not cost the same as NI in the UK. A massive chunk of the supposed cost of running NI is our contribution to UK institutions, like their armed forces, diplomatic services, etc. UK military spending will not go down without NI, they'll keep spending what they're spending now, but we won't be given the bill for it and told we need subsidies to pay it.
2. Revenue from NI in a united Ireland will not be the same as revenue from NI in the UK. Switching over to the same tax regime as the south will probably lower it at first, but a united Ireland will be able to do what the UK can't: make growing our economy its top priority.
3. The main selling point for reunification, as above, is economic growth. These north-south 'comparisons' are only in favour of the UK if they're extremely narrow. [NI is the poorest part of Ireland](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/7/77/Gross_domestic_product_%28GDP%29_per_inhabitant%2C_in_purchasing_power_standard_%28PPS%29%2C_by_NUTS_3_regions%2C_2011_%281%29_%28%25_of_the_EU-28_average%2C_EU-28_%3D_100%29_RYB14.png), despite being more densely populated than most of the island. We underperform in the UK because being in the UK does not work for us economically. We won't reach parity with the south overnight, it'll probably take at least a decade in a united Ireland, but it'll never happen in the UK. That is to say, that where we're a permanent and continuous drain on UK finances, the drain on a united Ireland would be front-loaded and most of the deficit would likely be wiped out after a decade.
4. The comparison is being made at a time of economic weakness for the south. Before the global economy imploded it was running a budget surplus and was the fastest growing economy in Europe. 6/7 years later and it is once again the fastest growing economy in Europe (and again we're missing out). Reunification is decades away, the south will most likely be in surplus by the time the demographics of the north have shifted enough for a vote to be winnable. Probably not enough of one to completely wipe out our deficit, but enough to make borrowing to make up the shortfall until we become self-sufficient a credible and realistic plan.
5. 'The NHS' is a straw man argument. Both nationalists and unionists, and everyone else in the north would want to keep it. There's probably strong support for an NHS-like system in the south too. There is no way we'd lose it. At worst we'd run a separate system, at best we'd set up a single NHS-like system for the whole island.",null,0,null,1438211930,null,0,false,0,ctkwhlb,null,t3_3f35kh,null,t1_ctkwhlb,null,t3_3f35kh,null,null,null,1440167414,null,20,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,20,null

null,false,MrFlabulous,,Glorious People's Republic Of Asbostan,null,"Putting on my science hat here, and believe me it is a science hat. For 10+ years I have worked in diabetes and obesity research for a couple of Big Pharmas and the MRC. Most of my background is in the physiological side of things (adipose browning, beta-cell apoptosis etc.) but also with a fair chunk looking at the CNS side of things: the brain's response to food. And it is with some measure of authority when I say this:

Food is indeed addictive.

It's complicated, but the hypothalamus displays alarming plasticity (i.e. programmability) when subjected to various stimuli. However, many different stimuli have similar effects, for example nicotine, heroin, alcohol and *ta dah* food. There is a huge drive based on our origins (most mammals in fact) as many of the things that cause the dopamine ""feel-good"" response do so because they are triggering one of our most basic survival rewards. Our ancestors found survival so tough that their brains would release rewarding dopamine to encourage those behaviours to continue. Examples:

Brain: ""Well done for having sex and making babies, that's the way to ensure survival of the species! Have some dopamine.""

Body: *Pleasure intensifies*

Brain: ""That was some good food right there. Better than the usual nuts and tree bark. Especially good was that piece of fat from that animal's belly. Today you get some extra dopamine!""

Body: *Pleasure intensifies*

Essentially certain foods release more dopamine, in the same way that many drugs do as well. And like many neurophysiological stimuli, a tolerance is reached, causing the brain to seek higher rewards. As I alluded to earlier this is not limited to humans, it's why you also see fat dogs and cats.

However another thing that causes dopamine release is exercise: having the ability to respond to a fight/flight reflex is very important, so the brain rewards you when you do some exercise as well. So yeah, anyone can do it, it's just a case of finding the best method. I can no longer run: years of rugby and cricket have left me with no knees. Swimming is good, as the knees don't have to support my impressive bulk. But also: I'm really lazy.

There's a whole lot of stuff I could dig out for you on the addiction side of things, it's heavy going though but you can often find decent layman explanations in New Scientist. Several academic groups around the UK do a lot of work on this side of things in fact, and there is some excellent research being done to see if LSD therapy can help fight obesity in the same way that we think it helps alcoholics.

&gt; All of us Labour members who have been out campaigning recently will have heard it. You knock on the door and someone answers and says: âWe only ever see you at election time â you just want one thingâ.

&gt; It rarely does justice to years of hard work by the local MP and councillors. But it poses a challenge that Labour has to meet if it is to win power again.

&gt; Letâs be frank. Too many voters think Labour is no longer a movement of people across the country committed to social justice, but a machine that only kicks into gear at election time. Difficult though it is to accept, for millions who share our values, Labour is no longer seen as their voice for change or the vehicle for delivering it. Since Keir Hardieâs time we have fought the poverty, inequality and injustices that hold back too many.

&gt; We sought office not just to change governments but to change lives.

&gt; * The Minimum Wage

&gt; * The NHS

&gt; * Devolution

&gt; * Equity Law

&gt; Each a testament to how, at our best, we have been a force for good, changing Britain for the better.

&gt; This passion for social justice still beats strong within our members today. And as we watch this Tory government dismantle the welfare state, destroy the lives of our young people and demoralize the public sector, never more has Britain needed the fire for change and faith in an alternative.

&gt; I am standing to be Deputy leader of the Labour party to help restore that fire and faith in our party. This is about more than 650 people in Westminster â Labour has always been able to achieve change from the grassroots up, not just on the green benches of parliament. Too many people now see politics as an elite sport, for the few not the many. That means we miss out on their ideas and actions as they get put off taking part. I want to change that. Our members are our best asset. They are people who believe fairness, prosperity and opportunity is open to all, not just those with the money or means to buy success. And people who are willing to stand up and defend this principle in their own communities.

&gt; Since the election 30,000 people have joined Labour â if we ignore them until an election comes round, we do them and the cause we all serve, a dis-service But that doesnât mean treating every day like polling day. To harness their passion for social justice we have to offer them more than a leaflet round or a three hour procedures committee.

&gt; I want to tap into the energy, enthusiasm and experience of every man and woman who wants to speak up for a different kind of Britain. Just because you join a political party, it doesnât mean you stop campaigning for change. So I want us to get back to our roots in fighting injustice. Whether tackling legal loan sharks or taking on the twitter trolls my track record shows I know how to work with people across Britain to take on those who exploit or harass the vulnerable. Now Iâm standing to be Labourâs deputy leader to ensure Labour is once again a movement and not a machine.

&gt; Labour has to renew and rediscover its voice in every community across our country. Together we can again be a force for good for Britain.",null,0,null,1438212362,null,0,false,0,ctkwqyo,null,t3_3f1b6p,null,t1_ctkwqyo,null,t1_ctkw2bz,null,null,null,1440167537,null,2,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,2,null

With regard to Doctor Who, I have seen every episode since Rose, and again, now I know which episodes I generally skip over for re-watches. But I tried them all and found out which ones I liked and which ones I didn't. Coincidentally, the ones I skip most are Matt Smith's, but only because I had given them a try first and decided ""yeah, I can pass on this one next time"".

So I would say give them all a try, maybe you'll be pleasantly surprised by some stories like I was. And you don't have to like them all; I skip the majority of Series 6 when I re-watch.

You direct manager is setting ridiculous requirements in terms of the webcam, and is causing stress which would appear to be at a dangerous level for somebody who is pregnant.

For a claim of constructive dismissal to be successful the burden of proof is on yourself, and you would have to be able to demonstrate that the actions of your employer were such that there is effectively a breach of contract that goes to the root of it, giving you a right to resign and claim that you were effectively dismissed  (Western Excavating v Sharp).

ACAS will be able to advise you further, but an unfair dismissal claim can cost a company tens of thousands, and I would imagine just the threat of a justified claim would be enough to have them put the manager in his place to protect the company and resolve the situation.

I'll be honest, I might be blasphemous here, but I've actually had few problems with Arsenal fans.  Most of them are actually level-headed and realize that they are not good enough to win the league.  It could just be that there is a high variance of the attitude of Arsenal fans, but they are far more tolerable than Man U fans.

And the bit about Chelsea fans is how the atmosphere is so dull in the last two friendlies I've been to in D.C.  Two years ago was the worst, against Roma, when Schwarzer made a howler that gave Roma the lead, the fans booed him and chanted, ""We want Cech.""

The Union has it's problems, but there is no reason to scrap it when we can have great influence in changing it for the better.

In terms of it conflicting with local and community politics..I don't really see how it does, since the issues concerning each are totally different. I'd say that community politics, though great, has it's limits when large scale issues need to be discussed, issues which aren't only local, where there needs to be a transnational unanimous decision. (Eg on climate change, nuclear disarmament, peace and prosperity, human rights). 

""But isn't that the purpose of the UN?"" Well yes, but there are also regional issues, like the illegal migrant crisis, transatlantic trade agreements, and more positive stuff like investment and sustainable development, even fishing quotas.


In terms of the economy I wrote this a few days ago:

""Yes, Europe is not perfect, neither is it intrinsically good (eg see the blackmail of greece to implement harsh austerity measures and give up part of their fiscal sovereignty), but all (almost?) economical issues are limited to the eurozone, not Europe as a whole (monetary union without fiscal union is unsustainable, etc). For the UK, the net contribution to the economy due to free trade and migration is probably massive.""

1) Is fine.

2) While it does occur before The End of Time, he doesn't remember it at all, so he won't have been able to put any special plans in motion for changing it (we also saw pretty much everything that happened, so there wasn't really much chance to).

3) It's specifically mentioned ""Their plans have already failed"", so we know TDOTD is set after TEOT in Gallifrey's timeline. This makes sense as in TDOTD, they're under their final attack (that lasts until they get banished), while they're not in TEOT.

That would have taken massive coincidental timing to be plausible though. It would have had to have happened in the minute between The Time Lords came through and Gallifrey followed, and we know the massive bombarding and explosions started up more than a minute before. Unless Rassilon was in a very quiet area where it couldn't have been noticed (unlikely as he was in the main city), we would have noticed it as we saw him just before he came through (as well as several minutes before that).

null,false,Artoo_Detoo,RC,china,null,"Barcelona is just unique in how much of a bunch of assholes their organization can be.  Every big team has asshole fans and a couple of asshole players, but Barcelona as an organization is actually terrible.  They truly believe that the world cannot be happy unless Barcelona wins, and every time Barcelona loses, the world is sad.

1. Samuel Eto'o became a Chelsea player but in 2005 when they lost to Chelsea he called the Chelsea players and managers ugly when they were celebrating.

2. The team is full of pussies who surround the referee to try to influence his decisions.  Drogba's red card in 2005, Del Horno's red card in 2006, Fabregas' dive in 2012, heck I was actually even mad when van Persie got sent off for shooting after the whistle, it was just so infuriating.  A smaller thing that people don't realize, but Cech received a yellow card in the epic second leg in 2012, but for all the wrong reasons.  He received it for time wasting, but every time the ball went out for a goal kick, the Barcelona ball boy would immediately throw a ball at Cech to try to make him restart quicker.  Cech didn't do any excessive time wasting, all he would do would go after the ball that went out since he could reach it and restart, but the Barcelona players bitched enough for him to get a caution.  Obviously would never have happened at Stamford Bridge.

3. When Inter Milan beat Barcelona, the groundscrew even turned on the sprinklers to try to spoiler their party.  Yes, even the groundscrew are getting into being assholes.  And then when Mourinho tried to celebrate in front of his own fans, Victor Valdes for god knows why with his bitchy face tried to stop him from doing so.  Barcelona fans even refuse to acknowledge this, they actually think Mourinho tried to taunt Barcelona fans even though the youtube video clearly shows all the officials trying to stop Valdes from further bitching.

4. The entire team tapped up Fabregas and didn't even bother to act like they did anything wrong.  It was embarrassing how they put a Barcelona shirt on Fabregas when he was still an Arsenal player.  Again, I might be blasphemous here, but I was enraged by how shitty their attitude was.  Sure I was happy Fabregas was leaving England, but at the same time, I could not bear watching those shitty Barcelona players being happy.

5. Then they tried to blame it all on Fabregas when they sold him that he didn't do enough, even his goodbye message on their website basically slammed him for it.  Also that by buying Fabregas they basically fucked themselves because they sold Thiago Alcantara to Bayern.  Uh, hello, you guys were the fuckers who tapped up Fabregas and used every shady method to get him, it's your own fault he didn't pan out the way you wanted him to.

6. I don't remember who in their organization, maybe their president said that Cristiano Ronaldo was only the 12th best player in the world, because the best 11 are all Barcelona players.  Also when they lost against Chelsea in 2012 they cried injustice and that it was a sad day for football, basic bullshit you wouldn't hear presidents of other teams say in general.

I know I could think of a ton more examples but I've ranted enough.

The stripped bad scene of the doctor realising he is about to die as he wont allow wilf to do so is epically beautiful because it just showcases to the two incredible actors with incredibly moving writing without anything big like special effects or loud music. Then the goodbyes that last a good 10 minutes are heartbreaking completely necessary as a viewer because everyone wants to see a proper goodbye but also because we were losing Russell t Davies so felt symbolic for that goodbye as well.

His passing range consistently proves an asset and the cover provided by the more defensive-minded Jack Cork allows Jonjo more freedom to play attacking football. Together with Sigurdsson, the pairâs potentially a menace to any team. 

**How do you think the team will line up?**

I expect Tabanou to grow into the squad through the season. Iâd also like to see us play a 4-4-2 diamond with Ayew and Gomis up top. Though this is how I think weâll line up regularly: http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=8635

But it's chicken and the egg, isn't it?  We don't spend much money because we don't make much, but we won't make much unless we spend enough to get better results on the pitch.

Football is a financial game, pure and simple.  You can't seriously compete (at least not for more than 3-4 years) unless you spend heavily in transfers and buy world class talent.

The Bale transfer window was a huge statement of intent by the club, that they were now ready to buy success.  That it didn't work out isn't the fault of the intent, it's the fault of specific decisions and financially backing a coach whose appointment was a dubious idea in the first place.  It was still the right idea.

The club has dropped out of the serious top 4 conversation for now not because they've spent too much, but spent too little.  Had we pulled the trigger on numerous near-misses in recent years like Moutinho, we'd arguably not be so far away from the pack again.

And the idea that ""we just can't afford it"" is bullshit.  Every other team in the EPL goes into debt, and yet we make a tidy profit.  I'm sure no fans would actually care if we were 100m in debt and yet finished 3rd, pipping Arsenal to the post.

null,false,Helpopotamus,lfc87,,null,"With their thin squad and given how they burned out after January last year without the added burden European football I can't see Southampton being at all relevant in this discussion. 

I'll be highly surprised if they finish in the top ten. Everton, Swansea, Newcastle etc have all had seasons like they had, got Europa and been in a bottom half struggle the following year because of it. 

Everton will probably do pretty well, they're my favourites for 6th. I think they were truly not ready for European games and now that they don't have that, their focus and energy will be back to what it was the season before last. I think they could end up finishing above Spurs. 

We're definitely stronger than Spurs having watched both of our seasons due to my housemate being a fan of them. They were shite, and scraped many lucky escapes from awful performances. They've barely improved with their midfield pairing of Mason and Bentaleb being very poor. I rate Bentaleb highly for the future, but he isn't all that yet, and Mason is bang average. 

I think if they don't improve that area or buy someone to take some pressure of Kane they could be actually in for a shit year. Kane runs the risk of fizzling out then where do the goals come from? Even with Kane, Eriksen and Lloris they were poor for large parts of last season, and you have to ask where will they be if they perform like that again and a magical Kane winner isn't there to save them this year.

We've addressed our key issues upfront (hopefully), and solidified a position we were very weak in last year with a class replacement at fullback. Another thing for me is I love Gerrard to bits, but we played much better without him and his farewell tour forfeited the challenge for fourth place and is what let Spurs overtake us in the first place.

I still think we'll be depending on one of the top four to have a weak season to dislodge them, but I think we are the best bet and can give them a proper run if our signings do kick on. 

Predictions for the teams listed.

Liverpool: 

 - 4th if we perform well and with a bit of luck.

 or
 - 5th 

Spurs: 

 - 7th. If they add some better players I'll upgrade them, but I'm not convinced by them at all currently.

or 

 - 6th. If they add players and Everton don't live up to my expectations.

Everton:

 - 6th: Aforementioned lack of Europe will see them leap up the table in my opinion. Back to playing close to how they did when they almost got top four.

Fact is they still ran with public sector cuts at the heart of their campaign. People don't think about economics in logical ways, otherwise they'd know it's normal for countries to run deficits. Therefore, if you say we can have austerity and it will be over by 2019 as the Tories did, people will take that option over Labour's muddled plan on the economy.

*Daytime kick-off* 

Get off at Lime Street. Get a cab to my brothers and spend an hour or two with him.

Walk down Belmont Rd/Walton Breck Rd to the ground.

Immediately go to one of the stewards outside The Centenary Stand and get a printout off my card. This is an important part of my ritual and one of the stewards (Elaine) knows this. She has printed off my tickets details for some great wins.

Buy an âAnfield burgerâ (two quarter pounders with cheese) and a bottle of coke from one of the vans.

Take the cap off my bottle of Coke, and put it in my pocket, before going to the turnstile. 

Enter the ground exactly half an hour before kick-off, or as near as dammit.
 
After going through the turnstile, go directly to the bogs and put the cap back on my bottle, and then have a pee.

Go to my seat. 

Fold up the print out from my card and put it in my card wallet (I keep all the print outs in there and it is becoming rather bulky). 

Stand up when the teams are announced and cheer as each Liverpool player is announced.

When the strains of Youâll Never Walk Alone start, Hold my scarf over my head and sing.

When the song ends, shake my fist and say âCome on you mighty redsâ.

After the match go to the Chinese chippy and either celebrate or commiserate with chips, meat pie and gravy. 

Walk to Breck Rd and either catch a bus or a cab to Lime Street and get my train home.

Jump a cab at the station to my local pub and either celebrate or commiserate by getting pissed.

Evening matches differ slightly due to travel arrangements, *but once I am at the ground I always follow this ritual.*

The Nobel peace prize was given to the EU back in 2012 because we are living in the longest period of unity within Europe EVER. We are wealthy, healthy and a peaceful group of nations that is struggling to create a balance between Russia geographically and American spheres of influence.

A symptom of this peace can be seen by the refugees from war torn countries seeking a life in Europe, it would be a natural choice considering the current situation in most countries where political and personal strife are daily. We were greatly affected by the US economical crash to which was the precursor to the Euro zone crisis. We also have influence in the former communist eastern bloc, from capitalisation, protection of democracy and again Peace to countries wanting to join to join the EU in not short road but a worthwhile use of EU taxpayers money.

For Britain's place in this union we played a key part in the making of the EU. Churchill once was quoted as to say in Zurich in 1946 'There is a remedy which ... would in a few years make all Europe ... free and ... happy. It is to re-create the European family, or as much of it as we can, and to provide it with a structure under which it can dwell in peace, in safety and in freedom. We must build a kind of United States of Europe.â He opposed the UK joining this union because at the time we still in the mist of empire.

I get where your coming from on the close government arguement but we have councillors, we have MPs and we have MEPs. The fact the population of the UK have plenty of representation at all levels (even if they need reform). but to not to have a voice in Europe is a very bad choice for Democracy and freedoms within the UK and very bad for the future of the UK Economy, its society and our innovations.

I agree that we should be thinking carefully about universally issuing something like a taser, a device that while provably effective does have it's own issues, but given one of the key benefits is that it allows the police to keep a safer distance when using it I don't think it'd be too much of a stretch to say these police would have been at less risk if they had access to a taser.

My worry with universally issuing tasers is that they will become the restraint/comply citizen tool of first choice since they are so effective.  I know currently they're treated much like firearms and every use has to be justified etc. but wonder if wider use will result in an easing off of current policies.

British cops seem to have a pretty good culture of not being excessive in their application of force though (yes the odd case says otherwise I know) which has to count for something, if it stays clipped to a belt for years without being used until a job like this comes in then it probably should be on every belt.

I think this will be a fine season for us. The goal is Europe and I think it is attainable. Some of the moves perennial mid-table clubs like Palace have been making look to push us more than we have been before. I look for us to compete better with the top four this year than last. Finishing between 9th and 5th (5th might be too optimistic but thats what the pre-season is for)

**Star Player**

I think Ki may be our most important player because of how versatile he has proved but I think Gylfi comes up big again this year. Keep an eye on Routledge as the addition of Ayew and Monterro still playing on the left might give him more space to create goals. He's a little old to be having a ""breakout season"", but I have a feeling this might be his best year yet (I could be very very wrong though)

If you only watch the beginning then you are only seeing the starting point of their character arcs and missing the fact they are growing and changing over the course of the season. 

Part of your difficulty adjusting may be that you went from always having the next episode there to having to wait each week.

That said, I love the fact that the show was able to slow down and take its time with acting, dialog and character development in this last season which made it one of my favorites. I won't disagree that the pace has changed a bit but I personally think it is for the better. 

As far as season 8 overall, I would say there were 2 episodes I really disliked, 1 I thought was barely passable, 2 that are in my all time favorites now, and the rest were improvements over most of season 6&amp;7. It had its weak points and NuWho has still has yet to pull off a really great statisfying finale but it was probably slightly better than Tennant's first season (that also had 2 really bad episodes).

Really, it depends on what you want from the show. Personally I hated the way they made nonsensical choices with the characters and plots in season 6 and if you liked that then we might have different taste. Regardless, I think it's silly to discount the whole story of season 8 based on its starting point. The Doctor in *Last Christmas* has changed a lot from the Doctor in *Into the Dalek*. It's surprising to me how many here people seem to have judged the entire character of Capaldi's Doc based on his self doubt and confusion in the wake of changing his personal history in *Day of the Doctor* and then being stuck in a war for 900 years before living past the point he thought he was going to die for good in *Time of the Doctor.""

Was it to support your local club? Was it to support the club that your dad did?

Or was it merely to chose to be a part of an elite side who you have no other tangible links to whatsoever?

I don't really blame young lads/kids for picking up City now to be honest, we're one of the biggest sides in the country and play some fantastic football.

Not everyone has the same outlook on the game as I do, and that's fine. But they shouldn't pretend to either, they shouldn't pretend that their support is no different to someone whose motives for supporting this club were very different.

I just worry about us losing our character and becoming another soulless generic elite club with hoards of shallow gloryhunting fans (not all new fans are gloryhunters of course as I've just touched upon, but there's a very specific subset who clearly are only in it for the reflective glory).

I worry about our ticket prices and the gentrification of our match going crowd, the pricing out of longstanding blues who've made this club what it is.

The rest is all fluff really. The only real resentment comes in when new fans simply here for the glory try and equate their support of City to someone whose motives for doing so were very, very different. When those people ridicule concerns over ticket prices (that a new demand for tickets from people like them has brought about) and the harm it does to our fanbase.

The real frustration and resentment comes from concerns over the core identity of the club. If City had reasonable pricing and were inclusive, then we could extend the North Stand this season and fill it entirely with new and old fans alike. The atmosphere would improve rather than decline, and the relationship between the club and the supporters would be in a much healthier place.

What's frustrating is that we're becoming exclusive. That our match going crowd and character is being lost because ticket prices are increasing year on year.

We're slowly becoming everything we used to deride and detest in the shape of United. We used to pride ourselves on not being like United from a club/supporter perspective, sure, we might have been shite, but we weren't the corporate money grabbing whore that United were. We were Manchester's own, and in spite of our failings on the pitch, at least we weren't the type of club that was synonmous with the 'prawn sandwich brigade' and club sponsored noodles for example.

Now, we have the success but we have all the bad stuff too. All things we used to deride about United are now part and parcel of our club. The supporters increasingly seem like an afterthought to the club, and corporate is just a big a part of this club as it is of United's.

It's easy to say that's the way the game's gone, and it's true to an extent, but I didn't think City would so fully embrace the bad stuff. And it truly pains me that we have.

It's my biggest issue with City at present. Particularly the regular ticket price increases and all the harm that does to the supporters, and ultimately, the soul of the club.

If you're a new fan and you stand side by side with the core support and the issues that matter most to them, then you'll be welcomed with open arms by any City supporter.",null,0,null,1438220894,null,0,false,0,ctl1tzq,null,t3_3f3imi,null,t1_ctl1tzq,null,t1_ctkzvvz,null,null,null,1440169998,null,15,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,15,null

The HSE, if it operated at UK scale, would probably kill the 4,900 person population of Crumlin, County Antrim, each year. If you assumed absolute proportionality, a person in Northern Ireland would have to consider that overcrowding in the NHS could have accounted for 14 deaths last year. If they got HSE standards overnight, that could become 138.

Thats the thing Skunkd, his numbers are bizarre.

&gt; The HSE, if it operated at UK scale,..

What? Just what has that got to do with a United Ireland? We are talking about an extra 1.5 Million not an extra 64 million people. In any case it doesn't make Sense the HSE would have a much larger Tax base from which it would be funded.

&gt;  If you assumed absolute proportionality a person in Northern Ireland....

Umm...No we won't. Why would we base it on a UK wide figure. Just Because something has numbers in it doesn't make it correct.

1. Weed can be psychologically addictive. You can still get mental withdrawal symptoms if you let it become habit, but it won't make the sufferer ill like hard drug withdrawal will. However, being ""addicted"" to weed isn't going to ruin your life like being addicted to other stuff. 

Rehab just for weed is too extreme. People who are addicted and stop smoking weed might be moody for a week or two, but weed addiction isn't a massive problem, however it's worth being aware of it.
2. Being less harmful than alcohol means diddly squat and should never be used as an indicator of how good something is. This kid is 14, consuming any sort of mind-altering drug could potentially have negative effects on brain development that isn't an issue when you're an adult.

null,false,G_Thirty,BnW,,null,"I am someone from the states who became a fan in the 11/12 season. I had never watched a professional level soccer match of any kind but I kept seeing Wayne Rooney's face everywhere and it really annoyed me for some reason. I was in high school and one day after class I went to espn's website and the top headline was the Manchester Derby. I didn't have anything to do so I checked it out and watch City beat United 6-1 and before that the only opinion I had on the premier league or soccer at all was that i didn't like ManU and Lionel Messi was amazing. I just saw that game and chose to be a City fan, I had no idea about City's history or their recent influx in money. 




That season and the next I was not a big fan of the sport still but I watched games here and there, probably about 5 or 6 a season. City was more of just my team in soccer if someone really asked me about it because I was not extremely interested in the sport still. But starting with the 13/14 season and through the last I got really hooked into the sport and have watched about every City game since. 




I did not become a fan because City just got rich because I had no idea what the club's history was when I became a fan. I would never claim to be a City fan since birth or anything but when I get criticized for becoming a City fan so recently I just don't understand it. I JUST started watching soccer and I didn't just choose the most recent Premier League winner because I liked them at the start of that season. Am I not allowed to be a fan of any team just because I am from a different country and have no connections to the club? No one in my family has ever watched soccer and I love it so I wasn't going to just not be a fan of any team. Am I only allowed to become a United/Chelsea/Barcelona/Arsenal/Madrid fan just because I'm from the states? 




I get that I will never be City's biggest fan in the world but I watch every game I can, I support the club in wins and losses, and even if we were to be relegated next season I would never changed clubs. I know you weren't really saying anything against what I was saying I just figured I would reply with my situation. I understand your points because I am someone who is the same type of fan as you but for my hometown's sports teams over here in America (Hornets, Panthers).

He seems like a level headed chap, and though I don't think we'll keep hold of him in the near future, I'd like to think he can stay and hone his craft with us a while longer. 

If you sign him, you're getting a proper boss player.

IMO, S8 has some of the deepest, strongest character work -- in terms of these people actually picking themselves up and *going* somewhere in their discoveries and understanding about themselves and each other -- that I've seen in DW (and I've been watching since the sixties).  S8 is outstanding in part because it's *not* like the rest of NewWho, or BG; the writers and cast took the whole series to let these two leads re-build themselves from the ground up, leaning on each other, quarreling with each other, learning to trust each other.  Because it's this kind of large arc emotionally and psychologically, it's not the breakneck pace of some of the earlier NewWho work, and it helps to come back to it when you've seen it once, and know how the stories work out.  That way you can concentrate on the slower unfolding of character, which is the real meat of the series in my view.  I recommend watching the rest of S8, and then giving it a re-watch after a couple of weeks, and see if your feeling about it changes.  If not, no problem -- S9 is coming up fast, and promises to be revved up higher now that the basic construction work is done.

Trippier was the biggest surprise for me. I never had really seen him play for Burnley but I'm really impressed. His defending looks solid, he seems to something of a leader in the backfield, and THOSE crosses. He is definitely going to challenge Kyle Walker for right back.

I see why Pochettino rates Winks and Alli so highly. They both look ready for first team. Wimmer and Joshua Onomah looked decent as well although I think Wimmer is more of a back up and Onomah should probably get loaned to a premiere league team like Carroll was to Swansea.

The biggest takeaway from this game is that we need to buy another striker. Shaq Coulthirst didn't impress me and he doesn't seem like he can be Kane's backup. We need someone else to be Kane's backup. I'd be down with Berahino except the price seems like it is going to be an issue.

Pick one, unfortunately.

As a northener who now lives down in the big smog I highly suggest you follow the chaps advice above and get work lined up first then come down. The rental market here is crazy fast, stuff comes up and goes off all the time so if you've a job secured and a known budget you can know what to look for and where.

Rental down here is very variable. A decent 1 bed flat out somewhere east eg Dartford area will set you back 700-800pcm. Somewhere semi central and near a tube station, for no less than 1200pcm you'll get a mouldy ruined bedroom in a house that shares 6 other bedrooms to a bathroom and kitchen full of people who will use all the hot water before you get up, eat all your cornflakes, and accept your amazon deliveries and never tell you, ran by an arsehole landlord who has 1000 people like you lined up so if you're not happy, tara mate!

Ok, I've embellished that inner city bedsit a bit... :) But seriously, everyone will tell you London rents are notoriously expensive and they're not lying.

Fuck if I hear another person assume Man U makes it into the top 4, I'll scream.  They're not even in the Champions League yet for Christ's sake.  They're in the playoffs.  Big difference.

The only thing I have to say is compared to Shaw situation when Man U paid 30 million and 100k in wages, with hindsight I thought it wasn't worth it.  Talks are we are going to triple Stones wages to 100k too.  The problem is no matter how much potential, it is really hard to tell whether a young player will meet his potential.  With just half season is way too much of a risk.

Look at El shaarawy, or chalobah who everyone was dead cert will make it or many many young superstars that doesn't make it.

I rather we spend more later when we are more sure than risk it now.  Considering it seems likely Everton would need an obscene price, it couldn't be that much more to get him later.

As someone who lived in the UK, moved to the US, ""cut the cord"", and recently visited my parents back home and watched a lot of stuff VOD ... here are my thoughts:

 1. Timezones: This is kind of true, I guess. I'm not sure how relevant it is, for live events they are shown at the same time for non-live it makes it used to be easier to say ""blah is on a 9"" (in the time before DVRs).
 2. EPG: This is misleading at best. Yeh, each local cable station is free to number the channels differently ... but you are also dealing with 30+ channels with a basic cable package. And even if you don't have a DVR, live like an amish why don't you, it's possible to select ""nbc"" on your TV. Whoever wrote ""This positioning is hugely important as the process of finding channels and programmes is part of a national ritual"" feel free to punch yourself in the face.
 3. ADS: Yeh, we get a lot more ads. Yeh, it's worse. But we do have ""linear"" channels without ads, and after having no ads it's still annoying to watch ""linear"" ITV.
 4. UK it's ""free"": In the UK you pay the TV licensing fee, that's about the same as a basic cable package over here ... esp. when you factor in that everyone has to pay it (and will continue to even if you ""cut the cord""). The people in the US who are ""free"" buy a TV and that's it.
 5. National vs. local: I think this is mostly delusional. The uk has 65m people in it and the US about 320m, so if someone has 50% of the UK or 10% of the US they are doing the same. Also, almost all the players are monopolies (even the smallest).
 6. PAL vs. NTSC: Lol, what decade is this? 720/1080 aren't using either of those, and the US has HD cable. Nobody I've heard of has moved for better quality.
 7. netflix sucks in UK: Yeh, mostly. I heard similar for amazon prime streaming. Saying nobody is doing X in the UK because X sucks here atm., isn't such a great argument though.
 8. VOD magically isn't: Now TV/BBC player/ITV player/etc. ... these are VOD services. They work the same as HBO go vs. regular HBO, dito. ESPN, etc. etc. I'm not sure if the author is confused about how the BBC is funded or confused about some difference with ITV player.

Obviously being shunted by Jose, Salah took the viable option out and went Fiorentina. Playing good at Fiorentina, Salah got his options increased as a result and with the man who signed him in first place leaving Fiorentina he looked for a way out. Now Chelsea and Fiorentina both expected him to renew the contract hence the leeway in Cuadrados deal but Salah could always veto the loan.

Information is a much more complex issue than simply people technically having access.

There's too much information about for anyone to interpret so what happens is we rely heavily on people to filter it for us - generally journalists and politicians. When these individuals are dependent upon wealthy plutocrats who take an active interest in controlling the message we receive a distorted perpective on reality.

For example take the widely distributed idea of ""maxxing the nation's credit card."" This is complete economic nonsense. You can't max out your credit if you can print money. The downside to printing money is that interest rates may rise but we're already underwater on interest rates - they're currently trying to go below zero and it's only macroeconomic intervention that prevents this from happening. QE for example didn't do anything to raise interest rates - we printed Â£375 billion ([source](http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetarypolicy/Pages/qe/qe_faqs.aspx)) and interest rates are still rock bottom.

Yet this line has been repeated over and over so often that it is how most British people see the economy.

null,false,RichardsDressingGown,null,null,null,"#Barcelona is just unique in how much of a bunch of assholes their organization can be.  Every big team has asshole fans and a couple of asshole players, but Barcelona as an organization is actually terrible.  They truly believe that the world cannot be happy unless Barcelona wins, and every time Barcelona loses, the world is sad.

Baseless. This is like starting a conversation with ""I saw their fans on twitter say""

#1. Samuel Eto'o became a Chelsea player but in 2005 when they lost to Chelsea he called the Chelsea players and managers ugly when they were celebrating.

Then hate a man who scored a hatrick against Manchester United in the PL, and Champions League heart breakers against Arsenal and Manchester United. He is not their spokesman. He also said he would rather sell peanuts in Cameroon then play for a shitty team like Chelsea.

#2. The team is full of pussies who surround the referee to try to influence his decisions.  Drogba's red card in 2005, Del Horno's red card in 2006, Fabregas' dive in 2012, heck I was actually even mad when van Persie got sent off for shooting after the whistle, it was just so infuriating.  A smaller thing that people don't realize, but Cech received a yellow card in the epic second leg in 2012, but for all the wrong reasons.  He received it for time wasting, but every time the ball went out for a goal kick, the Barcelona ball boy would immediately throw a ball at Cech to try to make him restart quicker.  Cech didn't do any excessive time wasting, all he would do would go after the ball that went out since he could reach it and restart, but the Barcelona players bitched enough for him to get a caution.  Obviously would never have happened at Stamford Bridge.

So like when Oscar dived and the Chelsea team surrounded the referee to get Zlatan sent off?

Also, a Chelsea fan should never ever get mad at an Arsenal player being sent off, it is always glorious.

# 3. When Inter Milan beat Barcelona, the groundscrew even turned on the sprinklers to try to spoiler their party.  Yes, even the groundscrew are getting into being assholes.  And then when Mourinho tried to celebrate in front of his own fans, Victor Valdes for god knows why with his bitchy face tried to stop him from doing so.  Barcelona fans even refuse to acknowledge this, they actually think Mourinho tried to taunt Barcelona fans even though the youtube video clearly shows all the officials trying to stop Valdes from further bitching.

Jose has a bitter relationship with Barca, he is a spurned lover, he loved Barca and they picked Guardiola over him. Be grateful they did, because he has ended up back at Chelsea and his love for Barca is gone. This is great for us. 

#4. The entire team tapped up Fabregas and didn't even bother to act like they did anything wrong.  It was embarrassing how they put a Barcelona shirt on Fabregas when he was still an Arsenal player.  Again, I might be blasphemous here, but I was enraged by how shitty their attitude was.  Sure I was happy Fabregas was leaving England, but at the same time, I could not bear watching those shitty Barcelona players being happy.

Good. Arsenal tapped Fabregas up, took him to London for a pittance, acted like he was their own academy raised player even though Barca made him, then cried when he wanted to go home. They stole a kid off Barca and whined because they only made Â£30M off of his sale. But again, fantastic for us, now he plays for Chelsea.

#5. Then they tried to blame it all on Fabregas when they sold him that he didn't do enough, even his goodbye message on their website basically slammed him for it.  Also that by buying Fabregas they basically fucked themselves because they sold Thiago Alcantara to Bayern.  Uh, hello, you guys were the fuckers who tapped up Fabregas and used every shady method to get him, it's your own fault he didn't pan out the way you wanted him to.

He is great friends with a number of their players including Messi. They may have some bitter back room staff but that is the way Barca and Real Madrid are, and I would not have it any other way. But again, fantastic for us, he plays for Chelsea. You keep highlighting reasons to like Barca.

#6. I don't remember who in their organization, maybe their president said that Cristiano Ronaldo was only the 12th best player in the world, because the best 11 are all Barcelona players.  Also when they lost against Chelsea in 2012 they cried injustice and that it was a sad day for football, basic bullshit you wouldn't hear presidents of other teams say in general.

Its almost as though Barca and Real Madrid are the two biggest clubs in the world and have a massive geo-political rivalry. Its strange how point 6 about something someone may have said about a hero of Manchester United and Real Madrid dovetails into how Barca felt bitter when we beat them in 2012. Why not make it point 7? And what does this have to do with Chelsea? ""Fuck Barca, they disrespected Ronaldo"".

Anyway, sounds like they were as butt hurt in 2012 as we were in 2009, goes back to my point that the score was settled in 2012. Move on. We are not Arsenal, we are Champions League winners. The whole narative of 2012 was overcoming past injustices and hardships. Without them, 2012 would not have been so magical. 

#I know I could think of a ton more examples but I've ranted enough.  I truly believe Barcelona are the only team in the world who take asshatery to a new level, they are motherfuckers beyond motherfuckers.

Then you have never heard if Real Madrid, their equal in all things arsehatery. 

But in conclusion, the question was ""who do we hate most?"".

I merely said I dont hate Barca, we have shared players, shared paths to glory and injustice, and they fucked Arsenal and Manchester United (our actual rivals) in CL finals. Imagine if Arsenal had won in 2006. Imagine Man United had won in 2008, 2009 and 2011. Be grateful.

I also have no idea why you try and use Arsenal's (our actual rivals) grievances against Barca to make me dislike them, these are just more reasons to not hate Barcelona. 

Look at it this way. This week we played a perfectly amicable friendly vs Barca. No grudge. No beef. No hype. Had we lost, I would not have cared. A friendly.

This shouldn't come as much of a surprise to anyone with a modicum of sense:

 - In real terms, salaries have been decreasing for well over a decade. Basically, if you're not super-rich, chances are you're in exactly the same place or perhaps slightly worse off than you were ten years ago. (This isn't entirely true if your salary has been going up with promotions and such, but even then if you correct for inflation, a staggering amount of the extra you are earning has been swallowed up that way).
 - Mortgage rates? Often fixed. Personal loans? Fixed. Credit cards? Variable, but nothing to do with the base rate of interest anyway. Manipulating interest rates to fiddle with how the general public spends their money simply isn't a terribly effective tool any more. You'll affect people taking out new borrowing, sure, but you'll do very little with existing borrowing. This wasn't the case 20 years ago, when fixed interest rate deals were usually a lot less competitive.

Upshot? Spending is cooling off, and all the interest rate changes in the world aren't changing that.",null,0,null,1438240337,null,0,false,0,ctlavgn,null,t3_3f324w,null,t1_ctlavgn,null,t1_ctladvo,null,null,null,1440174324,null,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9,null

So my anecdote is that I woke up in hospital after hitting a car. To this day I have no idea what happened, I'm just grateful I woke up; without a helmet, who knows what would have happened, I think it's safe to say I may not have woken up.

I've actually read a comment on the (I think) London Cyclists Facebook page where someone was saying how his brother went head-first into a windscreen, destroyed his helmet, but lived with no life-changing injuries. This was followed by a comment by an anti-helmeter claiming that the fact the helmet was destroyed proved it didn't work, and actually maybe it was the windscreen collapsing that saved his life.

I get the case for no helmets (discourages wider population, makes it seem dangerous) but as long as I live in London and have to share the road with arseholes, I'll wear a helmet.",null,0,null,1438240987,null,0,false,0,ctlb2ii,null,t3_3f29kv,null,t1_ctlb2ii,null,t1_ctla57u,null,null,null,1440174416,null,4,false,londoncycling,t5_2wcdj,4,null

What I think people fundamentally misunderstand is that student loans from the Student Loans Company are not 'real' debt in the same way that say a mortgage is from a bank. The key difference here is that you have no credit risk whatsoever with student loan repayments. As you only pay back a certain percentage over a certain threshold, then they are in a way a wealth tax. It's almost like saying income tax puts people off going to work. 

A student loan is the best loan you will ever get and the current system is very generous. Without a higher education I'd wouldn't have been able to get into the field I'm working in now and as such I don't mind how much I would have to pay because my repayments are limited.

I am Austrian and I watched him a lot when he was at Austria, Basel and Kiev... but also on the national team. He is superb and one of those players who has it all brained out. All his transfers were shunned by everybody and he has always proven that it was right.  
  
When he went to Basel, everybody was like ""Why the hell is he going there? He could do so much better! He should play in Germany."" ... he became a starter, regularly played Champions League and knocked out some big clubs on the way. People noticed him.  
  
When he went to Kiev, everybody was like ""Why he hell is he going THERE?! Ukraine of all places. He will be away from everybody's radar there. He should play in the Premier League!"" and he has won the championship there, advanced in the EL and he's playing CL now with a good team.  
  
He was in contact with Bayern, Barcelona, Manchester United. It did not happen because he was not granted a first team spot. He has no reason whatsoever to change to a team where he does not play. With us, he would likely be behind our captain and Stones. Yes, he would get some time playing but it will not be enough. He wants Europe, he wants exposure and he wants a first team spot. And he comes from the Ukraine where his wage is probably quite good.  
  
If it happens, I am not sure it works out for both parties. I don't think he would be happy here and I don't think we would be happy with a player who will definitely leave once his contract expires. He will also not nail down a long term deal because he knows what he can do. He is a very good proven and young defender who would be a starter for almost any team in the PL except maybe for the biggest ones. For us, the only reasons why we would not really start him every time is that we cannot realistically bench our captain and we are actively pushing our homegrown star Stones.

Liberals are for lower tariffs. So we oppose the Common External Tariff that prevents the UK getting the same free trade deal with China that the Swiss and Norwegians have.

Liberals are against wasteful subsidies to prop up failing industries. So we oppose the Common Agricultural Policy.

Liberals are for power to be exercised at the lowest possible level. So we oppose handing powers to a Super-state over our industrial regulations, employment regulations, social policy, etc etc.

Liberals are for democratic control rather than executive power. So we oppose the over-powerful executive of the EU.

Liberals are for rule of law. And so when the plain black text of the EU treaties said the bailing out Greece was illegal we opposed the bailouts.

Liberals are for deregulation wherever possible. And so we oppose the obsessive regulation of trade and industry by the EU.

Liberals are internationalists. So we don't want our foreign policy obsessed with our own back yard, rather we want one that connects all the free-market liberal nations of the world.

Liberals are for fairness in the fight against poverty. And so we oppose wasting international aid money that should be spend on the poor countries of the world on the middle income countries of Eastern Europe under the guise of the Regional Policy.

My biggest gripe with suggesting this kind of action to the average person on the street is that you get shot down as some kind of left wing nut case.

null,false,billy-hoyle,null,null,null,"English here, been going to Maine Road since the late 80s. Honestly, I'm not a huge fan of it... I just don't 'get' it. The main thing I've loved about city is that it's always been my local club (well, until recently anyway), and thus 'my' club. I take alot of pride and joy in whatever happens to us because I've always been a part of it. 

When I was a teenager I started getting into American sports. I decide I liked baseball, so I started following blue jays (family there). I also decided I liked American football, so I followed the Redskins (first team I saw on TV). Lucky, channel 5 in the UK used to show American sports on TV late at night sometimes, so I'd tape my teams when they were on (or stay up on the weekends), follow the results each day, see how they did etc. I think that lasted about a year before I gave up... I just didn't see the point when I had no real affiliation to these teams, and it was unlikely I'd ever see them live (which to me is the whole point of watching sports), apart from the odd holiday if I got lucky. And because there's shit all systems set up over our side of the pond for those sports, I just stopped watching... I'll still watch the superbowl like, but it's a shame not having any real passion for a club to win. And that's why I don't get American city fans - you're situation to me is even more silly than mine was, seeing as though you actually have footy teams over there, and an ever increasing fanbase. I'm going to my second MLS game next week (holiday, woo), and I'm so excited about it. I was at NYRB the other year and the atmosphere in the supporters section was absolutely electric, how could you rather want to get up at 5am and watch English football on tv than actually go to the game and be a part of it?!?

I think it's also important to talk about the reddit side of things - the attitude of some of our recent fans (and it's always mostly American, sorry) is embarrassing. I used to post on here quite regularly, until I eventually got sick of some of the attitude of posters who feel we have this divine right to win every game, due to that's all them really having experience of us doing. I'd said I'd come back this season to see if it's changed much, and well... here I am anyway. Obviously there are some foreign fans that are a credit to the club, and maybe this next bit is terribly wrong - but I feel they're in the minority (or at least in the vocal minority - which is the only thing that really matters when on the Internet). I don't post much on /r/soccer much anymore either - I cringe at some of the posts our 'fans' make and I can't really be arsed with it.

Saying that, I don't like the flip side of this place either, in which there's a constant backlash from people desperately trying not to come across as glory hunters. You've got that Melberger lad, who's every fifth post is reminding people his first game was in the 98/99 season (wow...), getting involved in confrontation on here in most threads (or at least that's the state the sub was in when I stopped posting back in March/April), and the whole place just descended into a whole mess of people trying to prove theyre worthy of support. Maybe this year will be better.

Indeed, we (Europe) have a remarkable success story in how we've healed and worked together to repair relations after the two wars. 

Personally I see the EU as a symptom of that cooperation, not a source (although I appreciate the two are somewhat intertwined). I think far larger factors were diplomatic maturity, wisdom in post war reconstruction, the necessity for cooperation due to the Soviet threat from immediately following the war to the 80's, and the advanced state / strength of our regions civil society and institutions.


Given the acrimony and resentment that the EU has recently brought to Europe with its imposition of policy from on-high (Mediterranean Austerity, uncontrolled migration), I actually see its undemocratic impositions as one of the main risks to harmony in Europe at the moment.

Honestly, it really doesn't bother me personally that much and more importantly it doesn't bother our owners as they are actively tapping into the US Market. The only issue i do have though is the increase in ticket prices a larger 'day tripping' fan base will bring. I am lucky as i am 23 with few financial commitments and a decent job so currently my ST is affordable, but the core of our fan base has always been working class families and with the cost of a match ticket now upwards of Â£50 for 90 minutes of football, it really saddens me that a local family may be replaced by a post-takeover foreign fan.

So my issue isn't really with the American fan it is with the detrimental affect it has on the local fan base who have been with the club for generations who are no longer made to feel part of the club. 

You can't have success and not attract fans from around the world though. So unless we want to go back to the darker days then i don't see an alternative.

Chris Squire in 1978

Squire, who founded Yes along with Jon Anderson in 1968, was the only member of the group to appear on all 21 of their studio albums and perform on each of the bandâs tours over the past 46 years (1969â2014). He announced in May that he would not participate in the 2015 Yes summer tour after being diagnosed with acute erythroid leukemia.

Best known for an unusually treble and melodicâand at times powerful, fuzzy and funkyâbass playing style, Squire influenced many rock musicians over the decades and was held in high esteem for his creativity, energy and general good humor. In a testament to his contribution to rock music, many tributes to Squire following his death placed him in the company of Paul McCartney, John Entwistle and Jack Bruce as among the greatest bass players of the genre.

Born in the Kingsbury area of northwest London on March 4, 1948, Christopher Edward Russell Squire began his musical career as a choirboy. Like many working class youth of his generationâhis father was a cab driver and his mother a secretaryâChris rebelled against school authorities as a teenager. He was expelled from school in 1964 for wearing his hair too long and never went back.

Squire picked up the bass without any formal training. It has been reported that a guitarist friend told him that tall people played the bassâSquire was 6â 4â. Playing the Rickenbacker 4001 electric bass, Squireâs musicianship is an ever-present part of the Yes sound. His name became so synonymous with the instrument that in the 1990s Rickenbacker produced a limited edition of their bass in Squireâs name and called it the 4001CS.

Like many artists of his generation, Chris Squire was influenced by the Beatles as a teenager. By 1965, helped along by the Beatlesâ Rubber Soul and other such works, popular music underwent a transition away from the forms and sounds that had dominated in the early 1960s. Musical compositions became more experimental and song lyrics began to take on more sophisticated and abstract social and even political subjects. This development expressed broader social concerns and dissatisfaction among the youth as well as wide layers of both the working class and middle class that came to a head in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

Millions of young people were activated, or radicalized, in that period, but that took a variety of often very confused forms. Drugs were touted by certain artists and middle class intellectuals as âmind-opening,â and a means of escaping the daily drudgery of life or headlines about war and suffering. There is not the slightest evidence that LSD ever produced anything of artistic value; on the contrary, it merely created new illusions and fantasies, and directed people away from changing the world. Nonetheless, so-called psychedelic music emerged and that was not simply the work of musicians high on drugs.

(It might be put another way: the desire to go beyond the formulas of early rock ânâ roll was legitimate, but with what ideas in his head did the average musician pursue that goal? In most cases, musical skill or ambition far outran the level of actual thinking about the world. Various âspiritualâ panaceas, including much nonsense and charlatanry, tended to fill the gapâor rather, failed to fill it.)

The âpsychedelicâ genre incorporated a great deal of confusion, and generated its share of personal tragedy. But some of the musicians who pursued it made an effort, on the one hand, to bring together folk and blues-influenced rock music with new electronic instruments and studio recording techniques. On the other, a variety of non-Western instruments came into play, as well as key and time signature changes that expressed a departure from traditional blues and folk sounds and structures.

Right around the time that the âpsychedelic eraâ was ending, Chris Squire met Jon Anderson. The two talked of their mutual desire to take what they had learned from their experiences in London and create a band with great vocal harmonies, complex musical compositions and positive messages of hope for a better world. By 1968, they agreed that they needed a band name that expressed their optimism and settled quickly on âYes.â

By 1971âafter two commercially unsuccessful albums and several personnel changes, including the addition of Steve Howe on guitar and Rick Wakeman on keyboardsâYes became a central creative force in what would later become known as progressive rock. The albums Fragile (1971), Close to the Edge (1972) and Tales from Topographic Oceans (1973) were all top ten records in the US and UK and each has been certified Platinum orâin the case of Fragile â Double Platinum. All three of these records featured lengthy compositions (some a full album side of 22 minutes), obtuse lyrics, unusual time signatures and multiple key changes.

Squireâs bass is distinct on every Yes track as rhythm, harmony or melody. Recognizing this may be counterintuitive as the bass is often present as a foundationâalong with drumsâon which the melody, lead vocals and/or lead guitar are the dominant musical element. Among the most popular tracks where Squireâs genius can be heard are âYours is No Disgraceâ [an anti-Vietnam War song], âLong Distance Runaround,â âHeart of the Sunriseâ and âClose to the Edge.â

In an online post following Squireâs death, early Yes drummer Bill Bruford paid tribute to his bandmateâs innovative bass-playing: âHe had an approach that contrasted sharply with the somewhat monotonic, immobile bass parts of today. His lines were important; counter-melodic structural components that you were as likely to go away humming as the top line melody; little stand-alone works of art in themselves.â

While Squireâs bass playing is something of a legend, his vocals were also important. With Anderson as the front man, Squire is equally responsible for the Yes nearly choral vocal sound, with his harmonies both above and below Andersonâs lead.

Progressive rock musicâassociated with UK groups such as Pink Floyd, Genesis, Jethro Tull, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer and King Crimsonâbecame tremendously popular during the rise of FM stereo and album-oriented radio (AOR) in the early 1970s. Incorporating classical music themes and orchestral compositions, progressive rock groups rarely made singles and shunned traditional rock ân roll and pop music beats. Meanwhile, progressive rock lyrics often dealt with complex themes, classic literature and poetry or folklore.

Yes was a favorite of AOR and few of their songs could be played on top 40 AM radio due to their length. As a compromise, some Yes tracks were reissued as singles following substantial edits. In 1976, at the height of their popularity, Yes, along with several other bands, played to a crowd of 130,000 at John F. Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphiaâthe largest-ever paid attendance at a rock concert.

Into the late 1970s, progressive rock groups like Yes sought to maintain their relevance and popularity despite the changes in the social climate and the disappearance of the âcounterculture.â Harsher economic and political circumstances, including the devastation of large swathes of industry in the UK and the US, along with the coming to power of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, seemed to many to make progressive rock âconcept albumsâ and their lyrical and instrumental complexity pretentious and overdone. More straightforward and less bombastic forms such as disco and punk rock came into vogue.
Chis Squire in 2013

To their credit, Squire and company persevered. No doubt, an aspect of the enduring appeal of Yes has been the virtuosity of its band members. Along with the contributions of Squire, Anderson, Wakeman, Howe and Bruford, fifteen other musicians have been in Yes over the past 46 years. The group has always stood out as being made up of exceptionally talented instrumentalists, performers and writers.

It is a fact of 1970sâ culture that the anti-war and anti-establishment sentiments expressed by groups like Yes never rose above a relatively low level. Despite the claims of progressive rock that it was breaking a great deal of new ground, and its promise to introduce various historical, cultural, social and even political questions, the genre tended to be rooted in the end in prevailing currents in the media and entertainment world, with all the self-indulgence that implies.

Nonetheless, some fascinating music was made. Chris Squire was one of the finest representatives of the progressive rock generation. Despite the early fame and wealth derived from the commercial success of Yes, as well as the difficulties arising from the eventual decline in the bandâs popularity, Squire remained true to the creative aspirations of his youth until the end of his life.

Finally, I haven't read it in full and it is aimed at students, but you might find [this guide](http://www.nus.org.uk/PageFiles/3080/Deposit_Recovery_Pack.pdf) useful. It has a sample letter before claim and Particulars covering a few different sets of facts.

I'm not an expert, but in my own experience it's actually very difficult to come here and just 'claim benefits'. In order to even be able to fill out a benefit form you need to have a NINO. When you come to the UK you have to apply for a NINO in person, and they won't even let you make an appointment for that unless you have a job. Even if you're due to start a job in a couple of weeks you're not allowed the NINO appointment until you've actually started.

Secondly, and I might be wrong about this, but I seem to remember (when I was applying for housing benefits a few years back) that you need to have worked in the UK for at least 6 months to even qualify.

1.  It's targeting the symptoms, rather than the disease.

2.  The consequences are always even more regulations on tax, which end up costing small businesses the most.  Mostly because they can't so easily restructure themselves.

What do I mean by ""symptoms rather than the disease"".  I think the disease is we have an economy with a poor record of creating wealth, the whole system is centred around preserving the wealth that exists.  The handful of people with $21tn in total overseas assets are bad mostly because it shows there is gross inefficiencies in the economy and/or good-old-fashioned corruption that prevents other people starting businesses in these lucrative areas.  More competition would mean lower prices, lower profits, and revenues being spent on growing the business rather than put straight in the ""profit"" column.

What do I mean by small businesses suffering from tax regulations.

But against teams that we'll likely dominate possession against, who aren't very good at scoring and are likely to park the bus, we're more likely to need our main danger men on the field than a DM.

Other balances will be able to be struck against other teams - dropping both Firmino and Lallana in favour of Sturridge and Lucas  - maintaining a goal threat, being more compact, but possibly ceding possession in midfield and counter-attacking.

null,false,barejokez,null,null,null,"some general points:

* for a small investor such as yourself, you will find that picking individual stocks is very inefficient. there are minimum transaction fees that mean you will incur higher relative costs when trading than a big spender would.  you will also end up spending time deciding what to buy, which will cost time/energy. most people in your situation (sensibly IMO) give the money to management companies, who will either make active decisions on your behalf or just hold the money passively, only reinvesting dividends and making little rebalancing tweaks to the portfolio. the latter is unsurprisingly cheaper, and perhaps a little surprisingly moreorless as good in terms of performance, at least over the long-term.

* you are right that you can't pick stocks without research/knowledge. the easiest method out there is called fundamental analysis. basically, the key (as ever) is to buy cheap, sell expensive. so if i told you there was a company out there who had a single asset, a house worth Â£2m, and they had issued 500,000 equal shares, then it should be fairly obvious that each share is worth Â£4. if you see them trading at Â£3.50, you would buy, if they went to Â£4.50 you'd sell. unfortunately most companies don't tell you what they're really worth, you have to figure it out for yourself. it probably isn't worth it if this isn't your day job!

* risk is generally thought of in stock markets as price volatility.  if i told you there were two companies with similar businesses etc, except one share price moved 1% every day (up or down) and the other moved 5% every day, then they would have very different risk profiles. the second company is more likely to have a month that they never recover from (though they are also more likely to double in value in a month). if you fancy the high stakes gamble that presents, or rather you can afford to lose if it goes wrong, then you are a high risk investor. again, it is more complicated than that, but that hopefully gives a basic understanding. your risk position is defined by where you are now, and where you want to be in x years time, which can be determined by a financial advisor, or by yourself.

And now BHD have been given a monopoly on airport parking - there is no free market pressures to reduce the price to the actual value of the parking.

Yes countries in Europe have been rich but not all, and certainly not all have GDP per capita like Germany, France and Britain. Part of the Marshall agreement was to pump money into industrial areas that had been ravaged by wars and no such agreement was made when the USSR fell. This means the growth needed to satisfy the new labour markets wasn't there. The EU is part of that process economically and socially progressing countries have been part of communism to heal and to make people aspire to a world of humanitarianism rather than patriotism.

On your last point France also has nuclear weapons, the power of fear has stopped war. But mutually assured destruction is not the way Europe or the world should be progressing. Those now developing/potentially developing nuclear programmes are countries like North Korea, Iran and Pakistan. Are these countries safe bastions of Peace? Fear will never solve the problems in Europe, only the progression to work a united group of different cultures with different aspirations and goals will see peace continue and the economy fixed.

British Gas appears to be healthy and growing. I would imagine that centrica will continue to grow British Gas and probably recruit in that area.

- Liberals are for lower tariffs. The EU eliminates tariffs within the biggest single economic area on the planet and has free trade agreements with almost the entire world.

- Liberals are against wasteful subsidies. The EU eliminates a lot of unfair subsidies and levels the playing field. That some anachronisms still exist are not evidence of the EU being a feast of silly subsidies.

- Liberals are for power to be exercised at the lowest possible level. The lowest *possible*. Climate change can't be solved by the Borough of Lambeth, it requires international cooperation. International cooperation is better when it's democratic and not three plus degrees away from the people through treaties.

- Liberals are for rule of law. The EU has expanded the rule of law to both new EU members and trading partners. I'm not sure one example that not everyone agrees on means that it's not.

- Liberals are for deregulation whenever possible. That means regulating a little to deregulate a lot. If you know the history of regulation in European countries since the EU was started, you'd know that whatever standards and bureaucracy the EU creates, it eliminates ten times that.

- Liberals are internationalists. I'm not sure I even get the point here... In what way is an EU membership negating internationalism?

- Liberals are for fairness in the fight against poverty. I guess we can disagree here, but what the EU has done for Eastern Europe is outstanding. That it's politically different to help Sub-Saharan Africa in the same way doesn't negate what you *can* do.

Maybe the EU needs to look outwards more, but removing the UK from the equation will not make the EU or the UK more internationally oriented.

In my opinion the safest you can be is knowing the rules of the road and not cycling like a dick but a helmet is there for other road users (including cyclists) that take chances and don't drive safely

Our bodies have adapted well to prevent injury within its own means. I.e a small knock to the head causes concussion protecting the brain

But Bikes are an invention that's soul purpose is travel faster that you normally can on foot which our bodies hasn't had millions of years to adapt to. Average walking pace is 4 - 5 mph compare that to a bike of an average pace of 10 - 12mph although on my rides and others rides this is much higher. if you fall off you would travel double if not more the speed exerting that much force on your head. All this plus sharing a road with other fast moving vehicles which can be as much as 44 tones (articulated lorry)

And if you got hit by a car the forces of what the car was traveling at would also added on to any of the force that hits your head 

Also friction if your travelling at those kinds of speeds do you really want to be dragging you head (a place with very thin skin along) some hard Tarmac? It's will most likely go to the bone

The risks are huge and a head injury, life changing. Helmets may not save your life but will save you from causing long term damage to the most important part of you. Your brain.

Of course, other measures might be taken by our benevolent capitalist overlords, such as using their immense wealth to ensure the political system is heavily influenced by them, discouraging the mass of people from engaging or caring about politics, and/or simply arranging that the state is dependent upon private finance to function, so that capitalist institutions will be protected at any cost. One might even call them 'too big to fail'.

It also might help to encourage a mentality of apathy and even disgust toward the unemployed and/or low skilled/paid workers in general, making it more acceptable and excusable to simply 'not care' about them or what happens to them.

In countries like Nigeria they were able to nip ebola in the bud, and the outbreak was not that large (only 20 cases), this is because they have things like hospitals and doctors and by african standards a really good healthcare system. The places where the outbreak persisted did not have this. 

We have two options, we can either help out the people in africa to make their healthcare better, which will mean that they can all be as efficient as nigeria was, or we can wait until the next outbreak, and deal with another international emergency and thousands of deaths.

null,false,NEWSBOT3,cnty-uk,Londontown,null,"i think you are out of date on a few points, given the changes in recent years by recent governments.

For a start, there is a credit risk - i'm on the old (2001+) system and currently lose around 9% of my post-tax income to a student loan payment - its a fair chunk of cash, far more than a z1-5 travel card is! - money that is assessed as disposable income when applying for a mortgage, loan or other form of credit. It might not be assessed as a form of credit that I have, (which is also a BAD thing, since it could count towards a repaid credit history if it was a normal loan, and that makes you more attractive to lenders), but it does affect credit that I can get, and I feel saying it doesn't affect it is incorrect.

secondly, it is not 'the best loan you will ever get' and hasn't been for some time, since the interest rates are now higher than many commercial loans. Moneysavingexpert shows 7-15k loans on 3.5% interest rates (they don't list higher amounts, but if they did it would likely be ~ 2.5-3% mark)  - vs RPI plus 3-6% on the current student loan repayments. Current RPI is 1% but has been as high as 15% in the past, so its no longer cheaper than private loans either since the min interest is now 4-7% depending on your income.

The only remaining advantage it has over private finance is the flexibility in repaying it. I personally don't think that will exist in a few years time though - the government has already tried once to sell the student loans off to a private company, and once they have done so , you can bet they'll get lobbied to death to be allowed to chase them just like private loans are.

What changed in 2003? What ""mortgage type"" did they change to? And what was the outstanding debt at that point?

And why do they want Â£20k now? It's only been 17 years since 1998, so the term can't be up already. How long was the original mortgage term?

When this happened I first sent a letter before action demanding the entire deposit be return (legal right). I think pride got the better of him and it eventually ended up in a county court. It cost a few quid and took a few months, but you do get the costs passed onto the guilty party. In the case of not protecting deposits it's almost 99% likely they will be found at fault.

Yes attending the court was a stressful pain in the arse, but it was worth it - I received x2 deposit plus original deposit and court fees - more importantly the sense of justice was priceless. You are almost certain to win against a professional landlord or estate agent, because it's their core business and there's simply no excuse not to protect a tenant's deposit - they cannot claim innocence through ignorance. In my case this was the landlord's excuse (he has a Â£3mil BTL portfolio...) - somehow the judge bought it, hence not giving the maximum x3.

For anyone else in the same situation I would recommend using the legal frameworks at your disposal over being nice.

Yep. You may also have to pay council tax at ~Â£100/month (the charge is per residence, not per person). The amount varies with the value of the property. Edit - you won't see this at airbnb but you'll have to pay it when you rent a place of your own

You will probably pay into a pension too, which cuts down on the take-home but is still money you get. Typical amounts are in the region of 3-5% contributed by the employee.

&gt; Regarding health insurance, will my employment allow me to have NHS coverage here in the UK?

If you normally live here and work here, then I think so, yes. Here's more information on it:

https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/healthcare/help-with-health-costs/nhs-charges-for-people-from-abroad/

&gt; Should I obtain private health insurance as I have a chronic arthritis condition?

I don't see any reason why you would need to.

&gt; Is there something I should be extremely careful or wary of regarding letting a flat

Your deposit must be protected under a deposit protection scheme. That means that neither you nor your landlord get access to the money until the tenancy ends and you agree on an amount to be taken. There is a process for settling disputes, too.

&gt; Is my expectation of saving Â£1000/month unreasonable?

On 60k with a 1500/mo rent, you've got Â£2k left to spend on things. I don't see why 1k isn't doable, but it'll depend on your budget.

&gt; Is it reasonable to expect Â£50/day worth of expenses for food / transportation / coffee if planning on eating out two to three times a week? I understand this varies, just looking for an idea.

Transport will probably be the big one, depending on where you're coming from in London but instinctively that sounds like quite a lot.

&gt; I would take home around Â£3500 per month.. which doesnât seem like a lot.

Well, it is a lot.

Think of it like Premier Division football.

Unskilled work does not require much English or training. The wage disparity from the UK means the boost in wages coming to the UK would be huge for the majority of the qualified people.

null,false,someoddballguy,null,null,null,"&gt;Unity is great thing, the lack of trade barriers makes it much easier for individuals to grow businesses and become more engaged in the global marketplace.

I agree, EFTA is wonderful, so is NAFTA. I'm all for being in both, heck, I'm all for merging them. It's the political union that scares me. 

I loved reading your comment. It's such a lovely vision of a utopian future, where unity and cooperation lead to peace. It left me with a smile on my face. Then I read it a second time and tried to find the part where there was an argument. And I notice there isn't one. Unity is progress, progress causes peace, we must all put aside our differences by joining an supernational institution. These seem to be so obvious to you that you've forgotten that I think they're flat false.

Consider the period up to 1900 or so. Divided nations with huge cultural differences (but open trade) didn't cause Europe to become weak. A united nation with few cultural difference and centralisation caused China to become (comparativly) a sickly insular state.

&gt;Who could deny that [making a united nation out of the Middle East] would be a huge step towards peace? 

Me for a start, and the entire state of Israel for a second. Look at the damage that inventing places like Iraq did. Look at what happened to the Kurds when their state was wiped out and replaced with a super state that didn't care about them. 

&gt;The EU is part of that process economically and socially progressing countries have been part of communism to heal and to make people aspire to a world of humanitarianism rather than patriotism.

I agree, the EU is doing a great job to fix the horrors of communism. But it's doing (comparatively) nothing to help African development, and I know which one I think is a higher priority. We should care about the poor who live in distant lands rather than the middle-income people close by.

&gt;It just seems simple the UK as a permanent member of the UN security council leaving the EU would serve as the first blow to peace in Europe.

Why? What would it do to the military situation? Whose army would have a better chance of victory because the EU had one fewer member? Who would think the risks of war less because there was a security council member acting independently? *We're* not going to start a war in Europe, we'd have nothing at all to gain by it.

Communism is the idea that everyone has equal wealth and lives in equal prosperity. Basically there is no money, and everyone works and takes what they need when they need it. In Maos China this was abused as workers were forced to work by the whip and extremely malnourished while the Chinese elite made a killing getting rich. 

Socialism is historically the idea that the factors of production should be controlled by the working class. Although, the present context is generally that we need to take better care of the lower classes, ensuring that whilst hundreds of thousands lf childen are living below the poverty line in the UK (which they are), the mega rich shouldn't be earning enough to buy islands and golden socks etc etc. Socialism recognises capitalism, and the two are compatible.

If oil went down by 100% (i.e. it became free), fuel duty would still be there so petrol wouldn't be free, it wouldn't go down in price by 100% but by a lot less.

I remember looking at how much of the fall in oil proces had been passed on to customers and it was almost all of it. When oil was at about $120 a barrel the cost of oil was about 40p of the 135p petrol cost. If oil halves it would lead to a 20p reduction in petrol prices, which is more or less what prices are now (117p). These numbers are all off the top of my head and I'm on my phone, but I don't think they're too wrong, if anyone wants to provide better figures they're welcome to.

Edit: As per the comment below, here's the breakdown [the BBC did](http://www.bbc.com/news/business-15462923) regarding the price of petrol on 8 November 2011, two weeks earlier a barrel of Brent was trading at $109. The cost of oil in a litre of petrol was then 45.2p.

It takes between 7 and 14 days for oil price changes to reach the customers, and as two weeks ago the price of Brent stood at $57 (i.e. 47.7% less) we would expect oil to be 23.6p of the price. Assuming the cost of refining (1.5p), delivery and retailer margin (7.1p) have stayed the same (not at all likely given inflation, particularly rent going up) this would mean the price of a litre before VAT should be 90.2p.

It is actually 96.6p.

So out of the fall 21.6p drop in the cost of fuel,  16.2p has been passed onto the customer.",null,0,null,1438256759,null,0,1438269467,0,ctlf58f,null,t3_3f4xxx,null,t1_ctlf58f,null,t1_ctleyft,null,null,null,1440176337,null,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11,null

null,false,Kartalon,eu,Spain,null,"I am a Spanish immigrant. I came here to study my Master's Degree with the savings I had made working in Spain and some help from my family.

After finishing my Master's Degree I had depleted almost all my savings, I didn't work while I was studying to focus on getting my MSc. I had two options: asking my family for money to buy a Ryanair ticket and return to a country going through a terrible economic situation or trying to find a job here as soon as possible. I decided the later and to be able to survive until I found a job, I decided to claim JSA.

When I went to the Job Centre I remember being the only non-English person there. While I was doing my interview I remember a young English guy next to me shouting to his interviewer because he had missed several appointments. The lady interviewing me was really nice, and seemed almost delighted to help me through my claim, assuring me I should not worry because someone as skilled as I was should find a job quite easily. I told her that I would rather start working already rather than claiming JSA but she told me she could not help me to find a skilled position and that I should keep looking as I was doing already while going on with my claim. I found a job three weeks after that.

Since then I have been working in the UK, paying my taxes and trying to contribute to a country and a city that I found very welcoming since I arrived. But when I hear some arguments against immigrants, I honestly cannot avoid feeling guilty because I claimed benefits being an immigrant... And I can tell you it is a feeling that I have heard from other fellow Spanish immigrants and some of them do not even claim benefits because of this ""guilt"".

Why should I feel guilty? Just because I was not born here?

Some people do not realise of this kind of stuff when they make some comments. And when they realise that you are there and that you are actually an immigrant they are like... ""Oh, but it is not the same in your case, you actually came here to study and got a degree, and so on"".

How is it different? Do you really think that other immigrants come here, to a country that has a different culture and language, just to claim benefits? No, everyone that sacrifices so much to go to a different country do so to find a better opportunity. No one would move to a different country just to prey on the social welfare system.

And the figures just reflect that.

Once again everyone I have met and all my English friends are the most welcoming people ever, and I am really thankful to this country for giving me opportunities I wouldn't have had back in Spain. But when I listen some debates on TV or some comments in a pub, I cannot avoid to get infuriated by how ignorant some people are about what motivates immigration.",null,0,null,1438257232,null,0,1438267101,0,ctlfapq,null,t3_3f4vzd,null,t1_ctlfapq,null,t3_3f4vzd,null,null,null,1440176409,null,45,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,45,null

Turkish Restaurants in North London have queues outside the doors most evenings - it all suggests that people in the UK, well London at least, really like foreign stuff and are prepared to pay a premium for it in some cases.

China Town, Korean, Thai, Indian, Vietnamese, Ethiopian, Japanese cuisine all flourishes here.

Will there be snap elections after the Dail [or whatever replaces it] changes to accomodate [ex]NI politicians? What about the judiciary?
