null,false,Battle_Biscuits,null,null,null,"One thing I'd point out that this article seems to miss is that these graduate schemes are insanely competitive and that a relatively small proportion of graduates from university actually get to work with these sort of employers anyway.

I graduated from a respectable top 10 university that drew a lot of attention from banks, consultancies and all other major graduate recruiters- but I can only think of two British graduates who I know who actually got on what I'd call a ""prestigious"" graduate scheme- Those being the NHS and M&amp;S management trainee schemes. In my experience the vast majority of graduates find work in medium sized businesses or general entry roles in larger organisations. Examples include teaching, civil service administration, retail assistant work, office work, secretarial/PA work, trainee manager roles, sales, marketing and IT consultants in medium sized organisations. It's very rare for a graduate to actually be on the sort of ""prestigious"" fast tracking graduate schemes that the author is talking about here.

So I don't really think what the author's talking about is much of a problem, because so few graduates actually work on these ""prestigious"" graduate schemes anyway. 

I'd also question the assumption that these graduate schemes are actually capturing our ""best"" graduates. Rather, they're capturing the graduates who are best at passing their very narrowly defined and sometimes bizzare testing procedures. Thinking of the graduates who I know who I would call talented, none work for a ""prestigious"" graduate scheme.

After building a suitable emergency fund you need to think about what you want to use your money for in the future. Funds you intend on using in the next few years should probably be kept reasonably liquid in current accounts. Funds which you want available further down the road (e.g. 10+ years like retirement) check out step 4 of the earlier linked article. Chances are mix of both will be best but at what ratio is for you to decide given your goals.

Does the private student loan have an interest rate? If it does, and it is high, it might be worth just paying it off out right especially whilst you can afford it. Your credit will improve with time as long as you pay your credit bills on time. To this end it might be useful to get a credit card and put your normal expenditure on it and pay it off in full every month. It won't cost anything (proving you pay in full every month), will give you credit history and can even offer extra protection (Section 75 laws) and some perks (cashback on a dwindling number of cards).

a) It may not be legal. Doing things that aren't legal weakens the general framework of international law that we all rely on. In particular, regime change (which is what you're suggesting as a main reason to attack) is not legal.

b) Our evidence turned out not to be sound. Therefore some people in the chain of command made it out to be more certain than it actually way. This is anti-democratic and harms our own political process.

c) We don't have an active teleporting system. It was impossible to get Saddam out of Iraq without a fight. Therefore, we owe it to ourselves to view the consequences for those who fight, those who die, and those left around afterwards. We got very little of the aftermath right.

tl;dr We need to consider international action like a doctor doing surgery. The Hippocratic oath is a good guide here: First, do no harm.

1. You need to pay council tax.  This is set by the council within which you live.  When you rent, you need to register with the council, and they will then send you a bill for the year's council tax (pro-rata'd for the number of months left in their financial year).
2. Electricity and Water and Gas are quoted as annual fees - you can pay it as a lump sum, or as a monthly direct debit.
3. Ditto insurance for household / vehicle.  When you buy car insurance, be sure to give them the date of issue of your South African license.  Also, you can only drive in the UK for a year on the SA license before you need to convert it over to the UK license.  Luckilly for we saffers, this is as simple as going to the DVLA and filling in a form and handing in your license.
4. Healthcare on the NHS - this is covered by your NHI contributions, but this doesn't cover e.g the dispensation of medicines or things like Dentistry.

With the Internet connection, you're right about the product differences between FTTC and EoFTTC. The SLA and minimum guaranteed bandwidth is one of the essential things for us. The connection issues last time were down to the ISP the venue use applying traffic shaping on the connections, something that is not going to happen this time. The same amount of connectivity was used at our July event last year and there were no issues experienced.

&gt; As a subpoint to that one, many of the trusts will award themselves external contracts for these things, to make profits.

You're talking about something that runs as a completely closed off system where you can predict all non-human external factors acting on that system perfectly. Thus a ride should be able to be designed to be completely and totally safe - you can account for every single possible point of failure, barring situations involving some sort of esoteric disaster like a hurricane or a terrorist attack, or situations that are due to human error or malicious intent. The human error would be later accounted for in the design process as fail-safes are added, preventing a trained operator from ever fucking up and causing an accident like this if their needs and management are being met.

As to your second point I think you are fixating on the money. That is nice but its not the only reason people work in finance. If fact talk to anyone who is truly successful in the field and they will tell you the same thing, money is a scorecard, nothing more, nothing less.

You wouldn't expect all the carts to be in the stations, one would be out on the track somewhere, waiting for one to leave the station and enter the first block so it can move into the last block. Let me illustrate it.

The [ ] represent a block brakes section where the cart is held, [X] means a cart is there, --- is track and --x-- illustrate a cart on the track somewhere. The two Block sections on either end is representing a station with two carts in. I don't know how many carts were running or how many block sections are on the Smiler, although from memory it is two block sections with 3 carts. I could be wrong.

**Current Situation:** They send all 3 empty carts around once to test the ride.


[X][X]------------[X]-----------[ ]---------[X][X] - Cart 1 starts going around, Cart 2 won't leave until Block Section 1 is clear, Cart 3 is sitting behind the station waiting to move into the station when Cart 2 moves out.

[X][ ]-----X------[ ]-----X------[ ]---------[X][  ] - Cart 1 moves onto the next section, allowing Cart 2 and Cart 3 to move up

[ ][X]------------[X]----------[X]---------[ ][X] - Carts get to their new sections, Cart 1 will now move to behind the station where there is free space, Cart 2 will move up a block section and Cart 3 will leave the station.

[X][X]------------[ ]-----------[X]---------[X][X] - The carts continue their cycle and eventually get to the station where they are held up because they are empty and now need riders to be put on them. Only two carts are in the station. One cart is expect to be out on track waiting at the final block section so it can move into the station when there is space. Therefore it is perfectly reasonable for the cart to not be back at station.

The situation they were actually in at this point looks like this. 

[X][X]------------[ ]-----X-----[ ]---------[X][X]

With cart 3 stuck between the two block sections. Cart 1 then leaves the station and moves to block section 1, but for some reason it is allowed through and not stopped.

[ ][X]------------[X]-----X-----[ ]---------[ ][X]

[ ][X]------------[ ]-----XX-----[ ]---------[ ][X]


**tl;dr** It is perfectly reasonable for the ride operators to expect there be a cart on the track somewhere and not in the station.

After this event was successful last year we're doing it again complete with different format!

* 4 Qualifying tournaments - epic.FIFTEEN serving as one (see sidebar) and three online cups (30th June, 28th July, 18th August all starting at 19:00BST) with all the winning teams getting four day passes to EGX (24th-27th September at the NEC) with the finals occurring on the Sunday of the expo!

* 4/5 players in any given map must be playing from the UK or the Republic of Ireland. Apologies for this limitation but last year a foreign team caused us all sorts of consternation by dropping out after securing qualification.

* http://egx2015.epiclan.net/tournaments/june - check this out for more details as to how the qualis will be run. As always, details are subject to change.

* No confirmed details on the prize yet but the nice men at EGX refer to it as 'hundreds of pounds of prizes' so expect some cool hardware I guess? https://www.egx.net/egx/news/dota-2-challenge-returns-to-egx

* Any questions please ask me or one of the other reprobates.

I don't blame you, the UK press is absolutely atrocious at conveying the impacts of devolution. I worked for a politician and the day after the news reports ""The cost of a prescription is to go up to..."" we were inundated with complaints from people who demanded they should still be free. Of course, they are free in 3 of the 4 nations of the UK, it's just hard to see that. The BBC are getting better, but there's still more that can be done, especially in less clear-cut areas such as the Environment. 

Anyway... 

The Conservatives' ideology says that the private sector can do things better; so they'll have BAE or whoever run schools rather than local councils. Instead of making difficult/controversial decisions about the curriculum, they'll let mentalist/extremist churches run their own schools and pass the blame.

I am trying to decide What To Do. See, when i moved to London, i expected to only be here maybe 5 years. Year 4 comes around in a month or so. I could get current job to relocate me to Edinburgh next year, and i'd be able to afford to buy a place to live up there. But the job situation is much trickier, harder to get pay rises and so on.


If i stay here another 5 years, my earning potential is crazy, (ie, doubling my salary is possible), but i dont know if i could do London for another 5 years. I like the place, but I also miss the north. Idk.


Maybe i should just plan to be here till 2018 (when my student loan is paid off , and i'll have a reasonable-mortgage type-house-deposit) , and then reconsider.

The two main things that have come out of academy related discussions are:

 1. the reasons schools are ""failing"" and need rescue/conversion can often be related directly to lack of funding. E.g. central London school gets an influx of kids for whom English is not their first language ... or may not speak it at all. Obviously they will need extra English tutoring, this may include extensive out of hours teaching and possibly tutoring to help them catch up on classes and homework in which their lack of English skills held them back. Funding for this sort of thing may not be properly considered (or hugely underestimated) in budgets but getting the extra funding to pay for tutors or staff overtime can be impossible to prise out of the authorities. Thus the kids do poorly, the schools average scores come down and they are ""failing"". Spending the money to convert the schools in solving the actual problems within the existing structure is not seriously considered because academies are ""the way"".
 2. The academies can become exam factories. Sports? Nah. Arts? Meh. Proper breaks for the kids? Nope. Lunch Hour? *Hour*??! Must be joking. Homework? Kids better learn to love it (and teachers marking ...). Kids having a proper understanding of the subjects? Does not matter as long as they can pass the exams.

Um, the actual ride operator in the booth will have served 2-3 seasons minimum as a ride host before receiving operator training. They won't be 16. They might be young (20-21) but they will be experienced.

Current thinking seems to be that there must have been a fault in the block-signalling system that is supposed to prevent such incidents happen (Smiler has 5 blocks each with a brake unit - theoretically you can run 5 trains simultaneously^1 and if any of them got too close the ride can shut itself down and stop trains before there's a collision).

That said, there almost certainly seems to be a level of human error in there that they sent out a loaded car at all when the test train hadn't made it back in. Had a delay, queues growing, start cutting corners to get people loaded... :(

A CBT should be a full day, but the CBT is woefully inadequate for safe riding. Your car driving will help a bit, but only in that you know the rules of the road [at least vaguely]

There is only so much they can teach in that day. Extra lessons are worth their weight in gold, before bad habits creep in. And start getting them as soon after the CBT as possible, to prevent you forgetting what you were taught.

Okay. You are aware of protein energy malnourishment right? Soya is not the ideal protein, it's egg. No eggs for vegans. Some vegetarians in India don't eat egg. PEM is more common in them. Iron Deficiency is also more common. You get iron fortified food in the west SPECIFICALLY to stop this while in India such food is pricey. In fact anaemia is so common that India has dropped the bands for anaemia by 1g%. 

I have seen people 2 to 3 g% haemoglobin counts thanks to this. All on restricted diets. And no, are you stupid? In India most people are vegetarians. Vegetarianism is the norm. Oh and eating meat is associated with better growth and health. You are lucky to have supplemented food. Hell? In order to combat this problem India has one of the largest free supplement schemes. 

The fact you take supplements indicates you aren't eating a healthy and complete diet and have to rely on us to make up your failed diet with medicine. Your B12 is a medication, people take it when they have problems. You are purposefully eating a diet that's poor in a nutrient solely because there is a drug for it. If insulin is a drug, so is B12. 

Yes. Yes they do. Poor Children. Not everyone is a rich white guy in a western nation. Even your beggars eat better than my patients. You guys don't starve. My patients do. Going ""poor children have it so hard/sarcasm"" is imbecilic. 

Not everyone has access to medicine SOLELY for the purpose of validating a stupid diet.

As far as defenders go, the Stearman/Batth partnership has been getting better as time has gone on.  Batth is still young and makes a mistake here and there but he will mature as Stearman has.  I would like to see this as our partnership for the next few years, adding in a new central defender would probably unsettle them.  Ebanks-Landell played well at CB, might be worth waiting to see how him and our other academy graduates progress rather than buying new players.

Corkscrew had plastic torsos full of water that they could put into the seats to ballast empty trains.

Now Smiler *can* get around empty, and they use ""trim brakes"" to slows trains if they're going too fast (e.g. if you have a rugby team riding weighing 2000kg rather than 16 teenage girls at 1200kg). Obviously entering a loop too fast will increase the g the riders pull, which may not be desirable if it's already a high-g ride by design.

They have had problems with the trim brakes in testing - a ballasted train got stuck in the bottom of a loop after being too aggressively trimmed and wasn't left with enough energy to get around the next loop.

&gt; You have no settled non-mail order credit accounts.

Look at getting a credit card (probably through your bank).  Use it for all day-to-day spending, but **set up a DD to pay it off in full every month**.

That'll build up your credit and show that you are a responsible borrower.  *Never* miss a payment.

&gt; I would think that I am a high-risk high-reward, most likely out of naivety, open still to to every stance of saving/investing. 

Learn to play poker or put your money on some good looking horses!

Honestly, at the moment you do not have enough money to start ""investing.""  You need to get a sizeable emergency fund (at least 3 months market rent + food &amp; essentials).  Once you've done that - and paid off your debts - build up an ISA.  Once that's maxed out - start trying to beat the market.

&gt; I make pension contributions of 2% and my employer makes a fixed %3. I have looked into upping my contribution to 7% (+5% as an AVC) for a %10 total, but I have yet to make this final.

Not unrealistic at all.  Ok, maybe not for 2X, but the fees involved in selling and moving house are insane.  It keeps lots of people trapped in jobs they don't like.

Overall your spending looks pretty good - although by going for a jog &amp; joining a library you can save a couple of hundred pounds per year.

Suppose you have 5000 schools. Suppose at no point do standards change in any school.

You grade them 1 through 5 with 1 being the best and 5 being ""inadequate."" You split the grades evenly because giving them all 1s simply isn't how grading works even if they're all good. Say they split the grades evenly. 1000 schools get 5s and are turned into academies.

Next year you grade the remaining schools. Only 4000 now. Again let's split the grades evenly - 800 in each category. So 800 schools get 5s and get turned into academies even though standards are unchanged - with the removal of the schools that had been worse than them they're the new bottom tier.

Obviously there's a limit to that - don't get a supersport or a litre bike - but there's no reason at all to think that a 125 is safer than, say, an ER-6F or a CBR500 or whatever mid-sized standard bike you want. 

Having recently ridden both my girlfriend's YBR125 and my own Versys, the YBR feels less stable, it's harder to see, and if someone is driving dangerously near you, your only option is to slow down so they pass or stop, neither of which are always the safest option.

Hell, the biggest one for me is the stability. Those bikes are so light and fluttery that even the smallest pot holes or bumps in the road will throw you off your line, and that means you've got one more thing that demands more attention than it should. 

As someone who's been driving before, you should already know how to control the urge to speed when it's inappropriate. Go for a full license and a mid-sized bike.

EDIT: I should point out that by ""folks"" I meant ""some folks."" Evidently it's not a majority who disagree with me.

EDIT2: The other thing worth mentioning is that with a larger bike you can often get more bike for your money. An older SV650 or ER-5 or something like that could end up cheaper to buy than a 125, although the fuel economy is almost always going to be worse. Point is, making your mistakes on a YBR125 isn't necessarily cheaper than making them on something bigger - and you're likely to lose a fair bit of cash from the 125 devaluing over time, plus you're still gonna do the DAS eventually.

null,false,joepo32,null,null,null,"&gt;No. It doesn't. 

Yes it does.

&gt;Whoever the president of FIFA is makes no difference to domestic football or European competition. 

Yes it does when World cups are put in the middle of the season. Meaning players have to miss out on competition. 

&gt;It will makes a difference to the very few players that are involved in the World Cup, and to the miniscule number of fans that would be travelling to attend the World Cup. Although even if it does change, then they would just go somewhere else anyway and it's not like they would have booked anything. 

It makes a difference to anyone that loves football. And it matters to fans who aren't even going to the world cup. Most of us don't care to watch people die trying to build stadiums. We don't want the sport to be full of corruption. 

&gt;&gt; It is a huge thing for the sport as a whole. 

&gt;No, it's a huge thing for interational football. Not club football. 

Which is part of football as a whole. Decisions Fifa make can effect club football. At this point club football's 2022 season is completely fucked up. 

&gt;&gt; The sport has been living in corruption and it might finally have a light shining that corrects that.

&gt;Again, international football, not club football. And this corruption really hasn't affected games at all, it has been about where funds for grassroots football have gone to in developing countries. 

Yes but the decisions Fifa makes reflect football as a whole. It might not directly affect games but they do play a role with players schedules. They play a role as a figure head of the sport. So do you think that the 2022 World cup has no effect on Clubs at all? It's in the middle of the damn season. Chelsea has a lot of international players it's not like we only send one or two.

And being neutral whilst also encouraging careers means you have to encourage all careers, corporate and charity, public sector and private sector.

&gt;&gt; At this point club football's 2022 season is completely fucked up.

&gt;You do realise that lots of countries have seasons that run in calendar years, and not as the English season does? They have World Cups in the middle of their seasons and they seem to cope. 

You do realize those Clubs and leagues don't have 75% of the players in the world cup like big European Leagues right? Teams like Barcelona and Chelsea send near 15 plus players to the world cup. They won't have a team.  

&gt;&gt; Most of us don't care to watch people die trying to build stadiums. We don't want the sport to be full of corruption.

&gt;Give over, this has been happening in Qatar long before the World Cup bid, and it will continue happening after the World Cup and you won't give a shit then either. 

I give plenty of shits. And I'll continue to give a shit after the world cup is done. I think it's you who doesn't give a shit. And you're projecting that on everyone else. 

&gt;Were you complaining about ""corruption"" 10 years ago? Of course not, only as soon as the competition goes to Russia and the middle east does anyone start kicking off. 

People have been complaining about corruption since the 90s. And now we have reached a point where we can finally see it change. It's huge news for football. 

So the World Cup has no effect on Clubs? It doesn't take players from them? It doesn't play a role in scheduling? It doesn't share the image of football with clubs, fans, players?

Fair disclosure, I'm not a coaster designer/engineer, and my Physics is a bit rusty, but fundamentally we're talking about [Inertia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertia), which is the reason getting hit in the face by a 10g ball travelling at 5m/s hurts a lot less than getting hit by a 500g ball travelling at 5m/s. A heavier object is carrying more *energy* than a lighter object travelling at the same speed.

The hill chain will do more work in order to haul 2000kg of rider up than it will to haul 1300kg of rider up. That work is manifested in the train as Potential Energy (it's been raised up against gravity), which is then converted to Kinetic Energy as it descends under gravity.

In principle (in a perfect frictionless environment) a lighter cart should go as far as a heavier cart - the heavier cart descends harder, but also has to hump that weight back up uphill section of the loops and track features. Same as a [feather in a vacuum falling as fast as a hammer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E43-CfukEgs). In reality, the rolling friction and air resistance acting against a loaded train are more or less equal to that acting against an unloaded train, so the loaded train will carry speed better.

It won't necessarily be faster at the bottom of the first hill, but it will carry that speed better through the ride features if that makes sense (Cue Physics PhD explaining where my explanation is wrong/massively oversimplified!).

It's the same reason glider pilots carry water ballast - it helps them make way if they're flying into a headwind. If they need to lose weight to climb better in thermals they can dump it, but the extra mass allows them to punch into headwinds more effectively.",null,0,null,1433342607,null,0,1433343029,0,cru6b1x,null,t3_38casb,null,t1_cru6b1x,null,t1_cru53bx,null,null,null,1436693621,null,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7,null

Even Arsenal, who maintained being the form club, weren't playing more exciting than us.

The point of saying this is that we very well had a strong identity for a period of time. We very well played some of the best football in the league for a period of time. But no one gives a shit about that now because we went through a shorter period of time (8 matches) where an enormous amount of pressure was placed on our squad and we didn't handle it.

The only reason you could say we lacked an identity last season is because Rodgers was FORCED to change our formation. But we didn't stop being that pressing, fast counter-attacking side. We just didn't have Suarez or Sturridge at the end of it to make it look, TO YOU, like an identity.

But you're right, why our fans demand CL qualification as the only requirement of a manager, when we've got the wages where they are, is absolutely detached.

No one is saying stop targeting CL or the title. There will be plenty of the times when, with the fifth or even the sixth most wages or best squad, a team could qualify for CL or even win the league. We've got a lot of young talent. They could all grow together quickly before their contracts catch up to them and conceivably be one of the best ""squads"" in the league. 

However, no one should be ripping Rodgers head off for 5th. They should direct their anger at the club's investors, if anyone at all. And for anyone who cites the maulings or pathetic results in this past season as a result of why Rodgers must go, I can assure you that even the best managers (Mourinho, Wenger, etc) have experienced absolutely dreadful stretches when the media circus has gotten into the dressing room (as with the Sterling fiasco and Gerrard retirement train). 

Rodgers has a vision and, sure, I won't accept 5th in perpetua. But we can still claw CL next season. Fuck's sake if we can get some strikers scoring and staying healthy we could be in with a shout for the title because NO ONE was running away with it this year.

The closest I've heard to 'reliable sources' is the bloody Metro saying Juve are interested in him.

Chelsea had the least rotation of any squad in the premiership last year, a large part of our strength is how well drilled and disciplined we are. Cuadrado hasn't had a single run of games for the team - the closest we had was at the end of the season when he was playing better every game he played before he got injured in the final game of the season.

I have heard nothing about him being unsettled, nothing about Mourinho wanting to sell him. I wish some of the fans here weren't so incredibly short-sighted in wanting to sell him - De Gea and Ivanovic both had pretty poor starts to their respective top-club careers, and Mourinho clearly likes him and his defensive workrate or else he wouldn't have signed him.

Give him a pre-season, a chance to hit the gym and get to gel with the squad for a bit. Give him a run of games.

Every modern/progressive movement that is brought up in the north is shot down by unionists.  They hold the north back and eventually, when people are completely fed up (even their fleg loving will give in the face of really harsh economics) they will realise that Ireland is a better place to be apart of.

Ireland doesn't have a domain like London governing the country which serves the interest of the minority.  If people want to be progress as a society you are gonna have to ditch unionism.

As you do not have the item, you have lost out. Therefore, if you were able to find the exact same item (you have stated that this is unique and so this may be difficult) for a higher price, such as £200, then you are entitled to the difference between the price you would have paid (£100) and the price you paid after loosing out on the bargain (£200). In this example you would be entitled to £100 from the seller. However, if you find it cheaper than £100, then you are not entitled to any remedy. 

Hope this helps.

That's why I think it is a mistake to have this leadership election before the referendum. You could be alienating a lot of voters you will need for the general election, if you pick the wrong side. 

People are assuming the European Referendum is a slam-dunk just as they assumed the Scottish referendum was a slam-dunk. The Scottish situation shows that it was closer that people thought and Lab paid a heavy price because some voters wouldn't forgive their long-term stance.

Instead of saying ""I'll create a separate yes campaign"", the best strategy would be for a Labour leader to do a Harold Wilson and say ""I'll allow a free vote for MPs and members of the party"". Don't pin colours to either side.

P.S. Notice how Sturgeon is tying her party very closely to the EU, despite polls showing that Scots are more euro-sceptic than Londoners or the Welsh or people in the Midlands. She might get a shock in the referendum and there will be plenty of room for Labour rather than Conservatives to pick up those votes, provided Labour hasn't also tied it's colours to the same mast.",null,0,null,1433347138,null,0,1433347437,0,cru98ce,null,t3_38c71t,null,t1_cru98ce,null,t3_38c71t,null,null,null,1436695957,null,2,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,2,null

&gt;

&gt;__Betteridge's law of headlines__ is an [adage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adage) that states: ""Any [headline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headline) that ends in a [question mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark) can be answered by the word *no*."" It is named after Ian Betteridge, a British technology journalist.  

&gt;The maxim has been cited in anonymous compilations of variants of [Murphy's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_Law) under the title of ""__Davis' law__""   or the ""__journalistic principle__"",  and has been referred to in commentary as ""an old truism among journalists"" in 2007. 

&gt;British newspaper editor [Andrew Marr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Marr) made a similar observation in his 2004 book *My Trade*:

The problem is that since we're fifth best in the one metric that over time is the most accurate in predicting the table (wages), we don't have any leeway at all regarding those kinds of transfer mishaps.

In essence - we have to not just do 'ok' in our transfer dealings (I think the norm is around 40% of transfers are considered ""successful""). We have to overachieve compared to our competitors to compete. We couldn't afford to screw up in our striker purchase (and we've had absolutely no luck with Sturridge being injured either), but our competitors could well afford it (in particular the Manchester teams this season).

So rescheduling the entire season still equals zero effect on Clubs? And it has not been stated they will take a long winter break. Leagues like the PL don't even have a winter break. 

&gt;If you're concerned about corruption and human rights so much then you really should be focusing your efforts on more important issues than Qatar, the same thing happens in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. The US is still holding people without trial in Guantanamo Bay, Australia actually sterilises disabled people. 

All issues of human rights are important. I focus on all of them but at the moment this conversation is about Fifa and the human rights it is choosing to be blind too. It's not about those other human rights issue. Those are discussed on a different sub. They aren't about football. But they are equally important. 

&gt;I don't give a shit, but I never claimed that I did. 

And that makes you a terrible person. You should give a shit about humanity. 

&gt;You are jumping on a bandwagon only because there is a World Cup due to be held in Qatar. 

Oh please do continue to jump to conclusions. I don't care of the location. I just care about the people it effects. We shouldn't be ok with 1,000 people dead so we can watch the world cup. People shouldn't die for our amusement in a sport. Countries also shouldn't get the world cup through corruption. People shouldn't be illegally making millions. I stand against that.

Some times are better than others, though. Depends entirely on your local supermarkets, but for me, with my choices, it works like this:

* Tesco, at around 7pm. It's when they put the reductions out, and there's normally a few decent bargains to be had. 

* Asda, before 10pm. Beyond 10 and all the checkouts are closed and I have to use self-service, which I oppose, since it's exactly what enables them to operate without paying any checkout staff to be there. 

* Lidl, any time. They control their stock well, so there's no difference what time of the day I go.

* Aldi, generally as soon in the morning as possible. The fruit starts going off by lunchtime.

Just saying, though. It's not an 'incapacity' of considering anything good, it's a choice. Philosophers and the like have written extensive articles about what life's purpose is.

No it's a lack of preparedness, or FSG were complacent if they genuinely believed that Sanchez was a nailed on signing and nothing else mattered.

&gt;We couldn't afford to screw up in our striker purchase

That's exactly what we did when we failed to replace Suarez, surely following your logic we should have purchased two strikers to replace him to address the chance of one of them failing. But it should have been made clear that the ONE striker we did buy (Lambert was purchased as a 'Plan B' striker) wouldn't come close to replacing the player we sold, then surely it's the transfer committee's fault because purchasing players is the be all and end all of it's existence.

I think this will stand for any design/arts/media/'coursework' type degree programmes though.

At the beginning of your degree (and often at the beginning of each year) you're always given a tonne of paperwork, boring crap that most students will hang onto but never look at.

Within this paperwork is a course handbook/assessment guidelines.

Find it and read it. Read it until it's burned into your brain. Make notes on it. Analyse it to the point where you could recite it and variations of it to anyone who asks. 

This is your degree.

In your handbook/assessment guidelines it will be written right in front of you what you're being marked for. It essentially says everything you need to do to pass. 

Then it also tells you what level of work will up your grade. It tells you what reflects a 2:2 and then what you need to do to turn that into a 1:1.

Once you understand this, you can achieve the grade you want, it just means applying yourself in a different way to how you perhaps originally intended.

I discovered the assessment objectives in GCSE art, and I've since produced all my work by following the requirements. A* GCSE art and design, A at A level, distinction in foundation degree art and a 1:1 degree in illustration.

You're given this information so you know how to achieve your potential but nobody ever reads the booklets. And they're written in a pretty odd/complicated language a lot of the time but persevere with them and you'll fly through it.

If you have any other questions regarding them do feel free to ask, I'll help where I can.

null,false,DeusBex,null,null,null,"The Green Party aren't, from my knowledge of them anyway, quite so liberal as the Liberal Democrats. Do they adopt a liberal approach on many issues? Absolutely. However, unlike the Liberal Democrats, it is not at their very core. I think they'd quite quickly adopt an authoritarian stance, hypothetically speaking if they were in power, to push environmentalism for example. There are already some policies in which they are completely illiberal too, such as restricting the sale of on-flight alcohol as /u/nogdam pointed out.

There's also the sheer fact that, whilst the Green Party MPs do seem genuinely nice people, they're largely a party of idealists. They want a complete overnight push for environmentalism, a completely open-door immigration policy, and full immediate nuclear disarmament. It isn't that I disagree with their policies per se, but merely they speed with which they wish to achieve them, and also in some cases the means with which they go about them. In other words, if we want to be realistic, then the Liberal Democrats are certainly the more sensible party.

Finally, within the overall bracket of liberalism, there's economic and social liberalism: something not many people realise. The Greens are most definitely social liberals, promoting same-sex marriage and most things to do with equality for citizens, but at the same time it is really difficult to call them economic liberals - downright impossible even. They most certainly aren't for promoting the free market, as from what I've read of their policies they seem to be very keen on imposing tighter restrictions upon companies.

There is no formalised way to exit a multi academy trust but the school in question, MAT and the Secretary of State and would normally need to agree that is in the best interest that they leave. Then they'd have the funding agreement revised. So, the only way to leave is with their permission. Specifically, the sponsor's permission as they are allowed 8 governors of the board (with 2 parent and 2 staff) and thus dominate it.

Umbrella trust's on the other hand are a bit easier. They need 75% of the academy trust to vote in favour of them leaving, in order for them to *apply* for the Secretary of State to allow them to leave, then alter the financial agreement and leave.

No idea how you leave if you're a part of the 3rd type (a collaborative chain.) The Department has deliberately buried as much of this as they can, and it's not an easy process unless the Trust wants rid of you.

Firstly, while yes TECHNICALLY the lender has the right to possession from the moment the ink dries on the agreement (Four Maids Ltd v Dudley Marshall (Properties) Ltd) they are required by law to effect this possession peaceably, which simply cannot be done with the borrower in occupation, so yes, as you say, they will apply for a possession order. And if the borrower is not in arrears with pretty much no chance of paying back the sum owed in reasonable time (""Sum owed"" defined as the arrears upto court date - Halifax Building Society v Clark, ""reasonable time"" defined as anything upto the remaining life of the mortgage agreement - Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society v Norgan), they are HIGHLY likely to be granted a stay or adjournment (Administration of Justice Act 1970 - S8)

If they are in arrears without prospect of repayment, yes, a possession order will be granted. Which is merely a means to an end since the bank has no interest in possession of the property beyond the fact that having possession will allow them to exercise their power of sale more smoothly as they can sell vacant in possession. Once the property is sold, the bank may merely cover its own costs in lending the money, and in selling the property from the proceeds. It doesnt simply get to keep the balance should one exist, it goes back to the borrower (S105 - Law of Property Act 1925). Thats because it DOESNT OWN THE PROPERTY. It holds an interest.  

The lender does not own the legal title, the borrower does. The lender is granted legal interest in the property as security, and the rights which accompany that interest. 

Legal interests attract rights and powers which are enforceable per say and as such your idea that without ""Owning"" the property the lender can do nothing to enforce their security is laughable. 

Take a look at the Law of Property Act 1925, and the Law of Property Miscellaneous Provisions Act 1989 and get back to me.

""In the absence of an available market, the court requires damages to be computed on the basis of the loss directly and naturally resulting, in the ordinary course of events, from the buyer's breach of contract. Prima facie this means the difference, if any, between the contract price and the value of the goods to the sellers, of which any resale price obtained is a good, though not infallible, guide. Alternatively, the seller may recover any profit lost as a result of the non-acceptance, a useful resort in cases where goods are difficult to sell. But such loss must be proved to have resulted from the breach.""

The case it references are as follows:

Hopefully this provides further avenues of research. Sadly I'm not free to look through all of these in detail.

I should have toned down the title, but this is my first reddit post ever and I didn't know I can't edit the title.

We sort-of knew things were not going well in their couple, but my partner never noticed her friend behaving weirdly enough to justify a forced trip to hospital.

My partner have been able to visit her friend, with other friends too. Her friend claim the husband has been lying and/or deforming facts, and this is the only source of information we have for now :( She did have a talk with her doctors, but she's waiting for their feedback, without really nothing if there will be any.

It's unlikely we will get any information from the husband side obviously, although my partner met him at the hospital and he seemed quite angry. We also won't get much information from the hospital, because we are not family. But the family is in another country, so it's really frustrating.

I understand what you are saying about things not being like TV, and my partner's friend possibly really needing this. However, there had been some bad press about MHA 'errors' (http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/thousands-wrongly-sectioned-under-mental-health-act-following-technical-error-8231388.html, not sure how reliable is the source), so we are also worried about that.

Not only that, this is having an even worse effect on rental prices (at least near me).

If current prices are near on 2/3x what lenders are comfortable lending, this in theory means that rent is at least 2/3x more than it should be, which if you're young is even worse as you'll tend to earn below average wage anyway, and less likely to be able to afford the deposit needed for a house anyway.

So unless you have very understanding parents who don't mind you hanging around past 25 until you've saved up enough to get a mortgage, you're stuck renting, pissing away at least half what you earn alone on rent, leaving you very little left to pay bills, let alone actually put anything away into savings.

Unfortunately for Britton, Cork has been ruthlessly efficient so far and he's really left little to no room for Britton to step in. That said, I think this shows there is room for Britton on this team. He won't start, but he would be a great secondary option at that position. I reckon he could muster 10&lt; appearances next year in this role.

This puts the ball completely in Britton's court though. Would he prefer to spend his twilight years getting consistent play time? or transition into a coaching role while grabbing appearances here and there for his favoured club?

I can understand that from a certain point of view - the bank wants to protect their investment and so on. Mass default on mortgages was, as far as my limited understanding goes, one of the main reasons for the crash a few years ago. However it just isn't fair. It helps to prop up house prices, and  contributes to higher rents, which are already higher than mortgage costs anyway, got to pay off that landlords mortgage I suppose.

The number of assessments didn't really go up, but the quality and complexity did by an order of magnitude. 

In first year, a whole lot of my work was done 24-48 hours before the deadline, but come the late half of second year, and especially throughout 3rd year, You need at least a week to get the work done to a good standard. My grades have dropped a little over the years, first year was 67%, but both second year and the grades I've had so far in third year (60/120 credits) both keep me at 64%. 

My attendance is always pretty damn shitty, usually around the 60% mark for lectures, and I still leave everything until I have literally a few days to get my work done (my dissertation was done over 5 days... Not looking forward to that mark), and it's for those reasons I'm not getting a first.  

The answer is simple: Go to every lecture and do at least 10-15 hours a week of work outside of lectures, and you'll get the grade you deserve. That's only 2 or 3 hours a day, Monday to Friday. Weekends off.

The club is pretty sectretive at times). I was merely arguing that seeing that we are relatively poorer than our competitors that kind of mistake is much costlier for us than for them. This in turn means that as long as we do the same mistakes as them, we'll be punished harder (Falcao not working out is less costly than Balotelli not working out).

My main point was that ""The Underlying Problem"" is that we have less money, so we have to be smarter (which you've very correctly and succintly pointed out that we weren't last summer), and that last summers failure wasn't ""The Underlying Problem"", but a screw-up that was magnified by the financial disparity.

I'm not sure if changing our wage-structure would be a solution as long as our finances are as they are, and FFP exists, but that is another matter.

EDIT: And I in no way meant that wages are the be-all and end-all. We finished second last season! It's just that us doing exactly the same as the teams around us is not enough.

Now you know that AOB is 2/9 of the circle, you also know that that AB is 2/9 of the circumference, and to get the whole circumference you divide 12pi (AB) by 2, and then multiply by 9 to get 54pi as the total circumference.

Since we know that c=piD, we can substitute in the numbers to get 54pi = piD, which simplifies down to become 54 = D.

From there on it's plain sailing, as we add 54 to 12pi to get the final answer.

Circumference = pi X diameter ... 60pi = pi X ? ... 60pi/pi = 60.

null,false,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,null,"The point I was responding to was explicitly about the issue of the recommendation coming from a third-party.  This is, obviously enough, a valid point and an important one, since the case is often described as closer to, ""MPs vote themselves a huge pay-rise."".  However, if, ""It was proposed by an independent third-party."" is a valid argument in the one case, it's just a legitimate in the other.

On the issue of whether the government can **do** anything about it, about two years ago, Cameron threatened to disband IPSA , if they didn't back off on the huge pay rises they proposed for MPs.  **If** those proposals are as wrong as so many of the front-bench MPs have professed to think they are, then *(in this respect at least)* IPSA isn't fit for purpose.  If this is the case then action to correct them is not merely appropriate, but necessary.

Just to round out this bit, it's worth considering that unless you're willing to accept that the MPs' protestations about the pay rises are nothing more than deliberately weak, empty weasel words, it is broadly their opinion the pay rises for MPs are wrong.

Ok, moving onto cost...

Yep, fair point.  It would have cost a **lot** more to give nurses the extra 1%.  I don't have any better figures, so I'll accept your example estimate as feasible.

Firstly, if we're accepting the, 'There's **no** money!' austerity model that justifies suppressing nurses' pay, then there's no money for additional MPs' pay too.  Both figures are at once large sums of money and at the same time trivial in the scale of total government spending.

There's an argument here that, 'It won't cost a penny more!' which is something IPSA peddled.  This is true, but it's also extremely misleading.  The extra pay is proposed in lieu of all the expenses and benefits they lost.  So, fair point, the extra pay won't cost any more than the expenses and benefits they're losing.  The thing is, they're losing those expenses and benefits because they were abused.  The additional pay is broadly equivalent to a scenario where after Civil Service pensions were reformed, Civil Servants were given a huge pay bump to compensate for it.  

All that aside, if it were to be kept cost neutral there's a nearly endless list of other things that could be cut back to free up the money.  The cost of a single F-35 to go on the insanely over-expensive (£7bn) aircraft carriers is nearly £70m.  The last I saw the estimated cost of adding catapults and traps to that same aircraft carrier was over £1bn.  *(Although my recollection is that BAE have to eat half the cost, it's still £500m!)*  We could shave it off the £12bn we fritter away on foreign aid, since while it's nice to give to charity, it's profoundly stupid to borrow on your credit card to do so.  Although it's a small'ish slice of the £100m, the cost of keeping Julian Assange holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy is about £2m a year.

&amp;nbsp;



The friendship was forged over three decades ago during Borussia's glory days of the 1970s when they were at the peak of their powers and met Liverpool three times.
&amp;nbsp;



The first of which was in the 1973 UEFA Cup final, with the Reds prevailing 3-2 on aggregate to lift the trophy.
&amp;nbsp;



They met again in the never-to-be-forgotten 1977 European Cup final in Rome, and of course Liverpool were once again victorious to win the first of our famous five.
&amp;nbsp;



The following year, they went head-to-head in the semi-final of the 1978 European Cup. Liverpool lost the first leg 2-1 at the Rhine Stadium in Dusseldorf, but emphatically ran out 3-0 winners in the Anfield return.
&amp;nbsp;



It was during these matches supporters of both clubs struck up friendships which have lasted to the present day.
&amp;nbsp;



I personally believe that the main reason for the affinity both sets of fans have for each other is also because Liverpool and Moenchengladbach are both working-class cities and they can, therefore, identify with each other. Also, the Borussia supporters are as passionate about their club as the LFC supporters are about ours.

&gt;whether that transpires into nationalists votes is yet to be seen, but most likely

Shinners have been saying that for decades and it hasnt turned into any noticeable vote change. The unionist vote has stayed at 50% share since 1997 while the protestant population has decreased. The nationalist vote has stayed and dipped below 40% since 1997 even though the catholic population has increased. You're very delusional if you believe this ""demographic change"" the shinners rely on. 


https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Northern_Ireland_Census_Religion.png


Between 2001 and 2011 the catholic population rose its overall percent share by 1% of the NI population on top of natural change. This works out as 18 000 people . (assuming ni has a population of 1.8 million) Now lets look at what happened between 2001 and 2011. First thing in my head is the EU expansion in 2004.  The polish population in NI is estimated at 20 000 to 30 000. Thats the pole population alone if i added in Lithuanian,Romanian and the other 2004 expansion countries it would be much more. All those countries are over 90% catholic. Thus helping the increase of the catholic population in NI. Now how many republican Lithuanians have you met? Cant say I've encountered many myself. Throughout 2001 to 2011 when the protestant population decreased but the unionist vote had had no dramatic change and has even increased. 

What you're completely ignoring is the ""other"" and ""non stated"" category. Many protestants are defecting to these at a higher rate than catholic hence why the ""other"" category has a 55% british identity and only a 14% irish identity. Now why catholics are more loyal than protestants is down to the priests but its clear to see from the 2011 census that many people of protestant heritage have abandoned their faith but kept their British idenity. In fact the 0-15 age range has a higher british identity % share than the age range above it. Showing that a british identity is stronger in 0-15 year olds than 16-24 year olds. So no your ""demographic change"" you latching on to is a myth unless Polish people are now nationalists.

OK....

&gt; Firstly, while yes TECHNICALLY the lender has the right to possession from the moment the ink dries on the agreement (Four Maids Ltd v Dudley Marshall (Properties) Ltd)

Contradicting your first point...

&gt; they are required by law to effect this possession peaceably,

Which describes how they go about it...

&gt; which simply cannot be done with the borrower in occupation,

the 'peaceably' bit, not the repossession bit.

&gt; so yes, as you say, they will apply for a possession order. And if the borrower is not in arrears with pretty much no chance of paying back the sum owed in reasonable time (""Sum owed"" defined as the arrears upto court date - Halifax Building Society v Clark, ""reasonable time"" defined as anything upto the remaining life of the mortgage agreement - Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society v Norgan), they are HIGHLY likely to be granted a stay or adjournment (Administration of Justice Act 1970 - S8)

So now you're quoting law at me like this is some kind of court room and, doubtless you are probably qualified in some way (but way too underpaid to be spending all this time debating an anonymous person on reddit instead of working on real cases) - however everything you are now saying is negated by the fact that you are trying to use a very long and drawn out legal argument to admit I'm right but in such a way as it appears I'm wrong.

Yawn.

&gt; If they are in arrears without prospect of repayment, yes, a possession order will be granted.

Contradicting your first point again...

&gt; Which is merely a means to an end since the bank has no interest in possession of the property beyond the fact that having possession will allow them to exercise their power of sale more smoothly as they can sell vacant in possession.

Ummm... yes.

&gt; Once the property is sold, the bank may merely cover its own costs in lending the money, and in selling the property from the proceeds.

Let's just remember they don't own the house, but they are selling it now and they are no longer living in it.... right?

&gt; It doesnt simply get to keep the balance should one exist, it goes back to the borrower (S105 - Law of Property Act 1925). Thats because it DOESNT OWN THE PROPERTY. It holds an interest.

Oh you were doing so well until you went ALL CAPS... you neglected to mention that if the bank doesn't recoup the cash from the sale - the ~~borrower~~ sorry, 'owner' is on the hook for the difference.

&gt; The lender does not own the legal title, the borrower does. The lender is granted legal interest in the property as security, and the rights which accompany that interest.

At what point during the sale does the ""owner"" cease becoming the owner? Admit it, we're just arguing about semantics now.... you're trying to draw out an argument on finer points of the law just to avoid using the word ""owner"" - we're on Reddit FFS - this isn't a trial, you're responding to a facetious throw-away comment. It doesn't make you look smart, it makes you look like a blowhard.

&gt; Legal interests attract rights and powers which are enforceable per say and as such your idea that without ""Owning"" the property the lender can do nothing to enforce their security is laughable.

Wait... what? Isn't the whole point of your dick-waving to prove this is the case? I'm pretty much stating as a fact that simply ""Owning"" the property doesn't mean you simply ""Own"" it.

&gt; Take a look at the Law of Property Act 1925, and the Law of Property Miscellaneous Provisions Act 1989 and get back to me.

No, because I'm not a lawyer trying argue a case here - your legal posturing is laughable.",null,0,null,1433354820,null,0,false,0,cruecf0,null,t3_38cc7r,null,t1_cruecf0,null,t1_crubhd6,null,null,null,1436699178,null,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1,null

Almost none of them can vote in GEs because they're non-british/irish EU citizens so it doesn't matter but when it comes to identity, everyone born out side the uk and ireland consider themselves 24% British,11% irish,8.5% northern irish,66.5% other (most definitely their home country). Remember that NI is a small country so the sample size is very small to make definite predictions. Its not what the current generation of foreigners that matter as most of them will pick their home nation as their national identity. Its what their children identify as that matters

Parking a car for days on end will be an extremely expensive endeavour. I think Q-Park round the corner on Leith Street is £17 per day.

My advice; find somewhere cheap to park on the edge of town and bus the rest. If you're only staying for three nights, you can park your car free overnight out at the Hermiston Gait Park &amp; Ride, which has plenty of buses that serve the streets adjoining Waterloo Pl (I would recommend taking the 25, the fastest of the buses that serve Hermiston P&amp;R, which stops at Waverley Station). Bear in mind though this is unsecured parking.

If longer than 3 days, maybe see if you can get a discount rate at parking near the airport or something along these lines.

As for German history being so shit compared to ours, let me run you through some of our recent history in brief. This is missing out so much, these are just the events in the past 150 years or so, that have some comparison to the Holocaust. There are loads more points to be made.




We were one of the first countries to create concentration camps, in the Boer Wars. In the second war, 10% of the Boer population was killed in just one year including 22,000 children. There was further discrimination against black Africans (who weren't even considered to be hostile at the time!), roughly 20,000 of whom were worked to death in camps. 48,000 civilians were killed by the British in this war.





The Amritsar massacre in 1919, between 400-1000 peaceful protesters were killed. The man responsible became known as the saviour of India for his actions there.



The Calcutta famine is more contentious - it's hard to say how bad it would have been without the British involvement. However, it's certain that Britain used completely inaccurate facts willingly to justify not sending help to the region and the overall attitude towards the Indian subcontinent reflects this. Governors were encouraged to be as ""efficient"" as possible (read: starve the population). Efforts to help the Indian population were stifled, even punished. 



More definite is the involvement in the Irish famine. Not only did the government at the time give less than 4 times less money to help Ireland as it gave compensation to slave traders and owners for the loss of their slaves, grain prices were maintained at an artificially high level, in the belief that the market would solve the problems. At best, the government were simply inept. At worst, not only were they politically weak, they were motivated by religious and racial hate - both of which are easily evidenced.





Then there's all the mess of us leaving our colonies, which I simply don't have space to cover all of. 



The partitioning of India to create Pakistan is the root of almost all problems between the two countries and Muslim-Hindu-Sikh tensions being exacerbated. There was widespread torture of people supporting, or just living in the same area as people supporting independence in Malay, Iraq and Cyprus. The Iraqi campaign was almost certainly the worst of these three, with entire villages burned to the ground. In Kenya, concentration camps were set up in the 50s due to fear of rebellion. 1.5 million people were sent to these, and forced to work, and faced torture and rape. These were almost all civilians, with no direct links to the Mau Mau group who were rebelling. 





Even more telling are the justifications for the atrocities in the concentration camps, ""they're just lazy, they need to work"" ""they're an inferior race"" are the two common themes in quotes I've read, and the covering up and utter ignorance in Britain. The atrocities committed by Germany were some of the worst ever to occur, but at least there's education about it. Over here, our media lies about, or ignores these events to further their own agendas. This misinformation has been to the point where the conditions in Kenya were lied about in the house of commons repeatedly. There is little to no acceptance of the faults of our country in the past.





Moving away from seeing how shit some of our history is, why do the actions of people who lived in the same country as you take away your right to criticise another country's actions? No one can be culpable for the actions of someone before they were born, and it's not as if Germany denies the Holocaust, or does anything other than teach about how bad it was, so we can hardly call them hypocrites.",null,0,null,1433355862,null,0,false,0,cruf1ny,null,t3_38e0oy,null,t1_cruf1ny,null,t1_crucbcc,null,null,null,1436699712,null,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8,null

Most people would agree that those interests align with public interest *most* of the time, but these bodycams are particularly needed for when they *don't* align. If there's an accusation of foul play against the police, then there are plenty of opportunities for footage to be mis-represented or just 'lost'.

I'd set these bodycams up such that they sit proudly on the chest and have a small blue light when recording. The blue light clearly demonstrates to the public that footage is being recorded. Officers would have the ability to suspend recording for a few minutes at a time (for toilet breaks, etc.), but other telemetry such as GPS and accelerometer data would continue.

Each camera should record to unremovable local backing storage in fifteen second segments. Each segment would be encrypted using the public keys of the police, the courts and the ICO. To decrypt any particular segment of time, a warrant would be required and the private key of any two of the three encryptors. At the end of each shift bodycams would be kept in the police station to charge, and to upload their day's footage to diverse and *independent* locations, where they would be kept for some time.

This works for everyone. I'm sure the police would appreciate the fact their commanding officers can't snoop on their day-to-day trips to Dunkin Doughnuts, and the public can feel confident that there's a decent and respectful data retention and usage arrangement.

Then you have outer Birmingham which is lovely, nice houses, parks, good transport links &amp; eating out but not much in the way of nightlife. Housing can be affordable but again varies depending on where you move too &amp; type of property. Birmingham also has a lot more too offer with brilliant things to do within the city &amp; surrounding it. There are events &amp; things to do happening throughout the year such as the famous German market (biggest in Europe) &amp; music &amp; food festivals in the summer. Birmingham is also close to Shakespeare's country, historic Warwick &amp; Coventry, Dudley &amp; Telford home of the iron bridge. I could go on about the benefits but I'd be here for ever!

Stop thinking of the NHS as a loss maker. Look at it in comparison of what we get. Stop trying to run it as a patient centric system. 

Look it's simple. You want your teeth seen? Go see a dentist. Dentist not here? You are going to have to travel a bit. We cannot put services everywhere. 

Too much emphasis has been placed on patient satisfaction rather than outcomes. So a patient may be happy the staff are nice to them and the room is super cool but it may be better for the patient to be told to get up and walk. This would reduce DVT and Bed Sores in post operative care but patients would be rather more irritated that the surgeon INSISTS they walk just after they have had major surgery. 

To put it into perspective? I work in rural healthcare in India. I am allowed to tell my patients to do this. I have seen in the past 9 months... just 5 cases of bed sores. 4 were because the patient was at home where the patient's family didn't move the patient. And one was because they had to remain in spinal traction and could not move.

Patients may not be as satisfied with this as with a doctor who lets them lie in bed. But outcomes are cheaper. 

Secondly? We need to realise we have to spend money on this. We cannot fix our roof with blu-tack and expect it to hold. 

We need  to realise that the NHS is at its core a system that helps everyone. 

1. We enjoy unparalleled access to amazing healthcare. Sometimes  we have to wait.  Waiting is not bad. I repeat, waiting is not bad. That's the small price to pay for everyone to have access

2. This means that we are more healthy than most. We need a greater emphasis on cheap prevention too which is something we lack. 

3. This means a healthier workforce. Means less days off and losses as such. Means fewer disabilities. 

In short? It's a big big boost to our economies. It allows small businesses to keep hold of workers and allows low wage workers a higher standard of health than otherwise possible.  

In exchange we pay more tax and we have to use it sensibly. 

It is sustainable. What it needs is sensible investment. We need to increase the wage bill. We need to look at what hospitals need, not force them to hit a target that may or may not sensible. We need to streamline some services. This means cutting ones that aren't used all that much and/or patients having to make some sacrifices in terms of expecting to be treated like a private hospital all the time. In some places you are going to have to wait. 

The GP system needs more doctors and nurses.

The doctors and nurses pay needs to go up at least adjusting for inflation and increase in job requirements. You cannot keep asking us to do more and more on the same salary. We are in a situation where we cannot get enough doctors and nurses into the system as the pay isn't good and the work is too much. And we are discussing removing EU working hour directives and forcing staff into even worse working conditions without realising that this is precisely why events like North Staffordshire happened! Overworked, Underappreciated, Underpayed Staff don't really give a fuck.  It's the same with Tesco as it is with the NHS.  You screwing over your staff means they don't want to go the extra mile. 

Remove targets and performance based incentives. All this has done is made people worry about hitting targets. Instead pay us appropriately then review performances and seek to improve. 

Investment is necessary but sensible investment. 

I may have a suggestion. Bring back the old perks of Junior Doctors. Cheap/Free on site accommodation. Subsidised food. Make their lives cheaper so they can save more. Improve public transport links. I would allow private ties if you can do things like ""Hospital Staff Buses"". A local bus company provides a couple of buses on a high traffic route for hospital staff. Save us a bit of cash, good advertising for the bus company and good will. 

We need to start thinking way outside the box on how to keep the system working. We cannot expect the NHS to be the same in a changing world. Nor can we simply ditch it.

I believe the coasters at Alton Towers are effectively ""re-certified"" by an independent company on an annual basis during the off-season. Obviously the maintenance teams have their daily checks, and probably take carts in and out of service for weekly or monthly inspection and maintenance. The structural integrity of the coaster as a whole should not be in doubt - it's not going to rust through in 8 months if it's passed it's last closed-season inspection.

The rebuild process on mobile rides means they have the *potential* to be safer, but it also introduces the *potential* for something to be missed since it's being rebuilt so frequently (as opposed to a static build where every stage of the build is signed off by engineers, contractors, etc, etc).

Same goes for Gerrard in our title challenge season last year..he was continually referred to as a DM, when in fact he was just our lowest lying midfielder. Watch the difference between the play styles of Lucas and Allen when they play, Allen gets on the ball and looks to link play in midfield and keep possession, whereas as Lucas gets rid of it fast. Off the ball then they can be quite similar, but often times there is a midfielder next to Allen to cover gaps. On the other hand Lucas moves across in front of the backline and doesn't advance all that much to close down players. He also typically plays without another midfielder next to him.

With regards the diamond, I understand where you're coming from but out of all the players you've named only Coutinho is a conventional AM. There is now reason at present to design a formation to accommodate Lallana, Ibe or Markovic. No doubt they are 3 good players and could be brilliant for us going forward, but I think Rodgers is either going to attempt a diamond 442 (narrow and wide both possible) or a 4231. Its high time he's actually brought in a proper system and style. The 352 didn't shower us in glory at the back end of the year, and even when it was working, we couldn't score for our lives.

We need to all understand this is a squad game, and just because we're linked to a player, or just because a player got a lot of game time last year doesn't mean they'll play a lot next year. I imagine Rodgers playing a back 4, Can and Hendo in mid, Milner and Sterling wide, with Coutinho behind Sturridge. Then the likes of Lallana can swap in and out on the wings or centrally, and Markovic and Ibe can rotate on the wings. If we play a diamond we can play Sterling as a 2nd striker if it's a narrow diamond and then the formation can morph into a 433, with Sterling and either Coutinho or Milner going wide, and the other dropping into a midfield 3.",null,0,null,1433357411,null,0,false,0,crug2pq,null,t3_38d5go,null,t1_crug2pq,null,t1_crub4ed,null,null,null,1436700338,null,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null

You can see the development and progression in my grading from my experience. First year was stimulating, but a bit overwhelming, as it was quite a significant jump from A Levels. I lacked a lot of crucial skills. The reason I progressed was: my quality of English dramatically improved, I developed a better knowledge of how to write a solid essay/dissertation, had a higher level of motivation, I learned how to better organise myself and be more efficient. 

Third year was probably slightly more difficult, only because of the dissertation/independent research expected of you. I think it's also a bit of a hit-and-miss in getting the right module that you can confidently excel in.

&gt;For comparison’s sake, the NFL earns about $3 billion per year from its television deal, while the NBA will take in about $2.66 billion per year when its new television deal begins in the 2016-17 season.

&gt;EPL teams, obviously, are thrilled. As the Guardian reports, even the league’s last-place team will receive around $152 million annually, while the champion should rake in about $240 million.

Also, quite apart from simple vocabulary, I understand that learning it at an early age is a good preparation for learning other languages, and at the same time the student is  becoming familiar with terms from professions such as medicine and law.

But I'm far from expert, other people are in a much better position to argue for it than me.

But the court (or jury) won't strike down your defence because it is bad law, but because they won't believe you.

There's a [notable rape case on this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPP_v_Morgan) from the 70s where the defendants were convicted of rape but appealed on the grounds that the trial judge ruled that they had to have a reasonable belief that the victim consented, not merely a genuine one. It went to the House of Lords and they ruled that the judge had been wrong; it was sufficient to show that they'd genuinely believed she had consented (the law has since changed) *but* the court still upheld their convictions on the basis that no reasonable jury would believe their stories.

But in your exploding police officer example [I wonder how many flags this comment will set off] if you could raise evidence to support your belief, that might be a different matter.

I don't think it's bad to make comparisons, but the comparisons should always be made with with the assumptions they make visible. For example if you have a recession based around oil prices dropping, it makes no sense to say a country with 1% of their exports being oil recovered better than a country with 99% of their exports being oil. 

Data should never be created to try and prove a point. If you set out to prove ""The Tories have failed in their economic recovery efforts"" then you will be able to find financial data that supports that. The question is whether it's a good measure at all, or if it's only being used to support a particular agenda. 

&gt;It has also been one of the worst recoveries for 200 years (comparing with our own past economic disasters).

Again, you can't make that comparison without considering confounding factors. Is this recession the same as the others you're comparing it to? Was it better or worse? Is our GDP the same? Was it a national or international recession? Were we booming before the recession or at average levels?  


I guess my point is if your aim is to find graphs that make austerity look bad you won't have much trouble, just as I can show you plenty of graphs that make austerity look good (have you seen what our deficit looks like now compared to pre-recession Labour?).

From what i've read/commented your main issue with allowing transfer news to be posted is that it ""clutters"" the sub-reddit. I've said a few times that it's the summer and it's not easy to clutter up a sub-reddit where not much else is being posted and it seems to be the general consensus of most other people on here. Some people like them and I personally like the idea of a rumour round up as well where all of the current rumours can be summarised and discussed for people who missed them initially but I still don't agree with the excuse of deleting the separate posts. The problem isn't that we have these threads, but that the separate posts which are new get removed and then missed. Despite the threads being regular there are still plenty of posts being missed, like the Cuadrado one posted several times last night and then being removed despite 20+ comments on them. The only place it has been left is in yesterdays mega thread where it was buried at the bottom.

It was stated that we would see how the stickied mega-threads go previously and by the looks of it most people aren't happy so can we settle this now?

I'm going to disagree. Graduate students are far more likely to enroll in a course at their home institution than at a distant one, primarily because their first exposure to their research area of interest will have been during the course of their undergraduate studies under their future supervisor. 

Employers are unlikely to care whether you switched departments between undergraduate and postgraduate study. Most employers wont care if you have a PhD, and those that do will be interested in what you achieved, not where you lived. 

This changes a bit in postdoctoral research. Generally it's good to build up a portfolio and show that you've worked in some good research groups under supervisors with big names. If you want to go far in academia then it's a good idea to move around, but that's only really applicable at postdoctoral level.

That is, there is not much interaction between the fielders on most plays.  As such, both offense and defense in baseball are highly individualistic.  

Also, your understanding of a manager's role in influencing the game is highly inflated and reflects how people understood baseball decades ago.  Perhaps you should update your understanding before criticizing others.

Sorry, that's a bit ambiguous. Are you saying they were ops trained within a couple of months of starting on Smiler, or of starting in the Park entirely?

Just I have family who have worked there and generally reckoned you needed 2-3 seasons to go Ops. Not on a specific ride, but general ride experience - for instance one worked 2 seasons hosting in Forbidden Valley. They needed an op on Mine Train so had him do a few weeks hosting that and then ops trained him - yeah, he only hosted for a month, but had 2 seasons of hosting multiple other rides prior to that. Obviously with a new ride there are no experienced hosts, because it's new, so you look to transfer in operators from other major rides, and also bring in experienced hosts to host it, and they'll be first in line for the second wave of Operator training.

And yes, obviously Hosting is different to Operating, that's why the jobs are not interchangeable and you require additional training to Operate.

the guy has that ""it"" factor where he can literally create something out of nothing...all the time. i've never seen a guy who was more inventive on a pitch, who was willing (and capable of pulling off) different moves to beat defenders, stump keepers, etc. 

i still think one of my favorite luis moments was the goal against spurs where he was played a ball from the left wing in from the edge of the box on the ground and he just dinked in near post with the outside of his right foot past lloris. or his newcastle goal where he chested down the ball, beats keep and taps home. just incredible awareness, confidence, and brilliant guy to be on a team. his passion is infectious, and if not for some moments of madness, he would without reasonable doubt be recognized as the 3rd best player in the world currently. 

the evra situation still irritates me because i don't know that he had a bad bone in his body when he said what he said, but yet he said something. he gets 8 match ban and terry gets a slap on the wrist. the ivanovic situation i understand the reason you ban him, but 10 games seems so high...but it's a repeat incident. and the chiellini ban was borderline inhumane. at least let the guy practice with the team. what's wild is it almost helped barca because he is now extremely fresh because he got rest after the long season/world cup. 

i hope he wins the treble this year. it's exactly what he wanted. and he is a major part of that barca team too. i know the way he tried to leave us sucked, but understanding from his perspective is good too. he ended up making the correct decision and paid the price briefly, but he gave us one hell of a run. i mean shit, the best game probably watching him was the game against united where he literally delivered kuyt a hattrick in a pizza box....love him",null,0,null,1433362532,null,0,false,0,crujjqy,null,t3_38efry,null,t1_crujjqy,null,t1_cruj0xn,null,null,null,1436702769,null,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6,null

What skills do you have?
Do you see yourself ever returning to university?

I know exactly how you feel here. I completed my degree an then realised that even though I got the best degree I could, it was in a field that is virtually non-existent outside of self employment.

I worked in retail throughout college and university and then in the same shop for 3 years after graduation. Totalling 8 years in a retail environment, like you said, it's alright at first, then the management changes start and then you begin to hate everything and everyone.
It's always said that you enter retail as Spongebob but you leave as Squidward. 

If you could answer the questions at the top, that would help. Really your job isn't so much about what you like as it is what you're good at.

Your career will always need to be a mix of what you enjoy and what you don't mind so much doing. Not to be a downer but it's unrealistic to expect to find a job that is always perfect for you.

You mentioned you used to enjoy your current work before changes were made. What did you enjoy about it? If you can work that out then try mixing that with what interests you in your free time and you might find a career path that way.

I work in a train station ticket office. It's only a temporary job and yet I'd be satisfied if this was my career. I applied for this job because I was applying for literally every available job going where I live. I had absolutely no interest in trains and I didn't find the job description interesting at all. Training for the job was fucking boring and I wanted to quit. Once I got into the job I loved it. I love working in an environment that is so integral to so many people because it makes you feel like you've accomplished something when everything goes right. I love the customer service aspect of the job. I speak to 50+ people a day. Some are nice, some aren't-it keeps the job interesting. Sometimes I will plan cross-country journeys for people and whilst doing so they will tell me about their lives and what they're doing, it's fascinating. Even when the trains are fucked and all I'm doing for a whole 9 hour shift is refunds after refunds and telling people why they're going to be late for their absolutely crucial jobs I intrinsically find satisfaction in my job as I make a difference. I never thought I'd like the job and the fact that I'll be handing in my notice in 3 months is making me genuinely sad.

My whole point was that there weren't any players who we passed up that were rumoured to be going anywhere - you've picked four forwards that didn't transfer anywhere, quite possibly because they weren't up for sale and/or they're happy where they are.

And for the likes of Lacazette there'd have been no guarantee that he'd have ended up the striker he did - we could just have easily have bought him off the back of a decent but not amazing season to find he's another Aspas. Don't think anyone would say it was obvious that a player who had scored 28 league goals over three seasons in Lyon's first team would then manage to bang in 27 in just one. Last summer Balotelli had scored 26 league goals in 43 games in the previous two seasons in comparison to 18 in 67 for Lacazette. 

After all, if players like Lacazette were such an obvious signing 12 months ago and Lyon would have sold, why did nobody else pick him up? Why did Man Utd go for Falcao? (and I'd note here if we'd signed Falcao instead of Balotelli most of our fans would have been jizzing themselves over it and yet we'd probably still be in the same shit place now). Why did City go for Bony? For the same reasons that we went for Balotelli - Lacazette was either not rated by anyone, not for sale, or both. 

Last summer was a cock-up, but I think it's bollocks to go back in hindsight and analyse who we could have picked up on the assumption that we had perfect scouting/clairvoyance, *and* that everyone was available to be signed *and* that they'd want to come if we went for them.

This isn't any old regeneration he's just come through: it's the first of a whole new set of regens (granted by the TL's because Clara pleaded on the Doctor's behalf in S7), a kind of re-set of the whole series to an update of much earlier DW eps where he was still new at this (and eagerly ready to bash in the brains of an innocent stone age man, if you remember).  

So this is all new and frightening territory for him; scared people usually don't do whimsy well and aren't primed for fun, but Moffat wanted to give this new start its full weight by not just breezing past a really big marker in the Doctor's history (a new set of lives *when in fact 11 had been expecting to die*).  So we get in on the ground floor with the S8 episodes: we see the Doctor positioned to try on different selves -- the madman/idiot in DB, but also the man who can best Half-Face; a moon-explorer in an SF story that's also fantastic (KtM); a guy who can lead a team in a sort of commando raid; someone who in a world of legend that just might be more like his own world than he'd like; someone who can use others, but also can knows how and when to step back and let others lead; and so on.  He's learning his strengths and weaknesses as he goes along, and we're on that challenging course with him throughout S8.

Moffat's said this himself in interviews; also that CapDoc is more confident now that S8, a shaky existential crisis, is over; and that S9 will have happier adventures, more fun, and more Doctorly self (though IMO Clara's prominent role here was crucial, as she worked through her own crises about what she wants from her life, and what she can and can't have).  I also trust Moffat, and I'd suggest you dig in and enjoy seeing *the making* of CapDoc as a self-aware, confident, bold character with warm hearts that can get him into deep trouble -- or perhaps his self-discovery, and the establishment of how he sees himself -- through S8; then you'll be fully prepared for the new man in S9, because I think that's going to happen.

I also trust Capaldi, who's phenomenal in this role, even in its narrower, darker S8 unfolding.  If nothing else, *watch him closely* as you go through the eps.  This guy has an amazing battery of resources at his command, from an unusually expressive face and voice, to a body-build that even *looks* a bit alien and that he uses masterfully, to a powerful intensity that he puts on with his Doctor outfit (to judge by a certain happy-go-lucky air about the actor off-set), to a great sense of gesture and pictorial image -- he's quoted somewhere as liking the idea of wearing black as the Doctor because of the power a black outfit gives the wearer to create striking and expressive images -- silhouettes against a light background, that pale face and hair emerging from the blackness on a dark set, etc.  And Jenna Coleman's Clara springs to lively and passionate life to match him.  If the story doesn't entirely grab you, *watch* what these actors are doing with their lines etc., and you can just be astonished by their level of craft and chemistry if nothing else, until the deeper levels of what they're portraying open up to you.  Part of your dismay could be *because* Moffat and Capaldi and Coleman deliberately depart in S8 from the lighter, more playful (although sometimes somber) tone and pace of Smith's era, to really ground this new Doctor in hard-earned self-knowledge. In S8, he's a hero of the ""dark night of the soul"" -- the fearful gulf of self-doubt and the challenge of piecing yourself back together again in some workable configuration that you can accept. The point is to retake solid ground where he can feel steady enough to let the whimsy and the fun fly again (although that's on offer in S8 too, as you'll find as you go through).  I think you'll want to be there when S9 kicks off.",null,0,null,1433365025,null,0,false,0,crul7rl,null,t3_38bx8e,null,t1_crul7rl,null,t1_cruae0h,null,null,null,1436704168,null,7,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,7,null

We really are being yanked onto a different level here, in order to step back up into the light with S9, I think, and the more closely you look S8 without expectations clouding your perception, the more this clearly this comes through.  Myself, I am pretty amazed at the daring of the creative team in taking on literally remaking the Doctor into his new self over a whole story arc; and I think re-watching is the key to that daring paying off for viewers who came to S8 not expecting such a bold and challenging departure.

I was quite confused on this question and I went for the isoline option. But I now think it may be a topography styled map. What did you put and what do you think? I know it is a one mark question but still...

The reason I ask being that if you have an interest in IT, you could do a course in development or coding and find an entry level IT job which would have the potential to move up a career path.

Companies are falling over themselves to find new IT people, and it's a well paid area, but you have to be interested in it.

If not, think of all the jobs that involve fixing things with computers, there are jobs in schools, offices etc, anywhere that has an abundance of computers usually needs a guy to fix things when they break.

Also think about how your ability to quickly pick things up with hardware might be useful in an engineering environment or you might have the right mental approach to work as an electrician or, at the other end of the spectrum, something in events, where they need things putting together quickly and at short notice, and for faults to be found and fixed as fast as possible.

Try and write a list of things you're good at, things you're trained/educated in, your skills and jobs where each of these things might be useful.

Don't forget things as simple as being confident at approaching customers etc are skills.

It's a shame the people running the club think so short term.  I think the board have been overspending on the basis they believe they can pay all the debts back with the Prem/Europe money and that's why they're so keen on promotion. Or failing that tap the support up for some more cash.

I think as supporters of Scottish Football, it's the Rangers' fans we feel a bit sorry for, putting their hands in their pockets to buy shares, season tickets and merc when players aren't performing as they should and the money men/management/directors attempt to line their pockets. Looking at it objectively, that's not right.

I'll be honest, I think Rangers may fold and we'll see an FC Rangers* type scenario ran by fans, for the fans. I don't suppose that would be the worse thing in the world for the fans - maybe better in a lot of ways?

null,false,tom808,null,null,null,"Your experience of A levels sounds very similar to mine.

When I went to 6 form I really tried hard for the first 6 months. I was getting good marks and making progress. Then the university pushing came alone. Personal statement writing, tutors asking people if they have their UCAS applications sorted. It was a nightmare for me because I had literally no idea what I wanted to do.

Two incidents which determined my choice of not going to university came to mind. We had a guest lecturer come in to talk about university and what university life was like. He said very clearly at the end of the talk that university was not for everyone and if you didn't know what you wanted to do then you shouldn't go. Simple as.

This contrasts horribly with my second story. My tutor was, as I mentioned above, always pushing pushing everyone to go to university. Like they are on some sort of sales commission for it. I remember I was in a tutorial and we were all writing personal statements and I was going to apply to do pharmacy. Now, don't get me wrong, I love science and really enjoyed chemistry put I was choosing pharmacy purely because it was related to subjects I was studying. Not because I wanted to get an actual career in it. So there I was being told to write a personal statement to convince a university admissions officer of why I wanted to do a course which I really wasn't sure was for me. So I made my decision there and then. I wasn't going.

That meant I was the black sheep of the class and the bad one. The one that had no interest in university after 6 form and therefore it was as if I was working for a company and I had just handed my notice in. I got a bit depressed. My grades dropped and I finished my two years there was 3 E's at A level. Top stuff.

So I looked for an apprenticeship. I wanted to get into being an electrician because I knew a sparky. He was really high up in his company and he got to do loads of really cool things like install massive advertising signs at football stadiums and the like. He earned good money and was a cool guy. I wanted his job. Unfortunately getting an apprenticeship at 18 was not exactly a done deal by any means. When I applied you had to get onto a college course (that was the easy part, you just apply) and you had to find an employer to take you on.

I didn't find an employer.

I wrote a covering letter and sent me CV to over 50 local electrical companies and heard back from only 2 of them. Both said they wouldn't take me on because I was too old. Too old at 18 years old! (In hindsight it was probably because they didn't want to pay anymore than the bare minimum).

So I gave up on that idea and I got a couple of temp office jobs which were terrible and then I got a permanent office job which wasn't too bad but was unlikely to really go anywhere.

So I stayed there for a few years while I enjoyed my life from 19 to 22. Living at home, living for the weekend. Spending all my money on beer, car insurance and 18-30s holidays. The glory days.

It wasn't until I was doing some spreadsheet work (ok every day was spreadsheet work) that I started investigating how I could make some of the mundane day to day tasks a little simpler. I went beyond the formulas and functions in excel to VBA. The programming language behind the Microsoft Office products which could automate work for you if you knew how to manipulate it.

I became fascinated with this.

I picked up a few VBA books and on my lunch break I tinker with the scripts to make all the little 20 minute tasks in my day 2 second tasks instead. So I had a relatively easy life at work . . . and it was all the morning because of it.

I think I just woke up one day and though that if I can do this on my own with no formal training and enjoy it then surely I must be able to get a proper job doing this all the time. So I did a bit of research. Looking into ""proper"" programming jobs (liked the look of how much more they payed as well) and went about making my programming career happen.

Step one. In every single advert they pretty much all said as the number one basic requirement ""Must have minimum 2:1 degree in Computer Science, Software Engineering or similar"". So that was objective number one. Get the degree. The only catch was my A levels were shockingly shit and I wasn't likely to get onto a degree course in the UK to do CS unless the uni was equally as shockingly shit.

I had two options. Further education evening college course for a year or do a foundation year. The foundation year was basically an AS level but at the university. I knew what I wanted. To get the hell onto a degree course as soon as possible and out of my current situation. So foundation year it was and then after passing that with a distinction (turns out I can do maths when you have to pay over £5000 to do it) I went onto the full degree.

One first class degree later I'm in my first software development job. I really enjoy it and also enjoy programming in my spare time (like 99% of this site I image). It's great fun making things on the computer which mere morals cannot even image how it's done! (that's definitely taking it too far)

The road does not end here though. I'm still learning. Still pushing myself and still looking out for opportunities to better myself on a daily basis. The best thing is I have a path a number of goals which give me a reason to get up in the morning.

That does not give him the right to claim a unilateral voice for the disabled. The majority of us were not born into privilege.

Many only become fully aware that they're disabled well into adulthood. You probably interact with adults with disability more often than you think.

Speaking for myself (some of my disabilities are mental health related). Many people would be shocked at the dearth of adult mental health services in his country. Imagine being told 'you have bowel cancer, we'll put you on an indefinite waiting list for treatment... (try to present at A&amp;E in crisis regularly - we might bump you up the list, or even put you on a better, shorter list), but in the meantime just wait until we contact you...'

I went ten years as a taxpayer with (among others) mental health disabilities. I had no intervention in that decade. It was only when I fell apart again and started becoming a regular at A&amp;E for overdoses that the wheels of treatment were set in motion.

As it stands, I lost four months of work to ill health, but managed to keep my job and am on the primo list for mental healthcare now. I lost friends, I nearly lost family, but I never once wanted to skive or shirk.

I was an advice worker for a while, often advising people with less complex problems than my own. It took guts to admit my own frailty and start the path to recovery. That path is open to me, for now. How dare those bastards condemn those who are disabled to a life of dependency and then blame them for it?

The ones that don't are tenuous; sure, Latin used to be a language of science., but I'm a scientist and never use Latin. When I do use loanwords, it's sufficient to use them without knowledge of their language of origin. If for some bizarre reason I did want to read Newton's Mathematica Principia, I would read an English translation. When I refer to the radiation emitted by accelerating charged particles, it's sufficient to refer to it as Bremsstrahlung without knowledge that it is a compound word coming from the German root words Bremsen (to brake) and Strahlung (radiation). It's not a particularly good set of reasons for learning Latin, and I'm sure there are many.

There is a wealth of influential literature and historical sources written in Latin. I'm sure it is a worthy intellectual pursuit if you enjoy digging through historical archives or reading specific articles of poetry from the late middle ages, but if you just want the generic benefits that come with learning a language there are far better uses of your time. 

It is the equivalent of advocating that children should receive education in particle physics at school. It is a fundamental study that underpins everything, it teaches kids important mathematical, analytical and problem solving skills. Everything is made of particles, so it will really help them if they understand matter at the most fundamental level. If they learn about particle physics, it makes it easier for them to learn about electronic circuits and how they work.

In reality, while it wouldn't strictly be a waste of time, there are far better things to be doing with that time. I'm sure well over 99% of the people who construct electronic circuits have a rudimentary understanding of particle physics at best, and yet they make really good electricians and engineers. If we want to teach kids maths then maths lessons are clearly a better alternative to particle physics lessons, if a student wants to study chemistry it is sufficient for them to simply learn what an electron is; they don't need an in-depth understanding of the standard model of particle physics to even be a quantum/physical chemist. It's a worthy intellectual pursuit but it's ridiculous to advocate it at the base level of education. Unless the proposed benefit is that the children become more proficient at particle physics, then it is a waste of resources that would be better spent elsewhere.

The fact that FSG stopped the administration penalty and have gotten the expansion underway after over a decade of the new stadium being talked about and revealed and yet never happening - that does buy them a fair bit of time. And as foreign owners go they seem to be doing an OK job. It's not like the Mancs are all that chuffed with the Glazers, and I'm not sure Abramovic and Sheik Mansour would be quite so successful in a post-FFP era where they can't just throw ridiculous amounts of money to solve problems with the squad. 

If we'd gotten some Singapore billionaire instead five years ago and he'd pumped a ton of money in quickly before FFP came into force, then I'd say we'd probably be better off (though Man City have hardly been bagging trophies for fun).

This should be your first resource to check things like your rights at work; it's extremely clear and easy to follow.  The next place you should check is your contract and employee handbook.  Dude, reddit should not be the first resort :-)

UK workers are normally entitled to a minimum 28 days per year of annual leave, including bank holidays.  That's a *minimum* entitlement; many employers increase this allowance at their own discretion, or place some additional, workplace-specific restrictions on that entitlement (e.g., workers in retail often are prohibited from taking any of their holiday in December whilst the stores are busy, whilst on the other hand some employers require all employees to take 2 days' annual leave between Christmas and New Year whilst the office is closed).  Check your employment contract and employee handbook which you should have been given when you started your current job.    

https://www.gov.uk/browse/working/time-off

Note that annual leave (vacation) is completely separate to sick pay, which you will receive if you are off work whilst ill.  Your National Insurance contributions (which are automatically deducted from your pay before you receive it) are part of an insurance scheme that entitles you to receive sick pay in addition to your minimum holiday allowance.  You can simply declare yourself as ill for illnesses lasting fewer than 7 days; for more than 7 consecutive days' illness you need a sick note from a doctor.  If you are ill during your holiday, you should be able to report the illness to your employer, take the sick leave, and get your annual leave allowance re-credited. 

https://www.gov.uk/taking-sick-leave

In addition to annual leave (for days off and holidays) and sick pay (for when you are sick) you are usually entitled to reasonable time off for dealing with family emergencies, maternity/paternity leave and compassionate leave.

How often does your local policeman carry tasers, body armour and fucking firearms? Not very.

Is this a joke? It is a summing up of your view on the matter I suppose. I know which one is more likely to attack me, that's for sure. 

I don't think you understand that there are criminals out there who do more damage to people than the 'drunk teenagers' you're talking about.

If you can't do better than offering up stupid, unlikely scenarios as justification for your view then don't bother replying.

30 second Pre Buffer: Yes, it's actually ALWAYS recording on a digital buffer for 30 seconds of video only, no audio. You press the start record button and it then writes that buffer to memory and carries on recording, with audio. That's super clever, if you think of the consequences of it.. an officer can think 'Oh shit I wish I was recording this' and on doing so 30 seconds of previous footage is held and recorded. Neat.

Completely disagree. To me, there are 3 parts to liberalism. Economic, Social and Political. 

Economic Liberalism is the belief in a competetive market, where companies are relatively lightly regulated save some regulation to protect things like the environment, protect citizens and stop monopolies. The Greens are not in any way economically liberal, they wanted huge restrictions on companies such as workers councils in companies and other illiberal ideals. 

Social Liberalism, is what the Greens specialise in. Things like same-sex marriage come under this strain, and are extremely important to a happy, and healthy society. Expanding our views forward, and being more inclusive in my mind will do nothing but good for the thousands of people around the world, and in the UK who still experience oppression, and discrimination. I fully welcome the Greens help on these issues, and commend them for their actions. 

Political Liberalism is less well-defined, and can be put it with social Liberalism. It's more to do with things such as the banning of Legal Highs, the snoopers charter and personal freedoms over the state. To a certain extent, PR comes under this too. I accept the Greens have a liberal attitude on most of these things, but I fear that without being economically liberal enough, the control the State has can easily be extended to the political freedoms of the individual too, regardless of intent.

UKIP are Libertarian, socially centrist (although I'm personally socially liberal) and right-wing economically.

This means that they are in favour of a government with as little state intervention as possible.

In essence it's: stay the hell out of people's personal lives, and stay out of what business do too. Leave them alone and they'll do amazing things. No spying, no government telling you how to run your life, no bedroom tax, no inheritance tax, no tax on a minimum wage.

It sounds incredibly liberal and completely different to what you'd expect a right-wing party to do, but that is what UKIP is all about.

The EU question also has ties to Libertarian ideology because they're fed up of all the British laws being made by the more powerful government in Brussels and want to make migration to Britain fair and open to everyone, not just EU citizens.

1. DEEP BREATH - I loved it, but probably only because it was the first time I'd seen a Doctor's first episode the same time as every other fan.
2. INTO THE DALEK - Very much disliked this one and was rather disappointed with it.
3. ROBOT OF SHERWOOD - I pretend this episode didn't happen.
4. LISTEN - Thought this episode was just okay.
5. TIME HEIST - Loved the new creature that was introduced here and the episode was pretty good, too.
6. THE CARETAKER - One of my favourites from Series 8.
7. KILL THE MOON - Hated this episode SO MUCH.
8. MUMMY ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS - Absolutely my favourite episode of the whole of 8.
9. FLATLINE - I heard many people like this episode but I thought it was ho-hum.
10. IN THE FOREST OF THE NIGHT - I thought this episode was really boring :/
11. DARK WATER - Really enjoyed this one but I found it a bit confusing.

null,false,mvrander,null,null,null,"Hopefully this will be a good tournament but just a few words on what I saw at last year's EGX at Earl's court if I may, not addressing this to anyone but here seems as good a place as any. Honestly no offence meant by any of this, I'd just like to see things run a little differently this year if possible.

I went to EGX on the Saturday last year and the main tournament event that day was LOL so there was a lack of focus on the Dota 2 set up as the event for Dota was Sunday I believe. Either way the stand (mini lan set up ) for Dota 2 that day did very little to promote Dota to people that were not already fans of the game

There were 10-15 year old kids walking over having heard the name, sitting down and running into towers whilst the one person on a PC that had played the game before went 45-0 on a PA.

The exact words from one kid's mouth was ""this it the worst game ever"".

While that was going on the 4 or 5 staff who appeared to be there to run the event were sitting at their control desk chatting to each other. There may have been an IT issue at the time or they may have been focused on the following day, I'm not sure.

Me and another lad tried to explain to people what the game was about, how it is played and just how good it is but it seemed like a token effort.

I believe the staff hired to run that stand (possible epiclan, I'm not sure) were given a brief to run the lan side of things so I don't really want to criticise them, but hopefully this year the focus can be on presenting the game, engaging the passing visitors and talking to people who are interested. Maybe walk people through the tutorials or give a little talk every half hour to those that have gathered around.

I was only near the stall for a short while so what I saw could have been a bad hour but if the stall is there again this year I'd hope it looks more like a games promotion stall and less like a 90's after work network game.",null,0,null,1433373564,null,0,false,0,cruqar2,null,t3_38czq1,null,t1_cruqar2,null,t3_38czq1,null,null,null,1436707127,null,0,false,UKDota,t5_2uyoj,0,null

I can understand the dislike of them, but solicitors are not allowed to pursue such cases speculatively - only if they believe they have a genuine chance of winning.

Before NWNF you might find yourself unable to claim damages for something that had harmed you because you couldn't afford the lawyer. If you don't have much savings and the other party knew this, they could just bog your lawyers down in paperwork (disclosure requests &amp;c) and then when you ran out of money you were no longer a threat to them. Now your lawyer can say ""we'll take this on on conditional"" and carry the case to court for you.

Seems like NWNF has been undergoing constant refinement since it was introduced 2 decades ago - I get the impression that the legal establishment is actually pretty wary of it.

I suspect the thing is just so hamfisted and poorly edited that I'm projecting my views onto it. The article should probably have just been a straight forward ""this is what the ECHR are reviewing"" or separate articles for both of the cases outlined. I just expect better writing from the BBC.

Looking at the population predictions, the Anglophone countries are predicted to have high to moderate population growth during this century (we are, I think, the slowest-growing), whereas most other countries in the developed world (most of continental Europe and the Far East, and also middle-income countries such as most of Latin America) will have stagnant or declining, and steadily ageing, populations. All of this will likely result in a major restructuring of the global economic and political system &amp;ndash; an ever more deeply entrenched divide between the older, less populous and wealthier developed countries (e.g. Germany, Canada, Korea), and the younger, overpopulated and much poorer ones (e.g Nigeria, Pakistan, Indonesia).

Good. Northern Ireland has had more than enough problems with its police force taking sides in the past, and is only now getting to the stage where it is becoming socially acceptable for nationalists to serve in the police force. The last thing that needs to be done is to politicise the PSNI so as to enable them to be viewed as serving the unionist community at the expense of nationalists. The sectarian policing rabbit hole is one that no one wants to see Northern Ireland go down again. Unless of course you would like mainstream republicans to dig out the rocket launchers and go back to firing at patrols and killing police officers.

A lot of us ended up in the law-finance-consultancy-accountancy-pr nexus. Some of us got the hell out after a couple of years, but most of those who stayed seem to be hating their jobs and sometimes their whole lives.

What the article didn't spell out is that most of the firms in these industries all rely on the same business model, which feeds off of the naiveté and youthful enthusiasm of young graduates. For a relatively modest salary armies of ""associates"" put in unconscionable hours doing what is largely drudge work on white collar production lines. Disillusionment and cynicism are endemic, excessive drinking is the standard remedy. I think it's fair to say that most grads don't quite realise what they're getting into - I certainly didn't.

The article isn't aimed at those who for whatever reason *want* to work in those industries, but at those (perhaps the majority) who ""don't know what they want to do"" and can therefore be seduced into jobs which will not make them happy or are not in their best interest. Meanwhile, the alternatives are largely hidden from view because they don't have the resources to carry out the same kind of flashy recruitment drives.

Cambridge Careers Service seem to get it. The fact that they have an event called ""But I don’t want to work in the City” tells you a lot about the assumptions and pressures placed upon students and graduates today.

The one adjustment they do make is to acknowledge status quos as explaining why women have a ""slightly"" higher success rate (50% vs 63% in sole residence cases), which is discounted from then on. The conclusion reads:

&gt; Our research found that the success rate for mothers and fathers in applications for orders to have their children live with them was similar within our sample.

&gt; [...]

&gt; Mothers and fathers sought the residence orders for different reasons. There was a clear correlation between the presence of very serious child welfare concerns, local authority involvement and applications by fathers for residence. While transfers of sole residence were rare as the courts as the courts sought to preserve status quo where transfers were ordered they were disproportionately likely to be transfers from mum to dad and to feature welfare concerns and children’s services involvement.

This is best understood in the context of sections 4.4.4 and 4.5.2.1, which tell us these concerns are overwhelmingly supported and make up the majority of cases where residence was transferred. This is the exact phenomenon being discussed at the top of this thread: men are bringing cases in more extreme situations where you'd expect them to win. That success rates overall are ""similar"" despite this could itself indicate a bias, something the authors don't explore at all. I find that a bit troubling considering their eagerness to analyze away variations in favour of women.",null,0,null,1433375203,null,0,1433375904,0,crur6un,null,t3_387omc,null,t1_crur6un,null,t1_crug4pf,null,null,null,1436707870,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

Wouldn't say it was cutting so much as spending what we can actually afford. We're held to FFP, and we're barely managing to stay compliant. You want to up the wage bill, then we have to spend less on transfers instead. It's a finite pool of money to play with and that's the trade-off - it's not possible to have it both ways. We can't spend like we're Man Utd when their revenue is near double ours. 

&gt; Increase in ticket prices.

The increase in ticket prices at Liverpool is high, but it's not really out of line with the clubs around us, and the increases at the club were pretty similar before FSG took over. And the fact that matchdays still sell out ridiculously quickly would suggest that games are still way oversubscribed and ticket prices could be a lot higher if it was all about matching price to supply/demand to screw as much money as possible out of fans.

Anyway yup England lost, but can get to the 3rd/4th playoff, if they beat the tournaments worst team [China](http://www.toulontournament.com/standings/) on Friday.

The game, well England played a 4-2-3-1, which was interesting because it seemed to give clarity on who were the defensive and attacking midfield players. Harrison Reed had by his standards a quiet game I thought, seemed the other players didn't see him when he was free. 

England scored first in the first half, when the Sunderland midfield player Watmore benefited from an attempted back pass that glanced off his head and in. He did make a good run to get into the position to take advantage of the opportunity.

Then England lost the initiative and Mexico scored twice for the comeback win. Jack Stephens who is listed on the website as MF with Harrison, played as a right sided center defender, and was in full beast mode. He looked like he was stronger and taller than any other player on the field, almost like he was a full international playing down a level. He dominated in the air, to the point where the Mexicans stopped putting in high balls to the box, certainly after half time when I guess the coach told them not to bother. The second Mexican goal was a header, but from a cross to the far past where the full back was out jumped. So yes very impressed with Jack Stephens, he looks close to being first team material, maybe pace maybe an issue, and distribution? Also he will be competing with Fonte, if that was his regular position he was playing for England, so maybe some more loan time in his future.

Anyway that is the report with the Saints bias :)-. Here is the official [FA](http://www.thefa.com/news/england/development/2015/jun/u20s-toulon-tournament-mexico-match-report-duncan-watmore) version.
