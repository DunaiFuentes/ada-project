**Man Utd**
United have 8 midfielders, 4 of which are attacking/wide midfielders:
Di Maria, Januzaj, Young, Mata
Whilst the remaining four are central midfielders
Carrick, Blind, Herrera, Fellaini
Meanwhile the following three can and have played midfield.
Valencia, Depay, Jones

**Chelsea**
Chelsea also had 8 first team midfielders last season, their attacking quartet of:
Hazard, Oscar, Cuadrado, Willian
Whilst Fabregas, Mikel, Matic, Ramires play centrally and mostly deeper.
They've recently promoted Lotus-Cheek to the first team and signed young Brazilian Nathan. What happens to these two this season remains to be seen however.
Finally Chelsea have been linked with signing A.Song, although that may be because Mikel reportedly wants out.
Chelsea could end up with 11 midfielders but I'd highly doubt this. 

**Man City**
City had 8 midfielders last season too;
Silva, Nasri, Navas
Fernandinho, Fernando, Toure
Although Lampard and Milner have moved on and City now look desperately short in this area.
Although they have been linked with De Bruyne, Pogba and Sterling. Bringing their number to 9 possibly.

**Arsenal**
Last season Arsenal had 11 possible midfielders;
Attacking/Wide they had; 
Ozil, Ox, Rosicky, Sanchez, Walcott, 
Centrally they had Coquelin, Flamini, Wilshere, Arteta
Whilst Ramsey and Cazorla can play either. Admittedly Wilshere and Arteta(?) missed a lot of the season, and as a 12th option Diaby, although he hasn't been fit in years.

**Spurs**
Spurs squad boasted 10 midfielder last season;
Stamboulli, Capoue, Dembele, Mason, Bentaleb, 
supported by Eriksen, Lamela, Townsend, Chadli, 
Although Paulinho has now left the club, they still have Lennon and Ali Dele to return from loan. 



So as you can see, we aren't overstacked in midfield, and if we are then so are most of the other clubs above us, some more so than others. Not to mention, we have a whole raft of young players that may struggle to stay consistent throughout the season. P.s.

The customer service was brilliant, walked in and was seen immediately by a man who measured me and asked me what kind of suit I was looking for (colour? breasted? slim? looser? what colour shirt are you going to wear with it? and so on) and for what kind of price. He then brought me a selection of them to try on and told me where I'd need adjustments made. All in all he really seemed to know his stuff and I felt like he knew what I wanted as well, and he was really pleasant and a good laugh while being very professional. The customer service was what set it apart the most. 

I ended up with a blue three-piece for £145 (they had loads of cheaper ones but I wanted one I'd get a decade's wear out of) and the quality is beautiful. It's so comfy to wear, helped by the fact that it's my exact size and they did the alterations for free.

Nope, we are at war with a small number of ethnicities in certain regions because we have wholeheartedly backed other ethnicities that they don't get on well with. We've spun this to be a war on ""radicalism"" to make it palatable for the masses. Our choice in ally has nothing to do with morality, democracy or freedom, but is instead based entirely around who we want to win at that particular moment. 

ISIS isn't a religious movement, it's the obvious and only result of our deBaathification policy. This was all warned about before we did it. Utterly predicable. You can't ban an entire ethnicity from politics, particularly when you hand full power to people that don't like them. You know all of those torture photos? Which group do you think the victims were from?

Imagine what would happen if we were to ban Catholics from politics in Northern Ireland. That's literally what we did in Iraq, then the Americans had the fucking stupidity to train, fund and arm them because they happened to be in Syria for a time, having fled there from the torturous psychopaths we've put in power in Iraq.

If you're rich, you're maybe going to benefit. If you're poor, history has already shown that you're on your own whenever your interests begin to conflict with the rich. Constant, unmanaged growth has left us with a situation where less than 100 people own a full half of the world's wealth. I would humbly suggest that wrapping arguments in favour of growth in terms of helping the poor might not be the best approach.

Why would Bamford leave? He already was going to go out on loan next season. And why would Remy leave? He knew another striker was going to be bought as soon as Drogba left. I'm sure he understands there was always going to be 3 strikers. Most players like competition contrary to popular opinion. If Falcao displaces him throughout the season and he wants to leave so be it. It means he was up to the standard we demand. But I'm sure he will do fine. 

I'll never understand fans complaining about buying someone and someone else possibly leaving because of it. If people don't play it's because they weren't better than who ever started in front of them. Remy is replaceable. We shouldn't avoid signing people in fear he might leave in the future.

He has a weird instinct to try and destroy everything he can put his beak on (assuming he isn't very afraid of an unknown object/food/previously untested and suspicious object). He's cranky when he's tired, and if he didn't take a nap, he's very grumpy.

He likes to play with his food, and make a mess of things. Murdered fruits are way better than ordinary-looking ones. It's better if you put some strawberry all over the floor and the white walls.

If he's alone in a room, he'll call and call for you to come back. When you're next to him but not giving him enough attention, he'll tell you aaaaaall about it.

Imitating pleasant sounds is not fun. The annoying alarm buzz, outdoor sirens, barking like the long-dead next-door dog, and any high-pitched sound is very fun.

He talks to the TV. You can't concentrate on a movie if he decided that the main character was talking to him.

If he doesn't like a song that you're listening to, he'll screech to cover the noise you're making him listen to. Screeching noises are way better.

Nothing is more fun than picking up a toy from the top of his cage, looking right at you, and dropping it on the floor. And when you pick it up, it's really funny to drop it again. And again. And again. But when you don't play anymore, then ignore the toy.

And just like a toddler..... Silence is not golden. Silence is extremely, extremely suspicious.


EXTREMELY SUSPICIOUS.




But it's all good in the end. That little animal is happy when I get up in the morning, knows my name and calls me when he wants my company, will come and give me kisses and ask for head scratches, have fun playing with me and learning cool tricks, will defend me against enemies (especially those highly suspicious blue hair ribbons, and the dreaded pink nail polish (other colors are tolerated)).

He talks to me, loves to sit next to me and watch TV (and yes, a lot of Doctor Who is included. He loves the sonic screwdriver sound. Sometimes I swear he remembers some episodes, he always reacts the same when he sees some scenes, I'm beginning to experiment.) He's learning to communicate, and when he wants some apple, he says ""apple"". Any other fruit will end up thrown on the floor with all the hate of a raging Dalek.)


... The reputation is NOT WORSE than the reality. It's A LOT of work. It takes dedication. And time. But it gives back so much, it's worth it.

But with great feathers, come great responsibility. Don't worry, though, just like a toddler, once you have him, it all makes sense. Nothing can truly prepare you for having a little kid at home, but when you're faced with the reality, it all falls into place naturally. You establish some rules, but then if everybody respects them and puts some effort into it, you don't really think about the work behind it. Sure, there WILL BE some boundary-pushing once in a while, but... It's all good fun.


It's the most interesting pet I've ever had the pleasure of cohabiting with. It's only natural to have to deserve it! :)

null,false,po8crg,null,null,null,"I agree on Bradford (should also build a Bradford-Sheffield direct line - that journey is ludicrous at present, and it could operate as an extension to MML to St Pancras)

Not convinced about Picc-Vic; Ordsall Chord does 90% of Pic-Vic at a much lower price.

As for TL2 (or Crossrail 3 - name doesn't matter): the right option is probably London Bridge or Fenchurch Street to Marylebone, connecting Chilterns locals to South Eastern or c2c - post Crossrail 2 and the Tring/Crossrail 1 connection, those are the only locals that aren't going into a tunnel (SWT is crossrail2, Southern TL1, Greater Anglia feeds both Crossrail 1 and 2, Great Northern TL1, BedPan locals are TL1, WCML locals are diverted to Crossrail 1, GWML locals Crossrail 1). There might be some WCML locals (from Aylesbury) that could go into the tunnel also, with a junction in Kenton.  You're still going to have the issue that there's more demand east and south of London than north and west (because there's more tube to the north and west) so some trains have to stop at the north/west mainline station (Paddington for Crossrail 1, Marylebone for TL2; Crossrail 2 solves this by overserving the Alexandra Palace branch).

On HS2/HS3, agreed entirely, and also on HS2.3.  It might make sense to build a short section of track from Newcastle to Carlisle for Newcastle/Scotland trains. With no stations on it at all it should cost about £5bn (cheap land, relatively flat route paralleling Hadrian's Wall, the existing railway and the A69, virtually no houses to CPO or blight) and - to my surprise - the route from Newcastle to Edinburgh is barely longer than a more direct route (unless you go through Northumberland National Park), and Newcastle-Glasgow is actually shorter. Trains could sensibly run from Hull, stopping in York and the Tees-side Parkway station (at the most convenient spot on the line near Middlesborough - probably just outside Darlington) and then reverse at Newcastle, before calling in Carlisle en route to Glasgow or Edinburgh. None of that track would be especially busy, so even half-empty trains would still make financial sense.  It would also provide an alternative route for Scotland/London and Scotland/Birmingham trains (via HS2) and Scotland/Manchester trains (via HS3 and Leeds) allowing for closure of the main western route for maintenance as needed.

As for HS4, the problem is the London end - there's no sensible place for a station, so the only option is one deep underground. But an underground station is half as big if it's built as a through station with connections at both ends;  the station construction saves about as much as the extra tunnel to get out of London costs.  So the sensible option is actually (strangely) to build both at once: Swansea-Cardiff-Bristol-London-a junction near Cambridge. From the junction, one line runs through Cambridge to Norwich or Ipswich (or both, with a junction near Newmarket) and the other runs past Leicester (possibly with a station) to connect to HS2 near Nottingham/Derby.  Then all the trains from London to the eastern branch of HS2 (Leeds, Newcastle, Hull, Sheffield, Nottingham, Derby) divert to this new route, freeing capacity on HS2 for more trains to Scotland.  You also build a little single-track high-speed branchline along the Lea Valley from Stratford to the new London-Cambridge line, giving a connection to HS1 and the channel tunnel for a fraction of the price of an HS1-HS2 link.

On the western route, you also build a branch line to Southampton from (roughly) Newbury, allowing trains from Southampton to go in both directions (ie Cardiff-Southampton trains as well as Southampton-London).

Then HS5 is Birmingham-Bristol-Exeter-Plymouth, connecting to the existing HS2 and HS4 stations (so only two new stations), and you have a complete national network - the largest cities off that grid are Belfast, Brighton and Aberdeen, all of which would require very expensive dedicated infrastructure, while most other cities of their size are served as part of a system connecting to bigger places, or on a short branch.",null,0,null,1435775073,null,0,false,0,csoyhcy,null,t3_3bqk2w,null,t1_csoyhcy,null,t1_csoktc8,null,null,null,1440506514,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Which is pretty well everything concerning TLS.

When your web browser establishes a secure connection with that little padlock symbol, it means nobody - not your ISP, not even MI5 or GCHQ themselves - can intercept and read what's going across the connection. That's what ""end to end"" means. 

The most they can say is ""there's a secure connection to this IP address"", but in these days where so many things are hosted with huge hosting companies like Amazon and SNI means you can have multiple SSL certificates used by one IP address means even that's not terribly helpful.

It's the bedrock of all modern security, and it's used by web browsers, email clients - pretty well anything that establishes a secure connection.

The only way to intercept it is to intercept the connection, decrypt it and re-encrypt it. Which works just fine, but can't be done without it being obvious that someone's playing silly buggers. The only way to make it hidden to even the most casual observer requires getting a your root certificate into everyone's computer and phone. Good luck with that.

You should apply to the court about having him disbarred as a director, or apply to the insolvency service. I should think that you can still do this, as generally debts can be pursued for up to 6 years.

&gt; ""Back to 1943, when there were Nip bases all along the north coast of New Guinea, and through the Solomons. So, let us say that within a brief window of time following this Azure message from Tokyo, a number of messages are transmitted from places like Rabaul and Manila to smaller bases in those areas. Some of them are in ciphers that we have learned how to break. Now, it is not unreasonable to suppose that some of these messages were sent out as a consequence of whatever orders were contained in that Azure message.""

&gt; ""But those places send out thousands of messages a day,"" Comstock protests. ""What makes you think that you can pick out the messages that are a consequence of the Azure orders?""

&gt; ""It’s just a brute force statistics problem,"" Waterhouse says. ""Suppose that Tokyo sent the Azure message to Rabaul on October 15th, 1943. Now, suppose I take all of the messages that were sent out from Rabaul on October 14th and I index them in various ways: what destinations they were transmitted to, how long they were, and, if we were able to decrypt them, what their subject matter was. Were they orders for troop movements? Supply shipments? Changes in tactics or procedures? Then, I take all of the messages that were sent out from Rabaul on October 16th—the day after the Azure message came in from Tokyo—and I run exactly the same statistical analysis on them.""

&gt; Waterhouse steps back from the chalkboard and turns into a blinding fusillade of strobe lights. ""You see, it is all about information flow. Information flows from Tokyo to Rabaul. We don’t know what the information was. But it will, in some way, influence what Rabaul does afterwards. Rabaul is changed, irrevocably, by the arrival of that information, and by comparing Rabaul’s observed behavior before and after that change, we can make inferences.""

&gt; ""Such as?"" Comstock says warily.

&gt; Waterhouse shrugs. ""The differences are very slight. They hardly stand out from the noise. Over the course of the war, thirty-one Azure messages have gone out from Tokyo, so I have that many data sets to work with. Any one data set by itself might not tell me anything. But when I combine all of the data sets together—giving me greater depth—then I can see some patterns. And one of the patterns that I most definitely see is that, on the day after an Azure message went out to, say, Rabaul, Rabaul was much more likely to transmit messages having to do with mining engineers. This has ramifications that can be traced all the way back until the loop is closed.""

&gt; ""Loop is closed?""

&gt; ""Okay. Let’s take it from the top. Azure message goes from Tokyo to Rabaul,"" Waterhouse says, drawing a heavy line down the chalkboard joining those two cities. ""The next day, a message in some other crypto system—one that we have broken—goes from Rabaul to a submarine operating out of a base here, in the Moluccas. The message states that the submarine is to proceed to an outpost on the north coast of New Guinea and pick up four passengers, who are identified by name. From our archives, we know who these men are: three aircraft mechanics and one mining engineer. A few days later, the submarine transmits from the Bismarck Sea stating that it has picked those men up. A few days after that, our waterfront spies in Manila inform us that the same submarine has showed up there. On the same day, another Azure message is transmitted from Manila back up to Tokyo,"" Waterhouse concludes, adding a final line to the polygon, ""closing the loop.""",null,0,null,1435775968,null,0,false,0,csoz40h,null,t3_3bqs5q,null,t1_csoz40h,null,t1_csoomsm,null,null,null,1437498150,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

null,false,hu6Bi5To,null,null,null,"&gt; That's what ""end to end"" means.

That's not the commonly accepted definition: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption

Previous versions of iMessage weren't end-to-end, even thought they used TLS, they were encrypted user to Apple, and again from Apple to recipient, but were unencrypted at Apple.  If you combine both with some sort of self-routing for messages that can't be traced, then you really would be giving GCHQ problems; even end-to-end could deliver significant metadata based on how it was routed.

&gt; When your web browser establishes a secure connection with that little padlock symbol, it means nobody - not your ISP, not even MI5 or GCHQ themselves - can intercept and read what's going across the connection.

You're doing GCHQ a great disservice if you think they're foiled by mere TLS, the Snowden archives are full of specific services and whole encryption products being by-passed by GCHQ.  Even going as far as to compromise machines belonging to certificate authorities (and other security sensitive organisations like SIM card manufacturers) to obtain root keys allowing the generation of fake certificates.

And TLS is just one ""hop"", you mention Amazon.  On AWS most TLS is terminated at the ELB, the rest of the data is then unencrypted to your EC2 box somewhere.  How many interception points are there between those two?  Who knows.  One bit of fibre in a trench between two buildings: easily wiretapped.

&gt; The only way to intercept it is to intercept the connection, decrypt it and re-encrypt it. Which works just fine, but can't be done without it being obvious that someone's playing silly buggers. The only way to make it hidden to even the most casual observer requires getting a your root certificate into everyone's computer and phone. Good luck with that.

Indeed, it's obvious this is the motive.  Not even the current government are evil enough to ban encryption, they'll know there are a multitude of legitimate uses; they will use the threat of law to get compliance from most internet services (well those that have a UK presence anyway), and they will specifically force ISPs to MITM services that don't comply.

""But the users will know it has an invalid certificate!""  Indeed, but what are they going to do, use one of the ones that does have a valid certificate?  Because they'll be the ones that have data-sharing agreements with the government.  Effectively this will be a ban on non-complying services, but won't be worded as much, ""it's just a lawful intercept, it's not the governments fault the iMessage protocol won't work with an invalid certificate; all Apple has to do is sign this certificate for wesnoop-proxy.gov.uk then the service will run just fine.""",null,0,null,1435776965,null,0,false,0,csozt44,null,t3_3bqs5q,null,t1_csozt44,null,t1_csoyruv,null,null,null,1437498287,null,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8,null

That means a longer contract for security and the chance of little game time, and with a transfer fee it will be a bigger financial obligation than somebody like Falcao who is at least experienced and we know he CAN play on the big stage.

The title says it's an article about transfers and new signings but the first paragraph (bar the introduction of Clyne) talks almost exclusively about the defence. Further, it's a paragraph with some strange statements that just aren't backed up or touched upon or reasoned. Clyne is not really like Can. Rodgers values versatility and Can has played in various positions in the past hence why he covered when we were stretched in those positions last season. Also a bit of tired joke about Jose Enrique and hardly an insightful view.  
  

&gt;While last summer’s signings set the bar very low

I could only assume you mean the bar of expectation? As far as I recall expectation was rife.  

&gt;especially when compared to Lambert-level disappointments.  
  
Why did you target Lambert? To me it was fairly obvious who the better transfer was in terms of rate of return to price tag/expectation levels..  

&gt; [When looking at Ings] he stacks up quite nicely when compared to Lambert, who was aging, slow, and an average performer who managed to bag a few goals in a Southampton side  

You mean Rickie Lambert who scored 13 last season and 15 the season before compared to Ings who scored 11? On top of that the only top half clubs he scored against were United (4th) and Stoke (9th).  

&gt;[About Joe Gomez] He’s one for the future, and I would not be surprised to see him in the centre of defense next to Can in the coming years.  

Do you rate Can or not? Do you want Rodgers to play him in his preferred position or not? Seems very ambiguous.  

&gt;Moreover, he’s someone else Brendan can throw at right back when he just wants to have a laugh  

Not very well reasoned commentary.

Firmino and Volland scored 10 in all competitions according to [here](http://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/hoffenheim/2014-15/top-scorers.html).

Plugging this into the relevant places right now, I'm told 48 minutes Stansted to Liverpool St (per NRE) or 46 minutes Heathrow to Liverpool St (per TfL).

I'll grant you the latter includes changes, so arguably has more chance of that being 'optimistic', and losing out in reality, but hardly by much.  Once Crossrail opens, it'll be even quicker.

&gt;  It is well positioned for a lot of the UK population with the M11 &amp; A14.

I'm an east anglian boy and I can't really agree here either, the region is pretty lowly population by English standards.  The M11 is ok, if you're coming from Cambridge or London/M25, but it's not great to funnel people from elsewhere via the M25.  The A14 is notoriously awful for being a giant car park of stationary lorries.

Imho from a strictly london-centric perspective it's the least convenient of the lot, from a wider perspective if you were looking to serve the UK as a whole it's way behind places like Birmingham/East Midlands.",null,0,null,1435778068,null,0,false,0,csp0k0y,null,t3_3bqoyi,null,t1_csp0k0y,null,t1_csozkls,null,null,null,1437498983,null,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3,null

In your previous thread you said:

but here you've said:

&gt; However, he didn't bother dissolving it, he just started a new company, stayed in the same office location, and just put the new name up. I'm not even sure if it's been dissolved now.

I'm confused. Did you get your money back or not? In the last thread you were insinuating that you hadn't, but if the company still exists and you won your legal action then why didn't you enforce the order against it?

I have no reason to believe you're distorting the truth in this, but your explanation of what's happened sounds very strange indeed.

If you don't have a regular routine it's probably best to figure one out. One that suits you. 

Find a gentle cleanser, something like Simple's moisturising face wash. 

Then maybe some kind of chemical exfoliation, Stridex pads in the red tub seem to be pretty popular. The salicylic acid will help clear your skin. 
Make sure you moisturise afterwards with a light moisturiser. Again, Simple have a light moisturiser that's natural and works well. However, if you're prescribed certain moisturisers it might be best to stick to them. 

If you're still getting problems you could try going to the doctors as they can help you out with prescriptions and a more professional opinion.

Look, I appreciate the thought - you're concerned for the safety of others, great. But we all know. It's a personal decision how much gear we wear, and we make it as informed people who know it's a risk. Some of us choose to wear more, some wear less. 90% of the time, I wear all my gear - but if I go out in 34 degree heat in stop-start traffic in my black leather jacket, sure, I'll be safer if I do crash, but I'm also increasing my risk of crashing by distracting myself with heat.

Of course if you're just looking for any sort of graduate job that'll be easy enough - well depending on the competition for the job which in some parts of the country is ridiculous. 

&amp;nbsp;


A degree in general though - even down to a 3rd is basically having a certificate that says you're not a retard and you are semi competent. So you'll be fine in the long run.

&amp;nbsp;


Some tips to getting your first job (probably something that any recent grads should do aswell): Have 1 main CV and a copy of said CV that you tailor to each job. Upload your main CV to a bunch of job search sites where applicable. Tailor your current CV to whatever job you're applying for( i.e. if you worked in a cinema and you're applying for a grad job that requires team work then get rid of stuff like ""served popcorn to customers"" and put something like ""worked as part of a team ensuring smooth running of day to day operations."" Basically you want to emphasize things you've done in the past that might be relevant to the job you're applying for. Just because you're a graduate: http://www.graduate-jobs.com/ might come in handy. Temp agencies are pretty good too: http://www.sugarman.co.uk/ the sugarman group have something that might overlap with your degree (Biomedicine?? not too sure though) but we've used the aforementioned and many other agencies in the past for projects. Very handy for you to build up experience fast. And last but not least: keep applying. One job app a week will not get you a job. One job app a day (takes maybe an hour or 2 at most) will give you a greater chance of netting a job.",null,0,null,1435785285,null,0,false,0,csp5e83,null,t3_3bs8na,null,t1_csp5e83,null,t3_3bs8na,null,null,null,1437502991,null,7,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,7,null

The government can already see where all internet traffic to/from the UK comes from/goes to - after a fashion. From the IP data you can know the source and destination, though this isn't always straightforward, the internet, as the name suggests, is actually a huge tangled mess of disparate networks. The source and destination aren't always meaningful in the wider context of a user's activity, when you look at one specific point in the chain. 

You can follow that logic your quote describes, much like is done now with people using tor (when a full cna isn't deemed appropriate, don't wanna burn juicy 0-days hacking some small time pedo), and you can know, for example, that some entity pokes out onto the web and touches some other entity, and then later on your intelligence target gets a big wad of money into his bank account, or perhaps you know his bitcoin wallet address. 

Anyway, they can already do this, and it's not the thing that's important here.

In this case, Cameron is after the content of messages. It's not enough, in his opinion, to know who's talking to who. His logic is that he can't use the logic of the person in your quote, because the parallel to picking up mining engineers, is a terrorist attack occurring.

It's easy to see why he thinks the way he does - he's obviously just not given enough thought, or hasn't been told, quite what needs to be sacrificed to achieve his goal. In your quote, it doesn't cost much, your talking about a hostile enemy nation, and military communications, and only those military communications. 

On the internet, the communications you want to look at, are all jumbled up in such a way that you can't only scrape your target's facebook messages, or his snapchats, or his whatever - if it's encrypted, and you're just looking at the wire. In order to find which packets have your target's communications in, your only option is to examine all packets, examine the content in some way, and then decide if you've found your target, after you've infringed upon the privacy of every person in the UK using the internet.

That last part is what some people, like me, don't think is worth doing, to achieve the goal of reading terrorist messages (ignoring for a second the actual frequency with which this would be an option or useful, if possible). Cameron, with his current understanding, thinks he's willing to give up privacy, presumption of innocence, and the ability to conduct commerce, just to read internet traffic. To someone informed, it sounds crazy... but here we are.

I have two other bikes so it didn't get a lot of use in the end and I gave it away to a friend last month. I averaged around 50mpg with spirited riding (to my standards) although I have known a colleague on an older 600 bandit getting much worse mpg due to much more spirited hooliganism (until he crashed).

My GF's verdict of the bandit was it's OK for shortish trips (around the UK) but not for longer trips. Over two hours she would start to complain. She has no such complaints on the back of the LT although I am sure it's better than a sports bike. She claims the Bandit is way better than the other two bikes she had tried so far, the Tenere and the Virago I had. We have gone around England and only in long sections of the trip she complained, when there were breaks during the day she was fine with 200-300 mile days as long as each leg was around 100 miles with at least an hour break (which was what we were doing, i.e., start from home near London, reach south Wales, go around a bit, then a bit more, then go around an other target, etc.). We went around Wales slowly climbing up towards Liverpool, Lake District, then Hadrian's wall, York moors, York, then back down south. The trip down from Newcastle to York was a bit too quick, and then York to home again in one go and I got too many complaints at those legs.

The biggest problem with quotas in business and employment is the possible damage done to meritocracy, because it's almost inevitable that you'll be discriminating against some people who are more fit for the job. With these quotas you're giving children a representative view of society and normalising them to things that still bear some subconscious stigma in older generations, without holding anyone back or sacrificing any other liberal values.

It's not very effective doing 50/50 quotas for women in science and FTSE 100 places, when we still have a society where only 30% take education and career paths that will benefit them in those jobs. Quotas and more monitoring of the entertainment industry, to include more depictions of women scientists and execs, as well as other minorities and disaffected groups, should go much further to changing internalised prejudices, without any concievable drawbacks.

1) The train. Southampton Central to Heathrow bus terminal takes just under 2 hours. You'd need to get a taxi from the ferry port to Central. Make sure you select to go to the bus terminal at Heathrow because otherwise you'll get routed into central London and then out on the Heathrow Express. Will be expensive (and even more expensive if you don't prebook tickets). Trains go pretty much every hour. Going to the bus terminal means you go most of the way by train and then the last 30 minutes by bus.

2) The bus. National Express. £20-ish each and takes just over 2 hours. Buses go every 1:00-1:30 hours. You're at the mercy of traffic and you'll need a taxi (or two) from the ferry terminal to the bus terminal in town.

3) Taxi. The headline figure will seem expensive but it can be ok when calculated per person. There are companies who specialize in going from the ferry terminal to Heathrow. For 6 of you it might work out cheaper than 6 last minute train tickets. You might find all the minibuses are booked up this late. The big advantage is you go straight from ferry to the airport without messing about. Can be  done in about 1:15-1:30 and a good taxi knows how to avoid traffic  on the M25.

There a plenty of players who would sacrifice to be number 2 to play for Chelsea. He isn't good enough to be a starter at any world class club. He is a back up. Or he can go play in a mid table team and start. That's his choice. The obvious one is to stay.

The majority of the 650 MPs do a great amount of work for their local area, regardless of party colour/affiliation, whilst the only ones in the news are the cabinet MPs, because they are in charge of the large-scale decisions. That's why in the GE we saw candidates that were expected to face a serious challenge or even lose their seat remain in power because their constituents value them and know what they will get from them. Douglas Carswell is a very good example of this, because he has voted largely along with the views of his constituents and was rewarded with this by winning both the by-election and the general election.

Single transferable could easily be worse because you likely to end up with someone 'you don't mind' being your MP instead of the person you want most. You could say that everyone could end up with their 2nd choice but if someone isn't anyones first, or even very many, you can question their legitimacy for the role very easily. Likewise, you can't claim that everyone who didn't vote for their MP under FPTP doesn't mind having them in power, just that they preferred at least one other candidate more.

If we were to change I'd take the system that the Scots use for their SNPs (I have no idea what exact system theirs is) because it allows the 'most popular' local candidate to win whilst regional listings make up the rest for a balance that represents the overall vote.",null,0,null,1435787516,null,0,false,0,csp6s77,null,t3_3bqs5q,null,t1_csp6s77,null,t1_csp4i7b,null,null,null,1437504158,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Rumors in the European football world are not to be trusted. This should be evident by the players we've been linked to who were never coming and those who went elsewhere. Football rumors are almost like the headlines suggesting that Donald trump has a chance of becoming president of the US. Of course, this could happen, but it is wildly unlikely. 

Isco is almost certainly staying at Real and if we land Pogba or De Bruyne, it will most likely only be one of them.

On top of this, it appears there may be FFP restrictions to contend with.

As far as Kolarov goes, he is really more of a situational impact sub at this level. He possesses a great left foot, strong mid-range free kicks, and good work rate, but by no means is he in this back four over Zabba. 

I think we should welcome the 1 or 2 big signings that we may add to the club and focus on getting the best out of the current starting XI while cultivating our young players.

You would essentially have to double your flying, and therefore airline costs which I don't need to tell you what that means, under your proposal as there is no such thing as a flight with 100%interconnecting passengers it's always a mix. 

So at a base level you've now got an extra flight to manage, one to LHR and the other to as yet unspecified airport for interconnects only, both of which could hypothetically be half full (let alone the fact that one of those flights you can't actually put on direct sale to a customer). 

Why would you do that when you could consolidate that into one flight to a hub airport where the range of destinations you can get to as an interconnect is at its widest? That's the whole point of large airports like Heathrow, to be the centre of hub and spoke systems that make the airline system as efficient and easy to use from a customer perspective as possible.

I think that this even involves adults getting prescriptions for things like thrush because the prescription charge is cheaper than going to the chemist and buying the items.

2. I assume that the university has a board of trustees or something, who are required to give approval of the chancellor's pay increase, otherwise they would lose their nonprofit status.

I appreciate that student fees have changed the nature of higher education, that chancellors are much better paid now, and that it's probably a bit of an old boys' network.

EDIT: and I understand you're resentful about paying for an education that should be free.

However, you do your arguments no credit when you make claims that are demonstrably untrue.

If we look at the 2013 - 2014 accounts for the University of Surrey ([PDF](http://www.surrey.ac.uk/sites/default/files/University-of-Surrey-Financial-Statements-2013-14.pdf)) then it appears that the surplus Orcnick refers to is £4.1m. The chancellor is not putting that in his pocket.

The University of Surrey, from that PDG, had an expenditure that year of £210.4m, on core activities, so that £4.1m of surplus is a drop in the ocean, and I'm pretty sure it's money they're putting in the bank for a rainy day.

If they have money in the bank, then that acts as protection when the tories make the next cuts to their budgets. As I understand it, the university has big mortgages on its halls (search ""gearing ratio"" in the PDF) and this surplus will act as a buffer when mortgage interest rates go up.

Personally, I commend the University of Surrey for building its own halls, as plenty of unis are encouraging the building of large student accommodations by corporate landlords, and abrogating themselves of responsibility for halls.

I think we'll have two formations: the diamond and our standard 4-2-3-1. For the diamond, I think it'll be Tabanou primarily starting in the back, because it is a more defensive formation and we need to make the most of our chances.

I think we'll start the year primarily using the 4-2-3-1, with Taylor starting at LB. He knows our system well and that's why he gets the nod.

By the middle of the year I think we'll see Ayew and Tabanou consistently starting together on the left (or Ayew near the top in the diamond). 

With the moves we've made we have solidified ourself in the ""next-best"" portion of the table, and I don't think there's any reason to believe we can't reach Europe if we stay healthy and our signings come off as intended.

Of course, that's a huge if, and we'll have to prove it on the field, but I love what we've done this summer. Éder is a huge question mark, and I'd still like to bring a ST in on loan.

And age doesn't play into factor unless your legs are going. So for him to be 21 and be so young, it doesn't matter about his age if he's quality, just like when Neymar was 21 he was a world beater, not to compare to the two.

And I believe Remy is good enough to start for a lot of PL teams including some top 4 teams like Arsenal and United (maybe), don't think City will start him because they have a quality side much like ours.

And for the sake of rotation. If one of our main attacking players is injured then we are in deep trouble. Why on earth would you want us to sign players like William Carvalho and Grzegorz Krychowiak? For fuck sake, they are Defensive Midfielders and that is the least of our worries. We already have Matic in that position and they are few other players that can replace him the few times he might be out. How are they going to improve our team? The position that we badly need to strengthen is central midfield area. Someone that can help us control the tempo of the match and help us keep position.

It can work in any competition if we focused just as much on cutting down passes as we do the offensive side of it. 

Aguero and silva can both pull their weight in shutting down passing lanes, they run tirelessly.  Bony will help a lot with that too. 

If we get Sterling or de Bruyne I'm not sure how much each of them can put in defensively but I hope they can each do their share of cutting down lanes.

null,false,Hammelj,eng-kent,Tonbridge,null,"At London's gatwick airport today, a person later discovered to be a teacher, was arrested trying to board a flight while in possession of a ruler, a protractor, a drafting triangle, a compass, and a calculator.

During a press conference the Attorney General said he believed the man was a member of the notorious al-Gebra movement and the FBI intends to charge him with transporting weapons of math instruction.

“Al-Gebra is a fearsum, transverse cult,” the Attorney General said. “As a group they seek means of average solutions by extremes, and sometimes randomly go off on tangents in search of absolute values. A member of al-Gebra may use acute alias such as ‘x’ or ‘y’ and refer to himself as an unknown identity, but we have determined that he is likely to belong to a common denominator — the axis of medieval that coordinates in every country.” The Attorney General continued, “Al-Gebra functions as a bunch of standard deviations that have been tribal since the time of Noah’s arc,” a remark that struck a chord with the media. “They are inordinate in terrorism, of that I’m abscissaly sure.

They use degrees of irrational subtrahend to create differences and conditional inequalities among friendly, discriminant nations, leading to arguments and making us less functional and coefficient in attaining our goals. And they have the international mobility of a swarm of loci. Give them an air matrix to inflate and a plot to set it on, and they can live anywhere. If necessary, we will pursue them to the corners of this Earthly sphere.”

He complemented this with the supplementary remark, “As the Greek philanderer Isosceles once said, ‘Never forget that there are three sides to every triangle, and sometimes two of them are normal.’ ” The attorney general added, “As you can tell, I am not diagonally opposed to that prime concept.”

When asked to comment on the arrest, David Cameron obtusely said, “If God had wanted us to have better weapons of math instruction, He would have given us more fingers and toes. Next to bisectual marriages and those polygonists in Utah, I’m concerned about the significant places of such weapons. Tomorrow I intend to go to the hill and address Congruence about this situation. I have a volume of suggestions and a finite series of common solutions for them to consider.”

The PM also warned, “These weapons of math instruction are without parallel and have the potential to decimal everything on a scalene never before seen unless we become exponents of an infinity Higher Power and begin to factor-in random facts of kindness. If we enter a phase in which all nations are integrated in all degrees of purpose, that steady state will give us slope for a better tomorrow, and we will all be infinitely better off. In such a case we could have our pi and eat it too.”

The PM further declared, “I am gratified that we have been given a sine that al-Gebra is protracting this situation with calculusing disregard. Their murky statisticians plan to inflict plane of new dimensions on every sphere of influence,” he added. “Under these circumferences, we must differentiate their roots, make our points, draw our lines, and proportionally intersect these people throughout whatever area of the domain they range. And, above all, we must make sure that they can’t get their hands on radii active materials. That is one thing you can secant you? What we need is a higher quotient of linguists embedded with our troops so that they can interpolate the gibberish that al-Gebra uses to communicate. If we had that capability, we could periodically reach new limits of success as easily as falling off a natural log. Anything short of that could lead to some real, not imaginary, complex circumstances.”

The home Secretary  added, “As our Great Leader would say, ‘Read my ellipse.’ The one angle that I am uncertainty of is that although al-Gebra will probability try to continuously multiply in theorem, their days are numbered as we draw the hypotenuse ever tighter around their necks.”

null,false,DawdlingDaily,null,null,null,"&gt;Arda Turan will be a good transfer, but I won't be happy if he is the only one (bar loaned Falcao). 

I think Turan would be an excellent addition to the squad. Like Essien in the past he is a top top utility player, who feels comfortable in 3 varying positions as attacking mid, box to box mid, and defensive mid. Unfortunately he is on the older side and lacks that marquee billing that we are all looking for in a signing this summer, but he would still be a fantastic siding allowing Jose more tactical flexibility and rotation. 

&gt;After winning double, grabbing Yokohama deal, TV rights, FFP compliant, and everything, if there is a season where we should expect big signings, this one is it.

Your spot on, this is the summer where it looks like we can write some big cheques for big name players. Unfortunately, I think the market doesn't have many world class/ marquee players in it, especially in regards to forwards and wingers. 

A quick look at the market:

**Bale** A dream and just that. He is not leaving Madrid quite yet.

**Reus** Would immediately make out attacking trio one of the best in the world, but who knows which way he'll blow next. 

**Pedro** just signed a new contract until 2019

**Muller** Never see him leaving Bayern, after all why would he want to

**Theo Walcott** Arsenal may be willing to sell him, he would add a nice threat to our attacking third, and he is homegrown, not quite a Reus or Bale but I wouldn't mind him.

**Antoine Griezmann** Would be quite a transfer if we get him, his development as a player reminds of where Hazard's was when we got him from Lille. He has all the tools but he's yet to become the master carpenter. 

**Carlos Vela** good winger, but lacks finishing

**Lucas** He was meant for big things when PSG signed him, hasn't quite lived up to the billing. At only 22 I would be interested to see how Mourinho would shape him and get him to fulfill his potential

**Icardi** A grade A cunt and grade A attacker, seems like the perfect match for us though I don't see Inter selling. 

**Sterling** at 50 million Liverpool can keep him. 

**Alexandre Lacazette** I really rate him especially coming off his fantastic performances last year, but he is a bit of a gamble. 

By all means the market doesn't seem to have much in the attacking/ forward positions. Just look at Bayern buying Douglas Costa, a fantastic player in my opinion, but lots of surprised reactions from people because he lacks that top billing that you would expect Bayern to go after.

As such I think this is one of the more interesting windows for our club. 

Will Jose and the board pursue proven talent in Griezmann, Reus, Walcott, and make a huge signing that shows our intent? 

Will we buy a stop gap like Turan? 

Will they hold off until the next window for more choice? 

Either way it will be interesting to sit back and see what the club does. ",null,0,null,1435793538,null,0,false,0,cspa92r,null,t3_3bshsp,null,t1_cspa92r,null,t1_csp34k6,null,null,null,1437507054,null,10,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,10,null

I've seen one or two people around here seeming to think he should be in defense full time but that's absolutely ludicrous. Actually really annoys me when I see people posting formations for next season and they have a back 3 again! That system clearly ran its course.

He was decent at the back, but if you actually think back to why he was so impressive was because of his composure, first touch, passing and general game intelligence. His actual defending like positioning, marking or tackling wasn't that good.

He might not be brilliant in midfield yet, but how is he supposed to improve there if he's stuck at centre back? If you're playing a 2 man midfield, or a midfield 3 without a true DM (which is likely with Rodgers) then Can is our best player for the spot.

I really like Lallana and I think he's a pretty special player when he's fit too, I just don't see one of those 3 being dropped unless they are injured or in some seriously terrible form.

Even if Firmino isn't playing striker and Sterling leaves, I'm not sure I trust us playing with a 2 man midfield of Milner and Henderson.  One of them will have to play from quite deep at that, which will seriously hamper the best parts of his game.  You could try dropping one of Coutinho or Lallana back into the midfield with the two of them, but then we're still extremely lightweight through the middle.

Yes, and I agree in terms of competitiveness or quality, is not anywhere near the PL. But you have to give Bamford his dues and know he's actually been great there, which leads me to believe he can be our third choice striker and learn from a great striker or striker (s) like Remy and Costa and show quality. 

Giving him his dues would be to loan him out so he can play regularly. Being third choice helps him in no way. He doesn't help us either. He isn't good enough to play for Chelsea yet. 

&gt;And age doesn't play into factor unless your legs are going. So for him to be 21 and be so young, it doesn't matter about his age if he's quality, just like when Neymar was 21 he was a world beater, not to compare to the two.

When he has zero experience with a big Club it does. He needs experience. He is young he needs to go get experience. And you hit the nail on the head when you said not to compare the two. Because they are miles a part in talent at 21. He isn't good enough. He won't gain what he needs sitting on the bench for us.  

&gt;And I believe Remy is good enough to start for a lot of PL teams including some top 4 teams like Arsenal and United (maybe), don't think City will start him because they have a quality side much like ours. 

That's where I think you are wrong and have over valued him.

&gt;And about people agreeing with opinions. It really depends on the person of course, and I believe you only agree on the points you think are reasonable and maybe factual, but anyone can be proved wrong if you haven't got solid points to justify the point you're making.

Basically my advice to you is literally don't put down any of your grades on your CV. Just say you have a degree and what it was in, you have A levels and what they were in, and you have X GCSEs that are A*-C (i don't explain this further as no one gives a shit any more but one sentence isn't too bad).

If you join  a profession that has it's own qualifications (like accountancy, being a solicitor etc) eventually your professional qualification and experience will be way more important. 

HOWEVER, the caveat I would add is you wont get to go straight from uni into really good companies as a rule. If I had applied to the firm I am with now straight out of uni, they would have reject me instantly for not having a 2.2, now I had some experience with big companies they leapt at the chance to give me a more senior role in the company than a grad. 

Essentially I'm maybe a year behind where I hypothetically could have been if I joined as a grad, but I wouldn't have chosen to do this anyway as I had no idea what it was so it's sort of irrelevant.

That isn't criticizing religion or Jews at least based on the article you linked, it is calling for their death. Replace the reference to Jews with Muslims or Koreans and ask yourself whether or not the idea expressed is still acceptable.

&gt;Imagine the reaction if you setup a whole fucking exhibition to mock them. There are pretty clear double standards here.

The exhibition isn't to mock Muslims, it is to depict a religious figure. Besides, you're free to mock Jews and they're free to respond to your mockery but not by threatening to kill you. The double standard is when someone is denied the freedom of expression because people are afraid of death threats.

&gt;The point is this isn't some depiction in a newspaper or satire mocking religion, this is literally set up as a big fuck you to Muslims, for no reason other than to provoke a reaction.

I think another reason is to express the freedom of self expression.

&gt; Lawbreaking is one of the difficulties of the debate for cyclists. The average person on a bike is arguably no more likely to break a law then their peer in a car. However, when they do so it’s more obvious, less normalised. People notice a cyclist pedalling through a red light, whereas speeding – which 80% of drivers admit to doing regularly – is often ignored, despite the immeasurably greater human cost this causes.

The range of conclusions are down to people being prejudiced, and the influence of a poisonous media campaign against cyclists. 

&gt; “What you see in discourses about cycling is the absolute classic 1960s and 1970s social psychology of prejudice,” he explains. “It’s exactly those things that used to be done about minority ethnic groups and so on – the overgeneralisation of negative traits, under-representation of negative behaviours by one’s own group, that kind of thing. It’s just textbook prejudiced behaviour.”

So your initial comment indicates that you ether didn't read, or simply failed to understand the article.

Also its worth remembering that up to 90% of cyclists also own cars, so the whole 'us vs them' perspective is even more idiotic.",null,0,null,1435798039,null,0,false,0,cspcp5x,null,t3_3bt3z2,null,t1_cspcp5x,null,t1_cspafag,null,null,null,1437509052,null,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7,null

Tabanou which I've gathered is best at offensive duties will start against teams we are believed to win against, but Taylor will start against stronger opposition. The Ayew signing has strengthened us on all fronts offensively, the growth of Grimes. Fulton, and  Barrow might be a strength coming next season, and the whole team's solidifying properties is what makes me believe we'll stand our ground coming next season. 


I expect someone to leave still, although I'm hoping not. The rumours going around about us signing a midfielder with experience tells that there's a possibility of us losing one. But the core remains, and the core is what got us here. 


The point being, there's not much restructuring in team in the team so far, and I think that'll be one of our strengths going in to the new season. The solidity and team spirit will remain, and the new signings will fit right in to the existent team, whilst others may try to hard to change everything.

null,false,sad_violin,lfc12,,null,"A lot of people are talking about really narrow formations with little to no defensive support for our fullbacks and no wingers. That doesn't work. A team doesn't narrow itself to victory in the EPL. 
My formation:
          Mignolet
Clyne Lovren/Skrtel Sakho Moreno
           Lucas/Can
Henderson Milner
        Coutinho
Sturridge (Other First Choice Striker (Benteke?))
This is a setup where Henderson and Milner will have to provide a lot of cover to the fullbacks, at times you'll see someone dropping back to support Lucas during slower buildup too. This formation will change from the diamond to a 42112 to a 4132 to a 433 quite often, and the systematic flexibility of the lineup will prove to be a key advantage when playing against the more tactically straightforward teams. If they decide to man mark anyone, a quick formation change can give the opposing manager a coronary (Pellegrini is looking pretty old now a days anyway, eh?). 


In cups and in Europe I expect to see a side drawn up more like
        Bogdan
Manquillo Toure Wisdom Moreno
      Rossiter Ilori
Markovic Firmino
        Ings Origi
You might be thinking to yourself, that's a relatively strong lineup to play for every cup game, and you'd be right. I can imagine Brendan using the cup games as an opportunity to develop a B squad that is more than capable of holding its own now that we have some actual depth. Whoever shines during the cup games gets a chance at the Premier League games on... sigh... Sunday. Rossiter's ability to break up play combined with Ilori's pace and a defense being marshalled by Toure has the potential to be a functional brick wall, especially against EL teams and lower league English sides. Furthermore, Origi and Markovic the are both threatening with their pace and ability. I can also imagine all of the forwards to rotate their positions throughout the game, causing chaos for opposing defenses hoping to shut down individual positions and players simultaneously. 

Both of these systems would require a tactically flexible team mentality, and an agreement by certain players to work their asses off on defense. Jordan Henderson is a huge threat when he's on the edge of the 18 yard box, so is Can, so is Milner, so is Firmino, so is yada yada yada, the list goes on and on. The trick is making it so that all of those players get their due opportunity in that area, and in order to do that, other players will have to drop further back to cover. I can see Milner especially playing a lot deeper than we were used to seeing him at Manchester City, especially if he's being deployed in a wider position (finally, Henderson doesn't have to be the only one covering the giant pocket of space in front of the RB!)

All in all, I think we're gonna see our sides struggle at the beginning of the season. The lineup is hard to figure out to everyone, including Brendan Rogers. The trick to success this season won't be figuring out the perfect starting 11, but instead, to make sure that each player has the team's ethos instilled in them so that they can contribute to functional and beautiful play. After the players adjust to that and figure out how to work together, who knows what our fucking lineups and formations will look like. All I know is I'm looking forward to it.

But we really don't know if he isn't good enough for us. I see his flaws and where it might not work out but hell I'll give him a chance at least. It's a loan. Not much of an investment.

I disagree, like you, that bringing in another striker is sending any sort of nefarious message to Kane. In fact, knowing what kind of a player he is, it should, hopefully, spur him on to even greater heights.

Going back to my point, we aren't Chelsea. They can afford having Costa on £150k/week as well as Remy, who has had a measly 851 minutes this season, on £70k/week. Our needs for a second striker are very specific. They have to be willing to come for much lower wages and be satisfied with being second fiddle to Kane since it's unlikely that Poch will change to a two striker system.

Chicha has played at United and Real. We are pretty much dwarfed either one of them. The wages they give to their backups and youngsters can match our highest earners, and still with plenty to spare. It's not that they are loose handed and love spending money for the sake of it, it's just that they can and if large wages prevent a smaller club like us from picking up a quality player such as Chicha, then they'd gladly offer him wages too large for us to match.

Complete fallacy. People who want to go to London aren't going to fly to Birmingham. This has been tried in many places, with airports constructed for political rather than practical reasons, and they sit empty.

London has six airports, most if not all of which have lower fees, but Heathrow is the one with capacity problems as that is where most airlines want to fly to. The obvious solution is to expand Heathrow.

&gt;People are so London centric it's ridiculous.

That's because this thread is about capacity at Heathrow. It's about capacity *for London*. The rest of the country just isn't relevant to how to best increase needed capacity *for London*.

If we were discussing traffic congestion in London would you suggest measures to ease traffic congestion in Manchester? Surely if we make Manchester a jam-free paradise ""people will come"", right?

&gt;Furthermore, there is the rest of the damned country to consider - Manchester is reaching bursting point, Liverpool is starting to head that way.

If Manchester needs expanding, then expand Manchester too. There's no reason you can't do both, these expansions should ultimately be self-funding and profitable, but this thread is about capacity issues for London.

&gt;Germany has it down to a tee - regional hubs, regional spread of power, no one city has too much. Berlin, political symbolic hub, Frankfurt financial hub, Hamburg shipping and trade hub, Munich engineering and manufacturing hub.

Yes, and Germany naturally has that population distribution, likely because it used be independent states that only unified a little over a hundred years ago. England, which is the vast majority of the UK, has been a unitary state for a thousand.

If you look at France, long a unitary state, it is the same. In fact it is worse. Paris is slightly larger than London and France's population slightly higher overall but the UK then has three cities (Manchester, Birmingham and Leeds Bradford) that are larger than the second largest city in France (Lyon).

Look at Italy, same as Germany, less centralised, many major cities of similar population. You know why that is?

&gt;Whereas with folks like you all it is is LONDON LONDON LONDON. Change the record, grandpa.

That's where the people are, that's where the businesses are and that's where people want to fly to. You can complain about centralisation and propose measures to counter it all you like but there is no point in a thread specifically about a problem of airport capacity *for London* piping up with ""why don't we build it somewhere else entirely"".",null,0,null,1435805098,null,0,false,0,cspgfh3,null,t3_3bq3v3,null,t1_cspgfh3,null,t1_cspa0f4,null,null,null,1437512171,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

Now take an episode of Planet Earth, a high viewership, high budget, reputable documentary.  I'm going to guess that this is the sort of thing you don't mind paying for, but if not, eh, it's probably representative.

Again, look at Strictly Come Dancing; £400000 an episode in 2014, regularly servicing between 10 and 15 million viewers.  About four pence an episode.  I couldn't even begin to estimate what they've paid in licensing alone for Glastonbury coverage.

Depends on what the Bank of England does to the base rate and what competition in the mortgage market is like.

null,false,jdhan2006,lfc68,,null,"I'm not so sure.  On paper yes, City and United are better but both clubs have significant problems.  

City seems to be keeping Pellegrini until Pepe leaves Bayern so he really has nothing to gain or lose, on top of being relatively average as a manager.  City relies on Aguero's fitness which is never going to give a full season, but with Bony coming in they should be a little better.  But they are an aging squad with real problems in defense.  They are streaky and not at all the dominant side of a few years ago.  City rely on the talent of the players alone not any real tactical acumen or philosophy.  

United while again on paper seem to be better I'm not so sure they are guaranteed top four.  DeGea was a big part of their success last season and he looks to be leaving.  They still need to address the striker situation, left back, GK if DDG leaves, CB's and Carrick replacement.  And they may run into the same problems most teams do when they replace a large percentage of their starting XI, disjointed play.  

They will be in CL next season and probably won't be bounced from the cups in the early stages again so they will have a rougher schedule than last season.  They played shitty ball for periods and looked the best when they lumped it to Felliani.  They could still have RvP on their books unless someone wants to pay his wages but given his form it look unlikely that will happen.  

I'm sure they (United) will make good signings this window, as with City, but Arsenal and Chelsea are bang on looking scary and Liverpool aren't without problems ourselves but LFC have a philosophy, stability, youth that are experienced and hunger.

We need to buy smart, but there are some players who are just worth the splurge in a cost/risk analysis.  The amount of money we paid for Lamela and Soldado was not totally outrageous in terms of what they could've done for us.  That neither of them ended up being worth it doesn't mean we should just give up on higher value purchases altogether.  I mean, it took City a number of seasons buying players like Robinho and Javi Garcia before they hit upon a winning transfer formula.

I implemented various reversible encryption approaches in javascript for NHS numbers using readily available libraries.

The idea of writing a message encryption program on a calculator doesn't sound particularly challenging.  Prompt for key, message, choice of encryption method and run library code adapted to the language the calculator uses (if it's not [available already online](http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/254/25499.html)).

So the work I did, or the work I proposed above both create an application which will strongly encrypt a message in the manner which Cameron is discussing.

[Here's an example](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt-nodejs) of how to do strong encryption in javascript using a library.  It's trivial to copy that library into your page and make a call to it, but doing so and having it send a message would be targeted here since it creates an encrypted form of communication that cannot be broken by the government.

Extract relating to the new stadium:
&gt;...In order to address this difference, FSG plan to expand Anfield in much the same way they successfully redeveloped the Fenway Park Stadium for one of their other clubs, US baseball team the Boston Red Sox. The plan is to expand the Main Stand capacity by 8,300 seats taking the overall Anfield capacity to around 54,000, which should be complete for the 2016/17 season. Potentially, there would also be a further increase of 4,800 seats in the Anfield Road stand at a later date.

&gt;It is estimated that this would increase revenue by £25 million: £20 million from the extra seats and (an ambitious) £5 million for naming rights for the stand (though importantly the club would keep the famous Anfield name for the stadium as a whole). The additional seat income is largely driven by 4,500 corporate seats, which Ayre says is vital for the plan’s viability: “Corporate hospitality revenues are essential. This means we will pay the debt back quickly… while increasing revenues into the playing squad.”

&gt;Including the cost of acquiring the land, this project will cost well over £100 million, but it is likely to be funded by an interest-free loan from the owners, thus eliminating the need to make steep interest payments, as Arsenal are still doing for their Emirates Stadium.

&gt;This all sounds very promising, as relatively low match day income has long been Liverpool’s Achilles’ heel, but every silver lining has a cloud and there has been much concern among supporters’ groups about ticket prices. Season tickets have risen by around 10% over the last few years, which is more than other leading clubs. Liverpool chairman Tom Werner is clearly aware of the fans’ discontent: “We are committed to working towards a tiered solution at Anfield, so there are affordable tickets as well as tickets that are higher priced.” We shall see. Certainly the new TV deal should give clubs the opportunity to address ticket prices.",null,0,null,1435818391,null,0,false,0,cspm67a,null,t3_3bty7j,null,t1_cspm67a,null,t3_3bty7j,null,null,null,1437516573,null,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6,null

atleast 24% think violence is justified, it doesn't mean they are violent themselves but that when an attack like Paris happens, they agree with the attackers because islam was disrespected.

the first link I posted shows a poll were 78% of british muslims said they wanted a cartoonist prosecuted over a drawing, that is a clear threat to free speech.

whether the government is a bigger problem is irrelevant to muslims also being one.

I see this as most people (about 1/3 of the people who voted so not really most) as thinking that their lot would be better at the direct expense of people less fortunate than themselves (remember most of this stuff was in the Tory manifesto)  That's selfish in my book.

People hire people. People prefer to hire awesome people. People also work with people. Don't submit a boring cv because nobody wants to work with someone boring. If you do awesome things, make sure the recruiter or employer knows about it. At the same time, this is a professional document, so make sure you relate how awesome you are back to his awesome you are professionally.

How do you tie this stuff together to show you will be great at the job you are applying for? You tailor each CV to each job. Have the same base information, but each job posting and person spec will have different wording of the candidate they are looking for. Simply relate what makes you awesome to what the employer/recruiter is looking for. If they say their ideal candidate has a superb eye for detail, what, from your list of awesome, can you relate to that? Find it and write it down, and relate it to that specific quality. 

Hates: ""references available on request"" . Just put them on the cv and make it as easy as possible for the recruiter to contact your references.

He still has some of the problems that stopped the biggest clubs from dropping a lot of money on him at Ajax - he can be quite inconsistent. For us, that's basically fine - even when he's not playing well, he's probably always in our best 5 players on the pitch. In his defence, we sorely need some cover for him, as fatigue probably played a part - but then again, it has been a criticism made against him for a while; that he goes missing during games.

He has unbelievable talent and ability, but whether he'll ever become world class remains to be seen. I know we like to throw that word around a lot, but I'd say you have to be in, say, the top 10 players in your position to be considered world class - and he isn't, yet.

That being said, he has definitely made improvements year on year. But, you can't help but wish that he'd grab the game by the scruff of the neck and truly dictate the pace of a game - like Modric often did for us. He's definitely capable, and whist his attitude is good and calm, you can't help but think some genuine competition (something he didn't really have at Ajax or for us since Siggy left) would help to get the best out of him.

The reason it worked for Atleti is because of Simeone's system where *everyone* has defensive responsibilities, not just the backline and center mids, can't tell you how many times Turan and Garcia have tackled someone right outside the box. As players they're also much better at defending than ours, especially our wide midfielders, so it does have more to do with the squad we have at our disposal, and with targets like Pogba, Sterling and KdB it doesn't look like it'll change. We did well with it the previous season, but our defensive problems, of which there were already plenty of, have been further exposed since, especially in the midfield where many goals against us this season have been started, teams have done homework and as soon as Fernandinho lets his guard down or goes far forward they absolutely eat up Yaya there.

The 4-2-3-1 admittedly doesn't fix our defensive woes per say, but it helps by pressing the midfielders further down and relieve them a bit of going forward with a central attacking midfielder's presence. What it does best is make our attack a ton better though. It puts Silva further up and more centrally in the pitch where he's at his best, and it's nothing short of fantastic for counters, using it at the end of the season we were the best counter-attacking team in the league. 

Either way, I'm aware Pellegrini is likely to stick to what he knows because of his stubborness, but if you look at our targets, particularly De Bruyne who doesn't fit in a 4-4-2, it might not be for him to decide anymore.",null,0,null,1435823819,null,0,1435840538,0,cspntfu,null,t3_3bsbwy,null,t1_cspntfu,null,t1_csp7xdq,null,null,null,1437517890,null,2,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,2,null

There are many reasons why Farron would make an excellent leader, non of which are really made in this article. 

Also i take some issue with this part ""Mr Lamb has highlighted Mr Farron’s faith, saying it led him to positions on gay marriage, abortion, and assisted suicide which are illiberal."" Im pretty sure Lamb has never said any such thing.

I can see why people may oppose spoons based on that. But honestly, I think ""popping down the pub for a pint"" is on its way out, at least with the younger generations. I certainly never go to a pub if there's no food involved. I tried to support my local once, they had a big sign out front saying ""local food served hot"" so I went in, asked to see a menu and was told they didn't serve food! I told them they need to update their sign then and left. Haven't been back since.

&gt;No character, like McDonald's with beer

I'll give you that, a mixed grill from one spoons is pretty much going to be exactly the same as one at the other end of the country! Personally I'd argue that can be a good thing though, because people like consistency. Plus the spoons near me and the ones I've been to out and about always seem to be built into some converted old building unique to whatever town its in which I think gives each one an individual character, which makes up for the same-y food. The one near me used to be a friary, I've also been to ones built into an old theater and one that I think used to be a bath house!

&gt;Meh food and beer

*shrug* You get what you pay for? They're generally very cheap for a reason. But I'm always full after one of their meals and it's not the *worst* food that's out there. Can't speak on the beer as I'm not really a beer person, and I'm usually driving.

Only downside is that it is continually pulling in hot air and cooling it, rather than recirculating the air in the room - although that's also a plus since we get fresh air.

If you change lenders it *is* ""ending the mortgage and getting another"".  If you stay with the same lender then it can be a much lighter weight process.

&gt; In addition I agree with Ben Franklin's statement: ""They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.""

This gets thrown around a lot and I broadly agree with the sentiment
but again nothing is that black and white. You and I as citizens of the UK (assuming you are) *already* sacrifice elements of our liberty for safety. We don't have unlimited free speech, we can't buy guns, can't make explosives, can't incite violence. The idea that freedom is all or nothing is over-simplistic. Again there is a balance to be struck.

&gt; Banning encryption would make 0 difference. How many companies in the States conform to the CFR15.7C restriction on exports of encryption software &gt; 128b as munitions? Er, none, because it's completely unenforceable.

As I said, it would make it illegal to download things like whatsapp in their current form. Would that make it impossible for people to download them illegally? Of course not. Would it make it more difficult? Of course it would. That's not a zero difference, although it may well be very small.

&gt; I'll be long gone by the day that pulling apt-get install openssl on my server earns me a knock at the door by the security services.

Not sure what you mean by that

&gt; Under an encryption ban, considering the restrictions you yourself propose

Again I'm not proposing it, I'm stating the opposite case

&gt; That gets into the wrong hands and the potential is there for multiple £b of damage. Do you not see the problem?

Yes I do and it may be that the technical challenges make it un-economical. On the other hand are you really saying you can't see any way around that issue? eg. using a third party encryption service who hold private keys.

&gt; Understatement of the century.

It may well be. And if things stay as they stand it could seriously hamper it. On the other hand if all governments brought out a similar measure (and you can bet they're thinking about it) it would probably generate more jobs in trying to innovate around the ban.

&gt; I disagree. The opposition is split. Labour and the SNP are at each others' throats constantly. If anything, it's in the Tories' best interests if they want this to go through to do this as quickly as possible while the dust settles on the opposition benches.

Tell you what, in a year's time if there's a ban on strong encryption I'll give £50 to charity. Will you make the same commitment?

&gt; So yeah. No. Don't defend this move. It's stupidity of the highest order.

Again pissy tone unnecessary. I personally believe that nothing should be beyond debate.

First off, if you go off work sick (or are on JSA and get sick) and get a sick note you will not be getting any extra money. Unless your company pays sick pay you will be getting the basic sickness benefit, which is the same as job seekers.

Secondly getting onto the work related activity group on ESA (the group this change will affect) is not a case of opting in, or how long you have been sick. You will need to pass a medical carried out by ATOS or Maximus - which, as I am sure we are all aware is no rubber stamp.

So what we are left with is a group of people who are very ill, but not so ill that they couldn't work at all. It may well be that they would require the employer to provide some sort of physical arrangement for them, or be prepared to expect them to be off work sick more often than a well employee.

This would probably be the most likely reason that they are finding it difficult to be employed, not a lack of trying. cutting this money is unlikely to change that - and in the scheme of things I don't think it's likely to be a particularly high saving anyway.",null,0,null,1435828068,null,0,false,0,cspovm0,null,t3_3bujgy,null,t1_cspovm0,null,t3_3bujgy,null,null,null,1437518749,null,24,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,24,null

But American soccer fans are kind of annoying (says the American soccer fan), because you've got four really annoying groups of people that are all present at WC time. Both genders, as the US cares far more about the women's WC than anywhere else as far as I can tell. 

The casual I only watch the World Cup group, which exists in every country. in England, it's ""Why can't Rooney score goals in every game?"" ""Why did they blow the whistle there?"" ""What's offside!"" And, for 2010...""Haha, America doesn't even play football, we'll smash you!"" (Err, yeah, how did that work out?)

You've also got the ""I studied abroad for a semester in Barcelona/London/Italy, and now I'm a true connoisseur of the beautiful game as embodied by Lionel Messi and the UEFA Champions League, which I like to watch on my phone at my tech internship. Here, smell my Barcelona scarf. Mes que un club!"" fan. These are the Eurosnobs that American fans complain about, because they think MLS and the US team (although that is changing) are for prole Republicans.

Then you've got the backlash to number two, who are the people who think the best MLS teams are only a step or two down from Manchester City, think Tim Howard is one of the three best goalkeepers in the world, and 'murrrica it up. That said, they are also the main reason US men's national team games in the USA aren't away games for the Yanks any more, so they aren't all bad.

Finally, you've got the last and arguably single most annoying group of fans, the ""Mexico foreverrrrrr"" sector. These are people whose grandparents come from Mexico, and endlessly talk shit to US national team fans in between runs to Taco Bell and/or Chipotle. A quick shout of ""Dos a cero!"" shuts them up, since the US team has a fantastic track record of beating Mexico in key games by 2-0, and because they don't know what it means, as they don't speak any Spanish. They also aren't too present in this WC as none of them give a shit about the Mexican women's team. 

But, you know, it's cool. Did you hear the Canadian crowd for the quarter final? They didn't have a fucking clue what was going on half the time, and that was where US soccer was 20 (21, actually) years ago - watch a game from the 1994 World Cup and wow, the crowd's got no idea what was going on. It's a lot different now, we've definitely moved on from that.

2 problems. First, you are either being very flippant about what a buy-to-let investment is, or it has been described to you improperly (presumably by the financial advisor). It is not free money (otherwise literally everyone would do it), and it comes with risk. your earnings are relatively low (understandable as your business is quite new), and i would question your ability to pay 1 mortgage, let alone 2 if your tenant decides to move out and you don't find a new one.  that's just one of the risks..

Second problem is that your financial advisor has recommended you put a lot of money into property, a small amount of money into a pension, and any money at all into gilts. I don't know you, and i didn't overhear the conversation you had with the IFA, but i find it really hard to understand why you'd recommend someone young enough to be living with his parents to invest in very low risk government bonds that probably pay less interest than your bank accounts.",null,0,null,1435828652,null,0,false,0,cspp0gw,null,t3_3btbr6,null,t1_cspp0gw,null,t1_cspo3s0,null,null,null,1437518828,null,9,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,9,null

This isn't about calls and texts - calls don't work quite like the internet, and LE/int can already surveil calls easily and in a targeted way.

Text is easy - it's the internet problem, but orders of magnitude smaller.

&gt;How on Earth do they get what they're looking for?

It's actually easy and doable with current technology.

You basically store a record of connections, and automatically sift through it all looking for, whatever you want. In the terrorist example, you don't know your terrorists's IP address, so it's actually a slightly different problem. What they want to do (probably are already doing tbh) is have a look at all internet traffic as it whooshes past, and if the traffic contains something that tips them off that it pertains to an intelligence target (naughty terrorist) then they start recording that stream, and probably start hoovering up everything from the same source IP.

&gt;How many people do they employ to read inane bullshit all day? 

You've misunderstood. There aren't men in suits sitting with a cup of tea perusing your facebook chats - it's all done automatically, with software - I'm reasonably confident they're using hadoop, I'd bet money on it, cause there's not really any other way to achieve it on this scale. We know from Snowden leaks that  xkeyscore uses mapReduce, which strongly points to hadoop, and GCHQ are probably doing the same, if not actually just using the same system or borrowing the source code.

&gt;How do they store it all?

The hardware is cheap, and you can use commodity servers for hadoop, because it's very fault tolerant, so that makes it even cheaper. 1 server cabinet can comfortably give you over a petabyte of storage space (more if you go out of your way to cram in as much as possible), and hadoop scales easily, so you just keep adding more racks when you need more space. In a small room, the size of a typical child's bedroom, you could fit maybe 8 petabytes. In a medium size data centre space you could maybe have ~100 petabytes to 1 exabyte, and in big data centres, you're basically limited by your electricity supply, but you can have as much space as you want, in theory. 

&gt;What do they benefit from knowing Mavis from Manchester is making a brew? Or Baz from Crawley is taking a massive dump? 

This is precisely why privacy advocates don't like it - because it infringes on the privacy of individuals for no good reason. The cost is too high for the benefit - even if it did enable LE to catch a few terrorists (99% chance it won't).

&gt;Because I can tell you now, if they're looking for random messages talking about blowing places up, they'll have a hard time if they don't already have names.

You'd be swamped with false positives from all the idiots on social media talking about blowing shit up, agreed.


&gt;And even if they do have names of known terrorists and are tracking their communications, why do they need ALL of our data?

This is a technical limitation of how the internet works. Specifically, encrypted internet communication. Let's take a simple facebook example. 

a) I don't know the terrorists' source IP(s)

b) All traffic to facebook from UK users is encrypted [assumption, not necessarily accurate]

c) I want to know when someone has a facebook chat in which they say ""lol i can't wait to blow up a london bus because I'm a terrorist""

In order to solve this problem - I need to be able to read *all* facebook messages, because I don't know which ones contain what I'm after, and I don't know who I'm after. Since all the traffic is encrypted, I have to decrypt all of it, to be able to look at what's inside, to then check if it contains the message I'm looking for. If you knew of a particular person you wanted to spy on, you could target only them, by getting a warrant to make their ISP hand over their IP address/traffic etc, but the scenario they're trying to address is where you don't know who to spy on, so you spy on everyone, to decide who you should spy on more. A name alone might not be enough to justify getting a targeted warrant in many cases, so again, they want to spy on everyone, then decide who's a bad guy - no more innocent until proven guilty, they're pushing the idea that you're unknown until proven known good/bad, and that that's not acceptable.",null,0,null,1435828889,null,0,1435829170,0,cspp2dz,null,t3_3bqs5q,null,t1_cspp2dz,null,t1_cspemt7,null,null,null,1437518874,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Henderson : Best of the bunch. Still you wouldn't rely on him to control a game. Has a great engine and can play in good balls but for me he shouldn't be the best midfielder of a side aspiring to win the league. 

Can : Green. I prefer if he is a libero. He has potential but I wonder where he fits in. He isn't a DM, so I assume he'll be a box to box player as well. 

Allen : Has 5 good games a season. Steady. But nothing spectacular. 

Lucas : past his prime. Best DM at the club though which doesn't say a lot. 

Milner : Mostly plays wide. Haven't seen him as a midfielder much.

Either we should get in more creativity from midfield or add a DM to let Henderson and Can wander.
