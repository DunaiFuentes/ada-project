&gt; Avoid the on-road tram routes. If you can't avoid them, take extreme care when crossing the tramlines especially if you are on a road bike with thin wheels. Tram stops are a particular problem - slow down or stop, check behind, signal to on-coming traffic that you are going to move out, and cross the tracks at an angle of at least 45 degrees .

No the media in no way reflects the reality of prison and is generally utterly clueless when speaking about issues relating to it. 

The day of sentencing is utterly horrible. You know it's inevitable, you have some idea of the range of sentencing options but no real notion of what the judge will end up taking into account when delivering a tariff. You do get a copy of the judges written reasoning for the length of sentence a few months into your term. Some people use those as grounds for appeal if they're contentious. My sentence was longer than I'd hoped but shorter than I could have got. 

Arriving is overwhelming, frightening, a totally novel experience. First timers with longer sentences are usually kept on observation until they're certain you're not going to do anything self harming. 

Release is weird. Again pretty stressful as you worry about all the things that could potentially stop you getting out and anticipating all the stuff you want to do when you get out. Right up until they actually let you out the door you think it might not happen. As you're driving away you just want to get away as quickly as possible. It takes weeks for all the tension you have built up over the years inside starts to slip away. There's loads of times you will dream you're still inside and wake up relieved to see it's not your cell. The experience will definitely leave it's mark 

Did prison work for me? I don't think it did anything to rehabilitate me that a decent programme of counselling would have. The whole experience did make me take better care of my mental health and not bottle things up that could lead to problems down the line.

I don't have any answers or great insight into whether or not our prison system is good or bad. I think northern European models seem to do a better job in rehabilitation and cutting recidivism but it takes a brave politician to resist the urge for punishment over rehabilitation. 

One area I'd like to see addressed is the rehab of offenders act and the impact of disclosure on employment prospects. How that's done will need smarter people than me looking at it.

We're playing Monopoly.  You have a blue property, a red, a green, but most importantly two of the orange set.  The first and the third.  As a bonus you have enough cash that you could build up all three to three houses each.  That's the sweet spot for income for expenditure.

I have the other orange.  You want it, obviously.  You're not going to sell me the two oranges.  You ask me what I want for it and I tell you I want the red and the green **and** £100!

You'll probably agree to the trade though.

The idea that it ""represents local people"" is an illusion.

The idea of ""representing an area"" is stupid anyway. It's almost a divide and rule strategy by erecting artifical electoral boundaries between people.

The current system means a region specific party will ultimately get the largest minority of votes there and unjustly force everyone else out (see SNP) while sensible nationwide parties with significant support but not concentrated in any particular area will be hugely unrepresented (see Lib Dems, UKIP, Greens).

Ireland is the best example, free 3rd level education completely changed the entire country. Previous to that, people who couldn't afford it had government support available, but it just wasn't ""the done thing"".

However at this point, that barrier is gone, and the current UK fee system is actually relatively fair, higher earner pay back more, lower earners may never pay back.

However, I think this whole part of your post is a bad path for a society to go down:

&gt;Why is it that a poor family should pay, via their taxes, for the someone who has received private education to go to university? Why should families who can afford to send their children to university for full fees be subsidised by tax payers?

Why should families who can afford to send their children to private primary school be subsidised by taxpayers? Why should people who can afford private health insurance be subsidised by tax payers? 

It's a can of worms to use that argument - and ignores that the rich family would still be taxpayers.

The short answer to your core questions is that a more highly educated society means a society with the ability to make more money. Certain things in society are completely essential but not used by everyone to the same extent.

&gt;

&gt;The __2015–16 UEFA Europa League__ will be the 45th season of [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe)'s secondary club [football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) tournament organised by [UEFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA), and the 7th season since it was renamed from the UEFA Cup to the [UEFA Europa League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League).

&gt;The [2016 UEFA Europa League Final](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_UEFA_Europa_League_Final) will be played at the [St. Jakob-Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Jakob-Park) in [Basel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel), Switzerland. 

&gt;[Sevilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sevilla_FC) are the two-time defending champions. As they automatically qualified for the [2015–16 UEFA Champions League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015%E2%80%9316_UEFA_Champions_League) group stage as the Europa League title holders, they will not be able to defend their title unless they finish third in the group stage.

In all honesty it was so bad that sometimes I forget we even got CL this season. Rodgers speaks to much, and it always bites him back. Giving him another year is like diving head first into an empty swimming pool. If we cant attract players to the club with CL, it has to come down to what does the player want more? A top manager or/and more money. Since we are not the club to pay those wages, the last thing we have to attract players are trophies, or a top manager. We have no trophies, so it comes down to the manager. Do you think a world class player from the top 3 or 4 teams in the major leagues in Europe would think of BR as a world class manager?

It's as if you stopped reading after ""inexperienced."" Obviously Pep is vastly experienced in football, and as you said, has accomplished some of the greatest things you can in football. But that doesn't mean he has any experience at a club where he can't just go out and buy virtually any player in the world to fit his system. If you think that Swansea or Newcastle aren't totally different jobs that require some totally different talents than Barca, then you're kidding yourself.

&gt;Then that's just showing a lack of ambition on the part of Liverpool's fans. It's sad. 

This is the classic catch-22 for all Liverpool supporters. If we are realistic about the fact that we can't compete with Chelsea and City using the same methods that they do (which are far easier), then we show no ambition. If we talk about competing for the title and consistent CL football, then we get called deluded and accused of living in the past (as you have yourself done). There is no way to win as Liverpool fans.

Unfortunately, football supporters who don't have their heads up their ass understand that wage bills directly correlate to league positions. [As the 6th highest wage bill in the EPL](http://www.tsmplug.com/football/premier-league-player-salaries-club-by-club/), while still losing a few million each year, or maybe breaking even, we cannot hope to challenge for the title consistently. When revenues get close to the top 3, then Liverpool should be competing. At the moment, though, the reality is that Liverpool is a top 6 club, not top 4, and we have expectations that come with one of the elite clubs in world football without the other tools needed to meet them. The sooner fans understand the true context of the club now, the better, in my opinion.",null,0,null,1433131310,null,0,false,0,crriw98,null,t3_37y712,null,t1_crriw98,null,t1_crrfkgv,null,null,null,1433509519,null,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null

Smith's isn't as flamboyant as Tennant's in that he doesn't wear his emotions on his sleeve. With Smith you have to really pay attention to how he says things, both in his wording and his delivery. There's a lot of meaning in the pauses he takes, and the way he'll answer difficult questions in a round about way. His face is also very expressive, and he can convey several emotions in a very quick amount of time. Smith is very good at subtly conveying drama. But don't think that makes him morose, those things that make him great for subtle drama are also great for comedy. His facial reactions to something a little uncomfortable or awkward are hilarious. And again more of the humor comes from what isn't said than what is said.

As for edgy, he is arguably one of the more dangerous Doctors. He is willing to manipulate someone to get something he wants more than 9 or 10 would.

But when I first started watching football, one of the first matches I watched was the 1-0 win over Manchester United in 2006. That caught my interest, and so I started to learn more about the club. The history, the titles, the successes (such as 1967), and the struggles. I quickly fell in love. My great-grandmother was a Scottish immigrant to Canada, my great-grandfather an Irish immigrant to the United States, I grew up in a Catholic family. There was so much about this club that seemed to reflect my own identity.

As I learned more about this club, I also learned more about Rangers. I'm a bit of a fanatic when it comes to sports, so I bought into the rivalry right quick. And seeing the dirty style of play they employed on the field at times intensified that dislike for Rangers... and watching them win 3 straight SPL titles began to turn that into absolute hatred for me. I honestly hate Rangers, and I too wish that organization a quick death...

...unless it hurts the club I have come to love so much. And while I was originally celebrating the terrible situation at Ibrox, these last few years have left a sour taste in my mouth. Players seem to be leaving more and it seems harder to get top players in, and I think that boils down to 2 things: an apparent lack of a challenge (I think I could manage Celtic to a Premiership title without Rangers in the league) leaves players with no motivation to stay/come, and a probable loss of revenue due to the absence of Rangers (in terms of marketing and advertising contracts, etc...

null,false,AutoNiggaBot,null,null,null,"&gt; This is the classic catch-22 for all Liverpool supporters. If we are realistic about the fact that we can't compete with Chelsea and City using the same methods that they do (which are far easier), then we show no ambition. If we talk about competing for the title and consistent CL football, then we get called deluded and accused of living in the past (as you have yourself done). There is no way to win as Liverpool fans.
&gt; Unfortunately, football supporters who don't have their heads up their ass understand that wage bills directly correlate to league positions. As the 6th highest wage bill in the EPL, while still losing a few million each year, or maybe breaking even, we cannot hope to challenge for the title consistently. When revenues get close to the top 3, then Liverpool should be competing. At the moment, though, the reality is that Liverpool is a top 6 club, not top 4, and we have expectations that come with one of the elite clubs in world football without the other tools needed to meet them. The sooner fans understand the true context of the club now, the better, in my opinion.

Beaverbank is pretty far from the main campus (about 40 mins walk up a hill and through the busy centre if you walk at a calm pace) and the bus service (primarily a number 8 bus) was infrequent and often so busy in the morning that you couldn't even get on, which meant you were possibly going to be late/miss class. Getting a student bus card was definitely recommended!

null,false,MyreMyalar,null,null,null,"No they won't because you have a 'potential migrant pool' with a declining fertility rate and a native population, also with a declining fertility rate. Years of 'uncontrolled' immigration have given us a good sample at the kind of rates that people from elsewhere in the EU come to the UK and it's pretty easy to project those rates forward and by the time we've imported enough young people to push the fertility rate upward the potential pool's fertility rate has also declined to the point where new young people no longer have a boosting effect. In other words the process has diminishing returns but it's good for the UK that we've managed to (and will continue to) ring some benefits out of it, Japan took the opposite path and had very low immigration and now their demographic timebomb will be much larger and harder to deal with.

with housing you have supply and demand yes, but given that immigration (i.e. demand) brings economic benefits in the short and medium terms it seems far more sensible to increase supply than to try and hurt our country by slashing demand. It's like looking at a group of starving people and saying 'well we could feed them... or we could have them all killed. Both would solve the problem, so a mix of the two would be even more effective! Lets kill half and feed the rest'. Sometimes splitting the difference and picking the 'middle' path isn't wisdom.

We already do control immigration. The EU itself functions as an immigration control system. Only people that get into the club are allowed to freely move within it, right now it takes a very long time for new countries to join and they are added in ones and twos so the medium term impact can be assessed. We can look back and see what has happened and it turns out that all 503 million people in the EU don't flock to the UK. It turns out that the vast majority of people like to stay in their own countries and those that do migrate have a range of different options. Some like to catch the sun and migrate south (old people in the UK), some like to get good jobs and migrate north (Germany, Scandinavia, UK, France). Countries in the EU tend to see a boost to their economies over time and often economic immigrants will start to go back the other way.

In simple terms, you sign up to a bookmakers, place a bet in order to qualify for their free bet ""outcome A"", then you sign up to a betting exchange and ""lay"" the same bet - effectively betting that outcome A won't happen.

So no matter what, you'll ""win"" at either the bookmakers or the exchange, with only a loss of a few pence due to slight difference in odds.

Now comes the free bet, and you do exactly the same, except now the bet isn't your own money, so when it settles, you've made a guaranteed profit.  Repeat over 30-40 bookmakers. 

Then you have the option of multiple accounts, but there's other offers those same bookmakers will make to keep you as a ""punter"" which you can also take advantage of.  Its not gambling since you bet of both outcomes.  Gambling is a mugs game.

null,false,AnxiousMo-Fo,,Labour | Check out /r/LabourUK!,null,"So people are desperate to opt-out but they won't do so because they have to - gasp - *fill out a form?* Where is this demand to have to opt-in coming from? Union members? No, it's coming from the government.

&gt;But some unions make it all or nothing. Want non partisan campaigning? Tough, the political fund is there for the Labour Party. Want to move unions to one that doesn't support Labour? Tough, as your employer only recognises us

I've already pointed out that there are a number of ways you could avoid paying money to the Labour Party and still belong to whatever union you want. The Tories are doing this to make both the Labour Party and union campaigning ineffective. That is unfair given that they're still happy for any other kind of group to campaign.

&gt; Unite? ""Numbers of unions"" is simply playing with statistics - it's how much money and how many members that covers, that really matters

So your logic here is, because some big unions have an optional additionall fee for Labour affiliation, no unions should have an opt-out for their political fund. I don't know if it's just me, but it seems like you're missing a few steps there.

&gt;They should probably ask for their money back, given the NHS privatisations Labour pushed through

How is this relevant to the argument? If anything, this is an argument for *more* union influence on Labour policy.

&gt;A huge issue with the argument is that no one has made a case for why it shouldn't be opt in.

That's *not* the argument. I have no problem with it being opt-in. Unions are democratic, member-run organisations. If they want it to be opt-in, it can be. What I have a problem with is the government *forcing* us to make it an opt-in. That's completely different.

&gt;There's just cries of how the Labour Party will lose money, or how it is politically motivated (interesting how Labour doesn't scream that when it's to do with things that benefit them or stuff they did for themselves).

That the Labour Party will lose money and that it's politically motivated are both true and relevant. Additionally, Labour never touched party funding without cross-party support. Parties of government using their position to undermine their opposition is a clear abuse of power, whoever's doing it. If Labour had done so, people would rightly object to it.
 
&gt;But why shouldn't the Labour Party's funding come from schemes that are more in line with that of other parties?

This would be a perfectly good question if businesses asked their employees, customers and shareholders to 'opt-in' when they donate money to political parties. They don't. The current situation is in fact one where 'the Labour Party's funding come[s] from schemes that are more in line with that of other parties', except that the Labour Party's union funding is already subject to lots of restrictions imposed by the Tories, while businesses can fund whoever they want, to whatever amount they want, and never have to consult anybody. See how this is completely different from how the unions fund Labour?

&gt;In an ideal world there wouldn't be a union affiliated Labour Party

Benefit fraud accounts for 0.7% of claimants, of which roughly half is accounted for by forms wrongly filled in, so let's ~~put something in place to ensure the forms are correctly completed~~ treat all benefits claimants like fraudsters we just haven't caught yet.

&gt; ""Most tragically, in the last Parliament, the number of deaths associated with 'legal highs' has gone from one per month to over two per week,"" 

Interesting. Why? Have there been more ""legal highs"" hitting the streets since '10? Is there another reason why people are turning to dangerously untested psychoactive substances since the advent of the Coalition and austerity? How come they haven't taken the opportunity to blame it on the previous government this time? I don't believe for a second that anyone - thinktank spokesman or government source - hasn't picked their words with extreme care, so we can be certain that this is a problem that's emerged under Tory rule. If everyone is so happy with the way the country's gone since '10, why have the numbers of people using dangerously untested psychoactives gone through the roof?

I get that there's a huge debate about whether or not new highs should be illegal or not, but I'd like my questions answered first, quite frankly.

Happy with Ings ONLY if we get a top striker to go with him.

But Milner and Benteke I'd be hugely disappointed with. We have enough boring midfielders (not a knock on Milner, I just don't think he does anything Allen or Henderson don't do already) and we need a top striker, not an injury prone one who only plays well around transfer windows and new contracts. 

Overall? With that I'd be a bit underwhelmed as I think striker is the key, and if our main signing is 30mil on Benteke I'd be very disappointed (I'm not delusional, I know we can hardly attract the best in Europe but there are many better options than Benteke) I also think that list is severely lacking a centre back which is much needed, while Kovacic would be interesting, we're quite deep in those attacking midfield positions.

If they pay the wages he has with us then I doubt it'd be THAT high for a club like Sevilla, because we signed him in our first season back in the PL and wouldn't have exactly been dishing out 100k a week (though I seem to remember at least 30k and at most 60k being reported - I don't believe 60k so we'll see).  

The other thing is that while here he's been under 3 different managers, one of which had a play style Gaston just couldn't adapt to. It's a shame and I do always think he might have come good in time if Adkins had stayed, or he'd managed to stay injury free. I'd not be sad to lose him but I think it'd be a shame to let a player like him go when we need European depth - and he's a player that *could* do well against other European teams. He's been here for 3 years now though with little to no obvious progression, so maybe he wants to move on for the good of his career as much as we might want to get some money for him.  

Hull over Sevilla is odd because you'd have thought he might want to go to a different country, try to get back into form in a different league, but then again Hull looked like they might have a good season after last year - lots of investment, started out in the Euro's....

If you live near any of the train stations on the West Calder line in Edinburgh then there are trains every half hour which take less than 30 minutes, or if you're wanting to drive it'll be about 30-45 minutes each way depending on exactly where in town you want to live. You'll be going against the tide so to speak, as most people drive into Edinburgh to work, so traffic probably isn't going to be too bad.

Trust me though, if you're wanting a social life, and presumably dating, you'll be doing yourself a massive favour living in Edinburgh rather than West Lothian.

Train stations on the West Calder line out of Edinburgh are Waverley (expensive to live nearby) Haymarket (probably your best shout if you can find a decent place) Slateford (cheaper than Haymarket and can be nice or can be shite) Kingsknowe (nicer south of the station than north) and Wester Hailes (avoid). 

Having said all this, living in Edinburgh is not particularly cheap, so you need to decide if it's worth the extra commuting costs (either train or fuel) and higher cost of living. For me, it absolutely would be worth the extra cost, but that's your decision to make.

Behaviour?

&gt; The parasympathetic nervous system is one of the two divisions of the **autonomic nervous system**

&gt; The **autonomic nervous system** is a control system that acts **largely unconsciously** and regulates bodily functions such as the heart rate, digestion, respiratory rate, pupillary response, urination, and **sexual arousal**.

null,false,vzzzbux,null,null,null,"&gt; So people are desperate to opt-out but they won't do so because they have to - gasp - fill out a form? Where is this demand to have to opt-in coming from? Union members? No, it's coming from the government.

The point is that isn't trivial to opt out. If it was a tick box saying ""do you want to opt out of donating to the Labour Party"" on the application form there'd be less of an issue

&gt; So your logic here is, because some big unions have an optional additionall fee for Labour affiliation, no unions should have an opt-out for their political fund. I don't know if it's just me, but it seems like you're missing a few steps there.

The point was that the article attempts to distort the facts. What matters are the number of union members who are in Labour affiiliated unions.

&gt; That's not the argument. I have no problem with it being opt-in. Unions are democratic, member-run organisations. If they want it to be opt-in, it can be. What I have a problem with is the government forcing us to make it an opt-in. That's completely different.

There are laws covering party campaigning and donations. Why is it okay to have laws on how much control a corporation has on a party, but not okay for unions to do the same?

&gt; That the Labour Party will lose money and that it's politically motivated are both true and relevant. 

It's not really relevant though. If people want to donate to Labour, they'll opt in to do it, or they will donate directly and cut out the middleman. Moaning about loss of money makes Labour's argument sound petulant. They may have a point about it being politically motivated, but as is usual for Labour, there's an element of hypocrisy involved. It's okay when it benefits them or is done by them, but not the other way around.

&gt; This would be a perfectly good question if businesses asked their employees, customers and shareholders to 'opt-in' when they donate money to political parties.

Customers can choose to go elsewhere, shareholders can hold votes to dictate where the company donates if they so wish. Employees could possibly move to a different company if it offends them that much. Union members cannot easily move to an unaffiliated union.

&gt; The current situation is in fact one where 'the Labour Party's funding come[s] from schemes that are more in line with that of other parties',

Not really, though. 

&gt; except that the Labour Party's union funding is already subject to lots of restrictions imposed by the Tories, while businesses can fund whoever they want, to whatever amount they want, and never have to consult anybody. 

I don't think there is going to be a limit on what the unions can donate, though? Simply that what they donate will be contributed by people who have made a specific effort to agree to it, rather than assuming consent. Companies have shareholders who can vote on the same issue. I don't think most companies donate significant enough sums to have the sort of control that the likes of Unite have on Labour, though.

&gt; Um. Why?

Because a minority of the working population are in a union, and for the simple reason that a handful of organisations shouldn't have control of a major political party. If the CBI could dictate the Conservatives to the extent that the unions can control Labour, you would probably be screaming from the mountains about it.

The most notable case, of course, would be the red card in the first match against City, but I am quite certain there have been other, similar situations this year.  It may be down to his lack of speed just as much as it is his positioning, though - my memory for the events is not clear enough that I could say for certain.

I have to disagree with the assertion that being fast and good on the ball is the qualities of a fullback more than a centre back, especially at Spurs under Pochettino.  The manager wants the team to build attacks from the back, which makes it essential for the CBs to be able to handle the ball well.  Now, I'm not saying that Fazio doesn't (even if he has had a few howlers, like in the Chel53a match), but you list that as one of Dier's strenghts, saying it's an indication that his skills are more suited to a fullback position, while I think it's just as important in a CB when you play a modern kind of system.  Speed is equally important in a CB at Spurs, since Pochettino favours a high defensive line.

Wordpress.org is the site for the Wordpress software.  You can download the Wordpress software here to install on your own machine, or a host you're renting (or where other hosting companies can get the Wordpress software to install and offer to you).  It's roughly equivalent to [code.reddit.com](http://code.reddit.com) where you can download the code which runs reddit for your own use.

Wordpress.com provides actual hosted blogs (both free and paid) using the Wordpress software.  That's more like actual reddit.

Other than that I agree with /u/whencanIstop - blogs live or die on their content, not their platform.

use the PPP (purchasing power parity) adjusted GDP per capita rather than the GDP per capita at current prices:

France	36,725 USD	39,818 USD

Because the ROSCOs are private companies and are not as heavily regulated as the TOCs there has been some controversy over the prices charged to rent rolling stock when a route has been won by a company - there is an extremely limited supply of passenger rolling stock in the UK which of course has it's own market influences, but the fact that most of these ROSCOs are a semi-monopoly (they know what the TOCs need and what they and each other have available to lease) means that they have in the past allegedly inflated prices. They now all subscribe to a voluntary code of practice though which has limited this effect.

The freight companies tend not to lease as much as their passenger counterparts, but the smaller freight companies and those needing specialist equipment tend to lease, as well as demand-based leasing occurring.",null,0,null,1433151329,null,0,false,0,crrovd2,null,t3_37ulhg,null,t1_crrovd2,null,t3_37ulhg,null,null,null,1433512405,null,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3,null

&gt;  In 2010, the largest survey of its type in the world – the US Centre for Disease Control's National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey – found that the rates of men being forced to penetrate women over the previous year were identical to the rates of women reporting being raped: 1.1%. Lifetime prevalence of the crimes were 4.8% for men and 17.8% for women. Meanwhile, men reporting sex through coercion was 1.5% over the past year (6% lifetime) compared with 2% (13% lifetime) for women.

&gt;  A consensus emerged that not only do a significant minority of men report having been forced or coerced into a sexual act in their lifetime, even higher numbers of women admit to having forced or coerced a man to do so.

null,false,whencanistop,null,null,null,"I realise I didn't actually answer your question and another person may turn up to this looking for the same answer, so here it is (this is a simplified version for a layman!):

Most websites are a platform and a database.  The platform will look after the templates of the pages (what size and colour font you use, how many columns in the page, etc) whereas the database will look after the words and pictures within each of the pages.  Wordpress is a platform.  If you want to use wordpress, you can either use it where they have installed on their servers (wordpress.com) and they will provide you with a database.  Because it is on their servers, they limit what you can and can't do, including not allowing you to have your own custom domain (so your website address will be myblog.wordpress.com) and limiting what you can do in the admin interface.  This is free.  Because Wordpress is nice.

Alternatively, Wordpress will give you their platform for free in a big file that you can install anywhere.  You can install it on your hard drive of your computer (however the only person who will be able to see it is you).  Alternatively you can buy some space on a webserver somewhere.  It will cost you a couple of quid a month (I use TSOHost, but there are plenty out there).    They will probably also sell you a domain name at that point (costs up to £15 a year).

TSOHost, who I use, will automatically do an install of Wordpress onto your servers for you and many others do too.  It is simple.

1. If you decide to do this manually, the first thing you need to do when installing Wordpress is to create a database.  They make this sound easy, but it isn't.  Log in to your control panel of your hosting.  You can access the control panel by logging in on the website and then going to manage your account.  This will have an option for a MySQL database - use the wizard to create one if you need to.

2. Download and unzip the Wordpress platform from their website.  When you buy server space, they'll either give you an interface you can log into on your browser (it looks like your file manager!) that will allow you to install on Wordpress (and create a database for your content) or you'll have to use an FTP to access the server.  Don't panic! this is effectively just remotely looking at a file server (use a free tool like Filezilla) , enter the location of your files (it will be an IP address) and your username and password. Put it all in the root location of the server

3. Go to your website domain address and follow the instructions.

This is now your wordpress installation.  You'll be given a login id and a password and you'll be able to see the admin interface where you can create and edit your blog posts online.  Because wordpress is completely open source, you can change anything here you want (although be wary because changing some things will break everything and you won't be able to log in to the admin interface.  Wordpress is made up of:

1. Themes: These are generic templates that other people have created that allow you to create your website.  There will be a number of templates and you can use them how you will
2. Widgets: These are customisable little bits on the page that have been created by someone else that you can use based on their specifications (eg you could have a widget with a number of links to your favourite blog in it)
3. Plugins: Plugins are a bunch of things that third party developers have created that add additional features to your blog (eg one that will automatically add facebook like buttons to your page)
4. Pages: These are unique pages on your site for you to do things like About me - there will be a online editor for you to change these and publish them
5. Posts: These are your blog posts - as above with an editor allowing you to create, edit and publish
6. Comments: This is where users' comments appear and you can moderate them

On a complete side note, there is one other thing you should do when you start blogging and that is work out what the point of your blog is (your 'strategy').  This will help you work out what you should be writing about, who your audience is and what tone to use.  I reckon there are three broad categories:

1. Write about stuff you are interested in as a hobby (or about you for friends and family).  If you do this then you will be able to make some money through advertising, but it is unlikely to allow you to give up your day job, so have realistic expectations, especially at the start.  Assume it will cover costs if that.  You will have to make time to update the blog regularly otherwise people won't read it.  Use a conversational tone for these blogs and keep the posts limited to those subject areas
2. Highlight your skills: This is what I have done in the past.  The blog is effectively a big advert for me so that I can use it to help me get better jobs in the future by showcasing my talents (prospective employers will google you!).  Because this is already an advert, then you don't need further advertising and that might put some off.  With this your posts can afford to be a bit more infrequent, but I'd recommend them to be in greater depth
3. Making money: If your sole purpose is to make money, you should probably still start with a central theme, but you need to work out your business model: You can go populist and attempt to get display advertising through lots of impressions - this is hard work and probably won't make you a living so you'll need a proper job too.  You can attempt to sell through affiliate deals - again you'll need a niche and then you'll need to sign up to companies that do deals like this (physical objects you can do through Amazon or direct to companies, but there are lots of others).  You'll probably still need a day job if you do this.  Finally you can sell or resell stuff directly through your own shop (you can get a free Yahoo! shop if you need to) - if this is going to be your route and your blog is supporting it, then this can be your day job, but you'll need to know the products.

For reference, the things that use a lot of electricity are an electric cooker, a rapid-boil kettle. If you have gas, then again the cooker, the central heating, possibly switching on the shower if you have a combi boiler.

I would suggest writing down the numbers on all of the meters before you start switching things on, so that your numbers match the landlord's, and also so you can calculate the speed things are moving if it is not obvious just by looking.",null,0,null,1433152497,null,0,false,0,crrp432,null,t3_38268o,null,t1_crrp432,null,t3_38268o,null,null,null,1433512519,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

The lib dems weren't in fear of their safety. The Tories didn't park Agent 47 down their cul de sac, they didn't put a gun to their head. 

The Tories simply leveraged what the lib dems wanted, which was to hold onto some degree of ""power"" in any way possible. 

They didn't threaten the lib dems, they stuffed their mouths with gold.

If the lib dems had merely paid lip service to not raising tuition fees, fine. But they didn't. They made it a core plank of their election campaign. They took a significantly increased share of the student vote specifically for that issue. And then betrayed that vote.

Now, if you induce someone to rely on you, and then betray that trust to their detriment, that is hugely wrong.

Ultimately to what extent you hold the betrayer liable in comparison to the murderers is down the your personal morality and principles.

Wales needs devo-max at the very least with an independent tax, economic and legal regime - or full independence so we can act in our best interests. It's a zero sum game if we're in the union (£1 spent in Wales instead of London is a waste to the UK overall) but if England could invest its own money in London whilst Wales stimulatanously expanded our economy (through EU grants, ability to borrow/release govt bonds, have our own monetary policy) it stops being a zero sum game and both regions could benefit.

null,false,paddyduke,null,null,null,"&gt; Have you ever actually been on zero hours?

I have not. I'm fortunate enough to have a full time, salaried job in an industry that also gives me a lot of flexibility in how, where and when I work.

My partner has a ZHC, as do several of our friends. They all hate it. They mainly work in the service industry, though, so it could be that the more exploitative aspects are limited to some sectors.

&gt; I get asked every week when I'm available and I'll give them a list of days. Every day I'll get a text saying what I'm doing the following day. Sometimes something comes up and I need additional time off so I'll tell them I'm not available for the following day and take it off.

That's a luxury not afforded to a lot of ZHC workers. For example, my partner often finds out her shifts for the following week on a Thursday or Friday, but she does not usually get asked when she is available. Notice of any time off must be given at least a month in advance. She is also not allowed to work a second job, in case she is needed at very short notice.

Workers who are unable to work their assigned shifts may be punished (unofficially) by being given fewer hours in future. People have been quietly forced out of her workplace this way.

&gt; Yet as a truck driver I own two houses so it can't be that bad. Yes earnings are variable but when you've been doing it long enough you know when the busy and quiet periods are and you build up a buffer.

Truck driving is a skilled trade with a high demand for workers. A quick google shows that the average salary for a truck driver in the UK is around 10k higher than the UK median wage. What about relatively unskilled, minimum (or close to minimum) wage workers on ZHCs, like my partner? You seem to be doing well on a ZHC, which is great, but that doesn't mean it works for everyone. 

ZHCs are easily abused by unscrupulous employers. I don't necessarily want to see them banned, but I'd like there to be more controls in place to determine when and how they're used. A small majority of ZHC employees may be happy now, but they have very little security or bargaining power if things change for them in the future.",null,0,null,1433153585,null,0,false,0,crrpcd9,null,t3_37kiht,null,t1_crrpcd9,null,t1_crnrntv,null,null,null,1433512627,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Adds about 30 minutes to the journey time from what I've read.

What I don't understand about this, though, is if we are really worried about illegal immigrants (and we probably should be to a certain degree at least), then why not get these dealt with at the EU borders *hundreds of miles away from us*? A pan-EU immigration force operating in the Mediterranean, properly manned and funded land borders in the east and so on. The EU working collectively on this could be much more effective than individual countries going alone.

Still, a more or less non-stop service to the in-laws sounds quite handy...

null,false,AnxiousMo-Fo,,Labour | Check out /r/LabourUK!,null,"If you don't think their should even be a union-affiliated Labour Party, we're having the wrong argument. You're not 'In favour of opt-in', you're 'In favour of no chance whatsoever to opt-in'.

Unite doesn't 'control' Labour. That used to be the case in the days of union block voting, but that was abolished a long time ago. Unite's *members* control Labour. What's more, Unite's members can choose whether to control or fund Labour. I am a member of Unite, and they had to ring me up and ask me if I wanted to be registered as a 'Supporter' of Labour.

For the record, if I thought the CBI had direct control over the Conservatives, I would continue to do what I currently do, which is campaign against the Conservatives. As far as I'm concerned, welathy business owners already control the Tories. If they did so through the CBI, the process would actually be considerably more transparent, so in a way it'd be a good thing.

But I digress. That's not going to happen, it wouldn't be relevant if it did, and it remains the case that members of a union who choose to give money to Labour have enormously more say over whether their union does that, and how the Labour party spends the money, than does anyone associated with a business.

The double standard in your argument about business donations is astonishing: Your argument is, 'People associated with a business can vote against [which is only true of shareholders, not employees or customers] or leave the business if they don't like donations'. That is also true of union members, only union members also get a vote every 10 years on whether they want to coninue donations and can opt-out of donations while remaining in the union. So, union members have considerably more say over donations than do employees, customers or shareholders. Additionally, Labour doesn't just pocket union members' money and walk off with it: They also give all of them a vote in how the party is run.

If you're comparing union members' rights over their unions' donations with stakeholders in businesses rights over the same, union members win, every time.

By the way, I've changed jobs and I've changed unions. Changing unions is easier.

Again, though, this legislation doesn't only make it harder to fund Labour; it makes it harder to fund all political activities that trade unions take part in. It's not optional for members to give some of their fee to the hardship fund that all unions have; it's not optional for members to give some of their fee to the legal services that all unions provide. Why do you only think that political funds are problematic?

Regarding Labour being a 'major political party' -- Your argument is so crazy, I don't know where to start with it. Labour are a major political party because people vote for them in large numbers. If people had a problem with the unions, they'd not vote Labour. You don't get to decide what kind of party gets to be a major party. The voters do.

What I'm saying is, if we were independent, we could have a chance to host our own high tech, high income industries such as financial services, biotechnology, IT etc - basically the Ireland model of growth. 

Currently, it's all concentrated in London. Obviously, London &amp; Westmister would be unwilling to give it up (there's a huge debate about moving the BBC to Manchester) so sovereignty is our only chance really. London has critical mass in terms of skills, expertise and insane economies of agglomeration - we can never compete with that as long as we're under Westminster's thumb. 

However, it will be tough in the first 5 or so years (maybe 10) with no surplus tax coming from England. But in the long run it's worth it - we're a small, highly educated/skilled, agile nation where just a little bit of FDI will have a huge impact. We're not poor because we're somehow inferior.

We were an average West Belfast catholic family. Until my younger sister was Diagnosed with Cancer - she died aged 11 after nearly two years of struggling with the disease. This was just over 20 years ago.

Between the diagnosis and her eventual death, where we literally watched the life drain out of her, our home became a sort of religious twilight zone - holy pictures everywhere, we had to say multiple rosary's with other long repeated prayer sessions every night before bed, priests and nuns would call around unannounced (almost like our home was some kind of religious tourist attraction) every week. They flew her to Lourdes in the south of France, praying for a miracle. 

For a long time after her death, I wondered if my lack of faith was somehow a factor in how things worked out - I was still basically a kid - aged 14.

It crushed our family, took us years to regain any sort of normal family life - long after the rest of us kids had left home. 

My parents are still religious, though my family know i'm an athiest. We don't speak about religion these days.

I'm a bit confused as to what you are trying to say. Do you mean the standard for the 1st week compared to that of the 32nd week would take more than 32 weeks to achieve?

&gt;Training for marines selection should start well before someone goes on the training course.

They do have a minimum level of fitness to achieve before they are sent to basic training. Firstly a 2.4km run on a 2% incline in 12 minutes and 30 seconds and then the same distance/incline again immediately after in 10 minutes. After that they have to complete the [PRMC](http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/careers/royal-marines/how-to-join-the-marines/rm-potential-royal-marines-course#day-one).

&gt;That would be my guess too but a friend of mine has been going through the application process for the army and there are a lot of pre-entry medical checks etc.

The medicals aren't exactly thorough exams they mostly go by medical history for bigger issues, then go through the basics like listening to your heart, breathing etc.

If you have any remaining instincts that the British electorate feels favourably towards immigrants and that a more proportional system which reflected the wishes of the electorate would be progressive, you probably shouldn't look at the data. 

According to the 2014 British Social Attitudes Survey, 77% of people want to see immigration reduced, with 56% wanting to see it reduced ‘a lot’ and an additional 21% wanting to see it reduced ‘a little’. (British Social Attitudes Survey 2014, URL: http://www.natcen.ac.uk/our-research/research/british-social-attitudes/)

A January 2014 poll by YouGov for The Sunday Times found that 76% of respondents supported placing a ban on immigrants to Britain receiving any benefits until they had lived in Britain for at least two years, while 15% opposed the policy and 9% didn’t know.
The same poll found that 62% of respondents supported a ban on immigrants to Britain receiving any benefits until they had lived in the UK for at least five years. 26% opposed it and 13% didn’t know. The same poll asked whether respondents asked whether respondents supported David Cameron’s pledge to reduce net immigration into Britain from hundreds of thousands to the tens of thousands. 78% of respondents supported the policy, while 10% opposed it and 12% didn’t know. (YouGov for The Sunday Times, January 2014, URL: http://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/9zzdddu0no/YG-Archive-Pol-Sunday-Times-results-140110.pdf)

76% of respondents agreed that Ed Miliband is right to accept that the last Labour Government made major mistakes on immigration.(ComRes for The Independent on Sunday, August 2013, http://www.comres.co.uk/polls/SM_IoS_Political_Poll_August_2013.pdf, page 70.)

The government has a clear immigration policy of reducing net migration from the hundreds of thousands to the tens of thousands by the end of this Parliament. There is a high level of support for this policy, including from Liberal Democrat voters. 78% support the government’s aim to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands, including 70% of Lib Dems (YouGov for The Sunday Times, January 2012, URL: http://cdn.yougov.com/cumulus_uploads/document/d51j2t3jzl/YG-Archives-Pol-ST-results-06-080112.pdf)",null,0,null,1433155227,null,0,false,0,crrppkc,null,t3_382220,null,t1_crrppkc,null,t1_crrpjxl,null,null,null,1433512801,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

Nor do I. However who are we to decide what other people want? If people want to live in an overly punitive, socially regressive, economically uncompetitive dump then shouldn't we let them? Isn't that what democracy is about? The argument boils down to 'I don't trust politicians to do what is right in parliament' and then supplant that by saying that the right people for the job are ones who don't accurately represent the citizens of this country - what we have right now. Getting representation into parliament is a good thing for democracy, having governments formed on the basis of who can advertise best in marginal constituencies best is not (in my opinion).

&gt;Then the moderates would either have to get those extremist elements to sign off on what they want to do, or do a deal with the other moderates resulting in grand coalitions which end up pissing everyone off and strengthening the fringe elements.

For another example, the industry conducted a PR campaign asserting it was safer to be thrown out of a car in a crash than to be restrained by a seatbelt because they didn't want to spend the money on fitting them.

The idea that it ""represents local people"" is an illusion.

The current system means a region specific party will ultimately get the largest minority of votes there and unjustly force everyone else out (see SNP) while sensible nationwide parties with significant support but not concentrated in any particular area will be hugely unrepresented (see Lib Dems, UKIP, Greens).

Secondly, how do we measure who has had to make a sacrifice? We will have no idea.

On top of that, it's **still** a relative measure. Use my phone (landline even, not mobile) example, you could say a phone is non essential, but because they are ubiquitous among better off people, it has become essential. That's still a ""relative"" argument that I am making.

null,false,Ordinary650,null,null,null,"I think free University education had its place when people from disadvantaged backgrounds weren't attending university, regardless of the loan and grant schemes the government provided.

Ireland is the best example, free 3rd level education completely changed the entire country. Previous to that, people who couldn't afford it had government support available, but it just wasn't ""the done thing"".

However at this point, that barrier is gone, and the current UK fee system is actually relatively fair, higher earner pay back more, lower earners may never pay back.

However, I think this whole part of your post is a bad path for a society to go down:

&gt;Why is it that a poor family should pay, via their taxes, for the someone who has received private education to go to university? Why should families who can afford to send their children to university for full fees be subsidised by tax payers?

Why should families who can afford to send their children to private primary school be subsidised by taxpayers? Why should people who can afford private health insurance be subsidised by tax payers? 

It's a can of worms to use that argument - and ignores that the rich family would still be taxpayers.

The short answer to your core questions is that a more highly educated society means a society with the ability to make more money. Certain things in society are completely essential but not used by everyone to the same extent. Roads for example, I don't own a car or drive, but without roads then my life would still be hugely affected. Perhaps not everybody would attend free university, but all those people graduating and taking high paying jobs contributes more to the economy and tax pool in general.",null,0,null,1433123462,null,0,false,0,crrevsd,null,t3_37ydm8,null,t1_crrevsd,null,t3_37ydm8,null,null,null,1436623280,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

I think kit manufacturers and teams are being more precise about how they spend their money.  Smaller labels are picking up clubs with better exposure because of the amount of money mega clubs are demanding for the exposure that goes along with their success.

Teams like Barcelona, PSG, Chelsea, et. al. not only regularly go deep in UEFA competitions, they also sign a cadre of players from different markets, and preseason visit even more vastly different markets developing their global brand.

From my perspective, Nike and ADIDAS are forced to pay more for this growing exposure and thereby can't actually outbid the UAs, Warriors, etc of the world on 1b or 2nd 'tier' clubs.",null,0,null,1433123560,null,0,false,0,crrexkf,null,t3_37zqsz,null,t1_crrexkf,null,t1_crrcvpv,null,null,null,1436623310,null,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1,null

The first football match I can remember is the European Super Cup between Bayern and Dinamo Kiev in 1975 - the white-blues (бело-голубые) won!

I don't think FSG is intending to fire Rodgers unless they don't get the right answers from Rodgers or maybe perceive that Rodgers doesn't have the heart for the challenge of another campaign.

I am not quick to advocate the dismissal of Rodgers. It's funny when people think that they know more about tactics or the players more than Rodgers. I don't think Rodgers suddenly went from a promising young manager to a shit manager all of a sudden.

I think Rodgers deserves another full season to see how he can bounce back. And I hope that FSG gives him their 100% support to succeed as well. And then let's see what happens.

&gt;The __2015–16 UEFA Europa League__ will be the 45th season of [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe)'s secondary club [football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) tournament organised by [UEFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA), and the 7th season since it was renamed from the UEFA Cup to the [UEFA Europa League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League).

&gt;The [2016 UEFA Europa League Final](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_UEFA_Europa_League_Final) will be played at the [St. Jakob-Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Jakob-Park) in [Basel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel), Switzerland. 

&gt;[Sevilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sevilla_FC) are the two-time defending champions. As they automatically qualified for the [2015–16 UEFA Champions League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015%E2%80%9316_UEFA_Champions_League) group stage as the Europa League title holders, they will not be able to defend their title unless they finish third in the group stage.

null,false,trasofsunnyvale,lfc12,,null,"&gt; No doubt Pep is one of the best managers but he is inexperienced with lower budgets and poorer teams.

It's as if you stopped reading after ""inexperienced."" Obviously Pep is vastly experienced in football, and as you said, has accomplished some of the greatest things you can in football. But that doesn't mean he has any experience at a club where he can't just go out and buy virtually any player in the world to fit his system. If you think that Swansea or Newcastle aren't totally different jobs that require some totally different talents than Barca, then you're kidding yourself.

&gt;Then that's just showing a lack of ambition on the part of Liverpool's fans. It's sad. 

This is the classic catch-22 for all Liverpool supporters. If we are realistic about the fact that we can't compete with Chelsea and City using the same methods that they do (which are far easier), then we show no ambition. If we talk about competing for the title and consistent CL football, then we get called deluded and accused of living in the past (as you have yourself done). There is no way to win as Liverpool fans.

Unfortunately, football supporters who don't have their heads up their ass understand that wage bills directly correlate to league positions. [As the 6th highest wage bill in the EPL](http://www.tsmplug.com/football/premier-league-player-salaries-club-by-club/), while still losing a few million each year, or maybe breaking even, we cannot hope to challenge for the title consistently. When revenues get close to the top 3, then Liverpool should be competing. At the moment, though, the reality is that Liverpool is a top 6 club, not top 4, and we have expectations that come with one of the elite clubs in world football without the other tools needed to meet them.

Smith's isn't as flamboyant as Tennant's in that he doesn't wear his emotions on his sleeve. With Smith you have to really pay attention to how he says things, both in his wording and his delivery. There's a lot of meaning in the pauses he takes, and the way he'll answer difficult questions in a round about way. His face is also very expressive, and he can convey several emotions in a very quick amount of time. Smith is very good at subtly conveying drama. But don't think that makes him morose, those things that make him great for subtle drama are also great for comedy. His facial reactions to something a little uncomfortable or awkward are hilarious. And again more of the humor comes from what isn't said than what is said.

But when I first started watching football, one of the first matches I watched was the 1-0 win over Manchester United in 2006. That caught my interest, and so I started to learn more about the club. The history, the titles, the successes (such as 1967), and the struggles. I quickly fell in love. My great-grandmother was a Scottish immigrant to Canada, my great-grandfather an Irish immigrant to the United States, I grew up in a Catholic family. There was so much about this club that seemed to reflect my own identity.

As I learned more about this club, I also learned more about Rangers. I'm a bit of a fanatic when it comes to sports, so I bought into the rivalry right quick. And seeing the dirty style of play they employed on the field at times intensified that dislike for Rangers... and watching them win 3 straight SPL titles began to turn that into absolute hatred for me. I honestly hate Rangers, and I too wish that organization a quick death...

...unless it hurts the club I have come to love so much. And while I was originally celebrating the terrible situation at Ibrox, these last few years have left a sour taste in my mouth. Players seem to be leaving more and it seems harder to get top players in, and I think that boils down to 2 things: an apparent lack of a challenge (I think I could manage Celtic to a Premiership title without Rangers in the league) leaves players with no motivation to stay/come, and a probable loss of revenue due to the absence of Rangers (in terms of marketing and advertising contracts, etc...

null,false,MyreMyalar,null,null,null,"No they won't because you have a 'potential migrant pool' with a declining fertility rate and a native population, also with a declining fertility rate. Years of 'uncontrolled' immigration have given us a good sample at the kind of rates that people from elsewhere in the EU come to the UK and it's pretty easy to project those rates forward and by the time we've imported enough young people to push the fertility rate upward the potential pool's fertility rate has also declined to the point where new young people no longer have a boosting effect. In other words the process has diminishing returns but it's good for the UK that we've managed to (and will continue to) ring some benefits out of it, Japan took the opposite path and had very low immigration and now their demographic timebomb will be much larger and harder to deal with.

with housing you have supply and demand yes, but given that immigration (i.e. demand) brings economic benefits in the short and medium terms it seems far more sensible to increase supply than to try and hurt our country by slashing demand. It's like looking at a group of starving people and saying 'well we could feed them... or we could have them all killed. Both would solve the problem, so a mix of the two would be even more effective! Lets kill half and feed the rest'. Sometimes splitting the difference and picking the 'middle' path isn't wisdom.

We already do control immigration. The EU itself functions as an immigration control system. Only people that get into the club are allowed to freely move within it, right now it takes a very long time for new countries to join and they are added in ones and twos so the medium term impact can be assessed. We can look back and see what has happened and it turns out that all 503 million people in the EU don't flock to the UK. It turns out that the vast majority of people like to stay in their own countries and those that do migrate have a range of different options. Some like to catch the sun and migrate south (old people in the UK), some like to get good jobs and migrate north (Germany, Scandinavia, UK, France). Countries in the EU tend to see a boost to their economies over time and often economic immigrants will start to go back the other way.

In simple terms, you sign up to a bookmakers, place a bet in order to qualify for their free bet ""outcome A"", then you sign up to a betting exchange and ""lay"" the same bet - effectively betting that outcome A won't happen.

So no matter what, you'll ""win"" at either the bookmakers or the exchange, with only a loss of a few pence due to slight difference in odds.

Now comes the free bet, and you do exactly the same, except now the bet isn't your own money, so when it settles, you've made a guaranteed profit.  Repeat over 30-40 bookmakers. 

Then you have the option of multiple accounts, but there's other offers those same bookmakers will make to keep you as a ""punter"" which you can also take advantage of.  Its not gambling since you bet of both outcomes.  Gambling is a mugs game.

null,false,AnxiousMo-Fo,,Labour | Check out /r/LabourUK!,null,"So people are desperate to opt-out but they won't do so because they have to - gasp - *fill out a form?* Where is this demand to have to opt-in coming from? Union members? No, it's coming from the government.

&gt;But some unions make it all or nothing. Want non partisan campaigning? Tough, the political fund is there for the Labour Party. Want to move unions to one that doesn't support Labour? Tough, as your employer only recognises us

I've already pointed out that there are a number of ways you could avoid paying money to the Labour Party and still belong to whatever union you want. The Tories are doing this to make both the Labour Party and union campaigning ineffective. That is unfair given that they're still happy for any other kind of group to campaign.

&gt; Unite? ""Numbers of unions"" is simply playing with statistics - it's how much money and how many members that covers, that really matters

So your logic here is, because some big unions have an optional additionall fee for Labour affiliation, no unions should have an opt-out for their political fund. I don't know if it's just me, but it seems like you're missing a few steps there.

&gt;They should probably ask for their money back, given the NHS privatisations Labour pushed through

How is this relevant to the argument? If anything, this is an argument for *more* union influence on Labour policy.

&gt;A huge issue with the argument is that no one has made a case for why it shouldn't be opt in.

That's *not* the argument. I have no problem with it being opt-in. Unions are democratic, member-run organisations. If they want it to be opt-in, it can be. What I have a problem with is the government *forcing* us to make it an opt-in. That's completely different.

&gt;There's just cries of how the Labour Party will lose money, or how it is politically motivated (interesting how Labour doesn't scream that when it's to do with things that benefit them or stuff they did for themselves).

That the Labour Party will lose money and that it's politically motivated are both true and relevant. Additionally, Labour never touched party funding without cross-party support. Parties of government using their position to undermine their opposition is a clear abuse of power, whoever's doing it. If Labour had done so, people would rightly object to it.
 
&gt;But why shouldn't the Labour Party's funding come from schemes that are more in line with that of other parties?

This would be a perfectly good question if businesses asked their employees, customers and shareholders to 'opt-in' when they donate money to political parties. They don't. The current situation is in fact one where 'the Labour Party's funding come[s] from schemes that are more in line with that of other parties', except that the Labour Party's union funding is already subject to lots of restrictions imposed by the Tories, while businesses can fund whoever they want, to whatever amount they want, and never have to consult anybody. See how this is completely different from how the unions fund Labour?

&gt;In an ideal world there wouldn't be a union affiliated Labour Party

Benefit fraud accounts for 0.7% of claimants, of which roughly half is accounted for by forms wrongly filled in, so let's ~~put something in place to ensure the forms are correctly completed~~ treat all benefits claimants like fraudsters we just haven't caught yet.

&gt; ""Most tragically, in the last Parliament, the number of deaths associated with 'legal highs' has gone from one per month to over two per week,"" 

Interesting. Why? Have there been more ""legal highs"" hitting the streets since '10? Is there another reason why people are turning to dangerously untested psychoactive substances since the advent of the Coalition and austerity? How come they haven't taken the opportunity to blame it on the previous government this time? I don't believe for a second that anyone - thinktank spokesman or government source - hasn't picked their words with extreme care, so we can be certain that this is a problem that's emerged under Tory rule. If everyone is so happy with the way the country's gone since '10, why have the numbers of people using dangerously untested psychoactives gone through the roof?

Happy with Ings ONLY if we get a top striker to go with him.

But Milner and Benteke I'd be hugely disappointed with. We have enough boring midfielders (not a knock on Milner, I just don't think he does anything Allen or Henderson don't do already) and we need a top striker, not an injury prone one who only plays well around transfer windows and new contracts. 

Overall? With that I'd be a bit underwhelmed as I think striker is the key, and if our main signing is 30mil on Benteke I'd be very disappointed (I'm not delusional, I know we can hardly attract the best in Europe but there are many better options than Benteke) I also think that list is severely lacking a centre back which is much needed, while Kovacic would be interesting, we're quite deep in those attacking midfield positions.

If they pay the wages he has with us then I doubt it'd be THAT high for a club like Sevilla, because we signed him in our first season back in the PL and wouldn't have exactly been dishing out 100k a week (though I seem to remember at least 30k and at most 60k being reported - I don't believe 60k so we'll see).  

The other thing is that while here he's been under 3 different managers, one of which had a play style Gaston just couldn't adapt to. It's a shame and I do always think he might have come good in time if Adkins had stayed, or he'd managed to stay injury free.

Hull over Sevilla is odd because you'd have thought he might want to go to a different country, try to get back into form in a different league, but then again Hull looked like they might have a good season after last year - lots of investment, started out in the Euro's....

null,false,CD17,null,null,null,"I'd agree with living in the west of Edinburgh. I lived in Livingston for a year when I was 20-21 and it was nowhere near as good as living in Edinburgh proper. If you live near any of the train stations on the West Calder line in Edinburgh then there are trains every half hour which take less than 30 minutes, or if you're wanting to drive it'll be about 30-45 minutes each way depending on exactly where in town you want to live. You'll be going against the tide so to speak, as most people drive into Edinburgh to work, so traffic probably isn't going to be too bad.

Trust me though, if you're wanting a social life, and presumably dating, you'll be doing yourself a massive favour living in Edinburgh rather than West Lothian.

Train stations on the West Calder line out of Edinburgh are Waverley (expensive to live nearby) Haymarket (probably your best shout if you can find a decent place) Slateford (cheaper than Haymarket and can be nice or can be shite) Kingsknowe (nicer south of the station than north) and Wester Hailes (avoid). 

Having said all this, living in Edinburgh is not particularly cheap, so you need to decide if it's worth the extra commuting costs (either train or fuel) and higher cost of living. For me, it absolutely would be worth the extra cost, but that's your decision to make. If you do choose to move to Edinburgh take a wee look at [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Edinburgh/comments/2q4f03/how_to_find_a_property_to_rent_in_edinburgh_read/) for some advice, and in any situation, [this map](http://casa.oobrien.com/booth/) will give you a rough idea of how nice/shite an area is.

Items you ship to other EU countries may be charged at 0% VAT, but may still have to be declared on your VAT return. It might also depend on the nature of what you sell - I really have no experience in this area as my business is service based.

2) I'm almost certain that the current VAT threshold that applies: £82k. Make sure you understand when this kicks in - I believe you may have to register for VAT if it simply looks like your business is going to achieve this level.

requests are approved, the number of individuals affected and the type of crime
Communications Data is used for. 

&gt; ...

&gt; Currently, if the public want to know about how their communications can be accessed by
law enforcement, their only source of information is from the transparency reports
published by a handful of technology companies. It is unacceptable that law enforcement
agencies that access and use our personal data are so lacking in transparency and are so
reluctant to express the purpose and process of this element of policing. 

&gt; ...

&gt; A statistical analysis of how often these powers are requested, how often they are refused
and how effective they are when used, would assist in increasing public understanding of
why Communications Data plays a crucial role in 21st century policing.

The point is that isn't trivial to opt out. If it was a tick box saying ""do you want to opt out of donating to the Labour Party"" on the application form there'd be less of an issue

&gt; So your logic here is, because some big unions have an optional additionall fee for Labour affiliation, no unions should have an opt-out for their political fund. I don't know if it's just me, but it seems like you're missing a few steps there.

The point was that the article attempts to distort the facts. What matters are the number of union members who are in Labour affiiliated unions.

&gt; That's not the argument. I have no problem with it being opt-in. Unions are democratic, member-run organisations. If they want it to be opt-in, it can be. What I have a problem with is the government forcing us to make it an opt-in. That's completely different.

There are laws covering party campaigning and donations. Why is it okay to have laws on how much control a corporation has on a party, but not okay for unions to do the same?

&gt; That the Labour Party will lose money and that it's politically motivated are both true and relevant. 

It's not really relevant though. If people want to donate to Labour, they'll opt in to do it, or they will donate directly and cut out the middleman. Moaning about loss of money makes Labour's argument sound petulant. They may have a point about it being politically motivated, but as is usual for Labour, there's an element of hypocrisy involved. It's okay when it benefits them or is done by them, but not the other way around.

&gt; This would be a perfectly good question if businesses asked their employees, customers and shareholders to 'opt-in' when they donate money to political parties.

Customers can choose to go elsewhere, shareholders can hold votes to dictate where the company donates if they so wish. Employees could possibly move to a different company if it offends them that much. Union members cannot easily move to an unaffiliated union.

&gt; The current situation is in fact one where 'the Labour Party's funding come[s] from schemes that are more in line with that of other parties',

Not really, though. 

&gt; except that the Labour Party's union funding is already subject to lots of restrictions imposed by the Tories, while businesses can fund whoever they want, to whatever amount they want, and never have to consult anybody. 

I don't think there is going to be a limit on what the unions can donate, though? Simply that what they donate will be contributed by people who have made a specific effort to agree to it, rather than assuming consent. Companies have shareholders who can vote on the same issue. I don't think most companies donate significant enough sums to have the sort of control that the likes of Unite have on Labour, though.

&gt; Um. Why?

Because a minority of the working population are in a union, and for the simple reason that a handful of organisations shouldn't have control of a major political party. If the CBI could dictate the Conservatives to the extent that the unions can control Labour, you would probably be screaming from the mountains about it.

null,false,apathosaurus,null,null,null,"I may be suffering from a case of availability heruistic here - it's easier to remember a big mistake with grave consequences than it is to remember good positioning, which is relatively unremarkable since the consequence, for the most part, is that something does *not* happen -, but I distinctly recall Fazio being caught completely out of place several times during the past season.  The most notable case, of course, would be the red card in the first match against City, but I am quite certain there have been other, similar situations this year.  It may be down to his lack of speed just as much as it is his positioning, though - my memory for the events is not clear enough that I could say for certain.

I have to disagree with the assertion that being fast and good on the ball is the qualities of a fullback more than a centre back, especially at Spurs under Pochettino.  The manager wants the team to build attacks from the back, which makes it essential for the CBs to be able to handle the ball well.  Now, I'm not saying that Fazio doesn't (even if he has had a few howlers, like in the Chel53a match), but you list that as one of Dier's strenghts, saying it's an indication that his skills are more suited to a fullback position, while I think it's just as important in a CB when you play a modern kind of system.  Speed is equally important in a CB at Spurs, since Pochettino favours a high defensive line.

Is it your opinion that Dier is better suited to play fullback than centre back?",null,0,null,1433149992,null,0,false,0,crrol3t,null,t3_37y2ee,null,t1_crrol3t,null,t1_crr6tfv,null,null,null,1437577585,null,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2,null

Wordpress.com provides actual hosted blogs (both free and paid) using the Wordpress software.  That's more like actual reddit.

We are also worse off than most of our competitors;

use the PPP (purchasing power parity) adjusted GDP per capita rather than the GDP per capita at current prices:

Country	2007	2013

UK	36,233 USD	38,224 USD

France	36,725 USD	39,818 USD

USA	47,954 USD	52,939 USD

New Zealand	30,793 USD	34,061 USD

Canada	38,999 USD	43,590 USD

Germany	38,751 USD	44,697 USD

Almost none of the Train Operating Companies (TOCs) in the UK own their own trains - most rent them from rolling stock operating companies (ROSCOs) - the ""Big Three"" are Angel Trains, Porterbrook, and Eversholt Rail Group (formerly HSBC Rail)

But in the Passenger sphere, almost all trains are owned by one of these ROSCOs who are responsible for doing varying amounts of maintenance on them (depending on the leasing terms) and who lease them out to the TOCs.

Because the ROSCOs are private companies and are not as heavily regulated as the TOCs there has been some controversy over the prices charged to rent rolling stock when a route has been won by a company - there is an extremely limited supply of passenger rolling stock in the UK which of course has it's own market influences, but the fact that most of these ROSCOs are a semi-monopoly (they know what the TOCs need and what they and each other have available to lease) means that they have in the past allegedly inflated prices. They now all subscribe to a voluntary code of practice though which has limited this effect.

&gt;  In 2010, the largest survey of its type in the world – the US Centre for Disease Control's National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey – found that the rates of men being forced to penetrate women over the previous year were identical to the rates of women reporting being raped: 1.1%. Lifetime prevalence of the crimes were 4.8% for men and 17.8% for women. Meanwhile, men reporting sex through coercion was 1.5% over the past year (6% lifetime) compared with 2% (13% lifetime) for women.

&gt;  A consensus emerged that not only do a significant minority of men report having been forced or coerced into a sexual act in their lifetime, even higher numbers of women admit to having forced or coerced a man to do so. Our collective ignorance of these issues does not arise from lack of data, but from a wilfully constructed wall of secrecy.",null,0,null,1433151602,null,0,1433160611,0,crroxev,null,t3_381y79,null,t1_crroxev,null,t3_381y79,null,null,null,1437577570,null,-17,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-17,null

null,false,whencanistop,null,null,null,"I realise I didn't actually answer your question and another person may turn up to this looking for the same answer, so here it is (this is a simplified version for a layman!):

Most websites are a platform and a database.  The platform will look after the templates of the pages (what size and colour font you use, how many columns in the page, etc) whereas the database will look after the words and pictures within each of the pages.  Wordpress is a platform.  If you want to use wordpress, you can either use it where they have installed on their servers (wordpress.com) and they will provide you with a database.  Because it is on their servers, they limit what you can and can't do, including not allowing you to have your own custom domain (so your website address will be myblog.wordpress.com) and limiting what you can do in the admin interface.  This is free.  Because Wordpress is nice.

Alternatively, Wordpress will give you their platform for free in a big file that you can install anywhere.  You can install it on your hard drive of your computer (however the only person who will be able to see it is you).  Alternatively you can buy some space on a webserver somewhere.  It will cost you a couple of quid a month (I use TSOHost, but there are plenty out there).    They will probably also sell you a domain name at that point (costs up to £15 a year).

TSOHost, who I use, will automatically do an install of Wordpress onto your servers for you and many others do too.  It is simple.

1. If you decide to do this manually, the first thing you need to do when installing Wordpress is to create a database.  They make this sound easy, but it isn't.  Log in to your control panel of your hosting.  You can access the control panel by logging in on the website and then going to manage your account.  This will have an option for a MySQL database - use the wizard to create one if you need to.

2. Download and unzip the Wordpress platform from their website.  When you buy server space, they'll either give you an interface you can log into on your browser (it looks like your file manager!) that will allow you to install on Wordpress (and create a database for your content) or you'll have to use an FTP to access the server.  Don't panic! this is effectively just remotely looking at a file server (use a free tool like Filezilla) , enter the location of your files (it will be an IP address) and your username and password. Put it all in the root location of the server

3. Go to your website domain address and follow the instructions.

This is now your wordpress installation.  You'll be given a login id and a password and you'll be able to see the admin interface where you can create and edit your blog posts online.  Because wordpress is completely open source, you can change anything here you want (although be wary because changing some things will break everything and you won't be able to log in to the admin interface.  Wordpress is made up of:

1. Themes: These are generic templates that other people have created that allow you to create your website.  There will be a number of templates and you can use them how you will
2. Widgets: These are customisable little bits on the page that have been created by someone else that you can use based on their specifications (eg you could have a widget with a number of links to your favourite blog in it)
3. Plugins: Plugins are a bunch of things that third party developers have created that add additional features to your blog (eg one that will automatically add facebook like buttons to your page)
4. Pages: These are unique pages on your site for you to do things like About me - there will be a online editor for you to change these and publish them
5. Posts: These are your blog posts - as above with an editor allowing you to create, edit and publish
6. Comments: This is where users' comments appear and you can moderate them

On a complete side note, there is one other thing you should do when you start blogging and that is work out what the point of your blog is (your 'strategy').  This will help you work out what you should be writing about, who your audience is and what tone to use.  I reckon there are three broad categories:

1. Write about stuff you are interested in as a hobby (or about you for friends and family).  If you do this then you will be able to make some money through advertising, but it is unlikely to allow you to give up your day job, so have realistic expectations, especially at the start.  Assume it will cover costs if that.  You will have to make time to update the blog regularly otherwise people won't read it.  Use a conversational tone for these blogs and keep the posts limited to those subject areas
2. Highlight your skills: This is what I have done in the past.  The blog is effectively a big advert for me so that I can use it to help me get better jobs in the future by showcasing my talents (prospective employers will google you!).  Because this is already an advert, then you don't need further advertising and that might put some off.  With this your posts can afford to be a bit more infrequent, but I'd recommend them to be in greater depth
3. Making money: If your sole purpose is to make money, you should probably still start with a central theme, but you need to work out your business model: You can go populist and attempt to get display advertising through lots of impressions - this is hard work and probably won't make you a living so you'll need a proper job too.  You can attempt to sell through affiliate deals - again you'll need a niche and then you'll need to sign up to companies that do deals like this (physical objects you can do through Amazon or direct to companies, but there are lots of others).  You'll probably still need a day job if you do this.  Finally you can sell or resell stuff directly through your own shop (you can get a free Yahoo! shop if you need to) - if this is going to be your route and your blog is supporting it, then this can be your day job, but you'll need to know the products.

The lib dems weren't in fear of their safety. The Tories didn't park Agent 47 down their cul de sac, they didn't put a gun to their head. 

The Tories simply leveraged what the lib dems wanted, which was to hold onto some degree of ""power"" in any way possible. 

They didn't threaten the lib dems, they stuffed their mouths with gold.

If the lib dems had merely paid lip service to not raising tuition fees, fine. But they didn't. They made it a core plank of their election campaign. They took a significantly increased share of the student vote specifically for that issue. And then betrayed that vote.

Now, if you induce someone to rely on you, and then betray that trust to their detriment, that is hugely wrong.

Ultimately to what extent you hold the betrayer liable in comparison to the murderers is down the your personal morality and principles.

I have not. I'm fortunate enough to have a full time, salaried job in an industry that also gives me a lot of flexibility in how, where and when I work.

My partner has a ZHC, as do several of our friends. They all hate it. They mainly work in the service industry, though, so it could be that the more exploitative aspects are limited to some sectors.

&gt; I get asked every week when I'm available and I'll give them a list of days. Every day I'll get a text saying what I'm doing the following day. Sometimes something comes up and I need additional time off so I'll tell them I'm not available for the following day and take it off.

That's a luxury not afforded to a lot of ZHC workers. For example, my partner often finds out her shifts for the following week on a Thursday or Friday, but she does not usually get asked when she is available. Notice of any time off must be given at least a month in advance. She is also not allowed to work a second job, in case she is needed at very short notice.

Workers who are unable to work their assigned shifts may be punished (unofficially) by being given fewer hours in future. People have been quietly forced out of her workplace this way.

&gt; Yet as a truck driver I own two houses so it can't be that bad. Yes earnings are variable but when you've been doing it long enough you know when the busy and quiet periods are and you build up a buffer.

Truck driving is a skilled trade with a high demand for workers. A quick google shows that the average salary for a truck driver in the UK is around 10k higher than the UK median wage. What about relatively unskilled, minimum (or close to minimum) wage workers on ZHCs, like my partner? You seem to be doing well on a ZHC, which is great, but that doesn't mean it works for everyone. 

ZHCs are easily abused by unscrupulous employers. I don't necessarily want to see them banned, but I'd like there to be more controls in place to determine when and how they're used. A small majority of ZHC employees may be happy now, but they have very little security or bargaining power if things change for them in the future.",null,0,null,1433153585,null,0,false,0,crrpcd9,null,t3_37kiht,null,t1_crrpcd9,null,t1_crnrntv,null,null,null,1436631381,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Adds about 30 minutes to the journey time from what I've read.

What I don't understand about this, though, is if we are really worried about illegal immigrants (and we probably should be to a certain degree at least), then why not get these dealt with at the EU borders *hundreds of miles away from us*? A pan-EU immigration force operating in the Mediterranean, properly manned and funded land borders in the east and so on. The EU working collectively on this could be much more effective than individual countries going alone.

Still, a more or less non-stop service to the in-laws sounds quite handy...

null,false,AnxiousMo-Fo,,Labour | Check out /r/LabourUK!,null,"If you don't think their should even be a union-affiliated Labour Party, we're having the wrong argument. You're not 'In favour of opt-in', you're 'In favour of no chance whatsoever to opt-in'.

Unite doesn't 'control' Labour. That used to be the case in the days of union block voting, but that was abolished a long time ago. Unite's *members* control Labour. What's more, Unite's members can choose whether to control or fund Labour. I am a member of Unite, and they had to ring me up and ask me if I wanted to be registered as a 'Supporter' of Labour.

For the record, if I thought the CBI had direct control over the Conservatives, I would continue to do what I currently do, which is campaign against the Conservatives. As far as I'm concerned, welathy business owners already control the Tories. If they did so through the CBI, the process would actually be considerably more transparent, so in a way it'd be a good thing.

But I digress. That's not going to happen, it wouldn't be relevant if it did, and it remains the case that members of a union who choose to give money to Labour have enormously more say over whether their union does that, and how the Labour party spends the money, than does anyone associated with a business.

The double standard in your argument about business donations is astonishing: Your argument is, 'People associated with a business can vote against [which is only true of shareholders, not employees or customers] or leave the business if they don't like donations'. That is also true of union members, only union members also get a vote every 10 years on whether they want to coninue donations and can opt-out of donations while remaining in the union. So, union members have considerably more say over donations than do employees, customers or shareholders. Additionally, Labour doesn't just pocket union members' money and walk off with it: They also give all of them a vote in how the party is run.

If you're comparing union members' rights over their unions' donations with stakeholders in businesses rights over the same, union members win, every time.

By the way, I've changed jobs and I've changed unions. Changing unions is easier.

Again, though, this legislation doesn't only make it harder to fund Labour; it makes it harder to fund all political activities that trade unions take part in. It's not optional for members to give some of their fee to the hardship fund that all unions have; it's not optional for members to give some of their fee to the legal services that all unions provide. Why do you only think that political funds are problematic?

Regarding Labour being a 'major political party' -- Your argument is so crazy, I don't know where to start with it. Labour are a major political party because people vote for them in large numbers. If people had a problem with the unions, they'd not vote Labour. You don't get to decide what kind of party gets to be a major party. The voters do.

What I'm saying is, if we were independent, we could have a chance to host our own high tech, high income industries such as financial services, biotechnology, IT etc - basically the Ireland model of growth. 

Currently, it's all concentrated in London. Obviously, London &amp; Westmister would be unwilling to give it up (there's a huge debate about moving the BBC to Manchester) so sovereignty is our only chance really. London has critical mass in terms of skills, expertise and insane economies of agglomeration - we can never compete with that as long as we're under Westminster's thumb. 

However, it will be tough in the first 5 or so years (maybe 10) with no surplus tax coming from England. But in the long run it's worth it - we're a small, highly educated/skilled, agile nation where just a little bit of FDI will have a huge impact. We're not poor because we're somehow inferior.

We were an average West Belfast catholic family. Until my younger sister was Diagnosed with Cancer - she died aged 11 after nearly two years of struggling with the disease. This was just over 20 years ago.

Between the diagnosis and her eventual death, where we literally watched the life drain out of her, our home became a sort of religious twilight zone - holy pictures everywhere, we had to say multiple rosary's with other long repeated prayer sessions every night before bed, priests and nuns would call around unannounced (almost like our home was some kind of religious tourist attraction) every week. They flew her to Lourdes in the south of France, praying for a miracle. 

For a long time after her death, I wondered if my lack of faith was somehow a factor in how things worked out - I was still basically a kid - aged 14.

It crushed our family, took us years to regain any sort of normal family life - long after the rest of us kids had left home.

I'm a bit confused as to what you are trying to say. Do you mean the standard for the 1st week compared to that of the 32nd week would take more than 32 weeks to achieve?

&gt;Training for marines selection should start well before someone goes on the training course.

They do have a minimum level of fitness to achieve before they are sent to basic training. Firstly a 2.4km run on a 2% incline in 12 minutes and 30 seconds and then the same distance/incline again immediately after in 10 minutes. After that they have to complete the [PRMC](http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/careers/royal-marines/how-to-join-the-marines/rm-potential-royal-marines-course#day-one).

&gt;That would be my guess too but a friend of mine has been going through the application process for the army and there are a lot of pre-entry medical checks etc.

The medicals aren't exactly thorough exams they mostly go by medical history for bigger issues, then go through the basics like listening to your heart, breathing etc.

Yeah, my niece was stuck in a block of flats like that for a while.  There was a dealer of drugs or dodgy ciggies or a grow on every floor puddles of piss and vomit in the stair wells and the occasional blood stain.  The place was well known to the police who'd turn up every couple of months and bust the usual suspects.  No one every admitted as much but it was obvious that the blocks were being used by the local authority to house the trouble makers and emergency homeless who'd be moving on in a few months.  Not a good place to be in and thank fuck she got out of there as soon as she could.

If you have any remaining instincts that the British electorate feels favourably towards immigrants and that a more proportional system which reflected the wishes of the electorate would be progressive, you probably shouldn't look at the data. 

According to the 2014 British Social Attitudes Survey, 77% of people want to see immigration reduced, with 56% wanting to see it reduced ‘a lot’ and an additional 21% wanting to see it reduced ‘a little’. (British Social Attitudes Survey 2014, URL: http://www.natcen.ac.uk/our-research/research/british-social-attitudes/)

A January 2014 poll by YouGov for The Sunday Times found that 76% of respondents supported placing a ban on immigrants to Britain receiving any benefits until they had lived in Britain for at least two years, while 15% opposed the policy and 9% didn’t know.
The same poll found that 62% of respondents supported a ban on immigrants to Britain receiving any benefits until they had lived in the UK for at least five years. 26% opposed it and 13% didn’t know. The same poll asked whether respondents asked whether respondents supported David Cameron’s pledge to reduce net immigration into Britain from hundreds of thousands to the tens of thousands. 78% of respondents supported the policy, while 10% opposed it and 12% didn’t know. (YouGov for The Sunday Times, January 2014, URL: http://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/9zzdddu0no/YG-Archive-Pol-Sunday-Times-results-140110.pdf)

76% of respondents agreed that Ed Miliband is right to accept that the last Labour Government made major mistakes on immigration.(ComRes for The Independent on Sunday, August 2013, http://www.comres.co.uk/polls/SM_IoS_Political_Poll_August_2013.pdf, page 70.)

The government has a clear immigration policy of reducing net migration from the hundreds of thousands to the tens of thousands by the end of this Parliament. There is a high level of support for this policy, including from Liberal Democrat voters. 78% support the government’s aim to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands, including 70% of Lib Dems (YouGov for The Sunday Times, January 2012, URL: http://cdn.yougov.com/cumulus_uploads/document/d51j2t3jzl/YG-Archives-Pol-ST-results-06-080112.pdf)",null,0,null,1433155227,null,0,false,0,crrppkc,null,t3_382220,null,t1_crrppkc,null,t1_crrpjxl,null,null,null,1436631623,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

Nor do I. However who are we to decide what other people want? If people want to live in an overly punitive, socially regressive, economically uncompetitive dump then shouldn't we let them? Isn't that what democracy is about? The argument boils down to 'I don't trust politicians to do what is right in parliament' and then supplant that by saying that the right people for the job are ones who don't accurately represent the citizens of this country - what we have right now. Getting representation into parliament is a good thing for democracy, having governments formed on the basis of who can advertise best in marginal constituencies best is not (in my opinion).

&gt;Then the moderates would either have to get those extremist elements to sign off on what they want to do, or do a deal with the other moderates resulting in grand coalitions which end up pissing everyone off and strengthening the fringe elements.
