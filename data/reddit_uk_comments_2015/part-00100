________________________
The allocation for the Welsh language within the wider Education &amp; Skills budget (including spending on Welsh in schools): [**£24.38m**](http://gov.wales/docs/caecd/publications/131206explanatoryen.pdf) (3% cut on the last financial year).
________________________
Total identifiable expenditure on the Welsh language in the financial year 2014-15 by the Welsh Government: **£28.07m**, or **0.18%** of the Welsh Government's budget.
_________________________
Figures on road signs and government literature are harder to come by, because there is no specific budget set for such things: the government has a commitment to bilingualism and as such those costs will be spread across all government departments. Regardless, it's a proverbial drop in the ocean. Road signs do not require huge capital investments in the first place, and will only require replacing infrequently. Train announcements are the province of Network Rail and Arriva Trains Wales, not the government.

You're getting angry over peanuts. In 2008, we subsidised the financial elites to the tune of **£500 billion** (**17812.6113** times the Welsh Government's expenditure on the Welsh Language this year), and we didn't stop there. If you want to get angry about something, get angry about that.

EDIT: Actually, having done a bit more reading, I think spending on the Welsh Language Commissioner comes out of the budget of the Welsh Language Division (whose budget is included in the Education &amp; Skills budget), so I've probably counted her budget twice. [Cymdeithas yr Iaith cites a figure of 0.16% of expenditure](http://www.senedd.assembly.wales/documents/s30197/FIN4%20-%2015-16WGDB17%20The%20Welsh%20Language%20Society.pdf), which would be consistent with considering only the budget allocated to the Welsh Language Division.

**About you:** Combo-oily, sensitive (among others, my skin takes the habit of breaking out in hives when it doesn't like something I eat or put on my skin), SD/PD-prone. OSPW. Fitzpatrick IV.
I bought this because I wanted to try using salicylic acid for my SD.

**Your opinion:** I got a slew of Skinceuticals samples from local aesthetic clinic. I had high hope on this given the rave review, simple ingredients list and price tag.

I have been wary to try using salicylic acid due to past bad experience with Olay Anti Wrinkle Toner with Vitaniacin. But, I thought it was just the formulation and was hoping that SkinCeuticals's formula would fare better on my skin.

Wrong.

I put it on one night, there was very minor tinglong, but immediately some little red bumps popped out along my nose bridge, just like with Olay toner. I thought it may be a fluke and my skin felt alright. The next day, in addition to the aforementioned red bumps, I woke up to a few real itchy hives, weird small zits above right corner of mouth and back left jaw. The small zits occurrences were weird because those spots are the last place I would ever get break out. I couldn't stop scratching my face the whole day.

I stopped it immediately and slathered my face with Skinoren and SebaMed Clear Face Care Gel and my face calmed down pretty immediately. I presumed my use of Olay Regenerist Night Elixir the following night and my face recovered after 2 days.

Obviously enough, I won't repurchase or even finishing the sample, at least not on my face.

But think of it this way, for every 100 pounds of expenditure you have it actually costs you 79 pounds. If you had to choose between 100 pounds of training or 200 pounds of training, you'd still be spending more so your take home money would be lower.

To reach 86 points we need 22 point from our last 10 games, that's 6 wins and 4 draws, which allows us to draw all the big teams, as well as one of the other teams.

That sounds good, but we actually match City's maximum of 85 points even if we lose against United, Arsenal, and Liverpool, as long as we win the other 7 games. I doubt City will win out, so that would probably be enough.

Is it fuck.

It's the political will of an outdated voting system that allows one party to capture a majority of seats with a minority of the vote.

The SNP achieved around 45% of both the constituency and the list votes at the last elections to the Scottish Parliament yet ended up with a majority.

That means that the majority of people in Scotland voted AGAINST the SNP and did NOT back them, yet you claim that they represent the political will of a whole country?

There's little competition between the train operating companies which are now mostly owned by foreign state owned rail companies like Deutsche Bahn.

We went to Banham Zoo in Norfolk, wasnt really expecting much but spent most of the afternoon there, really rather good!

 Some highlights include; 

* Feeding the above giraffe with grass and getting our hands licked by its funny tongue in the process.
* Stroking a ring tailed lemur (very friendly) and a red ruffed lemur (less friendly, it made moves to bite me but I yelped and pulled my hand away)
* Seeing a snow leopard! Majestic doesn't cover it, although it appeared a little lonely as its friend was receiving veterinary treatment elsewhere.
* A pair of oriental short-clawed otters. Apparently the smallest otter. They were beyond cute and made adorable otter sounds at us.
* Loads of bitchin' owls. Personal favourite being the Ural owl, with the spectacled owl a very close second.

Then they had tigers (3) leopards (2) an ocelot (legs: 3) some brilliant bactrian camels, a good range of primates (pygmy marmoset FTW) and loooads more besides.

In respects to his performance yesterday I did think he was poor, couldn't get to grips with the pace of the game, however that's very difficult for any player to achieve in a game being played at that high a tempo as the last 10 minutes were, especially for a player who has had very limited premier league experience. Sat in the Matthew Harding end it also made me laugh hearing people complaining that we traded Salah for him, a player who also did very little in a blue shirt and suffered many of the same criticisms Cuadrado is experiencing now! Summed it up when I heard someone refer to Salah as Saha, most Chelsea fans haven't seen enough of either player to make an informed judgement at this stage in my opinion. 

In regards to Cuadrado I'd say judge him at the end of next year, once he's had a realistic amount of time to settle into his new surroundings!",null,0,null,1426542199,null,0,false,0,cph04bw,null,t3_2z6tyv,null,t1_cph04bw,null,t3_2z6tyv,null,null,null,1427797955,null,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1,null

The fireblade is similar because they make lots and sell lots, higher end bikes don't sell as many but still need a lot of R and D to get to that point. I've seen bikes going for 20k+ AUD, people will buy them, personally I wouldn't just because it wouldn't get me much more benefit as after a certain point it's a law of diminishing return. That 20k bike was also a limited production run, only double digits ever made, personally I wouldn't be happy if I had an accident and it was wrecked because even if you got a similar spec replacement it wouldn't be the limited run.

Membership costs for boatclubs vary considerably between colleges. Mine - Sidney Sussex Boat Club (SSBC) - is absolutely free. All you buy is your own kit. This is, I understand, quite unusual though and I'd be very surprised if First and Third is one of the free clubs.

Almost no one eats in hall for every meal, if only because you'll be at the faculty during most weekdays, so going back to college would be a faff. 
I'd say it was fairly standard to eat in hall perhaps 5-7 times a week. So just about once a day, usually dinner. Whether you can cook your own food is very dependent on whether you have access to a proper kitchen. In Sidney probably about half of the rooms have access to a kitchen with hobs and an oven, though every room in every college should have access to a 'gyp', which is a mini kitchen with stuff like a microwave, toaster, kettle, george foreman etc. Naturally of course what you can do in a gyp is limited.
Having just said this another major limiting factor is how close you live to hall. Sidneyites are lucky because all undergrads live within a five minute walk of hall. Most in fact within a two minute walk. This will not be the case for many colleges, as many have annex sites a long way away from the main college site, or have college owned houses (ie. hostels) which are a ways away.

Feel free to keep asking questions!

I kinda feel like saying ""I like to imagine that **x**"" (Where **x** is some theory) is a much weaker sentiment than saying, ""I like to imagine a relatively internally consistent, although certainly not canon, universe in which **x** is most definitely true.""

----

I could say, ""I like to imagine that Rose is actually not human. She's really an Ood."" That doesn't create any problems because it's just something I like to imagine. 

I'd have a much tougher time saying that I can create an internally consistent universe in which that's true. In that case I have to hold myself accountable for what I'm imagining.

I'd have a lot of questions that need answering:
 
- I'd have to figure out why she appears human
- who her parents are
- whether she's the only Ood the doctor has as a companion 
- whether the doctor knows
- if he doesn't know, how could he miss it?
- do the other Ood have the ability/technology to hide so effectively?
- How does this effect Mickey?
- Is there evidence to the contrary that is altogether impossible to rationalize away?
- etc, etc.

----

So yes, I suppose it's a more grandiose way of saying ""I like to imagine that..."" It's more grandiose because it's supposed to be more grandiose.

Is it self-indulgent? Absolutely, but I wouldn't say it's any more self-indulgent than imagining something. Aside from the fact that you're putting some extra time and effort into your imagining and therefore missing out on some other potentially more intrinsically selfless activities.

At what point does Sturridge see the ""Well, he's just shaking the rust off"" window shut? Don't get me wrong, I was super glad to see him back and I think he gave us a great boost when he returned to the squad but we haven't seen a whole lot since then have we? Little things such as that finish he (in my opinion) should've had at the end of this game. I'm sure he's frustrated with his own performance, but rather than piddle around he should be using that as fuel to really push him to the level he was last year. 

Again I realize and admit that I may be jumping the gun here, but I feel like it's at least a good point of discussion and I'd be really interested to hear y'all's input.

Mine is nice as well , not as good as the old Torres one but whatever . I might buy milk after this , or get a snack with Kolo. He still has to tell me the story when he and Yaya tag teamed a lion. ""Kings of Africa"" ... they might do a WWE tag team or a dance group. Jordan scored (as in Hendo) great goal , he has great hair , might put glen on he is constantly kicking my seat ... Joe is good but i might buy Shelvey back (Reminder: BUY VOLDEMORT!!!) i like his chant aswell.

**Positives**

*Jordi Amat* - I am really excited to see him back in the fold. Fernandez is fantastic, but Amat has a smoothness with the ball at his feet that you'd expect from your 10. Really want to see more of him.

*Routledgeinho*- Wonderful on the ball today. His skill this season has really improved this season and I fancy him to pass any defender he faces.

*No Nonsense Defending* - This is the biggest positive for me. Ive found that all season we've been letting teams run at us and play infront of us, this game we snuffed out every attack in the first half. Loved the effort from the boys.

*Shelvey* - An absolute rock in defense today. I'll admit I've doubted his defending many times, but how many tackles did he have today? 

**Negatives**

*Finishing* - Same shit different day. Could have been up by 2 easily in the first half, yet chance after chance was squandered.

*2nd Half* - While I would say we collapsed, our performance dipped severely. Especially after that ugly goal. 

*Nathan Dyer* - What happened to him? He went from potential England call up to absolutely abysmal! Looked slow on and off the ball.

In the end we've got to be realistic. We've played Spurs and Liverpool head on and played well enough for points in both matches. Are there issues? Yes. However I feel if we play like we did to start today we will take home all 3 against most opponents we face for the rest of the season.

* Direct link between consistency and MP. No party lists.
* Allows single-seat candidates to gain entry campaigning on local issues
* Avoids smaller parties having a disproportionate influence relative to their vote share in order to prop up a larger party
* Usually returns stable Governments 
* Also usually returns a clear opposition rather than having that opposition fragmented across parties who also oppose each other

The Cambridge Historical Tripos is weird, and amazingly hard to succinctly explain, but I will try.

* The course is split in to two Parts, Part I and Part II. Part I is your first two years and Part II is your final year. Only Part II actually counts toward your degree.

* Part I: You take six papers. Five are normal papers, for which you will go to lectures, and will do weekly essays for. You will do one paper a term, where you get set eight essays a term. You are set the question, given a reading list, you go away and read, think, read, think, read, and write a 2-3000 word essay. You then have an hour long 'supervision' with your supervisor a week who marks your essay, discusses it and the general topic for the week with you, then sets you a new essay. With this body of work, you will then be assessed with a three hour exam on each paper, in which you answer three questions. So, fifteen essays in total. The sixth paper for Part I is called Themes &amp; Sources, in which you attend eight or so seminar style classes throughout first year, then over the summer between first year, and then the Christmas vacation after that, you prepare and write a 5000 word essay on a question set on that course. So, coursework, basically.

* Notes for Part I: There are compulsory areas of study. Throughout your 6 Part I papers you must study: some British History, some European History, and some 'non-modern' history. I think the year your 'non-modern' paper must come before is 1600, but I'm not quite sure.

* Here's a list of the current Part I papers, should you be interested: http://www.hist.cam.ac.uk/undergraduate/tripos-papers/part-i-papers-2014-2015

* Part II: is much more complicated, involving some papers similar to part I, a 10000 word dissertation (though this can be avoided), and a more high-minded paper called Historical Argument and Practice, which is grim. For now though, only worry about Part I!

Basically the History Tripos is embarrassingly Anglo-Centric, and needs reforming, but what it does, it does well, and when you get to Part II you'll have a much more global set of choices from which to pick!

As for A level, I wouldn't dare give you advice, it's been far too long since I did A Levels. If you've got an offer at Cam though, you're doing alright, so just try to keep on going, you'll get there.

Feel free to ask any more questions you might have :D Congrats on the offer!!!

null,false,Buffaluffasaurus,null,null,null,"Good article, thanks for sharing.

I think the real problem with our play this season (which the article doesn't quite nail) is that pressing is less about putting pressure on the ball, and more about closing down passing channels.  When you press effectively, you're actually just gathering close to players to prevent easy passes being made.  Then, when an opposition player hesitates because he doesn't have a good passing option, you can pounce and try to make a tackle in that moment of indecision.

What we too often do is press the ball, but don't effectively pick up men or get into positions to close down passing lanes.  Which means that like the first goal here, even though we have men high up the pitch compressing space, all it took was three relatively simple passes to cut through three lines of players and score.

We're not playing smart.  And to be honest, although the performance against Utd was pitiful, these same mistakes have been present all season.

If a murderer were to kill again while on bail, it would be embarrassing for the court, but they make a sensible assessment of the risk.

The BBC could have spoken to Clarkson within hours of the incident and, realistically, he is not very likely to punch anyone again in a couple of weeks.  They could make sure he was around as little as necessary (for shooting only) and had someone with him whenever he was around others.  I think you could make a good argument that the BBC was meeting its duty of care in this way.

If you draw a parallel to football, there are numerous regrettable incidents on training grounds, but they often don't result in drastic, immediate action.  I'm a Juventus fan - there was a funny thing a few years back when Amauri locked the club president in the loo  (that's his boss' boss' boss) and refused to let him out.  Another player (Del Piero) apparently had to let him out.  Amauri, of course, couldn't really be disliked any more than he already was at the club, but still played before he was eventually loaned out to Fiorentina (funnily enough, he would go on to score a winning goal against Milan, allowing Juve to overtake them in the standings and go on to win the league).

It's normal to have a 6m or 1y initial lease. It just rolls on afterwards. I haven't been looking myself for a while, but there shouldn't be that many which are renewing in Summer? There are always a few looking to kick you out for the festival, because they can quadruple rents, but I've never seen it be all that many. Mind you, the ones that are tend to stick around because nobody wants them, whereas good flats go quite quick. 

A short-term let from now until summer - isn't that going to be giving you the problem of needing a new place around about during the festival? Summer (late summer anyway) is a bad time for flat hunting because of the festival and not long after that the undergrad students flood back and have a mad dash for flats. 

Flat hunting in Edinburgh is a bit of a pig and can take some time. This is mainly because there are quite a lot of old converted properties with, lets say odd proportions, and on top of that a lot of crap landlords who don't maintain their properties to a good standard or keep them modernised etc. Too many are just some guy who got a flat (often bought for kid going to uni, or some ideas about a second pension or whatever) and has held on to it, they're not really active landlords. Naturally that means those who get a good flat like even more to hang on to it, and there's people already in flats who browse the listings regularly just to see if something nicer comes up.

As you'll have no doubt guessed from looking at the map, you will probably want to be around the Newington area. That's the main Ed uni student living quarter. However, if you're not determined to be walking in every day your range expands dramatically. The bus service is very good and once you have to get a bus anyway an extra 5-10 mins on the journey is a lot of distance (if you're avoiding rush hour anyway).

I'm from Texas and we've got UT and A&amp;M football games, the Cowboys, etc. but even then after watching one or two games at Anfield (keep in mind this would've been 8 or 9 years ago) I was like ""Wooooow, if I can ever watch a game there I'll be so happy"". That's still a dream of mine by the way, visiting Liverpool and catching a game or two at Anfield. 

But yeah, the support and the history really drew me to the club. Not the ""Oh we've won 5 CL cup titles so I'm gonna be a bandwaggoner"" history, but the ""Look at how much this club has meant for this area of the country"" history. That's what really drew me in.

I'm a tall, skinny guy (especially when I was in high school during the '06 WC; 6'2"", 160 lbs.) and I loved Peter Crouch. I swear, that dude was an inspiration when I was playing sports in high school. He didn't seem athletic or anything so if *he* could do it? Well, so could I! (Now that I'm older I appreciate his athleticism and longevity, just wanted to note that.)

At any rate, I was watching the WC and around that time Bill Simmons (who used to be a REALLY good sportswriter, now he's just 'meh') was doing a series on how he picked his EPL team to follow. At that age in my life I wanted to be a sportswriter so I followed his articles like a hawk. He chose Tottenham if memory serves me correct. I did a similar ""methodology"" and came out with Liverpool. I **loved** the supporters of the club after researching it, was absolutely floored by the passion. Even back in '06 Liverpool never struck me as one of the clubs like Chelsea or City that just buys players for millions and uses them as dispensable. Rather to me it seemed like the guys like Gerrard, Carra, etc. were guys the club really supported. That level of loyalty stuck with me I guess. 

PS to OP: from Cali to Kenya, huh? That's an extreme move. Hope it treated you well. At the least you have some great stories to tell I imagine!

null,false,Sehs,null,null,null,"This is very random but when I was around 10 years old maybe, my dad was flying back to Canada from (or through) England and he brought me a soccer jersey as a gift. It turned out to be Liverpool shirt. This was still with Reebok. It was a short sleeve shirt but I can't remember exactly which one it was. It was probably around 2000 or 2001. From then on I would usually pick Liverpool playing FIFA and I would try to follow them more. 

A few years later I also bought a long sleeve Owen shirt and I used to wear it around a fair bit. Funny story about that actually. I had gone to school in my last year of high school and it turned out to be graduation picture day. You could bring accessories or whatever to include in your ""casual"" pictures so some people had guitars and such. I thought that things turned out well because I was wearing the Liverpool shirt so it would work out. We were taking the pictures in the library. When I went to get ready, one of the school admins told me ""No you can't wear that"". I kind of paused and was like ""Why?"" Then he looked at me and said ""You can't have a beer sponsor in your graduation picture."" I had totally forgotten about the Carlsberg logo. I had to go fetch a book from the library to cover it up so now in my picture I'm holding up this early 90s football book covering the Carlsberg logo. It's so ridiculous...

Anyway, now I have a Gerrard shirt I bought last year in Liverpool though as luck would have it, it was the early season game against Southampton. I was in the topmost row of the Anfield Road stand, it was fairly hot that day and it was quite stuffy up there. Suarez was out due to suspension and Coutinho was injured, so I didn't get to see them play. Steven Gerrard had a free kick saved right below us, we were held scoreless and Dejan Lovren of all people scored for Southampton. Out of all the fantastic games we had last season, I got one of the ""worst"" for my first at Anfield.

Either way, still cheering along! And it's funny because for a while my local hockey team the Montreal Canadiens shared owners with Liverpool through George Gillett but it's also odd because he wasn't so bad for us.

Boots didn't sell the topical medicine at NHS price (I assume because they felt that the over-the-counter Boots brand is cheaper for me) and the other two pills were charged by NHS prices (it said NHS something something Levy X on the receipt).

After, I tried following soccer in general (pretty hard since I'm in the US) but was so confused with how all the different leagues worked. Then Jisung Park went from PSV to the Mancs and that's where I started exclusively watching the EPL. I started following the Mancs like all other Koreans but then for some reason, I really liked the way Benayoun played. He soon became my favorite player (never the BIG name in the game but always works hard, creative on the ball, there when you need him), then started appreciating the likes of Kuyt along with being bedazzled by Gerrard and Torres. As seasons passed, my resentment towards the Mancs and Chelski grew (so glad Park retired to resolve the tension) and as many said... the rest is history. Thanks for this subreddit for teaching me about the deep history and general tactics of the game. I am now a diehard Liverpool fan.

What are they chanting? What's that song they're singing at the beginning/end of games? I had to know. I learned more and more about the club and every little bit seemed to fit.

You will never be able to know an entire paper, in fact most supervisors probably don't. The most common thing is for you to choose half of a paper to focus on, such as the first or second half of the chronology of the paper, and choose topics from that half. Exams for each paper will contain ~25 questions, of which you have to answer three. I've done a few mock papers now, and I don't think I've ever felt capable of comfortably answering more than five questions in a given paper. That's probably my revision style though, hence why I'm bricking it about Part I :)

East Asian history can be done, though will be very limited in Part I. There are a couple of world history papers, of which I did one, Paper 21. This gives you some opportunity to study Asia, as it includes topics on the Ottomans, Russia, India, China and Japan, though often the periods being studied will be those after Europeans got involved, so it's often sadly quite Eurocentric.

British political history on the other hand is extremely well served in Cambridge History :) Papers 2-6 are all British political history:
2. British political history, 380-1100
3. British political history, 1050-1509
4. British political history, 1485-1714 
5. British political history, 1688-1886 
6. British political history, since 1880 
I did Paper 4 and really quite enjoyed it. I had David Smith as a Supervisor, who wrote easily the most useful book on the period, and is a lovely guy to boot. That's one of the things with Cam, you really do get to be taught by the best :)

Thanks for this post, I just realized I've been a supporter for over half my life (im 26 now.) 

It was the fall of 2001, I was thirteen and had just moved to Ivory Coast with my family. Going to an international school instead of an American one, soccer was everything among the kids, everyone had a team. I had been a big michael owen fan since the 98 world cup. Lpool had just won the treble (I guess that makes me a bit of a glory hunter) and Liverpool were having a great season in 01-02 I don't remember exactly when I hopped on, but I do remember it feeling right. I like to think we chose each other. 

I'm a sucker for rooting for the good guys and to me Liverpool Football Club and their supporters are the good guys. In so many ways this club feels right to me.

null,false,MrJohz,eng-westmidlands,West Midlands,null,"See, you're conflating people's rights to do things, and people's responsibility towards others.  Both are entirely relevant to the issue.  After all, it is entirely allowable for you to go around swearing at everyone you see, being generally obnoxious, but ensuring that you don't cause anyone any harm.  But then you'd be falling foul of - and I'd hesitate to call it Wheaton's Law, because the whole point is that it isn't a law - Wheaton's Advisory.  You're being a dick.  There's no rule against it, there's no law against it, and no country should ever legislate against it, but that doesn't mean you should do it.

With this in mind, it's entirely relevant whether someone is offended by something you do.  The point of speaking freely isn't simply to go around offending people, but that when you do offend someone, you do it for a worthwhile reason.  Take the Charles Hedbo cartoonists.  They drew Mohammed to make a political and social statement.  They knew that it would offend, but then they know that most of their work will be offensive to someone.  However, the aim wasn't to simply offend (that would be being dickish) but to expound some sort of message, that being what a satirical cartoonist's job is to do.

On the other hand, there are often good reasons not to draw Mohammed in an image.  Drawing Mohammed does offend a lot of people.  Sure, it offends the terrorists and murderers who repeatedly attempt to destroy our freedom of speech, but then they're already offended, so that hasn't changed anything there.  On the other hand, it's also offending countless Muslims who don't want to wage war on the evil Capitalist Western Pigs, but also don't want to see images of their greatest prophet being fucked by a pig all over the place.  (And yes, we're not talking about sensible representations that - while disputable in necessity - don't attempt to actively incite anger.  The issue is when we try and actively offend others.)

There are further issues in that those demanding that drawings of Mohammed should be everywhere also very often conflate Islam (a religion with a wide, wide range of adherents) and ISIS and co (groups of murderers using any excuse they can to murder those they don't like).  A lot of the professional cartoonists in the wake of the CH murders were actually very powerful despite not immediately portraying Mohammed in their art.  The perpetrators weren't just ""Muslims"", and so drawing art that deliberately attacks ""Islam"" is, well, missing the point.  On the other hand, cartoons that point out the futility of violence against art, the irony of pencils being so scary to terrorists, the stupidity of mindless murder, and the terror that is ISIS - these are accurate, worthwhile uses of the right to free speech.

I'd also like to note that the bloke who went to jail for singing a song was, in fact, singing a song notoriously connected with sectarian violence, that has been stamped out by all parties involved, whilst travelling to a game involving teams with one of the most bloody and violent rivalries in sport right now.

Yeah, that's cool, although without much more information there's not very far we can go with it...  :P

&gt; But I don't think that cartoonists have any responsibility to avoid offending Muslims. In fact, I don't think anyone has.

See, is this specifically cartoonists and Muslisms, or anyone and anyone?  Because with the former, I suspect I can see your argument.  Cartoons, like much of the fourth estate, has a specific role to play in society.  It's why America at least (I suspect other countries, but I honestly don't know enough about free speech laws elsewhere) has specific freedoms to ensure freedom of press that extend beyond basic freedom of speech.  Now here there are of course issues when it comes to defining who actually is part of that fourth estate, but for now let's go with the idea of satire being humour aimed at bringing to light issues within the object of mockery.  It's not simply about insulting something or someone, but about making some sort of political or social statement.

I guess what I'm saying is that I fundamentally disagree with the idea that no-one has any responsibility to avoid offence.  You do have a responsibility to avoid offence.  Not a legal one, but a moral one that is admittedly extremely nebulous, largely because there are so many exceptions where offence is necessary.  I'm sorry if I seem to keep on calling you a dick, this is more directed at the general ""one"" rather than the specific ""you"", but when one does set out solely to offend, one is being a dick - Wheaton's Law, while a truly awful law, I would argue is entirely on point as a moral guideline.  Being a dick is wrong - not necessarily wrong enough that we should start enacting legislation to ban offence, but wrong enough that I, at least, would disapprove of someone who sets out deliberately to offend.  I recognise that's perhaps one of the weakest and limpest statements I could possibly make on the matter - but tbh that's the strongest we can be when it comes to solely moral judgements.  The line about fighting to the death to defend someone else's right to say something that one disagrees with comes to mind - I certainly believe that cartoonists should be *able* to insult the wider Muslim population if they feel it to be necessary.  On the other hand, I'm sceptical that most cartoons that simply aim to depict Mohammed offending others are necessary in any way.",null,0,null,1426553393,null,0,false,0,cph6fla,null,t3_2z8v1j,null,t1_cph6fla,null,t1_cph5n3x,null,null,null,1427801001,null,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2,null

Well there's a balanced and well-thought out argument.

I'm not saying that cartoonists have to justify themselves to me.  That's precisely the opposite of what I'm saying.  I'm deliberately stating that I have no right to assert any control over a cartoonist nor other person, nor are they required to listen to any of the things I say.  That is definitely one of my fundamental points.  (I'm also not saying that there should be no drawings of Mohammed - I'm specifically talking about images designed to offend Muslims.)  However, I don't think they should do it.  If I were them, I would choose not to do it.  If I were the cartoonists' mothers, I would advise them against it.  If I were chatting to them in the pub, I'd tell them how pointless and unhelpful I thought it was.  However, they should still definitely be allowed to do it.

Tbh, not being a dick sums up the issue quite well, and is fairly obvious in what it's trying to say, so I use it as a handy shortcut.  However, if you want me to be more explicit, then doing something for the sake of offending others is - I would argue - morally wrong.  On the basis that I and you have equal rights, then I would argue that this implies equal respect.  I would therefore argue that I should treat you with the respect that I would like to be treated - in this case, assuming I were offended by images of the most important messenger from God being drawn crudely for the sake of insult\*, then I would choose not to draw images that I know to offend others.

\* As someone with a religion myself, I don't know how to make a good comparison to something that you (I assume you have no religion?) would feel the same passion for.

I could half my TV costs by acknowledging the truth that I don't need to pay a TV licence.

The BBCs charter is up for renegotiation soon. If people love the BBC, the government can't play hardball. If people are annoyed at the BBC, the government can fuck 'em. 

I've outlined what I think they should have done. Basically, assigned him an ""anti-bodyguard"" ( i.e. to guard other people), limit his time at work to the bare minimum and investigate while shooting. That way when you issue the low-key statement (which was reported on Radio 4 by 7am, so hardly low-key) you can give a final result, say ""Clarkson was fined £100,000 for punching a co-worker"" or ""Clarkson was fired for punching a co-worker"" and not give vague information leading to all sorts of speculation.  You wouldn't get a petition signed by nearly a million people if you gave sensible information.

The main goal here has to be the protection of the victim and I'm just not sure the BBCs actions are entirely in his interest.  One example is how it's led to death threats; another is how he's had his name all over the papers, with little regard to his privacy in terms of injury, hospital visit etc (I'd be livid about that).

There's just something about the history and atmosphere that clicked with me, and the Suarez and Sturridge combo didn't hurt. That's how I was brought on board, even picked up a Sturridge jersey recently.

You have the Master, the Doctor regenerating, the eye of harmony, etc. That said, even though the story would have worked better without McCoy, I love that they included 7s regeneration.   

The book, The Nth Doctor, is about all the failed attempts at Doctor Who movies before the TV Movie and also shows how the 1996 film was developed. On its own it's a great read. I'd definitely recommend it.

null,false,backtowriting,null,null,null,"&gt;Well there's a balanced and well-thought out argument.

Point taken.  Religion is absurd because it's based on myth.  God/Allah/Jehovah doesn't actually exist.  The fact that people have based their entire lives in devotion (and even submission) to a completely non-existent entity is *absurd*, not to mention tragic, not to mention often dangerous for the rest of us who have grown up.

&gt;If I were them, I would choose not to do it.

OK.  If I can parse that argument - I think what you're really saying is that if the cartoonists were only able to appreciate Muslim's hurt over these cartoons then they would be remiss if they continued to extend that hurt with more cartoons.  You're appealing to the moral principle that it's wrong to cause hurt in others.

But, that kind of argument just doesn't work when it comes to ideas.  Our society would grind to a halt if we self-censored ourselves from criticizing ideas which people are emotionally invested in so as to avoid hurting others.  Why?  Because the only way we can sort out the good from the bad ideas is to allow *all* ideas to be subject to constant scrutiny, no matter how many people's feelings are hurt.

Consider what happens in a subject as apparently controversy free as mathematics.  Imagine that mathematician A publishes a result, which he hopes will make his career.  He's worked hard on it and so is incredibly emotionally invested in it being true.  OK then, he publishes said result.  But now, imagine that mathematician B thinks that the result could be wrong.  Does she have *any* ethical responsibility to avoid trying to disprove that result?  What about if she knows that by doing so she will devastate the feelings of mathematician A? 

Of course, I think the answer is no, and probably, so do you.  But let's imagine that mathematicians were brim-full of empathy and so avoided any challenging of each other's papers if they thought it would result in hurt feelings.  What would happen?  I suggest, nothing less than the complete halt of progress in that field.

Edit: I put a lot of effort into this comment and I was still downvoted.  Gah.

Outside Welsh medium schools Welsh language lessons feel like a tacked on sort of thing, I can't imagine many people becoming fluent with them even if they wanted to, I know I didn't. I'd also say the same about foreign language learning as well, unless you take the subject further, you're probably not going to know much more then how to say Hello in French by the time you leave.

If we really want Wales to be a bilingual society then we should make all our nurseries and infant school's bilingual, with children learning Welsh though immersion. That would basically guarantee that every child in Wales would be fluent in both Welsh and English.

Whether or not they choose to use it would be their own decision, and I'm sure there would be a few that would loose their fluent-ness, but at the very least I'd imagine there would be less animosity over the language if they've known it all their lives, rather then something they're forced to learn later in life.

I missed the first 3 minutes and was shocked that we already were trailing 1-0. The Lescott overhead(ish) goal late on, thought surely it was the equalizer with almost no stoppage time remaining.  The reaction/celebration of the players was unforgettable.  Then Young marched down the pitch and scored a shocker in about 15 seconds.  I was stunned, but regardless of the result I was hooked!

But for me this goes one step further, because the bystander effect is when people don't intervene with a problem caused by another often through the unexpected shock, but this is people encouraging the problem and making that choice to egg them on and being drawn *to* it instead of walking by. I think each can be measured by the amount of people present in how likely they are to happen, but the context is very different in terms of the effects of the intoxication of the mob.

You're not aware that ridicule is normally rude? How odd.

&gt;Do you concede that ridicule can have a pedagogical purpose?

I don't need to 'concede' it because I haven't denied it. Of course it can. Now, do you 'concede' my point about ridicule driving people to extremes? And being a bad way to change people's minds? You seem to have conveniently ignored these points so far.

&gt;That it can expose why false ideas are wrong?

No, ridicule never exposes bad ideas in the sense of laying them open. Reason exposes bad ideas. Ridicule can, however, make people guilty for holding certain beliefs/doing certain things. Sometimes that is a desired result. I think ridicule is a good way to get a child to stop picking his nose in public, for example. But ridicule is also a very bad way to go other kinds of changes.

&gt;For instance, a professor might ridicule a creationist argument by taking it absolutely seriously in order to expose its contradictions.

No, I explicitly replied, 'Of course it can,' when you asked if I thought ridicule could have an pedagogical purpose. My point is that mockery *in itself* does not show flawed thinking.

null,false,Pucker_Pot,lfc99,,null,"Yes!!!! What a massive win. Going into this, I feared our luck might've run out (lacklustre vs. Blackburn) and we were going to slip into our pre-December form again. But a really solid defensive display coupled w/ a bit of luck saw us through. Woeful in the first half, but ground the last 30 minutes out well. Completely neutralised Swansea and passed them to death.

*Mignolet* was immense. Not just the three top class saves, but he was dominant in his area. His performance, more than any other this season, makes look worth hanging onto for next couple of seasons &amp; that he may be a better keeper than anyone in the PL apart from De Gea/Courtois. Three months ago it looked an absolute certainty we needed to replace him.

*Skrtel* was a rock too; some great tackles &amp; headers. IMO he and Mignolet (and Lucas previously) have been key to our clean sheets these last few months.

*Sakho* was shockingly poor in the 1st half. Defensively he was OK, but there were 2-3 times he gave the ball away and gave Swansea chances. Better teams would've punished us. He doesn't look comfortable on the ball (even his successful passes are awkward), though Swansea did well making sure he couldn't pass to Allen/Hendo/Moreno. He's our no. 2 CB for sure though, and part of his struggle w/ passing was down to Swansea flooding the passing areas in front of him.

*Sturridge* was poor once again (apart from his assist for the goal &amp; that chance at the end). He  flopped good chances in the first half and otherwise didn't make many good runs. I worry that his pace is gone since the injuries (as of this match he's had enough time to be match fit). He has been incredibly consistent (goals/min) despite injuries previously, and is obviously a great finisher (it's not like he's missing sitters), so I'm still hoping he can finish the season well and give us the bump we need for 4th place. In the first half, we played a lot like United have this season; shit but creating a few good chances. Difference is we didn't take them. We really need another striker of Sturridge's quality (or better) next season for both the added competition &amp; injury backup.

*Gerrard* did well when he came on, and we played much better as a team with him (though not necessarily due to him). Seemed like we were playing 3 in the middle for the last 30 minutes - which worked given that Swansea had Henderson/Allen blocked out in the 1st half (against Besiktas we were flooded in the middle too). I want to see Gerrard play against United, but I still don't think he fits in the 3-4-3. Doesn't have the legs to press as a front three, and we've done really poor this season (and a bit of last season) when Gerrard's played as part of a middle two. (Super sub for Lallana in the 70th minute &amp; scores a FK, fingers crossed!).

*Allen* is such a good player to have in our squad. He had to work *very* hard to get near the ball, but he had plenty of key tackles/passes. Hope he continues to get better and better. I don't think he'll ever be a guaranteed first team player for us, but he is such a sound player to rotate in &amp; it seems like he carries out Rodger's tactics better than anyone.

*Sterling* had a poor match. He beats players, gets down the line etc., but lately he doesn't put a good ball in (though that's partly due to Sturridge not finding space). If I'm being honest, this isn't too bad. Back in December it looked like Sterling was the only top player we have and that he'd be irreplacable if we sold him. But despite all the contract talk, we don't actually look that reliant on him. If RM or someone gives us  an-offer-we-can't-refuse in lieu of him signing a contract this summer, it wouldn't be nearly as bad as us losing Henderson/Coutinho (and even Mignolet/Skrtel) based on current performances.",null,0,null,1426559498,null,0,1426561953,0,cph9zoy,null,t3_2za392,null,t1_cph9zoy,null,t3_2za392,null,null,null,1427802661,null,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3,null

As everyone is thinking the same, the situation becomes a stale mate. We become stuck, and at the same time we notice everyone else stuck, which feeds into our instincts that we shouldn't do anything. We're surrounded by a group of people not doing anything and the pressure to conform keeps us doing exactly what everyone else is doing.

The longer time goes on, the more embarrassing it would be to break from the crowd and act independently.

Essentially it's all driven by a fear of going against the crowd. Which would explain why the larger the crowd, the less likely people are to help

Second, at least Long was a first team regular when he was bought, as was McCormack. I think you're overestimating what Borini would yield compared to the offers he had from Sunderland/QPR. I'd be surprised if he brought half of the £14m that was on the table last year.

So, my question remains: what clubs would come close to offering Borini that type of money. And, as far as Serie A, I'd be shocked if any clubs offered anything near what could've been had.

Truth is, I just don't think he is that great a manager. It has nothing to do with the formation for me, but at the same token, I don't give him all the credit in the world for last season.

* It doesn't necessarily pay **for** the roads - it just goes into a general pot of government funds, same as most taxes
* It **is** a tax on (some) vehicles. Which could be seen as at least partly linked to their propensity to pollute, since cycles and electric cars don't pay it (among a handful of other exemptions)

So your answer... something along the lines that the tax is attaching a cost to pollution and road-damage, which you aren't causing any of with your bike.

null,false,2ToTooTwoFish,BnW,,null,"&gt;When the draw was made Busquets admitted that Barcelona were initially disappointed, but soon concluded that they were facing a side that “let you play”. The obvious if simplistic conclusion then is don’t. Not necessarily, Pellegrini argues. Tactical naivety is invariably associated with attacking teams but being defensive can be equally naive and just as likely to fail. “We’ve tried to attack, except last year at home when we approached it differently, trying to stop Barcelona being Barcelona ... and that didn’t work,” Pellegrini says.

&gt;“If we just waited deep with 180 minutes to play, they’d create chances and we’re not a team [constructed] to play like that. We haven’t always played as I know we can; if we had done, playing our way, and it still wasn’t enough, then you can think: ‘Let’s change our style.’ But that hasn’t been the case. And our identity is to have a big-team mentality, to go to win. And now losing 2-1, we have to attack.

&gt;“Barcelona will want a slow game, we’ll want a fast one, but we have to be intelligent. They have no time pressure and the less haste you have, the fewer mistakes you make. We have to avoid being precipitate; we have to be calm. I always say to the players: have a hot heart and a cool head.”

This was at the end of the interview. I don't think he's tactically naive. He's right, sitting back and absorbing pressure is not the way this team plays or should play. If we want to be a team as big as Barcalona or Real Madrid (who don't have to change their style of play dramatically depending on the teams they play) then we need to have a manager who is confident in his tactics and players, so we can start controlling matches consistently. Also, in my opinion, criticisms of the last match were quite weak, since we were on the front foot in the second half until the Clichy red card.",null,0,null,1426570441,null,0,false,0,cphf4xi,null,t3_2z9bqn,null,t1_cphf4xi,null,t1_cpgto34,null,null,null,1427805132,null,3,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,3,null

Eric Roberts stomps around like a Terminator cosplayer, and then now and then has moments that are so *perfectly* the Master: the camp of 'I always dress for the occasion,' the doublesided whiplash comforting Chang Lee before snapping his neck ('say something nice~!').  Though really, his two best moments are his snarling philosophy of ""Life is WASTED on the living,"" and the moment when he corrects Grace's grammar.  Because he's showing off how intelligent he is, one-upping a human, correcting something that honestly irks him, and pissing off the Doctor in four words, and it's so perfectly him.

And it's a wonderfully fitting end for Seven--who, after manipulating everybody around him for decades, is isolated and alone, and is so convinced of his own genius that he neglects to check what's outside and dies in a hail of gunfire.

If you are set on buying from a physical shop though, then you're not going to go too far wrong with any major retailer.

Brand-wise, I'd say any of the following would be OK:

* Lenovo (now they've got rid of their adware - the hardware is pretty decent business-spec stuff most of the time, but I understand this is a contentious point as they have lost a lot of trust)
* Toshiba
* Dell
* HP


I'd recommend steering clear of Acers - in my experience they have been poorly constructed, flimsy machines that don't last long. 

As for a specific spec or model level, based on your comment below about a ""glorified reddit machine"" I'd say don't be pushed into buying a fancy fast  thing with lots of bells and whistles. The salespeople are likely to want to try and bump you up a model or two because it gets them a bigger commission. 

Try and stick around the following marks:

* 4GB or 8GB of RAM
* Intel Vs AMD for the processor makes no difference so I'll outline both below. AMD tends to be slightly cheaper but this might not be reflected in the overall cost of the unit - pick the best value for money regardless of who made the processor. Everything runs on both types these days.
* Intel i3 or i5 processor (i7 is the bigger brother and will likely be more power than you need) - the lower the number (5300 vs 5800 for example) the slower it will be - try and go for a higher-middle line one if you find a good i3 or a lower-middle line one for i5. Don't go for the cheapest or most expensive. 
* AMD have come up with what they call an Accelerated Processing Unit (APU) - this combines a graphics card and a processor onto one chip inside the laptop - Intel do the same with most of the i processors. Look for something in the A6 range (A6-6400K for example) or A8 range.
* HDD - If you can get a laptop with a 256GB or 512GB SSD - that's large enough to hold a pretty decent amount of stuff, and because it's an SSD (Solid State Disk) it's about 10x faster than a ""traditional"" HDD. If you can't find/afford an SSD then a conventional disk is fine, go for one around the 500GB mark.

Screen size is personal choice - a 15.4"" screen is decent for a laptop that you want to carry around without being too cumbersome most of the time, but if you need to carry it all the time you might be better off going with a 13.3"". 17"" and above screens are available, but these make the laptops much more expensive and almost precludes moving them around a lot as they are a lot heavier and more bulky.

null,false,Sir_Bantersaurus,null,null,null,"&gt; True, but this is in reference to a discussion about switching over to PR. If these things aren't unique to FPTP and can be maintained in under a PR system then it offers no benefit in a comparison and we'd have nothing to lose.

They aren't unique to FFTP but they are not well implemented in PR systems. I am unaware of an example that works well. As I said the European Elections attempt it with regional lists for each party but it's a mess and the area covered means it's also redundant. It keeps the symbolism of a MEP being representative of a constituency but loses the real link. People like the concept that they have an MP who they can write too and who can lobby on their behalf in Parliament. 

That is what we would lose. Instead, at best, we would have an adapted form of the model used for Europe whereby we have a collection of theoretical 'constituencies' for which each party provides a list of representatives that are then allocated seats according to share of the vote in that constituency. It provides more power to the party than the individual as the formation of the list is almost entirely the result of the central party's selection process and consistency parties are marginalised. 

One of the issues people have with Westminster is the parachuting in of party favourites who have no link to the area and are career politicians assigned a safe seat. This makes this a lot worse.

&gt; In that case nothing would change regardless since independent MPs are nonexistent in British politics. In the last fifty years we've had a small handful of MPs who have managed to win without being in a party.

Yes that isn't something we see a lot although you do have the case of George Galloway recently. That type of insurgency would be stopped. 

I actually want a PR system. However I think people give it too much credit and dismiss the benefits of FFTP too easily. There is no perfect system and PR does have drawbacks as well. I think that FFTP breaks down in the current climate because of the amount of people voting for minority parties but that doesn't mean that it is an insane system otherwise.",null,0,null,1426582322,null,0,false,0,cphi4va,null,t3_2z9ekz,null,t1_cphi4va,null,t1_cphh5pm,null,null,null,1427806531,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

He was starting games for them before he joined us, he even scored a hat-trick in his final game for them. It's not surprising that he's be somewhat disillusioned.

So going from a squad player for the best team in the world at the time, being sold (probably against his own will), and then almost immediately being loaned to Ipswich was probably a bit depressing for him. It would be like playing Lamela a handful of times and then loaning him out to some very poor team in the middle of nowhere in a brand new country. Given how long it's taken him to settle playing for us, imagine how much longer it would have taken if we shipped him out straightaway (despite playing averagely for us). Dos Santos has done pretty decently in Spain since he left.

I also think it's bad form to try and judge a player based on what people say about him off the pitch. Unless you work with the club, you have absolutely no idea what goes on behind the scenes.

Depends on what really. It strikes me Labour could probably naturally rely on the SNP to pass most of their welfare reform legislation. If they didn't back it, it could hurt the SNP domestically. Labour could also rely on conservative support to pass controversial (in Scotland) legislation like a bill legislating funding for a trident replacement program. 

As I've said throughout, the Scottish position is deceptively weak. They have relatively few concessions they are even able to make.. and even fewer they will be willing to make.

I can't say I've ever seen the issue of rental renewals focusing on June/July/August, with the exception of the short-term lets for festival season (which you do NOT want to get, as they'll be pulling money from your eyeballs). If you haven't already read it, give [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Edinburgh/comments/2q4f03/how_to_find_a_property_to_rent_in_edinburgh_read/) a read as it has a good overview for moving to Edinburgh (not sure why it isn't in the sidebar actually).

The area you're wanting to live in is a great area, although because of this it is reallly expensive. You've said you're happy to pay up to £1200/month, is this for rent only, or to include all your bills? 

My advice would be to expand your search a little to be a 10-15 minute bus ride rather than a 20 minute walk. Edinburgh is fantastic for public transport, and a lot of services run 24/7. If you see a place you like further than 20 minutes walk, check it on [here](http://www.lothianbuses.com/plan-a-journey/journey-planner) to make sure it's on a convenient bus route for you. Single tickets are £1.50, and a monthly bus pass is about £50 - if you're saving £150+ on rent this is going to be worth it.

I grew up in Hampshire. About 2 miles down the road was a large sewage treatment works. On a good day it stunk... bad, really bad. On a windy day it was like walking through an aerosolised perfume of a 100,000 peoples shit. You can imagine how the locals felt about it. Every other edition of the local newspaper ran a story about a saga of locals trying to have it closed.

The problem is, everyone loves having their sewage drained away and not dieing of cholera. If I had to rate it, I'd say not dieing of cholera is 10/10. The flip side is nobody wants to be the person who has to live next to the sewage treatment works that makes that possible. Sometimes central governments have to make choices that are domestically unpopular because they are deemed to be necessary.

It's unfortunate that Scots don't like the Trident program and don't want it on the Clyde. Thats as far as my sympathy goes.

&gt; Leaving the UK's nuclear arsenal dependent on Scotland remaining in the union for the next 35 years?

The cost of moving it is so prohibitively expensive I doubt any government is going to pump billions of pounds of infrastructure spending into an unnecessary relocation unless they really up against a wall over the issue - which they aren't. So while it may be (for the reasons you pointed out) an imperfect solution, it is none the less a solution to leave it where it is.

&gt; The reality is that if Faslane goes up, Scotland loses half its population in the fall-out

No. The reality is if a nuclear bomb went off anywhere in the UK we'd all be fucked. That's the bottom line, that's the purpose of nuclear weapons - the threat of total destruction. A) The fallout carried by the wind (for which this set of islands has an abundance) would render most of nation uninhabitable and destroy our peoples and our culture as we know it. It would literally be the destruction of the British. B) If someone felt the need to hit our nuclear establishment with a nuclear weapon of their own then chances are they wouldn't be dropping just one, and it would be part of comprehensive pre-emptive strike package that would see our entire nation destroyed or rendered uninhabitable for the foreseeable future.  The other possible nuclear target would be a terrorist ""dirty"" bomb in which case they are unlikely to hit the hardened facilities on the Clyde and are more likely to hit a densely populated and ideologically driven target like London. 

&gt; I wonder if you can explain the strategic value of Faslane as opposed to somewhere else? 

Nuclear weapons ended up on the Clyde because submarines were already based there since the early 20th century. It is one of only 3 UK ports that has a harbour deep enough to allow a submarine to enter and leave submerged. The other two are Devonport and Milford Haven. Putting aside the huge cost of moving this sort of facility and the decades it would take, neither of the alternatives are as good as Faslane - which is situated close to the strategically important **[Greenland-Iceland-UK gap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIUK_gap)** (GIUK Gap). The gap is an expanse of sea through which the Russian northern fleet can gain access to the Atlantic ocean. Essentially its a big part of our contribution to NATO - the ability to deny or constrain Russian access to the Atlantic and the eastern seaboard of the USA and the western coasts of Europe. I appreciate that might seem like some ridiculous 1980s cold war concept, but hopefully recent world events have demonstrated that the USA still takes Russia very seriously and they take our NATO commitment seriously to. Patrolling the GIUK gap is part of the broader strategy of cultural and military ""**[containment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Containment)**"" which in many respects largely remains in effect despite the end of the cold war.

Young man, in the next 2 months you are about to witness an incredible political concept... uncertainty. The effect it has on business, on the economy and on the machinations of the state is frightening to behold. The bottom line is people are generally keen to avoid it, and politicians particularly so. If we go to a second election, chances are there will be a clearer division of votes and an odds-on party. It's possible Scottish voters could stick to their guns and vote SNP again, but the flip side is you'd probably see a reversal of minority parties and even the lib dems in England.

&gt; it's most likely to be the SNP stopping either party getting a majority in the UK

That probably isn't true. Even with the SNP labour would have a very weak majority of relatively few seats.

The left of the party (e.g. Tim Farron, and Vince Cable to some extent) have been a bit sidelined for the past few years (mostly self-imposed, to maintain distance from the current government). These are the frontrunners to take over the leadership in May, especially Farron.

The centrists (e.g. Clegg, Alexander, Lamb, Davey) have held the leadership since 2007 and hold most of the important ministerial posts in the current coalition government. They're comfortable with pragmatic compromise with the Conservatives, and have obviously been tainted by this. They will struggle to put forward a credible leadership contender when Clegg goes - there are some signs that they might unite around Norman Lamb, but even then, I can't really see him beating Farron.

The right of the party (e.g. Jeremy Browne, and David Laws to some extent) have never held significant popularity within the party.

null,false,Bilgistic,eng-GreaterLondon,Civilisation,null,"&gt; They aren't unique to FFTP but they are not well implemented in PR systems. I am unaware of an example that works well. As I said the European Elections attempt it with regional lists for each party but it's a mess and the area covered means it's also redundant. It keeps the symbolism of a MEP being representative of a constituency but loses the real link. People like the concept that they have an MP who they can write too and who can lobby on their behalf in Parliament.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; That is what we would lose. Instead, at best, we would have an adapted form of the model used for Europe whereby we have a collection of theoretical 'constituencies' for which each party provides a list of representatives that are then allocated seats according to share of the vote in that constituency. It provides more power to the party than the individual as the formation of the list is almost entirely the result of the central party's selection process and consistency parties are marginalised.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; One of the issues people have with Westminster is the parachuting in of party favourites who have no link to the area and are career politicians assigned a safe seat. This makes this a lot worse.

That's only true under a system where we have massive constituencies, which doesn't need to be the case. Something like MMP for example still produces results that are largely proportional yet has local representation at the same time.

Also I'm not sure why you think FPTP is better for fighting against safe seats. Currently the overwhelming majority of seats are safe. Of the 600 we'll have in 2015 there will only be a fifth or so that'll be up for a contest.

&gt; I actually want a PR system. However I think people give it too much credit and dismiss the benefits of FFTP too easily. There is no perfect system and PR does have drawbacks as well. I think that FFTP breaks down in the current climate because of the amount of people voting for minority parties but that doesn't mean that it is an insane system otherwise.

This isn't new though. FPTP has been disproportionate for several decades and we've even had elections where the winning party didn't even get the highest number of votes. There's nothing good about FPTP that'll be lost in one of the PR systems.",null,0,null,1426587782,null,0,false,0,cphj7bd,null,t3_2z9ekz,null,t1_cphj7bd,null,t1_cphi4va,null,null,null,1427807029,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

I disagree, I have 10 years NCB on my car and have drove tons, if that doesn't go a decent way to me being safer on the roads on a motorbike then whatever.

Tell me how that 17 year old is better equipped to deal with road traffic than someone with years of experience, **specifically** in anticipating other road users and forward hazard awareness whilst doing speeds &gt;30mph, which is not the same at all to cycling to school in the gutter at 10-15mph or less, and are going to be the skills that you need to be good at.

[The stats would *suggest* otherwise btw](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/10169/ras30025.xls)

30-39 year olds look to have much less casualties than 16-19, across both &lt;50cc and &gt;50cc. I know that not all of those 30 year olds would have been driving for x amount of time, the &lt;50cc stats are skewed in favour of the older ones and correlation != causation and blah, but they suggest something, that people with more life experience end up on the floor less. 

Whether that's because they have already had the car licence and done the car thing before a motorbike, so have some knowledge of fast moving roads, or because they aren't pulling stoppies outside Londis to impress girls, who the fuck knows.. but dem da stats

Let me explain this in simple terms. You spend money, this opens new businesses, gets more people employed in meaningful jobs &amp; spurs growth. This increases tax receipts (personal taxes, corporation taxes etc, government revenue basically), which reduces the amount of money the government has to borrow. This reduces the deficit &amp; our national debt as a % of GDP.

&gt; Using a phone causes physical, visual, mental and auditory distractions, leading to significantly slower reaction times

They are not talking about properly integrated phones...

I'm not touching my phone, my hands don't move.   I say ""Hey Cortana, Text Mum ....""  That's it, followed by a Send to signify I'm done.

I have an RP voice, so it's fairly accurate, I also wouldn't include anything obscure (having a background in ML, I've a fair grasp of this).

Also I'm not saying it doesn't have an impact on operator workload, it clearly will, as will almost anything.  It was raining for an hour last time I drove.  Should I have stopped?  Waited for the perfect weather.  No, of course not, my car is equipped with good tires, windscreen wipers, esp etc.  Off into the mild drizzle and 8m+ vis I went.  Again, this is a distraction, it increases operator load, but I drive accordingly, good sized gaps, whilst being mindful of the effect on the surface.

The fact is, I wouldn't decide to send a text message, or acknowledge a call whilst merging on the m25, say around the junction with the m4 northbound where it frequently goes bat shit crazy, because operator workload is too high.  This is the 10% I'm talking about.

This is why I'm legally allowed to use my phone in that manner, because I can be trusted.  The thing is I see many people holding theirs in built up areas and the like, this is already illegal, so I don't think the law needs to be changed, just enforced.

It's good you used the IAM link, I completed their fast track advanced course a while back.

A lot of what I do is online, however I do spend quite a bit of face-time with my clients.

I think I possess quite a good skill in that I can explain highly technical/complicated terms in a very basic fashion, and I'm not a 'penny pincher.' 

The technique I find that usually scores me business is in that most web design &amp; marketing businesses are very sketchy and unstructured in their pricing.

I presume you've seen [this](http://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/accommodation) and [this](http://www.accom.ed.ac.uk/new-and-prospective-students/postgraduates/) and [this](http://www.accom.ed.ac.uk/media/4310/pg%20guide%202014.pdf).

It's all mostly self-catered as far as I know. 

The only advice I'd have is to apply as soon as possible as accommodation isn't guaranteed for MSc students.  Uni accommodation is always cheaper than renting privately as heating, electricity and internet are included in the bill.  

I think artificial intelligence is taught around George Square, so just pick somewhere near the central campus that looks appealing.  You'll make friends and have a lovely time wherever you live.  Fact.

null,false,MobyDobie,null,null,null,"What you're missing is that all governments since the Major era cheated by having ""off books"" debts.  Major cheated in a small way, but Gordon Brown as Chancellor cheated on a massive scale.

The way they generated ""off book"" debts, was private finance initiatives (PFIs).  This recorded as paying the private sector for services on an ongoing basis (and sometimes committing to do so for 25, 35, 50, or more years), but in reality was a way of avoiding taking a loan to pay to rebuild a school or hospital, or buy a transport plane, or buy a military transport ship, or whatever.   Many of the PFI deals from this era were exceptionally bad deals for the tax payer - but the government took them, as they weren't recorded as debt.  (remember the Euro was still on the table when this started, and debt ratio was one of the criteria).

Of course much of this PFI stuff dried up, once the financial crisis hit, and the private sector wasn't awash with funds either.

So as well as the debt that the UK has on the books, there is a massive off-books debt, a lot of which was thanks to Gordon Brown.   We are committed to pay ""rent"" (in reality repaying loans) on schools, hospitals, ships, and even transport planes, for the next 25/35/50/more years.....  even if those buildings aren't still standing, or the planes aren't flying.",null,0,null,1426592753,null,0,1426606047,0,cphkcfv,null,t3_2zbod4,null,t1_cphkcfv,null,t1_cphj26m,null,null,null,1427807563,null,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

If Dier moves wider in those situations that probably leaves Rooney 1v1 with Vertonghen and another basic rule of defending is the centerbacks want to always maintain a +1 against center forwards. That happens and we could just as easily be talking about Rooney's hat trick sinking Spurs.

Like Neville said, in game, you fix the problem with something you can communicate to the players, easy enough to tell Mason to sit tight to Big Hair or pull the swap with Bentaleb immediately after the first goal and have him get tight to him. Big Hair is an extremely limited technical player and Neville is spot in saying he's next to useless having balls played into his feet away from goal, he shouldn't be that difficult of a player to neutralize in any situation short of aerial duels.

The only other solution would have been for Walker to tighten up closer to Dier and take that space away to run into. That would invite United's wide player further forward but from a wide position. Which is worse a run into the channel between the leftback and the centerback or a run down the touchline? Obviously the run in a more central location and therefore closer to goal is the one to be more concerned with.

In short, the last person to blame in this situation is Dier.",null,0,null,1426593343,null,0,false,0,cphki4j,null,t3_2zbh1w,null,t1_cphki4j,null,t3_2zbh1w,null,null,null,1427807638,null,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2,null

I'll leave the results link up, but take it with a significant pinch of salt. Contact me if you want the raw data, especially if you're interested in picking out the brigaded answers.

Edit 4: Evidence of brigading: 

UKIP responses, 11:48-15:00: 71/781 responses

UKIP responses, 15:00-16:47: 260/758 responses

""Other"" gender, 11:48-15:00: 19/781 responses

""Other"" gender, 15:00-16:47: 42/758 responses

Most of these ""other"" genders were troll responses like ""attack helicopter"".

So I suppose it depends where your fear lives, that decides your perspective and how you frame the argument. 

I think power inevitably corrupts, my hope being, it being spread out over multiple individuals helps minimise that. I place my trust in the wisdom of the crowd, that the bell curve peaks with those who have a natural affinity to seeing our well being as social creatures met. What worries me is that we live in a universe that favours entropy, it's easier to pull something down than build it. An eternal dictatorship as an idea, however beneficial, goes against basic human principles and morality, of which freedom is an important element. If you want to create a perfectly compliant, blissful, oblivious society, live in certainty, then why not partially lobotomise everyone or just altogether eradicate yourselves entirely? Long term, that's also a way of making sure nothing negative ever happens again, but of course that makes you realise how distasteful, ignoble and meaningless holding that kind of objective really is. Reality is messy, democracy is messy, all you can do is have an ideal and work towards falling short of it, as long as we are making meaningful progress and asking questions of ourselves, I think that's all we meat chimps can expect or manage at this stage. 

Long term thinking, critical thinking can be stimulated in a population but needs to be catered for by first providing basic needs and education, which can really only be met through co-operation. Which is why I can see the argument for a temporary benevolent dictator to get a society back on track, but never as an end goal. /waffle",null,0,null,1426593606,null,0,1426594267,0,cphkks2,null,t3_2z9ekz,null,t1_cphkks2,null,t1_cphk34v,null,null,null,1427807671,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

There would be an argument for a more realistic 'benevolent single party' system where leaders can be axed for breaking a pre-decided constitution or losing their shit. I've seen Park Chung-hee, former dictator in Korea been mentioned as a benevolent dictator. He certainly advanced the country economically extremely efficiently, and it's arguable that the people today benefit from his leadership. But he crushed any dissent and was clearly a bastard. 

Similarly in Singapore and China, you can see how it's so easy to get grand projects done with a single party, but the authoritarian rules that go with it are just soul-crushing for a nation. I'm actually pretty libertarian when it comes to the government forcing me to do anything, so I clearly wouldn't support that sort of regime. But then again, economic growth over everything else would never be my priority anyway, so maybe a single party or dictator that I liked would act completely different to these past examples but still get loads of amazing policies and projects through. We could actually do with some sort of incredibly complicated computer programme that can realistically simulate millions of political arrangements (including many we'd never even come up with ourselves) and allow us to see which outcome is genuinely the best for the largest number of people.

To summarize the anti-Platonist response of Popper and Rauch- Nobody, absolutely nobody, should be given final say in an argument, because no individual is capable of infallibility.  Our best hope for progress is to maximize freedom of speech, even though this will *inevitably* result in much bad speech.  (From this perspective, it's a *healthy* sign that we have such lurid tabloid papers.  It means that freedom of speech is still alive.)

null,false,stevemegson,null,null,null,"I'm not sure what you're applying for that requires two signatures, but let's assume that getting a passport would be a big step towards proving your identity anyway, so we need one person who has known you for two years.

The list of acceptable signatories isn't exhaustive, and the guidelines say that ""person of similar standing"" may be ""interpreted in the widest sense"", and pretty much covers anyone who can be shown to have something to lose from a conviction for fraud. Your landlord sounds like a good place to start. If he has a significant portfolio of properties then he may have set up a company, and qualify as a company director. If he has a ""real"" job as well as rental income, let's rule that job out. There's a reasonable chance that someone with enough spare capital to invest in a property to rent out is in the sort of job that qualifies.

If your landlord can't sign, I'd give the Passport Office a call and explain your situation. They may suggest someone you haven't thought of, or be able to offer an alternative to a countersignature. You can't be the first person in this position. If they don't give you any useful answers, contact your MP and ask them to help. The Passport Office has a dedicated department to talk to MPs, and they're likely to be more helpful.

I don't know what the procedure is if you really can't find anyone to sign, but there must be one. It's likely to involve an interview where they ask enough questions to convince them that the person sitting in front of them is you and not an identity thief. I assume they can ask HMRC for details of your tax returns and ask you to confirm some details there. They can check who owns your house and ask you who your landlord is. They can presumably do a credit check and ask about who you have any credit cards or loans with, or your previous addresses.

Well, that *is* the question: ""What is your biological sex?"" The note on chromosomes is just there to add extra clarification that it is not about gender, because a lot of people do not consider there to be any difference between the two. 

Also, ""assigned sex"" is the result of your chromosomes, so I think pretty much everyone knows what their chromosomes are, unless they have an unknown genetic disorder.

&gt;Or better, why is it of interest what body shape we were born with dare I ask? We're not physical here so surely the only interesting question is how we perceive the world, i.e. gender?

Why is it interesting to know any demographic details? Because they are details which impact the way we interact with the rest of society.

The job requires a stay overnight nearby and you can stay at either your budget hotel costing £50 (Scenario A) or a more luxury 5-star experience costing £250 (Scenario B).

* In Scenario A you make a profit of £950.00 and pay £237.50 in tax and end up with £712.50 in your pocket after the job.
* In Scenario B you make a profit of £750.00 and pay £187.50 in tax and end up with £562.50 in your pocket after the job.

You only reduce the amount of tax you pay because you reduce your overall income. In fact you are reducing your income for a net loss of £150.  

&amp;nbsp;  

Bonus Edit: So why would anyone choose Scenario B? Upgrading in this instance is cheaper using pre-tax money than post-tax especially since a business can reclaim the VAT. For the £200 room upgrade it only ends up costing £150 (even less if you have a higher marginal tax rate). The same room upgrade for a consumer (who would also pay VAT) would be £240.

Said with such authority. But it's just wrong. In fact, it's completely off-the-scale wrong.

The reality is that *smokers cost the state far less* as dying of cancer at 50-65 is considerably cheaper than living to 80 and requiring the ongoing medical treatment &amp; pension costs for someone that age. And then they still get cancer or something even more expensive like dementia where full time residential care is required.

This has been studied at length many times, here are some examples:

&gt; Health care costs for smokers at a given age are as much as 40 percent higher than those for nonsmokers, but in a population in which no one smoked the costs would be 7 percent higher among men and 4 percent higher among women than the costs in the current mixed population of smokers and nonsmokers. If all smokers quit, health care costs would be lower at first, but after 15 years they would become higher than at present.


http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199710093371506



&gt; However, non-smokers live longer than smokers. In the USA 78% of male non-smokers are still alive at the age of 70 compared with 57% of smokers. At the age of 80 the figures are 50% and 21%, respectively. Non-smokers thus impose a greater burden on health care resources in old age than their shorter lived fellow question. 

http://thorax.bmj.com/content/53/suppl_2/S38.full.pdf

And that's just healthcare costs, no discussion of state pensions or other old-age benefits. 

If smoking were ""bad for the economy"" it would have been outright banned already. Bottom line: living longer is not ""cheaper"". ",null,0,null,1426596495,null,0,false,0,cphlhsh,null,t3_2zbyo5,null,t1_cphlhsh,null,t1_cphkowz,null,null,null,1427808098,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

So I took my time to decide, as kid it was hard following every game, but I loved watching England play, still do to this day, and saw this player called Michael Owen, and I kinda went nuts about him and decided I would support the team he played for, when I found out it was Liverpool I asked how they were doing in the league and family and friends said they used to win loads but hadn't recently but were still good, also found out the kit was red so I was sold.

* also reform the rent system so people who own more then 10 property must sell off all but 10. this would enable more people to buy there own homes.

* change the house of lord so that each lord is elected. use the proportional representation system to contrast the First past the post of MPs

They're inflexible compared to credit cards, and you don't know how your circumstances may change over time. It's better to do the ""credit card shuffle"" and try to move them to 0% again once the time is up.

It's more important to examine why the debt was built up. What can you change to improve the situation? What are your income and outgoings?

Almost anybody could realistically reduce their outgoings by ~ 10-25% without too much pain (assuming they haven't done a similar exercise recently) and you should be funnelling any spare budget capacity straight onto the cards. Ensure that you're not saving alongside the debts.

His show brings joy to millions. Firing Clarkson is not only depriving many people of their entertainment - it is removing an important voice and opinion maker from being heard.  Something we should be very very wary of in a society which pretends to value free speech.

If it transpires that he did resort to punching someone then of course he should face punishment.  But there must be ways to do that other than dismissal.  

""If I punched someone at my work then I'd be sacked"" I hear you say.  Yes, but you're not Jeremy Clarkson.  You don't say things which interest millions of people.  You're *replaceable*.

OK, sack him if you must.  But at least admit that there's a cost to society.  That it is a loss if someone of Clarkson's ability is removed from doing what he does best.

   I'd like to apologise for discontinuing my project earlier in the season. It turns out you don't get much free time for making wallpapers when you have a newborn baby boy. (I'll admit that the club's struggles with form also had something to do with it too).

However, I received some really great messages in my absence, my boy is 6 months old and sleeping much better, so I'm back and I've got something special planned exclusively for this sub toward the end of the season.

So, here's a couple of bonus wallpapers, one featuring the little magician, and another of our Ricky.

As mentioned in the article the 'loan' to rebuild the hospital was for around £300M, yet the way the PFI is structured will mean that the NHS trust (and thus the taxpayer) will have to pay back over £2.5 BILLION (83x the amount borrowed). They'd have been better off borrowing the money from wonga.com

Of course this doesn't show up as debt on government finance sheets, which makes PFIs a great way of building large infrastructure projects while leaving future governments to sort out the issue of having to pay for them.

Left Yaya out because he can be a huge liability, and we beat Roma and Bayern without him.

Aguero/Dzeko is left open as they're both good at lone striker and have different styles. So depending on the opposition's defensive tactics it's either of them.

No Navas because he's become really quite one-dimensional, and while stretching the back line is a good quality, he's the perfect super sub but starts more games than he should.

This is what non-smokers say. Whereas I, as someone who hasn't drunk for years, say that drinking doesn't provide me with any pleasure. It's different perspectives. If you really think that people don't enjoy smoking then you're being naive. 

I'm not even a smoker and would never dream of smoking normally, but I really like a smoke when I'm out. There is no possible way that I'm addicted and simply relieving a craving. I'd suggest that your first statement is simply incorrect. 

So what if social smokers are a minority?

That's despite alcohol being a contributory factor in criminality...

The National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence reports that alcohol use is a factor in 40 percent of all violent crimes in the United States, including 37 percent of rapes and 27 percent of aggravated assaults. 

More than 17 percent of all people in the United States are binge drinkers, and more than 28 percent of people age 18 to 24.

Binge drinking is more common among people with a household income of at least $75,000. This is a solid middle-class problem.

Let's face it, the gov goes after easy targets like smokers and people on benefits whilst ignoring problems with the middle and upper classes because it might cost them votes / campaign contributions. 

&gt; Most smokers don't seem too bothered though, they claim they don't smoke based on the packaging and it won't make any difference, so what is the problem? 

The problem is that smokers are being unfairly targeted whilst other problems are being ignored. Equality before the law, essentially. Some people like to drink rotten apples, some people like to smoke tobacco.

On that very site, change the graph to start at 1998.  Now, ideally what we want to see is the delta anyway, the rate of change, *the trend is your friend* as they say.

What you notice is it trending down, when following the Tory spending plan, then comes the second election, and boom and bust had been abolished (dunno if you remember this, but it was a slogan of the campaign).  Then what happens, it starts trending the wrong way.  We've got growth in our economy, our GDP is rising, but **our debt has started rising higher**.

Now whilst I agree, it wasn't a ballooning until the bailout, but there is also a big difference between buying shares of Lloyds, which had been forced to acquire a moderately toxic bank, because they have tradable market value, in fact a lot of the debt there is worth something, more than we paid for it after inflation (and QE!).

HL provide guides that recommend funds with reasonable marketing allowances. They also heavily push their own, incredibly expensive, multi-manager funds.

If I can rephrase my point, I think *if* you're going to want information about transgender, intersex and other lives you have to be careful how you ask questions that dissect sex, gender and the sources of those variables.

I don't know what my chromosomes are, but I know what my parents thought my sex was from body shape at birth. It's not true that: 

&gt;Also, ""assigned sex"" is the result of your chromosomes

because plenty of cases exist, surprisingly commonly, where people with one set of chromosomes are raised with the ""opposite"" gender, e.g. AIS women. To simply ask what I was assigned at birth is a question though that I can answer straightforwardly. 

&gt;Why is it interesting to know any demographic details? Because they are details which impact the way we interact with the rest of society. The number of people who are trans is an interesting statistic. Unless you think that being trans has no impact on a person's life, then I think it remains interesting.

I  agree has a strong impact on people's lives: I'm transgender and I appreciate your open attitude. And yes I guess it is of some interest how many others here are.

- writing to them and telling them you dispute the bill they have presented, and do not wish to make payments until that dispute is resolved. Equally they must hold it interest free. You would continue to pay for current usages.

- ask them to provide the documentation of the original agreement and point out where there are mistakes. 

- don't know how this deal is not supposed to be allowed for your mother - but can you demonstrate that you provided the information to them and they failed to interpret it properly - therefore you were reasonable to assume it was all legitimate.

- at the very least start bargaining with them to lower the bill and lower the repayments.  e.g. point out that they would have had all the info required, so you don't feel its your fault, offer half the money paid over 5 years and see where that gets you.

My family has had a few computers from them, and when there has been a problem, they have gotten it sorted out quickly and efficiently. They never tried to BS us, or charge us for something that was covered by warranty.

In terms of what to buy, my rule of thumb is that you should either buy cheap or expensive laptops and never one that is mid range. The reasoning is that if you buy a laptop for £300, it will work just fine for browsing the web, light gaming (very light) and watching stuff on Netflix. Additionally, as it's only £300, it doesn't really matter too much if it only lasts three years.

If you want something that you will use for several years, then go something higher end. Maybe a Mac (if you like MacOS) or something like a higher end Dell XPS that should last a fair while longer.

Finally, as an alternative I would like to suggest a Microsoft Surface Pro 3 (with keyboard cover). Since I got mine in December, I've not used my laptop at all, and I no longer want to get an iPad.

null,false,Erasmus_Microman,null,null,null,"Pensions vs ISAs is complicated. I'm not an expert, but here are some of the factors to consider:

* You may get an employer match on contributions.

* Pensions cannot be accessed until a certain future date, so may not be the right option if you might want a house deposit or something before retirement.

* Pensions are subject to a lifetime limit - if you hit that limit early (particularly with 20% marginally taxed money) you may impair your ability to take advantage of employer contribution matching and making contributions before higher rates of tax (40%+) in the future.

* The government can change the pensions rules at any time, including the lifetime limit level - in an extreme case they could raid/nationalise pension pots (this has happened in other countries, though I think it's fairly unlikely in the UK). Since you can't withdraw the assets before retirement there's not much you can do to protect yourself against this if the political winds change.

* Pensions are (currently) not counted for working-age benefits purposes (I think), so may be a way of preserving retirement savings through a period of unemployment or ill health.

* Pensions are somewhat resistant to creditors/bankruptcy (may depend on the situation).

* There are reciprocal agreements with some other countries that may enable you to take the tax benefits of a pension with you if you emigrate. (ISAs are more specifically British.)

* New rules around inheritance tax mean that pensions may be an IHT-efficient way of leaving a legacy.

* In many scenarios the tax savings of pensions may outweigh the tax savings of ISAs (particularly given the 25% tax-free lump sum).

As you can imagine, the decision can be complicated. Many people choose to contribute enough to take any employer match, but otherwise to focus on ISA savings earlier in their career (before 40% tax) and so they can use it towards a house, and pensions later in their career, when they're likely to be paying higher rates of tax and the time to retirement is shorter so there's less risk of political changes.

They'll get a monthly feed from the credit report agencies on your other accounts, but all they'll see is that you have another current account with an overdraft on it. They wouldn't have any definitive information telling them the other account is a student account.

Having said that, the terms of student accounts usually say that the bank can demand repayment of the overdraft at any time for any reason, so perhaps a mere suggestion that you might be in breach of the terms from their credit feeds would be enough for them. I've never heard of it happening, though, and I know a few friends who have two student overdrafts at different banks.

OP - Which bank are you with? If you don't want to take the slim-ish risk that the banks will shut down your accounts then you might be able to switch to a different bank which offers a bigger interest free overdraft.

I'll likely be down by the Donut for 9am, **it looks to be between 8-11am and peaking around 9:30am**. If anybody wants in for a safe look then I can bring the extra stuff to share as none of my friends are interested in A:astronomy B:early morning adventures. I am working on Friday so I can't stay for the entire duration. I can maybe leave the glasses and someone can walk them to my work in the lanes afterwards.

It's probably best not to ask about genitals in your third question in a questionnaire I agree! But a question about genitals would be a different question again from one about chromosomes. You can be XY and have a vagina.

If you are interested in such information as a transgender person my advice for the next questionnaire which I think might cover all the variance you mention would be:

Sex assigned at birth: male/female/other
Gender: male/female/other

unless, as you say you wanted to include a very long list of gender expressions which would include agender, bigender etc.

The principle is as fair as it can get. You're taking money from someone who can't use it any more.

&gt;it isnt proportional

Don't know what this is supposed to mean but it is proportional. There's a tax exempt amount above which the tax applies. If you transfer the inheritance before death then as long as you do it soon enough, the tax reduces to zero.

&gt;it frequently catches good citizens out when their circumstances change

It doesn't 'catch' anyone. It's not a punishment. It's a tax. VAT and income tax catches lots of 'good' citizens, that doesn't mean they aren't working appropriately. And the 'change' you're talking about is them suddenly becoming rich. Which I assume relates to your 'proportional' argument as well. If you have a million pounds, I don't care if you live in the south east or inner London, you still have a million pounds.

In fact it's utterly fucking bizarre that people are complaining that the inheritance tax unfairly affects people who live in houses that have gained substantially in value.

Here is the relevant bit:

&gt; Internationally, **PFI** **contracts** **are** **generally** **off-balance-sheet**, **meaning** **that** **they** **do** **not** **show** **up** **as** **part** **of** **the** **national** **debt**. This fiscal technicality can be convenient for governments. In his paper on PFI in Spain, José Francisco Bellod Redondo notes that one of the main drivers for PFI in Spain is compliance with the fiscal restrictions imposed under the Maastricht Treaty and Stability and Growth Pact, which set concrete limits to the national debt.[61]
&gt;
&gt; **In** **the** **UK**, the technical reason why **PFI** **debts** **are** **off**-**balance**-**sheet** is that the government authority taking out the PFI theoretically transfers one or more of the following risks to the private sector: risk associated with demand for the facility (e.g. under-utilisation); risk associated with construction of the facility (e.g. overspend and delay); or risk associated with the 'availability' of the facility. The PFI contract bundles the payment to the private sector as a single ('unitary') charge for both the initial capital spend and the ongoing maintenance and operation costs. Because of supposed risk transfer, the entire contract is deemed to be revenue rather than capital spending.

I wouldn't even mind if they actually used common sense in setting speed limits nationally but they don't. It seems totally random and not at all based upon the road or conditions.

There are dual carriageways near me that go down to 30mph and have speed cameras, which inevitibly means that twats slow down to 20mph and traffic bunches up and crawls to a halt.

The road is easily capable of 50-60 like most dual carriageways and in fact when I first started to drive it was a 60mph road which has since been cut right down.

If you have flats above or below you, being able to hear through to them can be a nightmare (especially creaky floorboards). 

Area, transport, shops and entertainment (pubs etc) are key for me. If you live in a shitty house and are in the middle of nowhere and can't escape then that makes it ten times worse. I survived in a place which literally had mushrooms growing in the shower just because it was a great area to live.

Exactly.  But in this case, it's designed to sell a product that kills a large proportion of it's users, and I say that as an occasional smoker. 

&gt;Has a study ever been conducted on alcohol packaging affecting drinking, especially in younger people? Has it been used to suggest plain packaging? Of course not, because people like drinking too much to even consider that.

I'd be surprised if a comparative study had never been done, but I can't find a study with those primary outcomes on Pubmed or Google Scholar.  I wouldn't argue against plain alcohol packaging at all - I think it would a very effective measure to reduce drinking rates.  It definitely hasn't been propositioned because it wouldn't work, but because 1) cultural attitudes to smoking are now so  negative, relative to alcohol, which is so revered that we are, along with Finland, the only country in Europe with rising liver mortality, and 2) the alcohol industry lobbies are extremely powerful and are hugely protected by an ingrained alcohol culture.

&gt;No people need to be patronised at every turn to discourage them, apparently.

Smokers are only being discouraged from a position of persuasion to consume caused by the contribution of marketing (in the case of plain packaging).  To say smokers are being patronised implies an immunity as a whole from the effects of cigarette packaging - the existence of designed packaging, ever evolving, is testament to its power.
