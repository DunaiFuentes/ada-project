null,false,[deleted],null,null,null,"Yes it is. I went through this application process recently with my husband (I'm British, he's an American expat, we successfully applied for his visa in November). The Â£18,600 is actually the couple's combined income within the UK - so if e.g. OP manages to move there on a work or student visa and later applies for a partner visa, any income he's making at that time will count towards it too. But in the very least, I believe his girlfriend will have to be earning a salary over that threshold for at least 6 months before he could get a spouse visa, even if they are already married when she moves back. Alternatively, if he goes on a student or work visa and they live together unmarried for two years, they would be able to apply for a non-spouse partner visa. From what I remember the financial and other requirements are pretty much the same, you just have to prove that you've been cohabiting for two years instead of proving you are married.

In my case, we both provided proof of income using bank statements and payslips; my husband provided 6 months' worth whereas I actually had to provide 12 months' worth. The reason is because I'm a full-time student and my income is in the form of an untaxed stipend, not technically a ""salary"", so it was categorised as ""other type of income"" which requires 12 months' worth of evidence.

-Well he did come out of the Sporting academy as one of their brightest talents they have had in a while. He has also been looked as a much brighter talent than the guy Tottenham bought this summer, who have been pretty decent so far. 

-Coates have been in this club for nearly 5 years, he has had one serious injury that did sadly remove almost one season. In that period he is played 15-20 games for Liverpool, not really a lot of games. He did play quite decent in the preseason, but he sadly canÂ´t even get close to the starting lineup for Sunderland and when you are not good enough for Sunderland then he is not going to be good enough for us. 

Another problem is his injuries, he is extremely injury prone. Do we really need more injury prone players?

His future position is as a CB, he plays at RB at this stage in his career as it helps developing the guy and gives him experience.

Allen and Lucas play in a very niche role that, as shown by Henderson and Gerrard's struggles when asked to do the same, isn't analogous to the role Hendo is in at the moment. Allen is there to provide a reliable pivot moving forward and is expected and instructed specifically not to take unnecessary risks in attempting long piercing balls (Gerrard) or bombing forward to join the attack (Hendo) but instead to recycle possession in order to facilitate other more creative members of the side. I hear all the time people asking why would we have someone in the side merely to facilitate, and whilst that is already massively unfair to Allen since he does offer much more, it is absolutely vital to our style of play. He is an excellent presser. He does the simple things marvellously well (easy said than done, just look at Gerrard and Henderson when they are asked to play the Allen/Lucas role). He is very intelligent footballer who reads the game well and has very good technique, movement, pace (for his position) and agility. He wins the balls back more times than most realize through reading the play and intercepting or literally poking the ball away from a opposition player (hard to describe, but if you've seen it you'll appreciate it - there aren't many i've seen who do this quite as effectively as Allen) but his defensive contribution is often judged purely on specific short-comings like his vulnerability when an opposition player is allowed a free run at him or in a physical battle.


I think he's a great player in the right system. Yes, he has short-comings, but so do many. I'm sure I'll be mauled for saying this but I actually prefer him to Lucas in this role. Lucas offers more of a shield defensively in most situations, but with our dynamic back three and their license to press high we don't need a 'natural' DM, as long as we have two deeper midfielders to share any defensive responsibilities and also offer more in other areas.",null,0,null,1424512001,null,0,false,0,cosdnn6,null,t3_2wkf4x,null,t1_cosdnn6,null,t1_cosc0nl,null,null,null,1424710601,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

I'm with Sky and I find them very good and customer service is excellent too. They also offer fibre optic broadband. As with anything your mileage may vary and who is the best is subjective. What's good for me isn't good for someone else. But no throttling is the main reason I'm with them. 

If you're going to get Sky TV now or in the future, get Sky Broadband. Sam Knows and similar websites will also help find your distance from the telephone exchange so calculate speeds. I'm 1.1km from the Solihull Exchange and no problems.

null,false,bull0x,gold,xyzzy,null,"My best Bristol day:

* Take a stroll through Clifton, along York Crescent. Enjoy the view, you'll be down there later. 
* Head up to the right of the suspension bridge. For a couple of quid, head up the observatory to the camera obscura (best on a sunny day). Spend some time looking at the bridge and people watching. For another couple of quid head down the Giant's Cave, watch your head and come out on the side of the gorge. 
* Sliiiide back down to the bridge, over rock worn smooth by millions of bums. Watch your phone, if it's in your pocket. 
* Across the bridge, taking in the views, to the new visitor centre (haven't been there since the new one opened but the old one in the portacabin was cool enough, all the alternative designs for the bridge on display. 
* Optional extension: up North Road, take a wander around Leigh Woods. Some cool stuff in there - often art projects, an old hill fort, some cool views. 
* Brave optional extension: find Burwalls Cave on the other side of Bridge Road. 
* Then head into Ashton Court, through the big gatehouse. Always thought it'd be cool to live in there. 
* Wander down through the park. Optional: there's a cafe up to the right, with a bike hire place and a golf course - both cost, the golf is something like Â£6 and bike hire is [a tenner an hour](http://www.pedalprogression.com/bike-hire/). Neither is essential to making this a great day. 
* Keep wandering downhill. Past the Domesday Oak, past the weird stone head, past the deer park, to the mansion. Never been inside, but there's another nice cafe round the back. 
* Keep heading downhill from the mansion, past the UWE art school. Straight over at the end of the road, along the footpath next to the cricket ground. Look back up at the bridge - you were all the way up there!
* Left at the end of the cricket ground, takes you past some cool allotments. One of them had a goat in it for a while, not sure if she's still there. 
* Under the flyover, across Girder Bridge. You'll know it when you see it.  
* The big red brick building is the Create Centre. Been meaning to find out what it is for a while. There's a cool looking eco house at the bottom. 
* Round to the right, a short distance along Cumberland Road, then a quick left down an alley towards the big chimney takes you through Underfall Yard, a cool little boat yard. 
* You're now at the Harbourmaster's. Often lots of cool stuff happening at the slip - kids learning to sail, paddle boarding, rowing. Nice to watch for a while. 
* Stroll along the harbourside. A nice little pub on the right (The Cottage?). Keep following the Harbourside Walk signs, there's a short detour around he back of another boat yard, coming out next to the SS Great Britain.
* Another optional expense - the SSGB tickets look quite pricey but give you a while year's access. Very cool museum, worth a look if you can. 
* Continue along the harbourside. If you've held out his long you're probably quite hungry. Definitely worth the wait is Brunel's Buttery - massive greasy bacon and egg baps for not a lot of money. 
* Keep going - MShed is free and worth a look. Nice views from the balconies at the top. The cranes outside are awesome too - sometimes they move them and do tours. 
* Cross the river to the Arnolfini, often cool exhibitions here. 
* Over Perrot's bridge (the horny one), to Millennium Square. Nice place to chill and look at the fountains. The lights on the ground are a shape called an analemma - tracing out the shape that the midday sun makes throughout the year, from the shadow cast by the weird spine thing. The whole square is a sundial!
* From here I sometimes head back along this side of the harbour - Lloyds Amphitheatre, a cool floating garden, nice boats; or towards the centre where there's plenty more to see. The old city, Corn Street through to Castle Park, whatever. 

Wow, long list. No money needed - bring a sandwich or three and skip the optional bits. Could do the walk in an hour or two, or spend the whole day and more on it. Whenever I have a new visitor/CouchSurfer who wants to see Bristol, this is what I do if I have time. 

Enjoy!

Could AVB have done better with the right backing and a free hand in the transfer market? Was Tim Sherwood's win percentage a fluke or is he actually the great manager he makes himself out to be?

Personally I like AVB, I think he's a good guy who wasn't quite ready for the Spurs job but will one day make a great manager. I think Redknapp is overally interested in blowing his own trumpet and I find the way he treated the England rumours unforgivable really. And Sherwood...

For example, Scots, Welsh, Basques, Kurds, Tamils, Inuits, Maori people and the like. 

In the former as you say Mo Farah is rightly considered British. In the latter the overwhelming majority of people consider him to be British, but there is no real strict set of criteria or definitions by which it can be objectively measured. For example, an illegal immigrant might not have the passport but would have lived here for a long period of time and people might consider him British. Self-identified Irish people might have picked up a British passport for convienience and wouldn't be considered by themselves, their friends or family to be British. An economic migrant might use a grandfather clause to work in Britain but not like the country. Someone might hate the country, forsake it entirely, and go and join a terrorist group plotting to destroy us all, and people might think that having a distinction between the two might be useful.

Personally I think anyone who considers themselves British should be considered British by others if they meet the first definition of citizenship or have logical reasons why they don't.

Lowering prices won't do anything to help - it'll just make it cheaper for tourists to grab tickets to the game, give more profit to touts, and it won't let people go easily as groups because it'll just be an even bigger lottery for who gets to go every week. There needs to be a better way of giving tickets to the people who want to go almost every week. The club need to do better than to jump straight from ""Went to 12 games last season"" to General Sale. Because right now you're either going almost every single week every single year, or you're scrapping for tickets with people who have never necessarily been to Anfield before in their life. Even then, you're still not going to sort out all the people who *do* go to the game every week to just bitch and moan about how shite we are and will only ever bother to sing when we're on the verge of winning the title. 

Either way, glad to see an argument against the Wools vs Scousers point of view, because it's nonsense. I grew up in Maghull/Ormskirk, so technically a wool (though still pretty local by Reddit standards), but my Dad has had a season ticket for 30 years now. I knew all the words to Scouser Tommy and YNWA before I was five years old (aside from a few misheard words at least). I've sat next to season ticket holders at Anfield who travelled all the way from *Belgium* every other weekend to be at the game, and they were as knowledgeable and vociferous as they come. Where you're from and live makes no difference to your ability to cheer on the team - it's whether you're at the game to cheer on the team or at the game to just grab the experience for yourself.

There's quite honestly not a whole lot to do, culturally, in Brecon. The Museum is closed for refurbishment (although the Barracks museum is open); and its *very* limited in terms of shops.

It's pretty great for walking though, I'd recommend walks up Pen-y-Van, which is the tallest of the Brecon Beacons, and should take a full day. I walked up it a few years ago, in April, and it was bloody cold; so be prepared for variable and changing weather. A really amazing, if strenuous walk, is from Brecon following the A470 through rough farmland (along paths) right up to Storey Arms Outdoor Education Centre (which is the starting point for a walk up Pen-Y-Van). 

Also recommend the National Park Visitor Centre.. which, although the actual Centre itself is shit, has some lovely gentle walks along Mynydd Illtud.

Another interesting walk is along the monks gardens, just outside the Cathedral. 

If you like books, take a trip to Hay-on-Wye, about 45 minutes away by bus. It's the bookshop capital of the UK.

If so then by your logic you should not buy much at all without having about 3 months' worth of living expenses (a good rule of thumb) stored away in savings. As it is, this amount of accessible savings is a good idea.

So taking the scenario where you spend nothing above bare subsistence until you have 3 months' worth of living expenses tucked away, you would use your credit card, *for free*, to pay for as much of your subsistence outgoings as possible so you gained the protections outlined previously. It also helps build credit rating.

When the money is there, you do not have to worry so much. It still makes total sense to use a credit card *for free* to gain the protections.

It is sensible to budget for things carefully and very helpful to time purchases so that you know two large outgoings will leave your account a month apart.

There is not a great deal of difference at the end of it with your ""save up until you have the cash"" approach.

For atmosphere it's those that want to experience Anfield vs those that want to support Liverpool. Many Scousers won't support the team and won't generate at atmosphere, while many wools will sing every song and kick every ball, scream their heart out and generate a lot for the atmosphere.

But then there's also wools that just want to get a picture with their back to the play holding a half-and-half scarf. And there's also a large amount of Scousers who create the atmosphere we love.

1) it's fraud if you do it with the intention of avoiding debts so don't do it solely with that intention (also they'd have to prove htat was your sole intention which is impossible so don't really worry about this)

2) change name via deed poll (even a tiny change such as from John Smith to Jonathan Smith is fine, no one will ever know you've changed names) and apply for a new driving licence for Â£35

3) move house. DO NOT change any bills or anything to your new address, never ever link it in any way via any company. Your phone bill, start a new one, same for cable tv etc etc. do not ever put down your previous address on any forms. Go to natwest or RBS or Lloyds and open a basic bank account with a debit card.

4) if anyone asks, you've been abroad for the last 3 years - hence no credit history under your new name.

5) you now have a clean slate, get one of the basic Â£10 a month sim card only phone plans, pay it for 3 months, then apply for a bad credit credit card. Pay that on time for 3 months, you will now qualify for decent credit cards and have ok-ish credit.

If you're under 30, check out [Prince's Trust](http://www.princes-trust.org.uk) for any mentoring or courses available. Also check out [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com) for any gathering that tickles your interests be it self-employment, franchise, startup, etsy selling, crowdfunding etc. Your local council might offer free training/mentoring available as well.

As for online courses, there are so many to choose from but it really depends on what you want to do. I originally listed more courses in this post but it's probably better to suggest a couple of courses that are less theoretical and more practical. You might get addicted to collecting certificates instead of actually doing something! Check out Steve Blank's [How to Build a Startup](https://www.udacity.com/course/ep245), and Entrepreneurship [101](https://www.edx.org/course/entrepreneurship-101-who-customer-mitx-15-390-1x)/[102](https://www.edx.org/course/entrepreneurship-102-what-can-you-do-mitx-15-390-2x) on edX.

The inspectors can do some sneaky things, like pretending to be a neighbour and asking if your TV reception is having problems. If you say 'our tv is working fine' then they will likely be able to take you to court on that. Having an antenna certainly isn't enough evidence because nobody goes up on the roof to dismantle their antenna just because they don't have a TV.

They are sneaky fuckers who work on commission and won't do everything by the book, you can't really count on magistrates to be sympathetic if they go to court either.

null,false,bitmia,null,null,null,"Hey everybody,

There is a ton of gambling sites in the Bitcoin world but not a single provably fair lottery backed by established members of this community. Having said that, [yours truly](http://bitcoin-otc.com/viewgpg.php?nick=only) and [genericpersona](http://bitcoin-otc.com/viewgpg.php?nick=genericpersona) are proud to announce the launch of [Bitmia](https://bitmia.com).

We've made the number generation provably fair and we timestamp all purchases cryptographically. It is about as fair and transparent as a lottery can ever get.

We only have a single daily drawing so far (every 144 blocks) and it involves guessing the 3 rightmost hex digits in an upcoming block's hash in any order which gives you 1 in 816 odds of winning.

What sets Bitmia apart from the instant dice sites is the fact that it has the ability and will eventually become a positive expected value game. We're actually flirting with the idea of tying the ticket price to the jackpot in a way that its EV (expected value) is at all times positive, no matter how big or small the jackpot is. Given the fact that the game ""resets"" itself every day, my gut tells me that we should have enough time to fill the ""booster fund"" for whenever the jackpot is won (that is unless a heck load of tickets are sold every day). Feedback on this idea is very welcome.

We're in the process of adding more ELI5 FAQ's, so I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have :)

It started in the Lower Anfield Road end with the fans directly adjacent to the Besiktas fans.  I was one of the fans in this area.  While it's true that the majority of their fans were a credit to their team, there were a set of their fans whose only interest was intimidating and threatening our fans.  They faced us for the majority of the match, staring down our support, making threatening gestures, screaming insults at us.  Extra security was sent up to the area.  Some people with children moved away.  It was a more charged atmosphere than a regular Premier League game but no one really gave a shit.  Some of our fans returned the middle fingers and reciprocated the stare downs and puffed their chests out right back.  After we scored and celebrated their fans started throwing things at us.  Coins, plastic bottles filled with liquid and a lit cigarette stub (I only saw one of these but there might have been more).  The song was a response to this.  I'm not judging whether it was a good response or not I'm just saying that this is what it was borne out of.

He's shown leadership on the pitch at Liverpool too so there's definitely merit for him to become Liverpool skipper. 

Moreso than Sakho I'd say, who just has pedigree behind him. Lallana was the long term captain at Saints too, but he's not in the conversation because he hasn't shown the level of leadership that Skrtel and Hendo have. I think the same should be said of Sakho.

Plus if we're talking skill level I'd say Skrtel has done really well in this three back formation - hasn't had the highs of Sakho's performances but hasn't had the lows either; he's been really solid. Also he's been at the club much longer than any of our players apart from Lucas.

Whenever the opposing team starts singing the Gerrard song and its not immediately drowned out I die a little in side. This is not the Anfield I remember.

&gt; After Mario Balotelli had slotted his unnecessarily âcontroversialâ penalty, a section of attendees belted out one of the most cringe worthy of generic football songs: âYouâre not singing anymore.â
Itâs a small-time chant that has regularly been mocked by Liverpool fans. And here it was, loud and proud within the confines of our ground.

&gt; No matter that Besiktas had been followed 2,000 miles by what was probably the most vocal set of away supporters Anfield has witnessed this season. No matter that these fans had (literally) lit up Liverpool with songs, flags and flares earlier in the day. No matter that there was little evidence of the famous Anfield atmosphere for a European night coming from the Liverpool fans for most of the evening.

A good parallel to draw is with Al Murray.

Dapper Laughs and Dan O'Reilly are, to some extent, the same person. Laughs comes across as nothing more than an extension of O'Reilly's actual personality. Perhaps that's unfair to O'Reilly, as no one besides those close to him really know what he's like.

Thing is, the likes of Al Murray go to great pains to distance themselves. They'll state that fans agreeing with the jokes is not the point of the character. O'Reilly didn't do this until he started copping flack, and even now he only sort of discourages his fans behaviour in a way that comes across as PR rather than a genuine worry that people will conflate him and his character.

It's got nothing to do with feminists or social justice warriors (which, by the way is a fucking ridiculous thing to rally against: wanting life to be nicer for everyone, how could you possibly be against that?), and everything to do with basic human decency.

&gt;In 2000, David Cameron (at that time an unelected Conservative party member) repeatedly attacked the Labour government's plans to abolish Section 28, publicly criticising then-Prime Minister Tony Blair as being ""anti-family"" and accused him of wanting the ""promotion of homosexuality in schools"".[50] In 2003, once Cameron had been elected as Conservative MP for Witney, he continued to support Section 28 including by voting against the repeal of section 28 in this year.[51] As the Labour government were determined to remove Section 28 from law, Cameron voted in favour of a Conservative amendment that retained certain aspects of the clause, which gay rights campaigners described as ""Section 28 by the back door"".[52] This was unsuccessful, and Section 28 was repealed by the Labour government without concession (Cameron was absent for the vote on its eventual repeal). However, in June 2009, Cameronâthen leader of the Conservative Party whilst campaigning to be the next Prime Ministerâformally apologised for his party introducing the law, stating that it was a mistake and had been offensive to gay people.[53] He restated this belief in January 2010 and proposed to alter the policy of the Conservative Party to reflect his belief that equality should be taught in British schools[54] though he has yet to further this proposal since he became Prime Minister in May 2010.[citation needed]",null,0,null,1424530945,null,0,false,0,coshu6k,null,t3_2wk1pw,null,t1_coshu6k,null,t1_cos3gsx,null,null,null,1424712553,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

&gt;Can they enter my house for an inspection?

No. As with Bailiffs, they have no legal right of entry. Now a bailiff can enter through an open door / window - I've never looked into if that applies to Capita staff; I'd imagine it doesn't. If they deem it appropriate to gain entry and you refuse, they can request assistance from the police. This won't happen.

&gt;If I refuse entry, can they walk around my garden and look in my windows, even after I ask them to leave?

Technically, yes. They can look in through front windows; if access to the garden is via a gate the same rules apply as with the first question - if it's locked, they're not allowed to do so, if it's open they can.

&gt;Can they get a warrant to see my house even if there is no indication that I own a TV? (No cable/satellite subscription, no antennas)

Yes. There's more chances of every channel on every subscription network having something brilliant to watch, simultaneously, than this ever happening.

&gt;Can they summon me to court when they don't even seem to know our names?

No.

&gt;Can they summon me to court without evidence that we own a TV?

No. Also you can own as much equipment capable of receiving TV signals / programmes as you want - it's the usage of that equipment that necessitates a licence. - tl;dr: If it's not plugged into an aerial / cable box / satellite, you don't need a licence. A phone / tablet / PC etc? If you use it to watch live content you need a licence. Use it for catch-up / on demand? No licence required.

I've split the following question into two separate parts:

&gt;Am I required to go to court or defend myself in court when I have committed no offense and there can be no proof that I committed an offense (since I didn't do it)?

No, because you won't be summoned to court.

&gt;...Surely we are presumed innocent until there is at least some evidence to the contrary?

Not when it comes to TV licences. The people charged with collecting the licence fee operate on the assumption that every house in the country uses equipment to watch / record programming, and as such - idiots that they are - they will automatically infer guilt if you don't have a licence.

A swift letter to them will stop this.

This is an issue where cross-department meetings ARE needed. Rogue landlords tend to be pissing off a lot of government departments with what they do, it's in the governments interest to work together to bring these people down. 

Do you think these rogue landlords are declaring their income to the taxman, for example? Of course not, they take the rent in cash. Do you think they pay Council Tax on the properties that they're renting? Of course not, and they usually don't inform the authority who is living there either. Why is the government not taking a bigger interest in chasing these people down? They should be cooperating with the police, not just writing letters.

A few of my favourites are Maybelline Superstay 24 Hour and Barry M. Maybelline is a little more expensive but they really do last all day. Superdrug normally has a 3 for 2 offer on Maybelline stuff, and they do a nice mix of bright and more subtle colours.

Forever Heather is my favourite everyday look and Creme Caramel is my MLBB. They also have some lovely purple and plum colours which I think would look lovely as more bold colours with your complexion and hair. They smell really good and the balms that come with them are really moisturising.

Barry M is a bit cheaper, but their lipsticks are really nice for ~Â£4 a pop, they don't bleed and glide on very nicely without being drying or patchy. I only have shade 164-Everything's Rosie and it's become my new go-to everyday colour, it lasts a good 2-3 hours and doesn't make an ugly faded halo around my lips like some colours do.

Gabby was awol, 

vlaar cannot play with Clark at all and he looks like a sulking spoilt brat at the moment, 

Gil is to weak to play against a team like Stoke, 

huttons is infuriating some of the plays he makes are top quality but sometime he shits the bed and his delivery into the box is poor, 

benteke gets screwed over by the players around him when he's going to knock the ball on no one is on the toes and looking for the knock on they react when they should just act, and benteke isn't faultless either he had a poor day but he gets no help, 

Delph and Sanchez both played shit gave the ball away to much dozed off at times, are unable to link up to attack or defence, 

Andi was pretty poor but I don't think he should have come on for Gil, I don't like when he plays with gabby in the same team, and I'd put him ahead of gabby any day. 

Ally doesn't set the world on fire but he seems to put in decent shifts but like Hutton has a poor delivery into the box.

Every party has these, and using a sample of 20-odd people that have emerged (and been ejected form the party) to generalise and tar a party with 40,000-odd members and millions of supporters is idiotic. It would be like calling the Labour Party the paedophile protection party due to their actions in Rotherham over the last few decades.

There are problems that no one nation, I don't care how powerful they might be will be able to tackle alone. For example climate change, international Islamic terrorism, how are we going to provide energy when the oil runs out, how do we deal with feeding everyone, what happens during a world virus outbreak? We still have the capability of nuke ourselves out of existence, how do we go about exploring space? How do we get goods from one part of the world to another? What do we do when computers start to put more and more people out of the work place?

""We need to ensure that whatever level of the game we are playing at we have everyone working as a team and once we got the penalty he stops working.

""So he needs to improve on that facet of his game to play in his position, rather than standing on the side of the football field.""

Rodgers, speaking to national newspapers, said of Balotelli: ""He has contributed against Besiktas, he has got the penalty and scored the goal but that is what he is paid to do.

""He needs to keep that efficiency in his game and show that he can affect the team whether he is asked to play from the bench or from the start. In a different country and a different style of football that (goal) would be all that matters but in this team there is more to it than that.""

â¢	Requiring that when somebody is killed by the state there must be a proper independent investigation, and that armed personnel should be trained properly (McCann et al v UK)

â¢	Preventing the government informing paramilitaries they know will kill someone of that individual's location, to execute by proxy (Shaghan v UK)

â¢	You can't put an ethnic individual in a cell with a racist offender and take bets on how long he'll last (he died) (R on the application of Amin v SSHD)

â¢	It led to safeguards and legal standards for wiretapping (Malone v UK)

â¢	You can't ""interrogate"" prisoners by forcing them into certain positions or depriving them of light and sound (Ireland v UK)

â¢	The legalisation of homosexuality in Northern Ireland (Dudgeon v UK)

â¢	Stopping contempt of court from infringing on freedom of the press (Sunday Times v UK)

â¢	The mentally ill who voluntarily commit themselves to an institution are owed the same duty - suicide watch etc - as those who are sectioned (Rabone v Pennine Care)

â¢	Ensuring that existing prisoners still get access to solicitors (Golder v UK)

â¢	Ensuring that workers maintain rights to join trade unions (Wilson v UK)

â¢	Giving the police an obligation to act if somebody is being dangerously stalked (Osman v UK)

â¢	Preventing indefinite detention under the declaration of a national emergency (A v SOS for the Home Dept)

â¢	Preventing public birching of children by the police in the Isle of Man (Tyrer v UK)

â¢	Retention of DNA &amp; fingerprint data by the state must have limitations (S &amp; Marper vs UK)

Why? Because you said so?

&gt;You can argue all day but no other party has has such a close affiliation with racism and bigotry.

That's ignoring of course the fact that Labour have sitting councillors that have defected to them from the BNP, whereas UKIP bans those types of people form even becoming members. No other party has such a close affiliation with child abuse than Labour after Rotherham. I guess Labour *are* the paedophie protection party then.

&gt;I'd wager many of their supporters are bigots too.

Based on nothing but (ironically) your own bigoted views of people based on a tiny sample of people who have said stupid things and been kicked out of the party. 

&gt;It's why you see more UKIP support in the areas with the least cultural diversity.

Sure, nothing to do with the fact that places with more immigrants would have a lower UKIP vote due to immigrants not voting for a party they view as anti-immigration.

&gt;Also the EU is not responsible, in any part, for the conflict in Ukraine. Seriously where do you get this nonsense from?

I think you'll find it is. There was a House of Lords EU Commission report out yesterday that stated that the EU hadn't gauged how Russia would react to the EU expanding up to its border and into it's sphere of influence. Russia wants a buffer zone between it and the EU/NATO, and the EU cut into that when it opened itself up to Ukraine becoming a member. It's expansionist attitude has lead to Ukraine becoming a war zone.

Eh, I guess it depends. The ones you mentioned, along with Benzema (I think he's the perfect ""second striker"" nowadays) do have the ability to bring others into the game, but look at your Ibras, your Lewandoskis, your Diego Costas- the three of them are steamrolling, bullying types of strikers who do depend on service, but can compensate for it by being able to hold on to the ball and of course goals. 

I think it'd be crazy to classify Kane in one of the two categories, because he does have the strength of the ones I mentioned along with the ability to bring others into the game that Ibra or Diego Costa don't have (Chelsea first goal is a great example of his holdup play and selfishness when needed, and then there was the Sheff United assist to Eriksen), so the analysis falls just a bit short because it ignores another dimension of Kane's play.

On average I think I pay somewhere Â£100-Â£150 for frames, but if you're after designer frames then it's probably more like Â£200-Â£250. Basically, your choice of frame can be a large factor in the cost. 

Then also... the additional bits, if you need thinner lenses, or whatever else. 

If you just want new lenses in those frames then that will cut out a fair chunk of your costs. I couldn't find any frames I liked one year so I just gave them my old pair and asked them to fit the lenses in. The only issue is you'll be without your current pair for a week or so. Can't remember how much that cost me, but maybe in total closer to Â£100 (that's with additional lens thinning which was about half of that).

I left in disgust when they abandoned principle at the first opportunity by supporting the public funding of political parties. This hadn't been a Green policy, they had previously (rightly) denounced big money and dodgy donors, and called for reform to level the playing field. But as soon as the Labour-commissioned Hayden Philips report came up with a solution that went beyond levelling the playing field and effectively offered them a public subsidy simply for being a political party, they embraced it. It was difficult not to see that as a political calculation in the interest of the party and not the voter.

No party has a monopoly in virtue. All of them are likely to make ugly political compromises at some point.

Of course, it is much easier to find top no.10s these day then good examples of the type of no.9 that I feel would suit Kane.  Also, there is no immediate *need* to play Kane at no.10.

6) ""... lots are sold in their actual state with all faults, imperfections or errors of description"" - i.e. if the item turns out not to work, or is not as described, tough luck.

18) ""Purchasers shall pay for and remove lots at their own risk and expense ... the Auctioneers reserve the right to scrap, or to resell uncollected lots with no refund ... they shall be subject to a daily charge per lot to cover storage, loading, transport, etc. and where applicable, interest on outstanding accounts will be levied at 4% above Barclays Bank Minimum Lending Rate."" - i.e. you have to collect the item yourself and they will charge you for every day you leave it there, with interest charged.

Oh and if you win that pallet of 37 servers, be aware none of them will have hard drives, so you have quite an expense left to pay to get them working, assuming that they are working machines anyway of which there is no guarantee.

&gt;""The UK Independence Party, commonly known as UKIP (/ËjuËkÉªp/), is a Eurosceptic[10][11] and right-wing populist[4] political party in the United Kingdom.""
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Independence_Party

I know Wikipedia isn't an academic source but it will do for this. I suggest you read the entire page actually. 

&gt;UKIP bans those types of people form even becoming members.

UKIP is the only party that has had to ban EDL and BNP supporters from joining, because as a party it appeals to them more. A BNP supporter would have to fundamentally change their beliefs to support Labour, unlike with UKIP. 

&gt;No other party has just a close affiliation with child abuse than Labour after Rotherham.

The difference is Labour and it's supporters do not have a general underlying pro-child abuse attitude, nor do labour demonstrate a chance of structuring political policies around an underlying general attitude of support for child abuse.  

&gt;I guess Labour are the paedophie protection party then.

I think it's hilarious you are trying to compare the crimes of individuals within one party to the general bigoted attitude of much of UKIP and it's supporters. 

&gt;Sure, nothing to do with the fact that places with more immigrants would have a lower UKIP vote due to immigrants not voting for a party they view as anti-immigration.

That is true but it doesn't alter the fact that immigrants don't make up that much of the UK, and even British people are less prone to vote UKIP when exposed to greater ethnic diversity. Urban areas have a general tendency to vote more for liberal parties, not because they are swamped with left foreigners, but because people are more open minded as a result of experience. 

&gt;the EU hadn't gauged how Russia would react to the EU expanding up to its border and into it's sphere of influence.

The EU already borders Russia. 

&gt;Russia wants a buffer zone between it and the EU/NATO

The EU is not NATO.

&gt;the EU cut into that when it opened itself up to Ukraine becoming a member.

So the EU is partly to blame for allowing other countries to join? 

&gt; but the EU cannot escape some of the blame.

Sorry but that is bull. Russia are 100% to blame. They're trying to dictate whether or not the Ukraine, a sovereign nation, can join an international union, a union very much based on trade and human rights, not military defence.

Nobody is denying they're right-wing, though they are increasingly adopting left-wing policies now that they're targeting the Labour vote. I was taking issue with your use of the pejorative 'far right' which has connotations of BNP/EDL/National Front. 

&gt;UKIP is the only party that has had to ban EDL and BNP supporters from joining, because as a party it appeals to them more. A BNP supporter would have to fundamentally change their beliefs to support Labour, unlike with UKIP. 

So UKIP are held to higher standards than Labour who get a free ride. Got it. You're just determined to despise UKIP.

&gt;The difference is Labour and it's supporters do not have a general underlying pro-child abuse attitude, nor do labour demonstrate a chance of structuring political policies around an underlying general attitude of support for child abuse. 

Right, it's not like Labour over decades covered the stuff going on in Rotherham up, or that its deputy leader Harriet Harman has ties to paedophile sympathising lobbying groups. Oh wait...

&gt;I think it's hilarious you are trying to compare the crimes of individuals within one party to the general bigoted attitude of much of UKIP and it's supporters. 

Again, huge generalisations based on your own prejudices. People can support UKIP for a whole host of reasons. Hell, even in the vote for policies thread the other day people were finding themselves agreeing with UKIP's health and education polcicies, for example. Using your own bigoted opinions to try and tar millions of supporters as racist/xenophobic etc based on the actions of a very small amount of councillors is wrong.

&gt;Sorry but that is bull. Russia are 100% to blame. They're trying to dictate whether or not the Ukraine, a sovereign nation, can join an international union, a union very much based on trade and human rights, not military defence. 

Like I said, I'm not denying Russia have acted apallingly, but the EU shouldn't let every country in that wants to be let in. Turkey is a sovereign nation that wants to be part of the EU. Doesn't mean the EU should let it in. In expanding into Ukraine and Russia's sphere of influence, the EU has provoked Russia and caused a war. If it was that interested in peace then it wouldn't have opened its arms to Ukraine. Use the 'but for' test.

Maybe I'm wrong, butI think that really shot our confidence. Then there's the innumerable times he started Nolan, even though it's clear to virtually everyone that Nolan can't hack 90 minutes. He has fielded a less than optimal XI several times because of his loyalty to Nolan. Then his saying that our loss to West Brom was either bullshit or showed a complete lack of confidence in the club. We have performed much worse than we did prior to the Christmas period and I believe a large part of that is how he managed the team and his reverting to what's comfortable for him, but that clearly doesn't work best for the team.

Nope. It's nothing to do with standards. I'll simplify the point. The values of the BNP and Labour are incompatible, whereas the values of the BNP and UKIP are compatible, so UKIP has had to make the public gesture of making it's members claim they've not been EDL/BNP/NF members. UKIP supporters however don't have to.  

&gt;Right, it's not like Labour over decades covered the stuff going on in Rotherham up, or that its deputy leader Harriet Harman has ties to paedophile sympathising lobbying groups.

It's funny that you are trying to claim that Labour are a bunch of pedo's especially after you claim I'm determined to despise UKIP. It really demonstrates your failure to grasp how absurd such an accusation is, and how nonsensical your comparison is to the bigoted attitudes of UKIP types. Also please list these paedophile sympathising lobbying groups and explain your accusations towards them. 

&gt;even in the vote for policies thread the other day people were finding themselves agreeing with UKIP's health and education polcicies, for example

UKIP's health policies are bullshit. Everyone knows the party is fundamentally opposed to national health care and wished to privatise as much as it can. Leaked UKIP documents prove it: [Link](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/leaked-documents-show-ukip-leaders-approve-nhs-privatisation-once-it-becomes-more-acceptable-to-the-electorate-9993050.html)
 
&gt;Using your own bigoted opinions to try and tar millions of supporters as racist/xenophobic etc based on the actions of a very small amount of councillors is wrong

No it fucking isn't. Those millions of people are VOTING FOR people in a political party that has demonstrated time and time again that it's member hold prejudiced and bigoted opinions, opinions so fundamental to their beliefs that they can't bloody stop themselves publicly stating them. 

&gt;but the EU shouldn't let every country in that wants to be let in.

Ukraine hadn't even decided it wanted to be in the EU. It was a prospective idea for the future. 

&gt;In expanding, the EU has provoked Russia and caused a war.

Once again, this is absolute nonsense. The EU hadn't expanded, and Ukraine hadn't decided it wanted to be in the EU. Furthermore Finland and Latvia share borders with Russia, and Poland and Lithuania both share borders with Russian territory within Europe. 

&gt;But for the EU opening itself up to Ukrainian membership, would Ukraine be in the position it is in today?

This is the most backwards attempt at blaming the EU for something I've ever seen.   ",null,0,null,1424545293,null,0,false,0,cosot9o,null,t3_2wnqgm,null,t1_cosot9o,null,t1_coso63o,null,null,null,1424715849,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

How far away from Birmingham is your girlfriend willing to live?  If she wants to rail commute you'll need somewhere with a station.  This map therefore gives you your options:
http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/css/NetworkRail_BirminghamWestMidlandsmap.pdf
Some of those stops don't have fast trains stopping at them, and some are very infrequent.

In that area, Stourbridge is about a 50 minute drive from Telford.  Places a bit closer in to Birmingham like Rowley Regis can have quicker driving times to Telford because you use the motorways (but that's disregarding traffic, which is often awful).

Wolverhampton is probably your best bet to suit both commutes since the trains are less than 20 minutes to New St, plus they are more frequent from there.  It takes my partner about 35-40 minutes to drive from Telford to Wolverhampton every day (but we live on the far side of Telford).

To be honest, we would have preferred to live in Shrewsbury but it was too far for my partner to drive every day.

**Position 1:**


&gt; Welfare recipients - except pensioners and some disabled people - are feral, workshy scroungers, who spend our hard earned tax money enabling a lifestyle that sees them sit on their arses all day, eating junk food, smoking fags and drinking industrial strength alcohol, whilst the women spit out kids every nine months, so as to facilitate more money, and breed the next generation of scum.

&gt;Also, the reason teachers and nurses are paid so little is because we spend so much money on these entitled scroungers.

**Position 2:**

&gt;The conservatives are Nazi-esque cunts who're determined to either kill all poor people, or at very least condemn them to a life of servitude. The Work Programme is a modern form of slavery; the final step before the re-introduction of the Workhouse.

&gt;Everyone who works for the DWP, is a member of JCP frontline staff, or has ever even considered voting for the Cuntservatives, is a Nazi sympathiser.

&gt;Also the welfare bill is being reduced because Wayne Rooney is being paid Â£300,000 per week to kick a football around.

--------

The 'debate' around welfare is basically varying degrees of ineptitude, between those two statements.

Because I'm white, a racist incident is a rare and unique occurrence - I don't have to face racism today and tomorrow and the next day, and the day after that.

I might experience it, once in my lifetime, from some yobs on a bus, but I won't have to go home and worry about my neighbour being racist against me, too, and my boss, and the assistant at Tesco.

No they're not, because I asked a question. There's your opportunity to HAVE THE DISCUSSION.

But here's the thing, there's simply no way to articulate this in a way that doesn't out you as, lets say not fully in line with modern thinking.

&gt;UKIP would end the doctrine that it's okay to be in the UK and reject our culture.

What does that mean? A stern talking to? Mandatory viewing of UKIP hour on TV? What is it you *actually* believe is happening here? Was there no crime in Britain before ""ethnics"" got here? You truly believe that? Because as far as I can see these people commited a crime and there have been tools set up to combat that for a long time. 

What extra would UKIP do? How would it help in *this* situation?

What ""culture"" is it you believe the people who did this follow? Do you know what culture is? Define it and then explain how racist harassment fits into one. As a black person are you actually saying racism is part of black culture?

&gt;...as well as limiting immigration so that problems like this are minimised in the future

So you are privy to the perpetrators of this crime? Is there a reason you haven't called the police? Because while you call out my strawman you're making statements that assume you know exactly who committed these crimes and how long they've been here.

When did the Windrush land? The 50's? Those people have had kids who have also had kids! 

So now 60 years later we're talking about minimizing immigration? So what we don't have these problems in 2075? You think UKIP will have policies that far reaching? How naive are you?

It's exactly as I thought and you've just proven it. There's no way to ""have the conversation"" without A, making this about people of different races, EVEN THE ONES BORN HERE TO PARENTS WHO WERE BORN HERE.

That's why people don't want to talk about. They end up revealing how ill thought out their ""totally reasonable, not racist"" justifications are.

He's picked up some criticism this season for various reasons. I'd agree that he can have a discipline problem, but there's two things I've always disagreed with; I don't think he's ever 'not looked bothered', and I definitely think he doesn't lack talent.

I think he's one of those players who can't help but be obvious with his emotions. When things are good, he looks like the main man, but when he's not at his best he looks visibly frustrated, which can be misinterpreted as a lack of desire to succeed (the 'dropped shoulders' look). When this comes up, I always think of Alan Tate - in terms of on-pitch demeanor, they're practically twins. 

The other issue I've covered a lot is that I think he's entirely wasted in front of the defence. He's had a run of games further forward and he's won us a few points in a short space of time. When he gets to play his own game, he succeeds. I don't know who got man of the match today, but my personal pick is Jonjo because he stepped up and made the small chances turn into goals today.

- Handball call is pretty blatant. I would be okay with a no-call if his hands were by his side since he wasn't that far away from the shot. 

- Costa penalty call is a bit weak, but you really can't push a player with two hands in the box. This one could've went either way and I think because of Costa's wrongly attributed reputation he didn't get the call. This was Costa looking for the foul and the Burnley player giving it to him, but the ref not accepting it since Costa was obviously going for the foul. 

- Matic foul was an obvious red for both players. Although, if Barnes got the first red I think Matic would've left him alone. 

All-in-all, what can you do. Gotta get on with it and win the next matches. Would be nice if the FA reduced the 3 match ban, but that's highly doubtful. Cuadrado looked solid today, I thought. Not much of an attacking threat, but also very solid when he got the ball and in defense. Willian looked amazing when he came on -- playing very confidently. Oscar gave the ball away cheaply a few times. Doesn't seem like a threat taking on players one-on-one. Costa played like shit most of the game with too many easy offside calls.

UKIP are getting a lot of coverage, due to their performance in local council elections - they're projected to get, at best, a handful of MPs in the forthcoming General Election.

It gets a bad reputation (clearly!) but it's not all bad.  Very close access to some beautiful countryside, Ironbridge is very pretty, nice restaurants &amp; boozers - the 'centre' of Telford isn't a centre at all, it's a big shopping mall with some new chain restaurants attached, cinema etc.

If you work here (like I do) then I'd suggest living on the outskirts of the town (like I do), avoid the large housing estates if you can, they're just kinda depressing. You'll certainly need a car - public transport is shite.  

It's a 'new' town, spread out with no real organic growth (think Milton Keynes), and with that comes the bad reputation but house prices are good and you're close enough to Brum if you want some real urban life or the countryside if you like walking (I live near the Wrekin and it's a beautiful area to walk around if you're into outdoorsy stuff).  Shropshire is a beautiful county. 

I don't think it's any chavier than another large town of its size and contrary to local popular belief, we don't have the highest rate of teenage pregnancy in Europe.

Source? Majority of CCTV seen in the UK are private owned. Government owned CCTV is usually only seen in criminal hotspots, and busy places.

It depends on how serious is the crime that decides whether CCTV evidence is used or not. If it's something like pickpocketing, then no. Bank robbery? Obviously yes. As you mentioned problem with your bike getting stolen, I don't think they would bother to find a CCTV footage. You'd have go and ask private CCTV owners and hope they give it to you. Even if you have video evidence, the police usually won't investigate.

&gt;If yes, I might seriously considering moving, since the house I live in Bruxelles has been broken into and burglarized, and my bike was stolen in the center of the the city today, and the police here doesn't care at all.

CCTV is rarely seen in residential streets. To get the police interested, you need some evidence that links the burglars. The police is unlikely to be interested in bike burglars in city centres as well.

If you mean that you've lived full-time in Scotland for four years before the beginning of your course, you may be eligible for maintenance loans, yes. Check the student finance website and contact them if you're still unsure. I believe that anyone who's lived in the UK for over three years before the start of their course qualifies as a home student rather than EU.

&gt;I'm moving with my british girlfiend (who intents to work full time) with me doing university (and working part time on weekends). Do landlords require proof of employment? If so, should we start looking for a job at the place of my study first and accomodation next?

As far as I'm aware, it's up to the landlord. They will ask both of you for a guarantor (probably your parents) who will have to agree to pay your rent if you fail to. Your girlfriend having a full-time job before trying to rent the house definitely wouldn't be a bad idea though. 

&gt;Is there any help, and what specific help we could get in terms of living costs in case of renting a small flat? (not sure if it's that SAAS loan that applies to me. apparently it applies to residents but i'm not quite sure)

Not if you're a student, I believe; it's maintenance loan (if you're eligible), any grants you can scrounge up, parents' help and a part time job. Your girlfriend will also be liable to pay council tax for the whole property because she's not a student; research this because it's often more than people expect. Check your university for bursaries or scholarships too.

I have to disagree with you on that one. I've only ever lost one bolt that was torqued to spec on my bikes, and even then it had a massive non-oem tax disc holder on it (in retrospect I probably should have bought a longer bolt). My current bike is a real PITA because the previous owner has either over torqued a bolt to within an inch of its life or used loctite on small fasteners where it just isn't necessary. It's not fun working on a bike where it feels like every bolt is about to snap on you.

My own personal thoughts on what to use are:

1.) Copper-Grease where the fastener is a different type of material (except where extreme heat will bake it, like on an exhaust)

2.) Medium strength loctite where the manual calls for any thread lock. (Strictly speaking you should use high strength on some applications, e.g. brake disc bolts, but I think medium will be enough).

The most important thing is to buy a torque wrench and use it!

For one bolt to work it's way undone would be pretty unlucky, for two to work loose I'd say it's pretty obvious they weren't torqued down properly.

Also: If you can steal the girlfriend's make up set you can put a dab of nail varnish (any colour, it'll oxidise to black) on the edge of a bolt pointing at 12 o'clock and then you can easily see if it's worked loose at all.",null,0,null,1424552985,null,0,false,0,cossojx,null,t3_2wnv9m,null,t1_cossojx,null,t1_coso60e,null,null,null,1424717654,null,1,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,1,null

Brendan hasn't trusted him to play in the past 3 months so we need to sell him. Simply isn't good enough. (Player must currently be injured or on loan).: **Coates**

Future captain, Liverpool legend (Player must have played less than 2 games for Liverpool but did an alright job): **Rossiter**

Future captain, Liverpool legend (Must have commented about how much they hated the player just a few months ago): **skrtel?**

Overrated, incredibly expensive player Liverpool will definitely sign this summer: **either Lacazette or Pjanic**

Player who made simple but costly mistake that I would have sold in January, simply not good enough (must be starting player integral to team): **n/a**

Amazing young player who is the next Raheem Sterling (player must not be over 16 and never played more than 2 games): **don't know**

It is expensive to live here but the wages are no better. The odd thing about Brighton is that the jobs on offer here (and in reality, the sort of jobs you'll be looking for with your qualifications) are not high paying.

There are quite a few jobs going in Brighton for people under 30 and not that very well qualified. They are generally call center, customer service, cafe/restaurant type of jobs. But remember, Brighton is a city with 2 big universities and so there is a lot of competition in the low qualifications job market and you might not be able to make it. However if you do make it to Brighton, message me and I can get you a job interview at the company I work for. They hire about 10 new people a week. It's working in a call center doing charity fundraising and they have such a high staff turn over rate that they let anybody that can speak English in.

From what you've said, I really don't think moving to the UK with Â£2800 to live off for 2/3 months is a great idea. The cost of living is higher here than on the continent and whilst there are new jobs being created the competition is fierce and often wages are low.

In regards to saving money, I don't know if you'd be able to save that much. Getting a job in the first place will be tricky with your limited experience. That is why jobs like call centers are great for this as they require no passed experience. However these jobs will pay you the lowest amount. 

With your grasp of foreign languages, I strongly recommend you look into ""Teaching English as a Foreign Language"". You can do courses here in Brighton and then look for work. There are SO MANY language schools in Brighton it's ridiculous. We always have thousands of French and Spanish students in our city trying to learn English. I think this would be an excellent option for you as you already speak the language and it does not require past experience. 

The problem with Brighton is that there are so many students and that drives up rents. Landlords are converting houses to be student houses and flats are getting taken up quickly. You might be able to get a small 1 bed flat, or a studio apartment that could help you save money.

Brighton is a great city. It has fantastic services, it's young, vibrant and has a very good nightlife. It's easy to get to London or go out into the countryside. The city has a very friendly and open culture and there are always things to do.

null,false,alpinerod,null,null,null,"Sorry, I guess my point of view isn't very popular around here, but here is some logic behind the thinking. May not happen this season, but the vector of the team is there -- and it is looking good. We have, unexpectedly, improved in the one area that the team has been lacking over the past decade -- and that is a clinical finisher. I have not seen a week-in week-out performances from Ade, Defoe, Berba, Crouch, Keane, Pavlyuchenko, Rebrov, Iversen (am I missing someone?) that I see from Kane. Soldado falls right in with that group -- not bad, but not great either. A disclaimer - I don't go to many games as I don't live in the UK even, but I do catch pretty much every game either on TV or via streams that are graciously posted here. I cannot remember in my time of being a fan a goalie of the quality of Huge Hugo. In terms of CBs -- we don't have Ledley anymore, but the current guys aren't shabby either; in the midfield we have players who can boss pretty much any opposition the way they want to and are young to boot. Wingers - I'm not sold on Lamela to be honest, but things aren't looking terrible either. Eriksen behind the striker - no need to comment on that.

In terms of positioning - I see us finishing above scum for sure. Even if not this season, the vectors Spurs and woolwich are on are quite different.  We have been playing significantly better recently than what I've seen under AVB or Redknapp (more consistent and with more determination to win). 
Liverpool have been a Suarez team for a few years resurgent, and all of a sudden, the biter is gone. They have some talent, they have speed, but they have not looked better than us. Not consistently better at least.
City and United -- are two great clubs, one new and one old, that have been dealing with some problems of their own. 
Chelsea is amazing, but don't be surprised if some changes are inbound given the current geopolitical situation. Nobody will want a club indirectly owned by Putin to be in their backyard, and Abramovich era may be coming to an abrupt end.
Even disregarding that -- the answer to the question which two clubs of the above we should be finishing above of -- the answer is pool and scum.

He's not committed to the cause, we don't look like the Keystone Cops without him playing (which admittedly was the case sometimes last season but that said more about the other players in our squad than it did about Vlaar) so I'd leave him out.

Player who made simple but costly mistake that I would have sold in January, simply not good enough (must be starting player integral to team): **Lovren**

Amazing young player who is the next Raheem Sterling (player must not be over 16 and never played more than 2 games):**Dunno**

Ex-Liverpool player we will definitely sign this summer: **None**

No I'm serious on that last one:

&gt;comments of Cambridge parliamentary candidate Rupert Read which were viewed as transphobic, describing trans women as âa sort of âopt-inâ version of what it is to be a woman.â He has since apologised, as has Bennett, but it was certainly an embarrassing incident for a party which promises to take a lead in protecting trans rights in their EU manifesto.

&gt;But Iâve accepted that apology, I think Rupert is seeking to move forward and I think the Green Party is and remains a real champion in LGBTIQ rights and thatâs something Iâm very proud of

&gt;*Maintaining a good reputation on feminist issues certainly seems to be a key part of the partyâs appeal.* Their focus may be the environment, but Bennett is a self-proclaimed feminist, and she sees a lot of matters as connected.

&gt;**âWeâve always viewed environmental issues and social justice as indivisible.** But I think whatâs really clearer in peopleâs heads is that we at the moment are in an economic crisis, a social crisis, an environmental crisis, and the fact theyâre all happening at the same time isnât an accident. Itâs actually interlinked. We have this system, the way weâre running our economy and society at the moment thatâs simply unsustainable in all of those terms: economically, socially, environmentally. We have to change the whole system.â

Assuming you *are* entitled to work, only having a year makes you unlikely to get a good permanent job, people are not going to want to invest time and money training someone they know will leave before the year is out. Though if you have job skills that fit well into contracting - that may be an option, though with no experience, I kind of doubt it.

Where you live is entirely a matter of choice, everywhere has its pros and cons, depends on what sort of place you want. Rural idyll; funky and happening metropolitan lifestyle; Something in between?

Masters: possible - yes, a number of universities have part time masters courses, so you can do it while working a job. Financially - university is expensive in the UK. UK students get funding that is paid back through taxation (""Student Loan"", but fairly similar to a graduate tax) so is less of a concern to us. Obviously that's not open to you, you would have to look at your own government's funding arrangements. If you have none, then you will have to fund it yourself, Looking at the price of [a MSc in economics from a London Uni](http://www.bbk.ac.uk/study/2015/postgraduate/programmes/TMSECNMC_C/) that specialises in part time courses, you are looking at about Â£9000 a year for two years.

Although I do think race-based discrimination and racism should be considered different. There is the colloquial definition of racism (prejudice against someone based on their race) but I have always used the word to describe patterns throughout society taking into account relationships of power. Not a definition people on Reddit tend to like but I think its more useful. 

Eh, whichever definition we use. Pretty clear that the wider context should be considered (like you say). That is all I was getting at. Did not mean to start a whole debate about semantics.

Furlong impressed me today, and perhaps you're right in saying they would never have got a look in under Harry, but people are getting ahead of themselves with Ramsey, most of all Tony Fernandes and his ludicrous talk of saying he's got every chance of being the QPR manager next season after winning one game. Making decisions based on emotion rather than logic and level-headed thinking has always been his problem unfortunately, and his tendency to go all in with his managers has come back to bite him time and time again. I just wish he took things day by day this time - which he showed signs of doing this time - but unfortunately we're putting complete faith in one guy again. 

I was wondering when somebody would finally ask me why I'm suddenly so much more pessimistic. The reason is that when this sort of result would happen people would be calling for Harry's head. When we lost to Swansea it was all doom and gloom, but now we've gone and concerned last minute goals and done the exact same thing against Hull and Southampton and everything's rosy because Ramsey wants to give young players a chance. The football's the same, Green is still bailing us out with a world class save every game. For me at least I can't see any change in our prospects, and I'd almost go as far as to say that Ramsey's trying to impress Fernandes more than he's trying to get results when he brings on players like Traore and Doughty and leaves Vargas on the bench.

null,false,MalcontentUK,null,null,null,"Hey, welcome to the UK, I think it's a good choice (although I am very biased!) and I think you'll find it a generally friendly, safe and welcoming place to live. We may whinge alot but the quality of life on offer is good.

In terms of getting a job, getting a very basic job (as in minimum wage, no qualifications) is relatively straight forward anywhere in the UK but pay is low and it can be difficult to live well  - particularly in London. Its an expensive country, but London especially is very expensive. A better bet would be to look at getting a graduate level job lined up - there are many recruitment agencies out there (search online) and it might be worth contacting them to see whats possible. Don't worry if you don't manage it, but if you do it will really help. A minimum wage job in a city outside London pays enough to get settled while looking for something better, but a minimum wage job in London is tough.

Where you live and work is the most critical choice. London has the most jobs and on paper pays well but is also by far the most expensive to live. I personally would be very reluctant to move straight to London unless you do get a graduate level job lined up there or you know people who live there. Otherwise I'd start with Manchester or Birmingham - they are big cosmopolitan cities with decent jobs and quality of life, plus you can move from them to London if you do get a good job there if its where you really want to be. I'm not sure where in the world you're from but I'd also say Manchester or Birmingham are both international cities in their mix, are large places with vibrant social lifes available but much cheaper than London. Other cities like Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leeds, Sheffield and Cardiff are also good places to live, but I personally think Manchester and Birmingham (the two biggest cities after london) are better starting points if you don't know the UK.

In terms of a Masters degree, doing a minimum wage job can be done around your degree but it will definitely not be enough on its own to support you and cover fees. You can't usually fit a full time Masters degree around a good fulltime job. Good Master's degrees are competitive and expensive (especially as a non-EU student!), and you will likely need loans to fund it. It is doable but requires careful planning and consideration. Also you have to be careful where you do it - not all UK universities are equal - as a *very rough* rule of thumb the so called [Russell Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Group) universities includes the 24 best universities in the country and would be the place to start researching Master's options (the wiki page lists the 24, Manchester and Birmingham universities are in the group among many others). There are many other good universities too but I'd start with them if you don't know much about our unis. Also the [Open University](http://www.open.ac.uk/postgraduate) is a highly regarded correspondance and part-time government funded university - employers in the UK are very favourable towards their degrees because they are as rigorous as any good uni degree but also require dedication to fit them around work and life. I don't know what the international reputation is like though.

In terms of hardship, the main one is adjusting to the cost of living (you may be shocked how expensive everything is, although the pay is generally higher in proportion to it). The other thing to be aware of is that you need to research where you end up moving to; like any country we do have rough and dangerous areas, and we also have racist and unwelcoming areas. Please don't worry though - racist and dangerous areas are few in number and in size but if you move to the wrong part of any city you may have a very unhappy time. As a generality moving to the areas around the universities in a big UK city is generally safe, cheaper and will have a more international flavour which might make arrival and settling in easier. This might be obvious but don't just move to the cheapest area of the city you want to go to - we may be a very safe country but we do still have crime, its generally compressed into small areas of our big cities which the locals know to avoid.

The other piece of advice I'd give is mix with people! We Brits are friendly and welcoming but we are a bit reserved and respect the idea of personal independence so you need to put yourself out there and try new things if you want to meet people. Otherwise we just let people get on with their lives and leave them in peace; that could make people feel a bit lonely and isolated if they don't realise thats just our culture. If you chat to people and go to events, and try new things you'll find us just as friendly and welcoming as any other part of the world.

Without the Europa ties we have great league form, we're competitive and ever-improving and there's no reason why we **can't** give the top four competitors a scare at the least. A top four finish with a cup win would be a dream - and if we could only get the latter I would still be on cloud nine. 

Being realistic; we will not win the Europa without sacrificing a top four finish. Too many games like you said, too much probability for injury and fatigue, and if we fell at the final hurdle after crippling our league hopes that would be a sorry shame. 

All that said we should not give up. Like you said, our second string players form a good team and there's every chance they can do a number over Fiorentina if they put them to the sword - the shame is we couldn't capitalise on our home fixture and take a solid lead back to Italy with us, that would've been mighty comforting. 

I would say send the weaker team for sure. Rest Kane, Eriksen, Vertonghen and the rest of our key players (our 100% starters in tough games) but still field a competitive enough side to at least give it a decent go.

I also like the fact that he's played in the Premier League, and wouldn't have to adapt as so many players struggle to do. And the main reason I think he's a good fit is he's phenomenal in the air. Can play those flicks ons that Drogba likes to do and is an aerial threat off set pieces, something we don't have.

The television channels in the UK can be distinguished by the way they are financed. First, the channels of the BBC are public and financed by the television license. Second, channels like ITV, Channel 4, and Channel 5 are financed by advertising. Third, some channels, such as Sky News, Sky Sports, Sky Movies, Comedy Central, and Discovery Channel, are financed by cable and satellite subscriptions (sometimes combined with advertising income). So the television license only covers the BBC (but never watching BBC is not an excuse for not paying the television license).

I understand that most channels in the US fall in the third category. In the UK, the most-wached channels all fall in the first or second category. Therefore, many of them are available for free (DVB-T/satellite) or for a minimal cost (cable for 5 pound per month). So if you have cable, indeed you need to pay both for the license and the provider, but I assume the cost for the provider is much lower than in the US. In fact, many of the popular channels (like those of the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5) are designated as [public service broadcasting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_service_broadcasting_in_the_United_Kingdom). In contrast to the US, the operators of these channels [are not allowed](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/media/11082056/ITV-goes-into-battle-with-BSkyB-and-Virgin-over-100m-fees-for-main-channel.html) to charge the cable/satellite providers to distribute their programmes, hence the low cost of cable subscriptions. If you have no special interest in particular sports, movies, or channels like Comedy Central, you'll probably do fine with only having channels of the first two categories.

The channels are distributed in the following ways:

* Freeview, which is the brand name in the UK for DVB-T (digital terrestrial television). Obviously only include channels from the first two categories.
* Satellite. The providers are Freesat (free) and Sky. The latter offers a paid subscription and a free subscription, which is confusingly called Freesat from Sky. Again, Freesat and Freesat from Sky only include channels from the first two categories, while the full Sky package also includes subscription-financed channels.
* Cable: the only cable provider is Virgin (except WightFibre which operator on the Isle of Wight). They have multiple packages, some of which do and some of which don't include the (relatively expensive) channels that are financed by cable subscriptions.
* Freeview+internet combination. This is basically Freeview combined with a couple of extra (subscription-financed) channels delivered through the internet. Providers include BT and Talktalk. The cheaper of their packages don't even include the internet channels, and instead only give you a Freeview box (which might easily fool people into thinking they are getting more value for their money than they actually do).",null,0,null,1424570185,null,0,1424570638,0,cot14og,null,t3_2why2i,null,t1_cot14og,null,t3_2why2i,null,null,null,1424721814,null,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1,null

If someone like that were to come in, we'd be getting rid of Ramires and I don't see that happening anytime soon and there are a lot of other more important things to worry about. 

Agree about the **Centrebacks**, 100% need to find someone both young (or at least not too old) and good. Varane would fit this perfectly but I highly highly doubt Madrid would let him go. 

As for **strikers**, someone else already mentioned this but Dybala would be great, but I think he's too good to be behind Remy in the pecking order, and if he does come in, then either Remy or Dybala wouldn't be happy, and honestly I'm happy with Remy. 

Id love to bring in Bamford back from boro but I want him to keep developing, but I think he'd be a perfect 3rd striker. Hard one this.

&gt;

&gt;__Burntollet Bridge__ was the setting for an attack during the first stages of the [Troubles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles) of [Northern Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland).  A [People's Democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Democracy_(Ireland\)) march from [Belfast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast) to [Derry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derry) was attacked whilst passing through Burntollet on 4 January 1969.

&gt;The march had been called in defiance of an appeal by Northern Ireland Prime Minister [Terence O'Neill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_O%27Neill) for a temporary end to protest; older and less radical members of the [Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Civil_Rights_Association) also opposed the march as provocative and likely to cause violence. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] Supporters of [Ian Paisley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Paisley), led by Major [Ronald Bunting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Bunting), denounced the march as seditious and mounted counter-demonstrations along the route. 

&gt;At Burntollet an [Ulster loyalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_loyalist) crowd, including 100 off-duty members of the [Ulster Special Constabulary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_Special_Constabulary) (all of the organisers of the attack were USC), numbering in the region of 300,        attacked the civil rights marchers from adjacent high ground. Stones transorted in bulk from William Leslie's quarry at Legahurry were used in the assault,  as well as iron bars and sticks spiked with nails. Nearby members of the [Royal Ulster Constabulary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Ulster_Constabulary) did little to prevent the violence.   Many of the marchers described their assailants' lack of concern about the police presence. Numerous photographs of the violence appeared in the media and led to comparisons with attacks on [black civil rights marchers by Southern white racists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Civil_Rights_Movement_(1955%E2%80%9368\)) in the US.

You could make the argument that Dzeko has been the more 'reliable' striker over the three year period you mention; given he's match fit more often, while maintaining a respectable goal scoring record.

But 'consistent' is a whole other matter.

Aguero is the more consistent player. He has the best goals to minutes ratio in Premier League history. But most importantly he's less prone to blowing hot and cold the way Dzeko often does - he is *consistent*. The more consistent of the two.

null,false,Titanomakhia,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,null,"Or, a much more sensible explanation is that the EU is a set of political institutions bringing together people from a number of different countries and political backgrounds to represent a broad range of political views. From Socialists to Greens to Liberals to Conservatives to whatever the hell Nigel Farage and the Front National have created. 

Thousands of people have had an influence on the direction the EU is taking - the problem with the conspiracy theory is that you have to assume that, despite coming from different countries, different parties and arguing publicly over literally every tiny little thing such that it becomes a running joke that the EU is so inefficient, 99% of them all apparently agree, without fail and to the point where they don't even need to discuss it in any public forum, on the biggest constitutional change to the European continent in about 430 years. That seems really *really* insane to me. 

And evidently false. There are 5 explicitly Eurosceptic and anti-federalist groups in the European Parliament receiving a total of â¬4,330,000 in funding from the same institution they are trying to destroy. Around 1 in 3 MEPs are Eurosceptic. And the rest are not all federalists - Labour and the Lib Dems all have many MEPs and are not federalist parties. Most German parties are not explicitly in favour of federalism - in fact the German people are very weary of federalism mainly because it would mean German taxpayers propping up Eastern and Southern European countries much like how California props up the United States. Most countries have pro-EU majorities that are not pro-federalism. 

You say people won't openly admit they're all federalists but to illustrate why that's wrong look at the interest groups directed at EU issues. Among them are groups like The Spinelli Group which explicitly calls for a federal Europe and is named after the founder of the Union of European Federalist. The fact that they have a public manifesto and free open membership to anyone that signs the manifesto leads me to believe that that this isn't a secret, or at least if it is secret they're doing a really shit job. In fact the founder of the Spinelli group, Guy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian PM, is the leader of a strongly pro-EU group in the EU parliament and president of the Union of European Federalists. If he wanted to hide his opinions then public positions in federalist organisations was a really dumb way to go about that. 

Of course there are also people like The Bruges Group; it's a think tank associated with the UK Conservative Party which subscribes specifically to Margaret Thatcher's view on Europe, namely eternally combative and stubborn as long as it doesn't affect Conservative Party donors (haha).  They're existence proves a point perhaps - they aren't anti-EU but they want to reform it into something they like but they are still part of the fabric of European political complex. They aren't federalists and they oppose federalism in the EU. I don't quite know where exactly in your 99% of secret federalist conspirators they may fit but it seems like there are plenty of people who are willing to talk about EU federalism and some people openly support it and some people openly fight it. That's the problem with secret plans that are obvious. If they're so obvious they can't be very secret. 

Another thing I don't get about the conspiracy theory - the EU does not have a single unifying agenda except what it contained in the treaties. Even anti-EU people know this and argue this - they moan about how the EU has changed and mutated from a trade organisation into a governmental organisation implying, of course, that the EU is what it's leaders make of it and has very little to do with any formal constitution or mission statement which would limit it's expansion. If the EU is pro-federalist then that's because federalists keep getting into positions of power but the EU is just the organisational infrastructure they use to push their political agendas. The EU can be anything it's leaders want it to be. If you dislike European federalism it's fine but blaming the EU itself is like blaming the concept of the British parliament for raising tuition fees. Just because something you don't like happened doesn't make the concept or institution bad - how could it? It's bricks and mortar and it's meaningless without people. 

So the EU could be great but we need to fill the EU with the right people. However we can't do that with a 35% turnout at EU elections. The reality is that people don't care. People bitch and moan about the EU but they don't have any idea what it even does or how it works. [80% people don't even know who their MEP is. (By the way that means that 15% of people voted in the EU election but didn't actually bother to find out if their party won or not.) 17% of people think the EU sets our income tax rates. Very nearly 1 in every 4 people in the UK think the EU has control over our army and where it is deployed.](https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/650/UK-On-Europe-Low-On-Knowledge-Low-On-Trust.aspx) How can you work with this level of ignorance? I think people project they're own ignorance about the EU onto the EU itself. They assume that because they know so little it must be because the EU is hiding it from them. So they form a negative opinion of these apparent conspirators and because they never bothered to learn any information in the first place their view is never challenged. Hence we have the current UKIP conspiracy, through to UKIPs credit they vote which is more than you can say for 65% of the eligible voting public who are mostly happy to give an opinion one way or the other in a poll or survey ('Don't Know' answers normally get about 15-20% of responses to most surveys on the EU) but can't be arsed to actually participate in the process of shaping they way the EU is run. 

I also question why they people simply assume that all EU leaders have the same opinion - what exactly has led people to believe that Jean Claude Junker has the same opinions as Donald Tusk? In fact I believe David Cameron *specifically and explicitly* said that he was supporting Tusk for Council President because he would be a counter weight to Junker and the federalist section of EU politics and he would be open to reform of the EU. Where does Tusk fit into the 99% of federalist conspirators?

However even assuming my some miracle Tusk is now an EU federalist and he's just not telling anyone - why might that be? Why are the majority of MEPs and European groups pro-EU? MEP's are directly elected and the Commission president is chosen by the European Council of directly elected national leaders and taking into account the direct vote for the Parliament. In other words the EU is the way it is because European people are pro-EU. The UK is one of the most anti-EU countries in the EU. Trust is the EU is lower here than almost anywhere else. However even we are split down the middle pretty much 50/50. [Of the 40 polls taken in the UK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposed_referendum_on_United_Kingdom_membership_of_the_European_Union#Standard_polling_on_EU_membership) regarding how people would vote in an EU referendum the group voting to stay in the EU won 23/40. Pretty even. Of the 5 polls taken in 2015 the group wanting to stay has one 3 - again pretty even. Of the 26 polls taken in from 2013-2015 asking if people would want to remain in a reformed EU the group that would want to stay won every single poll except 1 with most being over 50%. And we are apparently the bulwark of anti-EU populism in the EU; we are the people that hate the EU the most and even we are split down the middle tending to lean towards liking it. Just imagine what the rest of Europe feels. And then people wonder why most elected EU politicians or politicians appointed by elected politicians are all strongly pro EU...it's just democracy. 

It's not a conspiracy - it's politics. If UKIP's official party spokespeople want to believe they are fighting secret federalists who are also secret Nazis intent on invading the UK then they can.

Airships are vastly more efficient than planes. They might be slower, but they don't have to blast along at several hundred kmph just to not fall out of the sky. They're perfect for transporting large amounts of non-urgent cargo at a low cost. You could also use them for passenger service over short-medium distances. Going by airship from one end of the UK to the other would be quicker and conceivably cheaper than by train. 

Additionally, like helicopters you can land them anywhere which is flat and large enough to take them, meaning they can go to places with very poor or even no infrastructure, with a much larger load and using a lot less fuel than a helicopter could. 

&gt;far more dangerous than a plane

Actually much safer, as long as you fill them with Helium. Hydrogen was used for the vast German airships because of export bans by the USA, which is the world's largest Helium producer. Hydrogen of course is explosive, whilst Helium is inert.

Even so, the famous Hindenburg Disaster was actually pretty light on casualties - most of the passengers and crew walked away from it. It's worth noting that in the case of a puncture (the major threat to an airship), because they are actually kept at a fairly low pressure, the ship simply floats to the ground quite safely. Compared to a helicopter which drops like a stone or a plane which has limited gliding capability in the case of mechanical failure, airships are probably the safest way to fly.

That was the Civil Rights March in Derry in 1968 when the RUC baton charged the crowd, that caused 2 days of rioting and then the People's Democracy was formed, [CAIN link](http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/derry/events.htm). 

ITV in the UK dropped all programs about Northern Ireland, which I didn't know, and the BBC had all their news vetted by top management in London before being aired. [Here's an article](http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/archive/chronicle/1960s/document9.shtml) on how the BBC dealt with reporting about Northern Ireland.  There is also this [PDF document](http://dit.ie/icr/media/diticr/documents/3%20Ivory.pdf) about RTE's coverage of the troubles at the time. 

From what I remember being told years back was RTE and Channel 4 were really the only trusted news sources for nationalists during the troubles. Channel 4 seemed to do a lot coverage and a lot of their own in-depth journalist investigations at the time. 

&gt; press coverage help people? 

You could really write a book on that questions but in short yes, it helped Catholics seeking civil rights get global coverage and no, when certain things were being reported tensions would rise and more trouble will flare up in various parts of Northern Ireland. Even today our news can cause a lot of tension, especially during marching season.

But this all goes back to fundamental differences on what constitutes the definition of consistency however.

I see 'consistency', used in this context in football (and I think it's a fairly mainstream perception) as a direct reference to form. Consistency of performances.

I think what you two guys are doing is stretching the definition to include availability for matches in conjunction with performances. And I couldn't disagree more. I'd describe that as reliability, two entirely separate measures.

And if you were to say Dzeko has been the more reliably match fit striker, or even just outright more reliable, I'd be more inclined to agree.

Then we got Sterling, Ibe, Ojo and Wilson from the academy. Which is almost unheard when you think about it. 

Ojo will turn 18 this year, so if we will go by the way Ibe has done it the last couple of years. After this half year loan he will need an upper level championship or premier league loan (a whole year). So that is still a whole year until he might be ready to play for us. But since players like Ibe and Sterling are such rare cases in football and some players peak later than others we should give the kid the time to develop until he is 20, so one year in championship and then one year in premier league. 

Harry Wilson on the other hand I think needs a couple of more years, adding muscles on his body etc. I would say he is a bigger talent than Ojo, but OjoÂ´s physicality makes him earlier ready than Wilson. Remember that Gareth Barry did not really start shining up premier league until he was 22/23. 

But at this point he is not our biggest need for sure. Lallana and Markovic first year at the club, Sterling will further improve, Ibe as well, Origi is coming back, Coutinho could be used there. Loads of good wingers in the team. The only reason i could see us getting him would be as a stopgap waiting for Ojo to be good enough for the first team and giving Sterling some rest, he has been playing way too much this season.
