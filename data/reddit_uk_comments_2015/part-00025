Funding from taxation also means that the NHS is linked to every social issue. It means that every lifestyle choice that is frowned up needs to be regulated ""because it costs the NHS"" instead of the patient seeing the costs and being free to regulate themselves.

I guess the problem with health care is its multi faceted and does include things like mental health and social care for those who need it due to ill health.  At what point does say contributing to funding a high speed rail link or buying into trident overtake the need to stop people living in misery?  You only have to look at the US or more extremely say India when the states supposed needs are greater than it's subjects.  I agree that some issues like tattoo removal or elective plastic surgery are debatable but without looking at figures and guessing, I doubt this eating up a large part of the NHS budget.

Maybe the funds raised by taxes need to be ring fenced by government so that they don't get spent on other areas?  Just an idea but by example, maybe we should ditch Trident until we can afford it and have the NHS ring fenced so that funds don't get diverted into private company's profits?

Premium bonds pay an average return of 1.35% per year, with no risk. You won't lose any money, but the chances of winning more than 1.35% in the long term are poor. Currently the (RPI) interest rate is 1.6%. That means your 1.35% in Premium Bonds is actually losing money *in real terms*. I explained this a few months ago in pimpin' terms:

&gt;The superfly pimp hat I want is £1000. I have £1000 saved, but I decide to keep saving it in my cash ISA and buy the superfly pimp hat next year.

&gt;One year later, the £1000 in my cash ISA has become £1017, thanks to 1.7% interest. Unfortunately, the superfly pimp hat has risen in price to £1019, because of 1.9% inflation.

&gt;I can no longer afford to buy the superfly pimp hat. The longer the time I wait, the wider that gap will get. I am forced to buy a slightly less fly pimp hat, weakening my pimp hand significantly.

&gt;If my investment had returned more than the 1.9% of inflation, I would have been able to afford an even more fly pimp hat, increasing the respect given to me by hookers, johns, and other pimps alike.

Though my specific concern is that appeals don't even touch on the matter in question. Appeals don't generally deal with matters of fact (i.e. appeals don't even question the decisions of the jury) and don't question the judge unless there is a serious misunderstanding of the law. Appeals only tend to go ahead if the judge screwed up massively or new evidence emerges. In this case the law itself is entirely inappropriate and the appeals courts do not have a mechanism to deal with it.

The person in question is forced to go to the massively oversubscribed high court (which already rejects all manner of cases simply because they don't have time) or the ECHR.

My preference is to allow an appeal to proceed on matters where the law is obviously broken but to render any judgement only as a call to action either on parliament or the high court.

&gt;In March 2010, a new report on UK levelised generation costs was published by [Parsons Brinckerhoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsons_Brinckerhoff).  It puts a range on each cost due to various uncertainties. [Combined cycle gas turbines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_cycle_gas_turbine) without [CO2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide) capture are not directly comparable to the other low carbon emission generation technologies in the [BP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BP) study. The assumptions used in this study are given in the report.

&gt;Divide the above figures by 1000 to obtain the price in pounds per kilowatt-hour.

&gt;More recent UK estimates are the Mott MacDonald study released by [DECC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Energy_and_Climate_Change) in June 2010

Don't get me wrong I think page 3 is crap and slightly odious, but when a moral panic causes us to censor something that gets my liberal-spidy senses tingling.

I also think that if we look at prudishness on a global scale we find we have Saudi Arabia on one end and France on the other, with the UK about 75% of the way towards France. And what do you know, if you look at misogyny on a global scale we  find we have Saudi Arabia on one end and France on the other, with the UK about 75% of the way towards France.

Now I'm not saying anything clearly bollocks as ""tits in the paper will lead to us giving women more respect"". But I do think that viewing women's secondary sexual organs as shameful and dirty is a bad sign for any society and we shouldn't be surprised about where that leads.

And I do realise that the lascivious manner in which page 3 operates is not a good thing for even the most sex positive of feminisms. But I think the reaction to it is typical of the deeply flawed way the Brits deal with things that make them uncomfortable: bury it deeper, stick it out of sight and out of mind, and whatever you do don't try addressing it.

Basically I would like to live in France, a country which is much more feminist than the UK, a country in which things like page 3 and lads mags don't exist because there isn't a market for them - not because of some mob diktat from the forces of small c conservatism, and where public toplessness is commonplace enough for us to not be ridiculous about tits.",null,0,null,1421754644,null,0,false,0,cnuuacl,null,t3_2szyi5,null,t1_cnuuacl,null,t1_cnur7va,null,null,null,1424507062,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

Take smoking for example. Plenty of people smoke despite the fact they know it's killing them.  Banning smoking outright wouldn't go down very well at all, so instead, they choice remains as to whether you smoke, but there are lots of things within society that discourage it. Like banning it in pubs, putting nasty pictures on the packaging, running NHS Quit Smoking Campaigns etc.  These things are much more effective at getting people off ciggies of their own free will, than if they were just told they cannot smoke.

There's a lot of interesting research in how to lay out lunch halls and cafeterias too. So, rather than doing the Jamie Oliver school of banning everything unhealthy, there are ways to nudge, encourage, guide people to eating a healthier lunch of their own choosing.

null,false,AlphaShotZ,null,null,null,"Some people are confusing the situation by suggesting the terms playmaker and number 10 are position based. These terms refer to play styles, and this is the reason you can't say they're the same. Cesc could easily have fitted into the CAM spot, but that doesn't make him a number ten, similarly, Mata could never play CM, but that doesn't mean he was absent of skills in a playmaker.

A playmaker is one with skills of creation, to engineer an attack - Fabregas, Pirlo, Zidane.

A number 10 describes a player who, previously played off the striker in a 4-4-2 e.g. Gudjohnsen. Nowadays the skill set is focused on play directly engaging with the players around them, acting as an option with which all attacking activity goes through. Much more involved with the midfielders and strikers around them, they're the central hub. e.g. Mata, Sigurdsson, Hazard. This has caused some confusion in the difference because the current 4-2-3-1 means a playmaker can be either in the 2 or the 3.

null,false,nations21,null,null,null,"Well to give you an American prospective and hopefully a good view of the reasoning for this is really exposure and culture. I love Dr. Who but I've really only recently got into viewing it despite it being on Netflix for a long while, though thanks to Netflix I had access to the program. But the show is a British show, it's made in Britain and is broadcast on BBC. Not many Americans watch British movies/television (Americans are told British tv and we think Monty python, it's the only thing that comes to mind) but even fewer Americans have access to BBC. Now to go along with the popularity of Dr. Who in Britain you'd have to equate that to the level of popularity of maybe American idol here, but what I'd say it more relates to on a staying power and how heavily its ingrained in the culture I'd say it's up there with the Simpsons, south park, and Seinfeld in relation to what Americans would find to be our Dr. Who. Now take that into account as you see the rise in popularity on this side of the pond, Dr. Who has those shows along with the dense American culture that is heavy in dancing with washed up celebrities, reality shows of self appointed celebrity starved nobodies make fools of themselves for popularity, and crazy teenage sung song vampire soap opera whatever it is that is the new ten minute revolving fad. There's just so much saturation in the American market for the fan base to take root into the American cultural hierarchy, but getting into conventions is a good way for the fan base to get its feet wet into our American lifestyle. Conventions are actually starting to become big events that are a way to show you've made it in America, so it's actually like getting an ovation at Coachella. Though not a lot of Coachella goers I would think would go to a con, but that's just a naive opinion. But I hope this kinda sheds a light on why it isn't as big as it could be, though I can say word of mouth is getting stronger over here which accounts for a lot. It's definitely got me singing it's praises to the unprovoked Netflix dwellers. And I must say I did enjoy reading up on the prospective of someone on the other side of the coin.

What world are you living in? Topless men appear all over the media, constantly. Diet Coke has an entire advertising campaign based on women objectifying men. There's a tube ad campaign at the moment featuring a completely naked guy with his knob pixellated and two women staring at him.

&gt;Women are criminally underrepresented in most professions and you're naive if you think the page 3 issue isn't wrapped up in that. 

No, you are a reactionary looking for any justification for telling other women to cover up if you believe there is any link in that nonsense you just typed up.

This is like saying David Gandy being a successful male model explains why there are so few male nurses... in other words, it explains nothing at all. Both sexes have jobs based around objectification.

&gt; Call me judgmental or patronising but if the media objectifies women and promotes their worth in terms of sexuality rather than intelligence, and they aren't represented in positions of power, getting your tits out in the paper for middle aged men to gawp at probably isn't the most worthwhile thing you can do in that context.

OK you are judgemental and patronising. You have no care for what other people actually want or enjoy in life, and also make massive insulting assumptions about people.

Your assumption that Page 3 girls have no education is absolutely insulting to them. Why do you hate them so much that you think they are both stupid from lack of education &amp; brainwashed by society? What is it that makes you the one capable of seeing their foolishness?

For time immemorial, both men and women have enjoyed appreciating the beauty of men and women. To now claim that any attraction has wider implications and can't simply be wanted and  enjoyed is a sad statement on human sexuality. Prudery of the highest order.

That IS misogyny and is something the government should take a lead in opposing in the name of equality and of the freedom of each individual to lead the life they want, not according to some arbitrary gender norms that are a hangover from an age where women perhaps did need male protection from arbitrary violence.

I'd hold that the pace culture is changing at is a reflection of widening acceptance of equality for all in all aspects of life, and also of the technological revolution that allows people to be better educated and more aware of the way oppression works, and which allows people to better organise to resist oppression. People who believe this pace is too fast necessarily have to take regressive positions to protect the status quo, like opposing abortion rights or gay marriage, or historically votes for women in the UK or the civil rights movement in the USA (who's work is far from complete even if black people can vote now).

As for your point about racism and immigration, yes maybe it is lazy to call opponents of immigration racist, they often oppose white immigration from Eastern Europeans as much as immigration from Africa or the Middle East. However I have every right  to criticise those people as small-minded xenophobes. We live on one planet and are one humanity, why should the place I was born privilege me over somebody who has the discipline to save hard and try to get themselves here so they can share in the opportunities I myself was given at birth? The idealist in me says we should abolish all borders, the realist says we should do our best to accomodate those who do make it here and fight racism, xenophobia, alientation and discrimination to have a harmonious British society that is an example to other countries.

Not sexist at all to treat women differently to men... Get pregnant before your court hearing and you're off Scot free. What about equality?


Lets try these for size:

EC658 We will gradually establish legal ways for companies to be transformed into mutual organisations, such as consumer or worker cooperatives in specified circumstances if a sufficient majority of the relevant workers or customers agree. Existing shares will be converted into non-voting equity or loan stock. One important initial circumstance when this might be done is upon the sale of a small business or upon the death or retirement of the owner. Another initial application might be to football or other sporting clubs where a majority of the season ticket holders, supported by the wider local community, might want to bring a local club into mutual ownership. In the longer run we would envisage some process of this kind applying, with appropriate |safeguards, to all companies.

So that's Britain closed for business. Please invest in literally any other country. I really can't believe people would vote for this, the sheer stupidity and economic illiteracy is just staggering,  let alone put it in a serious manifesto.



EN261 We will cancel construction of new nuclear stations and nuclear power will not be eligible for government subsidy; the Green Party opposes all nuclear power generation and is particularly opposed to the construction of new nuclear power stations, electricity from which is likely to be significantly more expensive per unit supplied than other low-carbon energy sources, and too slow to deploy to meet our pressing energy needs. Cancellation will avoid the costs and dangers of nuclear energy and waste being passed on to future generations long after any benefits have been exhausted.

As long as the wind blows we'll be fine. And of course, all the poorest people are having to pay 12% on their fuel to subsidise wind power now, 30,000 people died to cold last year in Britain. Nuclear has recently been proven to be the cleanest and cheapest source of power, even with the clean ups. We should be investing heavily in nuclear, it is one of our largest exports. There are new, even cleaner nuclear technologies being developed, a thorium plant in France for one example, but the Greens would turn their back on this, so there goes a huge part of our economy again.

HO504 All new house building and change of use should be subject to open democratic planning approval. For larger schemes and all proposed developments on green field sites, this will require independent comprehensive environmental impact assessments.

MG205 Migration policies should not discriminate directly on grounds of race, colour, religion, political belief, disability, sex or sexual orientation. Preference should not be given to those with resources or desirable skills.

So much for a Green party.  Theyr'e opening the borders and building houses for everyone and anyone that fancies coming here. It doesn't matter if you're a religious zealot, or an illiterate goat herder, free houses for all. ...looks like they'll be built all over our greenbelt too. 

""Preference should not be given to those with resources or desirable skills."" Just let that sentence alone and it's implications sink in for a moment.  
 
PD302 On inspection, there is little or no threat of direct invasion of the UK by any nation. Commitment to a large standing army, a navy of large warships around our coastline, squadrons of fighter planes and a cripplingly expensive missile defence system is therefore unnecessary. Any threat of invasion that might arise in the future is so remote that realignment of the UK military and defence preparations would be possible long before any invasion occurred.

Better to have an army and not need it, than not have one and need it. Defence of country, the place where all our people and families live, is not something to be so blasé with. There was two world wars in the last 100 years. This is a reckless and extremely dangerous policy.

PD312 The Green Party is committed to the early conversion of economic, scientific and technological resources presently used to support the arms race, to socially useful and productive ends. Some military training areas should be decommissioned and used as nature reserves, with suitable provision for access by the public.

Wait, so we're meant to quickly ramp up war production even though our war industry would be dismantled.. Sound logic as always. 

I could carry on, I have more but I think you get the point. It's written by economic illiterates. It's hard for me to fathom how people get so removed from reality. It's like some idealogical 17 year old thoughts put on paper.

Sums it up nicely. You can go to the government for a license and go ahead and perform some work in the public good to repair broken sea defences, and end up convicted because of a technicality in the fucking paperwork...

With enough bullshit laws, everyone becomes a criminal, and with enough digging you can put anyone behind bars for the most innocent of things which most people would do themselves or support. Combine with selective enforcement and you can basically silence anyone you want, any time you want.

Instead we have what appears like an increase in Republican provocative parading (Castlederg, Dungiven etc), an increase in Republican memorial raising (playparks, Ti Chulainn, Crossmaglen) and all whilst simultaneously demanding less Orange Order parading, and the removal of symbols Sinn Fein choose to call ""unionist"".

I have a sense the word 'equality', like 'freedom', is being bandied about by Irish Republicans in the most Orwellian and selective ways.

You might even say the term ""equality"" is being used as a convenient term to pursue a political agenda of beating the spirit of those who take a different worldview to Sinn Fein.

I am against nuclear due to economics.  Hinkley is double the going rate guaranteed for 35 (!) years). This is absurd in and of itself with the Government not taking this on and doing it with record low interest rates.   The Green energy plan is very detailed with emphasis on reduction along with investment in multiple different renewables over a long period of time with emphasis on future funding.  As a side note, renewables are rapidly dropping in price and there have been major breakthroughs in just the last year in transport and storage.

We need more housing, and this is only party that is addressing issue.  Please share your better idea...   as for Immigration is clearly says it won't discriminate and preference to those with resources or desirable skills (not sure how this is opening border)

I don't disagree, but I think the whole 'you should know better' approach to dealing with these problems is misguided. There are many reasons that people do things which are self-harming - peer pressure is just one of them. The point is that these things do not happen in isolation. Being poor increases the risk of basically any decision you make, since virtually everything costs money. To me, with my current financial situation, the decision about when exactly to fill up my car is basically inconsequential - it's not really something I have to worry about. However, it wasn't always like this for me. I used to have to seriously weigh up when to fill up my car so as to have enough money in the bank for X,Y,Z bills to go out, which meant that I might need to buy a saver ticket for the train (2 trains, in fact) so that I didn't miss work, which also meant that I'd have to get the bus for shopping which meant I'd be able to carry less and so on and so forth.  Even HAVING a car in the first place is a luxury - but one which I wouldn't have been able to work without given my job.

Our decisions have consequences and they are not always immediately obvious, but the *risks* of those decisions is greater when you have less money. Waiting until after payday to fill up your car so that you don't get charged by your bank or miss a payment is a real problem, and it's just ONE thing that leads to a whole host of other decisions which need to be made, each carrying their own risk. Instead of telling people that they should just know better than to make bad decisions, we should be minimising the risk of making decisions which people with more money barely even have to think about.

&gt; You're right, we shouldn't. It's an enormous problem with our society and culture, and it needs to change. It won't be addressed from the top down because there's too much money to be made from it - it has to change from the bottom up. People need to be able to make a stand and say 'no, I'm not doing that'.

It needs to come from both directions, but fundamentally the whole thing is a people problem. We should structure our society and state so as to minimise the risk of decisions that people make. It probably means a greater budget for welfare, and it probably means increasing prices for some things, but we should always be conscious of *why* we are accepting those things: a rising tide lifts every boat.",null,0,null,1421760021,null,0,false,0,cnuvoyf,null,t3_2sx7bj,null,t1_cnuvoyf,null,t1_cnutktr,null,null,null,1424506337,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

If you can't charge enough to offer costs, you take other avenues. You lower quality or quantity to match the price cap, or change business model.

Houses will be split up into flats, Anything above bare minimum will be pared back. Some may even investigate turning properties into small hotels, etc.

If I can't charge more for my 3 bedroom house than that other guy can charge for a 1 bedroom flat, why the hell should I give away those extra rooms for free? If I can't repurpose them into another flat, office space, etc. I'll just use them myself.

And how about the other house I rent out that's kept to extremely high standards with high quality furniture, etc. to people willing to pay for a nice short term property? Fuck it, all that good furniture is going on ebay, the house is being split into flats, and I'm putting in planning permission for a few bedsits in that big garden the current tenants like so much.

Even if you decide to change nothing, you're certainly going to give less of a shit about problems for something you're getting £400/month for that you were getting £750/month for previously. Oh you lost power? Fuck off I'm reading the newspaper, call back when I've got nothing to do.

Good luck finding a rental property in a nice central location - those will be sold or otherwise repurposed for more lucrative purposes, and you'll end up with rental properties wherever the land is cheapest.

The potential for unintended consequences is pretty severe. At the very least standards will fall, average property size will fall, the high end of the rental market will divebomb (need to rent a house for you and your 7 kids? Good luck!), and there will be less rental space available overall.

Local price standards with tiered pricing depending on property size, quality, location, etc. is a bare minimum for any sane ""rental cap"" system.

Come on, it's pretty clear that many aspects of gender roles are culture-specific.  In some cultures, men are emotional and women are stoic - in others it's the other way round.  In some cultures, men go out to work and women stay at home - in others different kinds of work are shared far more equally.  In some cultures, women wear make-up and men don't - in others it's the other way round.  Some languages have hardly any gender-specific words.  In some cultures there are even more than two distinct genders.  There has been a vast amount of academic work looking at gender roles in different societies - if you aren't even going to glance at it, then you shouldn't expect your opinions on the subject to be taken seriously.

&gt; There is also a difference between being racist and against mass immigration.

OK, but in my experience the former is usually the motivation for the latter.  Surely you would have to accept that there is a great deal of overlap between racists and opponents of immigration?

Also hosted the **Brit Awards** before he starred on Doctor Who.(British equivalent of the Grammy Awards) 

even featured on world cup single that reached Number 1 in the charts in the UK.. etc

So more money comes out of my pocket for my health care, no thanks. And I won't be entitled to the best care because I'm not rich.

&gt; Some of those systems require the patient to pay some cash too, whilst others don't.

So poor people will forgo care then.

&gt; Funding from taxation also means that the NHS is linked to every social issue. It means that every lifestyle choice that is frowned up needs to be regulated ""because it costs the NHS"" instead of the patient seeing the costs and being free to regulate themselves.

Public health agencies everywhere are linked to social issues, that's what they do. The second sentence is just glibertarian emotobabble.

&gt; The point is that not everyone who is against gay marriage, as an example, hates gay people.

It's very easy to buy into widely-held hateful positions without actually feeling particularly hateful.  Look at the Catholic Church: they teach that anyone who is in a same-sex relationship is necessarily an unrepentant sinner who will go to hell, and they have actively supported some quite extreme anti-gay laws and policies, but they very strongly object to the idea that they ""hate"" gay people, and in fact insist that they ""love"" us.

Every application for university-based training, School Direct salaried and School Direct unsalaried goes through UCAS (www.ucas.co.uk) so nip over there. There are two cycles, Apply 1 and Apply 2. Apply 1 opened for initial applications back in November, and most programmes appear to go on a first-come first-served basis. You apply for three programmes simultaneously in Apply 1. If you don't get offered a place in Apply 1, or turn down anything you do get offered, you automatically go into Apply 2, where you put applications in one at a time. You can apply for any mix of programme type that you like or any subject that you want to teach. Providers generally expect you to have about ten days experience in a school, though different ones say different things about what they're looking for. Apply 2 stays open through until September 2015.

Bear in mind that every PGCE programme in England and Wales also needs you to have passed Governmental Skills Tests in Literacy and Maths. No ifs, ands or buts, unfortunately. It's a pain, but not too terrible.

[Teach First](http://graduates.teachfirst.org.uk) is a whole new scheme of its own where you can train (and be paid) for two years in a low-income school and get QTS (Qualified Teacher Status) at the end of it. On the other side of the coin is the new [HMC scheme](http://www.hmcteachertraining.org.uk/) where you can train for two years, get QTS and a PGCE and be paid in an Independent school. You apply directly to the schools through that scheme rather than go through UCAS. If you want to teach maths or a science subject there's loads of opportunities. Hope that helps!

Sure, I suppose if you were taking it to the hyperbolic extreme. I won't bother responding to the exaggeration about putting people in camps etc.

But an investigative journalist is much more likely to try and access confidential information than your average citizen, right?

It's the same if you work for ANY organisation with any sort of secrets. They always tell employees not to talk to the press, and to watch out for people approaching you in your personal time too.

&gt;We rely on Journalists to break story's that highlight illegal and immoral action so that we can improve our society

I agree. But let's not also forget that journalists aren't saints. They have their own motives and they are selective about what they release and when (see the Guardian and WP with the Snowden leaks, cherry picking bits and pieces at convenient times). It's wise to view everything with healthy scepticism.

While I believe that mass collection of email communication is wrong, this headline is also very misleading. It's fairly sensible of GCHQ to warn employees about journalists and to consider them a ""threat"".

In fact they show it as slightly cheaper than onshore wind (which I find remarkable), and significantly cheaper than solar PV or coal.

Where's your ""valid financial argument"" against nuclear?

&gt; Note that Renewables are coming down very fast 

The cost of solar PV is certainly going to come down, but right now it's not competitive in the dingy UK. In a few years time, panel prices will come down and we should start enthusiastically investing in it.

Wind costs are *not* going to come down significantly. The technology is already pretty mature so there are no great extra efficiencies to be had, and *good sites for onshore wind will start to run out.* As developers are forced to build their wind turbines on less and less favourables sites, the levelised cost will start to creep up.",null,0,null,1421761966,null,0,false,0,cnuwcrr,null,t3_2sx1xu,null,t1_cnuwcrr,null,t1_cnuua6r,null,null,null,1424506031,null,1,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,1,null

Even the SRS boogeyman is in two minds on the subject of porn and sex work, but generally falls in the liberal side.

Sure, there are going to be sex-negative feminists, but that's hardly exclusive to feminism. Every movement has people with differences of opinion.

Allen can work in tight spaces with the ball at his feet better than Lucas, but that's more of a quality needed from an attacking mid as opposed to a defensive one. Lucas usually moves the ball forward quickly, especially when we've just won possession (which is the best time to move the ball forward in a counter attacking side), Allen is decent for this too but he's less likely to win the ball in midfield. Allen's ideal use is in a midfield three with a defensive mid partner (Lucas) and a pure box to box (Hendo) where he can move to receive the ball from Lucas and push it on to attacking players as well as support Hendo to be able to switch play and pull strings from a little bit deeper when we're in attacking positions. Think of it as Barcelona's style from three years ago or so with Hendo being Iniesta, Allen being Xavi and Lucas being Busquets. It's not quite the same as Busquets pushed higher than Lucas would and Iniesta had more interplay with Messi than Henderson would with our strikers, but they're very similar.

Here is a vague summary from memory of our issues:

- Very slow to respond to emails
- Usually asked to call us back when we phoned and calls weren't returned promptly
- We were new to Edinburgh and they offered us no advice on pricing or areas, and were keen to distance themselves from any questions I had that weren't strictly ""their business"".
- They offered us ZERO advice on making an offer. They didn't tell us anything about the property being sold in terms of the pricing strategy. They also didn't look at other things which were similar and had sold recently......A service I now know most companies will do as they have access to the sales achieves on ESPC. Basically if it didn't directly relate to a piece of paperwork they needed to get us to buy something they weren't interested.
- Solicitor dragged her heels on exchanging contracts and was arguing with the sellers solicitor over minor details which were clearly already covered when I took the time to read through all the correspondence they were sending me copies of. Issues were finally resolved by me going into warners with everything printed out and demanding to speak to someone more senior than the solicitor. You can be sure things got resolved once I'd done that.

May I also point out that we are two well educated fully employed professionals who were buying a property without needing a mortgage and with no existing property so extremely relaxed and flexiable on dates. I don't think it could have been any easier for warners and they still did a terrible job.

A lot of these things weren't as apparent as problems until it came to buying our new place this year. After dealing with another company I was just left thinking ""man warners are terrible this is SO much better"".

The only pro I can say about warners is that if you want a mortgage with HSBC then you don't get charged extra fees if you use them.... however they are still more expensive overall that some of the other companies, but it does mean one less lawyer getting involved if you use them.

I do see by viewing their website today that the person we dealt with has since left the company, so perhaps I can't condemn the company as a whole...  but of course all I can speak about is my personal experience and this is what it was!",null,0,null,1421763892,null,0,1421769098,0,cnux33f,null,t3_2t15pk,null,t1_cnux33f,null,t1_cnuu3bk,null,null,null,1424505687,null,1,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,1,null

You second link is about *offshore* wind. That's relatively new, and I'm sure prices will come down significantly. But it's currently massively more expensive than onshore wind, so it's not going to be anything more than a curiosity for a while yet. It also suffers from the same problem as onshore wind - there is not an infinite supply of suitable sites.

(If we can get deep offshore wind to be cost competitive, then that *would* be a game changer. But that's just science fiction at the moment.)

Your first link is about *solar* and wind. Solar prices are certainly coming down, but I'm not sure what their reasoning is re: wind. They mention subsidies. Also, I don't think the US is a very mature market for wind power, so it may be that they are (were) behind the curve when it comes to manufacturing techniques.

It would be if I were exaggerating but I am not. If you have read Karl Marx you will know he believed in the same kind of ideals as this policy contains.

What's amusing now is the way you have gone through and selected various meaningless phrases within the policy to try to hide the overall meaning of it. Which is the state will seize property and give it to the workers.

|Gradually establish, 

ok it won't happen overnight, so what. They will still seize property.

|in specified circumstances if a sufficient majority of the relevant |workers or customers agree

Who is going to turn down the opportunity to take something from someone else and receive a portion of it for free? Hardly anyone.

|One important initial circumstance when this might be done is upon the sale of a small business or upon the death or retirement of the owner.

They must be dead or near death before personal property is pried from the deceased persons family.


|Another initial application might be to football or other sporting clubs where a majority of the season ticket holders, supported by the wider local community, might want to bring a local club into mutual ownership.with appropriate |safeguards,

They are also planning on seizing football clubs and handing them to the 'people'. 'with appropriate |safeguards' means nothing.

You can try to dress it up however you like. The policy clearly states that they will take dead or retiring peoples companies and property, ask 'the people' if they want some of it, then divide it up amongst them.

My reasoning for this is twofold. 

- They are cheaper than quite a lot of the others (Even if your mortgage company charges you a fee for some of their lawyers time it still works out cheaper)
- They are dealing with buying and selling a LOT of properties in Edinburgh, especially in the lower price brackets and so will be able to give you some good advice and personal experience about everything.

I've now bought twice. The first time I used warners to avoid paying a fee to the mortgage company (warners are on HSBC's approved list of representatives). We had a terrible time with them. They were extremely unhelpful, slow to act on our requests, refused to give us advice on several things, refused to advise us on bidding and I'd never use them again.

However I've just finished buying a place using mov8 and have nothing but praise for them. They always answer their phones and are very quick to respond to emails. We got some good advise from them and they were happy to sit on the phone for 30+ minutes going through espc website with me and looking at similar sales to the one I was bidding on from the past few years, how much they went for and what my best bidding strategy was.

I can also somewhat recommend http://www.haddenrankin.com/ having only heard good things about them, but neverr having used them myself.

He has different ways to get the ball there, sure, but its almost always a short, horizontal or backwards pass unless he's got a friendly player checking back to him from a short distance to receive the ball.  Lucas will attempt the ball, though perhaps not always get it inch perfect. Lucas will play longer as well, he's not limited to the players right next to him. 

Allen slows down our rapid transition play more than any other midfielder we have. He is made for a possession side that takes a methodical approach, not one that looks to skip entire sections of the pitch at once to advance the ball fast. I've said I like Allen at the base of the diamond or as the holding player in a 4-3-3 before, and that's because he will have 2 players to exert physical presence through the middle with him as well as a wealth of options to recycle the ball into our guys who can play forward better. His nice possession play from deep is really good in this setup, which he sctually showcased nicely right when he got to Liverpool as the holding player in a 4-3-3 where he looked one of our best players often before his shoulder injury. 

In a 2 man midfield Allen wins the ball and either looks for his partner or a CB as there's no one else close to him. If one of the AMs drops that deep to pick the ball up from him then we are already a man light in our counter attack. He's more isolated here and asked to do things that simply don't suite his game. He's also got almost no physical presence and in a modern 2 man midfield that's a very big deal. You have to have the ability to impose yourself on players as you challenge them and Allen isn't so much one to do that. He's nippy and hard working but he's not about to muscle someone off the ball in a 50/50 challenge or win a physical battle in the air.

This sort of logic is bullshit. The English game is growing in popularity. More Americans watched the final day of the premier league last season than Brits. Almost no American will have a connection to a team, so they have to pick one based on affinity, players, history, etc. And what club has a better story, tradition, and legacy than Liverpool?

There is no need to provide market incentives to people's health: if they are not persuaded by earlier death, then their work ethic/propensity to pay will not factor into the equation. The NHS does not give everything for free, and you can access faster care if you pay.

The US has a market-based healthcare system and they have the second worst obesity rate in the entire world. Does the threat of poverty when critical medical needs arise magically make them healthy by the power of incentives? No.

No-one likes to see wastage like that, but when you consider that the NHS is the most cost effective advanced healthcare system, you have to make the admission that the upside of having 'wastages' (**which they are not, at all**) is that you also have a system that minimises costs in so many other ways and resultantly provides fantastic value for money.

There are issues with healthcare provision - no doubt. We need to do more to address the volume of recklessly irresponsible and burdensome morbidly obese patients coming through the system. We need to address the elephant in the room of Geriatric care. We need to address a plethora of issues.

My advice is to keep your mind and options open. You can live in London, and commute to other towns outside of London.  Commuting out of London is good because the trains are usually nowhere near as full, plus you get to come home to London every night and enjoy the nightlife.

So, seeing as drugs are already illegal, there isn't much more they could do, other than setting up and advertising support programs for kicking the habit.  However, to reach a wide enough audience, that would be putting signs (whether TV or Radio ads or something else, because the people that are really in need probably don't have much access to media) in places where a lot of people want to ignore or pretend there isn't a problem.

Not that I am saying that shouldn't do things like this, or that we should ignore drugs altogther, there definitely needs to be a shift it how it's handled, but the sort of things I've just mentioned would be a hard sell, especially where public money is concerned.*^2

The vast majority of houses in the UK are fitted with ring mains, which are a way of delivering more power using thinner wire. They came about after WWII and the high costs of metal during rebuilding. They are the reason all our plugs have to have fuses in, as a ring main is capable of providing a lot more current than the plug and cables are able to handle. I believe most ring mains, theoretically, could provide 32A out of a standard three pin wall socket. As the cables are on rated, at most, to provide 13A this is a massive fire risk should you have something that is short circuiting and drawing far more current than it should! Hence the fuses.

So, if you wanted to switch to a standard European plug and socket system you'd need to have every single new build house wired up in a different way. You'd need to develop new regulations, then test them, then train all the thousands of electricians who install in to a new houses (lets be honest, it would have to be new homes - you don't want to go through rewiring old houses!), then deal with the consequences when someone gets it wrong...

I fancy our chances of scoring a few. Spurs showed that if you have players with pace against Terry, Cahill and Ivanovic you can expose them. If Sterling is indeed playing up top I hope we play the ball to him as quickly as possible. If we can get him and Markovic in behind Matic and running at the Chelsea defence then we're laughing.

Dealing with Fabregas is the key to shutting down Chelsea. The game in October Henderson shadowed him all game and effective made the 2 of them redundant, with Hendo hopefully playing in the middle I doubt that'll happen this time.

Unlike a true cooperative, **members usually do not contribute to the capital of the company by direct investment, but derive their right to profits and votes through their customer relationship.**




EC658 We will gradually establish legal ways for companies to be transformed into mutual organisations, such as consumer or worker cooperatives in specified circumstances if a sufficient majority of the relevant workers or customers agree. Existing shares will be converted into non-voting equity or loan stock. One important initial circumstance when this might be done is upon the sale of a small business or upon the death or retirement of the owner.

The fanboy's concept of the ""fake fangirl"" whose fickle attention can only be held by a young male fantasy figure is insulting as hell. Again: some people of both sexes won't like any given change in a TV program and will leave. 

There is a world of difference between seeing ""complaints about Capaldi and the season overall""-- *on an overwhelmingly male platform, at that*-- and saying that these complaints are happening because female viewers miss ""fan girling over daydreams of running away with a dashing handsome Doctor to save the world.""

&gt;

&gt;A __mutual__, __mutual organization__, or __mutual society__ is an [organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization) (which is often, but not always, a [company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company_(law\)) or [business](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business)) based on the principle of mutuality. Unlike a true [cooperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative), members usually do not contribute to the [capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_(economics\)) of the company by direct investment, but derive their right to profits and votes through their [customer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer) relationship. [*[dubious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Disputed_statement) – discuss*] A mutual organization or society is often simply referred to as *a mutual*.

&gt;A mutual exists with the purpose of raising [funds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funding) from its membership or customers (collectively called its *members*), which can then be used to provide common services to all members of the organization or society. A mutual is therefore owned by, and run for the benefit of, its members - it has no external [shareholders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder) to pay in the form of [dividends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend), and as such does not usually seek to maximize and make large [profits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_(accounting\)) or [capital gains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_gain). Mutuals exist for the members to benefit from the services they provide and often do not pay [income tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax). 

&gt;Profits made will usually be re-invested in the mutual for the benefit of the members, although some profit may also be necessary in the case of mutuals for [internal financing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_financing) to sustain or grow the organization, and to make sure it remains safe and secure.

Ireland at that time was recovering from war. Two wars, in fact, a war of independence followed by a civil war. Plus, Ireland's industrial heartland in the north east had been partitioned off. 1920s Ireland was an underdeveloped, war-torn, agriculturally-dependent state. None of that applies to Scotland.

This article says nothing about UKIP being for Private Health Insurance, quite the opposite in fact. 

&gt;The Ukip leader was forced to back down and declare his party’s support for a state-funded health service last November ..............., he admitted he had not carried his Ukip colleagues with him.

&gt;I triggered a debate within Ukip that was outright rejected by my colleagues, so I have to accept that. As time goes on, this is a debate that we’re all going to have to return to.


Gasp shock horror, You lot all demonise UKIP and Farage for having sensible debates on topics.


The NHS is struggling as it is, what Farage says is correct, as the population age, in the decades to come we will need to find ways of paying for this.  To ignore any view in a debate, regardless of how unpopular it is, is ignorant.

Having worked inside the department for the best part of a year, but not being an indoctrinated employee of it, I have to say they've not done too badly at all. It's certainly a lot less wasteful than it used to be, and actual care is taken to make things usable. They take their user research a lot more seriously than a lot of companies do, with a bunch of analysts and researchers from, for example, Canonical (Ubuntu) on board.

It is actually quite impressive to watch how some of the projects are unfolding. There's still a lot to be done, and still things that could be improved, but the entire idea is brilliant, and other governments are falling over themselves to take leaves out of our book.

Secondly you are incorrect about the reason it was in breach of the code. In fact the ""rip it up on empty streets"" aspect was dismissed, however:

&gt;It did rule that the phrases ‘drink fast, live fast’ and ‘we believe faster is better’ could encourage the consumer to drink the product rapidly. Consequently, the product was found by the Panel to be in breach of Code paragraphs 3.2 (b) and (g).

Which I think is absolutely spot on. There's a reason we regulate what alcohol advertisers are allowed to say. All this - and their stupid #sorrynotsorry response says to me is that they don't give a crap about their customers' health.

I don't care where the profits go. A company with £18 million turnover, producing 120k bottles a month with bottles in most major supermarkets is not a small company. No it's not a world-striding colossus but it's big enough to know better. It's big enough to take *seriously* its responsibilities related to health.

&gt;In no way are they trying to have this image of a struggling outsiders. They're simply trying to bring decent beer to the UK. 

This is exactly what they're doing:

&gt;Unfortunately, the Portman Group is a gloomy gaggle of killjoy jobsworths, funded by navel-gazing international drinks giants. 

&gt;we have never given a second thought to any of the grubby newspeak they disseminate periodically.

&gt;We sincerely hope that the sarcasm of this message fits the Portman Group criteria of responsible use of humour.


It's a fucking childish response, for two middle-aged businessmen to issue. Alcoholism is a major killer in this country. The rules are there for a reason. BrewDog threw a hissy fit because they couldn't get away with their rebellious punk marketing, and their response was puerile and stupid. Feel free to keep drinking their Kool-Aid and laughing at their uproarious anti-establishment stunts if you want, but pretty much everyone in the industry knows them to be what they are: ridiculous, attention-seeking twats who go on endlessly about how punk and cool they are.

Your experience in bar work is a good start and so is your ambition. Being young doesn't matter, success in business is to do with knowledge (which comes with experience and research), a good idea and a good team.

It sounds like you need to do more research into the idea as you currently don't have the fundamentals (rental/cost of product/cost of staff/price that you could charge) in your grasp.

The above should give you a direction on where to go in terms of starting a business (ie research more and gain more experience, think about the team that you are going to build).

Now to answer how you make a lot of money to start this thing...

If you want to be successful in bar work then stay in the bar work scene. To make a big margin (ie lots of money) you need to do events, hire artists/performers and get a large volume of people to come down an charge for tickets. I did this at university and invested £25 up front for wristbands and by the end saw a total revenue of £100k (£40k or so of which was profit) so this is possible.

If you can become successful in events save that money, be frugal on your personal expenditure and use the money you save and the experience to help you with launching your sports bar.

Travelling is piss cheap under certain circumstances. 

1) Quality of Life: If you don't mind sleeping on a floor in a strangers house that you just met outside a market then accommodation is practically nothing. 

2) Time: If you have no set time to return home or anything pre-booked then you can do whatever you like, when you like. That flight travelling across Nicaragua is £300 and takes an hour; there's also a bus that takes 3 days and costs £50 but is a shithole. You go for the latter. Time isn't valuable anymore, the longer the better. And it's three extra nights you can sleep on a bus and not have to find somewhere else. Better still, hitchhike. 

3) Food and Cleanliness: If you're comfortable wearing the same shirt for three days before finding a stream to wash it in then you're sorted. Happy to eat one meal a day and get by on street food? Tonnes of money saved. 

£15 a day is easily doable in a lot of countries to cover food/drink/activities/travel/accommodation. ",null,0,null,1421771595,null,0,false,0,cnv0wia,null,t3_2t1hff,null,t1_cnv0wia,null,t1_cnv0omn,null,null,null,1424503905,null,2,false,SaintsFC,t5_2tboa,2,null

null,false,Vorsa,null,null,null,"I worked in the pub trade for many years and left to go back to university. I have one bit of advice for you that I'll expand upon...

You're taking this far too lightly. 

I'll pull apart your post and feed back on the things you bring up. 

&gt; I'm 18 and in my final year of A levels

First problem: You're too young and inexperienced. 

Running your own gaff isn't a case of ""order beer, sell beer"", it's stocktaking, profit analysis, product research, supplier management, waste reduction and a million other things... These are all things you will learn staying in the industry and being promoted up the chain of command. Assistant/bar Manager position will teach you the intricacies of the front of house, but then you'll still lack any sort of experience in the behind-the-scenes running of a business. 

You're 18 and will have less than 1 year of experience simply pulling pints. You're absolutely no where near experienced enough to open your own business yet. 

&gt; will likely finish with half decent grades but not applying for university... what sort of temporary jobs can I get where I work a shit tonne save up money and start my own business.

Everything you've posted just shows that you're rushing into this without thinking things through. 

There is no work people could pull in a ""Shit tonne"" of hours and save money for people with completely minimal qualifications. There are low pay jobs that grant overtime, of course, but you have living costs to worry about, and that will absorb nearly everything you earn. 

Want a way to increase the chance you will earn enough money to save for your own pub? Go and get a degree. Use your ""half decent grades"" to get a business studies degree. Work part time in a pub and save as much money as you can through uni. Use your business degree as leverage in getting management/assistant management positions at different establishments. 

Your current plan stinks of rushing head first into something you're completely naive about. 

&gt; I have done so research and there is no sports bar within 40miles

Why are there no sports bars? There is likely a reason for this. 

The country is littered with huge breweries that open managed houses anywhere they think there is profit. If there isn't already a bar focused on this, what makes you think the town needs one? What will a sports bar bring to this place that the pub you work in doesn't already? Is this something the place needs (which will turn a profit) or something you want (which wont)? 

&gt; First off I would like to know how much it would cost to get started up as just a regular bar at first and then grow it into a sports bar.

In your mind, what is the difference between a regular pub and a sports bar? In my mind.... Not much. Maybe what's on TV? Couple more pool tables. 

Setting up your ""Regular bar"" is nearly the entire cost of setting up a ""Sports bar"". The cost of which depends on a hundred thousand factors... Supplier distance, property value, line installation, refurbishments, staff, building a bar, preparing a kitchen... None of this Reddit will be able to give you advice on. 

&gt; I currently work as a bartender at a local pub and have taken an interest in helping increase the sales at the pub. So I have at least a small bit of experience.

Absolutely no where near enough. I worked behind bars for 4 years before I got my first break into management and until I did, I had absolutely no idea what it entails. I didn't know the first thing about stock taking, POS maintenance, profit reports, ordering, supply management... Nothing. and I'm willing to bet my shoes you don't either. 

This isn't stuff you just pick up. You'll need training. You'll need to do it for YEARS to come across the issues that you'll need to learn to fix. 

What do you do if a CO2 tank is leaking? There's no line pressure on one of the pumps, what could it be? Several barrels of bitter won't pull clear, you need to get them replaced before the upcoming bank holiday weekend else you're out of one of your best selling ales (as well as having hundreds of pounds of worthless stock sitting around)... What do you do? GP of the kitchen is in the tank, how do you approach increasing it? Is waste being managed correctly? does it need reducing? How? 

You need tens of years more experience before you're ready to go it alone. 

&gt; Ok I think that's all of it,

No, it's really not. 

Keep the dream, it's a great one to strive for because it's doable... just realise you're not there yet. Go get a degree and work part time. Get into the industry and work as management for a bunch of years. Get a Shit tonne of experience before even thinking about contacting a bank about loans. 

You're 18. Even if you spend 15 years working towards your goal, working normal pub jobs and management positions and saving every penny, you'll only be 33 when you get your own gaff, and that would be one hell of an achievement for someone in their early 30's.

Cabaye and Schneiderlin are not DMs in the same mould as Lucas or Fernando. They are CMs who have played as deep lying playmakers who could play in the role Gerrard was asked do to when he played there. They won't break up the play or provide the defensive cover that Lucas does.

Gonalons is a good player but I haven't seen enough of him to compare him to Lucas. I can't see Lyon selling him for less than 20m anyway. Kondogbia is a great talent but Monaco aren't going to let him go on the cheap either. I think he's more of a box to box midfielder in the Ramires mould from what I've seen.

Each British party has its own internal arrangements with regard to drafting manifestos. Some have democratic drafting/ratification processes for their election manifestos (the Liberal Democrats and Greens, most notably), but most don't have anything of the sort- policy is put together through informal lobbying processes within the party itself and by the party elite/research departments. 

There's no central legislation concerning what a party *must* do about drafting their manifesto- they're private organisations with their own processes.

He has a nice style-when it works, and the amount of injuries suffered under martinez is bewildering compared to Moyes; I'm not suggesting this but for me it has looked like Martinez starts players injured. Also this can be kinda seen with the departure of the Head of Medicine, reading his interview from last year before th Man U game, you could tell hismphilopshy was kind of; if they are injured they are not fit to play- maybe Martinez has different views.

Either way Martinez hasn't built strongly enough on Moyes' squad, and the general consensus after the last few games is that he has lost it. I like him but I am feeling that a change maybe needed if he doesn't change soon.

It is almost unheard of for any team to not have a few injuries at some point and we shall see how they cope under those circumstances, my bet is no where near as well as we have. Add to this the fact that Chelsea are known for dropping points against weaker opposition.

Both times we have won the league in recent years, we have been written off around this time and have still won it. 

Chelsea's key players may well stay fit and they may win every game and if they do, credit to their players and their backroom staff who have kept them match fit. But anyone who says we are out of it, IN JANUARY, are deluded.

The definition of country I'm using (from the OED) doesn't. What definition are you using?

&gt;These questions show that whatever we want to call the various parts, the UK is not a country of countries or a state of states.

These question only make sense if your definition of ""country"" is ""the people who live there are its citizens"" and ""it has a foreign policy"" and ""it can give you a passport for travel outside its borders"". But I don't know any definition of country that has those as part of it.

&gt; I'd argue that it's a state comprised of four countries. This isn't just semantics, because the two are different things and carry different weight.

You're argument wouldn't go far, the word state can also be used to apply to England,Scotland,Wales or Northern Ireland.

at no point in the video does Nigel say anything about privatising the NHS.

a quote from the page.

Mr Farage used his column in The Independent to insist that his party supports a state-funded NHS free at the point of use. He said: “I don’t want to hand faceless private-sector companies control of our health service. We’ve now have two successive governments who have done that and it is clear that it doesn’t work.”

THe supporters of NIgel Farage, are going to have to be very careful about reading the news about him.

Litterally all newspapers in the UK are backed by the 3 main parties, and I will expect a lot of shit throwing agaisnt UKip in the run up to the electonions.

Once again. it's all lies.

2. Target Constituencies

There is still a huge amount of work to be done in pushing these over the line and electing an MP, but they represent the next best hope.

Norwich South

Bristol West

 

3. Advanced Constituencies 

These constituencies are well on the path to creating a very strong local base from which to build. This general election will be about developing that foundation and increasing capacity for future elections.

Solihull

Sheffield Central

Liverpool Riverside

Oxford East

St Ives

 

4. Development Constituencies

The aim for these constituencies will be to fight the general election within the context of preparing for future local gains. In order to develop further these constituencies need to break out of a single ward and build more solid local foundations for future general election campaigns.

Reading East

Holborn and St Pancras

York Central

 

5. Supported Constituencies

These constituencies took part in the process and demonstrated the ambition and willingness to grow both their presence and electoral impact. Many of these constituencies will buddy up with more developed local parties and benefit from shared knowledge and best practice.

* Brown boots. Any shoe place or online. This might be the more expensive upgrade, so pick a pair that you'd wear for more than just the costume. ~$60 but can be less if needed and you're a shopper, or more if you want a good pair of boots (I bought Doc Martens - need the comfort when walking 10mil in a weekend around the con.)

* Brown belt that matches the shoes. ~$10-$20 - various places.

null,false,JimReilly,null,null,null,"It is incredibly difficult to tell if a goalkeeper who is in their teens will go on to become top class (there are some exceptions like Buffon and a few others in Italy. Perhaps they do things differently?). 

Goalkeepers tend to develop much later and it is difficult to tell if they are any good from youth games. Most of the keepers who go on to become premier league quality tend to have played a lot of football in smaller leagues where clubs are more likely to put faith in a youth keeper for financial reasons. Guzan had 92 apps in the MLS, Cech had two seasons in the Czech republic before playing 70 games in France, Courtois (who is still young of course) played 41 times for Genk before another 111 league apps for Atleti, Howard played 88 times in the MLS, Joe Hart had 54 appearances as a Shrewsbury player before he went to City (he got lucky that City need some English players which is why they put up with him).

It is rare that a goalkeeper will have a few years in a development league or sitting on the bench and then make an impact at a top club (which can happen for outfield players). I don't think there is any intention that the young keepers we have like Ward and Vigouroux will ever play for the first team but they are needed for the u21 squads.

The two keepers you mentioned Perin and Leno I think will become great goalkeepers. Both are young and playing regular football in the champions league. I also believe both are better than Mignolet and Jones and if we did buy someone like that next season it would be to take the number one shirt not get loaned out.

* [The shitstorm over the council budget](http://www.localgovernmentexecutive.co.uk/news/brighton-hove-agrees-budget-after-dropping-planned-475-council-tax-hike)

[Current Green policies on their website](http://policy.greenparty.org.uk/) 

**The Highlights:**

* ""devolve economic power to the lowest appropriate level""
* ""on economic growth to cease, and allow zero or negative growth to be feasible without individual hardship should this be necessary on the grounds of sustainability."" 

Economic growth in the long term has meant more jobs, more money and prevented us from shitting in our gardens. What are the advantages of negative-growth? I happen to like the entrepreneurship a confident growing economy could encourage.

* To facilitate the responsible drinking of alcohol by both adults and young people, the Green Party would encourage the option of serving alcohol in smaller measures and require suppliers to provide accurate information about the unit alcohol content.

If I want a beer, I want a good beer. 

* Extend Inheritance Tax to the living. Tax on gifts while the giver is alive, want to give your child his first car, or a family wedding ring, or assist with mortgage?  Pay up or be rich enough to afford a decent accountant. 
* [Being a member of al-Qaeda, the IRA and other currently proscribed terrorist groups will no longer be a criminal offence](http://policy.greenparty.org.uk/pd.html), and ""address the desperate motivations that lie behind many atrocities labelled ""terrorist.""

If you pick up a gun, set bombs, set a knife on throats and kill innocent men, women and children to further your political agenda, your motivations are out of evil and wickedness rather than desperation.

* Stupid policy on nuclear power. [Thankfully some people in the green party recognise it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/2fxl9p/green_party_a_nuclear_debate/)

Some useful reading from UkPolling report:

&gt;Support varies between 11 percent from Ashcroft and just 3 percent from Populus. For the very low scores from Populus and ComRes there are at least clear methodological reasons: Populus downweight voters who identify as Green supporters quite heavily, while in ComRes’s online polls they appear to have added a much stricter turnout filter to Green and UKIP voters since they started prompting for UKIP. At the other end of the scale Lord Ashcroft’s polls have consistently tended to show a higher level of support for parties outside the traditional big three, but the reasons for this are unclear.

null,false,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,null,"&gt;So what, we should let old people die because it's cheaper?

I think that's pretty much where the Conservative and UKIP line of thinking leads, to be honest.  When you hear, ""Insurance based healthcare."" doesn't that make you think of the American system?  Because, ""If you can't afford healthcare, you don't **get** healthcare"" is pretty much what that personifies.

I'm pretty sure that this will be an unpopular opinion and it's certainly an ugly one, but I believe that it would be better and fairer to say to the old, ""You have to die because it's cheaper!"" than it is to continue to tax and to economically punish and to bleed out the young in order to pay for those benefits, which the younger generations will never get.

That said, what I think we should do is to increase taxes on the wealthy **a lot**.  At a certain point I think those taxes could even potentially exceed 100%.  The reason I say this is that the economic system we have promotes monopolies.  Most people know that Laffer argued that if the tax rate is 100% you get no tax, because why would anyone do any work, when they lose all the profits?  But here's the thing:  Say you earn £50m and after this you pay 110% tax.  Instead of continuing to try to develop your endless monopoly you stop and this leaves space for other businesses to grow.  *(The reason I suggest more than 100% is precisely to punish over-growth.  If it was merely 100% you might decide that it's worth continuing, since it kills potential competitors off.)*

Another option is what Picketty argues for is the taxation of capital wealth.  This is a pretty good idea, in that if you earn a huge amount of money and you spend it all you're a huge boon to the economy.  If you earn a huge amount of money and hoard it, or move it offshore you're probably an economic liability.

Regardless of the way you try to solve it...  What isn't viable is to let the old consume a disproportionate amount of GDP while at the same time pointing the blame at the unemployed, or the disabled, or immigrants.  *(Insert which ever group you fancy blaming here, really.  (And yeah, I can see that you could read this as my chosen 'blame group' is the old, but I'd be happy to be proven wrong. The important thing is that we need a root cause analysis to find the problems and then to fix those.  Not the usual anti-benefits-scrounger, anti-immigrant witch hunts.))*",null,0,null,1421775565,null,0,false,0,cnv37jm,null,t3_2t172j,null,t1_cnv37jm,null,t1_cnuz5j5,null,null,null,1424502760,null,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

I was talking with a co worker about the irony; our canteen sells the Sun newspaper and people will flick through it, however a topless woman, even from the Suns website is NSFW and if brought up on his computer screen  could get him fired.

They don't want a straight swap between Reid and Jenkinson, so when Sullivan gave Reid a pricetag, they increased Jenkinson's so they'd still get a couple million out of a swap (not that unreasonable, Jenks is younger and elite FBs are harder to find than elite CBs).

The thing is, I think they've now priced us out of a move for Jenkinson, so they may have lost their guarantee to secure Reid by being too greedy.

Far better qualified than some punter who happens to have received care in numerous places would be, you know, people who actually study the subject, such as the Commonwealth fund.

To have a low cost and high quality service, you can't also have there be no waiting times all the time. At the moment, the service is to-the-wall and either needs to be:

1) **Alot more money** thrown at it to be able to meet the balooning number of elderly that social care doesn't have the means to deal with anymore (high cost option - hospitals aren't appropriate for long term care)

2) **Invest in social care** - if you walk around hospital wards, particularly around winter time, and compare it to just a few years ago, you will see the majority there are people that the hospital can't discharge, and social care can't deal with (less costly)

or...

3) **Merge health and social care** - this is what Aneurin Bevan himself insisted must be the case. As is, the organisations seem to play a tragic game of human tennis with the elderly and infirm, one that could be avoided if they were under the same department. (cheapest and IMO best option available)

The worse thing is that they are all equally poor.

To reiterate, I'm happy if anyone likes Borini and says ""I have a feeling he'll come good, so I hope we keep him.""

This is precisely what she has done. She seems to think if she signs ownership over to him then she can avoid paying the tax, even though he won't own it. She will still sell the car, or scrap it, but she thinks that signing it over to him will mean she doesn't have to pay tax they owe. She moved house just before she stopped using the car, so I assume any tax-chasing letters will have gone to the other house. In other words, it's quite possible they *have been* chasing her for tax, but have had no up-to-date address.

I'm not entirely sure about paying the income from personal invoices into a company. It's probably possible, but again, an accountant would be the best person to ask.

As a Ltd Co you could certainly employ your wife and pay her a salary. With her earning at or above the personal allowances already, there may be little benefit in doing that. However, if you're prepared to give her a share of the company you could certainly pay her dividends and tax advantage of the tax breaks that way.

And the whole point is that there is no current indication that Borini will score with Liverpool with an extended run of games. There's no evidence that he'll ever score at a suitable rate for a striker at a large club given his entire playing career--he averages less than a goal every 4 games. *That's* what I mean by evidence. If Sturridge comes back and doesn't score for 8 games, it's reasonable for people to say he'll regain form if BR sticks with him, because he's done it before.

This is the disconnect I see from Borini fans. They refuse to admit that and somehow try to rationalize what is undeserved faith in him as a player--he's never been a regular scorer when given a run of games, and certainly not in the PL. Just admit you have a feeling that he can come good despite his performances thus far. I'm fine with that opinion. But when someone tries to say he's great at X or he's young or he hasn't gotten a run of games, etc. it isn't believable.",null,0,null,1421779336,null,0,false,0,cnv5i1u,null,t3_2t290e,null,t1_cnv5i1u,null,t1_cnv4new,null,null,null,1424501691,null,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null

In my opinion, this is one of those cases where the proponents for keeping the law as it is rather than as the select committee proposed have to make a case because this was obvious knee-jerk legislation.

Football is not that. That old favourite ""the eye test"" will usually give you more accurate results than statistics. If what you're watching indicates one thing but the stats say something else, you're still seeing what you're seeing. The stats are probably just misleading in that case.

So, this guy doesn't have access to a stat showing how successful teams are in scoring late winners when they play a particular style of football, having trained in a particular way, with variation in the teammates around them, etc. Kane and Eriksen are outperforming their ""expected goals""? That doesn't mean they'll regress to the mean... maybe they're better than the calculation to find ""expected goals"" anticipated? Maybe an expected goals statistic is total nonsense?

Is Schürrle injured? If he isn't surely it's worth a pop at signing him? He's quality.

My prediction is their midfield triangle of Fabregas at the point and Mikel and Matic will prevent us from finding space in the midfield leaving us passing around the back. They'll use the quality they have going forward to unlock us and probably score 1/2. Oscar will come on in the second half to replace Fabregas and press our tired midfield and close out the game.

* Health care everywhere in the world is inexorably becoming more expensive with demographics
* We have the most cost effective healthcare service
* Ergo we, in the long run, are going to have to meet a funding gap (raise taxes) to meet it.

Fortunately that is for the long run, where we have plenty of space for our fiscal situation to improve (I'm not convinced that our fiscal situation leaves no space for manouvre, but that's not relevant). In the short-medium term we have the option of merging Health and Social care. The only obstacle to this is political. 

This process of integrated Health and social care would be nigh impossible under a private insurance system. Ergo, our best option is to maintain free at the point of service, taxpayer funded Healthcare that is integrated with Social care. Unfortunately, this major issue does not appear to be on the media's radar. 

Perhaps if Health economists and NHS execs were actually in charge of the DoH (or even just competent civil servants, rather than that twit Lansley and latter buffoon Jeremy Hunt), we would have some semblance of rational long term strategy. Unfortunately, we have had a long sequence of political interference, with Labour simply being less bad at this strategy fiddling nonsense than the Tories.

The Ltd Co seems to make sense to me, the last year was pretty good and I guess it's not even over yet.  I have pretty much decided to NOT work for money til April as it seems pointless now that I am being taxed in a higher bracket (right?).  Which maybe in itself is a stupid approach.  But if I were a Ltd company I pay less tax? Or the tax bracket is higher?

My plan with the invoices is to submit them from my newly formed Ltd Company, rather than from myself.  So that when they are paid it goes into my business account rather than my personal.  I know it is slightly dodgy, but is it a possibility?

I really really do need an accountant, but again its that fear of anything to do with money that puts me off.  I know it is weird, my problem is maybe that I know so little about finance that I am concerned I would be taken advantage of by an accountant. Which is why I am slowly gathering information, this subreddit being one of my sources haha.  I want to meet with someone soon, but at the same time I want to have basic knowledge or to be able to fake knowledge when I am with an accountant.  I don't even fully understand what dividends is.

How does it work getting an accountant even?  Where is a good place to start looking and what sort of costs are there with having one?  If I wanted to meet an accountant am I billed by the hour or do they take a percentage of my income? How do I know if an accountant is trustworthy or giving me good information?

I am thinking maybe to stay living in this cheap flat for another year and to save up more for a deposit.  What is regarded as a good deposit amount?

null,false,lurker093287h,null,null,null,"What is 'objectification' (casual or not) exactly, it's such a nebulous term it seems to men 'depictions or treatment of (mostly) women that I don't like' or something. 

And that study is a bit moral panic-ish, it makes all kinds of sweeping statements that I don't think are backed up by what it links to. For example, this quite shocking statement 
&gt;Research has shown that adults – including women – who viewed sexually objectifying images of women
in the mainstream media were more likely to be accepting of violence.


cites to [this study](http://www.researchgate.net/publication/12888075_The_effects_of_gender_and_music_video_imagery_on_sexual_attitudes), which involved

&gt;students were required to attend a research session of 1 hr that was scheduled 3 months in advance. On arrival at the research site, participants were randomly assigned to one of two viewing rooms...the experimental manipulation was exposure to one of two 10-min prerecorded music video segments. The gender and sexually stereotyped video was 'the way you make me feel' (by Micheal Jackson). I chose this video because of it's striking depiction of traditional image of gender and sexuality...the second music video, 'the stand' by (by REM), was the control. This video was a 10-min music segment and excluded all stereotyped images of gender or sexuality.  After viewing the video, the participants completed a 68-item questionare...

&gt;the questionnaire...included 60 randomly ordered statements measured on a 4-point LIkert-type scale, with answers ranging from agree to disagree. These statements measured perceptions of body satisfaction, influence of close friends and unfamiliar settings on behaviour, and locus of control.

But it really gets interesting when you look at the [results](http://i.imgur.com/uLdXR9E.png); even when you leave out that 'rape myth acceptance' 'gender role stereotyping' 'acceptance of interpersonal violence' and 'adversarial sexual beliefs'  all seem subjective and were defined by the author of the study and interpreted by her,  unless I'm really misreading it, the results between the control and micheal jackson viewers aren't all that different at all, with the control men higher than micheal jackson viewing women and there doesn't seem to be any more than 2 points of divergence between control and micheal jackson. Given that it's also under lab conditions and away from 'real world' ones, I don't think that this supports the above statement, or at best it's disingenuous. 

It kind of seems similar to the research showing that playing computer games makes you more violent or aggressive, you can 'prove' stuff (even if it's short term etc) in 'lab conditions' but nothing has been shown in real world ones. Interestingly there actually has been a study that showed a real world correlation between the thinness of models in ads aimed at women (in women's magazines) and rates of anorexia, even if this might be implying cause from correlation at least it's something. 

If it is such a big influence, why do you think that the growth and ubiquity of violent/sexy video games and sexy images everywhere has coincided with (iirc) the longest fall in crime and sexual crime on record and why do you think that images of 'objectification' are so popular in places, like Japan, where violent and sexual crimes are much lower than the UK.

Maybe you're right, and our style of play naturally leads to these kind of results. All it's saying is that the years of data that goes into Expected Goals say that it's unsustainable.

To use another sport as an example, there's a statistic in baseball called BABIP, which is Batting Average for Balls in Play. It measures how often a batter gets on base when he puts the ball into play. The average BABIP most years is .290-.310. You can use the statistic to predict whether or not a batter will continue his current performance. If a player is currently hitting .340, but his BABIP is .390, history tells us that his BABIP will eventually regress to the mean. 98% of players will follow this trend. Very rarely, you'll have a player like Ichiro who can continually maintain high BABIP.

In the snow or icy conditions, when you start off on your journey tap your breaks to ensure that the pads can grip. It might take a few minutes for things to warm up and during the initialy part of your journey your breaking distance might be higher. Also, ensure you break sooner anway so you don't end up sliding.

If you are stopped and no one else is directly behind you, keep your foot on the break. Even if people haven't bothered to demist their windsheild the brake lights should be easily visible. Just don't dazzle the poor fucker waiting behind you.

Keep you sidelights on in the rain or if theres a bit of mist. Its no always essentially but it makes you that bit more visible.

Ensure that your windows (all of them), mirrors, roof, lights and number plate are all clear of snow and mist. 

Ensure that you have water in your tank and that the nozzles aren't frozen over. Just spray a bit of de-icer on them. After a bit of snow its not uncommon to have your car sprayed with grit and mud.

If you drive a 4x4, or have winter tires on, it doesn't necessarily mean that its safe for you to drive as fast as legally permissible, or above, in poor weether conditions. Every time it snows I see 4x4s just speeding down the road like the drivers think they are invincible compared to us riff-raff in our front or rear wheel drive cars.

Don't intentionally drive over patches of snow when you can avoid the . There could be a hole or object in the road for all you know. Keep, when possible, to the tracks that other cars have made.

If you can't see road signings just use your common sense. You don't need to see chevrons to know bow much distance to keep from the car in front.

For the love of god, don't put your main beam on just because theres a bit of snow.

They only want to halt the building of new Nuclear Power stations, and then decommission slowly when capacity can be replaced or phased-out at end-of-life. Their issue with Nuclear is something I personally disagree with (although I understand their concerns), but for some reason everyone goes nuts about this when the Greens are mentioned. It's not as if current governments are falling over themselves to build Nuclear power stations

&gt; EN261 We will cancel construction of new nuclear stations and nuclear power will not be eligible for government subsidy; the Green Party opposes all nuclear power generation and is particularly opposed to the construction of new nuclear power stations, electricity from which is likely to be significantly more expensive per unit supplied than other low-carbon energy sources, and too slow to deploy to meet our pressing energy needs. Cancellation will avoid the costs and dangers of nuclear energy and waste being passed on to future generations long after any benefits have been exhausted.

But it's massively risky for them too. I can imagine a number of different scenarios.

If any party has a semi decent chunk to put up an opposition, they are legitimised as ""the third party"". Everything swings back to the old status quo after five years, with either the next election being the run off between red or blue, with yellow or purple in third place.

Lib dems, UKIP, Greens get a very small combined representation. SNP is put in the position of opposition. Weirdness ensues on a regular basis, whenever ""English issues"" come up and the other guys are pushed into opposition.

At some point a major bone of contention comes up between Tory and Labour, not predicted in any coalition agreement. Neither party will budge, and neither has much claim to seniority as they are closely matched in seats. They effectively become each others opposition at least for this issue. Okay if it's something that can be taken time over, but less so if it's something urgent (war, security, economical crisis) when we'd be suffering the same problems as a minority government.

And their biggest risk to them is should some major crisis arise, which (either rightfully or wrongfully) the government is blamed for. There's no backup to the centre neo-lib for the vote to switch. If things go bad under the tories, labour get in (and while the tories don't like it they can lump it rather than seeing some big political swing) and vice versa.

&gt;*As an opponent of the idea of using women’s bodies to sell stuff I would be happy, but apparently they’re still going to show off women with a certain amount of clothes on, which could be slightly better or not much better at all.*

&gt;*I don’t like it because changing page 3 to cleavage only, maybe a side-butt, angers its fans and does nothing to assuage its critics. Nobody is happy. And that’s what they want. They deny the people against newspaper babes any gain, but they make it an issue that the regular readers have to notice.*

&gt;*And who are the readers going to blame? Feminists. Because they will now think the whole ‘feminist goal’ was to censor some boobs, the anti-sex prudes, instead of the whole ‘reduce the unnecessary objectification of women’ thing.*

&gt;*Not only that, but they’re going to have a whole Page 3 section of The Sun’s website, just for the boobs. Because some people just NEED to see specifically newspaper-sanctioned tits on the internet, apparently.*

&gt;*Twitter is now inundated with angry men being denied their daily areolas, now convinced that feminists hate the natural body and want to ban all nudity forever, outraged concern for the future welfare of the topless models (lol), and impotent demands that feminists put their effort towards REAL issues instead.

If the landlord has told you to hang on to your rent then you have no obligation to continue paying the agent, and the agent has no right to take action against you in his own right.  Ideally I'd want something in writing from the landlord to make the position clear.  Also presumably the landlord will want the rent eventually, so you want to took it away somewhere safe rather than blowing it all on beer and hookers ...

Regarding the deposit as already noted it should almost certainly be registered with a deposit protection service which gives you some cover.  Whether it is or not legally your tenancy agreement is between you and the landlord even if it was signed by the agent on the landlord's behalf.  Ultimately the landlord is on the hook legally for ensuring you get the deposit back (and the landlord who is potentially in trouble if the deposit isn't protected when it should be).  Any dispute regarding what the agent has done with your money is between the agent and the landlord.

As far as the door goes it is clearly unreasonable that 3 weeks has passed with nothing being done.  Again the obligation as far you are concerned lies with the landlord to repair his property - whether that gets done through the agent or not isn't your problem.  You need to start getting official.  AIUI if the landlord doesn't get his finger out you can potentially instruct a tradesman yourself and deduct the cost from the rent, but you need to make sure you do it correctly to cover yourself legally.

10/366 = 0.02732

0.027322 * 31 = 0.84698 (0.85)

People move for work, people move for affordability, people move to upsize or downsize, etc. This happens to owners as well as renters. But if relocating is that much of a problem for people then buy somewhere cheap instead of renting.

&gt; My sil was given two months to move out of her house and now she lives miles away from her family in a grungy, mold ridden flat. How is that okay? 

If the house wasn't hers how is it not okay? Should the landlords who gave her notice be forced to let her stay there if their circumstances change and letting the property to her is no longer tenable for them? Should she have the right to live closer to her family if she cannot afford to? 

I appreciate you actually attempting to answer the question but the level of entitlement you seem to have over who gets to live where is astonishing to me.

null,false,ttamimi,null,null,null,"Question: Where in Bristol? My house was burgled in a similar manner around the same time, I'd be curious to find out if it could be the same culprit(s).

Here's what you need to know:

- Unless the property is managed by the agency, they have nothing to do with it. 
- The door being kicked in is the landlord's responsibility. It falls under Building Insurance claims, which landlords are meant to have.
- Contents however are your responsibility.
- If your landlord is refusing to fit a back door, you have a legal right to sue, on the grounds that the property can be deemed unsuitable and unsafe to live in. If you would like to consider this option, head over to the citizen's advice bureau. Don't forget to pursue a compensation claim for the amount of time you had to go without a back door, as it put you and your belongings in constant risk.
- You will need to involve a solicitors. They're not cheap, but I'd do it.
- The estate agent shouting at you or swearing or whatever is just child's play. Forget that, however, the landlord swearing at you is not acceptable, and can be used to substantiate your claim. Make sure you record any calls or interactions with the landlord.
- If you want to play nice, ask the landlord to contact you **in writing** stating that he/she is not going to fit a back door. This will also help substantiate your claim.

And **most importantly**

before you do anything, make sure you carefully revisit your Assured Shorthold Tenancy Contract. Read it very carefully to examine if there's any band that mentioned building insurance. A standard contract will say it's the landlord's responsibility. Sometimes this is omitted or modified to make it your responsibility. This is cheeky as fuck but it's entirely legal. 

Personal advice: Find another place.

Tldr: I would personally pursue a legal battle on the grounds that your landlord has failed to ensure that the property is safe, and has caused you a great deal of distress, and possibly failed to fulfil his/her duties by purchasing building insurance.

The agency's task here is most likely to manage the property. What that actually means is to liaise communications between you and the landlord, and to issue contracts and take rent. They are not responsible for arranging property insurance. This is definitely the landlord's problem IMO. 

Sorry that my thoughts above are not organised chronologically. But it should give you an idea of what you should be doing.

Her living in a mould ridden flat because the landlord doesn't give a shit is not okay.  
&gt;But if relocating is that much of a problem for people then buy somewhere cheap instead of renting.

Because people cannot afford to buy in the first place. If i had toe option to own my own home rather than rent one I'd definitely have one!

 The landlord broke her letting agreement.   She could afford to live near her family but there aren't really many vacant properties and the area is like one massive community so she feels very isolated.  

Basically landlords are buying any vacant places and letting them out to holiday makers during the summer.  They sit vacant all winter and the ones that do let them out during the winter also turf out the winter renters for the summer season.

For instance we currently have 2 tax bands, 20% and 40% (we also have a personal allowance but ignore that because for the purposes of this demonstration it's not relevant). 20% is charged on the first £31,865 of your income (it's actually not because you don't pay any tax on your personal allowance of £10k, but assume for this example you do). If you are at the top end of that threshold you will pay 20% of £31,865 in taxes = £6,373.

But let's say you get a promotion and all of a sudden you're earning £40k. That puts your earnings in the higher tax bracket but it doesn't suddenly mean you pay 40% on everything, it just means you pay 40% on everything past the £31,865. £31,866-£40,000 is taxed at 40% (£8,134*0.4=£3,253.6) and the rest is still taxed at 20%.",null,0,null,1421784079,null,0,false,0,cnv8i2e,null,t3_2t172j,null,t1_cnv8i2e,null,t1_cnv6lrz,null,null,null,1424500291,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Healthcare is always going to be expensive.  I don't see how obsessing about funding mechanisms makes healthcare better or cheaper.  It would cost a lot to change and the patient experience would probably be mostly the same.

I tend to find commercial work a little unrewarding at times, agency and client changes etc. The end result is often something that isn't what I first envisioned. Which is fair enough, as its a commercial project.  I don't mind doing it because the money is good.

However being taxed 40% on my day rate, I would rather not work or work on my own stuff.  Or do things like this and use the time to level up my life (hopefully).

I know invoicing from my company rather than myself for work already done, is somewhat dodgy. But if I date the invoice after the time of my company forming and I am paid after the company is formed.  It should be OK right?

null,false,calkinsc,null,null,null,"I'm in St. Louis, and I guess you could say that it isn't mainstream popular, but I'd say more than niche, too.  For example:

- Last year, WizardWorld/ComicCon held downtown had, amonst other guests, Matt Smith and Karen Gillan.  1000 seat or so theater room full to see their respective panels.  Matt Smith was even asked about the difference between US and UK fans, and he said (paraphrasing) that UK ones were much more reserved, so he apparently has encountered a lot of US fans who know exactly who he is.

- There have been several theater showings of Dr. Who episodes.  I missed the 50th in the theater, but I did see Deep Breath in one.  Admittedly the theater wasn't full, but there were several separate showings of it so people came at different times, and my wife and I ended up sitting next to another fan, who, as we did, grew up with the series in the US (I started with Tom Baker on PBS in the 80s).

- If you go to bookstores and such, there will be tables of BBC-sanctioned Dr. Who merchandise, plus a number of the novels for sale.

- One of the cashiers at a local pet store has a TARDIS tattoo.

- Dr. Who has been referenced in mainstream media, such as Agents of SHIELD having a TARDIS model in the background.  I recently picked up the latest Castle TV show graphic novel show tie-in (a graphic novel for a ""Derek Storm"" book supposedly written by Rick Castle), and it had an ""Are you my mummy?"" reference with the character wearing a gas mask.

So, I really would say more than just niche interest here, at least.

Humanity has only just entered an era where we realise that we have limited resources and a pretty small window of opportunity to undo the damage we've cause before it's all too late.

The thing is, the developed world isn't really the problem. One football stadium in London isn't going to affect the global environment in any meaningful way and population growth tends to be more steady. But massive population growth in the developing world and all the environmental damage that goes hand in hand with that is the real problem here. We're already fucking up the world and have been for a long time now, but as the population of the planet grows there's increasing pollution, waste and destruction (e.g. the Amazon). Not that I begrudge anyone for wanting a better standard of living as we have in the US, UK etc, but we can't carry on as we are now and every single development project really should be built with sustainability in mind or else we're just making things worse. 

It's not based on much, but I do believe we'll turn it around eventually, the technology there. I just worry that the change will only happen when it's in the interests of big business to make it happen which also makes me pretty sad, frankly, as I don't see it happening soon or quickly enough.

&gt; EU900 The Green Party supports European co-operation on Green lines, as set out in our Vision for Europe (see Part 1). However, the EU is founded on a commitment to economic growth which cannot be sustained.

&gt; EU901 While much good has come out of the European Union there remain many policies that urgently need changing, such as the Common Agricultural Policy and the Common Fisheries Policy. Future developments in the EU must take the EU closer towards Green principles and objectives.

&gt; EU902 The Green Party's aim is a reconstitution of the EU as a European Confederation of Regions on Green lines pursuing ecological policies.

&gt; EU903 Whilst the Green Party is opposed to the objectives, structure and policies of the EU as currently constituted, as long as the U.K. remains a member of the EU the Green Party will stand in elections to the European Parliament and elected Green MEPs will work for fundamental reform of the EU from within.

&gt; EU904 So long as the UK remains a member of the EU, The Green Party will campaign and support negotiations to achieve any improvements in the EU which are possible.

&gt; EU905 Any UK decision to withdraw from the EU shall be subject to a referendum.

With regards to trade in general, you're right that the Green party would obviously want to see a reduction in international trade.

&gt; IP103 The Green vision also involves a fundamental restructuring of the global economy to reverse the unsustainable trend of globalisation (i.e. ever increasing trade between ever distant nations with the primary goal of maximising profit) and a democratisation of the systems of global governance. Multinational corporations benefit from globalisation to the detriment of the poorest in society and to democratic control of each region's economy. Localisation of trade and economies is therefore a goal of the Green Party.

It's not everyone's cup of tea, though I feel that a lot of criticism I see on here is often based on the fact that people don't want to interrupt their comfortable lives, no matter how much they agree with the science of and associated warnings regarding climate change. 

Personally I'm often conflicted about how I feel about certain policies, such as highlighted by yourself, but at least hopefully we can agree that they are at least a party with policies which are built around a central core principle, and that for me makes them a party worth being a part of. As long as the shared principle is the same, the actual policies can always be discussed and updated by the members.",null,0,null,1421785429,null,0,1421786353,0,cnv9des,null,t3_2t2j06,null,t1_cnv9des,null,t1_cnv7w2l,null,null,null,1424499885,null,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14,null

If he explained how the security services could use procedure to protect innocent people and encouraging the production of review systems that prevent innocent people being treated as criminals he might not be so criticised.

They don't seem to get the idea that we have a right to privacy AND security and its the security services' job to balance the two.

Everyone has that option, but not everyone is prepared to make the compromises necessary to achieve it. 

&gt; The landlord broke her letting agreement.

Then again there are all kinds of protections in place and penalties the landlord has to face if this is the case. 

&gt; She could afford to live near her family but there aren't really many vacant properties and the area is like one massive community so she feels very isolated. 

Sorry, but no one has a right to live wherever they want. If there is nothing available, whether to rent or to buy, that is just tough luck. Depending on her needs a card in the local shops seeking a place to rent might garner a response, as might canvassing or talking to local agents if she wants to buy. Otherwise she'll have to make friends in the community where she is currently living.

&gt; Basically landlords are buying any vacant places and letting them out to holiday makers during the summer. They sit vacant all winter and the ones that do let them out during the winter also turf out the winter renters for the summer season.

Sounds like the South West? That is just how the market is there now with demand being what it is. ",null,0,null,1421785634,null,0,false,0,cnv9i7c,null,t3_2t0jv1,null,t1_cnv9i7c,null,t1_cnv8hme,null,null,null,1424499823,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

What a load of bollocks. How are Chelsea winning? That was a penalty. No argument. Typical that that cunt Costa gets away with it.

Markovic has been fantastic. So lively, they can't contain him. Coutinho and Sterling have been great too. Henderson has been *everywhere* while Stevie's legs aren't great (but he's been spraying passes brilliantly). Can has been struggling against Hazard a bit, but let's be honest who doesn't struggle against him?

We've also had two soft yellows but hey, what's a Liverpool game without us getting a few of those? And while I'm at it, Luis with a very similar incident to Markovic's in the Champions League and no red card. Shocker.

He ran into a damaging dispute over the issue with another panel member, Graham Smith, an academic at the university of Manchester’s school of law, who specialises in police accountability.

Smith accused Burnton, a former judge in the Court of Appeal, of seeking to vet what police material should be disclosed to the panel.

null,false,TooLeft,null,null,null,"&gt; now convinced that feminists hate the natural body and want to ban all nudity forever

All you have to do is look at the arguments being trotted out on all of the various forums to see that for a large number of feminists, this is pretty  close to their position except for hating the natural body - but they certainly want to end any portrayal of women solely for their beauty.

The most common argument I have had put at me is that the pictures shouldn't appear just for men to ogle them, if that's the only purpose they should be removed.

First of all, any feminist saying that is also saying the model's wishes are irrelevant but secondly are men no longer allowed to see attractive women and think they are attractive? If a women wants to pose so that men will look at her, then why not? I understand we have had major sexist problems, but this seems like women telling other women that their behaviour is not acceptable according to some nebulous moral code.

If their goal is the end to the objectification of women, they have a major challenge on their hands considering men are also objectified. Tell Hugh Jackman those women screaming at him are all doing it for his acting skills and not his ridiculously sculpted body. Sexual attraction is a part of human nature, and certain people are seen as more attractive than others. Unless the goal of feminism is to deny beauty exists at all, I really have no idea what this campaign was meant to achieve.

As a great comment on the Guardian put it, when my wife is grinding herself on my face about to climax, I'm sure she's not thinking about the depths of my personality. At that moment, I am being objectified. How horrendous.

Saying all that, there's no real reason to have the pictures other than ""guys like them and some women do too"", so it's no big loss. Just mystifying how this was a feminist cause - enforce the taboo against female nipples at all costs.",null,0,null,1421786382,null,0,false,0,cnva02b,null,t3_2t263n,null,t1_cnva02b,null,t1_cnv74ov,null,null,null,1424499590,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

null,false,thehollyhopdrive,uk,Haywards Heath,null,"Here is their policy on where energy is going to come from:

&gt; EN211 We will aim for a largely electricity-based energy system in the UK to match a total final demand of about 900TWh/ year by 2030, which reduces to 600-650TWh /year by 2050. To meet this demand, average capacity for renewables is planned to be 40 GW by 2020, rising to 70 GW by 2030, excluding power for demand balancing and load shifting. This capacity will be provided by the range of renewables set out below (all figures are average capacities).

&gt; EN212 We will accelerate the deployment of both onshore and offshore wind power generation at rates sufficient to ensure the change to a stable electricity-based energy system of 87GW by 2030, but stabilising thereafter. This will require a rapid build of onshore wind to 2030 to provide an average capacity of 12GWe by 2030, and off-shore wind generation capacity will be increased to 17 GWe providing a total average capacity of 29GWe (including existing and currently planned capacity).

&gt; EN213 We will support the rapid commercialisation of tidal stream and wave-powered generators to ensure they are able to contribute at least 5GW each by 2030, and a combined input of at least 20GW by 2050.

&gt; EN214 Rapid deployment of solar photovoltaics will be fully supported, as a key source of decentralised generation, making full use of domestic, commercial and industrial roofspace and limited deployment of ‘solar farms’. We will review legislation and planning guidance to facilitate the potential for leasing roof and site space for local energy generation by third parties. We will target 8GW from PVs by 2030 and 10 GW by 2050.

&gt; EN215 We will urgently review UK potential for hydropower and will support in particular medium and small-scale installations in order to provide 3GW (average) by 2030. We will develop the capacity of pumped storage for demand balancing, subject to stringent environmental safeguards.

Obviously we can argue about the feasibility of this plan, but I think it's disingenuous to pretend that they're just going to turn off the Nuclear power without any alternatives in place. 

I'm a member of the Green party and also personally pro-Nuclear. I think we need to look at it more from the basis of the principle more than the actual policy. Policy change can be submitted, discussed, and voted on by members. The actual principle that climate change is happening and isn't going to get better unless we do something about it is, personally for me, more important to get behind than the current policy at the time, and the Green party seem to be the only party who genuinely give a damn about it.

His first spell at liverpool was when Suarez was here. 
He was about sterlings age and was playing on the wing, since then he has only been played on the wing and occasionally striker. He was never going to start over our players then but he earned some subs and got a loan to sunderland and played winger for a while and when he moved to striker started to score.

When he has played in the striker position he plays okay, I maintain we can get a bigger transfer for him if we hold on for 1 or 2 years, considering Balotelli and Sturridge find form together and Borini is used as a sub for either. He is bound to put in some performances that will earn him a larger offer, even if to a mid table/Euro League club. 15-20 million.

&gt;we're a culture that's covered up our parts for a thousand years, you can't expect that to change fast.

What are you on about? We were in a culture where it was acceptable for a female nipple to be shown in a paper, and now thanks to feminists, it isn't. Things are changing in the opposite direction. We were more liberal yesterday.

&gt;As for celebrities, they're not full on flashing their parts at people, it's one thing showing a bit of leg, it's quite another getting out your boobs

So celebrity evening gowns that show almost the entire breast except the nipple are OK? It's literally just the nipple that's the problem?

As things stand *(and I'm going to ignore NICs for the sake of simplicity)* you pay no tax until you earn £10,000.  You then pay 20% on your earnings above £10,000 up to about £42,000.  You then pay 45% tax on earnings over the upper limit.  

*It's actually a bit fiddlier than this because the tax free band is reduced as you earn more.  This was something the Coalition government did so the increases in the tax free amount would benefit low earners but not high earners.  For the sake of the example we're going to ignore that.*

So, what I'm proposing would be to add more bands.  Something like this:    
Over £5m:  90%    
Over 10m:  100%    
Over 15m:  200%

So, you could earn £4,990,000 and still pay the exact same amount of tax you do right now, based on this model.  Not a single penny more, in fact.  Setting the high tax thresholds at high levels would mean that it doesn't really have any effect until you get to really high earnings anyway.

I'd add some intermediate bands too, but that's purely a personal preference thing.  The important bit is at the top end.  Above that level - A level which **is** intended to act as a disincentive - Laffer kicks in.  It makes **you** not want to earn.  It doesn't remove capacity from the work force or from the overall economy.

Now, this is a simplified example.  There are a number of things it doesn't address at this point:    
a.  There's an issue in that capital gains are taxed at a way lower rate.  (Easilly fixed by removing that advantage.)    
b.  There's the fact that I ignored NICs, but they're basically just an extra band to income tax.    
c.  There're disparities between Income Tax and Corporation Tax.

The thing is, monopolies are unhealthy on a number of levels.  They remove competition and *(I personally believe)* they increase structural economic risk.  What I mean by this is that you remove the entire, ""Too big to fail."" thing.  Lloyds, or Barclays **have** to be bailed out in the event they fail and that burden isn't borne by their shareholders as it should be.  If you limit the practical size of businesses *(individual or company)* you have businesses which can be allowed to die off if they need to.",null,0,null,1421788308,null,0,1421789073,0,cnvba1w,null,t3_2t172j,null,t1_cnvba1w,null,t1_cnv6lrz,null,null,null,1424498925,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

If we want to abolish our right to privacy we will make a law to do so explicitly but it's not for the security services to decide which rights we should have or not have. The have to take both into account or they aren't doing their job. They could frame this as if they are protectors of privacy but given the unenviable task of security in spite of privacy. Instead it's dismissed as a foregone conclusion that privacy is not of concern to them if terrorists are at large. It's considered as merely a public concern and a misguided one at that. 

Not quite. The job of the Security services is to keep the country secure. It's not their job to protect civil liberties. It's parliaments to manage the two. Just as it's not the job of Lawyers not to protect people, but ensure the rule of law is maintained, an that people have rights. Of course, each group is biased in further of their groups aims and purposes.

Neither have I.  It's entirely original.

In my opinion very few people understand the relevance of the Laffer Curve.  The only fixed points are the top and bottom.  People generally think of it as a bell curve, but that's not necessarily so.

What I haven't seen anyone consider is that perhaps over a certain point using the principle at the far end of the curve to disincentivise work might be a good idea.  The idea that distorted wealth distribution is bad is becoming mainstream.  I think that an economy where ten people earn £10m is healthier than one where one earns £100m.

null,false,thehollyhopdrive,uk,Haywards Heath,null,"&gt; Firstly they expect to reduce energy demand by 30% in 20years?

[Energy use already fell 11% between 2000 and 2012](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/337452/ecuk_chapter_1_overall_factsheet.pdf), and that's without a government 100% committed to energy reduction. 

&gt; Whilst at the same time favouring a larger welfare state and open borders?

They do not favour a larger welfare state; they are committed to a complete overhaul of the idea of how welfare works. Estimates for Citizens' Income place it at somewhere around £240 billion per year. The current welfare bill (only counting those that will be replaced by Citizens' Income) is already at £215 billion, so it's hardly a massive rise, and there are other policies in place to make up the shortfall.

There is no ""open door"" policy. Please direct me to the policy that states so if you believe I'm wrong.

&gt; Secondly the Greens think a few dozen nuclear reactors will do more damage to the environment than hundreds/thousands of Wind turbines blotting the countryside?

I'm personally pro-Nuclear, so I do understand you on this point. I think opinion in the party is shifting on this point also. I don't think it is relevant to the point of whether or not their alternatives have merit. You can't say that their current energy policy won't work because another one would be better.

&gt; I think your energy policy needs to go back to the drawing board it's unrealistic and just plain idealism.

The amount of recycling is so low in part due to inefficient contracts held by the local government. They can't cancel these long term contracts (which were not created by the Greens) without incurring huge legal costs. When they got more power in Brighton it was like turning a massive tanker, which couldn't be done overnight, especially in an minority government. That doesn't mean you should use it to trash the national party. 

""Stopping their bin men from eating meat"" is really mischaracterising the situation. They wanted to promote 'meat free Mondays' for health and welfare reasons - not ban meat altogether. 

""Economic growth in the long term has meant more jobs, more money and prevented us from shitting in our gardens."" The economy can grow all it wants but if 99% of the population never see the benefits, what is the point? We DO have more jobs, but many which are on low pay, inflexible hours, no pension etc. Economic growth does not in itself mean better living conditions for the majority of Britons. 

His point about alcohol is stupid. Educating people about the affects of alcohol makes perfect sense. 

I have no idea what this guy means when he says being a member of al-Quaeda will suddenly be legal. The quote he used is from the Greens' manifesto, but it doesn't say ANYTHING about legalising currently banned terrorist organisations, simply ensuring the notion of banning groups is not misused for anti-democratic purposes. 

As for the nuclear issue, I would tend to criticise the Green Party policy, and much more so with their policy on GM products, but I don't expect to agree with a party on every single thing - however, I would let them know my views.

The reason we don't kill them once they get back, isn't anything to do with them renouncing terrorism, or even that rehabilitation is our moral responsibility.

There is no central registry of vehicle ownership any more than there is a central registry of the ownership of bicycles or computers or diamond rings.

The law is much more interested in who has possession and use of the vehicle.  This is the person who the law makes responsible for taxing and insuring the vehicle (or SORNing it if it's off road) and this is the person the law will initially come after for speeding fines and other such matters.  This person is referred to as the keeper, and the law requires them to register with the DVLA.  It is the registered keeper that is listed on the V5C , not the owner. If you look at a V5C you will find that it explicitly says that it is not evidence of ownership.

Of course in many cases the owner and the registered keeper will be the same person.  I own a car of which I am also the registered keeper.  However it is also fairly common for owner &amp; keeper to be different.  A car bought on hire purchase remains the property of the finance company until paid for in full, but will be registered in the name of the purchaser.  A company car will be owned by the company (or whoever they've leased it from) but may be registered to the employee it is allocated to.  And if I decided for some reason to lend my car to a friend for a year it would be sensible to make him the registered keeper but that would not change the fact that it was my property.",null,0,null,1421789292,null,0,false,0,cnvbxo0,null,t3_2t2ale,null,t1_cnvbxo0,null,t1_cnv6rk2,null,null,null,1424498619,null,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2,null

  Coutinho was sublime, Sterling kept working in spite of frustration to create a moment of absolute magic. Moreno was such a useful outlet who constantly threatened. Markovic, while quiet offensively, did a good job, with Can's help, of containing Hazard. Can, although shaky defensively in the first half, played an excellent game overall. Skrtel was solid as fuck. Sakho made a couple of bad choices but was, as usual, good defensively while also offering a decent forward thrust. Gerrard was Gerrard and deserved a goal. Henderson didn't have his best game ever, with a few poor touches here and there, but as always he put in a good shift and should have scored. How Lallana's strike stayed out of the goal is beyond both me and the laws of physics. Lucas proved, yet again, that he is a top DM and a vital part of this club.

Markovic and Moreno play more as wingers who track back rather than wingbacks if you know what I mean. The box in midfield (Lucas, Hendo, Gerrard, Coutinho) is essential to how we play, and the movement tonight from them was incredible.

*We can only string together beautiful one-twos and great attacking moves like we saw tonight when we have a man advantage in midfield, and this is why this formation -- like the diamond last season -- is so effective.*

I also love how either Lucas or Hendo can drop back to start attacks. This allows much more balance in our attack and we were able to create space because they were chasing the ball all day. If both Lucas and Hendo are covered, Can and Sakho are so good at keeping cool on the ball and breaking the line with an accurate pass.

Overall, I'm so proud that the lads have progressed rather than given up. I'm glad that Rodgers has finally found the right system *for the squad that we have* and I'm delighted to see the individual progress.

I'll retract my previous point about energy reduction though I personally feel that it is unlikely your link shuts me up pretty sweetly and I am willing to accept that it is possible. 

However my other objections to the policy still stand for instance Wind farms tend to be large commitments and as you agreed a blight on the local landscape. The promise to increase onshore windfarms significantly to cover the energy shortfall caused by seeing a gradual termination of fossil fuel and nuclear energy production has other problems other than the impracticality of Windfarm energy efficiency. For instance it will require a Green government to deal with the issue of where to build the farms. Which of course will face incredible resistance. Firstly planning laws will need to be changed which in itself will take time, and then you have to deal with local councils and rural residents resistance. A parliamentary victory for the Greens doesn't give them any gains in local government though people do tend to vote for similar parties between local and national elections, typically rural voters tend to bend towards the conservative side of the political spectrum. 

So basically what I'm asking is where are these wind farms meant to go?

&gt; The economy can grow all it wants but if 99% of the population never see the benefits, what is the point? We DO have more jobs, but many which are on low pay, inflexible hours, no pension etc. Economic growth does not in itself mean better living conditions for the majority of Britons.

The point? The 99% always sees a benefit in things getting more efficient, businesses around them thrive and technology improves. 

I object to the lazy thinking that if growth is not beneficial to the 99%, then economic meandering and negative growth would be beneficial. Businesses need bank loans and people need to be able to get a good job. I happen to think that economic growth is a good thing, the issue is that it is not distributed correctly.

Coutinho was a man on a mission tonight and really weaved his way through Chelsea there, even with Mourinho putting Mikel in there to babysit him.

Gutted that we didn't win but it's been some time since I've watched us play like that and the fact we limited chelsea to almost no shots the entire game while attacking like we did was a good feeling indeed.

The key is to recognize where the key talents of this squad are NOW and then build a support structure around them. Improving our certral midfield performances will help both our leaky defense (relieving pressure off of Lloris) and supply more opportunities for our emerging offense. That is where our focus should be right now: either improving the CM talent we already have or bringing in talent that can adapt quickly.

This is the home of who my mates call, SLIPPY G!!!!!! xD xD XD XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD. Top banter! I didn't get it, but I tweeted it twice anyway. Before heading into the stadium, I headed to a merchandise stand and purchased my match programme, a brand new Chelsea FC winter coat (only 300 pounds!), and of course, my half and half scarf! We made our way into the seats and joined our brothers who have also been long-term and totally not plastic fans. I started to get nervous, as I was worried I wouldn't know all of the clever chants and what not! My mate said to not worry, they had a good one that they had been working on for a long time. It goes: DIAAYGO DIAAYGO DIAAYGO, or something like that, I'm still working on it! xD! Then he told me our favourite song, adopted from equally non-plastic Sporting Manchester FC fans, that goes, and get your XD's ready for this one... ""You'll never SLIIIIIIIIP alone!!!!!!!!!!!"" Upon hearing this musical interpretation of comedic genius, every fibre of my body xD'd with great power... launching me deep into the sky, as you could hear the faint murmur of DIAAYGO DIAAYGO"" xDDD*

Even if we did sign a player of Matic's quality  I would still keep Lucas as competition for that position. If Lucas gets injured now we will have to switch to a different system.

These are 2 separate things.  Registering a basic company is a very simple process which can be done quickly and cheaply online and doesn't have anything to do with banks.

Getting that company a business bank account is a separate issue and will likely take a bit longer (although if you have a reasonable credit history and don't want anything more than basic facilities it shouldn't be too difficult - it only gets *interesting* if you want to borrow money).

&gt; I've never understood VAT. I suspect that if when I do start a company it has potential to make over £81k. Is this the same as allowable expenses?

No. Allowable expenses have nothing to do with VAT, except tangentially.

VAT, conceptually, is a tax on consumption.  Specifically pretty much everything you buy (with certain exceptions) has VAT added to its price by the company selling it to you on behalf of HMRC.  Those companies have to keep track of how much VAT they're collecting and periodically (usually quarterly) send that money to HMRC.  

At the same time those companies are also paying VAT on the supplies they buy from other companies. Since VAT is only supposed to be a tax on the final consumer, VAT registered companies are allowed to subtract the VAT they pay on supplies from the VAT they charge on sales and only send the difference to HMRC.

Example: Company A sells products with an ex-VAT price of £10,000. They must add VAT at 20% to their prices, therefore they invoice their customers for a total of £12,000, collecting £2000 in VAT.  In the same period they buy supplies with an ex-VAT price of £6000, or a VAT-inclusive price of £7200.  Therefore they have paid out £1200 in VAT to other suppliers.  They must send to HMRC £800, being the difference between the VAT they've collected and the VAT they've paid out.  The ex-VAT of those supplies is also an allowable expense when calculating taxable profits, but that's a separate issue.

Small businesses such as yours with a turnover below £81,000 do not have to register for VAT (although they can do voluntarily). A non-registered business does not have to charge VAT on its sales, and cannot reclaim VAT on its purchases.",null,0,null,1421791888,null,0,false,0,cnvdmya,null,t3_2t2edn,null,t1_cnvdmya,null,t1_cnvbn4w,null,null,null,1424497825,null,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1,null

I don't agree. Being a total mess of a party was the problem, not the policies. Segments of the party in open revolt, being unable to figure out how to harness the anger of councils, not knowing what to do about entryism and coming up with a clumsy, ham-handed response, an especially ill-judged 1983 manifesto that even as a devout socialist I can admit was never going to go down well with British people, etc.

After Foot, Kinnock began the process of dragging the party rightward and won squat, including losing the unloseable election. It wasn't the policies (one could have maybe argued that with Foot, but certainly not Kinnock). 

Blair, for all his faults, was the first reasonably competent, media-friendly leader going into a general election that the party had had since Harold Wilson. Combine that with a really nightmare five years under John Major, and Blair could have been advocating for some really radical shit and still won, which is why he's considered such a missed opportunity.

Also worth pointing out that, in my opinion, John Smith would have absolutely been the next PM had he survived, and his values, while moderate, were much more firmly rooted in the traditions of the Labour Party's than Blair's.

In essence keep all windows shut and locked, all curtains drawn and what ever you do don't answer the door. 

Here's a link to the CABs website on dealing with bailiffs: http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/wales/debt_w/debt_action_your_creditor_can_take_e/bailiffs_e/letting_a_bailiff_into_your_home_e/how_can_a_bailiff_enter_your_home_e.htm


Your next job is get down to the CAB. Ask for a debt appointment. Explain all your debts. To me it looks like a non priority debt and your best plan of action is small token repayment scheme. A CAB debt adviser will contact the agency for you and help set it up.  THAT'S even if you have to pay the debt in the first place. (I'm too lazy to do this now). 

In the meantime, every time the company makes contact with you explain to them that you're in contact with the CAB and that you're waiting on their instructions.

EDIT - my point is that it's meant to be ""your average person's / family's newspaper"". I have no problem with 'sexual objectification in its proper place'.

However the conflict over this issue among women, as illustrated by Nicola Mclean, is quite interesting in that it reveals quite a big split among women in what constitutes success.

Lets say there's one class of women: educated, academically/professionally competent, who are making their way in life through jobs like business / law / serious media etc. For them, something like page 3 is an embarrassment, they want to be treated as colleagues, not as sexual objects, and combatting sexism in this way helps to provide them with opportunities.
 
However there is another class of women, lacking the same opportunities as the first class, who nevertheless have something: their looks and femininity, that enables them to get ahead (far more 'ahead' than *their* other opportunities would provide). These women don't have the option of a career in law, for most of them, it's either using their looks and femininity to get ahead, or a life of relative drudgery.

For the latter group, the choice is an easy and obvious one - hence the frustration at 'broadsheet readers' who don't get it.

null,false,DC_Coach,null,null,null,"Concerning DW's considerably smaller popularity here in America, I'll agree with those who've pointed to **availability** as the primary (not only, but most important) limiting factor. 

I.e., were DW televised on an American network channel or on basic cable, I believe that before long there would be a *lot* more American fans of the show. It would never reach anything like the levels present in the UK, of course, primarily because DW is not an iconic American *shared experience* (what else could you call it?) going back 50 years. The Brits I've known and talked to about this have made it abundantly clear to me how popular DW is in the UK, and many others I know aren't naive about that.

The rapidly-growing ""niche"" over here that faithfully/fanatically keeps up with Doctor Who does so in spite of these availability issues. 

The niche we're speaking of is:

a) dedicated because they love DW, and 

b) has access to the show.

My family, for instance, Netflix-stream-binged S1 - S6 (three times for me), then bought and watched the S7 DVDs, then watched the broadcasts of TDotD, TTotD, and then S8 on BBCA. 

I'd agree that while it is a disadvantage to know few people who watch Doctor Who, there is an upside: get them to watch the show, and if they like it, you've helped create a fan! Now you have someone to talk to about it! :)

IMO the group of people who have Netflix or Hulu, stream video, binge entire seasons of shows, have BBCA, etc., intersects somewhat with the technically savvy crowd ... which, almost by definition, intersects with the ""sci-fi fans"" crowd ... and, therefore, the group referred to as ""geeks"". And there are of course plenty of, shall we say, ""intense"" fans in this country, just like there are everywhere else.

Concerning American television, I've been at the front of the line bemoaning the choice of broadcasting reality TV (particularly ""scripted reality TV"") instead of dramas, comedies, whatever. The good thing, IMO, is that streaming is becoming more and more popular every day, and today's customers have choices like never before; the days of networks and bundled cable are numbered. Reality TV and Idol and DWTS and the like may be here forever, yes, but limiting our choices to that stuff will soon be nothing more than a dim memory.",null,0,null,1421792636,null,0,false,0,cnve3y6,null,t3_2sznga,null,t1_cnve3y6,null,t3_2sznga,null,null,null,1424497605,null,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1,null

&gt;are men no longer allowed to see attractive women and think they are attractive? 

&gt;enforce the taboo against female nipples at all costs.

&gt;Unless the goal of feminism is to deny beauty exists at all, I really have no idea what this campaign was meant to achieve.

Keep setting up those strawmen, mate.

Feminists don't hate the female form and they certainly don't hate you for being an admirer of it - good job making it about you, by the way - it's about the context and nuance. Women are already objectified and used to sell stuff everywhere else in the world, the argument goes, do they really need to have it staring at you from the front of a newspaper as well? They don't seem to think so.

We've got a society where newspapers focus more on what women (powerful women at that, like First Ladies in the US) wear than what they do, where girls are being sexualised earlier and earlier, where breastfeeding in public is seen as obscene and dirty, etc. In most of the world its frowned upon or literally illegal for half of the population to go without a shirt on, because boobs, yet they're apparently allowed on the front of red tops for men to giggle over.

But no, you're right, it's *totally* them wanting you to feel bad for being attracted to women. *Good fucking job*.

Also, I'm pretty sure that while a lot of women find Hugh Jackman attractive, his look (like most action heroes you care to name) is more of a male power fantasy than a female sexual one.

1.  Move off in 2nd gear to prevent wheelspin and looking like a dick as you dig yourself into the snow.  If you drive an automatic then use creep to move off before gently building revs.  

2.  If you drive an ~~Audi~~, Mercedes or BMW then get the bus, so you don't block the roads with your silly car that you can't drive in the snow (happened to me, SLK and a 3 series coupe blocked a motorway onramp in front of me on Friday and nobody could continue their journey).  

3.  Leave LOADS of room between yourself and the car in front because you WILL skid into them if you are too close and they stop suddenly.

4.  Use engine braking to slow down before applying the brakes.  Think ahead and plan what you are going to do.

5.  If you have a sports car, or a RWD car, putting some heavy bags of grit in your boot can improve your RW grip in snowy/icy conditions.  Added bonus - you can put it in front of the wheels if you get stuck in ice and it improves grip on icy surfaces.

I dont know how i can be with them on so many things but then there is about maybe 15% of their policies that to me see completely and utterly bat shit insane. They want to create a society that is a liberal haven but then allow fanatical terrorist groups who want nothing more than to destroy such a liberal haven to be allowed recruit and go about their normal lives till they inevitably blow something up. Its so fucking weird. 

I like the idea of a coalition of them and the Tories so we can somehow end up in the middle of sanity. 

I feel like a lot of their policies come from this belief that people are inherently good. I see this a lot of from my very liberal middle class friends who have never seen / been a vicim of real crime.

I bought wristbands as my only intial investment to run events. Wristbands were sold to people as their entrance ticket to attend the events I ran. 

All of the events had a theme, the themes were normally ideas my friends had based around music (for instance Swing dancing, or African carnival, or electronic music) which were then further developed by me and that individual. 

I focused on running the business aspects; sales, strategy, negotiation and marketing.

The business plan was relatively simple; book a venue, book an artist, advertise and make sure the event sold out. To make the event sell out we were creative, I could tell you how to get people to come to events but figure that out for yourself, if you can't you aren't trying hard enough/it's not you.

My two issues were 

1. Being an arrogant fuck and thinking I knew everything, and that I didn't need a team. I was good and I did well but my business partners were brilliant and I should have learned to leverage them and give them control over the areas where they were skilled and focused on the things I was good at

2. Spending all of the money I earned on clothes, girls and alcohol. You don't get rich by spending money, and you don't stay rich by spending. I could be worth easily £100k now and probably have a house and a car; if I'd saved. Instead I have about £2k and rent, I'm in a well paying job etc. but I'm £98k down on where I should be. So save!

Serie A is a more tactical league, not a more defensive league. The quality of full-backs in Italy is abysmal. They do not press as hard as in England and if you're saying wingers can have very productive seasons under Mourinho, then Willian should've had the same. But I'm guessing your comment is in reference to his first spell at the club, during which time we played a completely different system wherein our attack was heavily based on quick wingers counter-attacking. The pace in England is also a lot higher and a lot of players struggle with it when they come over.

The costs will reduce dramatically over time. Besides we need as many sources of renewables as possible. As you hinted at no one source of renewable energy is entirely consistent and as such we need a range of options to provide consistent power. Tidal would be good alongside wind and solar and wave power generation and geothermal generation where possible with hydroelectric dams adding too.  

&gt;whilst at the same time making big profits for private companies

You have two choices - either taxpayers pay for some government department to try and develop this technology or you let private companies take a gamble that they can make money if they invest in innovation. We are a capitalist economy meaning we almost exclusively choose the latter. If you want tidal technology developed it will probably have to be developed in large part by a private company who would never have done it in the first place if they didn't think they could make money off it it. People invest in new ideas if they can make money from it and mostly, provided there's competition, we all benefit. Every aspect of you entire life involves this reality so green energy companies being successful is no scandal. 

It's expensive at the start but the targets and the subsidies are all necessary at the moment. If I make a product in my front room it's going to be no match for the big company that mass manufactures a competitor product to mine. That's what renewable energy companies are trying to do - compete in a crowded market and if they aren't helped they WILL be squeezed out which is bad for everyone. Only once the renewables industry has the skilled people, infrastructure and institutional knowledge can they produce a product that is as cheap as the big carbon fuel guys. We are in the process of that happening and support can be reduced very soon as renewables will be competitive on their own.

Movies and TV series rarely occur in the same time- usually a movie comes out after the TV series has finished (inbetweeners, twin peaks), before the TV series starts (stargate), or at the same time, but using different characters (marvel agents of shield)...and I guess the reason for that is, if a movie is succesful, and they want it to be succesful, a sequel would be requested, a sequel which would directly follow on from the movie, and it's hard to directly follow on when there's at least one full series between instalments. It's also hard to film a movie while doing a TV series with the same cast- there simply isn't the time. 

A common suggestion is to have it with a former doctor- which would remove many of these obstacles...but would be confusing for new audiences (and the film would want new audiences), and a source of concern for investors/distributors who would want the cast which would have the most attention.

I've come around to liking Andy Carroll a little more this season but i think he's a distraction to the way we play/should be playing. What i mean by that is we seem to play way more direct when he's on the field as well as Sam Allardyce needlessly changing our shape to accomidate him even though we were playing fluid, fast tempo football when he was out injured for the first few months of the season.

https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/65713/6883-electricity-generation-costs.pdf

FYI: Onshore Wind energy in 2015 at the very most costs 20% more than energy produced via coal or gas. By 2030 Coal and Gas energy costs will increase by 20-30%. Meanwhile Onshore Wind energy is set to drop by around 5-10%. Meaning in 2030 Onshore Wind energy could costs 40% less than Coal or Gas.

Offshore Wind Energy currently costs 75% more than Coal or Gas energy but by 2030 it's predicted to drop by 50-60%, again making it cheaper than Coal and Gas.

So in conclusion, Wind energy has higher capital costs in the present but in the long term the investment will pay off.

Tidal Energy is a very new field, it deserves investment but it also needs time to find the correct solutions to invest in.

Solar Energy is very costly in the UK and isn't really worth a lot of investment. Wind Energy make up the vast majority of the UK Governments 30% renewable energy target.

There are plenty of European countries with highly respected universities who run a perfectly well-managed system of either negligible or zero tuition fees for higher education. Even closer to home- the Scottish and Welsh University sectors can hardly be said to have collapsed in the absence of £9,000 per student coming in.

The reason the fees ""had to be"" raised under this government was because the coalition decided to slash the Higher Education budget by ~80%. That's it. It doesn't even bring in any more money to the universities in question- it just shifts the burden of the proportion of the budget that was previously funded by general taxation to the students themselves. 

It's the reason I've absolutely no time for any Lib Dems that try to defend the fees U-turn as a ""tough decision"". The deal that the party ended up with was [halfway respectable](http://www.libdems.org.uk/get_the_facts_student_finance), but the smug, wilful complicity in an *entirely manufactured* crisis is enough to legitimise the strength of the public backlash. 

They could have stopped it. They had more than enough sway to stop it. They just didn't negotiate well enough, and gambled that it was something they could afford to lose.

The trick is to work out how to make yourself work, so you can be as efficient as possible. I'm still working on this, but tonight I handed in my 24th weekly essay since fresher's week of first year, and I'm yet to miss a deadline (though tonight was freaking close! 4 minutes to spare!), so hopefully I'm doing something right.

I'm not a NatSci (2nd year Historian), but as u/bwl17 said, NatScis socialise like the rest of us, and they definitely don't have to sacrifice sport or hobbies. One of the NatScis in my year not only rows for college, but plays university level squash, and runs the college bar. You can definitely have time off if you learn how to make it.

You're right, Cambridge is the perfect place to get stuff done. Home will seem so fucking dull when you're back, believe me! Today I had a Doctor's appointment at 8:30, a lecture at 9, wrote a 2700 word essay start to finish, had a grim 30 minute land training session for rowing, attended my college history society meeting, and played pool in the bar with some friends after that. Today wasn't an overly active day :P

Cambridge is the most intense and tiring experience ever. It's great, and after five minutes in the car home after term ends you'll want to go back. Good luck. :)

ps. Like everywhere, there are people who do drugs and people who don't. I have never directly encountered any drug use in Cambridge, and I'd bet that's the case for the majority.

I grew up in an all female household due to my father being a violent and sadistic character, and have seen female family members and friends go through the worst experiences. It is an important topic for me. This campaign, however, is the biggest BS.

The fact that it is a 'newspaper' doesn't alter the conversation one bit, your statement consists of the same emotionalist, manipulative argument employed regarding recent internet filter and pornography bans- why won't somebody think of the children?!! It is a victorian ethic and an unhealthy attitude towards nudity and sex. It is also censorial and anti-pluralistic to try to dictate what is and is not acceptable in news.

I don't buy the Sun, and find page three to be a cringeworthy artifact of a past era. For a start it really doesn't make economic sense in an age where anybody can bring up a pair of breasts on their smartphone- surely NewsInt would rather use that page real-estate for more profitable purpose?

However that this campaign is seen as a win for feminism rather than a regressive and puritanical act of censorship, particularly in the wake of what happened in Paris, is baffling. It assumes the authority to dictate what an independent newspaper can print, it denigrates women who make different choices regarding their own bodies, it asserts hyper-conservative attitudes towards nudity.

Regarding objectification, it is an issue in our society (if it dehumanises- objectification in itself doesn't always have to follow as harmful). It applies to both sexes, although I wouldn't contest that it is most definitely historically a more male asserted phenomenon. Then again a good friend who has been zealously in favour of removing page 3 also spent a good fifteen minutes on her lunch break a couple of months back cooing over David Gandy and loudly telling anybody that would listen her disappointment in her boyfriend. The trick to deterring the objectification of women by the next generation is raising children well, with healthy attitudes, not removing a section of an easily ignored tabloid.

Also I don't like the no true scotsman/feminist card, but your 'have some balls' statement- so assertiveness, confidence, sexual directness are all male qualities? And furthermore somebody not showing those can't be male?

&gt; At the moment I am withholding invoices til I work out what to do with them, whether I should have them paid into a business account or if there is a smarter way to manage the money.

You're doing exactly what I did, and it's exactly wrong. You're favouring a sense of ""order"" over actual results (measurable in £).

It doesn't matter what software you use, if you don't get the money.

You'd be better off having your accounting on the back of an envelope if, once a week, say every Monday or Tuesday afternoon, you went through every unpaid one and phoned up the debtor and politely asked them when they were going to send you a cheque. 

Likewise, it doesn't matter what the ""best thing to do"" with your invoicing is, moving forward, if you don't get the money coming in. It will never cost you more than a few percent to do things inefficiently - that can add up over the longterm, but if you fail to send an invoice then you might not get any of it.

I can tell you from personal experience that failing to send an invoice because you ""want to do it right"" allows customers to go bankrupt, move abroad or just forget about it. It's really fucking hard to chase a debt when it's two years old and you're speaking to the customer and they're saying ""I'm sorry, I just don't remember that work - I'm sure I would have paid it"".

&gt; all I ever hear about retirement savings is negativity. Am I right in thinking that retirement savings sometimes don't pay out or live up to their expectations?

I'm sure there are some that have not met best expectations, but I doubt any have done so poorly as burying your head in the sand and pretending the future will never come.

This subreddit is big on stock market trackers, which are a way to spread (hedge) your risks over a wide range of companies (see [this page](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpersonalfinance/wiki/lumpsuminvestment#wiki_step_4.3A_additional_savings_for_the_long-term_in_a_stocks_.26_shares_nisa_or_a_pension.), I think). Stick most of your money in index trackers and, when it comes to retirement, live off the dividends. Buy trackers which have low costs (regular articles about this posted in this subreddit) and also mix in some bonds. Don't touch it, get nervous about stockmarket fluctuations or crashes or try to ""time the market"".

Your safest bet for retirement is that the world's largest 500 companies will still be producing stuff (and thus paying dividends) in 2 decades time, and if you look at the historical data, you'll probably see that's true. IBM and Dell were still going, last time I checked.

From what you've told us, my estimate is that you could retire in 2 decades if you're disciplined. You may enjoy your work, but establishing your retirement now might allow you to retire to the Greek islands and concentrate on your art, or you might need to retire due to ill health.

Looking ahead and doing this now will allow you to be comfortable, secure and in the sunshine.

How could you tell? :p

But really I just try to get people to think, which isn't really taught these days. In regards to Feminism it's either one of two things:

1) It's so all encompassing of different ideas that you will agree with at least some of those ideas

2) It's a specific collection of ideas, of which you will agree with either few or most

If it's the former then it's utterly meaningless - so it begs the question why do people get so worked up about people bad mouthing it? If ""everyone is a Feminist"" then effectively nobody is. In a truly abstract logical sense a set that encompasses every possible element is equivalent to a set that encompasses none of them. 

If it's the latter, then it's a coherent ideology that can be categorised thus criticized.

If I were to go really deep into it I'd make the assertion that there was some deliberate trickery involved. By getting everyone to declare themselves feminist you get people defending it out of habit and the true beliefs and motivations are masked.

You're clearly a very delusional, pretentious person. I have had more than one argument with you on /r/northernireland and I have taken your arguments apart every time. If you were able to come up with something new, maybe I'd sit her and allow you to jerk yourself off while thinking you're 'intellectually superior'.


&gt;Actually you'll find its a small percentage of my posts are about Sinn Fein. There's bigger fish to fry than a tinpot provincial party preaching a cold war leftism who hold very little real handle on power, and by the limited scope of their appeal, pose little chance of ever doing so.


In your case, I don't think that's a good defence, because your only other interest seems to be atheism and humanism, both of which are breeding grounds for pretentiousness. Most of your posts to this sub reddit are very negative, and that's probably why you get so much hate here. You're living in the 70's.


&gt;Its just that I don't find the slightest reason why Sinn Fein should escape public scrutiny - especially when it comes to its role in sheltering child sex abusers, not to mention other crimes its party hierarchy are guilty of.


The DUP are no saints either, but I don't see you ranting about them. Claiming gays cause floods, labelling Muslims as untrustworthy and spending thousands of pounds of tax payers money to fund homophobic backwards policies are things that have happened recently. Adjust your clock and start living in the modern era, buddy. Get over yourself.

An action flick is arguably contextually the right place to see a muscled guy. It's also removed from reality so you expect some fantasy and exaggerated realism 

As for your forcing opinion comment. This is how society has run for hundreds of years. Least of all voting for Government created an outcome half the country don't want. But also any sort of civil rights movement, creating change that improves a society where everyone is tolerated and not felt to be marginalised or treated badly by huge sections of society.  We are constantly making and remaking society, some will approve, others won't. There's not much that can be done about that.

It could equally be argued that by having page 3, those that support it are forcing their opinion about what a woman should look like and how men should treat them onto others. 

It's a very tricky balancing act this whole society business, trying to appease everyone whilst also creating a fair and safe community. 

If they had successful band all printed pornography, I'd be stood right there with one. But that isolated one very specific thing that objectifies women and creates false ideals of 50% of the population, and sought to diplomatically change it.

Just look at our goal difference... it tells you the story.  When we win, we're just scraping past teams.

The whole page 3 thing involved some people signing a petition and campaigning over an issue that they found problematic and a business then freely making a decision in line with what these people were campaigning about. Although I'm willing to bet the Sun probably did it to boost sales rather than because they totally agreed with the morals of the campaigners. Which is fair enough because it's a newspaper and it's there to make money.

If there's a problem with how the whole 'get rid of page 3 campaign' was carried out then there's a problem with so many types of activism like this. Should people just not peacefully campaign against issues they find problematic? What should they do instead - just accept it?  

So long as the people they are campaigning against are not threatened into complying I don't see what's wrong with it. It's actually an example of freedom of expression working. 

I don't think its fair that a peaceful campaign that has been carried out has been turned into 'evil feminazi attacking free speech'. Especially when we've seen such horrific attacks against free speech recently.

I think your point about a 'militant debate' is correct - The Sun chose to do something, freely, and no ones free speech has really been upset.

When it happens because someone is driving incredibly negligibly, as in the video above, one can definitely judge.  Pulling out because you didn't see the cyclist cos it was raining and their lights were dim?  Understandable.  Because you couldn't be fucked to clean your windscreen?  Screw that.  

When I got hooked by a car overtaking me and turning left just before a mini-roundabout, they made a 'mistake' - they didn't *want* to hit me, but they did, by driving carelessly and dangerously. I reserve the right to judge, be angry, and report their driving to the police.

&gt;Most cyclists are so far from 'good' road users I can almost never sympathise with them.

As a cycle commuter, that's indefinable rubbish.

&gt;All the ones I've seen where a cyclist gets lamped they've deserved it.

Really?  There are plenty of overly aggressive cyclists seemingly looking for an excuse to stick their videos on youtube - similarly, there are also plenty of videos of cyclists getting assaulted with vehicles or fists after perfectly legal riding.

&gt;Driver in the video seemed apologetic, having made a mistake. Good enough for me.

I'm glad the driver apologised, he seems sincere, and I don't think he'll only clean a fraction of his windscreen from now on.  However, the rage of the cyclist is entirely understandable.  He was inches from being flattened.   Pure chance, not any action by the motorist, prevented a collision.

If you're a old time customer to it, and just looking for a new practitioner then I doubt there's anything that can be done to change your mind about it, and you know the ropes.

But if you're new to the game then there's a lot about hypnotherapy that you should realise.

First off, there is literally no good reason to think that things like this work *at all*. There are some studies that show a benefit to hypnotherapy but they're all pretty much useless; effects like [regression to the mean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_fallacy), reporter bias, recollection bias and a host of other things are typically just ignored (with the intention of making something bogus look like it does anything). When you do the proper meta-analysis of the studies the only benefit to be found is in continuous subjective post hoc variables, not something to trust with your health.

Second of all, it is very easy to appear to be *far* more legitimate than you are. *FAR* too easy; any twat with no idea what they're doing can get accredited very easily to sell these things (slightly related example: I know for a fact you can sit down and be ""accredited"" -for some definition- to sell homoeopathy in less than 30 mins, the two scenes are very tightly linked). Things like reviews, websites and phone numbers are also very easy to set up to give the appearance of legitimacy. You can't tell if these people know anything about psychology, and I would wager most don't.

 Again, if you're going for shits and giggles then that's fine but if you're going to seek help for a psychological issues you're trusting a LOT to some randomer who might not know anything about what they're doing. And paying a shitload for the privilege.

Please think very carefully before going along for any session, it's a risk. CBT can be free on the NHS and [works](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3584580/).

&gt;

&gt;The __regression__ (or __regressive__) __fallacy__ is an [informal fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informal_fallacy). It ascribes cause where none exists. The flaw is failing to account for natural fluctuations. It is frequently a special kind of the [post hoc fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_hoc_fallacy).

null,false,lgf92,null,null,null,"&gt; I'm 20 years old. I currently live in Portugal and I'm planning to move to the UK. I don't have any degree, and I barely have any work experience, only worked at a call-center for a month or so.

At the risk of sounding harsh, you and a million others. [750,000 people aged between 16 and 24 are unemployed in the UK](http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/research/briefing-papers/SN05871/youth-unemployment-statistics) along with around 1.2 million other people.

If you don't have any particular skills, experience or qualifications, you will find it very hard to find a job in the UK unless you have a personal connection (friend, relative, etc.). Work that you do find will likely be low-skilled and down near the minimum wage (as you're 20, £5.13 an hour, rising to £6.50 when you turn 21), and you will be in the same boat as hundreds of thousands of young Brits, some of whom will have university degrees. 

If you can stomach higher living costs in the UK and really want to live here, then by all means come over. But work is very hard to come by. You will find it very hard to find the kind of job you're looking for from overseas - they will want to interview you in person, not by Skype or by phone. If you're after something more professional, you could look into jobs as an apprentice or trainee translator, but they will be competitive and Portuguese isn't a major trading language in the UK. 

That said, I know foreigners who come here and work as waiters/bar staff/cleaners just because they like it. But be aware that it will not be easy. [The cost of living in London is almost double that of Lisbon](http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/region_rankings.jsp?title=2014-mid&amp;region=150), and there is no British city that will be cheaper to live in than Portugal.

null,false,tiberiousr,null,null,null,"Not exactly, whilst the party can provide him with the funds to enter the election, the election campaign itself requires a lot more funding. The Green Party is entirely funded by its members. They don't take big donations from corporate interests or special interest groups (unlike the Tories, LibDems, Labour or UKIP) so crowd funding initiatives like this are a useful platform for members and the general public to directly support their local candidate if they so choose to.

Also, whilst the party is funding his candidacy it's also trying to fund candidates in various constituencies so things like this mean that a local candidate can easily ask for extra campaign funding from their own electorate which is handy considering that party membership dues are extremely low. I checked the party website because I wasn't sure and it's not free for unemployed/students etc, their rates are on right sidebar [here](https://my.greenparty.org.uk/civicrm/membership/joining) and as you can see it's very, very cheap. Less than £1 pcm for unwaged and half that for students.

Full disclosure: I'm a member, in full employment and my membership dues are something like £3 per month.
