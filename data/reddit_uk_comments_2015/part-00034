One of the most beautiful places I've been was Edinburgh. You must visit. I'd suggest the whiskey experience if you're into that, and also going to some of the pubs in the old town. Other than that go explore, everywhere in that city is lovely.

London is a must of course, and you should enjoy the parks. Hyde Park and Regents are amazing, and the height of the trees was dumbfounding for me. So beautiful. Go to Borough market and eat your heart out lunchtime and walk the south bank of the Thames. Go out at night to the hip clubs in Shoreditch like xoyo if you enjoy electronic music or something down in Brixton. See if your favourite artists are playing there too and go see them. I don't get many concerts in Rio, especially not the nice alternative music, and everyone plays in London sometime. The Roundhouse is amazing.

Still on the night out, if you can go out in Manchester, also very nice. Dunno if you'll be able to get Warehouse Project, but that's cool too.

Eat lots of full English breakfasts to cure hangovers, and look for the nice little cafes for it. Always nice.

If you like nature I'd say go to Wales. The coast in the Gower Peninsula is beautiful. And up north Snowdonia is also amazing.  The white cliffs in the south are also quite the sight. And Brighton is a jolly place, and I liked the independent shops and cool streets.

Spend a day in some of the small cities, like Chester, York and Bath.

Liverpool is cool too and lots to do. Newcastle isn't posh but has great night outs. The castle in Cardiff is nice and the park beautiful too. Also great crazy night outs. Welsh people are v friendly.

I've enjoyed living in Birmingham, but it was such a personal experience and I've enjoyed it mostly because of my mates and uni life it is hard to recommend something there and around. I dunno if you'd enjoy the simple things I used to like just cos I lived there.

Haven't been to Cornwall but everyone says it is brilliant, and the peak district too. Also haven't been to the highlands, that they also say its nice.

Tldr. Edinburgh, just go.

Edit: Oxford and Cambridge. Go there too. I loved Oxford, but be prepared to pay up to visit some colleges unless you know someone that studies there. Go have some of Ben's Cookies by the market and buy books at Blackwell's. Go up the church and overlook Radcliffe and the all saints (I think that's the one).",null,0,null,1422327951,null,0,1422361983,0,co1zm20,null,t3_2tscjc,null,t1_co1zm20,null,t3_2tscjc,null,null,null,1424371034,null,25,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,25,null

null,false,ScienceGaveMeAHadron,null,null,null,"I think UKIP is far more credible than the Green party.

Greens seem to sell themselves as an intellectual option, a scientific option purporting a more advanced and responsible society. However a lot of the ideas they put forward are hilariously childish, backward, unfair and unscientific.

They claim to be against arms manufacturing, arms sales and militarism in general, this is all well and good apart from the fact that the UK is a world leader in military technology. Companies like BAE systems allow us to continue as a world leader (maybe even world number 1 in some eyes) in technology and engineering, funding our universities and developing technology that does benefit the civilian sector.

It shows a childish idealism about the military, the military is not there to kill people. A military force is a means to guarantee a nations sovereignty in diplomatic relations, nothing more. Comparing military expenditure per country is not a fair means of judging how 'militaristic' we are, we spend more on our army because we have higher wages, we want pensions and healthcare for our troops. Since we are a civil and democratic nation we want our troops to be protected which means the best technology, body armor and night vision for our men. The reason Nigeria spends nowhere near as much as the UK is because they don't have to care about their troops lives as much. Once again it shows a view on the matter I'd expect from a 15 year old, not a political party. Even in the world of Star Trek, a utopian future, they still have a 'military' force.

As for their environmental policies, they are awful. Reliance on wind and solar can not fuel an entire powergrid in a country where we are already suffering from powercuts. Germany has tried and currently has the most expensive power per kWH in the world and their goals to meet power demands with wind and solar have stalled. Germany has doubled its electricity prices in a decade and now they're opening coal powerplants to meet the demand since renewables are unreliable. We have no method to store energy long term therefore we need to provide a constant source of power, something Hydro and Geothermal can do but Wind and Solar cannot. 

In a country where everyone is asking for an easier base life the Greens would throw us at an energy infrastructure that has been proven to be problematic and expensive in other countries and they'd disregard much superior options like modern nuclear plants, at the very least these would provide a long term, reliable and efficient method to provide power.

Their manifesto has almost Maoist ideas about food production, 'small local farms producing a wide variety of food groups', we had that - it was called the middle ages and required 90% of the population to work as farmers. What business does the government have in the area of designating farms in the first place. Banning GM crops which could provide solutions to droughts and other issues we will see in a world damaged by climate change is outright moronic and anti-science along with their ideas on organic foods.

They would cover all these gaps with raised taxes on multinationals and crippling taxes on the rich. Where exactly would this money come from and why would these people not leave to more lucrative areas, especially since Greens wish to prevent the expansion of transport infrastructure that would allow economic growth of the country.

Lets not even start on their social policies which often border on social injustice, as for immigration I never think we should just allow people in. Migration should be a way for the country to get needed, skilled labour in not just allowing everyone in, even if they are in poverty we must improve the state of the countries they come from not evacuate veryone from those countries.

I am staunchly for preventing an ecological disaster, however the right way about it is to use technology to allow us to continue to grow and develop, not to go back to some amish level of technology and hamstring our own development.",null,0,null,1422328224,null,0,false,0,co1zr1w,null,t3_2tqbn8,null,t1_co1zr1w,null,t1_co1e19f,null,null,null,1424370970,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

I'm not going to get into the semantics of the IRA - we will deal with them as the IRA, whether its P, C , R or otherwise is irrelevant to what we're talking about. Unless you have involvement with either MI5 or the IRA itself, you will not be aware of the membership difference. You're on a a very public forum talking about it, so I'm going to assume you are involved in neither. 

This is absurd, they are quite clearly different organisations, it is hardly top secret insider information. 

Your two Links, one is an Ex-member of the now defunct PIRA who is in his sixties. The other is was a member of RIRA who was killed precisely because he got involved with Drugs.

Now i won't deny there are former members of these groups who have drifted into this activity, but to suggest that the IRA was involved as an organisation is ridiculous. The Garda who are no friends of the Republican movement are quite forthwrite on the subject.

In 2005

&gt;The head of the Garda National Drugs Unit, Det Chief Supt Cormac Gordon has said there is no evidence to suggest paramilitary figures are involved in drug dealing.
He said while there may be fears that some paramilitaries will turn to drug dealing now that the Provisional IRA has been stood down, there was no intelligence at present to suggest this was happening.[Source](http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-24804167.html)

Again in 2013

&gt;Garda sources last week said there has **never been any evidence of an organisational link between the IRA and drugs criminals** in the UK, but they are aware that former IRA members, including members of one well known family with both IRA and criminal links in south inner Dublin, has links to organised crime and drug dealers in Liverpool and the Midlands of Britain.[Source](http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/ira-druggang-linked-to-double-british-murder-26823015.html)

Now, I don't mean to say that Nick Clegg is a bad person, but to me, I've always thought that Clegg's biggest mistake was agreeing to the coalition without getting the ONE THING the people who voted for him wanted: a chance to be heard.

In exchange for the Lib Dems support, the Tories said that they'd hold a referendum on AV.  That's good. But what they did was make it between ""first past the post"" and ""instant runoff voting"" - and really, the differences in practice between the two are so minor that there is no reason to bother showing up.  Election reform is my number one issue - one I've been working on worldwide since 2004 - and even I would not have voted for the proposed referendum in 2011.  

Clegg should have held out for Single Transferable Vote or some other form of PR.  He so wanted to be part of the coalition ""in power"" that he gave up any *actual* power he actually had at the negotiating table. 

That's why Clegg shouldn't be leading the Lib Dems.

null,false,xljunior,null,null,null," Cesc Fabregas may have a sixth sense for a killer pass, but he needed to reach for a pen and paper when Jose Mourinho offered him a return to the Premier League with Chelsea.

Chelsea’s move to sign the former Arsenal captain from Barcelona as a replacement for Frank Lampard was one of the shock moves of the summer transfer window last year.

Rather than relying solely on his imagination to see how he would fit into Mourinho’s team, Fabregas wanted to see it in black and white.

“When Chelsea came, of course I studied in my mind how I could fit in, but I also wrote down the team. I always write the team down,” Fabregas said.

“I had spoken to the manager and I knew what he wanted from me, but after that I always try to analyse what kind of squad there is, if it’s good for my type of football because sometimes you can be as good as you want but you don’t fit in some certain styles. I felt it was a really good move for me after I wrote down the squad.” 

 Fabregas has certainly proved he fits Chelsea’s new style, as the midfielder has been one of the stand-out performers in the Premier League and in Europe this season.

Chelsea face a big and potentially decisive week, starting with a Capital One Cup semi-final second leg against Liverpool on Tuesday night. Fabregas and his team-mates need to provide a reaction to the Bradford City FA Cup humiliation by booking a Wembley date after drawing the first leg at Anfield 1-1.

null,false,RedditMcRedditor,nottinghamshire,Nottinghamshire,null,"I'd like to see all benefits being means tested, including pensions.

Benefits are supposed to be a safety net for the poor, not a top-up for the rich. This is emphasised by the fact that you can not claim unemployment benefits if you have over £16,000 in savings. Yet pensions and disability living allowance are not means tested. We even continue paying the winter fuel allowance to pensioners who are living in Spain, and disability allowance to lottery winners.

There are roughly 2-2.5million unemployed. There are 12million claiming a state pension, and 12million claiming disability benefits. (With some overlap between the two being highly likely.)

A lot of the people costing the most money to the tax payer are given money they don't need, while a small group gets shafted at every opportunity because they make a good scapegoat.

And all the while they're defended by people saying ""Well, they're entitled to it"". Large companies are also entitled to use loopholes to legally avoid paying taxes, it doesn't make it right for the rest of the country to have to foot the bill.

Either all benefits should be means tested or none at all. This picking and choosing to favour votes is creating a massive tax burden for the younger generations, and creating an un-payable situation where the pensions bill rises faster each year because of people living longer.

Back in the 1950s there were 10 workers for every pensioner. Now there is only 3. By 2020 that figure drops to 2 workers for every pensioner. And current pensions are paid for by current taxes. Pensions are NOT like a savings account where the government saves all of your money in a big pot just for you.

Pensions are essentially a huge ponzi scheme. And while the government have tried to mitigate the problems of this by making employers offer their own pensions schemes, this will only delay the inevitable, which will be tax increases across the board to plug the huge hole in the pensions bill we're going to have each year.",null,0,null,1422331837,null,0,false,0,co21nz3,null,t3_2tqbn8,null,t1_co21nz3,null,t1_co1wbcd,null,null,null,1424370006,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

null,false,lepusfelix,null,null,null,"Actually it's an incredibly ignorant something, but my remark isn't the ignorant thing.

The ignorant thing is the part where there *are* actually people out there who genuinely have a problem with Muslims, simply based on what they see/read in the news, and completely in spite of there being plenty of Muslims who live here, and the vast majority are completely awesome people.

The reason I raised the ISIS&lt;-&gt;Islam thing is because a lot of people don't ignore the link between the two.. and practically always in the worst way possible. There is a link, but it's not ""These terrorists are Islamic, therefore Islam = terrorism"". Instead it's the fact that ISIS's main goal is to establish their own religion-centric state, and eliminate competing Islamic factions. Or at least it was...

So basically an internal struggle in the Muslim world, very little to do with the rest of us. But now, fear of being attacked by the aggressors in the East is taking hold here in the West. It's not an intentional byproduct, no, but it is a byproduct of continuous and pointed use of terms like 'Muslim extremists' and 'Islamic terrorists'. By stoking discomfort over a smallish (but growing, partly due to exposure) faction far away, coupled with an ever-growing post-recession xenophobia here at home, it's creating a case where people are being told 'don't worry about your brown neighbours, they're probably ok, just worry about the ones with guns and bombs'.. except people respond with 'but how do I know my neighbour isn't buying bomb making equipment and planning to kill me?'. They get wary around normal, innocent people.

Ever since 2001, there's been a steady rise in (fairly biased, considering) coverage in the Middle East, and people really aren't very much trusting Muslims right now. This is a very noticeable thing. I'm pretty sure if I was a Muslim, I would have noticed it too. I would have noticed large parts of the society I live in suddenly start looking at me differently, like I don't belong, and like I'm some kind of monster waiting to kill them all. I can't begin to imagine how hurtful that would be. Maybe if I wasn't me, I'd probably be quite angry about it too. Putting some thought into it, it doesn't seem such a crazy thing that sometimes people go off to join these factions. However, my advice to anyone contemplating it is to remember one thing. The man who wants you to kill for him will always say he's your brother, and he'll give you the world, but the man who asks for your safety only is truly your brother, and with him you already have the world.",null,0,null,1422334824,null,0,false,0,co234gp,null,t3_2tpfb0,null,t1_co234gp,null,t1_co1ppeu,null,null,null,1424369326,null,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1,null

Failure to do so would not only result in what was a possible quadruple being halved, but also raise doubts about Chelsea’s ability to hold on to a five-point lead over Manchester City at the top of the Premier League table, ahead of the sides’ Stamford Bridge showdown on Saturday.

Fabregas knows better than most what it takes to win silverware and also that the best team cannot simply rely on talent to earn them medals. He is a World Cup and double European Championship winner with Spain, and secured La   Liga, Copa Del Rey and Club World Cup winners’ medals during a three‑year second stint at Barcelona.

He has only an FA Cup winner’s medal to show for his eight years at Arsenal, however, and experienced first hand how Mourinho’s Chelsea teams of old could drag themselves over the line. “At Chelsea, for sure we can win many, many medals for the next years because we have a very talented young team,” Fabregas said. “But it’s not about the talent now, it’s not about the team, it’s about how much we want it.

“If this team really wants it to the end and we are focused and determined to achieve big things, then I’m sure in the next few years Chelsea can be a top team.

“I played against Chelsea teams that maybe talent-wise were not at the level of this team, but mentally they were there. You knew that every single game you played against Chelsea it was going to be tough and that’s what we have to prove with this team. I think we are playing very attractive football, a team that is enjoying their football. You can see that on the players’ faces and in the body language.

“We are really enjoying the way we play, we are helping each other and it’s nice to see. But people will not remember that if we don’t win the Premier League or whatever, so we have to make sure that we compete until the end.

“The Capital One Cup is the first trophy of the season, so you want to be there, we want to be in the final, so we’ll try our best and, hopefully, it will be a very good night for us.”

One of the clearest examples of the mental strength that helped Mourinho’s Chelsea teams of old deliver so much success was the 2007 League Cup final, in which Fabregas played for Arsenal.

Fabregas and his young Arsenal team-mates earned the plaudits for an impressive performance, but Chelsea left the Millennium Stadium with the trophy, having won 2-1.

null,false,wxwax,null,null,null," “At Arsenal, we were most of the games [against Chelsea] the better team, but we were always losing,” Fabregas said. “I always said the same thing. Arsenal, Arsenal, Arsenal, Arsenal. Then one long ball or one free-kick, Drogba goal. It was always the same.

“That tells you that it’s not always about the quality and the talent, it’s also about how much you want it, how much you know how to play your game. Their game was stay compact, compact, compact, compact, take your chances. They did it very well and they had good players, so you have to respect that.

“In terms of winning titles, of course I felt that at Arsenal we could have won more than we did because we arrived to finals and semi-finals, and most of the time we were nearly there. Of course, there is something in your heart that regrets not having won. You need that drive. I always felt it at Chelsea from the outside. You need trophies. You see Chelsea as a team who has to win trophies. It’s the same as Barcelona.

“To be successful on a daily basis, when you go to Europe and you are fighting in the last games when you want to win the Premier League, we are going to need this drive and strong mentality to be the best.”

Experience will be crucial for Chelsea as they attempt to close out a season that still promises so much. Fabregas is now 27, having played for 11 years at the top level.

“I have lived many great moments in football, also really bad ones, so I do maybe have a bit more experience than a normal 27‑year‑old, but I am just trying to do my best to help,” Fabregas said. “We have young players and we just have to make them see that if we are strong and mentally ready to compete, we can win big things.”

Fabregas became a captain at 21 when he was handed the Arsenal armband in 2008. Mourinho has hinted he could one day captain Chelsea and the Spaniard has not ruled out the possibility of eventually succeeding John Terry.

“First, there are many great characters and John Terry will play for a few more years,” Fabregas said. “But if they ask me [to be captain], then why not? It’s not something I think about, though.”

With or without the captain’s armband, Fabregas has never been afraid to speak his mind in the dressing room.

“Players at Arsenal can tell you better, when I was captain or wasn’t captain it didn’t change what I do,” Fabregas said. “Even at Barcelona or here, if I have to tell something to the team or some players, I will do it. That’s my personality, that’s how I am. With the armband or without the armband, I feel always the same.”

Fabregas has set up 20 goals in all competitions already for Chelsea and has become the first player to chalk up 15 assists or more in two Premier League seasons. He is firmly on course to beat the record of his former Arsenal team‑mate and friend Thierry Henry, who assisted 20 Premier League goals during the 2002-03 campaign.

“You sense situations,” Fabregas said. “I’m just thinking always for the next move, what will happen. I always try to look around before the ball comes to me, but I don’t know specifically how I do it. It just comes naturally. Sometimes it goes good, sometimes it doesn’t go good, but I try, I keep trying and I’m persistent in some final balls.

“You have to have the eye for it. You can see a pass and decide not to play it. Me, I see 10 passes and I will try eight, so I am very persistent. I know this will make me lose more balls than normal because I could player two-metre passes. But, instead, I prefer to try for the 30‑metre passes. I know like this I will always lose more balls, but at the same time I will create many opportunities for my team-mates.

“Of course, I would like to beat Thierry’s record, but it’s not an obsession. Sometimes you go five games without any assists and all of a sudden in one game you have three. It’s always been a part of my game. I think every year I have good numbers in assists. I have a soft spot for assists and killer passes since I am very, very young. I like it.”

Like a great striker who can instantly relive his best goals, Fabregas has his favourite assists ready to reel off and broods over the ones that got away.

“I remember assists like a goalscorer remembers goals. I have a soft spot for them. The pass I was disappointed that it wasn’t a goal was the other day against Swansea.

“I hit a volley to leave Diego one‑on‑one with the goalkeeper and he didn’t score, and I killed him afterwards because it could have been one of my best ever.”

It is not just his passing ability that attracted Mourinho to Fabregas, as he has always possessed a strength of character and devilment that could be equally as vital for Chelsea.

He fought his way into the Arsenal team aged 16 and eventually took Patrick Vieira’s shirt, battled for a position alongside the likes of Lionel Messi, Xavi and Andres Iniesta in one of the finest Barcelona club sides of all time and decided to return to England with Chelsea, one of Arsenal’s closest rivals. “I have made tough decisions, but I always take it in a positive way,” Fabregas said.

“I am a competitor, wherever I go I compete. I don’t care what people say or what they think of me, I go to be the best and to win my spot in the first XI, and this will never change.”

Chelsea will lean heavily on their tough competitor with a soft spot for a killer pass over the next four months. ",null,0,null,1422336452,null,0,false,0,co23upc,null,t3_2tsn80,null,t1_co23upc,null,t1_co23ubz,null,null,null,1424368985,null,7,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,7,null

####The First Doctor's console room: [1](http://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2012/12/Hartnell.jpg), [2](http://doctorwho-execution.weebly.com/uploads/1/5/1/2/15121058/7440529_orig.jpg?0)

The original. I love the pure rocket age '60s retro futuristic aesthetic. I like how it's got that cold sci-fi look to it broken by the odd bits of furniture and things that seem like souvenirs from his travels. It really makes it seem more alien.

####The 7th/8th Doctor's console room from the TV movie: [image](http://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2012/12/mcgann-tardis-3-610x411.jpg)

I love it because it doesn't seem like a console room. It's arguably one of the most different takes on it in the entire series: It's this beautiful Victorian library that happens to have a Tardis console in the center of it.  It really sells the concept of ""bigger on the inside"", it has this sense that the space inside is enormous. The console itself is gorgeous as well - as others have said, it sort of evokes the spirit of H.G. Wells' Time Machine in its design. It's a shame this one wasn't used more.

####The Eleventh Doctor's first console room: [1](http://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2012/12/smith-tardis-3.jpg), [2](http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120603154524/tardis/images/7/73/DoctorsTARDIS-Eleventh.jpg)

This console room gives it a distinct organic feel that definitely makes it seem like the Tardis is alive. It's the first console room to be truly split level, with both a downstairs below the main platform and a balcony above. Speaking of stairs, it feels incredibly cavernous with several different stairways and arches leading off to parts unknown. The sensation  is really driven home by the swooping curves and asymmetry of the walls.

Next day you have to do the same again. Except you need to find a new load of employers and job ads. After a week, you realise that the jobs that you applied for and seem like a perfect fit seem to be coming up again and again. Your applications to these jobs results in tumbleweeds. 

You are at home, so make no human contact all day.

null,false,iaindings,null,null,null,"Regarding talking to the owner - I wouldn't waste your time. I don't agree with the fees and I doubt the owner will think they're fair but I also doubt they'll care enough about it. Reason is supply and demand - by the time you've got hold of them they'll probably already have tenants. Private landlords also don't have a concern about their own image like a business would too. And besides, even if some tenants are pissed off enough to swear off ever using that agency again.... Well there's plenty more where that came from.

I'm not condoning anything, I just think it's not worth raising your blood pressure over. You are going to find this difficult so concentrate on finding a home rather trying to exact vengeance. You're going to find it difficult, forgetting the fees, put yourself in the position of the landlord - would you prefer a tenant with a secure full time job or someone without, even if they did offer a large deposit? They don't want to go through the hassle of evicting if the 6 months paid upfront dries up and they don't know you personally.

Can I ask though, if you've got sufficient funds that you could be out of work for a year, would buying a property not be a better bet? Going off topic here but if you put in a chunk of cash now then your mortgage would be cheaper than the rent (probably) and you'd have what you've paid in as equity. You'll have the same issue of being unemployed trying to get s mortgage but the barrier most people have to buying is not being able to provide a good deposit. Just a thought

Best you can do is test very thoroughly, pro-actively look for and apply operating system patches asap, lock down and disable as much as you can on your server that you dont need, and then frankly hope for the best and monitor for attack attempts - its similar to home security - don't put your high value items on show to the outside world and make your property more hassle to break into than your neighbours.

Exactly how they are going to continue to fund this policy when everyone quits their jobs to spend all day lying on the sofa is not elucidated.

Effectively, they seem to want the UK to be in perpetual recession. Less consumption, fewer jobs, less wealth, less money every year till we're all trying to eke a living selling turnips off our allotments while singing fucking kum-bah-yah

The rules essentially say that:

* A company must meet certain conditions in order to apply to be registered to advertise jobs outside the EU
* If they are accepted for registration they can offer jobs to people outside the EU, but only once they can prove that they have advertised the job throughout the entire EU and they haven't found a suitable candidate.
* There are only a limited number of visas the companies can apply for each year.

If you girlfriend is not an EU citizen of some description then she will likely have to leave the country after getting her master's degree, so I don't think marrying her is an option to allow you to stay.

Of course, if she is an EU citizen, then matrimony or demonstrating that you have been cohabiting for some time is a viable option for you to move to the country where she is an EU national (subject to that country's laws), and from there once you have satisfied the requirements of her country to become a citizen of that country you would of course be free to settle in the UK.

If she's a UK national or has UK citizenship matrimony or demonstration of cohabitation *and her alone meeting the income requirements*  would be enough for you to be allowed a spousal visa which may impose restrictions on your working.

Of course marriage is a big step and it's not a decision to be taken lightly or purely to get permission to live here.

The only options I can think of right now are to either get a limited-time youth mobility visa, or get a job in a company in Canada, and be transferred over here. Most of the time though the only people they allow to be transferred are either here for a short time (3 months or less) or they are senior people within a large company, although from time to time other specialists are transferred.

The only change is that they are now prompting the existing customers who ignored the earlier message. For these customers, if they now try to access a website that would have been blocked by the filter they are presented with a pop-up  which then asks them if they want the filter or not.

It seems that the nethersphere can't have been in operation continuously through human history, since there are numerous example of other things (and ""nothing"") happening to the dead elsewhere - Torchwood is full of them for one thing, and *The Ghosts of N-Space* seems to be at odds with the presence of the nethersphere too.  

There is also the way that the Nethersphere was seen to be in operation in the future in *Into the Dalek*, leaving at least some people with no existing body to return to in *Death in Heaven*. As a result, it seems more likely that it had been hopping about through time collecting samples of people here and there (evidently a LOT of samples though). So the afterlife in this sense was only a possibility rather than a certainty.  

Again, *The Ghosts of N-Space* suggests that there may be a form of ""after-life"" present in the Whoniverse anyway.  

Curiously, of course, for there to be any justified knowledge of an afterlife, it immediately suggests that at least one person must have returned in some form or another to tell people about it at a early enough point in history for the concept to have been incorporated into religions, if the Doctor's suggestion is correct.

null,false,Timothy_Claypole,null,null,null,"There are already good answers here but to add a further view:

The biggest mistakes wannabe web developers make are:

* not doing enough websites
* doing basic websites and hoping HTML/CSS alone will somehow land them a job
* not using sensible practices like source control
* lack of bespoke coding as opposed to installing Drupal/WordPress

So my advice is:

* if you do switch courses, do a more general computing course that will teach you about software, networks, databases etc. More career flexibility. 
* you can learn web dev on the side, but the key thing is practice. The more, the better
* think of an idea for a personal project, a website you think ought to exist but doesn't. Write it from scratch. You will always be motivated for something you love.
*accept that you will rewrite things over and over to make them better
* if you can find any paid work via family or friends then great but don't do work for free. No motivation and you will have to dump them in it at some stage.

If you are serious about this then you should have already begun to write websites. Could even be silly trivial things. The most important point is to keep coding. Second to this is always try to improve on what you did last time. Personal pride and all that. 

Learn how things work. A natural curiosity helps a lot. DNS is not a black box that magically produces IP addresses, it is a hierarchical distributed system across the Internet. JPEGs do not magically shrink down pictures, they throw away detail you may never miss, but in such a way that they are unsuitable for solid blocks of colour with hard edges.

You do not have to be Alan Turing or something, but a lot of web developers don't know how the web works and that is a mistake. It is a common interview question to ask about the underlying protocols.

The person that said stick with the course is probably right.

This leaves only £90bn to fund a £180bn gap, so even if you cut all non-protected Welfare spending you'd still need to find £90bn by a wealth tax and cutting the military, which I'm not sure is possible, although it is probably possible to get pretty close - probably close enough that finding a few basic income exemptions (prisoners, say) would get you all the way.

null,false,finmair32,aberdeen,,null,"Leading Italian clubs have targeted Aberdeen midfielder Ryan Jack.


Roma have been monitoring the progress of the Dons midfielder, who is under contract at Pittodrie for another 18 months, but they face competition for the former Scotland under-21 international from fellow Serie A club Napoli.


Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes has secured all of his key players on new long-term deals in the last month and Jack is the last of high-profile first team regulars the club is keen to tie down. But with the Dons three points behind leaders Celtic at the top of the Premiership and preparing for a League Cup semi-final against Dundee United on Saturday, Jack has asked for talks to be delayed until the end of the season.



The Dons' attempts to keep their player, who has become an integral part of the midfield, could be tested by a bid from Italy.



Roma, who are second in Serie A, had been tracking Jack but third-placed Napoli's need for reinforcements is regarded as more pressing in Italy as they continue their chase for a top-three finish and with it a place in next season's Champions League. It appears the Partenopei have jumped to the head of the queue.



Napoli, who beat Genoa 2-1 at home last night to move into third place in the table, are looking for midfield reinforcements and have been scouting Feyenoord captain Jordy Clasie and Anderlecht's 17-year-old midfielder Youri Tielemans. But agent Ivan Reggiani claims Rafa Benitez's side has also been watching Jack and views the Dons player as a potential signing.



Reggiani believes Jack's experience and price tag make him an enticing proposition ahead of the other two midfielders.



He said: ""The Napoli squad needs some reinforcement especially at the back. It must be at least a defender and a midfielder. Ryan Jack is a great Scottish footballer and has made a lot of appearances for his club despite being only 22. Tielemans and Jordy Clasie are important players at their clubs and command exorbitant prices. In a short time Jack has become a champion.""",null,0,null,1422351037,null,0,false,0,co28br5,null,t3_2ttkn7,null,t1_co28br5,null,t1_co287bx,null,null,null,1424366899,null,3,false,ScottishFootball,t5_2sba4,3,null

null,false,Froolow,null,null,null,"A negative income tax is a different thing - it slightly less egalitarian than a basic income tax but much less distortionary on the market. The main difference is that the NIT is progressive, whereas the basic income is flat.

So say we agree £10,000 is the amount people should be provided by the state if money were no object (any less and it would be sad for them, any more and you'd damage the economy too much by taking too many people out of work). A basic income gives £10,000 to everybody in the country, whether they earn £0, £10,000 or £100,000. If we can't afford £10,000 each, then we get as close as we can without bankrupting the state, which for the Greens seems to be somewhere between £3000-£3500.

A NIT is set at some rate (say 50%) and the state agrees to top up your income to £10,000 as a proportion of this rate. So if you earn £0, the state gives you ((£10,000 - £0) * 50%) = £5000. If you earn £5000 the state gives you ((£10,000 - £5000) * 50%) = £2500. If you earn £10,000 the state gives you nothing, and if you earn £20,000 the state *takes* ((£20,000 - £10,000) * 50%) = £5000. In Freidman's original proposal, the rate of tax was flat (so that one 50% rate applied whether you were recieving money from the state or paying money as a millionaire) but you could make the tax more progressive at the cost of making it more distortionary by introducing tax bands in either the negative or positive portion of the threshold.",null,0,null,1422354190,null,0,false,0,co28yk8,null,t3_2tqbn8,null,t1_co28yk8,null,t1_co1g67a,null,null,null,1424366532,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

Acronyms, if you have been taught any, and if referencing people, give them shortened nicknames. For example, instead of referencing Gichin Funakoshi (founder of Shotokan karate...

That's not how this works! (to the estate agent, not to you)

Assuming it's one of the government approved storage schemes it should be plain sailing for you. Basically, when the deposit storage schemes were created they were very much created to the renters benefit and protection. The estate agent does not get to choose if the money is released to you or not.almost all disputes will end in the money coming back to you. The estate agent has to go a long way to prove any amount they need to claim against the deposit is valid.

First port of call is to contact the storage scheme company and update them the landlord is making threats about the money. Find out if the landlord has made a claim against the scheme.

Second thing to do, tell the estate agent to take it to arbitration with the deposit scheme company.

Current growth is based mostly on consumer spending, even though consumers have had less in their pockets, due to wage freezes and inflation, since 2010. That growth in spending is either not coming from the general public (I'm not a economist, so I don't know how that would work) or it's built on the average UK consumer putting purchases on credit. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but a country's economic growth cannot be built on consumer credit. Individuals have to pay their debts on time, and if there is any sort of disruption in the banking system that makes companies call in debts, up interest rates or tighten lending, then the recovery's over.

Honestly, I think the panic over Syriza is unjustified. They will be radical (by Greek standards) in terms of social issues (being the only major party that is pro-LGBT, anti-military, anti-religion), but in terms of economy I think  winning will force them to moderate towards the standard Social Democrat solution (I mean in this election they even use some of the same buzz words that Labour use such as ""cost-of-living crisis"") of making cuts to investments to non-public institutions and the military, and raising taxes on businesses.

To handle recession and debt there is austerity and investment, and all the things in between.

From an investor's perspective though, Syriza winning should be a godsend. They have something that both ND and PASOK lacked - basic integrity. Most of Greece's fuck ups came down to politicians in both parties being corrupt (the whole crisis started because the Greek government deliberately under-reported the scale of its debts until they were close to bankruptcy), greedy arseholes exploiting the system, [meanwhile letting their rich business partners get away with large scale tax fraud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_evasion_and_corruption_in_Greece#Greek_media_dynamics). They were able to get away with this because no-one could challenge them (especially after basically making all MPs immune to criminal prosecution).

&gt; The Hershey Process milk chocolate used in these bars is cheaper to make than other types of chocolate as it is less sensitive to the freshness of the milk. The process was developed by Milton Hershey and was the first mass-produced chocolate in the United States. As a result, the Hershey flavor is widely recognized in the United States, but less so internationally, in particular in areas where European chocolates are more widely available. The process is a trade secret, but experts speculate that the milk is partially lipolyzed, producing butyric acid, which stabilizes the milk from further fermentation. This compound gives the product a particular sour, ""tangy"" taste, to which the US public has become accustomed, to the point that other manufacturers often add butyric acid to their milk chocolates.

What im saying is that letting agents don't do any of that, the £200 basically pays for a credit and background check, even then none of it is done in house, they will send it off to a referencing company that will charge maybe £25 for a 2 minute background check. That is £175 for doing fuck all. £150 if they splash out and spend another 2 minutes getting a meaningless reference from a previous landlord. 

Add that to the fees charged for putting something up on rightmove and opening the door for a viewing and it's basically a scam.

But no these facts that you are by the way welcome to google are in fact me talking out of my arse.

I'd appreciate it if you didn't use the word ""idiot"" in this context, I consider it to be very offensive to the mentally disadvantaged:  
  
*""In 19th and early 20th century medicine and psychology, an ""idiot"" was a person with a very severe intellectual disability. In the early 1900s, Dr. Henry H. Goddard proposed a classification system for intellectual disability based on the Binet-Simon concept of mental age. Individuals with the lowest mental age level (less than three years) were identified as idiots; imbeciles had a mental age of three to seven years, and morons had a mental age of seven to ten years.  The term ""idiot"" was used to refer to people having an IQ below 30.  IQ, or intelligence quotient, was originally determined by dividing a person's mental age, as determined by standardized tests, by their actual age.""*",null,0,null,1422361289,null,0,false,0,co2ah60,null,t3_2ttqaj,null,t1_co2ah60,null,t1_co28jof,null,null,null,1424365825,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

That's really not the point and I really hate this cop out answer to things.

I always find it interesting the people who are allowed or excused from so called offence when their right to self identification is diminished.

I was personally involved in an awkward incident at work where I accidentally identified a Kiwi GUI developer as Australian. The ""offence"" he took was mild irritation at having to correct someone *yet again*. This was the second time in my life I'd made such an error, having done the same at a party years before. No one got placards out and protested my house demanding my head, but in both situations they firmly corrected me. I had a Canadian colleague who would do the same when mistaken for an American.

Identity is important to people.

No, in the grand scheme of things it's not *that* important in reality, but I've seen /r/uk get very precious about the things that make us British. I've seen Scots and the Irish offended at being called English. The offence, in all cases isn't that big a deal.

But one thing I've never seen in any of those cases is the mild correction after the fact referred to as political correctness. There seems to be a small list of groups that no matter what are simply not allowed to take even mild offence. I'm not talking rallies and boycott campaigns, I'm talking even pointing out that someone got a small detail about who or what that person is wrong.

Imagine someone did it with your name. Imagine you're Kevin and Trigger like I kept calling you Dave. The offence isn't that Dave is a bad name, it that you have to bother correcting me simply because I'm too rude to listen to you the first time or respect you enough to make the correction stick.

This PC thing you all hate is literally a basic level of polite respect for other people. I find it odd that so many people are downright against it.

I'm not coloured. White isn't a default of which me and anyone not originally of European stock are an aberration.

If it's important to you that I know you're from Teeside, Cornwall (Kernow), Westmoreland, Cambridgeshire or Glasgow (some of the flares exhibited in here) then surely you can see how some people might not want to be lumped into a generic ""not white"" group.

In the new system, it's set to the RPI+3% if your income exceeds £41,000 and the RPI if your income falls below £21,000 with a sliding scale in between, or 0% if that is higher.

In a period of deflation, paying off your loan early can be a good idea as the value of your loan will be increasing in real terms at the interest rate of 0%. 

In periods where the RPI or the RPI+3% is substantially above inflation measured in ways more relevant to investment income, it can be very difficult to find an investment that isn't terribly risky that pays enough to cover the interest gained on a 2012 student loan.

I once had a letting agent try to charge me for water damage in our bathroom.

I forwarded her the email where SHE had organised their handyman to fix the leak after I told her about it, and then a second email where SHE admitted the leak was due to the original installation of the pipe and nothing to do with us.

In the end, despite some cat-caused damage I would've happily paid for, I got 100% of my deposit back because the agent failed to supply any evidence at all the the 3rd party deposit holder.

That amount of money is roughly equivalent to everything we pay for education or everything we pay for pensions or - if you prefer - just a bit more than everything we pay for the EU, Overseas Aid, Culture and the Environment.

Interestingly, it is only slightly more than the amount we spend each year servicing interest payments on our debt - if we had a few decades of radical austerity to create a current account surplus (obviously ignoring that such a strategy might contract the economy while we did it) we could maintain almost exactly the same level of tax and spending as we have now without running a deficit.

I agree with your sentiment but disagree with your solution, granting special rights to certain groups is a recipe for resentment, not acceptance.

A business should have to serve anyone who shows up unless they fall in to special categories like gender specific services. Unless the proprietor can offer a reason from that list of special cases, they should have to serve me. It shouldn't be that gay people are protected, but straight people aren't, or that white people are but black people aren't - just make a law that covers everyone and only outlines the possible exceptions.

FFP limits how much we can spend. My comment, if you read it again, is relevant because they have a shitload of money to spend on keeping players. the red sox have a valuation well over a billion dollars. lfc have a valuation of 400 m dollars. they have plenty of money...

how did net spend get thrown into this argument? 

agree, that mentality needs to be taken ignored by the club, especially BR who i know will be looking to continue his run of results. 

Suarez was a big asset, but he was never going to stay, getting 75m for him was an incredible sum of money, and we certainly have spent a lot better than spurs did post bale. it is obvious already that our signings have been better. position by position comparison

marko has been better than lamela, and that's not saying a lot because marko has just started playing well. 

lovren is better than chiriches, and considering chiriches is about to get sold on, i think lovren is the better option.

emre can is better than paulinho already. nuff said. 

eriksen was a better buy adn better value than lallana, but lallana is a quality player who is just overshadowed by a supreme talent. eriksen was a big miss for us, wish we had signed him. 

im pretty sure, even though they've barely scored, balotelli and lambert have scored more from open play than soldado. lol...but seriously for 30m, soldado cost more than balo and lambert and can only score on pks...horrible buy from spurs, shocking really. plus soldado is no spring chicken. balotelli at least still has potential to show his world class talent whereas soldado is done. 

origi is one for the future, could be a future top 5 player if what everyone says is true. markovich the same. 

anyways, i think it's clear that our buys have performed better overall than the spurs buys did in their first season, and a big difference, too, is how young most of our players are. 6 of our signings were under 25...

anyways that was a tangent, point of my reply being: the owners will keep the squad together unless there is some serious unrest, and even if there is unrest, we have the financial power to keep players against their will because they are not scared to hold players to their contracts.

Suddenly, employers can pay what a job is actually worth, and still find people willing to do it. The result is likely to be lower unemployment and more economic growth. Growth means increased tax revenues - so there's not necessarily any need to raise taxes on those who were already in work, even if the scheme *does* end up costing more money than the system it replaces.

&gt; Because it has historically been used in a very racist way. The same way as 'nigger' has. There's a huge amount of racist baggage.

That's news to me. Nigger, of course, I knew about. But I've spent my life thinking coloured was a non-antagnostic word and have never been criticized for using it. 

For those of us who are simply ignorant - not deliberately abusive - do modern 'people of colour' (as you say) expect us to be up to date on this, when it's not a swear word by any stretch? 

As you go on to say... I've no problem with being described as a white person by (anyone else) - it's what I am. So what? 

The main difference seems to be histories of racial discrimination in some countries (the US, the UK...) against black people (or people of colour, if you like). 

What I do take exception to is the idea I should be in any way answerable for these histories that I had and have no involvement in.

&gt; It shouldn't be that gay people are protected, but straight people aren't, or that white people are but black people aren't - just make a law that covers everyone and only outlines the possible exceptions.

That's pretty much the case now.

And how can you even say that about Ivanovic. He's solid. Remember he's playing next to Cahill. He can't do the work for two.

What annoys me slightly more is the 90% back passes we are doing. Even 20m from goal, players suddenly get an urge to play the ball backwards, and suddenly it's with Courtois... In my opinion this invites high pressure from the opposing team. But why invite high pressure if you're not going to punish it by skipping past their players. Willian might be guilty of this, but even more Felipe Luis, who can't seem to play a through ball to save his life. 

The only one I really admire for trying to punish pressure is Hazard who will not back down. And generally he succeeds. My impression is that he has more of a 50/50 attitude to back passes and counter pressure.

It seems to me that letting agents have a nice little scam going on. They run a tiny office somewhere, advertise houses in a window and on a website, and they spend minimal time and effort showing people around. They treat potential tenants like criminals, and sting them with big fees. As we've seen, often they'll just turn people down without even asking the landlord if he/she is happy with the situation. I appreciate they are meant to deal with the hassle, but it seems to me that most of them contribute very little. Most don't even deal with emergencies - simply ditching that responsibility into the tenant to call an emergency plumber or whatever, and then you inevitably squabble about who pays for it later.

Forcing them to at least get off their arses and try to compete would be a good step in the right direction.

Few people have employers making PAYE that isn't a larger reduction than £72 per week.  Obviously we don't know what the number they would set this threshold at it, but it can't be high.  Even today if you are earning say £12k per anum, employers make net payments of about £30 per week (from memory, might be wrong a bit).

Their whole argument about why it's affordable is that progressive taxation takes it back from most.  Thus I'd guess most people who are working a job that has PAYE will mean they see no real change.  People will be upset if they have to pay more tax after all.

Dispensing it via PAYE is therefore, I'd assume, not fesable for many of their goals such as replacing JSA.

null,false,dirtyewok,num26,,null,"Thing with Lyon is......it was almost destined to be a brutal negotiation.

Aulas and Lyon are essentially the golden child of Soccernomics/Money-ball football...they don't spend money (something like £19m in the past 4 years for incoming transfers) to bring players in, they are invested in their youth, they use a transfer committee to determine moves, players (any player) are sold if the offer is substantial enough (buy low, sell high) and most importantly...they are successful. Lyon in many ways is exactly what Levy would want Spurs to be, a self sufficient club that competes with the billionaire big boys on a budget.

Problem with Levy/Spurs dealing with Lyon is that the philosophies are so similar to each other that they basically fly in the face of each other.....Aulas/Lyon are going to try for the absolute maximum for each and every transfer they are involved in. On the other hand Levy/Spurs are going to try to ensure that they do not overpay by a single £ on any transfer.

We (as a fan base) joke about Levy negotiating with Roman (because of apparent personal issues) or Lerner, Kenwright and Huw Jenkins (because of being cheap) as a nightmare negotiation....but Aulas and Levy....that is a match made in hell, i could see either of them bickering over who pays for the ink used in the fax machine or why the parking wasn't validated.

I don't think we ""majorly pissed off"" Lyon when we bought Lloris, i just think the two chairmen are too similar to each other for any negotiation to result in anything other than a drawn out and frustrating exchange.  I have no doubt that they would do business with each other again but i also have no doubt that the negotiation would be drawn out and painful and not something either would look forward to.

Technically Northern Ireland is British. It is a member state/province/country of the United Kindgom. It's citizens are born British citizens whether they like it or not, and they must apply to become Irish citizens. (see nationality law). We don't have dual nationality by default, we are merely entitled to become Irish citizens with the minimum of fuss. Don't confuse British and Great Britain in the same way that I'm Irish (geographically and socially), but not Irish (politically). It's commonplace to not distinguish between the two.

So yes, Northern Ireland is British, currently, and I fully appreciate that up to half the population aren't happy with that fact. It isn't opinion, it's fact and I don't understand how you can realistically argue that it isn't, whether you like it or not.

While I personally find the direction of travel in the Labour policy promising, the detail - and my experience of how things actually work is surprisingly worrying to me.

There's little mention of policy detail in today's new items and I know I'll be following closely - but previous Labour policy was to merge Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) with Local Authorities (LAs). In theory this enables social care and other LA responsibilities plus CCG NHS services to be run under one roof and could encourage full integration of services.

In practice, the NHS and Social Care already works incredibly closely together, especially since the recent push on integrated care and the 'Better Care Fund'. In my experience, LAs have far more bureaucracy and process than the local NHS and any transfer of NHS services to the LAs is likely to slow down NHS changes and responsiveness to local needs. The way LAs conduct themselves is heavily regulated, with entire teams of governance staff dealing with their committee's and groups. Yes - LAs possibly conduct their business more transparently in some ways, but there's also much more potential for things to be hidden in swathes of documentation or corrupted with local politics at play.

Which leads me on to the potentially even bigger issue - that with the NHS transferred to local Councillor control, the NHS is even more open to local politics than it ever has been before. We now don't just have to worry about the impact of national politics on our work, but also local politicians. And while yes - that's always been a part of the job, it's one thing to have a local Councillor campaigning against a service change or building closure, it's another for them to sit on the Committee deciding on it.

I'm all for the further integration of health and social care - although there is virtually no reliable evidence that it will reduce costs from similar initiatives around the world. What I personally want though is for this integration to happen under an independent, open and evidence based organisation, not the Local Authority.

I want the politics to be reduced in the NHS - not increased. If that could happen, we could be honest about, for instance, the integration of health and social care - there are studies that indicates it impacts on the quality of services, safety and patient experience heavily. Which is a great thing - we should be emphasising that, not pinning hopes on that it reduces costs when it's unlikely to.

There's a similar situation with the 'privatisation laws'. The 2012 Health and Social Care Act did not strongly affect existing regulations with regards to NHS procurement. Yes, it reinforced guidance that had been in place for years, but there was not anything significantly new in there in practice. Locally, we've not handed over a single contract to a private provider - indeed 3 have actually come back to NHS run social enterprises or NHS providers instead since the legislation.

For me personally, I'd like to see NHS providers as the 'first option' provider, but the bigger picture is ensuring that whatever provider is the highest quality and provides the best, most appropriate patient experience. This isn't impossible to achieve under current legislation, but does require more work and external legal advice to ensure that our service specification and tender processes are in line with law. The standard procurement process tends to lean heavily towards value for money and experience in producing bids on the provider side. This is why private providers tend to be successful and NHS organisation often fail, a private provider may have an entire team dedicated to bidding for contracts with in house legal advice, while NHS organisations often have to bring in interim expertise every 4 years to deal with it - or make do with staff who only do it every 4 years.

Lastly, I'm not sure many of us can stand another re-organisation. I'm now doing more or less the same job but employed by the 4th organisation in 5 years. If there's another re-organisation this year, that's 5 for 5...",null,0,null,1422372459,null,0,false,0,co2erdc,null,t3_2ttmxp,null,t1_co2erdc,null,t1_co2d398,null,null,null,1424363825,null,3,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,3,null

It's the United Kingdom of Great Britain AND Northern Ireland. To be British, you would have to be from Britain, and Northern Ireland isn't in Britain. 


&gt;It's citizens are born British citizens whether they like it or not, and they must apply to become Irish citizens.


Not true, we are by default UK citizens as Northern Ireland is a principality of the United Kingdom. Anyone, including a Unionist, can apply for an Irish passport, become an Irish citizen and still live in the North and use British services like the NHS. It's quite complicated, but that's the way it is. 



&gt;Don't confuse British and Great Britain in the same way that I'm Irish (geographically and socially), but not Irish (politically). It's commonplace to not distinguish between the two.



Citizenship in Northern Ireland is a complicated thing. I have an Irish passport, and yet I live in the North using resources from a British government. 


&gt;So yes, Northern Ireland is British, currently, and I fully appreciate that up to half the population aren't happy with that fact.


It's not British geographically or politically, which is why it is unfair for only a union flag to be on state buildings. The good Friday agreement guaranteed a shared society between Irish Nationalists and unionists.

  It's the largest performing arts festival in the world I think, way beyond comedy, there is stand-up, improv, theatre, music, dance, poetry, you name it, practically 24/7, in hundreds of venues and spilling onto the streets.  It is very amazing but there are some catches:

1) 07-31 August 2015, which isn't really the fall  
2) accomodation gets very expensive and booked up far in advance

Besides that I wouldn't have any specific recommendations for culture and comedy, any reasonably sized city is going to have events going on...

History is also still so epically vague and omnipresent I don't know where to start!  I suppose you could look at ticking a few key things through the ages -

- somewhere prehistoric (Stonehenge/Avebury are obvious, there are lots of lesser known stone circles tho, including some really atmospheric ones in the Lakes and Scotland)
- somewhere Roman (Hadrian's Wall?  that will provide you with beautiful landscape/walking)
- a medieval castle (this category is a particularly good excuse to visit Wales, imo)
- a medieval cathedral (York and Canterbury are the 'most important' but you may prefer discovering a lesser visited place like Lincoln or Hereford...)
- a grand Downton Abbey style stately home (Chatsworth is always a classic, Blenheim Palace is completely ridiculous, etc)
- industrial revolution - Ironbridge gorge or New Lanark are some UNESCO-starred examples, or there's heaps of stuff in the Potteries, Liverpool/Manchester, canals, docks, etc

anyways when sturridge comes back, he'll slot straight into the current formation as the lone striker, but what's beautiful is that sturridge gives us that element of surprise and allows us to play a 4-4-2 diamond with balotelli. should be interesting to see what happens...if balo catches form in february and has a blinder of a 2nd half of the season, we might be having a conversation about how many teams are after him and how he was a catalyst to a cup treble and missing top 4 escape act...heres to hoping all strikers catch a little form (lambert and borini have finally scored) and a very very healthy competition and raising of the standard required now that sturridge is back",null,0,null,1422373767,null,0,false,0,co2fgpr,null,t3_2tuavu,null,t1_co2fgpr,null,t1_co2e5h4,null,null,null,1424363499,null,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3,null

People who have been historically oppressed often take control of previously oppressive terms to reduce their power, reasserting their ownership over them.

The TARDIS lands on a deserted planet, and the Doctor emerges with a small box with a button.  He pushes the button and throws the box onto the ground, and it turns into a small room with a door.  (It resembles the ""zero"" room from the 5th Doctor!  But it's needlessly different in some superficial detail like concavity or radius, because new Doctor Who).  The doctor then paints the room with Clara explaining that whatever makes paint dry will have to get into the room in order to dry it.  Until then, they need to wait and watch the walls.  They've got to watch paint dry.  All day long. 

They watch the paint dry and the screen shows only the wall that they're looking at.  Meanwhile the Doctor and Clara provide a voice-over-only clip show (no visuals, we the audience only see paint on the wall, not drying) detailing their time together.  At the very end, cut to Clara looking to the Doctor at her side, he's still looking forward.  The camera is zoomed in on his eyes from the side as he's looking forward.  ""LOOK!""  Clara spins around to see some alien holding a hairdryer next to a completely dry wall.  It hisses and chases them out of the room.

I moved here in September too so thought I would weigh in. 

Accommodation. I found that looking for a flat was quite difficult actually. They seem to disappear quite quickly after being advertised (some don't even get that far). As far as areas go, most people seemed to recommend that I stay in clifton which is a really nice part of town. I actually ended up staying just off the harbourside which is also great. A lot of the guys I work with seem to work around the Gloucester Road area close to the bearpit. I was also told that I should probably avoid at Paul's. But I can't really comment cause I've never been to that part of town. 

Cabot Circus seems to be like the main shopping centre but I wouldn't say it's the middle of town. Walking from there down towards the hippodrome should give you a better idea of the town centre. There's a square there with fountains and stuff that I consider the centre of town. 

Good nights out. Clifton is pretty good. Plenty young studenty types about (although that is more or less true everywhere.) Also park street has a bunch of bars and restaurants etc which is where I normally go. There are also a bunch of places around the harbourside area. 

Wow. That turned into a novel. I guess some people who have lived in bristol for a while might be more useful.

I'm white and I'd expect everyone to know by this point that 'coloured' is an outdated and pretty offensive word with a lot of baggage attached to it. I'm genuinely surprised to find so many people in this thead who apparently didn't know it.

&gt;The main difference seems to be histories of racial discrimination in some countries (the US, the UK...) against black people (or people of colour, if you like).

That's the main difference, yes. The historical use of the word and the connotations it carries from its past use.

&gt;What I do take exception to is the idea I should be in any way answerable for these histories that I had and have no involvement in. 

No one is saying you're responsible for slavery or anything, just that you probably shouldn't use the word slavers and other historical oppressors used.

&gt;We don't challenge modern German people to apologize for the actions of the Third Reich - it would be ludicrous and ignorant to do so - I believe the same holds true here.

Where you should live really depends on your budget and where you are working/studying. 

Cabot Circus is not the main part of town (unless you love spending time in shopping centres). Cabot Circus, Broadmead and the centre are all quite ugly and I rarely go to any. A lot of 20 somethings spend most time on the harbourside, Park Street, Clifton and St Michaels Hill areas. 

My good nights out tend to be pubs rather than clubs, so I am not the best person to answer this maybe. But St Michaels Hill across Whiteladies Road and into Clifton is a good area for nice pubs. But there are nice pubs in every part of the city really. Stokes Croft is sort of 'edgy' but I have never had any problems on nights out there. No. 51 Stokes Croft does really nice and quite cheap pizza if you like that. The only club I have been to recently was the Big Chill on Small Street, which i really liked. But I dont know what you are into. http://wearebigchill.com/venues/bristol/

Sport? No idea! But if you like to be outdoors and maybe go running then head to the Downs or to Long Ashton/Leigh Woods.

&gt;

&gt;__Dunluce Castle__ (from [Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_language): *Dún Libhse*)  is a now-ruined medieval [castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle) in Northern Ireland. It is located on the edge of a [basalt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basalt) outcropping in [County Antrim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Antrim) (between [Portballintrae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portballintrae) and [Portrush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portrush)), and is accessible via a bridge connecting it to the mainland. The castle is surrounded by extremely steep drops on either side, which may have been an important factor to the early Christians and Vikings who were drawn to this place where an early Irish fort once stood.

“Is the hon. Gentleman really saying that in all those circumstances, whatever they might be, full planning permission should be required simply to change the use of a former pub to something that may be of benefit to the community?”

“The Government are proposing to look at the public houses that are genuinely popular and valued by the community now, giving them the protection that is already allowed under the Localism Act, and further enhancing that protection under the planning laws, saying, “You cannot convert this pub into another use or demolish it without planning permission.”

“That should address all the worries that people rightly have about the pubs that really are important to them.”

null,false,ZeNuGerman,null,null,null,"Hi, fellow expat with a couple of years of Bristol under my belt.  
  
Gloucester Rd., specifically Stokes Croft, is where it's at. By far the best night clubs, pubs and late bars (Lakota, Cozies, Canteen). There are some good clubs in the centre, too (specifically Mr. Wolfs, and Timbuk2). It's Bristol's alternative/ hippy quarter, with a great if slightly Trustafarian neighbourhood thing going (the People's Republic of Stoke's Croft). It is also chock-full of art galleries, graffiti, fantastic live acts, popup shops and general character.  
It's also not more or less rough than any other part of town- I would actually think that your chances to be beaten up are highest in the centre (near the fountains) and indeed on Park Street when the out-of-townies come in for a pissup. As far as mugging goes, that can happen literally anywhere.  
People keep pissing their pants at going through St. Pauls and Montpelier at night, IMHO this is bullshit unless you're afraid of a couple of crackheads and a really cool Jamaican community. Have a bit of situational awareness, get a hoodie, don't flash your shit and don't ask people at night in a thick accent where you could exchange 10,000 Kiwi dollars, and you'll be just fine.  
The one ""dodgy"" area remaining in the centre is Easton, the lower end of Stapleton Rd. is still an open crack and sex market, so I would not go down that street at night alone. Again, no problem in a group of three, muggers prefer easy (drunk and alone) targets (that said, I'm often both at the end of the night, never had an issue).  
Clifton is a very nice, but very expensive and superboring area, same for Redland and anything close to Whiteladies Rd. (where the idiots with popped collars park their pimped-up dick extension to score a student).  
Bristol doesn't really have a ""centre"" centre, but the shopping district (called Broadmead) is definitely not it. It turns into a soulless, empty desert at night, and is for my liking actually much, much dodgier than Gloucester Rd. to walk (coz no-one there, everything closes at 6 pm).  
Potential centres would indeed be:  
  
- Gloucester Rd for hippies/ alternative culture  
- St. Nick's market/ fountains for some of the clubs or bars, but more chavs about  
- Park Street for no reason at night, it just sucks. However, it is the centre if you're in Uni  
- Clifton Village is another mini-centre, very nice and posh, some good restaurants and bars if you want to impress the ladies

Lectures are organised by the faculty, and exams are written by the faculty. Seminars, too, are faculty-organised. Supervisions *are* organised by college, so who your supervisor is for a paper is affected by which college you are at, but you're not inherently going to get a worse supervisor because it's a mature college. 

College life will be different at a mature college vs. other colleges: there will be proportionately fewer undergrads, for instance. But college life depends on many other factors -- life at Corpus Christi (with approx 470 students, in the centre of town) is entirely different to life at Homerton (1,200 students, far to the south), and neither of those are graduate colleges. 

The perception of your degree should be the same, whichever college you go to: because the degree is awarded by the university, and all students take the same exams no matter which college they are at, there is no difference between a degree from Trinity and one from Lucy Cavendish.

1: 'It costs money'  

Duh. [Here's](https://www.dropbox.com/s/c839aq9wqgjqh6g/Costing%20Citizens%E2%80%99%20Income%20for%202015%20manifesto%203.0%20copy.pdf) an idea of how you could fund it.

2: It is geographically unfair. 

Again, Duh. The current UK is. Housing Benefits are being proposed to be kept, so people can still live somewhere. But as a bigger point: this is not necessarily a disadvantage. You want to make your BI go further? Move to somewhere cheaper and spend your money in the local economy there.

3: It's a poverty income, those who can't work are worse off. 

The funding proposal above suggests keeping most benefits for disabled people. Also; you've got to start somewhere, but if you keep the benefits listed in the above costing you don't push into poverty people who actually can't work. They will be no worse off. 

4: Tying the income to citizenship. 

There is no other way to manage it, and I don't see how it's unfair to immigrants. Or particularly how they will be 'victimized' by not receiving a citizens income.

5: It's not high enough and so McDonald's can argue it is allowed to pay poverty wages if people won't starve. 

This is a pretty poorly substantiated point: we barely have any private sector strikes as it is, how can removing the indignity of claiming benefits make this any worse? People aren't in unions as it is, and just because business *can* argue something doesn't mean that it will succeed. 

No one is suggesting removing the minimum wage at *this level* of basic income(People do for much higher BI that would effectively meet minimum wage). 

Although there is a danger of it being too low, and not particularly affecting the worker - employer dynamic sufficiently. One of the biggest benefits of a sufficient BI is that it would change the power dyanmics, no longer does the employer have the ability to threaten starvation and homelessness if you don't agree terms of employment. If BI isn't high enough this dynamic won't change *enough* to be meaningful. However claiming that the proposed level of BI is going to make the current situation worse is unsubstantiated; and I think it is likely that if implemented the level will rise gradually. You've got to start somewhere.  ",null,0,null,1422377168,null,0,false,0,co2hek8,null,t3_2tu8s3,null,t1_co2hek8,null,t3_2tu8s3,null,null,null,1424362503,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

Things which I really like about Cambridge:

* The supervision system: as a historian, you'd almost certainly have individual supervisions with your supervisors, who are frequently experts in their field.

* Provision of libraries/academic resources: the combination of the university library, faculty libraries (in your case the history faculty library, but also depending on which papers you take possibly the classical faculty, English faculty, divinity faculty, economics faculty, and philosophy faculty library (all have been helpful to me as a historian)), and the college library means that you always have access to the books you want or need for your studies. Especially given that the UL is a legal deposit library, and has the most books on open stacks of any library in the country.

* The city itself. It's not as big as e.g. London, but the atmosphere is lovely, the architecture is beautiful, and it very much caters for students considering that there are two universities in what is not actually that large a city.

I do agree with you that there is masses of demand in the colloquial sense (lots of people want to live in British houses) but that isn't the same as demand in the economic sense (people with both the desire and the means). Fundamentally the value of house prices in the UK must surely be linked to the earnings of British people, because if people aren't earning enough money then no matter how much 'demand' there is in the sense of people wanting to live somewhere, that won't translate into 'demand' in the sense of people being able to pay to live there. If only some people are in that situation then it's tough luck for them, but if nearly everyone is then the prices have to come down until enough people can afford it. (this argument applies to renting rather than buying, but these two things have to be linked, because even if the only people who own houses are rich investors they'll still want some return on their money)

I'm hoping they've revisited their original thoughts in light of the more recent integrated care and Better Care Fund (BCF) initiatives that are now underway.  I'd imagine that the trials you refer to fall under the BCF, it's kind of a big deal here right now - and is definitely a step in the right direction.  Under those schemes, local NHS organisations have formed working groups with Local Authority teams and each partner has transferred budgets under the groups control.  It works because it's a partnership and isn't under the control of either the Local Authority or NHS, but requires discussion and agreement from all parties.

But I can't help but feel that those 2013 Labour suggestions would be a step backwards.  The NHS - and social care - has a lot of problems, yes.  And there's significant tinkering and changes that need to happen, even ignoring funding challenges and future care needs.  But locally, for us at least, the move into clinically led development of services has been fantastic and it would be a real shame to see clinical evidence driven, patient experience and outcome focused services be transferred into Local Authorities, under a bureaucratic leadership and subject to the whims of layers of Committees...

Of course, I could be wrong - and I'm sure there's plenty of people who feel the opposite way.

null,false,NervousEnergy,null,null,null,"Left wing vs right wing is a strange concept if you’ve not encountered it before: think of it like a spectrum of colour with lots of different ranges. The general idea is that:

&gt; **Right wing: pro-business, de-regulations, smaller state. Traditional social values.** 

&gt; **Left wing: pro-workers, more regulations, larger state. Progressive social values.** 

Centre politics is somewhere in the middle.

It’s obviously a lot more nuanced and complex than that, and most parties and people take bits from right wing *and* left wing policies.

I'd recommend http://voteforpolicies.org.uk/ (**THIS HASN'T BEEN UPDATED FOR 2015, ALL POLICIES ARE OUT OF DATE AND BASED OFF 2010 MANIFESTO**) which takes the old policies of the political parties in the UK and you can pick and choose which ones you agree with. It'll be updated soon for the 2015 policies.

But here's a brief run-down, hopefully as unbiased as possible, on the major and minor political parties in the UK.

**The Labour Party**: formed in 1900 as a party representing the views of the urban proletariat. With heavy influence from the Trade Unions and socialist groups, the party was traditionally that of the working classes and the poor. Policies were based around labour laws (as the name suggests...), and was very pro-worker. Left leaning in both economic and social issues, they championed the nationalised industries of the UK. In the 1970s they were hit hard with the strikes that brought Britain to a standstill, and many people saw that the trade unionists had taken over the party and were going too far in their demands. They were ousted out of power for a full 18 years and were seen to be floundering. ""New Labour"" was formed in the early 1990s, as a way to drag the party into the modern age by moving policies into the centre (third-way politics), so as to be more attractive to the broad middle class voters. Tony Blair was the most famous of the New Labourites, and he became Prime Minister in 1997 in a landslide election. During his Premiership, we saw Labour move further into the centre, and take on some 'right wing' policies such as fairly draconian surveillance and anti-terror laws. New Labour was also quietly against state control of industries, and promoted capitalism and businesses. Discontent over the Iraq/Afghanistan War, the deficit, and Tony Blair, saw the New Labour brand become fairly toxic to the electorate and Labour was voted out in 2010. Ed Miliband, current Labour Leader, has been fairly derided in the press for being uncharismatic and for having no real policies. The Labour Party is unique in that it sort of has another independent political party *inside* it; The Co-Operative Party which, as the name suggests, stands for the co-operative movement. There is still a split between the New Labour/Blairites who advocate centre-policies, and the Old Labour group who are more traditionally left leaning. 

Currently the general policies of Labour are centre when it comes to economic issues, and slightly centre-left when it comes to social issues.  

**The Conservative Party**: formed in the 19th century as a faction of the Whig Party. Nicknamed ""The Tories"", referencing a political group from the 17th century. The party was generally for the land owners and upper and middle classes of the countryside, and exposed traditional social and religious values, pro business and capitalism. They followed Labour by embracing workers rights, but in the 1970s won a landslide under the Premiership of Margaret Thatcher, who fought hard to dismantle the Trade Unions; which she was quite successful in doing. Thatcher also took charge of privatising the nationalised industries (telecom, railways, power, water, steel, etc), which many people saw as ""selling off the country to the highest bidder"", although you have to understand that many of these industries in the county at the time were horribly bureaucratic, inefficient, and expensive to run. Thatcher also moved the UK economy from that of an exporter of heavy manufacturing to services, primarily financial. She saw we were unable to compete with the developing nations when it came to cutting manufacturing costs. She adopted a free market policy, promoting businesses and entrepreneurship. However, after 11 years in power and a split within the party, she was finally ousted out in a leadership challenge in 1990. In the 21st century, the Conservatives have modernised their image to appeal to a wider base of voters. Socially they have adopted some traditional left policies, such as gay marriage. David Cameron, in his Premiership, saw tackling the deficit and restarting the economy as the main issues. He has shrunk the state, and has continued to privatise parts of the economy, continuing the promotion of businesses and capitalist ideals. He has been much criticised for welfare reforms, and the rise of 'zero-hour' contracts and short-term employment. There is a certain split in the party between the progressive conservatives, and the traditional right wing faction.

Currently the general policies of the Conservatives are centre-right when it comes to economic issues, and centre when it comes to social issues.

**The Liberal Democrats**: formed in the 1980s as a merger between two liberal parties. As the name suggests the Lib Dems are a social-liberal party with left-leaning policies. They were always the smallest party of the main three, and especially in the beginning were often seen as a 'protest' vote. They appealed mainly to the young and middle classes, with policies promoting environmentalism, progressive taxation, and liberal social and political reform. Social liberalism has always been an important stance, although economically the party is split between 'Orange Bookers' who promote businesses and laissez faire economics, and the 'Social Liberals' who advocate state intervention and more socialist ideals. After much media attention during the 2010 election cycle, the Lib Dems were seen as 'The Kingmaker'; able to go into a coalition with either Labour or Conservatives to ensure an electoral victory. In the end they became the junior partner in the current Coalition Government with the Conservative Party, a partnership seen by many Lib Dem voters as betrayal considering the policies and ideology between both parties were nearly opposite. Nick Clegg, leader of the Liberal Democrats and Deputy Prime Minister, was much derided for breaking his 'electoral promise' on rising university tuition fees; under this Government fees have tripled. As such, the student voters (which made up a large percentage of the Lib Dem electorate) fled the party and support plummeted. In the coalition, the Lib Dems has been seen as dampening several right wing policies of the Conservatives and introducing several liberal policies (such as rising the tax threshold). Unfortunately their main political stance, electoral reform, failed at a public referendum. 

Currently the general policies of the Liberal Democrats are left-wing socially, and centre economically; although supporters would say they don't fit into either and instead are all about ""Liberalism"". 

**Minor Parties**

**United Kingdom Independence Party**: formed in 1993 as a ""single issue"" party; being against the European Union and what they saw as dangerous integration, and the giving up of national sovereignty to the European Parliament. They want to withdraw from the EU, and this is their main electoral promise. Seen as a minor fringe party for most of their years, they gained sudden traction in 2013 and won several local council elections. Discontent with the EU and the Coalition Government saw them gaining big wins in the 2014 EU elections, and membership and vote-share prediction continue to go up and up. Current polls put them at 15% - 20% of the national vote, which is a massive rise in such a short period of time. UKIP, as they are known, are a right-wing party which has populist policies. They aim at the working classes, saying that Labour no longer represents their interests. They are also libertarian; wanting a much smaller state and promoting capitalism and free market economics. However several of their social policies are right wing instead of libertarian, such as being against gay marriage. They are much seen as representing ""traditional British values"", and wanting to cut down heavily on immigration which they see unintegration as a huge threat to the social and economic fabric of society. Several members have been called out for spouting racist, sexist, or homophobic ideas in private and in public, probably because being a fringe party for so long has attracted lots of fringe members. 

Currently, the general policies of UKIP are right-wing socially and right-wing economically. 

**The Green Party**: Three independent parties representing England &amp; Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. As the name suggests, they promote environmentalism above all others. Part of the world-wide Green movement, founded in the 1970s, the Green Party is socially and economically liberal and left-wing. They want state ownership of key industries/utilities, sustainability in resources, and progressive social and political change. To this end they have policies such as cutting the defence budget, lowering the national speed limit, banning GM crops, banning nuclear power, and banning testing on animals. The party is split between the 'watermelons' who want less extreme policies to promote to the majority of the electorate, and the 'kiwis' who still support the rather extreme green policies such as mandatory vegetarianism. They won a seat in the last General Election and have seen a surge in support, with a lot of disgruntled Liberal Democrats joining them as the only other left-wing party in England. Like UKIP they have lots of extreme/fringe members and policies.

Currently, the general policies of The Greens are left-wing socially and left-wing economically. ",null,0,null,1422379779,null,0,1422380442,0,co2izq4,null,t3_2tusvs,null,t1_co2izq4,null,t3_2tusvs,null,null,null,1424361761,null,13,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,13,null

That's not really any different though...  
The idea is to give every British citizen a guaranteed Basic Income with no conditions. (Other than age.)
What you are suggesting is basically a [Negative Income Tax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_income_tax) which is functionally very similar. 

The BI is, in my opinion  better because it is more [universal](http://reidfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/The-Case-for-Universalism.pdf). It is simpler to administer and avoids the edge cases that would come with a NIT i.e. when does the income swap to a tax deduction.

And what difference does it make if someone is paid a guaranteed income or it is a tax break? Their take home money will be functionally the same. And a Basic Income would, ironically, be much simpler to administer, and be simpler for people to work out their take home pay too. Any work at all means you get more money. And how much more is just (wage -tax).

The author is talking about something that has been discussed a lot here in recent weeks - our defensive midfield. Obviously, we have been exposed there, especially when Matic has not played. The author implies that Fabregas does not provide enough defensive cover in the holding midfield. While I agree that he's not the best defensive player, the attacking threat he provides distributing the ball is absolutely top class (as evidenced by his blowing away the PL assist category).


Playing Fabregas as a ""defensive"" midfielder shows Mourinho's desire to attack teams, as a team of our caliber should do in almost every match. I don't think there is a single player in the world that has Matic's defensive capabilities combined with Fabregas's attacking capabilities; therefore, any player we might put in that role with Matic to shore up the defense is going to be a step down offensively.

In my experience of a bipolar and a (different) clinically depressed family member you can't really.  You will be perceived as the biggest arsehole because you didn't wake them for lunch, or because you did wake them and they were finally getting rest.

None of these cartoons have the illustration that someone is being a lazy prick.  Instead they have people applying poor verbal advice to a psychical condition.  I feel that isn't really fair.  Normally, at least for me, people apply poor verbal advice to a condition that is often helped by good verbal advice a little bit.

I don't know what kind of illnesses you've experienced, but I've found, and been rather good at, enabling people if you are too soft, exacerbating if you aren't.

&gt;I don't see how that fits the point of the comic

Maybe why I didn't like the comic.  I'm thinking of a classic battle I've had with 3 friends who don't like taking their tablets.  If someone vomits after taking important medication, it's a simple case of *has any of it started to break down* type work.  If someone refuses to take their SSRIs say, what do you do, it's a difficult moral issue, and I think it better portrays the issues of dealing with someone who is mentally ill.  Most people who suffer a little bit of food poisoning, are not massive cunts as one of their symptoms.  Sadly, the two people I've known who suffer from clinical depression are.  Almost consistently.  Bipolar is odd because sometimes, during a high mania they can be the most loving, caring, excited, enthusiastic, enjoyable person to be around.  Then moments later, you are stopping them from slashing their wrists.

This comic, frankly trivialises the relationship.  I don't get upset because someone doesn't respect that I have asthma, I educate them as to what it means and how best to say, having a 100 mile cycle ride with me and work with that.  I don't get upset with them because it's simple and easy, but also, and this is the key point I don't expect them to understand it perfectly.",null,0,null,1422383639,null,0,false,0,co2le4a,null,t3_2tudq7,null,t1_co2le4a,null,t1_co2kzin,null,null,null,1424360641,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

I hate being called a ""Half Breed"" or ""Half Cast"" ""Paki"" ""Nigger"" etc. and so I use it myself, as do my mom and dad and my closest friends BUT not in public and not around people we don't really know all too well.

Like...Imagine growing up and having people shout abuse at you, calling you a dirty nigger, or a filthy half breed. It hurts a LOT. So in making light of it, like I said, it dulls it slightly so that it scars you a little less.

Now, when a random person starts saying shit like ""Whats up mah nigger?"" Thinking that it's funny or acceptable because they've heard others saying it, I get...not quite angry but...miffed. My friends and family can say it because they've experienced it.

I've volunteered with a range of organisations relating to my field, they all say the same thing, ""employees want skills and volunteering is the best way to get into this field"". My field is a little different than yours but the advice is hopefully useful. 

Think of it from their perspective, great you've got a PhD but do you know how to use a photocopier for a stupid example, that's essentially what the deal is. They don't want to spend time and money training you when someone else can do it, it's ridiculous but there you go. 

To me you should be focusing on the programming, train yourself with some more languages, focus on a couple. I'm sure you know already but there are some good free training websites out there. Can you find a charity or something that needs help with some IT related stuff, even shoving data together, could be totally boring but shows to an employer that yes I can do what I say I can. For example a charity I was with needed data analysis to see if/how their management techniques were working on a nature reserve. 

You can still claim jobseekers allowance and volunteer (which you should apply for if you're not already!). It'll get you out of the house, meet people and help you learn some new skills, and show to employers that you're trying and able. 

Focus on your IT skills, make sure you highlight these as many employers are looking for IT literate staff. 

Don't give up and I know the volunteering thing sounds a bit pointless and not related but it could just help you in a way you weren't expecting. Plus it shows you're not just sat on your arse all day to employers...!

I tend not to believe this kind of transfer rumor, especially where chelsea is involved, and especially in the January window. No doubt Enner would play better in their system and with better players around him, but I don't see why Mourinho would bother with that much paperwork to bring him in now. He doesn't improve their side much, if at all. In fact one could probably argue with a degree of credibility that he might weaken their side.

Clearly it depends on the illness, but given that anxiety and depression are two of the most common types of disorders, I'll tackle those:

* The advice that you should change your frame of mind, mocked in this comic, is the basis for talk therapy, a highly effective means of treating depression and anxiety.
* Stephen Fry himself resisted medicine for several years on the very grounds that it would change who he was, and many who take medicine attest to a malign effects on how they feel about their sense of self. Given the link between mind and personality its hardly a trivial point.
* Getting out of bed and keeping occupied is also another common method of dealing with mental health issues, and is also something a shrink would advise for certain patients. (Though overwork can be just as bad.)

Just as there is a link between physical health and exercising, eating well and getting enough sleep, cultivating a healthy mind is something that will yield to the ""helpful advice"" suggested in this comic.

Part of the problem with going onto a 6 month contact is that you can no longer vacate with only 1 months notice.

null,false,JackXDark,null,null,null,"&gt;How about we reclaim words rather than abandon them?

Depends who the 'we' is. 

My work brings me into contact with a lot of people with disabilities. Some of them use the term 'crip' or even 'spaz'. If they were to, for example, use that in the title of a play or piece of writing I was involved in sorting out a website or some promotion for, I'd use it, sure, as that's their word and it's being set in a specific context. Am I **ever** going to suggest using that term or use it to refer to a person, as someone who doesn't have a disability, hell no.

I do use 'spastic' a lot though, when writing about cerebral palsy. Because that's a medical term to refer to the condition of muscles. Muscles are spastic and exhibit spasticity, not people, and the use is technically appropriate, but only when talking about muscle behaviour. It's the intent behind the word that matters sometimes, sure, but there's also a danger in using terms that people might be genuinely upset by, and if there's a different word to use, why upset someone?

Even something like saying 'handicapped' can be taken to mean 'cap in hand' as in, someone who gets by only by begging or is a scrounger. That's not actually the correct etymology, but it's why the word should be avoided. Seeing as there are alternatives, I don't especially have any desire to reclaim it or even try to argue the toss as to why it doesn't mean that.

null,false,hitchenator,null,null,null,"Living just near Montpelier station atm, probably one of the more rough areas of bristol but it's cheaper, and not too bad. There's always junkies in bear pit at night though, and the people look a bit rougher. I find you can actually grade the roughness of the area with the level of artistic ability in graffiti there. There's the occasional stabbing you'll hear about or something on Gloucester rd, but having lived in Manchester I'd say it's actually pretty tame considering what other people would tell you. Generally, clifton is the ""posh"" part of town, redland is the studenty area and montpelier is still quite studenty, though less so than redland and a bit cheaper. Just south of the river you'll find more of the young professional types, and up near stoke bishop/downs are nicer pricier areas (or so I've been told?). I'm perfectly happy living in montpelier, and bristol's starting to get *even more expensive*, so get the cheap places whilst you can. If you're alone, I'd consider getting a flat share, may help meet more people in the area too, and is certainly much cheaper than a single bed.

I'd say park street / uni is the centre of town, and think you'd be pushed to find a decent priced flat there.

Although gloucester road can be rough, there are good night outs. Big Chill is like a jazz bar, Lakota is a club that can be quite gritty and has some underground beats (dnb/dub nights), and timbuk2 is similar (but *actually* underground! Bass reflects off the arches really well). If you want a big night, can go to motion that's just near Temple meads, though it's usually quite a trek and the prices will reflect the type of events that's going on. 02 academy also host gigs, and have generic club nights regularly. You can also go to harbourside and go on Thekla, a club on a boat - They have a bunch of different nights from house to indie to rock, or if you're down there I'd suggest going to a pub called the apple - cracking cider, and half pints of bristolian for £1 if you've got a student card on weekdays. It's my fave pub in bristol, would recommend, the people are generally very friendly too if you fancy chatting, though it's very studenty mon-thurs. Clubs like syndicate and pryzm will generally tell you they're the biggest in bristol and the best, and whilst it's true they're very big, they're massively overrated.

If you're more into pubs, there's a couple in stokes croft that are quite cool like the crofters arms (may have gotten name wrong?), one near harbourside called the bag of nails featuring 11 cats/kittens with super friendly staff, cori tap is also pretty popular due to age and exhibition cider (do NOT go on a weekend late at night though - extraordinarily crowded, and you'll probably be drinking outside). There's also zero degrees where the last meetup was, though I've never been there. There's others, but those are the ones that come to mind.

Precisely what I did for approx 10 years. Fact is no one (my mates of a similar age being my only benchmark) is saving. Everyone is renting in trendy places, going out and getting wasted 3 nights a week, taking international holidays 2-3 times a year, travelling home to visit their folks. You go back to my parents generation and a lot of people came over to London to work. They lived in penury so they could save up and go back home and afford to live comfortably well.

I lived in a roomshare in a miserable, but well connected, part of London for a long time. House wasn't great but landlord was nice and so I was happy to tough it out. I had a skilled job that paid well and based on that started a side business to help out.

I fell for a girl who was similarly sensible. We managed to buy a place between us. Its now worth roughly 45% more than we paid for it and forecast to grow another 40% by 2020 (crossrail et al). 

A lot of that is going to seem like luck, but you can't win unless you get into it.

What really busts my balls in this SR is the number of people who are resenting rich arabs and russians buying £50 million properties. 

The fact of the matter is for the past 5 years London property has represented one of the single fastest, safest appreciating investments on the planet. Better than any savings account, better than any bond and more definite a win than any potential stock punt. That is going to make it desirable.

People on here say they want a house to live in, in London and they deserve it/ it is a human right. I contend that is not true.

There are a fuckton of cheap houses in this country but no one wants to live in shithole towns like the ones they grew up in. They suffer from extreme status anxiety where because they are, largely, white lower middle class and have come up to the big city and see that this isn't Stock-On-Trent (good) but that they can't just earn £30k a year and support a 4 person family like their dad did (bad). What can you possibly expect? Everyone in the country wants to be here.... how do you all suggest we regulate the population?

Should we have a hipster test to see if you can get into skinny jeans? Immigrants to the UK must be means tested,  perhaps we should do the same in London? Or perhaps we just let the market fight it out.

&gt; That's not actually the correct etymology

I'm wary of giving up on words because of stuff like this. I'm an editor by trade, and on more than one occasion I've been told that words such as 'nitty-gritty' and 'brainstorm' should be avoided because they're offensive to black people and epilepsy sufferers, respectively. Neither has any basis in its etymology and the pejorative meaning is an urban myth. I understand you've got better things to do with your life than argue the toss about whether a word is offensive, but my worry is that an increasing number of words are lost for want of a better dictionary. 

Incidentally with 'spastic' I believe US use of the word isn't deemed offensive in the same way it is in the UK – which highlights how contextual such things are (see also use of the term 'coloured' in South Africa).

For one, it's not just a matter of calling up a player and telling him he's coming to Chelsea. For two, it doesn't need to be that way. Every squad has highs and lows. Just because we're in a low (that's really only consisted of a few bad results) doesn't mean we're a bad team. 


It's not an accident that Mikel has been in and around our first team for a decade. It's not a mistake that Cahill has played almost every minute for the last two seasons. It's not poor talent evaluation that got Schurrle meaningful minutes for a World Cup-winning side.

I have had several interviews for data jobs, but like OP, I have no strong background in statistics. Sometimes this is a problem, especially if the position is not entry-level.

I've learnt that a PhD, unlike how I naively thought, does not entitle you to a higher starting salary without the skills to match it. Therefore, I have embarked on improving my knowledge/learning signal/data analysis, machine learning and programming. Udacity/Corsera

The key is not to give up and to keep yourself busy. I too don't really feel motivated about many of the companies/jobs I see advertised or know what I want to do. As for dreams and ambitions surely you must have some? Like wanting kids and getting married. I know that is a cliche but it keeps me going. 

My advice is to take some time out after your PhD and recharge. Your lack of ambition probably stems from burning out.

null,false,JunglistMassive,,GLORIOUS RED SAUCE ARMY,null,"&gt;  but it's foolish to think that no IRA man has ever been involved in drugs...

I'm not saying that what i am saying is that the IRA as an organisation were not involved in it. I have no doubt individual members and former members drifted into it. None of them where acting as the IRA in doing so. I have stated earlier the Head of Gardai Drugs Squad said there was no evidence that the IRA where involved in Drugs. 

In 2005

&gt;The head of the Garda National Drugs Unit, Det Chief Supt Cormac Gordon has said there is no evidence to suggest paramilitary figures are involved in drug dealing.
He said while there may be fears that some paramilitaries will turn to drug dealing now that the Provisional IRA has been stood down, there was no intelligence at present to suggest this was happening.[Source](http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-24804167.html)

Again in 2013

&gt;Garda sources last week said there has **never been any evidence of an organisational link between the IRA and drugs criminals** in the UK, but they are aware that former IRA members, including members of one well known family with both IRA and criminal links in south inner Dublin, has links to organised crime and drug dealers in Liverpool and the Midlands of Britain.[Source](http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/ira-druggang-linked-to-double-british-murder-26823015.html)

Every accusation, and mudslinging exercise relies on smoke and mirrors and a nod and a wink. Without any real evidence.  
If anything the IRA purposefully went on a moral however misguided crusade to rid the streets of drugs. What we are being told to believe is that the IRA played both sides of the fence, Running the drugs trade completely unhindered by the most heavily policed state in western Europe, whilst simultaneously shooting and kneecapping their customers and supply network, that to me is not a very good business plan.

If it were true then it would make no economic sense that there would invest so much of their time into Diesel Laundering and Cigarette smuggling, which the Police have routinely and spectacularly cracked down on, both of them offer less of a return than a the lucrative multi-billion pound Drugs Trade. If we are to believe as others have asserted here than the IRA dealt soft drugs and not Hard Drugs, arbitrarily drawing a moral line and therefore inhibiting their profit, yet there is no similar precedence of high profile or systematic arrests linking the IRA to the trade. As i stated earlier there have been 15,000 people arrested in connection with IRA activity over the years, that figure comes from Coiste Na Iarchimi, the ex-prisoner Support Group, not one of them is in connection to Drugs. /u/bawbawbaw1  bizarrely attributes this to the security services turning a blind eye. What interest does that serve to the security forces? Their aim was to smash the IRA, whether by conflict or in the Media war, the battle for hearts and minds, they have often inferred that the IRA was nothing more than a criminal gang, and that they where involved in the drugs trade. So why not catch them in the act, for all the world to see.

That's essentially how we play when Oscar's in, but Oscar's not defensively sound enough to effectively cover Fabregas when he moves further forward, as good as he is at pressing high up the pitch. So Matic ends up being the only shield for the defense, and it leaves us exposed. And when Matic goes forward, Fabregas shielding by himself leaves us even more exposed than that.

The only two players that I can think of that would drastically improve that situation are Pogba and Khedira, both of whom we were linked to this summer, but neither of whom seem like realistic options.",null,0,null,1422387430,null,0,false,0,co2nss7,null,t3_2ttqf4,null,t1_co2nss7,null,t1_co2i4aq,null,null,null,1424359518,null,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2,null

'Asian' tends to refer to people from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka - meaning that those originating from say Japan, Korea, China may sometimes be referred to as 'South East Asian' or 'Chinese or something' (not joking)

'(From) Ethnic minorities' gets used a fair bit in civil discussion.

According to statistics, the opposite of what you believe is true lithaborn;  Over the last 20 years there's in fact an increase in undiagnosed or failed treatment examples of mental illness (suicide).... If your 'worrying' trend were even slightly possible, surly there would be a decrease, or even a leveling off of suicides.

Now sure, some of these people might not have been mentally ill. Its possible that some were perfectly fine and just happened to recognize the inherent pointlessness of life... but if you think there's been a 60% increase in this realization over the last 40 years, well, you'd need some conspiracy theory to convince me.

By around 75' we're in a 4-1-2-2-1: we've taken off a CB for John Glenson at RB, Lucas holds the middle, Henderson and Gerrard are at the base of the ""square,"" and Lallana (on for Markovic) and Coutinho are behind Sterling at the top of the ""square."" Coutinho slides Sterling in but he is fouled and Gerrard sends a FK into the upper 90 at 84'.

In extra time, we take off Coutinho (who is on a yellow, after all) for Balotelli and switch to a 4-2-3-1 with Sterling and Lallana out wide. Everything is crammed into the midfield and Balotelli's hold up play gets us out of a sticky situation at 111'.

In penalties, Balotelli scores and Terry slips on his own feet and sends his kick screaming wide. From the away end you can hear:

One of the women in my office uses a wheelchair, and a few weeks ago, someone who'd injured himself doing some sports type thing was complaining about 'hardly being able to walk all weekend' and she came out with 'that's nothing, try 31 years without walking' and he was utterly mortified once he'd realised what he'd said, but she didn't really mind and was taking the piss out of him more than anything. 

Should we tiptoe around such things and be ultra-vigilant? Hell... am I wrong even to use 'tiptoe' there as a metaphor when some people may not be able to?

Nah, course not.

I initially signed up to one of their petitions when asked to do so by a professional colleague, regarding something that I have a close personal and work interest in myself. Their campaign looked knowledgeable and well put together, at least compared to some of the other bollocks that was flying around at the time...

...I then got my inbox bombed on every issue under the sun until I opted out. Firstly, it's not good if your emails are so frequent the default position becomes ""mark as read"" without reading. Secondly some of their material - IIRC the bees campaign was the one that really got my goat - was half-baked and simplistic. I'm a beekeeper. I know a bit about it! It's not as *simple* as that. Grrrr! 

Very difficult to avoid the conclusion that of a thousand people signing a 38Degrees campaign, eight hundred don't understand the issue beyond the level of a pretty basic emotional response, and probably one hundred will sign any damn thing put in front of them. 

This, of course, does not mean any particular campaign objectives are invalid. But it does undermine the credibility of petitions. I want public debate to be reasoned and well-informed, not a popularity contest.

Volunteering would be a good idea. I'm sure it would be helpful, as I don't have a lot of ""real world"" experience. How did you find charities/organisations to volunteer with? Did you just email places nearby, or were they advertised somewhere?

Thanks for the advice. I was trying to think of ways to learn the new skills in my current job, but I hadn't really thought about volunteering with charities etc. and applying them there instead.

null,false,Patch86UK,,Labour Member,null,"&gt;General elections are fought and won on the issue of the economy. And, while pollsters say this year’s general election looks too close to call, on this crucial issue the Conservatives seem to be in the lead. In large part, this is because the Tory charge against the last Labour government — that the economy was wrecked because the public finances spiralled out of control — is holding sway over voters.

&gt;It is understandable that the Conservatives, under George Osborne, the guileful chancellor, and Lynton Crosby, his election guru, should make this their mantra. What is less understandable is that Labour, under Ed Miliband and Ed Balls, his shadow chancellor, has been hesitant to rebut this charge. They have worked harder to distance themselves from New Labour than to defend its record. This hands the Tories a needless advantage. If Labour is to win in May, the two Eds need to set the record straight and reclaim ground foolishly bequeathed to their opponents.

&gt;The economic facts are on their side. Public spending accounted for about 40 per cent of gross domestic product during Margaret Thatcher’s years as prime minister. Under John Major it was 38 per cent; since 2010 it has been almost 41 per cent. Under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, the figure was 37 per cent.

&gt;The last Labour government could be considered one of the most prudent in modern times. After a decade in power it had cut the deficit and cut the national debt. Mr Osborne cannot have been unduly concerned about Labour spending plans when, in 2007, he committed the Tories to sticking to them. Among the Group of Eight rich countries, only Canada had less public debt.

&gt;Spending had to rise at the start of the last decade to correct the neglect that had gone before. New schools and hospitals were built to replace Victorian edifices that had been left to crumble. As spending increased, so did our national wealth. The economy grew every quarter for 11 successive years.

&gt;True, once the global financial meltdown hit, public spending rose considerably as a share of GDP — though it never quite reached the high water mark of 1981-83. In a severe recession, government support is needed to prevent millions from falling into hardship. In 2008, as in 1981, what caused the deficit to grow was not a spending splurge but a collapse in tax receipts.

&gt;In 2008 there was a desperate need to stop the collapse of our financial institutions. Labour prevented this catastrophe. Of course, the purse strings then needed to be tightened, as any government elected in 2010 would have found. One can debate the timing of this necessary correction; no doubt people will, between now and May. What does not stack up is the Tory claim that Labour lost control of public finances. The budget deficit after 2008 was a result, not a cause, of our economic problems. As Rachel Lomax, former deputy governor of the Bank of England, has said: “We have a public sector debt problem not because Gordon Brown went on a public spending spree but as a consequence of a private credit explosion, much of which was not even in this country.”

&gt;All is fair in love, war and election campaigns. The facts speak for themselves. But politicians try to torture them until they confess a different story. We hope the facts will prove resilient.

&gt; Your two Links, one is an Ex-member of the now defunct PIRA who is in his sixties. The other is was a member of RIRA who was killed precisely because he got involved with Drugs.

So, two members of alphabet IRA involved in drug supply/distribution. Considering the fact that a small number of people in *any* drug distribution operation are caught, I would say there has been much more activity than what has been caught. Thanks for backing that up. I don't care if they're in their 90s. There is nothing ridiculous to suggest that as an organisation, the IRA raised money through drug supply. The important bit is *what* drugs - we know they are involved in cigarette smuggling, there is no reason they would not be involved in sticking kilos of hash, the popular form of cannabis in the 90s, into a car petrol tank and driving it around. You blame loyalists, but I'd love to know how loyalists managed to get it into places like Poleglass. They probably did somehow, and not without the knowledge, consent and help of IRA members. Hoods punished for drug dealing were not paying their dues.

&gt; Your suggestion that the British security services would turn a blind eye to an International drug ring run by the IRA is downright delusional, to have such an ace in their deck and not use shows a naivete on your part. 

Delusional my arse. Like I've already said, proving drug supply is very different to finding people for murder and paramilitary activity as are the criminal sanctions. There is simply little point in jailing someone for drug supply for a few months/years when you want them in for a very long time for paramilitary activities which carried much heavier sentences. Drug supply in NI was not a priority for MI5/6, and we already know other intelligence agencies such as the CIA were actively involved in smuggling when it suited their political aims. Why are you assuming that MI5/6 are not as unethical?

I find it disturbing that you think the IRA were not involved in drug supply because its simply difficult to prove - I am not a cop nor am I a prosecutor, and I assume you aren't either. Calm yourself for fuck sake.

I can explain this based on every perspective and consideration possible from construction engineering to environmental movements. The explanation ends in ""don't do it"". (Studied Engineering Economics in college and just came off a semester of graduate school for Environmental Project Management...)

Solely considering the nature of solar panels and day to day economics: 80% of Solar power is generated from 12:30pm to 2pm and Anfield tends to only turn on those big, energy expensive, lights much later in the evening.

Therefore, generated solar power would be sent back to the grid. The way this tends to work economically is that the power company will buy that energy from Anfield that the solar panels generate during the day and then sell Anfield traditionally generated energy later in the evening. The only way for this to be worth it economically is if there is a subsidy. Without this subsidy the solar panels fall apart before they pay for themselves.

subsidy example: In NYS the grid must pay 120% of the price of energy for solar energy sold back to the grid. So there is a possible 20% benefit for Anfield (which now hypothetically exists in my home state, ugh I wish) and a 20% dis-benefit for all other members of the grid.",null,0,null,1422389474,null,0,false,0,co2p4pu,null,t3_2tuog9,null,t1_co2p4pu,null,t3_2tuog9,null,null,null,1424358828,null,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null

I'll check out Udacity and Coursera as well.

I literally have no life goals. There are a few places I'd like to visit at some point (NZ, NYC, the Pacific Northwest) but to be honest if I knew I was going to die tomorrow I'd be pretty relieved. Everything in life seems to stress me out and all the crap seems to outweigh anything good in life.

I do feel pretty burned out as well. I started my postdoc while finishing my thesis, so I didn't really get a break. It's tempting to take some time out after my contract ends. 

Thanks for your advice, it's nice to know I'm not the only one feeling like this.

Everywhere else they are fairly reasonable - I disagree with a moratorium on GM crops but at least they haven't banned them completely.

I think their autarkic economic views have some merit to protect us from environmental catastrophes and price manipulation but we can't possibly hope to do it without using all of our possible resources and that might not need to include fracking, but it will need nuclear and it will need GM.

You should be aware that the newspapers are grossly misrepresenting many of their policies.

null,false,iheke,null,null,null,"Tottenham are 7th in total passes (10,518) or 478 per game.

13.47% backwards passes = 1,417 Total or 60 per game

For comparative purposes Man City rank 1st in total passes 12,753 total or 580 per game.

14.15% backwards passes = 1,805 Total or 82 per game

Quickly two more comparators:

Sunderland 14th (8,331 tot / 379 per game) - 16.85% backward pass = 1,404 tot or 63 per game

Chelsea 3rd (11,630 tot / 529 per game) - 16.32% backward pass = 1,898 tot or 86 per game.

I think a few people are struggling to read the chart and understand what its saying, what it can say, and what it all means. (I'd also say the graph isn't misleading - I was also like to speak up for the statto crowd who use data to inform what we're seeing - rather than just staring at the numbers religiously).

I think the conclusions we can draw are these (forgive me for the Hearthstone analogies that follow).

1. Tottenham are the most direct possession team in the league. We are for want of a better expression an ""Aggro team"". It's all about field control and getting those quick attacks in. Unsurprisingly our data is beginning to look very similar to another team on the south coast.

2. Man City (and our noisy neighbours) are what I would call ""control/aggro teams"" - passes exceed ours by a long way - 2,000+ from City and nearly 1,000 from that lot - they can either control/manage games or handout beatdowns like we can.

3. Chelsea are a control team (seemingly this is what LVG wants to do to Man Utd too). This team does not issue beat downs - unless the red carpet is rolled out a la Swansea - they score and then manage you out of the game or in big games they manage all proceedings controlling the pitch until one of their legendaries (see di maria / Rooney / RVP or Hazard / Fabregas / Costa) can deal the telling blow. Buying time is the main part of the game for these teams while they wait for the big guns to serve you up.

I think the chart shows these differences in philosophy beautifully. Man City and Chelsea are pretty close on passes and possession but worlds apart in approach and that is shown in that 2.17% diff in passes backwards. While Man city prefer to go forward and probe/attack - chelsea prefer to play safe and control.

A quick note on Sunderland. That number may look benign but for the fact that they average 46% possession per game. They rank 18th (equal with the goal starved Villa) on chance creation and 19th on goals scored (again only Villa below). That near 17% pass backwards shows me a team not doing much with the little ball that they do see. Which is why if I were a betting man - that backwards pass number might play a factor in me thinking that they were ripe for relegation - especially as QPR and Burnley have better pass backwards numbers, possession numbers and chance creation numbers. If we assumed all defences were equal (in terms of hopelessness) the data shows that two teams has the tools to score more than Sunderland.",null,0,null,1422389884,null,0,false,0,co2pejp,null,t3_2tuvp3,null,t1_co2pejp,null,t1_co2mntk,null,null,null,1424358699,null,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2,null

The Vow doesn't make any explicit promises about the continuation of Barnett. The full text is:

&gt; The people of Scotland want to know that all three main parties will deliver change for Scotland. We are agreed that:
&gt;
&gt;The Scottish Parliament is permanent and extensive new powers for the Parliament will be delivered by the process and to the timetable agreed and announced by our three parties, starting on 19th September.
&gt;
&gt;And it is our hope that the people of Scotland will be engaged directly as each party works to improve the way we are governed in the UK in the years ahead.
&gt;
&gt;We agree that the UK exists to ensure opportunity and security for all by sharing our resources equitably across all four nations to secure the defence, prosperity and welfare of every citizen.
&gt;
&gt;And because of the continuation of the Barnett allocation for resources, and the powers of the Scottish Parliament to raise revenue, we can state categorically that the final say on how much is spent on the NHS will be a matter for the Scottish Parliament.
&gt;
&gt;We believe that the arguments that so powerfully make the case for staying together in the UK should underpin our future as a country. We will honour those principles and values not only before the referendum but after.
&gt;
&gt;People want to see change. A No vote will deliver faster, safer and better change than separation.

Saying that something which would require legislation to change will, in the absence of any such legislation, continue to exist is not really saying anything at all.

Amazon and the like don't pay taxes and are essentially parasitical, plus treat their workers like shit. So whilst I take your point, that the economic recovery is destroying the high-street due to those that are driving it, its pretty much a moot point.

&gt; so I'd expect some of those shops will eventually become housing, rather than reopening when things get better.

Someone who is suicidally depressed had a greater chance of dying from typhoid fever a hundred years ago than they did today. So the suicide rate would have been naturally lowered by other, more immediate causes of death. Like war, or disease. Or hunger.

Death rates from all these things have drastically reduced in the last century. Suicide rates have gone up not because of a lack of diagnosis, or some drop in the standard of medical care. Or even a more depressing world. But because people are living longer than they used to, increasing the chances they'll die from suicide.

The countries with the highest rates of suicide are, by and large, developed nations with good healthcare, peaceful surroundings and access to mental heath treatment.

Or to put it another way: someone born in Sudan has a greater chance of being shot by someone else's weapon than shooting themselves. Because it is embroiled in war. People with mental health problems that - with no external problems - would eventually lead them to suicide, they can still die from other causes long before they turn the gun on themselves.

This isn't a waiting list for treatment; it's a waiting list for diagnosis to see if treatment is required. 

So, why is the waiting list so long? Because of greater awareness of the condition but no further funding being received by clinics. A issue that plagues a lot of treatment that falls under mental health.

In the meantime, I can opt to go private (paying out of pocket, of course), but that can affect my treatment through the NHS in the future, so I'm loathed to do that.

That is where I would start to disagree. Or at least, I would state that if we are giving banks billions of pounds we should at least own the fucking things. And in the case of the one we *did* own, it was sold at a loss.

But aside from that, yeah things still look bleak. Things will continue looking bleak. The future is bleak.

If I was a gambling man I would put money on this recovery stopping. Or, alternatively, this recovery disproportionately affecting the richest in society (Who, let me remind you, got richer during the recession, not poorer).

- If Chelsea is such a defensive/controlling team, how do they score so many goals? Why do they have more shots on goal than all other teams?

- We do not have a low passing number because we are ""aggro"". Our numbers are so low because teams like Palace, Burnley, and even Leicester are able to control game play against us.

- I am not anti-Poch. I think we've improved a lot this season. But to deduce from these numbers that we are ""aggro"" and more offensive minded than the other teams is not accurate.

- Lastly, you didn't think Sunderland were ripe for relegation before you stumbled across these numbers? You know what might tell you a team is ripe for relegation? That they have scored the least goals of all teams in the league.

null,false,BareRuinedChoirs,null,null,null,"Most jobs outside academia involve using the telephone routinely. You will be seriously disadvantage if you can't use it -- emails take ten times longer and are easy to ignore, and not having something on the written record is often greatly advantageous. As someone with a history PhD now working outside academia, this was also one of the main things that I was nervous about and found a major culture shock. But it's something I eventually got used to, and now value very much.

So... suggest you volunteer to fill in vital omissions in your skillset like this, or at least get enough work experience to offset the quite justifiable (and in your case, entirely valid) concerns of many employers about the capabilities of PhD grad. It's also worth thinking about how you will counter these assumptions at interview, i.e. consider dressing smartly and being friendly and approachable. 

I know you don't have any specific ambitions, but it would be very much worthwhile looking at person specifications of jobs that you might enjoy doing, to identify the kinds of qualities that employers are looking for. 

The university at which you did your PhD might be able to provide careers advice, as this is probably a very common question. My understanding is that the league tables monitor career progress over the medium term, so your uni will still be willing to provide advice even if you've graduated. 

Also, your current uni might have some sort of 'researcher development officer' -- I know mine did, whose advice was quite helpful to me while I was doing a short post-doc before jumping ship.
