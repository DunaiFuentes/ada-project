null,false,Rosti_LFC,lfc93,,null,"To be honest, having been made part of admin staff in communities where I was a regular, it's not always the best for regulars to be made moderators. 

On one hand sure, they've demonstrated that they're online a lot, but plenty of people are online a lot without visibly commenting on everything. And it can be quite awkward sometimes having arguments with people on topics where you're just trying to be another community user who happens to be staff, because the fact that you *are* staff can sometimes cloud that.

On Reddit it's maybe not so bad because you can turn when to appear as a moderator on and off, but at the same time it's worse because you can be upvoted/downvoted because your position potentially gives you an authority in discussions that you don't really have any call to be an authority on (or the opposite, if the staff aren't flavour of the month at the time). That said most Reddit moderating seems to be fairly clear-cut on communities that are well-behaved like this one. 

tl;dr being a moderator can sometimes make it harder to be a regular joe, which is bad for people who enjoy being a regular joe and post a lot as a result.

That's true,  they burn any money they receive as KLF type 'installation Art'.  :D

Or they deliberately scam the Tax authorities through fiendishly arcane tax arrangements.  One of their more straightforward   methods is their 'continual international investment' strategy where the profits that should be taxable in the UK are 'siphoned off' because they are building more warehouses in India or where-ever. 

They and others  are operating at an unfair advantage to UK based and taxed firms. It's my contention that firms like them and Google, Starbucks etc., should be punitively taxed on **turn-over** to overcome their avoidance/evasion/scamming. Who knows, in that case, they might find it more profitable to start filing 'honest' tax returns.

Another false premise.

Muslims are not under constant attack. Mosques are not being routinely attacked across the country. That is patently untrue.

What there has been however is attacks against Mosques after major terrorist attacks, for example the beheading of Lee Rigby.

This is reprehensible of course, and everyone condemns it. Anyone caught committing such a crime is given a sturdy jail sentence, and rightly so.

But those isolated attacks don't represent the epidemic that you're suggesting.

Islam is often demonised in the tabloids, that much is obvious. I don't dispute that.

My point was that Muslims as a group are not persecuted, nor are they oppressed. Either socially or politically, or economically.

That in fact is a narrative that the Islamists propagate to serve their cause, you shouldn't be giving it credence.

[The link I posted above says:](https://michaelsherlockauthor.wordpress.com/2015/04/01/isis-is-islam/)

&gt;There are clear contradictions between the noble and peaceful verses in the Qur’an and their more violent and dangerous counterparts.  On the one hand, the Qur’an advocates tolerance and on the other, in exactly the same circumstances, it encourages violence.  So how does one go about reconciling these contradictions?  More importantly, for the correct application of scripture, how have the majority of Muslim scholars, for the majority of the history of Islam, gone about reconciling these contradictions?

&gt;To answer these questions we must first acquire some historical context.  The alleged revelations compiled in the Qur’an are divided into two primary categories – Meccan and Medinan.  They are divided in this way because Muhammad allegedly received his first revelations in Mecca, in somewhat peaceful circumstances, and he later received revelations in Medina, in the midst of war. [19] Naturally, the more peaceful chapters and verses generally fall under the Meccan category, while the violent ones belong to the later Medinan class. [20]

I don't know exactly how Superdrug do their in-house testing before deciding to put a product forward for SPF testing and then taking to market, but they may well be smoothing and leaving as I said, because that is how the product is tested.

Different chemical filters have different properties, some are UVB only, some are broad spectrum, some STINK, some are oily, some go on white initially. You can compare the ingredients to that product to the Simple sunscreen/ moisturisers I have used that both started out white - full ingredients are on the mega review.

http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionUK/comments/2zt2x7/the_sunscreen_reviews/

Obviously if the product is still white after leaving to settle in for a while, then return it to Superdrug. It is a marketed as an everyday cosmetic type sunscreen not a beach or sport product so absolutely should give a cosmetically acceptable result. If you have to use less than the recommended half teaspoon to get a non-white effect then the product is arguably not fit for purpose. I have returned an own brand to Superdrug before, no problem even without a receipt.

Either way, yes I do think 30k is low for where he's at now and where he was at last season. But the way the checkpoints in his development and contract have lined up has been kind of unfortunate for us. The start of last season he actually wasn't very good at all (if I wasn't lazy I would pull up all the discussion post-Hull defeat... it wasn't pretty). 30k was about right for a prospect of his caliber by my reckoning, if he had been on 60k before that it wouldn't have looked good, though I'll grant you that even if he had stalled at that stage indefinitely, 60k for a squad player for a few years wouldn't have been all that painful, probably. However, it would have greatly affected our negotiations with the likes of Can, Ibe, Moreno, Markovic, etc and our overall wage bill would be way higher right now based on the knock-on effects. Giving one 19 year-old 60k to warm the bench indefinitely is one thing, but doing that for every 19 year-old would be a dangerous precedent.

B) The Eurozone crisis made British government debt more attractive by comparison.

C) Quantitative easing lowered yields significantly.

He doesn't seem as technically gifted as a dribbler, but that's fine if you ask me. Sterling leans on his dribbling skill too much when he's otherwise not on form, and it leads to absurdly wasteful play and frustrating overall performances. From what little we've seen, Ibe seems like more of a fighter in defense, more physically powerful in all phases, and when he's in possession he just wants to attack the damn goal. 

Sterling seems prone to attacking the corner flag/endline and getting trapped by 3 defenders when he's having an off day, which has been a lot lately.

You're just asking anyone to accept that because of one Guardian article with information from one man. 

You're saying the only way to reduce the deficit is with the changes the Conservatives made.

You insulted academics - presumably just the economists - apparently because they don't all own coffee shops. 

Even the small pieces of information in your post are laced with ideological baggage. 

&gt;What it did ensure though was that borrowing costs for the government and for British businesses remained low. Of course the economists aren't going to tell you that though.

Should've just stopped at the first sentence. Why won't the economists tell us that? It's just sort of shoe-horned in without any explanation.

I'd be happy to buy a mini travel size something to try, because I need to know it works with the rest of my products. I'd even be happy to purchase one use sachets, like what Paula's Choice do with the skincare stuff, they're like 80p and you get maybe four-five uses out of them max, but it's enough to see if it unsuitable or not. 

In the case of cosmetics, tiny packets of foundations or those foil lifty uppy things that have powders or creams in, just enough to see if it works with your skin tone or not, or to see if it lasts all day or not. I know most places will pot up a foundation sample for free, which tends to be one of the hardest things to get right, so a sample is vital, you need to know it works for you and matches your skin tone, it's not the same having it swatched on your jawline over your current routine. The only problems comes when you don't have that brand available near you to get one, so selling small sachets online would be perfect. 

Like I've been after a NARS foundation sample for years, I posted in this sub about it a few month ago, I discovered that a NARS counter had finally opened near me and when I made a journey in, she wouldn't give me a tester pot of the foundation to try at home, she said I had to bring my own pot in (yeah I'll just use a giant Tupperware box for a blob of foundation). She swatched it on my jaw and it looked wayyy too light, but I think it would have looked okay with my powder and with a full face for a dramatic look, and I stated this, but she was massively unhelpful and now I think bollocks to them. If they're worried about loss and waste, I could have bought a tiny pot to take a sample away, I wouldn't have minded. 

So yeah, more samples, paid or free, but of more products in all shades so people can properly try the products and then there'll be less refunds or unhappy customers who have been mis-sold wrong shades.

**WARNING:** The Black Tea flavour has discrepancies, the US version is called ""Black Tea &amp; Blackberry"", EU version is called ""Black Tea"" they have different ingredients, see below for details.

**Price of product:** £7.25 for 7g

**Where did you purchase:** [Escentual.com](http://www.escentual.com/)

**Product claims:** *""Protect your lips from the elements with the Jack Black Intense Therapy Lip Balm SPF25 with Black Tea, a cult shea butter balm that immediately soothes your dry, chapped and irritated lips.*

*Created to rapidly penetrate your lips and provide instant relief, this hardworking daily conditioner restores lips to softness. The dynamic formula provides protection from windburn and temperature extremes, making it as perfect for the slopes and the beach as it is for life in the city.*

*Further protection is provided by a broad spectrum SPF of 25, paired with natural antioxidants vitamin E, black tea and green tea, which shield skin from the damage caused by UV-induced free radicals. Scented with the aromatic and fruity fragrance of Black Tea and Blackberry, the Intense Therapy Lip Balm is a great way to keep your lips in top condition.""*

**About you:** Compulsive lip biter/picker, frequently chapped lips from dehydration.

**Your opinion:** First off, something in this isn't agreeing with my lips and is causing them to peel but the multiple ingredients list iterations throw me off as ingredient concentration makes a difference in how long before irritation can occur. Second day of use and my lips have started peeling.

The fragrance in this is ***strong***, sniff it while it's still in the box and you can smell it, take it out and it starts wafting around, open it to use? You're gonna get looks from people wondering where the smell is coming from. It's not unpleasant to me though, actually does smell of berries and black tea leaves but the strength could be unsettling for some people.

The texture is very very thick inside the tube and takes more effort than my Elizabeth Arden Lip Balm to squeeze out, but will melt into a much more manageable state once it touches your skin. It's slightly thicker in texture than the Vaseline lip balms with an obvious occlusive texture but not sticky feeling.

If it didn't make my lips peel, this would be a pretty nice albeit heavily fragranced SPF lip balm with decent packaging (opaque tube means light is less likely to degrade the UV filters).

This is exactly why they find their identities, communities, and support networks in religious communities, ones that link them with the cultures and traditions of their parents, their grandparents, and more distant ancestors. This makes them easy prey for radicals, as we have no alternative to offer them.

I'm sympathetic to the fact that you can't always fulfill once elected the promises you make in opposition. However, there are a number of things that make his tuition fee pledge different;

* 1) It wasn't just a ""policy"", it was like a central pillar of lib dem theology. It would be like labour coming out and saying it wanted to ban unions. It was a **betrayal** of their core ideology. 

* 2) The Lib dems didn't just along with the conservatives on it... Vince Cable actually masterminded the increase. It was one of the most ill conceived and poorly implemented plans in the history of higher education. 

* 3) The end result is utterly regressive. It managed to get the worst of both worlds - the unaffordability (to the state) of a real graduate tax with the social immobility of an aggressive fees system (like in the US). We are now in a position where in the next decade we will be forced to revist university funding when it becomes clearer that repayments are drastically below the ambitious projections. 

The bottom line is this; As a voter in our democracy (and most Western democracies) the only mechanism you have to hold MP's to account is your vote. If you allow the Lib Dems to get away with their utter betrayal of voters then you are sending a message to all politicians that they can literally say anything, and renege on it later. Now the harsh truth is politicians will always play fast and lose with the truth... but they should at least have a vague ideaology they stick to. For the conservatives its free enterprise and they are generally true to it. For labour its the inherent fairness of society and the workplace.. and they do generally *try* to uphold it (with varying success). For the lib dems **it was** the value of social mobility and education. They sold it out for power. 

If you believe in our democracy then you owe it to everyone not to vote Nick Clegg - at least not on this occasion. It is the only way to send a message to politicians of all parties that they must at least make an effort to honour their principles.

He's also not going to be a physical threat. He's a very tidy player, who even at a young age looked incredibly comfortable on the ball. That's rare. But I think he's been somewhat overlooked because he's played in 442 systems where you need a box to box player and a more defensive player. He isn't either of those.

He isn't anywhere near as good as Modric, obviously, but if you were to compare him to anyone we've had recently it would be him. And if Luka has shown anything it's that assists and goals aren't always the most important stat for a cm. He's also shown how a player in small stature can do a decent job defensively. I'm beginning to doubt if he will ever 'break' through for us, but I'd love him to be a squad player for us.

null,false,potpan0,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country,null,"First of all I think it's a little disingenuous to suggest our current immigration system is discriminatory, or at least any more discriminatory than what UKIP are suggesting. By being members of the EU, we've agreed to join a system where a citizen from any EU member state can move to and work in any other EU member state. This isn't based on things like ethnicity, or birth country, rather it is based on civic nationality. For example, an Algerian immigrant to France, who has gained French citizenship, could move to and work in the UK under the same conditions as a French born French citizen. 

It's only discriminatory to the extent that any immigration policy based upon nationality is discriminatory, and seeing that UKIP are suggesting an even more stringent nationality based immigration policy than we currently hold as EU members, it comes across as hypocritical to call immigration policies within the EU discriminatory while supporting UKIP's immigration policies. 

By being members of the EU, we don't *have* to turn away immigrants from non-EU countries, that is the choice of our government to placate an anti-immigration sentiment among some voters. 

Secondly, UKIP have said, both in their provisional manifesto and in interviews, that they support discriminating against non-British workers in employment. They actually used the work 'discriminate' in their provisional manifesto. Currently, I believe, a business cannot base their selection of an employee on a protected characteristic, like sex, or ethnicity, or nationality. One of the reasons why Farage said he wanted to scrap racial discrimination laws is because they prevented discrimination in employment based upon nationality. 

While UKIP have been unsurprisingly vague about this policy, it suggests they support actual discrimination against workers who were not born in Britain, despite (assumably) them holding British citizenship or other rights to live and work in Britain. Do they support employers being able to sack a worker for no other reason than their nationality? If someone has duel nationality, will they count as non-British? Questions like these have been left unanswered, which makes many people worry about the intentions of UKIP.

&gt;I posted another 3 links below all of them articulate that business wants the deficit tackled

I'm a little confused by it all really. It seems the main swing of all of this is - to reduce the deficit you either tax the rich more or reduce public spending. The main argument for not taxing the rich is because it would stunt economic growth. But growth has been bad. Seems we killed all those disabled people for nothing.

See that last sentence? That's a shit thing for me to say. I could argue all day about how accurate it is but it's just not helpful and I'm doing it to push buttons. I probably haven't made this point as well as I hoped.

&gt;Regarding the economists I was referring to the fact that they have no real experience of managing anything.

I find that stance a little anti-academic. It's a strange idea to me that we should be listening more to the less reflective and practical side of learning rather than the people outside the current system studying it. But that might be because I'm more progressive and want to see some change.

On the other hand I am pretty quick to call on the media for their terrible representation of the working class in Britain.

There's definitely a balance. I really think travellers should start examining their own culture. I've heard all the arguments about how our society is unfit for them and this makes them outcasts. They're not wrong really.

I really am not sure what she means by this. How are maths, english and science irrelevant to traveller culture?

    Dzeko: 422
    Aguero: 1125
    Bony: 337
    Jovetic: 223

Goals scored by each in this calendar year (not counting the friendly in which Dzeko and Jovetic scored, also counting penalties which Aguero gets to take / less opportunity for Dzeko to score from):

    Dzeko: 2
    Aguero : 4
    Bony: 1
    Jovetic: 1

Minutes per goal:

    Dzeko: 211
    Aguero: 281
    Bony: 337
    Jovetic: 223

So why the hell are you shitting on Dzeko, who has the best minutes per goal?

Also for the record, would like nothing more than for Dzeko to move to a club where he can be a 1st choice as his potential is wasted at City. So I agree he should be sold in summer.

p.s. he just scored a hattrick in Euro qualifiers over the weekend and looks to be hitting form.

Instead he will have to lower his price, meaning he can sell the same quantity as before, but make less money. That's dammed annoying. It's like taking a pay cut for no fault of your own. 

Why will he sell none at the usual price? Because folk will choose to buy from US sellers at the usual US price. 

In a less than perfectly competitive market, sales will diminish in quantity, or prices will fall, both of which hurt profits. 

PS. Even if he holds the international monopoly on this product, profits will still fall, because the profit-maximising price will fall.

null,false,juzashannon,lfc12,,null,"I'm a 16 year old Scouser who was born into a family of reds with one or two acceptations and living only a mile away from Anfield, so it seemed obvious for me to support the reds.

As I'm a 16 year old, my first season I can properly remember watching the reds whenever I could (probably did before hand but just didn't remember) was 2004/05. The obvious thing I could say would be Gerrard vs Olympiakos or Istanbul to be the stand out moment which took me in for life but it actually wasn't.

It was a cold November afternoon at Anfield where Liverpool are on as the 4pm kick off on a Sunday and Rafa's boys where coming up against the team dubbed as ""The Invincibles"" the previous season having not lost a game for the entire season and were still doing quite well in this having only lost 1 league game in their last 54 league games (and that was at Old Trafford). They strolled up to Anfield with world class names such as Henry, Vieira, Pires. And a defence which could realistically on their day stop any strike force in the world - Lehmann, Lauren, Toure, Campbell, Cole. - And the two we're putting them up against? Florence Sinama-Pongolle and Neil Mellor...

I'll be full honest, I don't remember much of the game, I remember how both Alonso's and Vieira's goals where fantastically worked goals with finishes to match but they aren't the moment I'm meaning.

91:30 - Chris Kirkland (yep, Chris Kirkland) was setting up a free kick to take just outside of his box, all expecting Liverpool to try and keep this sort of result by just making sure the ball stays with us. Of course we want the win but a hard work draw vs the champions isn't a bad result. Some would consider not getting 3 points from this being harsh. But a draw would be a fair result.

91:46 - Chris Kirkland has just booted it up field, getting it up field and hoping Arsenal don't format some sort of counter attack. The ball just bounces over the head of Patrick Vieira and Harry Kewell tries to win the ball and is taken out by Sol Campbell. But in doing so has brought a certain Mr. Kolo Toure out of position.

91:50 - In the dying embers of the game, the ball having bounced of off Campbell's back has landed right into the path of the Liverpool youth prospect named Neil Mellor. And with a strike which I have no doubt in my mind he said ""Fuck it, why not?"" And goes and strikes the ball right past the bottom corner of the Kop net past Lehmann to win the game for the mighty reds.

91:52 - Pure elation, Liverpool have done it, Liverpool have won right at the depth, against the champions, the invincible champions. Thanks to a young lad from Sheffield who came from our academy.

This is the moment which has stuck in my head ever since I was a young 6 year old, of the moment I knew for certain in my head... These boys in red are something special.

 I would say that since it's where the skin has been damaged it could just be an issue with sensitivity and that area of skin could just dislike a product you use, maybe eliminate one product from your routine at a time and see if it helps to clear up. 

A main thing that helped me is washing my makeup brushes more often, I had bad acne around my cheek/cheekbone area which cleared up significantly as soon as I started washing my blush brush more regularly! 

In the mean time the ""origins super spot remover"" has helped clear up some of my breakouts, even though it stings like hell. 

And finally, you could always try swapping your physical charcoal scrub for a chemical exfoliator as it has the same effect but is much less damaging to the skin and doesn't cause the skin to produce as much oil (which can block pores and lead to spots).

Holding a scholarship means you will automatically meet the financial criteria. It's the college that handles that though so you'll have to wait until you get assigned a college. 

I'm afraid I don't know about the visa, but if there's any doubt just contact the department's graduate administrator/graduate studies officer/equivalent -- they deal with queries like these all the time and should be able to help you.

A) he copied one section of the massive entry

B) He copied from a wikipedia article. Articles which are notoriously easy to edit. even if someone has got a background in the subject edits it, how do you or I know how contextualised their findings of that book are? 


In other words, are they doing the equivalent of reading the blurb, or another person's review of the book and submitting those two lines as a representation of the whole book or did they actually read what I'm assuming the author themselves published as fully countered findings and contextualised arguments.

To put it in visible terms, the articles introduction, devotes a substantial paragraph and several sources that say perhaps it still has a military connotation (Several quoted books are outdated as was the one from the 70's) and a few lines on the greater Muslim public view of it being an inner struggle.

If we did conduct a scholarly search, would we find equivalent findings for both camps? It is undeniable that Jihad has always been used in many aspects of Islamic struggle, in early Islam with the intention of conquest. It has similarly always had the deeper meaning struggle with oneself. every book ever compiled will frame every argument on the etymolgy and the current Islamic/non-Islamic usage of the word Jihad. and that is vital when you're talking about phrases that hold so much power and weight that they can incite violence through misunderstanding.

I hope it's clear that my issue with using wikipedia as a source is that this information is circumstantial at best and unreliable at worst. Go to the homepages of the various Islamic UK councils, listen to Islamic scholars speak, even read books by academics on the subject.

null,false,FezojT,null,null,null,"I think there is a clear difference between voting to let a motion pass and abstention though. A lot of students voted Lib Dem *because* of their tuition fee promises, so it was a pretty hard kick in the teeth to them when the tuition fee vote happened. 

MPs are elected on the basis of their character (individually) and on the policies their party plan to implement over the parliamentary term. Granted, a party manifesto is not a contract, there are no legal obligations to fulfil, but it still serves as the basis on which a lot of MPs get voted into power. You have to ask yourself, what is the point of a representative democracy if your representatives are elected on false premises? The words from the Lib Dem manifesto were ""we will scrap unfair university tuition fees"", not ""we will scrap unfair university tuition fees, unless we get into a coalition, in which case we will do the exact opposite"". It was in their voters' interests that tuition fees were scrapped. If they were unable to scrap them as part of a coalition deal to implement other policies, they should have abstained, because the status quo was more in their voters' interests than a rise. 

Perhaps it would be forgiveable if the Lib Dems had got some good concessions for the tuition fee fiasco, but I'm unconvinced they really achieved anything substantial that wasn't already in line with the Conservative ideology of fewer/lower taxes. The AV referendum was a poor thing to sell the party for because 1) nobody wanted it, not even the Lib Dems and 2) the Conservatives (and some of Labour) went full steam ahead with their fear and disinformation campaign anyway; they didn't have a chance of electoral reform.

I can't say I feel particularly sorry for the Lib Dems or Mr. Clegg. I understand the rationalisation behind their decisions and I fundamentally disagree with it. So do most of their previous supporters apparently, and I can't say they deserve anything less. I'm currently leaning towards voting Lib Dem this time around, but I have to ask myself, why would I do that? I agree with what they say, but if there is no guarantee they'll try to implement their promises, perhaps the Monster Raving Loony Party would would be a better choice so I could properly register my dissatisfaction with the list of candidates available.

At some point it does, but that wasn't the point. In 2010, the UK had a debt/GDP ratio lower than Germany and France; we were also paying historically low interest on our debt. There was no risk for the fiscal solidity of the UK that necessitated austerity; but there were very compelling reasons not to enact austerity, due to the severe economic crisis ongoing at the time. On the balance of things, we should have borrowed at low rates back then to prop up the economy, and tighetened up and paid down that (low-interest) debt later during times of prosperity.

Landlords will not stay with an agent that doesn't bring them in tenants. 

Landlords are not the enemy, they are in the vast majority of cases people who have worked hard and invested their fruits into a property for a lifelong return. Landlords require a representative to protect them from the unscrupulous tenants and for that; CJ Hole exist. You may not agree with the tactics of CJ Hole but they're there to server landlords, not us the tenants. All landlords want more rent, an interest rate rise is on the horizon and the running of a property can be expensive so having the money to buffer any increases helps justify the investment. 

Turning to 'Popular opinion' style policies of Rent Control and the banning of business promotion results in a poorer environment for us all to live in, landlords are not evil people and will want to ensure you're a happy tenant who stays forever. If you introduce rent controls the margin they generate can reduce and even disappear in the case of a BoE base rate rises - as tenants, this is very, very bad. 

If you can't afford these fees then don't rent through CJ Hole, simple. If this trend continues then CJ Hole will become uncompetitive and have to resort to lower fees thus the equilibrium of the market returns.

Considering its a highly affluent constituency that's never returned a Labour MP I'd be shocked if it happened.  Prior to the Lib Dems triumph in 1997 the constituency was a *very* safe conservative seat with *every* election from the constituency returning a conservative MP since its creation in the late 1800's.  You only have to look at the [Wikipedia entry on Hallam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield_Hallam_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29) to get a clear picture on what sort of constituency it is.

&gt;On income-based 2004 statistics this is the most affluent constituency one place below the top ten seats of the 650, which were spread across the South-East of England (including London), with almost 12% of residents earning over £60,000 a year. This measure placed Sheffield Hallam above Windsor and Twickenham.

&gt;Based on 2011-12 income and tax statistics from HMRC, Sheffield Hallam has the 70th highest median income of the 650 parliamentary constituencies, with those above it almost exclusively in London and the south-east, and notably placing it ahead of Tunbridge Wells (76th), The Cotswolds (92nd), Cambridge (97th), Hemel Hempstead (103rd), and David Cameron's Witney constituency (121st).

&gt;The 2001 Census showed Hallam to have the highest number of people classified as professionals of any of the UK constituencies. Furthermore, 60% of working age residents hold a degree, 7th highest and exceeding Cambridge.

You are right that Core 1 isn't representative, especially of the further maths modules, since it basically just rehashes GCSE and extends it a bit. Take a look at FP1 and that will give you a better idea of how long the harder modules will take you. 

Depending on your base level of maths (why are you doing this? I assume you aren't a normal alevel student by the description) and how much of a natural you are there are some reasonably difficult concepts in M2 and the FP modules, have you studied physics? That will help with mechanics. So it isn't just a case of reading the book and doing practice questions, it may take some time to get your head around it. I went on to do physics at uni and struggled at times with various bits in FP2.

If it was me I'd maybe try to do Core 1/2, M1, D1 and S1 (maybe fp1) in the next sitting, it won't be the time to study that will be the problem so much as if you can hold all the different topics in your head at the same time since the exams will be fairly close together.",null,0,null,1427925954,null,0,false,0,cpy9l6i,null,t3_3143yg,null,t1_cpy9l6i,null,t3_3143yg,null,null,null,1432143841,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

&gt; Is there any hope that I can find a place that heats up okay without breaking the bank?

A home with central heating in and a reasonable standard of insulation and double glazing should cost no more than around £1200 a year to heat and light to a comfortable level for you.

&gt; Are produce and meat very expensive? How much does one typically spend on food to cook at home? I really enjoy cooking, but I need to know if I should prepare for high-price food.

A single person should be able to feed themselves very well for £20-£30 a week. If you are happy to cook your own stuff from fresh it works out towards the cheaper end of the scale. We only spend £80 a week for a family of four. [This is what my local butcher does for £20](http://i.imgur.com/k2OmGQF.jpg). There's enough meat there to last a single person more than two weeks.

&gt; Cell/mobile phones: can I get a cheap data plan on a phone there? I know my phone company doesn't offer service abroad, but I'm hoping I can still get an internet-enabled phone for decent price. Is there a particular company that would be good for that?

Three. All you can eat data and calls is £27 a month sim only.

&gt; I've heard, many times, that a motor vehicle is not necessary in the UK, but Kent looks rural on GoogleMaps. Is it still true that I don't need a car?

Oh man, 18C here is definitely considered a warm day.  Just get a fan heater and use it in the room you're in and it won't be too bad.  A lot of our homes are well insulated, but if the landlord is cheap (and they often are) it won't be.  Check the energy efficiency renting advertised with the property.

Data is cheap, e.g. Three (three.co.uk) does unlimited 4G data, and a bunch of minutes and texts for around £15/mo.  You can use 25GB of your unlimited data when travelling in the US too (+ 15 other countries or so).

Food isn't too pricey, 500g of chicken breast is £3.30 from Sainsburys.  £40/week will cover you just fine.

People often spend a significant proportion of their income on rent due to high rents.  I pay about 30%.

Cars vary depending where you live, if you're in a city you probably don't need one, otherwise it depends.  You will only be able to drive for 12 months without getting a UK license (via a test that is relatively challenging)

Yes libraries are the same here.

Socialism is the ideology of someone who believes that the workers/state should own most of or all the means of production, income and wealth redistribution should be very high, with high taxes and benefits, and low income inequality. 

EU federalism is the belief that the EU should continue to integrate further (including the UK joining for those who are pro-EU over here). More and more powers given to the EU over sovereign parliaments until eventually every member state is just that - a state of the United States of Europe, in similar style to the USA. One massive nation, one fiscal policy &amp; currency &amp; central bank, one defence policy &amp; military force etc. with only local issues devolved to state parliaments. 

Thus a socialist EU federalist would believe that the UK should join the EU and encourage further integration until it is effectively a USE. Once that is accomplished they would push for much higher taxes, more effective wealth redistribution and renationalisation of industries throughout the EU.

There are usually flat/house shares on Rightmove. 

If you end up needing a car I'm not sure your US licence will entitle you to drive here - perhaps someone else can chime in here with more information. 

If you consider 18°C cold then you're in for a shock until summer arrives. Summer is between 20 and 28 here and lasts around eight weeks. Right now temperatures are between 4 and 12 but mostly below 10.

Food is generally inexpensive as staple foods aren't subject to sales tax (VAT) but that tax is 20% when it is applied so you might find that food to which it does apply is expensive compared to what you're used to. 

Mobile phone providers are competitive here, so you have the freedom to shop around for exactly what you're looking for. Have a look at the cheapest options that give you your expected amount of data required. Look at Vodafone, EE, O2, Three, and Giffgaff (I think that's the one I'm thinking of).

Renting sight unseen isn't the best idea. If you know someone nearby already, see if they'll view the property for you first. If not, perhaps it is an idea to stay somewhere else for a week or two so you can view potential properties first hand.

RE dress sense, most places I know aren't picky about jeans but some pubs and bars won't like hoodies and work boots/clothes. You probably won't have a problem. You won't be expected to wear dresses and whatnot. You certainly wouldn't be up here, that's for sure, and I can't imagine that being different in Kent. Most people will overlook anything if you can make a good cup of tea, in which case the order of operations is: cup + teabag + boiling water + 3 minutes - bag (no squeezing) + milk.

null,false,Taure,null,null,null,"A) There is no *automatic* connection between printing of money and currency devaluation. There's a whole host of factors that are at play in a currency's value. Printing of money often devalues currency because it generally leads to inflation, which generally lowers the value of the currency (same amount of money in nominal terms buys less stuff domestically, savings in the currency lose real value faster). 

However, there are many ways in which these ""generally"" statements can be disrupted. The market for currencies is global. The value of the pound didn't fall during quantitative easing, which is printing of money by another name. Why? For a variety of reasons, but mainly because the pound was still considered valuable relative to the Euro, but also because the specific manner in which money was printed limited its inflationary effect; the fact that printing of money took place during a time of low liquidity helped (said printing increased liquidity, and so returned the market to its normal state).

B) You rather missed the point about not using the power. Markets are about expectations: if the market expects that if A, then B, then this expectation will be incorporated into the price without it ever having to actually happen. The *possibility* of the Bank of England printing money to finance government debt is all that is necessary to keep the yields on government debt low, the BoE doesn't have to actually do it. So long as the BoE *can* do it, investors factor in the fact that they know with 100% certainty that they'll get paid. British government debt is therefore very attractive to investors, so demand is high, and yields stay low. 

Subject, of course, to the fact that, like currencies, there's an international market in government bonds and yields will be affected by what is on offer elesewhere.

As long as we are not playing CL every year and fightig for titles we either overpay for players or we keep missing out on the top players because they can easily choose a better team that offers as much or more as us. People here need to realise that players usually choose their team based on wages and title potential, its not like there is loads and loads of young talented Liverpool fans just waiting to sign a contract with us for next to nothing. 

We are not a top team at the moment, and if we want to become one any time soon we need the top players to come in and compliment our already talented and young team that is clearly not ready to fight for PL titles yet. This probably means paying a little more than players are worth. Any team that has bought their way to the top has done it at the begining. We are no different, money rules unfortunatly and we can invest in youth as much as we want, it doesnt help when we sell them when they start to play top football.

null,false,lilacmonkey12,null,null,null,"I live in Kent and Kent varies a lot with Rent etc. Do you know which town/city you will be living in? Or where you'll work so I can suggest a place to live? Then you want to search for a good landlord/letting agency, some are so terrible so it's best to have a recommendation or find somewhere with lots of good reviews on google.  
  
Most landlords don't allow pets especially dogs, bad owners can mean a messed up house or complaints from neighbours, some people have them anyway and hope the landlord doesn't find out but then they're breaking their contract so I don't reccomend that. You can ask them would you allow my dog, it's a good breed, house trained, not a puppy etc. it doesn't hurt to ask but depends on the landlord.  
You should see the house/flat before you rent, you could end up with a shit hole which looked nice in pictures and then you'll be stuck with it 6months/year or however long you stay for.  
It's probably best to find somewhere temporary that you can leave once you get a permanent place sorted. If the flat/house is available straight away then you can move in as soon as contract/deposit/guarantor is in order which can be quite quick but not always. Usually landlords will start advertising the flat/house as soon as the tenants say when they're moving out so they can have a new person renting straight after the old has left.  
West Kent prices are very different to East Kent, the closer to London the more expensive so the percentage of income used on rent depends on your income and where you live.  
Sorry but in England 18C is fairly warm, a very hot day would be around 25C and that doesn't happen that often (maybe a week or 2 in summer). Flats tend to stay warmer than houses especially if the flats around yours have heating on a lot so heating is cheaper. Electric heating is more expensive, it's best to have a place with radiators where the hot water runs through because that's cheaper (I think).   
I live by myself and spend £20-£30 a week, it does depend on how much chocolate and crap you buy. The supermarket Aldi is cheap for meat/veg and most things, Tesco/Asda cost more. Usually Green Grocers and Butchers are the cheapest places if you can find a decent local one.  
For Phones, check the coverage for where you live, sometimes the coverage for one provider is better than another. Pretty much every company does a good deal so find the phone you want and see who offers it the cheapest and then look at their plans. I'm personally on GiffGaff which I find cheap for my low usuage which uses O2 signal and O2 locked phones work with it.   
Again the car thing depends where you live. If you're in towns/cities you don't need one but if you're going to live in a village or some of the small towns then you probably will. Cars are expensive here for everything, insurance is expensive, petrol is expensive, if it's a cheap car then something could go wrong then that's expensive.  
Yes you can. Kent libraries are pretty good and you can do all that.  
Basically with clothing, don't wear loose jeans and old baggy tops and old white trainers and look scruffy when you're meeting new people because that's not a great impression. What normal people on american tv wear is fine so jeans, nice top etc. Just don't look scruffy when meeting people. You don't have to wear a skirt/dress, only if you want to. I wear blue/othercolours jeans for everyday wear. You'll see when you get here what everyone wears, just try to observe and then if neccessary go on an emergency trip to primark (or somewhere more expensive idk how much money you'll have)

Take at least one day a week off to do things that require minimal thought and another half-day to do necessary non-study things that require thought. It will help to stave off mental exhaustion and keep up with housework.

Sometimes you may get stuck on a concept. If this happens, leave it for a bit. If you're already frustrated at this point, take a longer than usual break and do something relaxing. If not, study something else for a bit.

Decision is the most fun, so I'd probably spread it throughout the year. Your mileage may vary.

Yes there is? Japan specifically does it all the time to keep their currency weak and until recently so did Switzerland.

&gt;Printing of money often devalues currency because it generally leads to inflation

No printing more of something leads to its value lessening because..... There's more of it....

&gt;the specific manner in which money was printed limited its inflationary effect;

No it didn't. We did exactly the same as what a number of other countries did and our currency depreciated.

&gt;Markets are about expectations: if the market expects that if A, then B, then this expectation will be incorporated into the price without it ever having to actually happen.

No. Markets are about expectations but if said expectation isn't met then markets go the other way and they do it fast. I did 10 years on a Goldman prop desk that was quite literally my job.

&gt;Bank of England printing money to finance government debt is all that is necessary to keep the yields on government debt low, the BoE doesn't have to actually do it. So long as the BoE can do it,

Which is why Russia with their independent bank was able to borrow at very low rates in perpetuity? Oh, no that's not true. The Ruble fell 30% in a day and they had to raise interest rates to 12% to protect it.

&gt;British government debt is therefore very attractive to investors, so demand is high, and yields stay low.

British government debt is attractive because the BoE is buying it (this is the definition of quantitative easing) and it is perceived that we are cutting our deficit. Which keeps the market happy.

null,false,ggow,null,null,null,"It depends. If the factory relies a lot on imported raw materials and parts, a strengthening pound would mean the costs for those went down (in pound terms). The wages, debt repayments, rent, locally sourced materials etc. are all going to be denominated in pounds. Depending on the factors leading to the devaluation, the production cost should stay similar or drop. As such, the pound-terms break even might drop a little. It is unlikely, however, to be enough to maintain the same profit margins and relative price in dollars. 

To illustrate, pre-strengthening, manufacturing costs 90p and you sell at a pound. That pounds worth a dollar, so you sell at a dollar. 

After strengthening, manufacturing costs drop to 88p. To continue selling at a dollar, after a 10% strengthening you need to sell at 91p to maintain your market position in the states. Your profit margin has collapsed by 70%. That's obviously not ideal and has knock on consequences elsewhere. 

That said, it does depend on the composition of the product. It is conceivable that a stronger currency could cause manufacturing costs to drop (though its unlikely). It is also possible that if you offer a specialist product, the market will just need to bear the price bump, so your profit margin is unaffected. 


Let's put this another way, if there are no disbenefits to a strong currency, why does everyone say Germany is benefiting from a EUR that is weak, vis-à-vis a Deutsch Mark, and that Greece should exit the EZ to have a devalued drachma? Why does the US rail on China for currency manipulation and why were the UK Government ecstatic at the pound dropping in the crisis? The answer is, it's a relatively painless way of boosting relatively competitivity levels (and the inflation boost wasn't unwelcome for the UK either).

Only difference is you'll be on site for cheaper commute if / when your presence is needed (but the tenants will also have easier access to you, so it'll be more costly to ignore minor complaints. The risks are still much the same. There is some advantage for eviction purposes, since tenant law / rights is stricter than lodger ... but, in the scheme of things it's a minor consideration.

Without the specifics of the property deal though (projected percentage yield vs mortgage rate against value + estimated fees inc. maintenance), it's impossible to say.


From a personal POV (which can impact on health and the ability to work) you'll potentislly be living with your debtors, which might be hellish. Tenants (even with careful screening) can be very unpredictable - there are plenty of horror stories available. If something happens, you'll have no insulation from it.

There are advantages and disadvantages. Not saying 'Don't!' ... but it's not as easy as people imagine (otherwise everyone would do it).

Yeah swimsuits probably won't be needed! Though saying that I hear Kent has some nice beaches, and honestly during summer it does feel very warm, especially in the south, even if the thermometer says otherwise, so you could in theory. I personally wouldn't as you can always buy a swimsuit if you desperately need one. Though you can still easily bring tshirts and shorts (you're crazy if you wear shorts in winter though!). Jeans or Trousers (Pants to you) definately. You'll need to learn to love a rain coat and if you don't have one, get one, then another one - these are a must in my opinion if you are living here, get them with a hood (says the guy with a coat with no hood). One thick one for winter, a thinner one for summer. Tshirt + thin coat in summer, tshirt + thick coat in winter, and a jumper (think you would call this a sweater) on particularly cold days (every day). 

Yeah that might work, might be out of luck if they don't smoke though! Try buying a pint for them, they'll love you soon enough! :P Joking aside, pubs are a good way to get to meet people if you are worried about meeting people. This might be handy for you: http://www.sirc.org/publik/pub.html

Ribery, they signed him from Marseille. For whatever reasons, even other big clubs weren't after his signature. At that time, they couldn't even compete with us in the transfer market. We went after Malouda instead when we had the chance. The other notable players on their team were signed from other German teams and the vast majority of them their contract was up.

It was only recently that they spent lots of money to get Neymar and Suarez. Some fans on this sub are obsessing with how big these teams are and how they will get our star players. Ask yourself have they ever signed a star player from us? Arjen Robben was injury prone and at that time he wasn't nearly as good as Hazard is for us now.

I think it's already been mentioned but you can only use your US license for 6 or 12 months, after that time you'll have to apply for a UK one.  Whether that requires a driving test or I'm not sure.

I've replied above but I'll comment on this as well. Nobody is arguing that the Lib Dems betrayed them because they failed to enact certain parts of party policy - this is obviously to be expected of a coalition and especially so of the smaller party.



Instead the feeling of betrayal is because each Lib Dem candidate personally signed a pledge to vote against any rise in fees. A pretty clear statement of voting intentions!

Also, I'd say our squad's better as well. And I'd bet we've got better training facilities as well.

I'm not saying that Liverpool's more attractive to him than Lyon, especially since you've made a pretty good argument, but theres definitely advantages that we hold over Lyon.

Your take? I'm honestly surprised, unless Jose decides he'd rather just replace Drogba with another winger, and only have 2 strikers next year. Bamford would be 3rd choice and train with the team, but he really wouldn't be on the bench for most games. Plus Cuadrado has experience playing up top as a 2nd striker, so maybe he feels it's unnecessary to have another striker, and would rather bring in some more competition for Oscar and Willian?

null,false,OkToBeTakei,tennant,Tennant,null,"It's a good effort. From a professional standpoint, here are a few criticisms:

- the TARDIS doesn't have enough depth-of-movement. By that, I mean that it stays to close to the 'camera' and doesn't explore the space as much as it does in the original version. In the original version, it moves around, exploring the space vortex, bouncing about. This gives the feeling that it is inside of something, the vortex, and that it is moving within it, that it is not just set against a background, but that it is traveling *through* it, giving it an added dimension of dynamic motion, making it seem like a richer object and experience. Also, the *way* it moves in the original sequence is *playful*, which sets a tone for the Doctor and the show itself: chaotic, unpredictable, yet playful, and fun.

- the text is 2D and also lacks the sorts of clever playful fluidic dynamic motion, but I assume you're a student and getting experience with this. I expect that with more practice, you'll start picking up on the techniques that allow you to imbue what you're creating with the subtle nuances that bring these characteristics out in your work.

- also, it was short, but it was a demo, so that's ok.

Quality was very good. I'd say keep it up. I didn't see your previous work, so I can't really make any sort of comparative analysis to that. I was mostly paying attention to the TARDIS because, in the Who intro, that's definitely the hardest part to capture/reproduce, and you're mostly there. It's a character as much as any other in the show, and you have to get it just-so.

I suggest you keep re-watching the intro until your eyes bleed, and keep it up in after effects and maya or whatever you're using until your processor explodes and your mouse runs screaming. Eventually, you'll be a rock star.

Good luck, and keep posting!

I really do wonder why Rodgers insists on using a formation as long it works up until it stops working. It's good to go with what works, but when you need to change things up you're left with a big question mark. We have a lot of new players that don't see much time. I don't see why we didn't mix up formations during cup matches just to get a feel for the players. We struggled in the beginning of the season and maybe once we started winning he felt confidence was more important to save the season than learning multiple formations.

If anyone is curious, my updated analysis of profanity rates and my new team sub activity rate analysis is still pending, as I ran into a bunch of subreddits that my script just gets stuck on for days on end, but it will happen. It ended up taking so long on some of the data that I may re-run it all for accuracy's sake, using several more computers to get an accurate simultaneous read, instead of the 4 I was using (we crushed the cunts on both counts with my current data, by the way.)

You'll probably have more luck than I did with the online sellers b/c the game you want to go to likely won't have as much demand, but who knows...just be really careful with those online guys. If they're acting weird then just blow them off. It's easier to avoid getting ripped off when you're dealing with touts on the street.

If you do end up attempting to scalp out front, know what to look for. Scalpers/touts often stand around in groups, very rarely if ever wear colors (kits or scarves, etc), and just generally look like dirt bags. Don't let on that you're desperate, and have a starting price ready for them. If you're way too far apart, just tell them no thanks for a bit while you keep an eye on the crowd for an extra ticket. The closer it gets to kick, the more desperate they'll get to unload. If they have paper tickets it should be pretty obvious whether or not it's genuine...just make sure to check the date to ensure it's not from last year's match or something. If they offer you a fan card try to arrange a half-now-half-later type deal so that if you get ripped off, at least you won't get ripped off 100%. Show them the full amount, but tell them you'll give them the rest when you return the fan card later...legit sellers seem to be cool with this usually. One time I did the fan card thing with a guy who stayed outside the ground, the other time I went in with a family who had an extra card the dad couldn't use...in that case I gave them some up front and the rest when we were through the turnstiles and in the seats.

Anyway, if you're ready to make a deal when you get there but are also smart enough to keep from getting your pants pulled down, I'm fairly confident you can get a ticket in the hour before kickoff.

It's an entirely personal question really and, for me, not particularly important. It doesn't occupy enough of my thoughts. If someone wants to say they're British, Irish, Northern Irish or some combination of them then go for it.

My mothers parents were born in Belfast but the ""family"" were from Donegal and the ""family home"" is still up there in a relatives possession. Fathers side from Belfast going back at least a few generations. Growing up where I did (North Down) I always identified as British because that's just what seemed patently obvious. It was the BBC when you turned the TV on. It was BT when you wanted your phone line put in. It was the Queen on the money in your pocket. When you voted it was in UK elections. When you left school you got GCSEs rather than a leaving certificate. When you wanted to waste resources on a sore throat you went and got yourself sorted out in the ""NHS"" (no one needs to explain that technically the NHS doesn't exist in NI to me btw). I never really thought of myself as Northern Irish but I'm not denying that I certainly am Northern Irish. The term just seemed secondary to British. More of a ""narrowing it down"" term as I'm obviously *not* Welsh or English or Scottish. I am however British just like the Welsh, English and Scots.

Those are just a few small everyday things of course. The Republic never felt particularly ""foreign"" to me or anything but it certainly wasn't home. Any time spent there had a different feel perhaps because of stuff mentioned above being absent. When I went to Scotland for Uni I had no feelings of ""difference"" at all. It was essentially identical to home bar the accents for me.

I've lived in Canada for a few years now and that is certainly ""home"" for me now. I don't call myself Canadian as I'm not even a citizen yet but if I'm still here in another 20 or 30 years I'm sure I'll be more Canadian than British simply by virtue of spending so much more of my life there. Over here I do say I'm ""British"" or ""Irish"" when asked because it's simply not worth the effort of saying ""Northern Irish"". It would be like saying ""I'm Cornish"". No one really gives a squirt here and the questioner is always just wondering what the accent is because it sounds a bit Irish and a bit Scottish and people in Canada (and America) are woeful at detecting where an accent is from. Is nice to run into people from Northern Ireland though. Bumped into a bloke in the next building over from mine and turned out he was from Comber. I was born in Bangor. The world is small enough I guess.

So basically I'd self describe as British. I have an Irish passport too because if you're offering it who am I to say no?",null,0,null,1427949680,null,0,1427949925,0,cpylhjd,null,t3_311tsx,null,t1_cpylhjd,null,t3_311tsx,null,null,null,1432149520,null,2,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,2,null

null,false,michael2l,null,null,null,"Thanks. I'm sympathetic to why fans are upset, and sometimes I find myself having those same emotions.  But I also feel bad for Sterling that he feels like he needs to defend himself. As an athlete you are in a weird position because you have zero possibility of being able to work until the sort of ages that most people retire at.  So you have to maximize your revenue opportunities when they come your way.  On top of that he is constantly dealing with the risk of an injury that either ends his career or drops his performance to a level where his ability to command a premium salary goes away overnight.  He has huge sunk opportunity costs as well since he hasn't spent this portion of his life going through the education and career training that other people his age are doing so when his career is over he may not have any real future career options.  He doesn't seem to be the charismatic sort that will have a career in the media after this given how he's botched his attempts at PR so far.

On top of all this he also has the additional risk that all his so called potential never materializes.  So while that potential and hype are bankable he probably should grab that money because there are no guarantees he'll live up to it.  I honestly think that risk is greatest if he ends up leaving Liverpool and has to compete with squad players at the Real Madrid's or Manchester City's of the world, but even if he gets all the playing time in the world, he still might not be what everyone hopes he will be.  That's also why I'm ok with Liverpool selling him if the price is right.  That's their opportunity to cash in on his potential without taking the risk that he doesn't pan out.  And they have him on 35K wages until 2017 so they have plenty of leverage here.   I have very little doubt that Liverpool is going to do well in this transaction whatever happens.  I do worry that this whole thing leaves a bad taste in Sterling's mouth which sours his relationship with the club, but hopefully not.",null,0,null,1427949724,null,0,false,0,cpyli64,null,t3_312kv8,null,t1_cpyli64,null,t1_cpy58ad,null,null,null,1432149528,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

I genuinely abhor this kind of lazy criticism. Has the club been sat on their hands and been ""hmmm Alexis Sanchez is maybe *too* worldclass and expensive for us, we should really give Aspas another shot"".

No they tried to get Sanchez and he decided to go somewhere else. They tried for Mkhitaryan, Salah etc and they decided to go somewhere else. I don't think it was about the offer or the wages, it was about achieving consistency in CL qualification. 

We had to buy a squad to compete on 4 fronts this season, regardless of well or badly we did in them eventually, the transfer target at the beginning of the season was to fill numerous holes and generally expand the squad. This means buying more players rather than fewer/ more expensive players. We tried the marquee signing with Balotelli and it hasn't really worked out so far. 

Has our transfer strategy been a success? Not quite. Are the club simply refusing to go after world class players? Obviously not. You want a dose of reality? most top shelf players don't see Liverpool as a destination club unless they are fans or have some other connection.

Worst of all, it sets a horribly irreversible precedent for our other youth players, as well as the existing in-form players (Coutinho?). Arguably, Sterling's biggest draw is that he is only 20 and still has so much time to improve and potentially become world class on top of his already fantastic play. Sure, if you compare him to other 20 year olds he is clearly at or near the top. That said, if FSG play hardball and refuse to hand him such an inflated contract and end up selling him for some extraordinary figure… Well, we could probably buy a slightly older player in their prime that can immediately offer us more than what Sterling currently is.

Clearly we don't have a reluctance to spend money, please tell me where we have lost out on a world class player because we weren't ready to spend the money? Where is this pool of world class players that would have signed for us if only we'd offered X-amount more? Do you think Sanchez would have come here if we'd offered 10 million more to Barca then Arsenal?

Criticize the committee for failing to identify better prospects, I'm with you, criticize them for over-paying on some talent, I'd agree, criticize them for not moving fast enough to get players who moved to other clubs at a similar level to us, agreed. Criticize them for not understanding that sometimes short-term buys for players above a certain age can be hugely valuable as Chelsea have shown.
 
But to say that they are somehow low balling attempts at top shelf players is just too simplistic to be true. We can't offer them ridiculously large pay packets or hyper-inflated transfer fee's like PSG or City because we'd be screwed with FFP. We can offer them a competing price but they're not gonna come here if they can go somewhere else with regular CL and chance at trophies.

Through experience of renting many many houses, you can handle living in a worse looking warm house, than a nice cold house - especially went winter hits and you feel too poor to put the heating on. Inadequate heating can also cause damp problems which are awful to live with,

So yeah, check for Gas Central Heating when looking at listings, its usually abbreviated to 'GCH'.

Edit. I'll expand my point although I don't want to get into a huge debate about this because it just goes in circles.

Financial services ensure that capital is allocated efficiently around the world.

If you cannot allocate capital efficiently or are unable to then your economy seizes up. That's  what's happened since 08. Banks have been unable or unwilling to lend to the real economy and thus productivity has remained weak.

You can also tell he's a crackpot by saying that there is some kind of inherent collusion between the political class and finance.

Just a word of warning about the weather, its not necessarily the cold thats the worst part (it only gets truly freezing for a couple of weeks a year), but its the wet and dank days continually for months and months which gets people down. 

I know alot of expats, a few yanks included, and they all say this is the hardest part. Not that its freezing, but that you can genuinely go months without seeing the sun properly, and that you constantly need to remember your umbrella. They say February is the hardest month, mainly because christmas is over and its a couple of months before the weather gets better. Just be prepared for that, considering you're so used to the sun. Maybe invest in a vitamin D lamp, or try to go outside for a walk for 20 mins a day at lunchtime, so your body can get enough sun light. Maybe plan a foreign holiday for just after christmas, or around easter so you get to see the sun. It will make you feel so much better.

There's no decorations though. Supermarkets and the like will have pictures of the Easter bunny and eggs but in the home there's nothing different done. 

Visitors centres and activity places, castles and everything in between will usually have special events for Easter. Certainly an Easter egg hunt and probably some kind of egg painting event as well to entice families in. Schools are usually off for two weeks, one either side of Easter weekend, so it's a well-known holiday in the UK. However, whilst there are plenty of church services on, as you said religion is less of a factor here and I don't know anyone who observes it religiously. I'm sure plenty do though. 

Good Friday and Easter Monday are public holidays so most people are off work and have a long weekend, but Easter Sunday is considered the 'official' day. That's when the eggs are exchanged and eaten. Children can get anywhere between 1-15 eggs depending on family and will often eat them all in one day.

I went to university in Canterbury (a while ago now I must admit). It is a beautiful place and there are a lot of students and hippies around as well as a more conservative older local population. 

You should be able to find somewhere to rent with the dog, but you will probably need to rent from a private landlord. I suspect you are more likely to find pet friendly places in the surrounding villages rather than in Canterbury itself. To live there and take advantage of the best spots, a car is advised. You might find that if you talk to the right people, you can get a banger cheap.

In terms of nature, it is one of the most interesting places in the SE. There are still small patches of the primordial forests that once covered all of the British Isles, complete with flora and fauna only found there. Check out Blean woods. 

Rent wasn't too bad when I was there, however, the SE of England is one of the most expensive places in the world in terms of real estate costs.

Canterbury has a weekly market with cheap produce and meat as well as all the big supermarket chains. However, as a bit of a foodie, I urge you to buy local as much as possible, since there are some of the best ingredients in the UK nearby - Kent is known as the Garden of England. So apples, pears and their products are a big deal. Go to the Cherry Tree in town and have a pint of Biddendens. Try and walk home in a straight line. If you want to know more about local produce, go to Canterbury Wholefoods for good vegan stuff or the Goods Shed for more expensive, gourmet stuff. 

The whole phone scenario is cheaper and easier in the UK and in the EU in general than in the US. Provided you are not contractually tied, you can probably bring your old handset, get it ""unlocked"" and then use a ""pay as you go sim"" data isn't too expensive. 

Libraries are libraries. 

No on in Canterbury is going to judge you for wearing jeans. Just for being an American. I am only half joking. But if you are working on the campus, then loads of people are foreign anyway.

You will be cold in Winter, Spring and Autumn. If you rent somewhere that is bills inclusive, then great. Wear wool, not cotton. That way when you get rained on you stay warm.

The difference in the weather between somewhere like Kent and the Midlands can be fairly dramatic.

Apparently there was a massive storm the other day with very destructive winds. Down on the coast it was a lovely, bright, spring day. I had no idea other parts of the country were getting battered.

IME, Kent has the best weather in the UK. Being to the east, its protected from the Atlantic weather fronts and being south, its obviously warmer.

The theory was based on two data points, one in Canada and one in New Zealand, who reduced government expenditure while expanded GDP (each in boom times while supported by a health US and austerlia respectively). The paper that stated this was rebuked for shoddy econometrics (the infamous RR paper). The IMF changed their advice and warned against austerity during a recession (which is the relevant context) since, like you say, it is clearly contractionary. The U.S. changed their plan, and since then they've been scratching their head wondering why everyone else is still going down the austerity root.

I also don't think he's worth breaking the bank for.  I think we should hold relatively firm and it'll get sorted eventually without being bullied skywards in cash terms.

I'd also hope he'd realise what a good thing he has going.  He's part of a promising young team, with a promising young manager that is genuinely going places.  And he can be the star.  It's not about us having 'made him', or him owing us, but it's probably (again, biased, I know) the best place for him to continue to develop.  If he continues on his trajectory then, yes, he might be replacing Bale in a couple of years and we'll get £100m for him and he'll get whatever size bucketload of money he desires - and he'll go straight into their first team.

""German economic growth has always been export-led. Berlin’s priorities after World War II were thus to invest in rebuilding the country’s capital stock (which meant keeping a lid on domestic consumption) and to recover export markets (which meant keeping costs, and thus wages, low). With external demand more important than internal demand, growth was determined by competitiveness and monetary stability, not domestic consumption. All government stimulus programs would do in this system is increase the costs of production and lower export demand.

This is a great economic model for a supply-side, export-led economy with a strong monetary authority and supercompetitive products. The problem is that, like the Highlander, there can be only one. Not every European country can be a Germany and run a surplus; others need to run deficits, just as for someone to save, someone else needs to spend. Unfortunately, Germany was able to design the key institutions of the EU and the eurozone in its own image, creating a strong competition authority and an extremely independent and inflation-obsessed central bank. So in the moment of the Greek crisis, Germany’s particular objection to Keynesianism was translated into the prevailing policy stance for an entire regional economy, with disastrous results. 

Germany could afford to cut its way to growth, since the sources of its growth lay outside its borders: it is the export champion of the world. But the whole of Europe cannot play that trick""",null,0,null,1427962637,null,0,false,0,cpyp72c,null,t3_313unt,null,t1_cpyp72c,null,t1_cpyp0tq,null,null,null,1432151337,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

If you've got some kind of insight into the market, or if you'll get some kind of special deal on this particular property, that's a different conversation. If you're wanting flatmates but don't want to rent anymore, that's a different conversation... but from a strictly financial POV you'd probably fare better maxing out your ISA and pension contributions, by taking a smaller mortgage, and upsizing *when* needed.

Evicting someone is traumatic, for everyone involved. Apart from this, It only takes one bad tenant to ruin a business model (you can destroy a house's plumbing with a well placed loo roll, for instance). This is (one of many reasons) why mortgage lenders won't consider rental income as security - it's extremely risky / uncertain. You're talking about subsidizing repairs and maintenance?! Can you afford to have nice things in the first place? Will you buy the couch you want or the couch that will survive? If there's a problem with the heating you'll be *obliged* to fix it, even if you don't currently have the money - you'll *have* to maintain an emergency fund magnitude's higher than for your own expenses. ... Whether the rooms are filled or not, you're still required to work and invest - how confident are you of keeping the rooms occupied with *desirable* tenants known to you, rather than the latest Craig's list ad? What about the inevitable invoices and bills attached to the property by past tenants?

None of these are definite reasons not to proceed, but being a landlord is time consuming, and being a live in landlord is almost a lifestyle choice. The margins aren't much different that simply investing in a property index directly. Hopefully you've factored in the time commitment.

The thing is we don't know what's going to cause the next crash. And in fact I actually think he's wrong on this. Private sector debt isn't all that much of an issue anymore.

The real issues are in the bond market which has very little regulatory oversight and where controls have been put in place to stop banks being able to absorb excesses in the market.

Asda is Walmart.  Tesco is like an old-school Kroger, spartan but has good food.  General comparison may be Giant Eagle.  Sainsbury is one of those Kroger Marketplace places.  Waitrose is expensive, but I find they have the best vegetables.  They're kind of on part with Randall's (Texas chain) insofar as quality and price.

You're going to find that where you shop is more dependent on where you live.  If you live close to something you'll shop there more because it's just plain harder to get around than you're likely used to.  For example, public transportation infrastructure is great.  But it doesn't run everywhere and have a ton of connections, compared to a big city in the US.  Instead, there are set lines that go ""close enough"".  Navigating a car in some cities (I'M LOOKING AT YOU OXFORD!) is difficult to the extreme.  And, in some places, you have roads that are closed at times and open at others.  

Get a Costco membership in the States.  They can limit who can apply for one in the UK to business owners or employees of certain businesses.  But, if you get one in the States, they don't question it and just accept it.

Also, get a frequent flyer card for some place in the States.  When ordering tickets to go home you often get a cheaper price, dollars-wise, than if you order in GBP.  On a similar note, keep a US credit card.  Getting a UK bank account as a US person is difficult due to some newish rules put in place.  Also, if you have USAA then keep them and use them for car/renters insurance.  Much cheaper.  There's only about a 10% chance the people you're using for insurance will transfer to the UK.

PM me if you want more details.

EDIT: Car stuff.

With your US license you can drive on UK roads for 12 months.  But, as someone else has said, you need to get a UK driver's license.  Since you can drive a manual you'll be OK as long as you study.  The test is MUCH harder than it is in the US.

That said, you should start the application for your UK license AS SOON AS YOU ARE LEGALLY ALLOWED, which if I recall is 6 months after you move over.  It'll take you a computer exam and a practical test with a driver to get your license.  Failure rate for both if high, but if you've been driving a long time it should come easier to you.  Some people hire a driving instructor.  I didn't, but really studied the test material and online training material.  There's a lot of it.

People have mentioned ride sharing programs, but they aren't rolled out everywhere.  That said, the used car scene here is very different than the US.  You can find a good-enough roughly used car for anywhere from 250-750 GBP.  Note that you still have to insure, pay road tax, and pay for an MOT sticker (yes, I know it's electronic now) every year.  But, if you play your cards right, you can buy the car with tax and MOT paid for nearly a year.  Saves on expenses quite a bit.

Flexible labour markets have been good for the UK. Fears that the recession would leave three million unemployed proved groundless, and since the recovery gained steam the increasing number in work has been nothing short of astonishing.
British workers deserve much of the credit for reacting to the slowdown by accepting less pay and hours. But labour market rules gave them little choice. In the UK, when there is less work to go around, it is the boss who decides how it is shared out. Collective bargaining has largely retreated to the public sector. Elsewhere, employers can easily vary conditions, lay off staff, and hire them again when the economy picks up.

Greater peace of mind for the boss comes at the expense of job security. This includes the widespread use of contracts that guarantee no work at all. Ed Miliband, the Labour party leader, this week vowed to fight the apparent growth in this phenomenon by giving zero-hours workers the right to permanent work after just three months.
Mr Miliband’s vow should be seen for what it is — a campaign announcement designed to position Labour on the side of the beleaguered worker. While the Tories were proclaiming their endorsement from corporate Britain, Mr Miliband was taking up arms for cleaners and shop staff unsure of their next pay packet. He was no doubt emboldened by the prime minister’s recent televised confession that he could not live on a zero-hours contract.


Electoral opportunism aside, Labour has good cause to focus on what has become an emblem of Britain’s low-wage economy. Lighter rules around hire and fire may have kept a lid on unemployment, but have done nothing to shift British workers into more productive occupations. Indeed, some economists charge Britain’s flexible labour market with making a crisis in productivity worse. Staff that can be easily picked up and discarded provide companies with little reason to invest in making them more effective.


But this attempt to regulate against job insecurity is unlikely to succeed. Far too little is known about zero-hours work. It is hard to distinguish greater awareness of the phrase from increased use of the contract. The best guess is that just 2 per cent of all staff work on such terms. Most such workers report being happy with how they are treated. Indeed, zero-hours contracts ease the path to much work that is beneficial to all concerned, such as students or retirees looking to earn a little more on the side.


There are bound to be practical difficulties, given that what Labour proposes is effectively to force employers to offer permanent contracts against their will. The more unscrupulous would wiggle around any new restriction, for example by ceasing to employ staff after 10 weeks, or keeping them on minimal rather than zero hours. Labour market enforcement relies on staff taking their chances in court; few such workers could stomach the risk. The state cannot legislate against employers simply refusing to hire staff on anything but the company’s terms.


There is nothing inherently unfair about a zero-hours contract. But it is clearly unfair to treat as temporary a worker who is effectively committed permanently to one employer. Even ineffective changes to the rules can shift behaviour when they reflect a moral consensus. Mr Miliband’s intervention will not fix low-wage Britain: only a sustained rise in productivity can do that. But it could signal the limits of what is acceptable treatment of those struggling at the bottom of the labour market. For an election campaign that may be good enough.

&gt;AMD affects around 26,000 people each year in the UK and if left untreated can cause blindness.

&gt; Correct me if I’m wrong, as I am sure you have done lots and lots of research on this topic, but just 10% of the Gypsy andTraveller population are actually Irish Travellers. The majority, like myself, are in fact Romany, yet your ‘documentary’ seems to ignore our existence. While I have nothing but respect for the Irish Traveller community, you seem to be unaware that we are two distinct ethnic groups and thus there are many differences between our cultures. While Irish Travellers originate from Ireland, we can trace our routes back to India, so it was hardly surprising that I was somewhat confused when you use the word Gypsy in the title of your ‘documentary’ about Irish Travellers. I was even more confused when your ‘documentary’ about Irish Travellers seemed to feature an alien culture that even most Irish Traveller’s didn’t recognise.

I had believed the Irish Travellers were the majority and wasn't even aware that the term ""gypsy"" is specific to the Romany people. There's clearly a lot of misrepresentation in the Big Fat Gypsy Wedding show.

I'm from Southampton, so I can fully appreciate how easily these sensationalist assholes from the TV claiming to make a ""documentary"" can misrepresent a community. Selective use of footage and clever editing can spin anything into a grossly exaggerated extreme. 

Where I'm less sympathetic is in the claim that the state education is irrelevant to their way of life. We have a national curriculum in an age of technology, computing, etc, and it can't be tailored to suit those who are essentially unwilling or unable to get to grips with the contemporary economy. Those who do, like the author of the letter and her sister who are both in education should probably push their communities to do better in this regard.

&gt; We are not a joke, we are human beings and your work of fiction is only strengthening stereotypes and ignorance.

100%. BFGW is entirely made for us to point and laugh at extreme examples of Irish Travellers. 

&gt;  The myths that you have been spreading have not helped matters. Indeed, I was subjected to physical attacks during your last series of your ‘documentary’ which ultimately led to my expulsion from school (long story), whilst my 12 year old cousin was beat up on her way home from school by a gang of girls who were calling her a prostitute.

And this is the end result of such sensationalist TV show productions. BFGW certainly isn't helping the gypsy/traveller people integrate with the rest of society - it's driving a bigger wedge.

&gt;but I'm worried that I may end up spending a fortune on heating costs.

Be careful. When I was in the US (and I'm from the Southern US) we kept our heat on a lot longer there. The heating bill was much, much, much cheaper in the US. The heaters here are not like the US ones that come out of a vent. They're radiators that are stuck on a wall. A LOT of people who move here (including Americans, Canadians, and Russians) complain about the ""cold, damp"" feeling inside houses and flats. If you can't afford heating, buy a sleeping bag. Yes, I am serious.  

&gt;Are produce and meat very expensive?

The milk (and bread?) here I think is much cheaper than the US. Everything else is sort of similar if you make a similar amount of money. Chicken wings are super cheap here, like less than half the US price. 

&gt;How much does one typically spend on food to cook at home?

Tough question. Depends on how frugal you are. A friend of mine eats at Aldi for on £20 a week. I spent £50 a week (and didn't eat restaurant food) back when I had money.

&gt;can I get a cheap data plan on a phone there?

I think the UK has some of the cheapest phone plans. What my mother pays $75 a month for in the US I can get for £15 here. 

&gt;Is it still true that I don't need a car?

Depends on *where* in Kent you live. I think there's areas that are close to London there. It's like saying Pennsylvania looks rural -- of course it does if you aren't looking at Philadelphia.

&gt;Can you still borrow books and use the internet for free at libraries?

Yes. Now for something interesting: I've live in a nice area (and moved from a similarly nice area) but the libraries are much, much smaller and to get a book from another library (interlibrary loan) costs £1.50. The computers are also a great deal older. Many library block a lot of webpages. 

&gt;Are blue jeans really not ok for everyday wear (or for hitting up a bar/pub/getting drinks)?

This is not true at all. In fact, I think in the seven odd years I've been here, people are more casual than they used to be. Even my student from Paris wears jeans all the time. Older people here do sometimes dress more formally. 

Levis here (and I guess most of the world?) is marked as a premium brand. In Paris, they'd sell levis for 100 euros, and the same pair would be $40 in the US! 

If you live near a supermarket, you might as well get a loyalty card. It's nectar for sainsburys, miles and more for morrisons (which sucks by the way), club card for tesco. Aldi and Lidl don't have any, but they're cheaper anyway.

**Trafalgar Square was a mountain of black garbage bags twitching with rats. The nice thing about electricity shortages was that they were announced on the wireless, by area, beforehand. Candles could not be found in hardware stores, but were plentiful in Harrods. We used Artic candles and camping lanterns. One could be somewhat prepared. No bread? They flew in bread from France until that was stopped and, if there was flour in the house, one had to bake (or not). The worst strike for many was on throwaway nappies. I am sure that hurt many people. I seem to remember contests of how to get along with tiny amounts of water - winners combined boiling food, washing dishes, bathing, washing clothes and finally, using the remains to water the garden, in about the same order with the same water. Hosepipes were banned in London. An old man in our neighbourhood used to so slowly pace his green front garden after dark with a hosepipe down his trousers so no one could see it. Sixteen strikes at one time, as I remember. Every day a new challenge. **

Holding the opinion that their policies have not had a positive impact on the economy does not mean that you believe their policies have had a negative impact on the economy.

You may simply believe their policies have been ineffective or of negligible importance and that the economy has simply trundled on regardless.

Obviously loaded questions (looking for a specific answer) are obvious... they then trundle out a couple of quotes from people who seriously object to the policies, implying that their opinions represent the entirety of those two thirds...

They did concede to a little bit of balance at the bottom where one guy says austerity was sound and necessary, but should have been eased earlier.

The practice essentially involves getting one big vial of Avastin and prepping many (around 50) single-use versions of it for use in Wet AMD. It's essentially a (false) economy of scale - the dose you take for Avastin is much bigger than Lucentis. 

The problem comes about with lax practices at the compounding pharmacies which can lead to cases like this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Compounding_Center_meningitis_outbreak . On opening a vial, it's often said to no longer be sterile. 

This paper goes into much greater detail on the dangers of compounding Avastin for opthalmic use: http://archopht.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1905284, but as a tl;dr here's the abstract: 

&gt;Bevacizumab acquired from compounding pharmacies for intravitreal injection may cause infectious and noninfectious inflammation. In addition to safety issues, the drug itself may have variable efficacy associated with product aliquoting, handling, and distribution.

null,false,apple_kicks,null,null,null,"&gt;Far too little is known about zero-hours work. It is hard to distinguish greater awareness of the phrase from increased use of the contract. The best guess is that just 2 per cent of all staff work on such terms.

[The Office of national statistics](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/lmac/contracts-with-no-guaranteed-hours/zero-hour-contracts--2014/index.html) has more details than a guess.


Zero hours [I think anyway] works for with people with small children and students who need to pick and choose their hours and earn at least minimum wage (since its protected by  National Minimum Wage Act 1998). Also popular for farmers who need to hire people to harvest fields. 

Issues are employers using the ZH contracts in ways where it doesn't benefit the worker. I think there are reports of it being used after the economic crisis by companies who previously would have hired then as employees rather than workers. If paid little enough the worker could lose out on their state pension. Also there were reports of people on ZH contracts being denied work.

&gt;[Under UK law a distinction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-hour_contract#United_Kingdom) is drawn between a mere ""worker"" and an ""employee,"" an employee having more legal rights than a worker.[21] Whether a person working under a zero-hour contract is an employee or a worker can be uncertain; however, even in cases where the plain text of the zero-hour contract designates the person as a ""worker"" courts have inferred an employment relationship based on the mutuality of obligation between employer and employee.

&gt;Social Security[edit]


&gt;Zero-hours contracts provide basic social security benefits;
Maternity/Paternity pay
Holiday
Health insurance

&gt;As long as a zero-hour contract employee earns less than £5,772 a year they will not receive any credits for the state pension.

&gt;Employers in the United Kingdom[edit]

&gt;Zero-hour contracts were being used in an increasing number of jobs after the global financial crisis in the private, non-profit, and public sectors in the United Kingdom:

&gt;Sports Direct,[23] a retailer, has 90% of its workers on zero-hour contracts

&gt;In August 2013, The Guardian reported that J D Wetherspoon, one of the UK's largest pub chains, has 24,000 staff, or 80% of its workforce, on contracts with no guarantee of work each week.[24]

&gt;90% of McDonald's workforce in the UK - 82,000 staff members - are employed on a zero-hour contract. According to a McDonald's spokesperson all work is scheduled in advance with no employees being ""on call"" and meets the needs of workers who desire or need a flexible schedule.[23]

&gt;Tesco uses zero hours contracts.[25]

&gt;A major franchise of Subway also uses the contracts, which state, ""The company has no duty to provide you with work. Your hours of work are not predetermined and will be notified to you on a weekly basis as soon as is reasonably practicable in advance by your store manager. The company has the right to require you to work varied or extended hours from time to time."" Subway workers are also required, as a condition of employment, to waive their rights to limit their workweek to 48 hours.[23]

&gt;Burger King franchisees and Domino's Pizza operations in the UK extensively use zero-hour contracts.[26]

&gt;The Spirit Pub Company has 16,000 staff on zero-hour contracts.[27]

&gt;Boots UK has 4,000.[27]

&gt;Buckingham Palace, which employs 350 seasonal summer workers, also uses them.[6][19]

&gt;The National Trust, a nonprofit organization which manages extensive historic sites and nature preserves in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, which must deal with variable weather, uses zero-hour contracts but at the same benefits and pay as permanent employees.[19] The Tate Galleries also use zero-hour contracts.[6]

&gt;All non-management staff at Curzon and Everyman cinema chains.[28]
Cineworld, a leading cinema chain, uses zero-hour contracts for 3,600 people, about 80% of its workforce, and Stephen Wiener, the founder, stated in August 2013 that he will continue using them.[29]

&gt;The Workplace Employment Relations Survey conducted by the government of the UK in 2004 and 2011 shows that the proportion of workplaces that have some employees on zero-hours contracts has increased from 4% in 2004 to 8% in 2011. The survey found that larger companies are more likely to use zero-hours contracts. 23% of workplaces that have 100 or more employees used zero-hours contracts in 2011, compared to 11% of those with 50-99 employees and 6% of those with fewer than 50 employees.[22]

&gt;Workers subject to zero-hour contracts may be subject to exploitation as they may be denied work at any time for any reason, including declining to respond to a demand to work. A refusal to work in any one instance for any reason can result in a prolonged period of lack of work.[31] In 2014, millions of workers were still trapped in low-paid, highly insecure jobs, where mistreatment is the norm and where there is limited prospect of escape, said Trade Union Congress. [32] Due to the uncertainty of the workers' schedules zero-hour contracts present problems for workers with children due to the difficulty of arranging child care.[9]",null,0,null,1427968744,null,0,1427972317,0,cpyqdki,null,t3_3168bj,null,t1_cpyqdki,null,t3_3168bj,null,null,null,1432151894,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

Although there were miners’ strikes in 1972 and 1974 and further action in nationalised industries and in the so-called ‘winter of discontent’ 1978/79, these arose from very real and legitimate wage grievances as unions tried to ensure their members’ pay kept pace with inflation.

Most of the unions’ industrial actions of the period were reactive, either seeking to resist wage or job cuts, or political attacks such as the 1972 Industrial Relations Act. At the time of the Winter of Discontent inflation was at 10% while the government set pay rises at 5% - 5% real terms cut with a backdrop of public service cuts demanded by the IMF in return for its loan in 1976, itself caused by a capitalist fiscal crisis.

The strikes of the 70s were overblown by the media who had chosen Thatcher as heir apparent and were determined to oust Labour. The strikes had no lasting impact as opposed to the monetary policy about to be utilised by the government to destroy entire industries and whole communities. 

On this ridiculous notion of the unburied dead - there were two, unauthorised (i.e. non-union backed) strikes, one in London and one in Liverpool.

Here's a series of first hand accounts from the BBC on the era.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6729683.stm

I'll highlight some of them

**As a trainee engineer in 1976, I remember changing a toilet roll when on secondment to our Sheffield factory and being seriously worried that someone might find out and accuse me of doing somebody else's job. My predecessor had almost caused a strike by helping to sweep up some rubbish. The union's grip was total, and the atmosphere was poisonous. I don't agree with all that Margaret Thatcher did, but let's not pretend that drastic action was not required.
AJ, Dorset, UK**

**Candles... I was about 8/9 during the three-day week. Mum made it sound exciting like the Blitz but it wasn't. Apart from that my abiding memories is of dreariness, decay and depression apart from the summer of 76 of course
Andy Bell, Notts**

**As a 10-year-old in 1978 I remember the piles of garbage piled up in our local recreation ground in Stanmore (a council estate in a posh part of the UK) Winchester. The piles of rotten waste became our playground, well it always was our playground so we continued to play on the soccer pitch, rather than kicking a ball but investigating all the crap spilling out of the bags! I was lucky enough to find a whole bag of used syringes! I can't really recall what we did with them, but did tell me mum later what we had found and she rang the council office to complain, not that it did any good. The rubbish kept coming, and it's only now that I realise that all the council owned recreation areas were used as garbage disposal areas, the hallowed grounds of public school Winchester College, of course were unaffected, hence the working class got kicked in the balls by its own kind yet again! 
Slick McIntyre, Sydney, NSW**

**I don't remember all the political chaos, but I do remember playing Scrabble by candlelight and the fact that we couldn't bury my deceased grandfather. My mother never forgave Labour or the trade unions for that.
Carl Parry, Antalya, Turkey**

Children will usually get chocolate Easter eggs and adults may also exchange them. These are large hollow chocolate eggs, typically with a bag of sweets or chocolates inside. There's hundreds of varieties in your average supermarket. Pretty much every chocolate bar brand has an Easter egg and there's even luxury ones.

Cadbury's creme eggs and mini eggs (solid chocolate with a sugar shell), as well as other types of mini chocolate eggs, are extremely popular and often used in Easter egg hunts. The ""Easter bunny"" aka my mum used to hide them round the house and the garden and then I'd spend the morning searching for them. 

Other foods associated with Easter... mainly hot cross buns. Unlike Christmas, there's not really a meal strongly associated with Easter. People will usually make a big Sunday roast dinner and perhaps invite over friends or relatives. Lamb is common but not universal. People may also eat fish on Good Friday.

You essentially have no employment rights. Why? If your boss disagrees they can reduce to you zero hours without reason. Try to enforce your rights and they can punish you with no recourse. 

Do zero hours work for her? No. The employer can call her in whenever she wants but will not guarantee any time off and God help you if you refuse shifts, watch those hours drop. They are not flexible around the worker but the employer.

Does the torys removing non exclusivity help? No. She got offered Thursday's somewhere else but he current job will not guarantee thursdays off. They legally can't stop her working elsewhere but they can make it practically impossible to do.

We didn't rely on zero hours contracts in the past, they are not essential for business now.

For a little contrast, my mum works at a university and employs a student on zero hours. This is done so the student can stop working around exams if they wish but the same shifts each week are always available. In this case the flexibility is reversed.

Streaming is getting reduced, that's correct. What they do now is expect the teachers to essentially create three or more lesson plans per lesson for different ability groups, and more if there are severe learning difficulties or language barriers in your classroom. So rather than trying to teach a middle ground or a 'lowest common denominator', the teachers have to teach at all levels at once.

Looking for example at the Wikipedia entry for [Gypsy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gypsy), it suggests that it can refer to:

&gt; * Domba, an ethnic group in India
&gt; * Lom people, an ethnic group in Turkey and Armenia
&gt; * Lyuli, an ethnic group in Central Asia

&gt; * Sea Gypsies (disambiguation), several Southeast Asian nomadic groups living on houseboats
&gt; * Sri Lankan Gypsy people (also known as Sri Lankan Romani people), an ethnic group from South Asia
&gt; * Travellers and other traditionally itinerant groups in Europe, mostly of European ethnic origin
&gt;  * Indigenous Norwegian Travellers, a traditionally itinerant group, mostly of Norwegian origin
&gt;  * Irish Travellers (also known as Pavee), a traditionally itinerant group, mostly of Irish/British origin

I always struggle with that idea.  The problem is, ethics are not really immutable when faced with reality.  I for one think it's never acceptable to kill another human being, except for when it obviously is.  Do you deny any funding to a horrific regime, because it oppresses it's populous?  But things are worse if you deny the funding.  Is it better to deny those at the top the money that they will embezzle, even if it means 0% reaches those who need, rather than 20%.

Not to mention, some people consider porn immoral, and wouldn't support the industry at all, others a firm that promotes alternative lifestyles or LGBT.

Sadly all actions in a complex system will be unethical to some degree, the problem is, sometimes an inaction is 'less ethical'.

With statistics you have to be very careful what conclusions you draw. Here the only conclusion i see is that the number of people saying they have a good work life balance on zero hours contracts in comparable to those on other contracts. I dont know if the difference is significant, how the data is grouped, if people would prefer normal hours, if they are happy etc etc. happy != work life balance.

The reality is, they probably just want chips. Chips taste better than healthy food and they aren't educated enough to recognise that long term you're killing yourself by eating them every night.

Either that, or they've done a 12 hour shift every day and live near no supermarket and are just oh so tired (middle income and high income people only work 7 hours a day and don't get tired) so its not their fault they eat rubbish.

I love Bamford as a player but I personally believe it's too early to promote him to the First Team. Let him get some minutes in the EPL (there will undoubtably be a team wanting him, even if Middlesborough somehow collapse); and then promote him the season after, when he'll actually get minutes as a second choice striker rather than rot as third choice.

I think the most pressing issue is a backup for Matic. Mikel is a brilliant player to bring on after 80 minutes, but he's not a suitable replacement to play the full 90. Secondly I'd agree promote Loftus-Cheek and bring back Van Ginkel, they can cover for Fabregas/Rami.

Preferably, I'd move Azpi to the right, and bring in a new left back. Jose Gaya is a great talent from Valencia, and if we can beat interest from Madrid, he would thrive here. Alternatively, we give those minutes to Ake.

Sorry, but I was around then - that wasn't the prevailing attitude.

I take it by this you mean the period of global inflation that had to be addressed.

&gt;The strikes of the 70s were overblown by the media who had chosen Thatcher as heir apparent and were determined to oust Labour.

The strikes were overblown? Really? I'll assume you don't remember the lorry strikes, the rubbish piles, the electricity going off at 8pm, getting water from a standpipe in the road....there are plenty more examples, but I'm going to guess that you *weren't* around if you're prepared to insist that everyone didn't mind any of that and only voted Tory because a newspaper said so.

&gt;The strikes had no lasting impact

This statement only works if it follows a strict agenda (e.g. yours). The number of lorries on the roads today is just one legacy. There are plenty more.

* Make sure your crate is large enough for your dog. They're serious about measuring the leg lengths and such. I talked to someone at the animal reception centre whose dog got turned away because the crate was an inch too small. 

* Our vet's office knew what they were doing and everything went smoothly there. We ran into trouble with the USDA office. You have to get documents in a short period, so I hope you're close enough to your office to drive to it in a day if necessary. 

* After your dog is taken to the animal reception centre, it has to stay in their care for a few hours before they will release it to you. So don't plan on leaving the airport anytime soon after you landed.  Airlines differ in how quickly they get the animals to the centre after landing. From the others waiting while I was there, the consensus was you run into more trouble with American airlines. We flew Virgin Atlantic and our animals got there very quickly, but we had to pay more. The other person with a smooth arrival experience came from South Africa.

* Finding where to drop your animal off at your departing airport can be difficult. Virgin failed with their directions for O'Hare. We ended up 15 minutes later than the cutoff for cargo, but they fortunately helped us and got them on anyway. So leave extra, extra early!

It's kind of hard to speak for 2 minutes even if you speak English as a first language. I speak more than 2 languages. At no point have I felt that I was lagging behind. But here is the thing? 

A large amount of people have simply assumed I can't speak English  well. I spoke better English than many of the ethnically English people in my classes in school. What's different is the accent and understanding of colloquialisms. 

If I said ""It's Brass Monkeys out there"", many of us would get it. If you weren't from the UK it would confuse the fuck out of you. It's the same with words such as Rubber and Fag which would confuse the living daylights out of most Americans. I mean put it this way? If you hold a rubber in your hand and want to bum a fag off someone... in the USA it's an entirely more interesting activity than standing outside with a pencil erasing device and a cigarette that you have been given.

The issue is people abroad learn BBC English. So they can't understand local accents. It's one thing to listen to the man who does the shipping forecast, it's another to listen to someone from Gloucester. 

There will always be people who are slow in your class. There will always be people who don't get it. 

My example? I couldn't understand ECG (and still for the life of me) cannot understand ECG. I can understand high end genetics, medical statistics and have a very good grasp of anatomy leading to a strength in surgery... but I struggle to put Venflon stents in. 

By your logic, I am holding back the class. By my viewpoint? All the other people need to get on my level. 

Here is the thing? I am considered as someone for whom English is a second language. I had to sit the fucking IELTS. The first language I ever spoke was English. I think in English. Why? Fucking Skin Colour. If I was called Kevin Pietersen (WHAT!!!) and white no one would go ""NAH! YOU CANNOT HAVE ENGLISH AS A FIRST LANGUAGE"". So I had to sit the damn IELTS which was fucking weird for my examiner who instead of getting someone barely scraping by had someone sit and explain to them the medical theory of children and play and how play sets them up for gender roles and learning. 

I actually disagree. Primary schools? Their job is to TEACH English. If we are going to suggest that nap time is being cut into because little Jiminder doesn't speak English as a first language then I am going to point out that you have the same issue with Dyslexics in your class. 

We work under the assumption that learning two languages is hard. Not so. Want to know something weird? Most Indians can speak 2 languages. Their ""mother tongue"" which in my case I only learned 5  years ago... and English.

Soo, on balance probably, no. some parts of the process are already a lot cheaper, other things like animal and human trials are now hideously expensive.

And the last thing the industry needs is 'slack', it's currently a bit broken in that there is little incentive to find new treatments (much less cures) for many diseases, whilst there are huge incentives to make new drugs for well understood conditions.

As to the 'shady shit', it's a hell of a lot better than it used to be, but I can't deny it's still there. Although to be fair this has always been in the commercial arms of the business rather than research. The commercial arm always wants results, the scientists always want more time.

I'm guessing you're a medical student? You're saying that you can't interpret ECGs yet you're telling other students to get on your level? And that you have a flair for surgery but struggle with venflons? In all honesty it sounds like you're hugely defensive and overestimating your own skills to compensate.

Also, taking the IETLS even though you're fluent in English doesn't sound like a bad idea - it's a test, rightly people like yourself should pass, and people who speak English less well shouldn't. If you've been brought up in a non-English speaking country or educated in a language other than English, of course you should be tested, regardless of skin colour.

Costco is great for:

* Buying in bulk - particularly meat, which is high quality and cheaper than most supermarkets, as long as you have the freezer space.
* Buying big ticket items like fridges, microwaves, power tools, shelving units. Often cheaper than online shops for better quality goods.
* Buying clothes. Non-iron cotton dress shirts are ~ £15 and comparable in quality to T M Lewin or M&amp;S. Levi jeans are ~£30.
* Freebies. They give out free samples of all sorts of things as you wander round.
* Customer service/returns policies. Basically if anything goes wrong, ever, with anything you've bought, you can take it back for a full refund. I rang to ask about a microwave I had bought three years prior, where the chrome coating was flaking, and they asked me to bring it to store and refunded me.

Costco is not so great for:

* Choice. There is typically between one and three choices for any given item. 
* Small appetites. Seriously, everything is super-size.
* Making it round the shop without having bought something.
* Making it out of the shop without buying a hot dog, ice cream or pizza slice.

We were NOT competing for world-class players up until debatably last season, potentially this season if we end up in the CL.

FSG have increased the commercial revenue, are upgrading the stadium and put far more money into signings than Hicks and Gillette ever did. All of these things will make us more attractive, and give us more spending power. I think it has to be noted just how terrible our squad was up until a couple of seasons ago.

Now we have a bunch of very talented young players, who are being brought through in the right way, playing good football, that we can be proud of. We actually have depth of squad for the first time in potentially 7-8 years.

We are still probably 4-5 world class players off having a seriously good squad but what can FSG do? They've shown they're willing to spend but if players aren't attracted to Liverpool, though some have obviously shown they are, that's not their fault.

I work for a local BBC Radio station in England. As someone else has said in the comments; the Beeb definitely do advertise internally first before externally. I got in on an apprenticeship scheme with the BBC Academy, which really isn't a bad way to attempt to get in. Though my wage is under £1000 a month, and there is college work alongside it. 

So it might not be the most viable way to get in, but it worked fine for me. The beeb does hire freelance, but in the time I've been working for them I haven't seen one around the station, we have enough people that we can manage to do everything with little issue, and then we sometimes find we have one more person than we have computers.

I'm not sure what's it like entirely for those who aren't doing a college course on the side, and have been in the position for ten years. But I can tell you getting into BBC Rado isn't the easiest thing; commercial stations (of which there are many) would be a great first stepping point. Many of the veterans in the station I'm in started off in a local commercial station.

Not to mention Lallana has been doing well, Markovic has had some good flashes of what he can do (even if he's nowhere near good enough defensively right now to be a wing-back) and Origi should be useful when he joins us this summer. Balotelli hasn't been worth £16m in my opinion, but I'm pretty sure we signed him knowing he'd be a gamble and there wasn't really any other striker looking likely to move to Anfield last summer anyway. 

When FSG took over we'd just finished 7th and had a squad that finished 6th the following season. We came 2nd last season, and even after a completely shite start to this season we've still managed to get ourselves back in a position of fighting for 4th. Until last weekend we'd been top of the PL form table for over a month, and even now we're still 3rd. 

Not to mention we've now got a very promising young squad with an average age way below any other team around us in the league, and the stadium expansion is properly underway with an actual physical thing sitting behind the main stand right now under construction. 

Some of these contract negotiations are starting to look like a bit of a shambles, but it's ridiculous to take that alone and say that FSG haven't made big leaps forward with the club when everything else is looking good. If you honestly don't think FSG have fixed a lot and done a decent job then I don't know what you were expecting short of an Arab Sheik giving us hundreds of millions for free for a few years (until FFP closed off that avenue anyway). And even with that, it's not like City are miles better off than we are right now and winning trophies left, right and centre. 

Yeah things haven't gone perfect, but go out there and find me another top club that haven't had periods where they've been pissed off with their owners in recent years. United fans hate the Glazers (also compare Sterling to the Rooney contract saga a few years back). Chelsea fans were plenty pissed with Abramovic when they were going through managers like Avram Grant and, for their own reasons, Rafa. Arsenal fans were bitching acrimoniously at their lack of spending and trophies until they bought Ozil 18 months ago. Spurs fans seem to hate Levy. City fans would probably be far more disgruntled if it wasn't for the fact that their sugar daddy owners are the only reason they're even in the top half of the table. I'd say all things considered we're doing alright with FSG, or at the very least no worse than anyone else.

I'd agree that the current model isn't ideal, but I'd say that a good deal of the reason for companies acting like this is the way patents on drugs are set up. Basically, if you're a big drug company,  you spend ~$5bn per drug that will make it to market (well over 90% fail in stage 2 or 3 trials, so that spend is spread out over lots of potential drugs). Because you need to be the first to patent the drug, you patent it before it goes out to trials. Once you do that, a 20 year countdown begins. You now have 20 years to get it through trials and sell enough to make your $5bn plus any profit you hoped to make. Trials will eat about half of this time. So there's an 8-10 year period where you desperately need to sell $5bn worth of your drug before it goes off patent and a host of generics companies come in and make it for less than you can afford to (because you employ all these researchers who design new drugs, and they don't bother).

There is no lasting benefit to having developed a drug, and that means that the companies which do R&amp;D are desperate to make that initial, in-patent profit.

There's no stress of cooking, it's comfort food, and it cheers you up. It's often the first treat I'll get when I have money again.

I don't know if I buy *less* when I'm in a better position, but I don't think I relish it as much - it's more of a spur-of-the-moment purchase than something I really, really want. I generally eat better when I'm feeling happier - and I can enjoy buying ingredients, thinking about nice food to make, and putting the effort into it. When I'm gloomy, I don't give a toss about food, and just want something easy and comforting.

My concern is that there entire schools where English isn't spoken and that the children (and parents by extension) are receiving the benefits of centuries of investment into the education system. 

These's schools would have historically been for educating British children but now the immigration situation has gotten so out of hand that we must now focus on educating foreign children with the hope that they can become productive members of our society.

The UK isn't a charity though, it's a remarkably expensive process to educate a child and there are thousands who choose to wait in Calais instead of choosing any number of countries that they have passed through.  

At the same time we need to hope that all the additional money going towards foreign born children, doesn't harm the prospects of our own and that we're not creating a society where British citizens become a smaller and smaller proportion of the population because of the demand to live in Britain.

People are very quick to dismiss this as just being xenophobic but it's a genuine concern of the people and dismissing their concerns doesn't make it just go away.

http://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2013/08/11/how-the-staggering-cost-of-inventing-new-drugs-is-shaping-the-future-of-medicine/ --&gt; Some caveats, though: drug companies have tax incentives to count costs in research and development, which could inflate the figure; they also are likely to spend extra money in order to get those medicines approved in other countries. Even more important is the fact that some R&amp;D costs come from monitoring the safety of medicines after they become hits to monitor reports of side effects.


https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/what-does-a-new-drug-cost/---&gt; A major criticism of the DiMasi paper has been that the preferential taxation provisions for R&amp;D expenses have not been factored into the analysis. Essentially, if R&amp;D costs are given preferential tax treatment, this should reduce the net cost of R&amp;D to the company. I have no particular insight into this issue other than to flag it as one that has caused controversy.


http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/fda_05.htm---&gt;
Our research has established that Phase III trials are, by far, the biggest expense, and the biggest risk, of new drug development. In fact, we have found that Phase III trials are even more expensive than is commonly thought. That expense distorts the drug-development system so that it does not efficiently and rationally allocate time and money to find new medications. Regulators block useful drugs from reaching patients. Researchers are discouraged from attempting to serve the most numerous populations of patients. And investors face the prospect of spending vast sums for nothing.

You can't build a side with 10-15 mil players and expect to challenge for top four, at least not consistently.  You might get lucky one season, as we did under Redknapp, but when even Arsene Wenger is forced to blow huge wads of cash to keep himself competitive just to qualify for UCL (with still little chance of winning a trophy), then I don't know that this should be some hardline stance.

I'm sure we could buy largely mid-value players this summer, but the squad honestly feels like it needs 1-2 world class players to take it into a truly solid side.

I'm not sure that you can take the bad luck we had in one window and somehow extrapolate that into meaning big signings are worthless.  Look at Man City... it took them a while to nail the formula even when they had all the money in the world to play with.  We obviously don't, but I think folding after one window is pessimistic.

so my favourite bit of scotland is the highlands - that whole A9 road right up from perth to inverness is an amazing drive. Halfway up it is the Highland Wildlife Park which is my favourite place in the UK, well worth a visit. Most of the roads around the highlands are awesome, but i particularly love the A9 - it has tons of parking places so you can pull over and admire the view, which I found myself doing a lot.

there's a [b&amp;b i stayed in a few years ago](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Hotel_Review-g551968-d1139087-Reviews-Drynachan_Bed_and_Breakfast-Invergarry_Scottish_Highlands_Scotland.html) i'd highly recommend which is near fort william. They only have two rooms so its a very nicely looked after experience and is run a lovely couple with a cat and a dog - well worth a look. I only stayed one night and i wish it had been more!

They'll also recommend places to go, tips on where to eat etc. The fort william area generally is good for walking and exploring. Theres a 22 mile single track road to the sea called Kinloch Huorn which is amazing - has wild deer, eagles, highland cattle etc. I got [this photo](http://ourmooncolony.co.uk/ohai.jpg) sat in my car up there a few years ago. You could spend a day walking along that track, the scenery is amazing. 

I also went over to cairngorm mountain - the whole of the Cairngorms National Park is amazing ,  but the mountain itself was a great hike up. Takes a while (iirc about 3hrs it took me each way), but worth it. The view from the top is [like this](http://ourmooncolony.co.uk/scotland2011/pano/cgm_pano.jpg).

there's also a ton of amazing waterfalls - if you see a brown tourist sign pull over and have a look! [this one](http://ourmooncolony.co.uk/scotland2011/falls/index.php?cmd=image&amp;sfpg=KklNR183ODAzLmpwZyo0YjVjYWUxZjFkZWYyZWI5Nzk4NGMwNDc0ZWRlZDNkOQ) is Bruar Falls just off the A9 near Kingussie kinda way. 


I've also spent some time in Inverness as it's a good base for the highlands , if you are at the right time of the year you can do a short drive around to the spot where [dolphins are often seen](http://www.explore-inverness.com/what-to-do/attractions/dolphin-watching-at-chanonry-point/) just north of there, which is pretty cool. 

what else, oh, Isle of Skye is amazing - if you can i'd recommend at least a day or two there, it's where one of my friends got engaged - indeed many of the islands are worth visiting if you can! 

edit : oh yeah castles - scotland has some awesome castles! I vistied [Eilean Donan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eilean_Donan) by accident! It's a pretty awesome place.

The reality is that there are a lot of problems in British society which stem mostly from overpopulation. Property markets being skewed? Overpopulation creating massive demand for homes.

Not enough nurses and doctors to go around? Overpopulation creating massive demand for healthcare. Overcrowded public transport and traffic jams on every street? Grey squirrels.

To be honest, I disagree with Farage on a lot of things (almost everything, in fact), but to suggest that no-limit immigration is a good idea is moronic. No reason we shouldn't be more strict about who comes in. It's not about cultural or ethnic superiority. It's not about winning the lottery of life and telling the losers to suck it.

It's not AFAICT actually illegal to deliberately contradict implicit terms on the contract so landlords can try to con you with little risk, but it *is* a con and doesn't change the implicit terms.

Pretty sure the 24 hours notice (except for emergencies such as access to fix a gas leak) is an implicit term, but always check these things with people who know (Shelter, Citizens Advice).

Also remember - the devil you know is usually better than the devil from a letting agent. Decide what you're willing to accept just to stay nice with the landlord, and tell him if you think he's overstepped that. Personally I wouldn't be happy with my landlord letting himself in without notice, but it doesn't bother me that he comes around occasionally so long as he knocks on the door.

- Landlord must ask (and receive) the tenant’s permission before entering the premises.

You *may* even have the right to change locks, but I'd wait on that...  (edit - verify with Shelter/CAB before doing this as another person said you may need to provide a key, making it pointless)

Then the price of administration for companies would increase due to the increased numbers in the workforce meaning more people to manage, maintain and monitor.

For example, reading through a revision guide gets boring very quickly, in my opinion. You'll remember how boring it is and not want to do it the next day. Additionally, there is a high chance that you won't remember anything by the next day. When it comes to the night before the exam, you may realise that you don't know much of the syllabus.  
I am astonished at the amount of people that do it this way. Yes, it could work for some people, but for the majority, this isn't the most *efficient* use of your time. Considering that most people cannot work constantly for 17+ hours each day, efficiency when studying is key.

My advice that I like to give is to make notes on the modules/parts of the exam, from a revision guide or revision website (like BBC Bitesize) for your exam board. It doesn't work for everyone, but I've found it highly effective. Make them as concise as possible and use bullet points or simple mind maps. I also advise hand writing them, although you can type them up later if you prefer. [Here](http://jameswalker.net/GCSE/science/biology/B1.php) are mine, for example.  
Making notes and summarising is a great way to learn exactly what each module comprises of, and writing it will help you remember it. Writing notes for a whole GCSE will take 3-6 hours.  
Once this is done, you should have under 10 pages of content to read to learn **everything** you will be asked in the exams. If you learn it all, you will probably get A or A* (if it's a higher paper). I learn the content by reading through the pages several times, especially the morning before the exam. Personally, I find that I can memorise 5 pages of A4 in an hour. 

Another great method is doing past papers. It's a lot more 'entertaining' and it really helps. Plus, you are likely to finish it once you start, that's 1 hour + of revision!

You can struggle with different parts of medicine. It's a monsterous field. I know people who can do all those things but can't put stitches in. You have an aptitude within this field for different things. You cannot master everything. 

I was educated in English. All of my education EVERYWHERE was in English. I speak ""other"" languages due to travelling the world but English was my first language. My patients may not speak English but my lecturers did. 

And if we are going to bring that up then most doctors who live in Newcastle or who have deep Irish accents should be banned from practice. Come on we know there are accents in the UK that are terribly hard to understand even for us. And that local slang changes so much that even in the UK we struggle to keep up with it. So why are we expecting foreigners to suddenly be experts in slang we can't manage.

null,false,stanley_stinwick,eng-westmidlands,Birmingham,null,"Embarrassingly, I spend a lot of time thinking about this, so apologies if this post is over-long. I think that the reason you don't see much good pizza in the UK is because of demand problems rather than supply problems. I'm not sure that people here prefer 'good' or artisan pizza to the conveyor oven kebab style stuff. 

We see this in cities where there's easy access to both kinds of pizza. Birmingham's Bullring provides a convenient case for us to look at. You have a Pizza Hut within spitting distance of Rossopomodoro. Rossopomodoro does a really great Neapolitan style pizza for around eight quid, which is much cheaper than the comparable pizza at Pizza Hut. Despite this, Pizza Hut is really busy, and although Rossopomodoro does well they don't do the same amount of trade. That is to say that people are effectively paying a premium not to eat the 'good' pizza.

It's true that Rossopomodoro looks like kind of an expensive restaurant from outside, especially as it's in Selfridges. I can see that the *perception* that it's an expensive place might dissuade people, but I think a more likely explanation is that people just prefer the pizza at Pizza Hut.

Another potentially equally likely explanation is that people are relatively conservative with regards to choosing places to eat at. I think there are two ways to make sense of this. The first is that trying a new restaurant is a gamble, so although a new artisan pizza place might seem nice, people might not want to take the risk. The second is that all chains have a milder version of the sort of aura that places like Nando's have. The pizza at Pizza Hut might be only part of the experience. It could be the case that Pizza Hut have crafted an experience that is enjoyable for reasons other than the food, or that people want to engage in the cultural practice of 'going to Pizza Hut' in the same way that people 'go for a Nando's'.

You also say you have never felt as if you have lagged behind. That's great, but some people do purely down to language issues. The people on my course I referred to are intelligent, and are only here having been high academic acheivers in their home country and they openly admit they struggle having to interpet things from English and need it explained as simple as possible, and that takes a lot of time, hence the problem.

And if you're making it non-retractable then clearly the amount that has to be paid from taxes is going to increase to cover the difference. You're not going to have those people who are rejected benefits lowering the total amount that's paid out each year. So that's going to require more taxes. 

Then you're going to have less people paying tax because those who are working enough overtime to break into the first tax bracket are suddenly going to be earning much less than the tax bracket and may actually need to be paid money to being them up to the living income. That's going to have to be paid for by the, now fewer, people remaining above the tax bracket. Those people who are not only being asked to pay more taxes but pay more for goods due to the increased business costs I talked about in my last post.

And owning homes doesn't really factor into what you're discussing. I've never met anyone on benefits who has every thought about anything other than renting a house.

What I do know is that the business school is well respected - in terms of a comparison between Heriot Watt I have no idea you'll have to look that up yourself - I was a philosophy student and the Phil department at Leeds is really highly regarded nationally. Have a look at the department stats and see what you make of them. 

In the end what many have said on here is true, often the courses are very similar between universities and the defining factor is everything else. Which city do you want to be in more? Sounds like your heart's set on Edinburgh. If that's the case then go for it - personally I like more modern cities but that's just me. It's really a personal preference sort of situation at this point. In my opinion the night-life in Leeds is unparalleled apart from the larger Manchester across the Pennines, the food's good and there are some terrific restaurants and little gems dotted around the city for you to find. I've not spent much time in Edinburgh myself so I can't really pass judgement fairly really, but I love living in Yorkshire. 

What I will say is that historically Leeds has the pedigree in terms of education - although the league tables may not show that now, many from an older generation will view a degree from a red-brick/Russell Group such as Leeds as more prestigious than a degree from a former polytechnic. And to be frank, often these are the people who are CEOs/directors at companies who will be offering you a job after you've finished. 

This is probably part of the reason you're getting a load of mixed messages here - often the old polytechnics are actually seriously good universities these days in terms of results (sometimes even better than the more 'prestigious' universities) but are hampered by this view that they are somehow inferior because they used to be polys. Historic prejudice I suppose - hence why I'd recommend just going with the city you like the best.

I imagine the 'poshness' factor played a part, and the fact Pizza Hut has a huge advertising budget to bombard people with their name. 

There's an independent pizza place in my home town called Ginos and I think it has such a good reputation at this point that a dominos could move in next door and not stand a chance. 

They're also quality and cheap. 

I think the biggest hurdle is getting your brand out there. So in terms of if I were to start up a place, I'd probably make it look cheap and nasty but make the best pizza. And I don't really mean Neapolitan when I say best pizza. That kind of pizza probably isn't to a lot of peoples tastes.

The Criminal Justice Act 1988 (Section.139) bans the carrying of bladed articles in public without good reason.

It then provides an exemption for folding knives shorter than 3"", accepting that they are commonly used as a ""generally useful tool"".

The case of *Harris v. DPP (1992)* held that a knife with a locking blade was equivalent to a fixed blade. Because, well, *it is*. That case went to Crown Court and therefore constitutes case law. It does also sweep up a few rather silly things like Stanley knives and short Gerbers, which are clearly of limited utility for stabbing.
