I think if Corbyn is to have a chance of winning, his supporters will have to galvanise opinion behind a more caring choice than is perceived around the current Tory policy.

It's not that people who are caring can't support other parties, it's more that it seems to me his winning strategy is to put forward a caring opposition to the current hard austerity.

i.e. his strategy shouldn't be to suggest he'll make us more secure or that he'll do better with the economy, I think his best strategy will be to look acceptable on those things and compete with the Tories on policies that show caring to others. It's his best selling point in my opinion, and I think it might just resonate with the public.

edit, I think I'll add another point, too, which is separate from the above, and that gets more to the heart of your question.

I think it is possible for a Tory supporter to believe that austerity is more caring in the long run because a country that lives within its means is better for all the people in it.

I also believe it's defensible to say these people are deluded. Not because it isn't caring to take the long view, but because austerity is generally considered a failed economic policy amongst economists, in the sense it cripples the economy more than other types of policy.

null,null,djimonia,lfc99,,null,"My thoughts on this:

1. We're not playing a false 9. I meant that Guardiola did that but now Barcelona have evolved to add more penetration by playing a more classic 4-3-3 with Suarez as a forward. His work-rate and Messi and Neymar's runs mean that they have lots of penetration now. Players like Iniesta and Rakitic can look for them in spaces. Benteke will play where Suarez/Sturridge played in 13/14 as soon as he is fit - right up front. He will harry the back line, hold the ball to support the transition from defence to midfield to attack, and score lots of goals using his skill, speed, strength. He can play the target man but because he can score goals he's going to do that as he pleases and that is terrifying. Suarez was terrifying because he ran like Tevez used to - but he could also score any kind of goal (headers, volleys, placed shots, tap-ins, scrappy ones, weak footed) and that was a nightmare to deal with.  Benteke has that quality so he will complement Sturridge well when the latter returns. We will probably play 4-3-3 (Firmino, Benteke, Ibe/Lallana/Coutinho) and 4-4-2 Diamond (with Firmino, Origi or Ings alongside Benteke) until then. In the 4-3-3, Coutinho will either play at the top of the midfield 3 or on either side of the front 3 but he will definitely start!

2. Absolutely. I've added this in because it is a point I wanted to make and completely forgot to mention! I don't think we will return to that model. Gerrard had world class passing range and that cannot be replaced easily. What we have done is bring in someone experienced (Milner) who can both run and pass (like Henderson) - meaning our midfield 2 can sit deep, protect the back 4 and change roles as needed during the game (e.g. sitting deep to form the back 6, making runs forward to support attack and try to overload the opposition, pressing the midfield to buy time when an attack breaks down). I haven't seen enough because we haven't played a game with all our squad to choose from yet. It will be a few weeks and the season will have already started before everyone is match fit. Right now though, yes, I believe we have more verticality just on the basis of who we've signed. What I am less sure of, is whether our low block has been improved. Stoke away next week should help us figure that out!

I met him on a train in West Africa. He had spent years working on the dutch railways, from driving trains up into management before he retired.  In his dotage, he was wandering around Africa getting rides on all the old steam stock that was sold off in the '60s from Europe.  He had visited massive scrap yards in Nigeria, talked his way into driving a train in Cameroon and had adventure after adventure riding the African rail roads.  He was living his dream.  

The thing that struck me the most about this guy was his pure, unadulterated passion for trains. If 99% of the people I meet every day had a similar amount of of passion for something, anything, the world would be a better place.  Instead most people are content to trade their dreams with promises of pieces of silver and a mortgage, suffocating in suburbia in front of the telly whist their energy slowly saps away between trips to the pub.

Trains aren't my thing - but don't knock people who do enjoy them.

So a nationalised rail or energy firm would need to be a viable business in its own right (as opposed to a rescue job, like the old mines), but otherwise it's fine.

Not an expert though.

https://www.tssa.org.uk/en/whats-new/news/index.cfm/are-eu-rules-really-a-barrier-to-reuniting-the-railways-under-public-control

Long story short, there's no reason that rail passenger and freight  services can't be provided by state-owned operators, as long as the government still gives other companies an opportunity to get involved on an equal footing. Again not an expert, but allowing private companies to run Open Access services should fulfill this.

So you think the general public will make that comparison and hold prejudice against any politician who is married or living with a Mexican woman as they might be a closet Trotskyist.

This is as farcical as demonising a vegetarian because Hitler was a vegetarian.

&gt;Nick Clegg is married to a Spanish Woman.

So?

You think the general public are prejudiced against Spanish women?

&gt;Galloway is a serial divorcee and last we heard was married to a Muslim.

Galloway is considered a prize clown for every reason other than his marital and extra-marital activities.

&gt;Immigration is no trivial matter, no marginal issue. It's pivotal to them. It affects jobs, schools, housing, healthcare, crime, social cohesion, etc etc. 

I did not say that it was not. What left-wing policies of recent years, except perhaps excluding immigration, do you think Labour ostracized their northern base support?

&gt;Because it's not an issue that matters much to the public.

This is absurd. Apparently Yvette Cooper's husband is irrelevant to the public but that Corbyn is married to a Mexican would be because obviously that means he's a Trotskyist.

York is a nicer place to live, but Birmingham isn't really that bad. Living cost I imagine is similar in both cities. Employability is probably about the same. Reputation is similar.

Bare in mind when people recomend one over the other, everybody has their own personal experiences at uni. Generally speaking however, here's a short comparison.

York:
Quaint, nice city in the north of England. Not much crime, quite a lot of student jobs, not a lot of nightlife, near the coast. University is a campus based uni, and is quiet nice. Lots of history. Relatively small city in the countryside. 

Birmingham:
England's 'second city'. Quite a large vibrant industrial city. Also a campus based uni, the campus is quite grand. Located in the middle of England, lots of student jobs.

null,null,woocheese,null,null,null,"Depends what role but here is why I never would and never did.

I know not all roles are direct combat roles but the core roll of the army is combat.

Taking a life is something that shouldn't come lightly. Working as a police officer I am aware I may well find myself in a position where I may need to defend myself or another from harm and that may involve hurting someone maybe even killing them. 

However those decisions are mine. I will respond to the job, I will decide how to act, I will decide what I do, I do and will do what I see is necessary to protect myself and others. I make the decision.

The issue I have with the army is I would be ordered to act. My government would deploy me to fight in a country I personally may have no concerns about for reasons I may find unjust. My commanders may send me to attack a location in the country where I will find myself in combat with other soldiers. I could be sent on the offensive. I may be killed by them or kill them and in the heat of the moment I know my decisions at the time would still be mine, but the circumstances putting me in that kill or be killed situation would not be something I decided. It would be the result of someone else's orders, someone else's decisions and not my own.

""Ours is not to reason why, ours is to do or die."" That's a mind set I couldn't grasp. 

I don't trust my government enough to allow them to direct me to engage in mortal combat. That's the bottom line really. 

I'm not a pacifist either, sometimes war is necessary, but I don't trust the leadership enough for them to tell me where to go or who to fight. War is war, it will always be brutal no matter what laws and language people use. The civilians and soldiers are the ones who pay the highest price in war. Neither are well looked after when their lives are ruined after the dust settles.

Ain't down with it.

Well guess what, the tabloids are farcical. And a sandal-wearing vegetarian weirdo is a sure vote loser too. Someone who's good at chess on the continent is admired; in Britain it's considered ""sad"". Heck, even someone who's good at math is considered ""sad"" or ""weird"" or ""creepy"". The British public isn't too fond of nerds. 

&gt; You think the general public are prejudiced against Spanish women?

The public isn't fond of cosmopolitan, internationalist men with exotic foreign brides when it comes to politics, especially with immigration being a hot topic. 

&gt; Galloway is considered a prize clown for every reason other than his marital and extra-marital activities.

So will Corbyn be made one. 

&gt; What left-wing policies of recent years,

What left-wing policies of recent years... lemme think... wait, I can't think of any left-wing policies of recent years either good or bad... nor do I even care to... and guess what, nor will the public! 

The general electorate, generally speaking, doesn't keep a tab on left-wing policies. They don't need to. They don't care. Either they like the proposed PM or they dont'. And the general state of things come election day. 

&gt; This is absurd. Apparently Yvette Cooper's husband is irrelevant to the public but that Corbyn is married to a Mexican would be because obviously that means he's a Trotskyist.

It's not absurd, it's just that a far left london liberal being a cosmopolitan geezer married to an exotic young groupie is a liability; he'll be seen as pervy and a manipulator and removed from the daily life of people in this country. A Northern female MP being married to a buffoon isn't a liability to her. That's the lot of many a successful woman. If anything she'll be seen as a good, faithful, loyal wife for sticking with him despite his shortcomings.

null,null,suzych,null,null,null,"First, so glad you took good advice and watched the rest of S8!  

And you're right: big issues were left unresolved by the 2-part ending of S8 plus the Xmas special -- which is why I think of S8 and S8 as the two wings of a hinge.  One wing of the hinge is S8, in which the TARDIS team fights and wobbles its way to finding solid footing again after a major, wrenching regeneration: Clara flips from ""Impossible Girl"" in love with 11 to regular woman who's been baited with Smith and switched to a completely different and much more difficult Doctor.  She's mad as hell (wouldn't you be?) as well as scared, and he's plain mad and flailing for balance and clarity.  So wing A is them re-establishing their relationship on a new footing between fresh versions of themselves.  What we've been led to expect of wing B (S9) is this newly rebonded pair flying off to adventure.  The turning point, or the barrel of the hinge that holds wings A and B together, is ""Last Xmas"". 

Either LXmas is itself a nest of dreams being peeled down to reality, or it's ""reality"" being revealed as literally a dream tangle that didn't 
happen (or a mixture of both).  I'm going with LXmas as sufficiently ""real"" to have re-made the bond between Doctor and Companion so they can dash into new adventures with their conflicts of S8 resolved -- except for whatever sinister shadow is, we're told, ""stalking"" the Doctor, which should become clear as we move through S9.

But if most or all of LXmas was dreams, S9 takes off from the end of DiH (or even earlier), with the two still separated and the resolution and re-connection of the Doctor and Clara still to be accomplished.  This is why I'm betting that LXmas was real, so we don't have to go through another version of the S8 finale + LXmas. Well, that and the S9 trailer, which sure looks like high adventure with monsters and aliens to me, not more of the soul-searching of S8.  

You're not missing anything -- you're right.  LXmas wasn't intended to make sense in the way you mean.  IMO, things were quite *deliberately* left unclear in order to keep us busy speculating about all this during the long, long wait for S9.

As to the Doctor letting Missy die, that's for S9 to answer.  I think from watching the scene that it was about what he decided to do being thwarted (but done anyway) by either a prepared plan of Missy's or a spontaneous action by the Cyber-Brig. 

As for the orange -- I see the slow reveal at the very end of LXmas as the visual reply to the Doctor's exclamation as he prepares to follow Clara into the TARDIS: he never gets second chances but here one is, and ""I don't even know who to thank!"" = this happy ""ending"" is his gift to him and to Clara from -- Santa, of course!  

But is it a real or a dream-world gift?  Only S9 can tell us that . . . Hurry, September!

&gt;The Cup Trust is a registered charity. It has a corporate trustee called Mountstar PVC which is resident in the British Virgin Islands. It borrowed money with which it purchased bonds. It sold the bonds to rich individuals at a price well below market value. The individuals sold the bonds at market value and donated the proceeds to the Cup Trust. Those individuals may be entitled to claim gift aid relief on their donations. Under the gift aid rules, the Cup Trust would, in the normal course, be entitled to claim back the basic rate tax paid by the donors on those gifts.

Um, did you see my previous comment in which I agreed that UKIP are not Nazis?  

&gt;In the same way, Labour has Marxists but as a whole the party isn't going to call for the killing of landlords and the bourgeois.

I agree with this too.  I don't think Corbyn is an authoritarian who's going to introduce a Gulag system.  In fact, I'm sure he's a genuinely nice guy - who has antiquated and nutty political views.

However...

I think that there *should* be concerns about the far-left getting any power.  I'm not so much concerned about Corbyn, as I am about the ideologues who are going to ride in on his coat-tails.  

I'm concerned about any attempts by Communist sympathizers to stage a come-back into mainstream politics.

But, I think, not going to be compared to Hitler somehow.

&gt;The public isn't fond of cosmopolitan, internationalist men with exotic foreign brides when it comes to politics, especially with immigration being a hot topic. 

Yet I've see no indication whatsoever that Nick Clegg was disliked because of that.

Your characterisation of the British public, whilst I don't think we'll win any awards, is laughable. The Idiocracy that you envision is arguably not worth being elected into and if you were to try, worth putting up someone who might change something.

&gt;So will Corbyn be made one. 

Yet not for his affairs.

&gt;What left-wing policies of recent years... lemme think... wait, I can't think of any left-wing policies of recent years either good or bad... nor do I even care to... and guess what, nor will the public! 

So when you said ""Labour lost support in the north by lurching to the left"" you in fact, were talking nonsense. I bought up the only feasible example - that of immigration and even on that Labour did not lurch to the left - they just didn't pick up the public position on immigration well enough and poorly tried to lurch right to salvage it (but not right enough). All parties excluding UKIP suffered over their immigration policy.

&gt;It's not absurd, it's just that a far left london liberal being a cosmopolitan geezer married to an exotic young groupie is a liability; he'll be seen as pervy and a manipulator and removed from the daily life of people in this country. A Northern female MP being married to a buffoon isn't a liability to her. That's the lot of many a successful woman. If anything she'll be seen as a good, faithful, loyal wife for sticking with him despite his shortcomings.

perhaps he does need consistent game time to fully develop as we want him too but hopefully that will come as the years go, for now he will have to make due with the opportunities given to him. 

If you just type in ""joe gomez vs"" into the search bar and look for full videos (not just highlights), you will see that he does indeed make mistakes, ones that could be capitalized upon in the PL. [his game vs Brisbane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXuGKMglpQ) showed that he still has improvements to make and areas to improve on (mainly his passing in the defensive third). It's not as if I do not rate gomez. I think he is a good player albeit very raw. you can see he often depends on his physicality which may not be as reliable in the PL as compared to these weaker and smaller oppositions. I know everyone loves to get on the hype train and for good reason, but i think gomez will need a year or two. He certainly shouldnt be touted as a moreno replacement but as an emergency back up for him.  he can pressure moreno as well because he has shown his quality when he has been given the chance, but he shouldnt be thought of as a long term left back solution. like you said left back isnt even his natural role. ideally we will see him in his natural center back role after skrtel hangs up his boots.

But if we only voted when we're an expert on policy then not many of us would get to vote.

But to try and answer your question. I'm not a fan of the European court of human rights. I feel the UK has a good track record on Human Rights and can manage it ourselves. I believe that if we have the need to remove someone from our country, we can make that choise within our own borders. 
Free movment of people seems a little unballenced and I would like to see the UK able to control the number of EU citizens that enter the country, especially when those coming in just create more competition in a particular labour market to the point of wage compression - I'm not against free movment of people completely but just enough to ballence to be fair on the countries gaining and losing workers.

I would like to see the EU (for the UK) to be more trade focused where we can create trade deals with other nations outside the EU without EU permission or input (although I accept some EU rules might need to apply due to safety as some good/services can impact on the rest of the EU countries)

How does that make it any less moral or justifiable to kill them?

You are right in some ways that the populous was not convinced by our attempts - because we were often ignored, marginalised and dismissed by those who did not share our opinion.
You say that 9/11 had nothing to do with the invasion of Iraq and say I mis interpret what you are getting at.
Why then did you bring 911 up in your argument if it is unrelated? Are you saying that it was an arbitrary mention that could have been replaced with ""since the introduction of mobile phones"" ... Or ""since the Millenium""?
.... I doubt it. 
You used 911 in your argument because you know that it was used as a pretext to invade Iraq at the time of the Iraq invasion.
It was not an arbitrary statement.
As a protester from all those years ago, I feel it my duty to point out the flawed aspect of this argument by asking the question, especially if you are opining on the wisdom of the crowd....

Where did the crowd come to this conclusion? .... From the mouths of the politicians leading the charge - from the media prostituting themselves on behalf of them.

Whilst you point out that perhaps a great number of the populous was behind the war, those of us who were not part of that group are still here, watching.... And personally when I see the same tired connections being made to justify the Iraq invasion ( ie 911 ), 
Forgive me but I am compelled to point it out.

Nothing personal.

&gt; I'm not a fan of the European court of human rights. I feel the UK has a good track record on Human Rights and can manage it ourselves. I believe that if we have the need to remove someone from our country, we can make that choise within our own borders.

Ok fair enough, but I see this is about control. Now Human rights is hard issue, because I personally think that no government should be allowed to interfere with a case. The fact is our government does interfere. The reason the court of Human rights works is that it protects us from the government from doing that. now 9/10 the government normally wins, its only been the few cases the government loses that we ever hear about it. 

&gt; ment of people seems a little unballenced and I would like to see the UK able to control the number of EU citizens that enter the country, especially when those coming in just create more competition in a particular labour market to the point of wage compression. 

Well wage compression according to national statistics in the previous year, wage compression was only 0.5% so its very tiny. It is also something that could be easily solved by raising the minimum wage. I don't really think we can stop competition in a globalised world. 

Also you say its unbalanced but a lot of countries like Spain rely on British workers and pensioners to move there. 

 &gt; I would like to see the EU (for the UK) to be more trade focused where we can create trade deals with other nations outside the EU without EU permission or input 

But not many countries want just us, they want the EU. Its alright trying to trade with one country but, the USA, Canada they want to trade with all the EU not just us. 

&gt; I would like to see EU change for the UK.

If people want to *win* elections, they should vote with their heads.

I suspect though that just like many people are shy Tories, there are many shy Europeans, afraid of having their opinions shouted down by the sun, the mail the telegraph (sponsored by HSBC) and their acolytes.

&gt; When a man goes out to go in, the men who are out try to get him out, and when he is out he goes in and the next man in goes out and goes in. There are two men called umpires who stay all out all the time and they decide when the men who are in are out.

- ""Stoke City"" has made a formal offer, but Igor Mikhailovich considered it necessary to reject it. That is his right.

- **You would be interested in playing for ""Stoke City""?**

- Yes, why not? It's the championship of England, every game is interesting. Do not worry, I have another year of contract - I have it in good faith to work, and only then will look for alternatives.

- **It turns out that you fit the team that did not play in the European Cup?**

- I believe that the change of the Ukrainian championship on the English Premier League - a step forward. I have ambitions, I want to play in the top clubs, but if these suggestions do not have ... I weigh the ""pros"" and ""cons"": in this variant has its disadvantages, but ... it is nice to play when every week the stadium is coming 50 thousand, and not 5 ... When you play with ""Manchester United"", ""Chelsea"", ""Arsenal"", ""Tottenham"" and ""Liverpool"", that will only continue to grow, to move forward.

- **You are aware that you will be hard to leave after the departure of Lance?**

- I had an agreement with the president, but he decided not to let go of me. I repeat: I am a professional, so I will fulfill his contract until the end.

- **Most will not renew the contract with ""Dynamo""?**

- I believe that it makes no sense to go somewhere 27-28 years. Last summer I said Igor, that sign his last contract with ""Dynamo"". I prolonged the agreement with his club that he could get compensation for what made me who I am today. Igor Mikhailovich did not want to take money - I can not make him do it.

- **Igor Mikhailovich you explain your decision?**

- He said, ""Stoke City"" - not my level. Talk to the president, asked his opinion ... Maybe it is something you specifically tell. Now talking about my position: I was doing nicely for the club, all openly told the press. There is a proposal, but the president does not want to let me go, so I have fulfilled my contract.

- **""Stoke City"" does not give up on your transfer?**

- This offer still stands.

- **Do you have any other options?**

- Nothing concrete there. But nothing, I will have to wait - until the end of the transfer window a month.

- **With England someone came to talk with you?**

- (Laughs). I've already told you enough. ",null,0,null,1438546594,null,null,1438599178,0,ctp62pz,null,t3_3fja80,null,null,null,t3_3fja80,null,null,null,1440240979,null,11,null,coys,t5_2ryq7,11,null

Conservative voters (who obviously would vote Conservative) did not dislike Nick Clegg and the Liberal Democrats, everyone else did. Lib Dems base evaporated away when they began working and propping up a Conservative government.

Pretty much.

In general bookies may restrict your account if they think you're being cheeky and ""not playing fair"" i.e. not giving them your money 'like what you're supposed to with gambling'. Generally this applies to people who are arbitrary betting or ""arbing"": this is sort of related to matched betting but is slightly more difficult/time consuming. The large sums of money involved mean that bookies can more easily spot when it's happening. With matched betting it isn't really so obvious, and certainly not for small time betters like myself.

Personally I only had one account restricted to only being allowed to bet on ""starting price"" odds for horse racing. Being a little naive/ignorant of this particular bookie, I hadn't realised that that was what I was doing and so my matched bet sort of failed. As it happens though I won my follow up bet with the bookie on a fixed odds race, so as far as they were concerned I'd won over £1000 from them. In the end I actually lost a bit of money due to how matched betting works (I paid out elsewhere) but they weren't to know that.

This group is called Progress. It acts like a party-within-a-party inside Labour, backing individual candidates and policies. It is rarely talked about in the national press, but is a big influence in the Labour Party.

Progress runs on £260,000-a-year funding from Lord Sainsbury. He used to fund the Labour Party directly, giving over £6.3 million between 2005 and 2010, but he stopped funding Labour when Ed Miliband got elected. Angry at Miliband’s fairly timid shuffle to the left, Sainsbury went on a rich man’s strike.

He didn’t just take his money and go home. Instead of funding Labour, he now funds Progress, whose job is to keep Labour Blairite or centrist, whatever you want to call it. Progress’s income since 2010 is about £1.5m.

Progress, through its website, its weekend school, its meetings at Labour’s conference and its activist network push the candidates and policies Sainsbury likes.

He is unsurprisingly against Labour actually challenging power, wealth and privilege, or giving any real power to the kind of low-paid people who work in his family supermarket. He's of course also against any attempts to close corporate tax loopholes, or even raise rates.

At the Progress rally at the last Labour conference, Tristram Hunt was one of the speakers, where he declared he was “delighted to be with Progress” because “you might be an unaccountable faction dominated by a secretive billionaire, but you are OUR unaccountable faction dominated by a secretive billionaire.” It was a sort of joke, but many a true word is spoken in jest.

Hunt is a particular Sainsbury favourite — he was in fact Lord Sainsbury’s personal spokesman before he became a Labour MP.

Hunt was working for Sainsbury when Progress was formed out of the money left over from the original campaign to make Tony Blair leader of the party. Sainsbury originally got Derek Draper to run Progress. He soon disgraced himself and Labour by claiming he could get influence with the New Labour government for corporate lobbyists.

Despite this early link to a lobbying scandal, Progress still relies on money and contacts from lobbyists, alongside Sainsbury’s cash. In fairness, Progress is more open about its income than it used to be. Its website advises that in 2014 it relied on money and support from Bellenden Public Affairs, a lobbying firm that represents privatisers like Serco and NHS outsourcing contractor, Care UK.

Progress also takes money from Lexington, another lobbying firm whose clients include Interserve, another major privatisation contractor, and Goldman Sachs. The City of London Corporation put some cash into the Progress operation as well.

At the forthcoming Labour conference you could go and see a Progress meeting with Chris Leslie MP, shadow chancellor of the exchequer — and a prominent Progress member. The meeting is funded by the British Venture Capital Association (BVCA). It is the lobby group for private equity investors who are keen to privatise the NHS, as companies they have interests in, are likely to get fat NHS contracts.

A BVCA paper on the NHS said its members would make money from “a trend towards outsourcing (to independent sector providers) of publicly funded healthcare.” BVCA has been funding Progress meetings for some years.

At the same forthcoming Labour conference you could go and see shadow culture secretary Chris Bryant speaking at a meeting funded by mobile phone firm Talk Talk and shadow energy minister Caroline Flint speaking on a meeting funded by Hitachi, which is deeply involved in our heavily subsidised nuclear power programme.

Progress is deeply committed to pro-privatisation and pro-corporate policies. It has also campaigned to reduce trade union influence in the Labour Party. Progress’s official position in the forthcoming Labour elections is to support Liz Kendall for Labour leader and Tessa Jowell for mayor of London.

Progress could not pick a candidate for deputy leader — which in fact shows how deeply Progress is embedded in the parliamentary party.

Three deputy leader candidates — Caroline Flint, Ben Bradshaw and Stella Creasy — are all Progress members, so they couldn’t choose which one to back.

Burnham was also a prominent Progress member. However, when he was health secretary in 2010 he tried to shift away from his former Blairite plan to increase privatisation in the NHS. This enraged Progress, which published articles attacking Burnham’s plan to make the NHS the “preferred provider” for NHS services over private contractors. It said Burnham’s pro-NHS stance was a “nightmare” and attacked his “anti-market rhetoric on health.”

So Progress is spending a lot of time “warning” Burnham and Yvette Cooper not to be pulled leftward. Progress director Richard Angell is arguing that “Burnham and Cooper’s early opposition to cuts and vague commitments to reverse other measures does not bode well” and that “Burnham and Cooper flip-flop on welfare” because they did not back Harriet Harman’s decision to accept welfare cuts as fully as they should. This makes them, in Progress’s view, in danger of being “Corbyn-lite.”

Progress’s attempts to shift the party towards privatisation and other business-friendly policies favoured by their funders aren’t hard to find. But they don’t get reported that much because most journalists both rely on Progress members for their stories and agree with their Blairite arguments.

This is why there has only been reporting, over and over again, of some Labour grandee or Blairite foretelling disaster if Jeremy wins. Blair himself is a part of progress, so it is no surprise he was quick to try and intervene.

Second, relying exclusively on transfer fees ignores strategies that are designed to circumvent them. Most of Liverpool's best players do not reflect their transfer market prices, because we buy players early and took advantage of some frees. The £XI based on transfer fees is really sloppy. Sterling cost £600k, but his value is closer to the £49 City paid. To really estimate the value of the players on the field, there should be an ""actuarial £XI,"" based on transfer market estimates.

And whether you like it or not, in some of the rough loyalist areas of Belfast racism is commonplace. 

You miss the point.

Someone was not being racially discriminated againt. They made up a transparent lie, and it was upvoted massively. People who pointed out that it was obviously a lie were downvoted heavily. It was upvoted because wanted it to be true. Obvious bollocks about loyalists driving round waving flags spitting on brown looking people - probably has never happened, never mind several times to the same person, and yet it's upvoted on here because it fits the narrative.

It depends what you mean by commonplace. Yes, racism exists in parts of Belfast, but it's no more racist here than in, for example, Scotland, and slightly less racist than England. There shouldn't be any racism at all, of course, but it only takes one group of idiots to burn out a nail salon to outweight the scores who would turn up and show solidarity. East Belfast gets a hard time on here, where it's portrayed as some sort of third-world ghetto. Put something on r/northernireland slagging the east for being a racist shitehole, and you're sitting on a karma mine. And yet, while there are problems with racism here, members of (for example) the Polish community are massively overrepresented in east Belfast. They choose to live here.

It was racial discrimination IIRC. And I also commented in that post about a black friend of mine getting beat up by a bunch of smicks, one of which was wearing a rangers top, so I assume they were loyalists. You can't prove it wasn't true like. It wouldn't surprise me one bit.

Definitely not true. The culture of discrimination and targeting minorities is more present in NI than anywhere else in the UK, maybe even western Europe. I believe loyalists are the main issue here. And now that the whole sectarian thing has lost steam, they are targeting gays and foreigners to fill the void.

I add 'mass' because in my opinion averaging slightly over a quarter of a million people coming into this country per year is mass. Especially when before new Labour immigration per annum was only a fraction of that.  

I think that whatever government is in power needs to have control as to where abouts in the UK immigrants are allowed to settle.

I don't know if I wasn't clear enough, or you're being obtuse. It isn't a question of semantics, of what does or not qualify as racial discrimination. It's a question of whether it actually happened, which it's pretty clear that it didn't. 

Well, no, I can't prove that lots of things aren't true. Still, when someone says something too ridiculous to be true, promises to come back and corroborate their story, and you still claim not be surprised if it was actually true, you rather prove my point. 

&gt;Definitely not true. The culture of discrimination and targeting minorities is more present in NI than anywhere else in the UK, maybe even western Europe. I believe loyalists are the main issue here. And now that the whole sectarian thing has lost steam, they are targeting gays and foreigners to fill the void. 

Except hate crime statistics per head of population are slightly lower here than in England and Wales. 

&gt;You seem to think I'm generalising NI. I'm not. I am talking about a very specific group of people that is pretty much universally despised by everyone in NI.

I don't know anyone who seriously like fleg waving loyalists. My point (and what originally prompted me to reply to your comment) was your question of whether this sub has a nationalist majority.

To me the current immigration policy seems chaotic and destructive. Allowing huge numbers of people to descend on select areas, drastically changing those areas against the wishes of the locals whilst leaving other parts of the country completely untouched. 

I don't think it's government policy to dictate where, geographically, immigrants buy property or start families, so I think the underlying problem is with the location of cheap property and that immigrants would be drawn to areas with cheaper rates of rent, which would explain why some areas are seemingly untouched by immigration, solution would be to increase the quality of affordable housing and temper the rental market

Even if we wanted to stop immigration, EU's free movement would mean our only option would cutting down on non EU immigration and asylum seekers, which has been going on for a while to no avail.

If you have changed the oil fairly recently or do so and still have issues, maybe consider getting it checked. Could be something simple (hopefully) like a damaged or leaking exhaust section, or it could be a bit more complicated and involve the engine block, hopefully neither though!

EDIT: thought I would mention as well with a general service you will want to replace the air filter, oil filter, oil, pollen filter(if you have one) spark plugs, and anything else that is recommended for your golf (check online, I found useful guides for each part of the service for my hyundai online).

If you accept 1 and don't get 2, then you have your back up. If you accept 1 and get offered 2 as well, (fantastic!) weigh up pros and cons and figure out best fit.

So I took (1), which is in recruitment, and we see this all the time. People back out at all stages: before interview, during pre-employment checks, just before their start date. Hell, 1 day to 2 weeks after they start. No one is annoyed because at the end of the day, it's recruitment, it happens, and people do what they need to do.

Yeah, great response. I did you the courtesy of a reasonably thought out answer, but it was a waste of time, wasn't it? If you think, despite all the evidence to the contrary, that it actually happened, then you prove my point - people upvote based on what they want to be true rather than what is true, and that skews the perceived tone of this sub.

&gt;Hm. Contradicting yourself a bit there.

Not really. Proof and reason to believe something are not the same. You can't prove that there isn't an invisible teapot orbiting the sun at the moment, but you'd be a fool to believe it. That's hardly a controversial position to take, or at odds with anything else I've said; it's entry-level logic. 

&gt;Doubtful. Wales and England don't have areas that are considered unsafe it you are a certain religion. People aren't killed every other week and they don't have riots on a yearly basis. NI has less immigrants than England or Wales, so what you're saying is just plain inaccurate. 

Yeah, see, you're confusing your opinion and perception with facts. That's what statistics are - facts. So, while you might think one thing, and be resistant to other viewpoints, statistics have this happy lack of amiguity. They are facts. Hate crimes per person are lower in Northern Ireland than in England and Wales, and because all UK police forces have to publish crime statistics, you can add them up and divide by head of population to see in which jurisdiction you're more likely to experience hate crime.

&gt;If people in /r/alabama constantly voted off pro confederate posts, would you label them all as SJW liberals? no. Loyalists and loyalist related posts are downvoted here because they are stupid, irrational fools. 

People downvoting stupid things =/= people upvoting clearly inaccurate things because it fits their biases.

If you think, despite all the evidence to the contrary, that it actually happened, then you prove my point - people upvote based on what they want to be true rather than what is true, and that skews the perceived tone of this sub.
&gt; 

Doesn't matter if it happened or not, the problem exists. And don't ask me to prove it for you. You're the one arguing it didn't happen.

&gt;Not really. Proof and reason to believe something are not the same. You can't prove that there isn't an invisible teapot orbiting the sun at the moment, but you'd be a fool to believe it. That's hardly a controversial position to take, or at odds with anything else I've said; it's entry-level logic.
.

&gt;Yeah, see, you're confusing your opinion and perception with facts.



So you are saying that you believe something without proof, therefore it is an opinion. You're quite the hypocrite. 



&gt;Yeah, see, you're confusing your opinion and perception with facts. That's what statistics are - facts. So, while you might think one thing, and be resistant to other viewpoints, statistics have this happy lack of amiguity. They are facts. Hate crimes per person are lower in Northern Ireland than in England and Wales, and because all UK police forces have to publish crime statistics, you can add them up and divide by head of population to see in which jurisdiction you're more likely to experience hate crime.


It's not true though. Cite your source. If it does indeed exist, I guarantee that you are twisting the context.



&gt;People downvoting stupid things =/= people upvoting clearly inaccurate things because it fits their biases.
For the most part, it's a good thing that /r/northernireland isn't representative of the population as a whole, because it makes discussion of things like gay marriage more tolerable, but that doesn't mean that its free of bias.

null,null,MrJohz,eng-westmidlands,West Midlands,null,"Yes I do.  I've seen asylum seekers and the shit they go through.  It's horrible.

I have a friend who was beaten, and fled the country fearing for his life, leaving behind his brothers and a fiancé.  The brothers are now trying to survive in a refugee camp, and the fiancé is dead.  I was with him after we found out about his fiancé and I have never seen someone so broken in my life.

The government believes that his life is not in danger, and that he should go back to his country of origin.  He is appealing this, but at one point he was offered a deal where he could go home voluntarily, with money to start a new life (this is a courtesy most asylum seekers receive).  He explained that he was physically unable to bring himself to do that, however good he knew the deal was, because how could he voluntarily go back to the country that had broken him and his family so badly?

This is one case.  I don't know how many people like it there are, and I am sure there are many people on the opposite side - people who have little need of our safety, but who can ""play the system"" and get asylum in Britain.  But there are definitely people for whom their reality is such that if we send them back to their home countries we might as well have put the gun to their heads ourselves, and I am not comfortable with doing that.

For me, it's never been about collecting TOPS numbers (the registration system for individual locomotives, coaches and multiple units on the National Rail network). I've always been more interested in travelling by train just to cover the country, without any interest in 'scoring' (i.e. travelling onboard) each multiple unit in a certain class.

Because of this, I've covered most of the UK by train. I've been to Penzance, Wick, Mallaig, Norwich and Folkestone by train, with lots of places in between. I formerly took lots of day trips: in February I travelled to Manchester one Saturday, and after buying a Greater Manchester Wayfarer, headed out to quite a few destinations, such as Rochdale, Wigan, and Buxton (the line to Buxton is the most scenic of the lot).

Yet, I've never felt inclined to make lists of how many trains I've ""bashed"", or even to colour in my Baker atlas (a railway map of the UK detailing all open passenger and freight-only lines published roughly every few years). I've even stopped going on days out on my own because not only do I feel a bit lonely, but because the railway: well, apart from the way it's run, it's just so *boring*.

I'm inclined to believe the reason why the numbers of lads interested in 'bashing' has decreased, and why older enthusiasts are losing interest in the railways, is due to increased standardisation. For example, even in the early 1990s, a station like Bristol Temple Meads would have considerably more variety than it does today, with loco-hauled cross-country trains, the remaining first-generation DMUs on local services to Severn Beach, Taunton, Gloucester and Cardiff, parcel trains, a much greater variety of locos on freight trains (and a greater range of freight trains) and shunting locomotives going about their business.

At the same station today, the only locomotives you'll typically find on freight trains are US-built class 66s and 70s, while the variety in passenger traction is far less.

Regrettably, I did hint to some people at Uni I had an interest in railways (I assumed people wouldn't be too bothered) and I still got odd looks :(",null,0,null,1438554496,null,null,false,0,ctpabbj,null,t3_3fijbk,null,null,null,t3_3fijbk,null,null,null,1440243042,null,7,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7,null

He's too easily out-thought and his arrogance and want to make a point, choosing his own signings over others, has proved hugely detrimental.

So it may be that it's the non mineral oil ingrediants are irritating you. It may also be that your ratios of castor / tea tree oil were too high and causing irritation.  But ofc you could be sensitive to castor or tea tree oil regardless of the ratio. And although mineral oil is supposed to be highly unlikely to cause a reaction to skin there are people who report that it has to them. 

I found that adding in a second cleanse (after OCM) using a foaming wadh helped remove any remaining oil and although I can't say that singularly helped clear up my skin I'm very sure it contributed to it. 

I too wear full face makeup and sunscreen and wonder if two goes of oil cleanse might be too much for your skin. My OCM is to pour some oil ( DIY blend of tea tree oil and pure mineral oil - not baby oil) in to my hands and gently rub it all over including my lids and lashes, then wipe off with a damp warm microfibre cloth (toweling material is harsh and scratchy), lather up a small amount if foam wash and wipe over face then rinse off with tepid water.  Maybe adjusting your OCM will help. 

IIRC LRP tends to have fragrance in it, maybe those are making your skin unhappy. 

It sounds like you've tried a lot of things though, and honestly I would ask your GP for a referal to see a derm.  A derm can be much more thorough and investigate causes that may not be apparent. - I'm getting tested for andrognes by an NHS derm to see if too much testosterone is causing my acne.

I think the economic case for the EU has been proven without a doubt, to the extent that even those who wish to leave will almost without exception firmly wish to remain in the EFTA where we would have to still abide by many regulations without having any say.


In legislation too I think the EU has been beneficial with things like the working hours directive. But it's fair to say as an already very developed nation we probably don't see the true force for change that the EU is. Later eastern entrants to the EU have been massively changed by EU membership and even countries that are not yet members, like Serbia, are making huge efforts to meet EU standards in the hope of opening up membership, even going as far as starting to resolve some incredibly bitter disputes with their neighbours.


I think it's extremely clear that the EU is the future for Europe, it almost seems archaic to go back to a time where the borders on our very crowded continent were real obstacles to travel and business. Politically too an EU with a single-ish voice has a chance at influencing geopolitics in a way that single states, yes even the UK, will not be able to do to the same extent for much longer.


But the EU certainly isn't perfect, of course it isn't, it's a trail blazing multinational organisation that has to balance efficiency with respecting the voices of it's constituent nation states. With time I think it's inevitable that the EU will become more streamlined and I'm sure the UK will continue to be one of the last to sign up to, well, everything, but on the flip side our permanent tinge of euroskepticism will ensure that any moves to ""ever closer union"" will be thoroughly scrutinised by a major player.


However, if we simply leave, I believe we will be on the wrong side of history. Going back to any level of Splendid Isolation when we have something as amazing as the EU to be a part of would be a great shame and a massive detriment, especially in the decades to come when Britain inevitably looses more of it's residual prestige, for example the commonwealth will diminish further and our UNSC permanent seat will surely be contested, we'll soon realise that we're not a rung above France or Germany and that our best hope is to work with them if we haven't already short-sightedly jumped ship. Britain is nearing the end of it's international clouts decline from the peak of Empire but we have the chance to remain on the upward trajectory of the EU which will become a bigger and bigger player, we shouldn't throw that away by trying to move back into the past, it simply won't work.

That said, the course you take may make a difference to the amount of money student finance can help with, my partner does marine biology and they're throwing money at her. I made also sure I lived in a house share outside of the main uni area and with older students and working people to ensure I didn't repeat my own mistake.

null,null,[deleted],null,null,null,"Wow that's great thanks!  I thought it's normally better to save up the emergency fund first as quick as possible though then start saving for retirement? Am I mistaken in this assumption?

I had come up with a budget before, but it was based on best guesses and what I knew from living in the Midlands before:

- Interest-free loan on Travelcard through work, so £107 per month
- £217 groceries (£50 a week)
- £90 utilities (gas, electricity, internet if not included in rent)
- £850 rent/council tax (£950 if includes bills)
- £260 eating out/social
- £15 phone (what I paid for Three PAYG)
- £130 on miscellaneous purchases (haircuts, new blender/toaster, plates, etc.), save if not all used
- £25 gym

That left about £710 to save per month which would mean saving up a 3-month emergency fund (if I deplete my current savings) in 5-6 months from scratch (with no actual saving for trip home). If I instead contributed 8% immediately that'd be £547 left over a month which would mean saving the same fund in 7-8 months (longer if I save for home as well). Does this sound reasonable?

&gt;It is the very definition of hypocrisy. You are saying something is a fact, but you are also saying that you can't prove it, therefore it is an opinion. And you then proceeded to accuse me of doing the same thing. 

Well, you were actually the one that said it was fact, not me. I said it was a pretty transparant lie. It's pretty clear to me that it's not true, same as it's pretty clear to my satisfaction that there is no invisible teapot orbiting the sun. I can't prove either, but if we're going to reduce all such instances to opinion, then pretty much everything in science from the atom onwards is just an opinion. Which would be bollocks, however strongly you might feel about it.

&gt;Firstly, the population of England and Wales is closer to 58 million. Secondly, you have just proved my point. There is a disproportionately high amount of hate crime in NI compared to England and Wales.

&gt;NI is what roughly 3% of the UK's population and yet their hate crime statistics are only like 40x larger than ours. Maybe the big numbers are confusing you?

Err.. I don't know how to break this to you, but if we're 3% of their population, then for them to have the same propertional level of hate crime, they'd need to be 33 times our level. They're 40 times our level. Which is, you know, more. As in, they have more hate crime. 

Let's go with 56m for England and Wales. There are 44,450 hate crimes per 56,000,000 people. That's one hate crime per 1,260 people. In NI, there are 1132 per 1,800,000 people. That's one hate crime per 1,590 people. 

Hate crime is proportionally higher in England and Wales.

Because Burnham is a chameleon (as you well know).

Because we can get excited for standing up for the little guy/*doing the right thing* under Corbyn.

Because we need to be able to tell people to vote Labour on this basis, not just because they're the least objectionable option.

The choice for me is simple and clear. The myth that winning elections supersedes the idea that one should stand for something, and that people who stand up for others can't win elections needs to be challenged, and this is the time to do it. If you question why you're on this side of the fence at all, I believe that's the conclusion to which you'll come. We shouldn't have to compromise on what's right to gain votes, but rather do it and convince people its so. That's leadership, not running whichever way public opinion indicates.

However if you disagree, and many do, I urge you to make Corbyn at least your second preference. Take a chance on hope, because fighting for what's right nobly might just gain us more than trying to flip flop and pander to polls; I believe the latter strategy will fail to gain us a majority come 2020, whereas the former just might do it.",null,0,null,1438557503,null,null,false,0,ctpbul3,null,t3_3fey9j,null,null,null,t3_3fey9j,null,null,null,1440243765,null,1,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,1,null

&gt; If you think that 'Proving a negative is fairly difficult and in many cases impossible.' is something I just made up, you should probably go talk to anyone with a background in science, logic, or statistics.

You are lying by saying that I asked you to prove a negative. And the rest of what you said there was just a load of noise to attempt to save face.

&gt;Well, you were actually the one that said it was fact, not me. I said it was a pretty transparant lie. It's pretty clear to me that it's not true, same as it's pretty clear to my satisfaction that there is no invisible teapot orbiting the sun. I can't prove either, but if we're going to reduce all such instances to opinion, then pretty much everything in science from the atom onwards is just an opinion. Which would be bollocks, however strongly you might feel about it.


I never said it was a fact. More lies. You sound like one of those pretentious atheists. Wise up.



&gt;Err.. I don't know how to break this to you, but if we're 3% of their population, then for them to have the same propertional level of hate crime, they'd need to be 33 times our level. They're 40 times our level. Which is, you know, more. As in, they have more hate crime.


God you are an idiot. And can I also say that you're deliberately ignoring the fact that the overwhelming majority of hate crimes occur in Belfast and Derry, which is what 400,000 people? You're digging a deeper hole for yourself.

Plus one side of my family is super into the military and they were pretty much all abusive to each other. This does not mean that the majority of soldiers are evil people, most of they are pretty normal and don't go out of their way to show off.

That being said, you have to understand the reason we give discounts to veterans and active members. It isn't about heroism but just to support them if they're having tough times at home. I have a friend who is a veteran and he has trouble keeping up with the bills due to problems he's had since he came back from being deployed. He currently suffers from rather bad anxiety and has to deal with guilt and depression. This makes it incredibly difficult for him to get a job. 

The fact that he can go out and save at least a bit of money on things like food and other luxuries that he couldn't really afford before at least makes him feel a bit more normal than before.

Well first there's this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Non-Proliferation_of_Nuclear_Weapons

And that many countries are actively discouraged from developing weapons of mass destruction.  Britain also has a permanent seat on the UN Security Council, all the countries with Veto power do have nuclear weapons, so we aren't necessarily exactly analogous to other countries.  Many countries that don't have Nuclear Weapons have military treaties, such as Monaco, whose defence would be handled by France in the event of a war.  The countries that have these weapons do try to keep a monopoly on them too, that's why we generally know Israel has developed nuclear weapons but they won't actually declare them, or why Iran is being sanctioned because it is believed they may try to develop nuclear weapons.

&gt;What's your explanation for that?

I'm not trying to 'explain' anything, it's a good thing that they haven't developed these weapons, nuclear weaponry is awful, no one's happy they were invented or used at all I'm sure, but they have been and really they have kept the peace through the threat of mutually assured destruction, I wish we didn't live in that world, but we do.  Anti-ICBM missile shields have come a long way though since WWII, so who knows maybe the issue could be resolved, fortunately we've never needed to test them.


&gt;They've certainly concluded the world is a safer place without having them.

Well that doesn't mean they're right does it?  International politics isn't like crowd-sourcing an opinion, Probably somewhere like The Seychelles don't need these weapons, they're smaller, less tactically important and probably couldn't develop a nuclear weapon, on the other hand the boarder between Pakistan and India is tactically important, Pakistani politics are highly militarized, very corrupt and they have dozens of militias, If I was in India I'd probably sleep better at night knowing that my country has Nuclear warheads pointed into Pakistan, and probably people in Pakistan sleep sounder by knowing that the same is true for their country, it's a messy solution, but until real peace is achieved nukes are probably the only thing keeping both Countries from simply sending huge armies to occupy disputed territories.  


My only solution is for places like The Middle East, Eastern Europe (which it mainly has) and the Indian sub-continent to come to lasting peace treaties, to get rid of corrupt dictators and live together peacefully, then have a unilateral world wide agreement to disarm, dispose of and legally bind themselves to never build these weapons again.  In the meantime I think it would be a sensible and a step in the right direction for morality for Britain to adopt a legally binding no-first-use policy, and something with real legal consequences if the government ever fired a nuclear weapon first, I think all countries should do this as a real step towards peace too.  The Nuclear Weapons we do have in any case can be considered as purely for secondary retaliation purposes, that's why they're on Submarines so that they can stay hidden and be moved around, I don't actually think Britain maintains missile silos on land any more, as far as I've ever heard anyway.

Like I said, it would be unacceptable if we were ever attacked by nuclear weapons to simply not retaliate against the aggressor and allow them to invade, I don't think it would be right to allow the citizenry of this country to left to a people who may have just killed millions.  As I said this is far fetched, but things change, if Britain left NATO and wished to rejoin later that could piss off somewhere like Russia, or Iran leading them to actually attack Britain, just because we wouldn't have nuclear weapons we'd still have conventional weapons I assume, so we wouldn't be a push over, so if in a far fetched scenario this did happen, and we weren't a part of NATO, we could end up in a situation where Britain is simply surrendered to keep the peace, like what is happening to the Ukraine, and I imagine that situation seemed far fetched after the giddy days after the fall of the Berlin wall.

His terminology is messed up a bit but other than that I don't think this is news. There are sequential hermaphrodites on Earth, it makes sense that they would show up in aliens as well. Especially aliens that regrow and change their entire body occasionally. With ""all of us"" I think he is drawing in the idea of a gender spectrum which has a decent amount of evidence and is part of identity politics. 

Here are the [basics of sequential hermaphroditism.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermaphrodite#Sequential_hermaphrodites) Hermaphroditism is a biological term that accurately applies to many different species. You may see people claiming that this is intersexuality but that is a actually a broad term for disorders that encompasses hypospadia, CAH, AIS, chromosomal variations and yes, hermaphroditism. True human hermaphroitism only occurs in about 0.001% of births and it refers specifically to the presence of both types of gonadal tissue, either as ovaries+testes or ovotestes. Intersexed people are a larger group, of which hermaphrodites are an extremely rare subset.   

Generally, male and female refer to sex not gender. Saying no one is 100% ""stereotypical man or woman"" would be more a precise way of phrasing this. I think it is clear that he meant gender and misspoke. He could have been referring to microchimeric cells from the opposite sex in some individuals (basically all mothers for instance) but that's pretty unlikely. 

In any case, we are talking about a full-scale biological restructuring of an alien species which can switch from male to female over the course of its life time and presumably retains fertility. It seems to be then that *bidirectional sequential hermaphoditism* would be the correct terminology. In Time Lords, this is not a change in gender but a total change in biological sex. To me this means that Doctor Who might not be the best vehicle to tackle ideas of human sex, sexuality and gender. That's a discussion for another time though. From a sci-fi standpoint, I think the idea is pretty neat but I don't think he was talking about it in a very precise way here.

Gender is an ill defined concept. The poster above is referring to sociological theories in which gender is defined by societally determined gender roles. You are referring to the developmental and biological concept of neurological gender. Neither of you is particularly wrong but different fields sometimes use the same word in different ways. 

Another example is that in biology, something can be ""stereotyped in location"" across individuals, meaning that it is nearly identical in its anatomical location for a whole species.

However I take issue with your characterisation of the Seychelles as a country that doesn't need nukes. I'm familiar with the NPT, and the consequence of that treaty is only 9 counties *in the world* have nukes at all. You can find many examples of countries surrounded by despotism, threatened and yet not needing to build nukes even if they have the capability. Iran and Iranians are safer without nukes, as are South Africans, and I don't see how being a little more like Switzerland or Denmark would be such a bad thing. Hell even the Dutch haven't armed themselves and they'd probably come under more immediate threat than us.

My view in the sort of medium term is that we need to focus on internationalising institutions. Pointing nukes at each other, building garrisons against each other, and intervening with drones isn't the morally right or civilised path to take, and it'll stunt our progress as a species. With that in mind, and the positions of most of the ""non-aligned"" countries, I don't see there being a point in the ""nuclear deterrent."" The sort of attack we would suffer, a terrorist dirty bomb rather than a conventional nuke, wouldn't be dissuaded by such a weapon. In my view we need to scale back aggressive interventionism and give more power to the UN. People say its a shitty institution, but a lot of that is because its hands are tied with respect to powerful countries and powerful people, and if the peacekeepers did what they were supposed to we would have no need for NATO in a post-Cold War world.

Only weirdos like you and me talk so deep like this. Unable to shirk the compulsive urge to continue to respond. Everyone else is several parents back.  

I'm just ""backtracking"" because I feel like you're taking this situation farrrrr more seriously than I was when I made my original comment. It's like the timbre of how I would say the words were lost over the internet and echoed into a room full of offended Cilla Black lovers through a loudhailer. 

I still stand by my words. I'm glad she's dead because now I can rest easy knowing that my mind wont be scarred during a BBC Children in Need special where some producer had the idea of bringing her over for a ""Surprise Surprise"" one-off special.  

Maybe the ""joke"" doesn't translate to you because you don't share my generational culture or smth but the idea is that she is the pinnacle and representation of early 90's prime time TV. You're sitting there eating somewhat stale blue ribbons at Grandma's, your Dad is telling a really bad joke, you just want to leave the room and go upstairs to play Sega but you can't. Instead you have to watch fucking Blind Date with Cilla Black.  
I don't understand how much further I have to go to translate this. I genuinely swear I could probably recount an average episode off the top of my head even though I hated it.  Forced to watch by social obligation every week, every week, **without fail**.  

&gt;  AND YOUR HOST: MISS CILLA BLAAAAAAACK.   
&gt; Al'ight chuck! We have a real treat in store fur yur today......  

Seriously, this conversation is giving me flashbacks now.  
Were you forced as a child to sing hymns at school? Its just like that. Having to regurgitate shitty pithy words praising a probably non-existent deity etched into the dark recesses of my mind even though I didn't ask for it. I could bark out several on command but it would annoy me a lot to do so.  

And that's why I don't like Cilla Black. She was the poster child for this force-fed, prime time TV junk fest of trite, its all in my head and I never asked for it nor wanted it there.   

Y'see some people get offended by all sorts of shit, you are evidently offended by me being happy that Cilla Black is dead but I don't really get ""offended"" by stuff like that. What offends me if I _really_ had to choose (and tbf, this stuff existing is okay as now as an adult I can just avoid it so i'd have to forced to choose) would be shit like Blind Date or if I was to go more contemporary I'd say X-Factor. I genuinely am utterly unable to watch an episode of X-Factor or any sort of reality show, especially the ones with judges. Their lack of qualifications, the over-produced nature, the falsity of it all, the scripedness, the sickening appeals to pulling on heart-strings, all of the poor chumps that feel like wandering into that room full of sycophantic tosspots all puffed up on their judges chairs is their best route to stardom. Its all so very sad and it offends me much like Blind Date ""offended"" me back in the 90s. Its just crass bottom-of-the-barrel wank catering for the lowest common denominator built upon a web of shallow lies, TV ratings and backroom marketing gurus talking shite about key demographics.

Corbyn simply doesn't satisfy those requirements. He'll probably manage to shore up support in areas  Labour's failing badly, but as for making actual progress into Tory-held seats? He's a non-starter. 

This is, of course, ignoring the fact that CCHQ know *exactly* how to deal with ideologies like Corbyn's - they absolutely eviscerated them over and over again in the eighties and nineties, and Corbyn is *one of the people they were fighting against then*. The ""Loony Left"" propaganda will hit hard from day one of a Corbyn leadership - sabre-rattling from ""concerned businesses"", laser-focus suddenly being brought to bear on the man's awkward views on international affairs, and an incessant, well-funded assault on his character hurled at him from all corners of the Tory-sympathetic press. 

The only media outlets of note Corbyn will have on his side are the Mirror, Guardian and Independent. That isn't enough to counter the firestorm that'll hit him the second he locks himself into office - if he leads Labour into 2020, it'll make what Miliband had to deal with look like a light graze.

The economy's in decent shape, and that's fairly likely to continue for the duration of this parliament. If nothing changes there, the Tories will be able to present a record of economic competence, an entire decade of stability, and steadily-improving prospects. 

The cards are all in the Tories' hands.

null,null,terrymcginnisbeyond,,Labour Member,null,"&gt; However I take issue with your characterisation of the Seychelles as a country that doesn't need nukes.

I don't want to get into a heated debate, but countries either do or they don't, the crux of what you asked me was, most countries don't need nukes and the feel that they've concluded that they're safer without them.  Which is it? Nukes or no Nukes, I'd certainly say a small oceanic state made of islands with few resources and not being highly industrialised or especially rich, they have issues with pirates from Somalia I guess, but I think a nuke would be over kill.

&gt;despotism, threatened and yet not needing to build nukes even if they have the capability.

Maybe, maybe on the other hands their enemies would be more wary of posturing at a state that has nuclear weapons, and in fact some countries surrounded by despotic failed semi-failed states want nuclear weapons like Israel, or arguably Iran.  Like I say we don't actually have to base our defence policy on anything pre-existing, we don't need to be the US we don't have to be like Denmark, we're Britain and we need to find what is best suited for us, I think having a second retaliation platform is sensible for now and allows us to not be threatened and have that ability to defend our own allies. Remember only France and ourselves maintain a nuclear arsenal, and if we're all together in Europe, we owe it to our neighbours to defend them, a military alliance where you fire on your allies enemies still counts as retaliation, not first use, certainly Poland was spooked by Crimea, and haven't always had an easy relationship on their boarder with Russia.

&gt;My view in the sort of medium term is that we need to focus on internationalising institutions. Pointing nukes at each other, 


&gt;building garrisons against each other, and intervening with drones isn't the morally right or civilised path to take, and it'll 

&gt;stunt our progress as a species.


I completely agree, you'll get no argument of any kind from me.


&gt;most of the ""non-aligned"" countries,


I do think we have to accept Russia as a non-aligned major power though, Putin clearly is not acting in a civilized manner, and there are a lot of issues within the countries political system at the moment,  I find it unlikely Putin would have considered a land grab of Crimea had Ukraine not voluntarily given up its nuclear weapons.


&gt;The sort of attack we would suffer, a terrorist dirty bomb rather than a conventional nuke, wouldn't be dissuaded by such a 


&gt;weapon.


No they wouldn't, I guess it would depend on the situation though, if it turned out to be of a hostile foreign power sponsored terrorist threat, then maybe we would need our warheads, especially if the attack was on multiple targets and possibly sustained.  I'd consider a dirty bomb a nuclear attack, I don't think it matters whether the payload comes in the form of the payload on an ICBM or inside Samsonite luggage.  People will still die a very unpleasant death, in fact considering a dirty bomb is more about causing deadly prolonged fallout it would still be less barbaric to use conventional nuclear weapons.


&gt;In my view we need to scale back aggressive interventionism and give more power to the UN.

I believe in staying in NATO as well as giving power to UN, people think it's a shitty institution too, the same with the UN, but they can both play a part in defence.


At the moment we have to accept the world we're in, retiring Trident in say the next 10 years might be a bad idea, but during that time we could be really trying to get full disarmament going, start trying to set an actual date for full disarmament, see how NATO, The UN and Europe feels about getting rid of these weapons fully, get Russia to finally agree, get diplomacy going in India and Pakistan, and hold Israel to the same scrutiny as any other state and get them to give up their own weapons.  We'd have to really wait and get some concrete answers and dates from all these parties it is possible, but if we keep getting rebuffed we have to admit to living with the bomb.

There's also the issue that these powers like NATO and the Warsaw Pact countries did stop Europe from going to full on total war using standing armies, such a war was impossible because of escalation, so neither party tried, but if we hadn't had nukes there's a very real possibility that we could have seen another land war in Europe leading to millions of more deaths, more destitution and less peace.

It's a shame that we had to live in the world where the only reason why war was averted was through fear, but you can't argue with results, and personally I don't think the human psyche has developed much beyond the 50's.

Corbyn won't manage the ~10% swing necessary.

Those who do take umbrage with living costs come out with the most stupid shit you've ever heard, like ""Oh, I wish I didn't have to live in Clapham!""  Well fucking **don't**, then?  Why not move?

When my ex partner and I were moving from the North-East to London we only had 2 days down there to view flats, so before our 2 day flat viewing trip I arranged a few viewings for that time.

There was one in particular that seemed very nice and central to where we wanted to be, I exchanged emails with the landlady for a while with photos and details and tried to arrange a viewing, she was very difficult and said she was away for the 2 days we were down there, but if we know we like the property why not just send her the bond and first months rent via western union (DING DING DING!!) and we could just move in.

 1) private sector pensions have been decimated since around '97 

2) the current 40-50 year olds have adapted with rental properties which has intrigued to the price of houses. The government are now trying to cut back on this. A fair number (especially those in London) seem to be planning to just cash out on their house which is now worth 4x more than they bought it for (despite wages since they bought it in many cases hardly rising).

3) the country relies on the services sector and nearly every decent graduate is working in accounting, advertising, finance, consultancy, law (etc), so with more and more automation happening and the inevitable rise of huge firms from the Far East the government is bent over a barrel to keep London competitive a large number are likely going to either be out of a job, or paid relatively less compared to somebody of a similar level today (ie. most won't be on the big bucks).

So putting it all together, if you're pissing away all your money in your 20s (which literally 9/10 people I know are doing - all from some of the best Uni's in the country no less), and aren't going to be earning a huge amount by 35-50 then you'll never be able to afford a house / make enough substantial investments to keep you afloat for the 20-30 years of retirement.

You're right though, can't win. Best bet is taking advantage of the number of idle grads who don't seem too bothered about anything -whilst the majority of people seem to be enjoying living out a repressed sex in the city fantasy, learn your business, find some people who know what they're doing, and make yourselves a decent sized pie to make some real money from.

null,null,Tallis-man,null,null,null,"This comparison of Corbyn to the 1980s is convenient but flawed.  Socialism is no longer a dirty word: there is no Cold War; newspapers can no longer hint at shadowy treacherous connections to foreign governments.

Corbyn has shown himself adept at puncturing the failed Thatcherite ideologies Cameron and Osborne are trying to revive.  His real talent so far has been in challenging the claim that Conservative or Tory-light views represent those of 'ordinary people'.  He only needs to point to surveys of the public to reveal this.  Miliband was so desperate to avoid the charge of being overly left-wing that his prescription for problems was invariably New-Labour market-intervention rather than a genuinely unapologetically left-wing approach; price freezes for energy and rail rather than renationalisation, for instance.  The problem with such policies is that they are inherently economical, and so allow easy accusations of economic illiteracy, and people's opinions of the policies and the man are thus swayed.  Corbyn's remedies are simpler; he can simply point to overwhelming popular support for his proposals, or to continental Europe, and dare the Conservatives to accuse a majority of the electorate of being ignorant or naive, or to suggest that Germany and France are somehow socialist dystopias.

The second real difference from Miliband is that Corbyn is a 'people person'.  He is genuinely likeable, and likeably genuine.  The media won't have an easy ride criticising his personal manner for three or four years; they'll have to go straight for the policies, and after a few years on repeat those attacks will start to wear thin in the public consciousness.  The Conservative party's leadership in 2020 will be some natural evolution of its 'greenest government ever', 'hug a hoody' leadership of 2005-2010, probably Osborne.  We have all seen its dramatic return to the 'nasty party' it spent a decade trying to make us forget, and we have all seen his transformational personal rebranding over the same period.  This amorphous inconsistency provides an open goal if one has the record of integrity to exploit it without opening oneself up to similar charges.

I like your thinking on trying to make things interesting, and while I agree with some of your ideas, I think they are moving in the wrong direction.

 The Daleks (in the modern series) were interesting because when we first see them, there is only one, and it absolutely wrecks shop. Just one Dalek evoked such strong emotion from The Doctor, we knew it was serious. Once the numbers started to increase, it creates a sort of [conservation problem](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConservationOfNinjutsu), where the Daleks are no longer as deadly as they once seemed. This is the same problem with the Weeping Angels. They were terrifying because there were only four, yet they almost stole the Tardis, and were incredibly deadly. As more and more were featured, they became less and less interesting. I personally always thought the Cybermen were weak, but I liked the idea that there were parallel worlds they did in fact conquer, and that's how they were breaking through to this world. And that is also why I loved the Master. The Master was awesome because the Master WON. The Master beat the Doctor. Eventually the Doctor would triumph, but not before he initially lost. I was really excited about Missy, but basically the Doctor out thought her super fast. Yeah there was the Cyberman army, but he out thought Missy's plan. The Master is supposed to be the one that out thinks the Doctor!

Anyways, I think less is more. They should phase out Daleks and Cybermen, and bring them back only for maybe 2 parter episodes, emphasizing that when these guys show up, shit has gotten real. Doctor Who is no longer the low-budget show it was. They can introduce new recurring villains, and don't need to throw back to old villains. 

Maybe an alien race shows up that never existed before because all the time and universe retcon resetting, and they are experimenting with time travel, causing problems they may not realize, and that the Doctor can't fix - or maybe they experience time differently and that causes problems. Idk, I think new would be great, as opposed to the villains that the Doctor already ALWAYS beats. I realize he always will win, but there is no longer any tension. I think this was really illustrated when Matt Smith's run ended. When he's on the tower or whatever screaming to the Daleks  that ""they mentioned rules"" as he is being regenerated by Galifrey, and that the rules don't apply to the Doctor. You go into a show know the main character probably won't die, but when the character actually admits that, it takes away from the experience. Not that I don't love Doctor Who, but it really changed it from a significant show to me, to just a silly romp. The stories no longer have meaning, because there will be no lasting consequences. Like when the Doctor turns out to have actually saved Galifrey. What the actual shit? That defined the new Doctor. It influenced his decisions and actions towards others. It's part of why he hated the Daleks so much. It wasn't just the one time he truly failed, but it was the one time he failed that he knew he couldn't fix. No matter how many crazy stories he got into, that always hung over his head, eating away at him. And when Galifrey finally has a chance to come back in Tennant's run, he has to let it go to save earth, doubling his failure. But nah, Galifrey is all good, don't you worry. They even got the Doctor's back, bringing him who knows how many new regenerations. This completely shattered any meaning of dread, consequence, or character development revolving around the Doctor.

Ok, I ranted a bit. Takeaway: new, yet still not always used villains for the 'over arcing schemes' across seasons. They were on a good path with The Great Intelligence but it personally fizzled a bit for me. But that doesn't mean they shouldn't keep trying new directions!

I hope Alli ends up being the second coming of Paul Pogba for us, but even he looks more like a box-to-box goal threat than a proper destroyer.  We have plenty of options for CM, but none of them (aside from Milos who Poch doesn't seem to fancy much based on how little he's featured in friendlies, and Dier, who is makeshift at best) are proper CDMs.

Still, I totally agree with you up front though.  As bad as our defence was last season, a huge part of it was an inability to properly defend from the front and sustain attacking pressure on our opponents.  We're far too static and slow on attack, and as soon as we lose the ball, we're vulnerable to fast counters.

null,null,notwherebutwhen,null,null,null,"When it comes to the viability of any character especially in the long term it becomes a trade off between personal investment and their utility in a story. It doesn't take long for a riveting/interesting character to become an old hat. And adding more interesting or riveting elements to a character doesn't always make them more interesting or riveting and if done scattershot just makes for a inconsistent character. And adding a new riveting or interesting character only really helps in the short term not in the long term.

When a character is first introduced and in their early days personal investment usually isn't that important as the character is fresh and nearly any appearance by the character has a high utility. As they keep on appearing their utility can often drop especially if they appear frequently. This isn't necessarily the fault of the production team, writers, or actors although it can be. And a drop in utility isn't necessarily a detriment to enjoyment, but it can lead to a drop in how interesting or riveting the character is.

There is a point where it becomes far more difficult to create good utilization for a character and where personal investment becomes more important than their utility. For example people who love and are extremely invested in the Daleks will probably not care as much over repetitive or ineffective utilization.

So it isn't that they need to create new and interesting villains, because they have done that on multiple occasions. It is that the villains need to be utilized properly. They need to focus more on the individuality of the villains rather than on their villainy. We need to see more villains in their own element or on their own home field or acting in a way that isn't just as opposition for the Doctor to face. 

Madame Kovarian for example wasn't really her own villain, she just represented the villainy opposed to the Doctor. We never get a sense that she is irreplaceable or that her disappearance from the story would impact it in a meaningful way. The Cybermen in Dark Water/Death In Heaven are another good example because we never get a sense that they are plotting something or are gaining something by handing over their technology and control to Missy. Neither do we get a sense of how Missy holds her power over them or if she somehow co-opted their technology. It isn't that their inclusion in the story is the misstep, but rather that we don't really get a good explanation or feeling for their utility beyond a mode for Missy to commit her own plan which could have been filled by something else.",null,0,null,1438570395,null,null,false,0,ctpidtr,null,t3_3fkd4x,null,null,null,t3_3fkd4x,null,null,null,1440246910,null,1,null,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1,null

In the first of this week’s profiles on newcomers to the Premier League, our football writer looks at Liverpool’s big signing

There was a name that few in Brazil recognised when Carlos Dunga, the head coach, announced his squad to face Turkey last November. That is not so unusual these days, not when there are certain games in which the world’s most famous national team are commanded to select only foreign-based players, so as to ensure that their demanding fixture schedule does not disrupt the domestic calendar.

This was an extreme example, though; a player who needed a bit of an explanation. If Roberto Firmino was going to be donning that famous yellow shirt, if he was going to be a part of Brazil’s attempts to put their World Cup humiliation behind them, it would help if people had heard of him.

The background of Liverpool’s new signing is the one so typical of Brazilian players. He grew up in Maceio, in the north of the country, halfway between Salvador and Recife. It is famous not only for its picturesque coastline but for its murder rate, high enough to make it the most dangerous in Brazil.

He lived in what is known as a “red zone”, a place plagued by gang violence, where the risks were so real that his mother often barred him from leaving the house as a child. As a teenager, he sold bottles of water and coconuts on the city’s beaches to help his family to get by.

His story follows the familiar arc. He joined the youth ranks of one of the local sides, CRB. He was obviously talented, but he struggled to find a role in the team — he spent many of his formative years playing as a defensive midfielder until the club dentist spotted something in him. He took him under his wing and became his agent. He had a trial with Sao Paulo but was rejected. He did rather better at Figueirense, a side based in the surfers’ paradise of Florianopolis: he scored with two overhead kicks in the opening hour of his first practice game. The club nurtured him as an attacking midfielder, gave him his debut and set him on the path to becoming a star.

It is here, though, that Firmino’s journey diverges from the traditional Brazilian tale to become something more modern. First, Figueirense did not own his registration: that belonged to a minor side called Tombense, run by the agent and entrepreneur Eduardo Uram, who had bought Firmino’s economic rights and loaned him back to the side.

Second, he only played professionally in his homeland for little more than a year — he made his debut in October 2009 and left in December 2010 — when Uram struck a deal to take him to Hoffenheim, the Bundesliga club. Figueirense, at the time, were mired in Brazil’s second division. Apart from their own supporters, few would have been familiar with Firmino’s name when he left; fewer still would have seen him play. Dunga claims that he watched him at Figueirense and tried to sign him after his first year in Germany.

This is the problem with the modern Brazil. So young do the country’s clubs and agents send their players to Europe that often they do not have any connection with fans back home. Worse still, they are unfamiliar with the conditions in South America, so whenever they do travel back — as Firmino did for the Copa America in Chile in June — they find it hard to adapt, no matter how well they have done in Europe.

It is why Neymar is so revered in his homeland: not just because he is a player of quite exceptional talent, but because he stayed for so long. He transcends traditional club loyalties because, although he was a symbol of Santos, he was also a standard-bearer for the Brazilian domestic game in a way that few others are.

Firmino has all the ingredients to be beloved by his country: superb technical skill, an eye for goal, 49 goals in 153 games in Germany, and now a £29 million move to Liverpool.

He moved his entire family across to the old world, vowing that they would never have to work again; he has the tattoos, the haircut and the social media footprint to appeal to the same demographic as Neymar; he has the model wife, the devout faith and the dress sense to be more than just a sporting phenomenon.

But there remains a degree of scepticism, and a tinge of ignorance, for how far he has come. In Maceio, of course, they are delighted by his success, not least because his former club, CRB, stand to gain about $1.1 million (£700,000) as a development fee.

null,null,Kiwi_the_Magnificent,null,null,null,"&gt;*I think the economic case for the EU has been proven without a doubt, to the extent that even those who wish to leave will almost without exception firmly **wish to remain in the EFTA where we would have to still abide by many regulations without having any say.***

The thing is that the *say*'s irrelevant:

We are obligated, by law due to being an EU state, to be both a part of the *single market* and *customs union*. The *customs union* are the ones pushing different regulations which are proposed by appointed commissioners. Not elected. MEPs can only vote on legislation. This *customs union* is applied indiscriminately to both our internal and external trade. So an institution **which states** make up some 45% of our trade and rapidly declining provides regulation to 100% of our economy. That's the idiocy of being a part of such *customs union*. We can still influence the customs between us and EU states being a part of UNECE which is the body suggesting regulation to the EU parliament.

Now EFTA allows us to drop the *customs union* and stay inside the *single market*. Remember that the regulation would only extend to the external trade which goes to EU states. This means that we don't get excessive bureaucratic blanket legislation which diminishes our industries trading both internally and externally. Opportunity, which costs are largely forgotten, in external trade would arise given how we are not allowed to discuss our own FTAs which diminished our ability to act on the world stage. We would then go on to retake our place in the WTO which for us are currently represented by an appointed EU individual. There is often a lot of scare that EU states would bar trade and sanction us in the case of leaving. A complete lie. Such behaviour is against WTO law. It's also stupid considering that we're one of the EUs biggest economies meaning that they need us *a lot* more than we need them. That's inside the EU. Outside then we could then trade with the *whole world* whether it be China, India, Russia, the USA, the commonwealth, African states which EU policy cripples or more. We would be no longer be isolated inside a dying protectionist economy. We could then look beyond.

We currently hold some 8% of MEP seats. That shrinks every time a country joins. It is, in that, still politically divided. We have lost against 90% of the stances parties universally protested. We used to have twice as many seats and one more commissioner (from two). Commissioners are appointed and still that is far to few to represent a nation/so many. Keep in mind that MEPs mean nothing in how they can't propose. It's only *yes* and *no*. We can transcend that by getting individual, represented and accountable representation in the World Trade Organisation and many more.

That's with disregarding all morality, security and democracy. The EU is a supranational institution, a body transcending the nation state, meaning that it holds the supremacy in law, courts, policy and so government. There's no democracy and accountability. It has disregarded referenda as shown time and time again. It's, in most, unelected.

We are not, by accepting the free movement of people, allowed to vet immigrants into who we do and do not want. That's unconditional with not being allowed to monitor who enters and who leaves. This means that criminals, like murderers and rapists, have been let on these islands and have gone onto commit horrific acts. It could've been prevented if vetting and checking was possible.

Another example:

You don't want to be illegally detained right? You know, without trial or evidence? That's well a perk of EU supremacy. European Courts transcend British justice. A constitution with acts like Habeus Corpus - the criminalisation of false detainment - at its core. The European Arrest Warrant (EAW), for example, allows any EU state to demand your detention without previous evidence or fair trial.

You see, the fifth Doctor was conceived as being the exact opposite of the fourth Doctor, except there wasn't a clear idea as to what that specifically would mean. So there are three main types of characterization for five; ineffective and weak willed, an old man just trying to have a nice ""long weekend"", and a weary old man who just wants the universe to bugger off while he enjoys a nice game of cricket. Of course one could argue that the later description always applied to five, but he spent the early part of his life trying to be a bit more enthusiastic before giving in to his grouchier nature. ETA the fact that half of the stories on the ""weary Doctor"" list come from his final season seems to support the grouchier as he ages idea.


""Castrovalva"" kicks off the later two characterizations rather well.

&gt;*What we need is some form of leverage to allow our powers in government to veto certain things.*

That's exactly what we can't do as members of the EU. It's engrained as part of their constitution. It's on its way to some EUropean Empire. The EU is a supranational body. Its court, government and policies transcend ours and thus national accountability. At least we can kick Cameron out. They surpass democracy.

&gt;*The problem with leaving the Euro, is that were too interconnected with the other members now, trade &amp; jobs would be negatively effected should we leave and it would take years to recover to where we are now.*

We would be leaving political ~~union~~ supremacy. There is a compromise called the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). We would not be breaking trade or ties. I explain in the comment below:

https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/3fj2sk/should_the_uk_exit_the_european_union_and_why_or/ctpjxpa

Be sure not to mismatch the Euro, EU or Europe.

&gt;*Also, the EU has a human rights bill that the govt want to remove for some reason and that is a SCARY thought*

The European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is an independent institution. If you want a point on human rights:

The European Courts surpass our own so, given a confliction, the EU court is given preference. An example of this would be in the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) in which allows for the illegal detainment of state citizens. Illegal by no evidence or fair trial. This given more power than, for example, the Habeus Corpus article of British justice/constitution which has long criminalised unlawful detention. British justice has a very thick and renowned constitution when it comes to liberties. It would be political suicide to a global degree to encroach.

I could see an episode where he has to face his failures. Say he lands on a jungle planet and the TARDIS freaks out and ditches him, taking the companion with it. He looks around and is drawn to a cave, maybe saying the infamous ""Abandon hope, all ye who enter here."" He enters the cave and sees the silhouette of a cyberman. Which then approaches and corners him. He ducks down and closes his eyes, but when he looks back up the cyberman is gone. 

Anyway he keeps facing things he has failed in, each one's danger being more than just disappearing. Maybe some attack him and transport him deeper.

College and Uni mainly seemed concerned about raising my maths grade. Think College took it to a GCSE grade C equivalent and I forget what Uni took it to, but I needed to do it to be allowed on a Games Programming course.

My teachers were actually a bit flabbergasted when I first got to college as I was the model student, even got me a student of the year award and finished all my work with the high marks (in some cases the highest possible, I'm not sure how, I read some of my Uni work which came after that and it's  not very good so I can't imagine my college work was much better).

As for my CV, I'd put stuff like GCSE Grade * Equivalent (for the grades I had) or other little one of courses I completed and only put my college and University grades on there hoping that they were more important, So I pretty much told them what I had and conveniently left off what I did not have or excel at.

In the case of rail, the state owns most of it already (they own the rail network itself) and they make the important decisions both for it and for the private train operators. They control fares, they control investment, they control new trains, they control upgrades, they control service frequencies. None of these are in the private train companies' hands. Decisions are made by politicians doing politics and vote buying. So nationalisation won't fix that.

It won't make fares lower (see East Coast as an example of that - their fares were not that cheap), it won't suddenly make it modern (that takes a government commitment that could occur whether the train operators are privatised or not), and it won't make it superb.

**Karl**: I didn't know that.

**Steve**: Yeah.

**Karl**: What's- what's that?

**Steve**: She went to see a medium and, uhh, supposedly her husband passed on information through the medium which was incredibly vague but, uhm, persuaded her to quit live on air.

True, but when the roads are at a standstill - and they frequently are in London because there's too much traffic on them - then the buses (along with all the other traffic) go nowhere. The last time I visited London it was quicker for me to walk to my destination than to catch a bus. Mind you I'm from Sheffield where the council still seems to regard buses as the transport of the future. Personally I think they're fine as long as you're not in a hurry to get anywhere - I pretty much travelled everywhere by bus when I was a kid and didn't mind it at all. OTOH if you want to get to work on time they're a bloody nuisance because they're invariably late or just fail to arrive.

The Tube's great, though not sure it would work so well in Sheffield because of the hills. London's relatively flat, Sheffield has elevation differences in the region of 100-200m between the city centre and the outskirts. Plus the council would fuck it up somehow because they're absolutely terrible at civil engineering and almost every large-scale project they've attempted for the past 20 years has cost more, and generated less, revenue than projected.
It might work in Manchester though - it's flatter for one thing and, though it pains me to say this, Manchester council don't seem to blunder around like Sheff council as much so they'd probably make a decent job of it.",null,0,null,1438587851,null,null,false,0,ctpp3gq,null,t3_3fjpb1,null,null,null,t3_3fjpb1,null,null,null,1440250138,null,3,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

null,null,AnalyticContinuation,null,null,null,"&gt; On 2 May 1986, the plume finally passed over parts of the UK and, with fateful timing, so too did a column of cloud carrying heavy rain. The rain fell hardest where it always falls hardest – on the uplands. As the droplets of water fell from the sky, they carried with them the radionuclides – in particular, caesium-137, iodine-131 and strontium-90 – that had been dispersed from Chernobyl. It is estimated that 1% of the radiation released from the reactor fell on the UK.

From [here](http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/dec/29/sheep-farmers-chernobyl-meat-restricted).

[Restrictions on Welsh and Cumbrian sheep farms](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-17472698) due to the Chernobyl incident (1986)  were finally lifted in 2012.

[Effect of fallout from Fukushima in GB](http://data.gov.uk/dataset/observations-of-fukushima-fallout-in-great-britain1)

So those incidents did affect the UK. In the case of Chernobyl quite seriously.

Although those *particular* issues will probably not happen again and not in the UK, the problem is that every incident is due to some different unique set of events which makes them very hard/impossible to predict. But when one does happen the severity is huge.

The thing is Calais is a massively complex situation.

null,null,theenglishguy72,null,null,null,"There are actually five foreign governments with a stake in the UK's train system.

Arriva is a subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn which is owned by the German government. It was originally a British company but was bought out in 2010. They run Chiltern Railways, Crosscountry, Arriva Trains Wales, Grand Central, Tyne &amp; Wear Metro and own 50% of London Overground.

The other 50% stake in London Overground is owned by MTR - which is majority owned by the Hong Kong government.

Abellio is a subsidiary of Nederlandse Spoorwegen which is owned by the Dutch government. It runs Abellio Greater Anglia and Scotrail as owns 50% of Northern Rail and Merseyrail.

Govia is 25% owned by SNCF, which is a subsidiary of the French government. They run Thameslink, London Midland, Southern and Southeastern. 

The UK's 40% percent stake in Eurostar has also been recently sold - 75% to the Canadian government owned Quebec Pension Fund (who also have a 10% stake in Govia).

The public sector often bloats workforces as getting rid of people is hard and costly and not what politicians want to hear. Tendering for contracts is a lot more expensive as there are numerous frameworks that must be adhered to to ensure fairness.

We may be a net contributor to the EU budget, but we definitely get a lot out of our EU membership that isn't counted by it's opponents. I guarantee that the City would collapse very quickly in the event of a Brexit.

Secondly, it would curtail the freedoms of British citizens to travel, live and work on the continent which, to be selfish, is something I quite like to do, as do many other Brits.

Thirdly it would greatly diminish our diplomatic standing in the world, jeopardise our alliance with the USA, and could be the wedge that forces us from the UNSC as we might not longer be seen as a global player. Cameron's isolationist foreign policy has won us no friends. You have to build alliances to get things done, and what an alliance the EU is.

Finally, purely as an ideological reason I think it is more important than ever for the West to present a united front on the world stage. Calais and the Mediterranean crisis won't disappear if we leave the EU. Migration won't stop, our economy won't suddenly take off, IS won't be defeated and all the constitutional and political reforms that Britain needs won't suddenly happen.

Only the Commission itself has said that they've got one term to make it start working or it'll be too late.  It's blatantly transparent that the current set up isn't working which is precisely why they're starting to call for new powers and more federalisation.

The Saudi state although they funded ISIS to begin with to deal with the Iraqi Shias have abandoned it after it started talking about about it's desire to take Mecca and overthrow what ISIS sees as a heretical monarchy (ISIS believe Monarchies are un islamic including and especially the house of Saud). ISIS has money coming in from private individuals in Saudi Arabia but get a lot of money from looted banks and illegal antiquities trading, as well as oil.

Nobody except for ISIS members and supporters really recognise ISIS as a Caliphate so calling it a reestablished Caliphate is a little bit like calling Sealand a state, nobody really calls it a state except for ISIS members. Even hardline Sunni Islamists like Al Qaeda reject ISIS, and that's saying something about a group that kill cartoonists and fly planes into buildings. They are a cult in the sense they believe a terrorist leader was chosen by God to be the Caliph and in how they operate as a group, controlling the lives, resources and behaviors of its members and the people under its control in lands that it's captured. As well as going for the Saudis it also believes that Shias are non Muslims and therefore have to Convert, pay an unaffordable fee or die. They'll go after Iran if we aren't careful and we will see an epic clusterfuck.

However, what I think will happen with ISIS is this: It will collapse eventually leaving an even more fucked up levant. The thing with ISIS is that it is a cult and a gang all rolled up into one. It's leader, Al-Baghdadi, is in poor health and once he dies which I think may be soon, the power vacuum will end up with internal struggles which will turn ISIS into a house of cards. That is, unless they suddenly decide to accept the parts of the Koran they reject (IE: most of the good stuff) and elect a new leader, but I think that's unlikely considering that IS is more like a terrorist gang than anything else.

The banks were renationalised under emergency rules (Brown had to get permission from the other 28 countries) with the strict proviso that they be privatised again once they were on their feet.

Basically renationalisation is incompatible with the EU.

If we round them all up:


European Commission - The candidates are chosen individually by the 28 national governments that every nation has elected to run their gov. Furthermore they each need a vote of approval that is required from the European Parliament(that you elected), and the Parliament has the power to dismiss them. They are responsible for proposing legislation but not voting it in. They are held accountable by European Court of Justice which is composed of 1 judge per country(they are not elected as far as I know but what judge is ever elected?)


Council of the European Union = is composed of 28 national ministers (one per state) and they change according to subject that is debated. Meaning that if you want to make some changes in agriculture you meed up with the 28 agricultural ministers of every country and talk it out what you want to do. They are not elected directly because that's how the democracy in your country works. You elect the parties which in turn make a goverment and they send a representative to the Council.

European Parliament = are directly elected by the population of each country


The last 2 institutions follow the same rule, 1 from each state chosen by your gov.


How is EU less democratic?


Also another question is why are people so up in arms about regulation. Why do you think we still have high quality agricultural produce? Isen't regulation made to protect the average joe from corporations that want to skip safety and diligence to make more profit? Why is that a bad thing? One example off the top of my head is banning at a EU level of certain light bulbs that were damaging the enviroment and were not very efficient. They created a new, better and cleaner industry that was initially more expensive than old light bulbs but now is comparable in price with the old models and cleaner/more efficient.

I believe you are not rightly informed on the matter. There a few more questionable statements you made but I just wanted to ask about the present and not about future maybe, if's,what would happen in case of this and that.

The emails turned out to be quite accurate on *some* points.  

&gt; The paper quoted Mr Blumenthal as telling Mrs Clinton - who is currently seeking the Democrat nomination to succeed Barack Obama in 2016 - that a Cameron government would be ""more aristocratic and even narrowly Etonian ... sharply contrasting especially with the striving and classless perspective of the grocer's daughter, Margaret Thatcher"".

This has turned out to be true.  Most of the Tory Cabinet come from privileged backgrounds and have consistently proven that they don't give a damn about the working class and poor.  ""Narrowly"" Etonian has proven to be an understatement.  

&gt; Mr Blumenthal, who was an aide to Bill Clinton during his time in the White House, said Mr Cameron's foreign policy was largely driven by his ""need to keep his party behind him"" on issues such as Europe.

Again, this has proven true.  Cameron's Europe policy is a mess because he is trying to please the Eurosceptics within his party.  

&gt; Other messages describe London mayor Boris Johnson as ""the Tory clown prince""...

This can hardly be denied either.  Johnson's charming clownish behaviour hides a deep ambition to be PM.

null,null,Carlswaen,null,null,null,"&gt;Firstly, it is not pragmatic or sensible to leave the EU, potentially costing our economy a lot of money. 

It seems an initial 0.5% to 1% boost in GDP is the more likely.

&gt; We may be a net contributor to the EU budget, but we definitely get a lot out of our EU membership that isn't counted by its opponents. 

It's 40 pence on the pound.   For every pound paid in we receive back 40p, but then there is the cost of implementation and excessive regulation and costs to our diminished fishing quota to include.

But in the purest sense of what we pay in and what we get back, it's 40p on the pound.

&gt; I guarantee that the City would collapse very quickly in the event of a Brexit.

Don't be silly.  Hedge fund management firms primarily support leaving the EU.  They're not saying it because they think the city's financial will collapse.

That's straight up fear mongering. 

&gt;Secondly, it diminishes the freedoms of British citizens to travel, live and work on the continent which, to be selfish, is something I quite like to do, as do many other Brits.

I don't just like to do it, I am doing it.      
The Vienna Convention's Law of Treaties means I have no fears about my position on leaving the EU.

&gt;Thirdly it greatly diminishes our diplomatic standing in the world, jeopardises our alliance with the USA, and could be the wedge that forces us from the UNSC as we might not longer be seen as a global player. 

By giving up on a prospect of joint foreign policy, a joint military, a joint diplomatic service, all proposed under federalism, it diminishes our standing?  No that's the EU because we wouldn't have a UK missions or policy.  As it is the UK is a world leader in soft-diplomacy but it's hindered by the EU, not aided by it.

There's also absolutely nothing stopping us from contributing to mutual defence outside the EU via NATO or as both Norway and Turkey also do through the EU battlegroups.

&gt;I think it is more important than ever for the West to present a united front on the world stage.

But the EU isn't united.   

It's actively created a North-South rift in the EU where one previously didn't exist.  The Greeks weren't burning effigies of German leaders before this, and there's potentially far larger powder kegs in Southern Italy and Spain soon to come similarly to the fore.

The Mezzogiorno is set to be much worse than the Greek crisis and it promises to drag the north with it.

&gt;I'm a little biased here, as I'm currently travelling in Europe and am sitting on a platform in Vienna Hbf. waiting for a train to Brno,

You could still do that outside the EU...

&gt;but I'm a proud European as much as I am an Englishman or Brit.

And a lot of people aren't, but history does show what happens when one set of people try to force their identities or nationalities on someone else and it's not pretty.

**1. Grading and degree classes**

Percentage grading is used. This translates to degree classes as follows: first (70%+), upper second (60-70%), lower second (50-60%), third (40-50%). Unless you opt to produce a thesis (relatively rare), your degree class in E&amp;M will be entirely determined by your performance in your final exams at the end of 3rd year. There are usually 8 of these final exams, one for each of the modules you will have studied over the previous two years.

Examiner's reports are published yearly and provide data on overall exam performance (as well as performance on individual papers) for that graduating class. For the most current numbers, get your hands on the Examiner's Report for E&amp;M 2013-14 or 2014-15. The report is only available to those with student credentials, but if you ask on something like [TSR](http://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/) I'm sure someone can procure it for you. 

For the sake of illustration, here's what it looked like running up to 2012:

 | 2011/2012 | 2011/2010 | 2010/2009 | 2009/2008
---|---|----|----|----
1 | 25.3% | 21% | 18.2% | 17.4%
2:1 | 61.5% | 76.5% | 77.3% | 76.7%
2:2 | 12.1% | 2.5% | 4.5% | 5.8%
3 | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0%

You'll notice the high proportion of 1s - this is a matter of some controversy and is partially based on a rule that allowed you to claim a 1 if your weighted average results are above ~68% instead of 70%. I think they ended up changing the rule in 2013 or 2014 so I'd expect the current proportion to be lower. 

**2. Exams**

As I mentioned above, you would usually take 8 exams in your third year. These would comprise:

a. Three exams in the compulsory modules: macroeconomics, microeconomics and 'quantitative economics' (this is a math paper covering stats, probabilities, etc)

b. Five exams covering your choice of optional modules. There are a bunch of these available - here, have a massive list of 'em from 2012:

* Microeconomic Theory 
* Money and Banking 
* Public Economics 
* Economics of Industry 
* Labour Economics and Industrial Relations
* International Economics
* Command and Transitional Economies
* Economics of Developing Countries
* British Economic History since 1870
* Econometrics
* Comparative Demographic Systems
* Economics of OECD Countries
* Game Theory 
* Mathematical Methods 
* Accounting 
* Organizational Behaviour and Employment Relations 
* Finance 
* Strategic Management 
* Marketing
* Technology and Operations Management

A few of these exams are problem set-based (e.g. math methods), a few more combine problem sets and essays (e.g. finance, micro, game theory, industrial econ...), and the vast majority are essay-based. Not sure what you mean by ""memorization"" - obviously you are expected to know the literature on each topic and be able to cite scholarship that supports your argument, but the actual questions asked can vary substantially year to year.

**3. Workload**

Oxford is one of those places where it really is down to you how much you choose to get out of it. Generally you would be taking two modules per term. Each module involves: 2-4 hrs of lectures per week, a weekly reading list (typically 2-3 textbook chapters and 10-15 papers on a topic) and a 1-2 hr 'tutorial' with your prof (a discussion based class, usually held for 2-3 students at a time - though some subjects use larger group sizes). You will usually be expected to prepare an essay / problem set for discussion. 

As you can see, the actual number of contact hours is very low (probably 6/week on average). You can skate by in tutorials on a few textbook chapters and a prayer (though it will unfortunately show!), or you can work 80 hrs a week on reading everything you can get your hands on - it's really down to you. Typically workload waxes and wanes over the course of people's degrees as they get more or less involved in extra-curriculars (+ quality of the teaching, aptitude for the particular subject, etc obviously) - I remember working anything from 20 to 70 hrs a week.

The last two terms of third year are pretty much entirely dedicated to revision. This is when people and workloads get crazy. 



     
     

**To wrap up:** It genuinely is a really interesting degree. The college system is great fun, there's a hell of a lot of stuff to get involved in, and you'll have privileged access to world experts on some of the topics you study. Two caveats:

* Do bear in mind that the teaching of economics in Oxford is more focused on getting you to understand the conceptual functioning of the various models than it is their detailed mathematical mechanics - for something like that you'd be better off (in the UK at least) at Cambridge or the LSE. 
* If you are a procrastinator - and I speak as one - you will suffer. There will be no one behind you to monitor how much you're actually learning, so it's on you not to fuck up.

* Roughly 20% get a 1st, the vast majority get a 2:1, maybe 5% get a 2:2 and very occasionally someone gets a 3rd. It's not graded on a curve, but I believe they do occasionally make adjustments if particular exams are unusually hard/easy.
* The website will have the most up to date information, but exams are usually closed book, so you'll have to memorize a lot. Some courses have the option to replace an exam with a piece of coursework. Exam season is pretty brutal, about 2-3 weeks of exams every couple of days. You'll also be tested at the start of every term more informally on the previous term's work.
* Workload is highly variable. Compared to most UK universities there's a lot of reading and essays/problem sets; typically 2 a week. However, lectures are mostly optional, there are long holidays (although you're expected to study through part of these) and people find time for many extracurricular activities. If you want a 1st, however, you're going to have to work extremely hard all the way through. And for the 4 months before exams, everyone is working as hard as they can.

The Telegraph's foreign affairs correspondent puts it at around a third, whilst noting that Norway outside the EU has neither no say in, nor needs to implement any agriculture, fishing, justice, or home affairs regulation.

The Norwegian No campaign actually puts the total figure when looking at all regulation, laws and directives the EU passes and how much Norway then has to adopt as much, much lower at 9.05% with a  Morten Harper study.  It showed Norway having adopted 4,724 regulations, directives and legislation acts between 2010 and 2013 out of a whopping total of  52,183 passed at an EU level over the same period.  Some regulations expire but even counting those in force whilst discounting those at an EU level that have only been enacted still only brings the figure to around 15%.

But it's all distraction anyway because next to nobody is advocating the Norwegian based EEA model precisely because it doesn't provide permanent immigration controls.  When the IEA ran their 2014 Brexit prize not a single EEA proposal made the shortlist.  They were all either EFTA or FTA based.

The Conservatives return to office and privatise again - and use the proceeds give a massive bung to the higher rate taxpayers in the form of a cut. People are delighted and vote them in again.

This is essentially what the Thatcher govt did. She didn't pay for her tax cuts through reducing spending. She paid for it by asset sales. Strictly speaking asset sales should be used to pay down debt - so if you sell your house, you pay off the mortgage on it. If you use it for spending, the money runs out but you've still got a debt. Essentially thats what she did - blew it all on tax cuts, bought herself three election victories - and then there was a spectacular bust in 1991 when the money ran out but the debt still loomed.

So any Labour govt deciding to spend money like this would be essentially funding the tax cuts of the next Tory govt.

&gt; Wages: £1.49bn

&gt; Transfers: £642.3m (net £510.1m)

&gt; Training ground: £20m

The issue with using club spending is because as I said above, a lot of that spending comes from the club's own bank account.

The article uses Deloitte's Annual Review of Football Finance as its source (from 2013), so [here is a copy of the most recent one, 2015](http://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/press-releases/articles/annual-review-of-football-finance-2015.html).

The relevant text:

&gt;Total owner investment at both Chelsea and Manchester City topped £1 billion at each club since their respective takeovers;

Unfortunately we can't get a breakdown, but what is interesting is that both owners passed the £1bn mark in the same year despite City being bought in 2008, 5 years later than Abramovich. They have spent at a rate twice that of Chelsea. Around £200m of that is [on their Training Complex](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30376774)

So how have they performed since their respective takeovers?

Team | Premier League | FA Cup | League Cup | Champions League | Europa League
---|---|----|----|----|----
Chelsea | 4 | 4 | 3 | 1 | 1
Manchester City | 2 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0

Sergio Aguero, the man is the best striker in the world at the moment along with FC Barcelona's Luis Suarez. Also he won us the league in extra time, check that out.

A close second is David Silva; one of the best creative midfielders in the world, also known as the magician.

&gt;Who's A fan favourite

Zabaleta. Not only is he one of the best RB in the league but he is a fighter; never goes down easy and risks his body for the team, you'll see him with blood running down his face and with a bandage quite often.

You might not care, but Cilla Black dying _is_ newsworthy to a lot of people. I was out with a big group of people _of a certain age_ yesterday, and they were visibly shocked by her death, for quite some time.

I don't care either. But don't think that because you feel it isn't newsworthy that suddenly the news is dumb. For a very many people, it's the biggest story of the day. The news should of course cover things people _should_ know about - but it also covers things people _want_ to know about, and this is very firmly in that category.

[edit] Also worth mentioning her death is the top upvoted story in this very subreddit over the past 7 days by a huge margin. So perhaps it's more newsworthy than you're giving it credit for.

They had seen what their colonisation was doing to the other worlds around their star, and they were horrified.  They recoiled at their own meddling and refuse.  It took hundreds of years, but they rehabilitated the worlds they had colonised, and withdrew.

The last of the technologies they gave up were biological.  They held onto them for the sake of medicine, but a few wanted to go just a little further before they gave up on technology completely.  In the great restored forests of Nera, the Nerada created new life, companions to ensure that even after they gave up their last technologies, they would never again have to fear what might be hiding behind those great trees.

The Nerada created creatures, motes of living shadow, that would be attracted to beasts hiding behind trees, and would warn the Nerada telepathically.  But the shadows proved too effective a hunting ground, and soon the creatures began to prey on their own creators.  The Nerada word for ""shadow"" was ""Vashta"", but soon there were no Nerada left to speak it.  

The worlds the Nerada had contacted in the past were curious, and they came one by one to see the great restored forest and find out what had become of the noble and just Nerada.  They left with ships full of living Nerada shadows.

You can be outside the EU and still be members of the likes of the Erasmus programme (Latin America), the Horizon 2020 programme (Canada and Israel), or even contribute to the European battlegroups (Norway and Turkey.)   

We don't really need a country as a model in the sense people talk about a Norwegian option or a Swiss option.  There'd be a UK option if we did go down the EFTA route, with Switzerland having fashioned its own bilaterals.  I think people just call it the 'Swiss Option' as it is easier describe, but in using the same EFTA model we don't have to end up with a Swiss solution.

That said I do favour the simple FTA solution, and possibly looking to put ourselves before the curve as observed by the WTO, as Singapore has done, and voluntarily removing all tariffs.

Then, as Rory Broomfield director of The Freedom Association and Better Off Out campaign has argued, the potential for revisiting a global free trade agreement

It's always a terrible idea to start a fight because someone could end up arrested, injured or dead and that someone could be you.  The person you attack could have a knife or a broken bottle, or six drunk mates nearby, or they could have a thin skull or a cerebral aneurysm waiting for that one unlucky punch.  This happens to people your age.  If you learn one thing from this experience, it should be that.

On to what you did, if there were no marks or bruises it will proabably be treated as common assault.  The police haven't called yet because they have bigger things to worry about, but since a complaint has been made they will follow it up and at least try to make contact with your parents.  They will probably be able to find out where you live without too much difficulty, you'll also be on the electoral register and if that fails they can call all the local schools or ask the person who complained for more details.  It is possible that they simply don't have enough information to find you, but I wouldn't count on it.

The consquences for a first time offence will probably be 'words of advice' or a stern talking to.  It may happen at home or at the police station, but your parents will be present.  You may want to get in beforehand and let them know what is going on as they are either going to hear it from you or in a phone call from the police.

Take my second eldest daughter.  She has just finished primary and achieved 5 for English and 6 for Maths.  She has already been streamed for top sets with in her year group before she starts secondary.  My oldest who is Y10 has stayed in top sets since she started and is often pushed past the curriculum when she easily achieves the work.  By contrast, my youngest is struggling in Y2, in the lower groups and getting help because she needs it.   My guess is that by Y3 she will start to move up the sets as she is probably the brightest of them all when she decides to apply herself.

My point is that your potential in life should not be assessed at 11.  We already have a system of helping thick kids and bright kids with in a single school, so why put the specter of predicted failure in front of kids - give them the possibility to develop at their own pace and realise that they can achieve more rather than stamp ""factory fodder"" on their foreheads as soon as we can.

Mikel does his job fantastically. I don't give a shit if he ""doesn't contribute going forward"" because that isn't his job. He sits back, breaks up the oppositions play and, when we're winning, is excellent to have on the pitch to slow the game down and maintain control of the game.

Also the Chinese education system doesn't work so well for the kind of workers we want to produce. Most systems like that are moving towards a freer system like ours to encourage creativity. 

You're right about parental attitudes here and the problems we have, but that's because we've moved past Victorian education (or had until Gove came along) and are trying to teach much harder skills. Rote learning like the Chinese is pointless in the age of Google. 

The fact is that education doesn't mean a better life here on the whole. Even going to uni isn't that guarantee any more. And yes, there's a problem with parents not realising the world has changed and a life time job in a factory doesn't exist any more. 

Tl;dr: we teach by consent because it's required at this stage of Blooms Taxonomy. That's a much harder job. Not to say there aren't massive issues around attitudes to education.

It's where almost all the money in our financial system comes from.  We have a private, credit based money system in which new money is generated when banks make loans to credit worthy borrowers (from a balance sheet perspective both an asset and a liability is generated in the process so it nets out).  A lot of people are horrified by this, but this isn't some evil machiavellian scheme by the banks, it's just people taking out mortgages and loans at boring retail banks.  The thinking behind this system is basically that retail banks have to have very strict criteria when choosing who to lend to, because if you end up lending to someone with a dodgy credit history then you're liable to lose money.  In theory this is better than, say, government having control of the money supply, since there won't be political pressure to try to increase it or decrease it, and instead the money supply is goverened by risk accounting and the number of credit worthy borrowers.",null,0,null,1438597279,null,null,false,0,ctprctl,null,t3_3figmy,null,null,null,t1_ctp4cdj,null,null,null,1440251203,null,2,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Since 2001, the proportion of homes rented privately has rocketed by 69 per cent. As more and more households are forced into private renting, increased demand will put greater pressure on the rental market. This will push up prices and drive down conditions – leaving renters even worse off.

The proportion of those claiming housing benefit who are in employment has doubled from 11% in November 2008 to 22.5% in February 2014. The total housing benefit bill in England – accounting for inflation – has risen by almost 150% from £8.7bn to £21.5bn in 21 years.

According to Shelter, one in five families in England now rents privately, unlike renting in the social housing sector, most private rental properties are let out at market rates, meaning they are likely to be more expensive. They’re also likely to be let out on short term contracts of 6-12 months, with the landlord able to evict a tenant with only two month's notice.

Private renters are disproportionately represented in those who come to Shelter for housing advice
Over a third of private rented homes fail to meet the Decent Homes Standard
In 1 in 4 areas, rents increased by an average of £300 a year in 2012
There were more than 85,000 complaints about rogue landlords in 2012.

null,null,the_ultravixens,null,null,null,"One thing that is rarely touched on in the ""why are British houses so expensive"" debate is the lack of safe savings instruments for people to invest their savings into.  Government deficits were quite low, or indeed were surpluses, during the period when house prices in the UK really shot up.  This meant that there was a lack of safe interest bearing government debt for people to purchase as a savings vehicle.  The UK also has no savings banks by contrast with somewhere like Germany, which has many of these called sparkassen, which invest peoples savings in local businesses and deposits with which are guaranteed by the government.

So, with a lack of safe government debt or savings banks to invest in, people are instead investing their money in their properties.  This has had the twin undesirable effects of helping to push up house prices (again, I contend that there is an inverse caustative relationship between government deficit and house prices) and making it so that the government basically has to guarantee the housing market stays inflated, because a drop in the housing market also has the unpleasant side effect of destroying *loads* of private sector wealth, and probably leading to a financial crisis.  When you look at it through this lens, the utterly *insane* housing policies of George Osborne become at least somewhat explicable.

Lots of people are arguing for a big increase in housing supply, but that's what happened in Ireland and the resulting crash in housing prices ended up bankrupting a lot of construction companies, who borrowed against future earnings and then lost everything when the market prices went down.

We're basically in a real shitter of a situation.  We can't force down house prices without risking a financial crisis, we seemingly can't force up wages to make houses more affordable, but the fact is that housing is getting to the limits of affordability for lots of people.

null,null,blindlucky,null,null,null,"It kinda boils down to the question of what is news? Stuff you should know? Stuff you want to know? Stuff that has happened? Stuff that *will* happen? Stuff people are talking about?

Used to be news was stuff of 'importance' that had happened. BBC once famously decided that [nothing had happened one day in the 1930s](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p010szlg), however [the coverage of King Edward](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2707571.stm) shows maybe the question of 'importance' needs defining.

I remeber news from the 90s as being more 'stuff you should know'. I was a young student at the time, but news was informative if not overly 'interesting'. But there was less channels to watch, no web to surf. If I wanted to know what was happening I'd flip on the news at 6ish/10ish or something. Increasingly it turned into ""Stuff that happened"" (important or not), and slowly ""Stuff that will happen"" as papers tried to compete with TV's instant reporting system.

Now we have the internet, smart phones and digital channels up the wazzo. I can find out 'news' easily and fast, or just see what's trending on reddit. I know friends who never watch a news (and rarely read anything 'newsy' not shared via FB) because 'it's boring'. Always seem to know the latest celeb/footballing gossip though because they seek that out. Which is easy to do; I tend to look at the political stories and tech stuff myself, might read the headline of a bombing in [somewhere] but don't often click to *read* it...

So to get the viewers/readers/listeners, news has change to a ""Stuff people want to know"" and a ""Stuff people are talking about"" (Which merge somewhere, as people want to know what people are talking about).

its a pretty gross misrepresentation to suggest it is that.

what we have now - across the country as a whole - is not working particularly brilliantly - especially with respect to getting poorer kids better educated. its interesting to see that you yourself use language like 'thick kids' - pretty hypocritical? 

&gt; give them the possibility to develop at their own pace

yes of course some kids should be educated like that - grammar schools do not prevent that

&gt; rather than stamp ""factory fodder"" on their foreheads as soon as we can

gross misrepresentation of the suggested grammar system

&gt; Why take away the possibility that they might do better by sending them to a school that has already labeled them as failures

It always boils down to this - you would rather hold back hundreds of thousands of (often poorer) kids from getting their full potential than deal with the reality of life at 11 years old. And by dealing with the reality I mean finding more appropriate ways to educate kids that haven't demonstrated particularly academic abilities at 11 - there is clearly still lots of potential in them, but its misguided to bring the level of education down to lowest common denominator.

We are desperately short in the middle of the park, for the majority of games where we dictate possession and tempo,  Fabregas sitting with Matic is perfect, we get ample defensive cover but also Fabregas can control the game from deep.

In the big games however we simply get overrun, Ramires offers excellent defensive cover on the wings, but isn't good enough on the ball to play the holding role, and Fabregas isn't defensive minded enough or mobile enough to offer the tenacity you need against the likes of City, Arsenal, United, PSG, Barca etc. 

The obvious example is the 2 games against PSG where we were utterly dominated in the middle of the park, Mourihno even tried dropping Oscar deeper to regain control of the ball, but to no avail.
What we desperately need is another ball playing midfielder, someone who is creative and cultured enough in possession so that against lesser teams he can help breakdown defences, but in big games can put in a defensive effort to win back the ball, break up attacks and launch our own counters. I think someone like Witsel, Cabaye, Schweinsteiger would have been perfect.


Mikel infuriates me, he got such an imposing frame but seems incapable of using it, I genuinely challenge any Mikel fans on here to find me a picture of him at the end of a game sweating, muddy or just generally looking like he'd put a big shift in, it'll be almost impossible. 

When it comes to the biggest matches of our season I worry about our ability to control a game, the impact of which is players like Hazard, Oscar, Willian can only ever get on the ball in our own half.

**About Benteke**
&gt;For me, he's a great signing. We didn’t score as many as we'd like last season, so he's a great addition to the squad.

&gt;He could be the difference between fourth and fifth, that's how good he was for Aston Villa.

&gt;Brendan (Rodgers) will be looking at different options, different styles of play, and Benteke comes in to that. It's now about how the new players gel with him, but he'll certainly be given a great chance to prove what he can do.

&gt;I think Benteke will help the midfielders, he'll give Henderson, Coutinho, Milner, Firmino a chance to play.

**About top 4 chances**

&gt;It's going to be hard, but the aim is top four of course. Arsenal look very strong, Chelsea are always strong, the two Manchester clubs, and it's going to be very tight. But I think the signings we've made, there's a good possibility we could finish in the top four.

&gt;I'm very impressed with the signings, I'm happy the owners have given Brendan money to do that, and that we've got them early. Sometimes you go in late, but he's got them in early, most have been on pre-season and have bonded.

&gt;Two years ago we were scoring goals and letting goals in. Last season we kept 14 clean sheets, so we kept a clean sheet but were not scoring.

&gt;This season we need to score more goals and continue keeping them out. He's made changes and everyone is fighting for their place now.

Yet I failed my 11 plus and went to a high school where university wasn't even mentioned to us. I thought (in the early 90's!) that to go to uni, you had to be either an aristocrat or a child prodigy. The realities of higher education were simply unknown in my working class rural community. I did badly at school thanks to bullying and frankly, crap teachers with low expectations. It wasn't until I had left school and was languishing in menial work that I started to develop my intellect and crucially, my self-confidence.

The idea of putting a child's hope of social mobility on a single test taken at age 11 is like something out of the Hunger Games. People develop at different rates, and schools are not infallible when it comes to determining a child's abilities (I speak from experience). The only fair system is to provide lifelong educational opportunities. Streaming can only be fair when a person can ""re-stream"" themselves at any time in their life.

In fact I started compiling a list (There are hundreds of results if you google ""Obama snubs UK"") but there's already a fairly extensive one here: http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/president-obamas-biggest-british-gaffes/article/2503321

My impression is that he has tried to be more even handed in foreign policy - i.e. not show as much favoritism towards certain countries (particularly the UK and Isreal) as previous administrations, and has tried to be more friendly with some of America's traditional enemies (notably Cuba, Russia, China and Iran). As a result he has royally pissed off the UK government several times, and Isreal is furious with him. He's made absolutely no progress with Russia, some progress with Iran but looks like he's cracked the Cuba stalemate at least. The China situation is complex and I don't really know if he's made much progress there, but it is notable that Japan has gotten a *lot* more aggressive recently, and have been re-gearing their military away from being strictly a self defence force. If I had to guess, I'd put that down to America's more constructive stance towards China (which you may know hates Japan and vice versa), and as a result Japan no longer feels that America is quite so much on their side.

Overall I think Obama's greatest problem is that he has tried to be everyone's friend, and hasn't figured out that in global diplomacy where there are existing hegemonies and power blocks, you really have to pick your friends and stick with them.

I'm going to stop reading now.

Did the TPA report mention average lifetime earnings over the same period? (Edit: yes)  
Or what they reckon the lifetime tax spend _should_ be? £600k? £400k? (Edit: no)

**Edit**  

[Direct link](https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/taxpayersalliance/pages/5600/attachments/original/1438179699/Total_Lifetime_Tax_2015.pdf) to the report (PDF)

Their methodology is to take figures for 2013/14 and multiply by 40, plus ""a retired household’s total direct and indirect taxes"" x 15 years.  
I don't have a handy figure for average annual pension, so taking just the 40-year working life:  
Earnings: £39,200 x 40 = £1,568,000  
Tax: £15,812 x 40 = £632,480

That gives an average tax rate of 40%. That seems high when we're used to hearing about income tax rates, but it includes VAT, NICs and Council Tax. Honestly, it doesn't sound so bad.

**Edit #2**  
Probably not their intention, but the report shows that the poorest quintile pays a higher rate of tax (21.9%) than the richest (17.8%).  
It also shows that the rise in tax since the previous year is greater for the poorest quintile (4.1%) than for the richest (2.2%).",null,0,null,1438601670,null,null,1438604074,0,ctpsghh,null,t3_3flsx9,null,null,null,t3_3flsx9,null,null,null,1440251722,null,5,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

null,null,stubble,null,London Arab,null,"&gt; only cite Jews being guilty of this seems very odd.

Guilty? I don't recall even suggesting there was any blame to be allocated.

My choice of the Jewish community as a point of reference was due its success and longevity as a UK minority culture. Jews are in integral part of UK business, political and social life but retain a very strong sense of identity and cultural values. Whether in marriage, dietary laws, social preferences the Jewish community is very identifiable but also tightly integrated and also very proud of its identity. That's in spite of massive anti-Semitism upon their initial arrival en masse (late 1890s as pogrom escapees). I think their example is proof that a hybrid position can exist where you can become a key part of the dominant culture without necessarily needing to shed any of your own cultural practices. 

&gt;Why have you made the assumption that I'm 12 years old? 

Considering where we are there is a greater likelihood you are nearer your teens than I am - we need some sort of ageing band in here really. Someone called me a student earlier.. :)

&gt;cite the Jews as the most isolated community in the UK 

I think you have complete misread my comment regarding the Jewish community. Members of my own community meet with them regularly to get advice and assistance from a group that has more experience of living in the UK than we do (collectively speaking). 

&gt;Also, do you ever see a time, given that you've been here since at least '81, that you might change your flair from ""London Arab"" to just ""Londoner"", or will you always be determined to see the division between people?

I've been here since the early 60s and am proud of my Arab heritage. I am not a Londoner; nor have I always lived in London. If I count the number of cities I've lived in over the past 30 years it's a lot. Some were cool, some sucked balls. London remains my preferred choice of home - currently since 2004 - because it is an exciting International City and, at its core, very tolerant to all cultures that reside here.

You don't let go of an identity simply because you've been somewhere for a long time. I speak Arabic with my family and friends, (oh and Hebrew with my Israeli and Jewish friends, they appreciate my fluency).  My daughter on the other hand has very little resonance with any Arab roots other than the fact that her grandfather is very dark and has a funny accent.

Far from seeing this as divisive, this for me is by far one of the most interesting aspects of living in the UK, well London anyhow. Pride in one's heritage, which I expect is something you also feel, is not limited to a location you happen to be living in. I come from a culture with a  long and fascinating history with both high points and low points. Maybe this is where you miss the point of what a truly multicultural society can become. The dominant culture inevitably absorbs aspects of the minorities who live among them. The flow is and should be encouraged to be two way. Both sides benefit from the new sets of relationships that are potentially created by these points of connection.

&gt;My point is that slow and gentle immigration is a wonderful thing

And herein lies the problem. When people flee atrocities, pogroms, wars, ethnic cleansing, whatever the cause of mass movement, you can't turn this into a slow trickle. The UK is quick to join coalitions to bomb bad guys in the Middle East but as soon as the inevitable refugee crisis lands on its shores then it's 'sorry mate, we're full'. If you are going to be an International player then it has to extend a little beyond fighter jets and smart bombs sometimes.

I think the issue when it comes to add-ons though is that people simply don't look into it enough.

I don't think its emphasis on rote-learning, relentlessness and purely teaching to pass exams produces well-rounded individuals of good character with the skills for living and working in the 21st century as well as ours does. 

I've met EFL teachers who have worked in East Asia who are very critical of how education is delivered over there. One teacher I knew who taught in S Korea described it as ""borderline childabuse"" and said that kids would be working 10 hour days and running on 4-5 hours of sleep. Evidently its not healthy at all, and I don't think its allowing these adolescents to develop as well-rounded individuals- instead you're making them into robots designed to pass exams.

What I think we can take from Chinese, or in general East Asian culture, is the very positive attitude that they have towards education and their respect for teachers in the classroom. We in the UK need to find a way to bring back respect for teachers and for education itself that they have in China. We also need to find the right balance between freedom and discipline in the classroom, and I feel we've lurched too far towards the freedom side of the scale.

The main problem i've been finding having worked as a classroom cover supervisor is that most of your attention in the classroom is directed towards the disruptive and under performing students, so your efforts as a teacher I believe are focused on pulling up the under-performers and this comes at the expense of focusing on developing the regular students and pushing the boundaries of their capabilities. We're not getting the most out of our students because of the disruptive minority in every classroom.

null,null,decemberwolf,null,null,null,"&gt; You blame the DM and then get shirty with someone who calls you out on it as nonsense? I'd be impressed, were it not for the fact that you RES tag people you disagree with as a troll. People are allowed to disagree. Grow up.

I'm not calling him a troll for disagreeing, I'm calling him one for the way he conducts his discussions. It isn't the first time either.

&gt; You're not exactly doing these people a service are you? You assume that they have the internet and are able to read the DM saying they'll all get million pound houses. Surely they are smart enough to a) not believe that, and b) find other news sources which show how crappy Britain is in other regards. But you seem to think that they're dimwits who grab a rucksack at the first sign of a 'too good to be true'-ism and make for Tower Hamlets? How very patronising.

Why would they not believe it? Why would a foreigner believe that the press here would lie about it, considering the context it is framed in. How many western people check multiple sources? Why are you expecting so much critical thinking from a refugee, who is more likely to cling to a desperate dream due to their circumstances?

&gt; They don't come here expecting millions, they come here expecting a better life. They understand that there's a welfare state which will prop them up until they get on their feet, and that their kids will be educated to a high standard. They're not stupid.

And how did they come to find out about that if not for the constant news propaganda we have seen in the past 5 years which slanders the benefits system and the 'outrageous' amount of scrounging apparently happening. As you said, they aren't stupid and this sort of news will reach them

&gt; The difference, as has already been pointed out by ""the troll"" is that our welfare system is open to abuse much more quickly and easily than other countries. If we stopped giving benefits to migrants (like in Germany) then they'd be less gung-ho about coming here. There wouldn't be a system to prop them up.

Are you conflating asylum seekers, illegal immigrants and normal migrants together here? Germany certainly does house and give benefits to asylum seekers and neither country offers anything to illegal immigrants. So what if germany doesn't offer benefits to migrants. Nor do we for a good few years. Hell, my wife has been working here for 7 years and still isn't entitled to anything other than NI based jobseekers.

&gt; But to blame it on the DM, or to assume that it's any news source saying that they'll be living in palatial residences, 

You know blame isn't a zero sum game, right? As in, I can quite easily blame the DM and propaganda for being part of the problem without it removing blame from other sources of the problem. 

&gt; while you sit there in your intellectual superiority, in ""your obsession with being smarter than everyone"" who reads the DM, is pretty sad.

the DM is a national joke of a paper. If you read it and take it seriously, you have issues with your critical thinking. I don't have to be smarter than anyone not to read the DM, you have to be significantly sheltered and culturally unaware to read the DM and take it as anything but a truckload of blatant propaganda.

Should also note that a large amount of the research suggesting cannabis causes physcosis is decades old, with more recent studies suggesting the opposite.

null,null,ScoutingGod,lfc99,,null,"My opinion of defending is that a defence can only be so solid as a 3 or 4. Chelsea got a lot of praise last season for having a solid defence, but if you look at their back 4 as individuals they all have big weaknesses. 

- Terry - Lost a lot of pace, if you have a quick striker running at/past him you fancy your chances 7/10 times.
- Cahill - Made a few mistakes last year, some with Chelsea but some with England too. 
- Azpili(Dave) - Natural right back playing left-back. 
- Ivanovic - Losing pace to cover


So each of them have weaknesses, and they could be exploited, but what makes them seem more solid is the players in front of them. Matic is probably the best DM in the Prem at least. The fact is he absorbs so much pressure that no matter who's behind him, they're going to have less work to do themselves. 

Same with Saints. Wanyama/Schneiderlin took the brunt of everything, which is why Southampton made Lovren look better than he is. Now compare this with us and Spurs, who conceded 5 more goals than us last season, who's their best DM? Paulinho was sold to China, Stambouli to PSG, Mason is more box to box and Bentaleb is decent but can't do enough on his own. 

It even works with teams lower down the league with average players. Sunderland with Cattermole conceded less than the 2 teams that finished above them. The importance of a DM is clear for everyone to see, but BR ""doesn't like playing with one"" so we just have to deal with the fact that our defence is going to be exposed more than the teams around us, and we're simply going to have to outscore them.

Having said that, I completely agree that fares are too high, but the way the system is set up it is hard for the Mayor of London to increase the subsidy above £500m.

null,null,burgleurgle,null,null,null,"&gt;How would you nationalise these things?

There are three components we need to nationalise if we want complete renationalisation of the railways: 1) railway infrastructure, 2) train operations, and 3) train ownership.

1) Railway infrastructure (tracks, signals, stations etc) are already nationalised because they are owned by Network Rail, a publicly-owned company, so that's already taken care of.

2) Train operations are currently done by [train operating companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Train_operating_company) (TOCs). TOCs are awarded time-limited franchises by the government to operate trains on specified routes, so to renationalise train operations we simply need to wait until the current franchises have expired and replace the current, private, operators with a public operator. Train operations can thus be renationalised at zero cost, it just takes a bit of time.

3) Train ownership is the more difficult, and often overlooked, aspect. When British Rail was privatised its rolling stock (carriages, locomotives etc) was sold to a group of private companies called [rolling stock operating companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport_in_Great_Britain#Leasing_services) (ROSCOs). The ROSCOs lease the rolling stock to the TOCs. Because the ROSCOs own the rolling stock outright, in order to achieve full renationalistion we'd need to either buy the rolling stock off them or buy completely new rolling stock. Either option will be extremely expensive.

&gt;is not illegal under EU directive for the state to have a near or absolute monopoly on rail?

Sort of. You're referring to the EU's [First Railway Directive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Railway_Directive) which states that EU countries must allow open access operations on railway lines by companies *other than those that own the rail infrastructure*.

That last but, which I put in italics, is important. It basically means that a country can satisfy the directive by having one company managing the infrastructure and another, separate, company operating the trains. There is nothing stopping both of these companies being publicly-owned though.


&gt;should we not aim to achieve a more Japanese rail industry with a greater amount of competition

Japan is rather interesting in that it has arguably the world's best railways, and most of their railways are also privately owned and run (Japan thus shows that privately-run rail *can* work, although why theirs does and our doesn't is another discussion).

I presume that by competition you're referring to the fact that some areas in Japan are served by multiple rail companies, and thus passengers can choose which company to travel with?

Firstly, this is true for Japan's biggest cities, but for most other places in Japan you're stuck with one train company.

Secondly, in places where there is competition, there are reasons that it exists which would be hard to replicate in the UK:

1: Declining newspaper sales has meant that investigative journalism is no longer done by local reporters working for local newspapers- and rather than focusing on quality content, newspapers have had to focus on advertising and maximising revenue with sensationalist and dumbed-down reporting. 

2: 24 hour news and the lack of investigative reporting has meant that most national newspapers simply rely on news agencies like AFP and/or PR publications from thinktanks and businesses and then virtually copy/paste what they write and add their own spin to it. 

3: The poster was also very critical of Rupert Murdoch and the changes he's forced global media- He's certainly fostered this development of cheap, quick, easy and sensationalist news to maximise revenues. 

I'd also add that I think more people now get their news sources online for free and so don't buy newspapers. Newspapers may put their content online with advertising, but I think relying on online advertising revenue is far less profitable than newspaper readers are.

But this isn't the reality though is it.  Its a myth.  The main reason there was a move away from Grammer schools is that they exasperated the situation you describe rather than helped it.   There have been a load of studies done to support this view

[Gurney-Dixon Report (1954), “Early Leaving”](http://www.educationengland.org.uk/documents/gurneydixon/gurneydixon.html)

[Sutton Trust “Degrees of Success: University Chances by Individual School” 2011](http://www.suttontrust.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/sutton-trust-he-destination-report-final.pdf/)

[Sutton Trust ""Entry Into Grammar Schools Disadvantaged Pupils In England"" 2013](http://www.suttontrust.com/researcharchive/poor-grammar-entry-grammar-schools-disadvantaged-pupils-england/)

I think however, [this overview by the NUT](https://www.teachers.org.uk/edufacts/grammar-schools) shows that the people who actual educate our kids think of grammar schools as retrogressive.  I guess though, this depends on your point of view regarding ability, the inclusion of disadvantaged pupils.  Maybe the raw data from the Governments Grammar school statistics report might convince you [House of commons research briefing - pdf](http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN01398/SN01398.pdf)

&gt; its misguided to bring the level of education down to lowest common denominator.

I'm not sure where you got this idea from.  As I said, streaming is alive and well between the less and more able pupils in all year groups so currently all ability groups are catered for.  You don't need selective schools to segregate them unless you mean PMLD or perhaps CLDD cohorts.

Admittedly, what we have now isn't working very well, but according to practitioners, this is more due to policy and curriculum mismanagement rather than the loss the grammar school system.

Ok so Dover itself doesn't have the greatest restaurants, I'm afraid. There's some decent-ish places, but overall it's not the best, however I'll let you know where I would eat personally and if you're able to drive/get the train to other areas I'll give you my highlights. So onto Dover itself...

* O the seafront you have [Cullins Yard](http://www.cullinsyard.co.uk/), which is quite popular. However I've found the food a bit disappointing, to be honest. It's not as good as it used to be and the prices are a little steep, for the quality of the food. That being said, it's still ok and the decor is pretty cool, with old war artefacts and maritime bits hanging everywhere.

* [La Scala](http://www.lascalarestaurant.org.uk/) is a decent Italian, serving the usual Italian dishes. Fairly popular but quite small inside, should be ok for just turning up but worth booking if it's a weekend. 

* India House (no website I'm afraid) is my favourite Indian restaurant in Dover, of which I've tried quite a few. Never too busy and the food is always the same quality, can't really complain. It won't blow you away but for an Indian in Dover, it's my recommendation. 

* For pubs doing food, there aren't really any that I would suggest that are in the town, outside of the town in the neighbouring villages there are nice places to eat though. Again, let me know if you're driving and I'll give you some good places. 

* There are other places I haven't visited, but I've heard they're decent enough for meals. These are [The Allotment] (http://www.theallotmentdover.co.uk/) and Cinnamon Island (Indian/Fish restaurant).

The problem is discipline. If the students were actually taught the curriculum as is, they would be vastly more successful.

The comparison with China is not about the content of the curriculum, it is, as you point out, that the children are more likely to engage and want to learn - they are better incentivised.

It's a hard balance to strike, between having benefits that are fair to those who absolutely need them, but which aren't enough to pay for a more comfortable lifestyle than a minimum wage job would afford you. 

Personally I think aggressively increasing minimum wage is the way to go. It is, essentially, a cut in benefits in the long term, but in real terms it can be made to support those who rely on it, but won't be an incentive to those who just don't want to work.

As is the notion that they try to explain it away by saying republican terror of the last fifty years has made us this way. It is you're parents and your culture that made you this way. It is the anti popery propaganda of the 1600's passed from parent to child to this very day that makes you this way.

Basically, I’m a postgraduate student in Marketing at the University of Kent. For my dissertation I am hoping to explore attitudes towards British Army careers and the effectiveness, if any, of current British Army recruitment media, such as television adverts. 

As part of my research I’m conducting a short, 10-15 minutes survey seeking the opinions of those not currently serving in the British Army, but who are eligible to join. 

You must be **over 18** to participate, and, as per the regular army’s entry requirements, **no older than 32**. Since the survey is about gauging people’s responses to recruitment media, I ask that only individuals eligible to apply to the British Army, and those **NOT** currently serving, participate. The survey is completely anonymous. 

If you’ve got any questions, feel free to ask them on here. Thanks!

Getting skills, experience, or having a higher than average earnings compared to other countries which allows you to accrue capital and equity can be hard - but that's part of the reason for wanting to stay out of a currency union and leaving political union!    

The true mobiliser is personal wealth, upward mobility, and a stable society so you have time to develop skills.  And it just so happens the top 4 highest average earnings are all outside the EU, with the UK being 5th.

As it is 1.4 million non-EU nationals successfully emigrate to the EU each year, so it's not exactly tricky, but we shouldn't be looking to export our poor and those lacking skills anyway.  We should be looking to fix our social problems - and step one of that is taking control of our own labour market.

I am pretty sure I could have got a first but I had a really bad final year due to getting broken up with *and* having a close family member die. My lecturers all said I am definitely capable of a first so I am confident that I am capable of that standard of work. 

Would it be really worth delaying everything just to get a slightly higher 2:1, especially if we assume I do really well with my MA? I have individual pieces of work that were graded with really high marks, I think I can write a good application, have done relevant volunteering and interview reasonably well. Would getting a higher 2:1 really be important in any other situation than being identical to another candidate? Like if someone else hasn't got any relevant experience, interviews badly, etc but has a higher 2:1 would they get picked over someone who ticks all the other boxes?

Discretionary central banking is generally a bad idea, there's always short term gains to be found at the expense of longer term low levels of inflation, and such gains are normally not worth it. The BOE   would be too tempted to push growth above natural levels, leading to a loss of reputation and inflation problems.

&gt; “I was vehement that we wanted to stay in the public sector, and of course there were all the usual concerns trade unionists have regarding privatization, safety issues, job losses, protecting the conditions of service, and pensions. But accepting the will of Parliament, it was time to look at the arguments. So we said to management, ‘Well, if that’s what you want, this is what we want.’ Today I cannot argue against the private entrepreneur coming into the rail industry. We are running 1,700 more trains per day since it was privatized. The entrepreneurs built traffic to the extent that we are having to build more infrastructure. What is true is true: 4.2 billion pounds spent on new trains. We never saw that in all the years I’ve been in the rail industry. All the time it was in the public sector, all we got were cuts, cuts, cuts. And today there are more members in the trade union, more train drivers, and more trains running. The reality is that it worked, we’ve protected jobs, and we got more jobs. If a private company is making more money, I look at that from a union’s point of view, ‘Well, that looks like a wage increase to me.’ And we can argue that. And the more secure they are and the more productive they are in delivering train services, well, that means more jobs.

I dont think our midfield is defensively strong enough without Lucas in front of the defence. Unfortunately I could see us lining up without him but this is my ideal lineup with Firmino replacing Lallana once he's ready.  I do have a feeling that Henderson / Milner may be dropped a bit deeper with Lucas not starting,  and could play Lallana / Coutinho / Ibe in behind Benteke but that would be extremely risky since our defence would be extremely exposed.

Shows local authorities are failing to get poorer kids into grammar schools (the schools themselves has nothing to do with prep for entry). The problem you highlighted is not that the grammar system is bad (the schools do very well), but that the primary schools are failing to get the poorer kids into them. Exactly like that where I grew up where 2 near identical schools had radically different entry success because one had a head teacher who was ideologically apposed to them. The one kid I know from the crappy primary school that actually got in went on to being my richest friend - he was from a very poor household. This belief that the system is wrong is widespread amongst teachers but does not make it right - it is not a popular opinion for the teachers who actually work in them!

null,null,EverythingIsFine,null,null,null,"I mean our government debt bond market (Gilts). The UK is a country with monetary sovereignty, operating a fiat currency system. There is very little reason to actually ""borrow"" from the private sector. Doing so is really just for the creation of a market for the financial sector. What this allows is banks, hedge funds etc, to get access to literally the safest assets available, thus allowing them to alter their risk profile (hold a bunch of UK gov bonds which are very, very low risk, to offset the high risk of other assets - equities, derivatives, corporate bonds, foreign government bonds from countries that don't have monetary sovereignty, Eurozone countries for example, and so on).

The first point, is that banks also have access to the money supply direct from the central bank, at very low rates, so they can just carry that easy money over and buy our government bonds which pay more, albeit over a longer period. Easy money, for doing what exactly? The second point is that due to the nature of the risk our bonds carry (none), it gives them more freedom to go wild in the riskier more speculative assets, as their over all profile is reduced due to the low risk nature of government bonds. I don't really need to elaborate with what that has a tendency to result in, we all know.

A quick point on this, even during the shitstorm of '08 onwards, you'll notice that our borrowing costs didn't move up significantly at all.

Yes, in the past we needed the IMF - at the time we were not on a full fiat system, we were part of exchange rate mechanisms.

So you're saying we should suddenly rely on academy products and just hope they're like Kane, a once in a generation player? Instead of Adebayor who at his peak can be one of the best strikers in the league? 

Ok?

We literally would never considered doing that two seasons ago, and the suggestion itself would have been laughed at. You're placing too much pressure on the academy players and actively hurting the club.

&gt; Because they wanted to go to Liverpool. You do realise the players have a choice in where they go right?

I find it unlikely that both players would chose a weaker club in an inferior city unless Spurs never put a serious bid in for them in the first place.

Some quotes there, seems like he'll be on loan.
&gt;Barker admits he may need to gain experience out on loan at some point if City decides league football will develop his game, but his ultimate aim will always be to break into City’s first-team at some point.

&gt;“If I do spend time out on loan, I’ll do my best to help that club while bringing my own game on,” he said. “If that happens, I’ll grow as a player and then I can use that to benefit my future at City – the end goal will always be geared to progressing here.

&gt;“I’ve been here 10 years in October so all I’ve ever wanted is to do well for City and this contract gives me the time to realise all my hopes. I’m just taking things step by step and will do whatever Patrick Vieira thinks is best. If he thinks that’s with the EDS or whatever, I’ll be happy because I have a great relationship with him.

&gt;Falcao vs 37yo Drogba - only time will tell but I'm hoping he will be an improvement. If he finds some of his Atletico form it would end up being a massive signing.

we will have to wait and see if this works out but falcao offers something different than drogba, hes a crafty six yard box striker and his movement is very good. very different compared to the style of drogba.

However they get lazy, rather than do a proper assessment of what a property would be worth (accounting for inflation) in 1991 based on it's sale price, they do the valuation based on the market for a similar build in the area.

You can see how this is problematic. By giving valuations based on a quick internet search on Rightmove, they create a positive feedback loop of bandings that rise which are not in line with the true value of the property you just bought - especially in a downward market (councils won't adjust their bandings down automatically - it must always be challenged).

When I last did this exercise I checked a block of flats and noted that many of the same sized units had different bandings... in fact the one I had challenged got it's banding reduced, but do you think the ~~council~~ VOA did the same for the other units.....? Of course not.

You might be buying a house on the end of a street for 50k less than one on the other end - but unless the ~~council~~ government do a proper check (and what incentive do they have to do that?), you'll likely get the banding for the 50k more house - which could be the difference between a 'C' and a 'D'.

Surely not the same Westrop who recounts how he was ""told to go away"" by the Union of Jewish Students (UJS) - and this was presumably not for his Peace-Standing-for ways since he was ""especially critical of UJS' current policy of handing out Palestinian flags"", because it ""gives credence to groups like the Palestine Solidarity Campaign which claim that they have a real grievance"".

Interesting/boring digression:  There was a guy called Emile Durkheim back at the end of the 19th century who argued that there is a ""natural rate of crime"".  This arises not from the fact that humans are inherently criminal, so much as from the fact that people as a group need to see 'offenders' being punished, and this visible punishment serves to reaffirm everyone's commitment to the social group as a whole.  So if society managed to reduce the rate of violent behaviours, it would end up criminlaising more actions (which weren't criminal before) in order to keep the spectacle of sufficient people being visibly punished at the required level.  This is a process which has pretty obviously been going on for the last 5 or 6 decades, and probably explains much of the moral panic over things like paedophillia in the last few decades or the 'war on drugs'.",null,0,null,1438609812,null,null,false,0,ctpvgmn,null,t3_3flpvr,null,null,null,t1_ctprfdg,null,null,null,1440253203,null,9,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9,null

Our desperation to topple that government along with open support for terrorists by our local allies allowed ISIS to carve up a space in Syria for themselves. They used the weapons, equipment and experience to take Iraq.

When you send 3000 tonnes of Croatian weapons and they end up in the hands of Al-Qaeda, ISIS and a group that kidnaps UN peacekeepers - you know your fucking up. That was in 2013. This year the US is still sending more weapons that are being used to support Al-Qaeda offensives. We have done nothing to get Turkey to shut its borders down nor have we taken the Gulf countries to task.

Our policies are mutually contradictory. We want to fight against terrorists and topple the Syrian government. Yet the people who fight the most effectively against the Syrian Army are terrorists. This leads us into a situation where we turn a blind eye to terrorists when their actions suits our need.

Al-Qaeda right now governs a province in Syria right next to Turkey. If Al-Qaeda is fighting against the Syrian Army, the Americans allow rebels they supplied with weapons to fight with them. Thus the US is helping Al-Qaeda increase its territorial control.

A significant number of older people are 'unlocking' equity from their homes to fund their lifestyles. That in itself represents a tangible amount of consumer spending which is propping up the economy. Many saved too little for their retirement so their home is their nestegg. Politicians have learned that people feel wealthier if their house prices go up (given that it is by far the largest asset 99% of homeowners own), so there is a politicial incentive to inflate things year after year.

On the flip side high property prices have to be balanced with the loss of present and future economic growth. Not just in unaffordable housing but office space as well in prime locations. The cost of doing business will meet an inflection point where it is less economical to operate in or around the capital simply because wealthy oligarchs have inflated property prices.

Outside of the capital more housebuilding could be used as an incentive to get younger workers to move to other towns and cities for work. If the cost of living can be significantly lowered while retaining relatively good salaries then that is good for the economy in the long term. In the Netherlands the government retains the land but leases good quality housing meaning they can gradually increase density without selling the family silver.

The difference, hypothetically, assuming policy was changed to do away with gilts, would be that they would indeed hold cash instead of bonds, to meet existing capital requirements, assuming that part of things went unchanged. A consequence for the banks/funds would be to lose yield. They'd still be subject to the same capital requirements, but the assets would be different, cash rather than bonds. This would result in less or no interest payments for the government to pay out, another bonus with regards to the governments fiscal programme, and probably a net gain for the economy as a whole, as the money that would be spent on interest payments, can be spent doing whatever the government sees fit. It would have a stronger multiplier effect than padding already enormous balance sheets and would probably spend more time in the ""real"" economy.

I also speculate that they would be more risk averse having to use a non yielding asset as the safe side of their risk profiles, as it's just a £5 note, not a £5 note with 0.5-1.5% annuity tacked on to it. In actuality, government bonds from countries like ours, are better than cash yet just as safe, so you could argue that they have even less risk than cash.

it works the other way too, unfortunately - I had 4 years NCD on my car when I got my first bike. ):

Anyway.  

&gt; Is it easier than riding a bike? 

You need more hours, on average, to learn how to ride a car. It's not that it's harder, it's just different. Possibly, less incentive to get good quickly?  
Target fixation still exists, it's just not as pronounced.  
And on a bike, you don't have any real hand-holding. A learner car driver, with a proper instructor, has dual controls where the instructor can take control of the brake and clutch.

&gt; when i sit in peoples car and observe the mirrors i'm amazing they can see whats coming up behind them.

Rear view mirror. If they even use it.  
It's angled so that it's useless to anyone else in the car.  
When you're on your bike behind a car, and you can't see their eyes in that mirror, then they have it set wrong, and you need to pay attention around them, because they ain't using it.  
If you can see a woman driver's cleavage in it, she's got it angled to see her own face to do her make up. I wish I was joking.

You feel a lot safer in a car, due to being enclosed.

&gt; for terrible weather days i.e snow/ice.

Cars are terrible for those too. You just won't fall over if you lose traction.

&gt; Driving them seems simple enough, its just maneuvering them in spots like parking lots and stuff.

Practice, and ""knowing"" where your wheels are.",null,0,null,1438610816,null,null,false,0,ctpvy7c,null,t3_3fmb73,null,null,null,t3_3fmb73,null,null,null,1440253433,null,3,null,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,3,null
