 * Breakfast has a clear ""wake people the fuck up and try not to mention the fact they've got the whole of the rest of the day ahead"". Grimshaw does a good job at that, he's interesting (even if people find him grating)

 * Mills &amp; his mate know how to do the post-lunch show. Give people decent content to listen to if they're on their lunch time, give them something entertaining to look forward to at the end of their show. Make sure people realise that it's nearly over.

 * Gregg James - instantly remind people that they're only 1-2 hours from leaving work, get through the last couple of hours, and then bring in the night time show. 

 * Newsbeat - really decent news for the target audience. Doesn't dumb it down too much, covers interesting stories relevant to their partnership, probably the most impartial part of the BBC news team.

i live in turkey, whole family is beşiktaş fans. so, i watched almost all the games for all my life.

bilic is not a good coach. not even close. for 2 years, he fucks all the chances he had. this year, bjk could be the champions, but he lost 7 points in 3 games -very easy games- cos lack of tactical knowlegde. and now they're gonna 3rd. think about all the money lost for not joining cl. and now think about that the money goes to your rivals.

team doesn't even play good. you probably saw only the european games -much probably only arsenal, tottenham and liverpool games. arsenal and tottenham games were good, liverpool is just an extra. you saw the goal. without it, there're no beşiktaş. at brugge games, proudhomme make some awesome changes and won 2 games. now, he is a good coach. bilic just watched.

if there's no pressure, he can manage to do something. but if there's a little pressure, he losts it.

he sticks with the 4th ref, always complains about something, never watches games, does stupid player choices etc. etc. he probably doesn't know how to train them -there're romours that he stills does condition overrides, which causes the team fall apart at 50th minute mark.

his team can't hold the score. idk how much points lost with that way -his team always concedes after 70-75. he plays down after 1-0 and loses with that way too.

he is not a winner, he is much like an amigo at the bench. he also is very obsessive with some players -whether if they play good or bad. they always start, they never comes to the bench. it drives you crazy.

beşiktaş fans -some of them- loves him but admits that he has to change, progress. let me tell you, since he joined beşiktaş, he didn't make any progress. not even 1 drop of it. they think he should be more open minded about his players. more fair with giving the shirts. but i don't think he'll change.

long story short, he (maybe) can do something with mid table teams if there's no pressure on him. but i don't think he'll be successfull with a big team. he can't handle that pressure.

ps: he didn't even won a derby game. this year, his team couldn't even scored against galatasaray or fenerbahçe. you think about it.

It's market failure at the moment because none of them could step forward and increase wages unless there was an increase in productivity.

The reason for it is the subsidies - if it was not for them then there wouldn't be any labour for them to use. 

Removing the subsidies is one way to fix it, but it would be very painful and cause all sorts of trouble.

The other is to force them all to increase wages simultaneously with an increase to the minimum wage.

Other ways are to remove the massive effective rate of tax the working poor pay - way higher effectively than a middle earner.

I'm not sure how up to date it is in terms of the Government's thinking, and you have to be careful with it because it gets some of the legal basics horribly wrong and blatantly lies (as many people seem to do), but I think the key things they want to change are these parts:

&gt; Clarify the Convention rights, to reflect a proper balance between rights and responsibilities

As it is, the Convention (or the HRA) does not put any responsibilities on individuals; the Conservatives seem to want to add in responsibilities (or, perhaps, make the rights conditional on them). They want to restrict the rights in immigration cases, deny some rights to foreign nationals in some cases (because they're foreign, I guess, so don't deserve human rights?) and narrow the scope of what isn't allowed by Article 3, the prohibition on torture.

&gt; Limit the use of human rights laws to the most serious cases.

It seems that the Government will get to decide what counts as a ""serious"" case; if a violation of a person's human rights is deemed not to be serious by that definition, they can't do anything about it.

&gt; Limit the reach of human rights cases to the UK

So that the Government can do what it likes provided it is acting outside the UK (Guantanamo Bay springs to mind for some reason, or the US's ""constitution-free zones"").

Other than that most of what they're proposing is merely changing the words, without changing the underlying law. It will sound good in speeches and make it seem that they're ""saving British sovereignty"" or whatever, but won't have much effect, if any.

Personally, while I understand their arguments (after all, human rights necessarily limit what a government can do), the biggest problem for me - other than the dishonesty - is that they seem to be falling into the trap of being reactionary. It's as if they've taken 3 or 4 unpopular cases (Abu Qatada, Abu Hamza, whole-life tariffs, the Land Rover case(?), Afghan (or Iraqi?) torture case), as (mis)understood by the media, and proposed adjusting the HRA so as to ""fix"" these specific cases, but without trying to identify or fix the underlying problem - that the Governments actions in these cases was contrary to basic human rights.

I know plenty of young professionals in London.  Unless they have parents living locally (some do) they all just *have* to live in central parts of Zone 2 - Clapham, Brixton, Finsbury Park, the edge of Tower Hamlets.  Nowhere else will do and these people couldn't point out Mottingham or Boston Manor on a map.

They all moan about the cost yet have no drive or motivation to sort themselves out.  One girl says ""... I wish I could live in X instead of Clapham, Clapham's so expensive"" without a hint of irony or sarcasm (her parents lived in St. Albans ffs, she could have commuted and needless to say she's got 79 housemates in Clapham).

You don't mention what your job is, is it something you will be able to do part time/over the holidays if you do go to uni? You also don't mention what you plan on studying, but you could try and reach out to the university/existing students to find out how many timetabled hours you have a week, this will affect how easily you can work alongside your study. 

I had some savings and have worked part-time throughout and I lived with my parents for the first year. For next year I have put down a deposit on a house with 3 other students on my course, which works well for me but I can understand it might not work for you. You are likely to end up leaning on your partner somewhat if you end up doing this without any savings, but do check what financial support is available to you. 

On a positive note, many universities relax their entry requirements for mature students for many courses, so you'd probably get in comfortably as long as your course/university isn't too competitive. 

I would recommend it! It definitely involved downgrading my lifestyle when compared with working, and I'm lucky that I was able to lean on my parents for my first year, but it's been a great experience and I feel as though I'm learning valuable skills.

A Jet ski is actually a personal water craft (generic name for well, personal water craft) Also made by other companies like Sea Doo who make the Spark. So a Sea doo spark and a Kawasaki Jet ski are similar products but we're used to the term Jet ski being used as the generic term rather than Personal water craft.

For what its worth there is only so much you can do to get off the bike looking normal and maintain good protection. A leather jacket (or textile) and some kevlar jeans go a long way. I use regular bike boots (alpinestars) and put them under the jeans (they don't really notice) then change into trainers or whatever when I get where I'm going if there is somewhere discrete to change them.

Hi fellow Liverpool fans! I'm an entrepreneur and I'm continuously thinking of cool things we can do to make our world better. The tribute Steven Gerrard received at Anfield was incredible and it just shows how much he is respected. I think we can carry this tribute on and help raise money for the Steven Gerrard Foundation at the same time.

Rather like the ALS ice bucket challenge, lets create a short selfie video thanking Steven for his incredible contribution to our club, nominate other Liverpool fans to do the same, and donate to the SGF. I think this is an incredible way to not only thank him but also help out his wonderful charity.

Players like Cristiano Ronaldo have made a video thanking him, now its the turn of the fans: US!

This is what bugs me most about this: words can have multiple meanings, and most people use the word ""racism"" in a way such that anyone can be racist, whereas some people use a meaning in which only members of a powerful majority can be racist.  Fine; whatever: semantics are boring. Use words however you like - who cares?

But when someone called this woman ""racist"" she knew *perfectly well* what they were saying, what she was actually being accused of: the first meaning; people were saying she was unpleasantly pre-judging an entire race of people. Her response was basically to pretend she thought people were accusing her of the second meaning, and arguing back against that.  It's as if someone accused me smashing a window, and I responded that windows are little boxes that appear on computer screens, and cannot be smashed.

I think we can carry this tribute on and help raise money for the Steven Gerrard Foundation at the same time.

Rather like the ALS ice bucket challenge, lets create a short selfie video thanking Steven for his incredible contribution to our club, nominate other Liverpool fans to do the same, and donate to the SGF. I think this is an incredible way to not only thank him but also help out his wonderful charity.

Yeah, I made a joke and followed it up with an argument. You just insulted me.

&gt;I would much much rather have a police officer on hand in an emergency than a ticket inspector, especially since police officers familiar with the railway exists and in fact there's a whole police force dedicated to policing the railway. Perhaps you've heard of them? They're called the British Transport Police.

Well, you're not getting either. Like I said, I really don't think the police can afford (nor do they plan) to staff every train. Wouldn't you rather have a guard, even though they're obviously pathetic plebs who are beneath you? We managed just fine with train guards up until now, and they have the training to deal with such an emergency - so what exactly is the reason to get rid of them?

&gt;Also you're only argument against automated trains is that they're decades into the future? I'm afraid I have some bad news for you. It's a matter of years, not decades before this technology can be applied to other railways.

How does that make any difference? You're advocating firing people *before* their job has been made obsolete. You're just wrong, stop trying to move the goalposts to make it seem like I am anti-automation and instead actually argue against me. Oh wait, you can't because you don't have a leg to stand on.

&gt;I personally know many cancer specialists, I share a lab with a research group dedicated to prostate cancer research and I know a lot of oncologists (thats what clinical cancer specialists are called). NONE of them would ever dream of standing in the way of advances in technology because it may put them out of a job (in fact they'd be ecstatic) so don't be so fucking stupid.

How about you read what I said, and come back to me. I don't think your cancer specialists mates would be too keen if you told them you plan on firing them before cancer has been cured. But then again, I keep saying the same thing and you keep arguing against something I haven't said so why should I bother? You obviously don't know how to read (or spell) and you can't debate without insulting me.

&gt;Finally you suggest that train drivers should have jobs found for them before we automate things? Surely it's their own responsibility to find a job for themselves? Thats the way the rest of the country works (along with not getting pay rises for nothing) so I will ask once again. What makes train drivers so special? So much better than everyone else in the country? Why are they deserving of handouts? Because that's exactly what pay rises above inflation without increased performance or responsability are, handouts.

&gt; After an extraordinary 300-year run, Britain has essentially resigned as a global power.

&gt; The same is true of other elements of Britain&amp;#039;s global influence.

But we already do this with progressive taxation (as small as the difference is with corporation tax), rules on shop opening hours etc. We don't have a completely free market and with good reason, this is no different. That any financial burden should be minimised is only fair but if you think one existing at all is reason enough not to do it then you're ignoring precedent.

&gt;Why create complex laws that apply to an arbitrary subset of food retailers when there is minimal benefit to be gained?

The British Retailers Consortium claims the big supermarkets threw away 200,000 tonnes of food waste last year and in 2012 the figure Channel 4 claimed was 300,000 tonnes. Even if only a quarter of this was usable it would not be of 'minimal' benefit.

null,false,RangerUK,null,null,null,"Law grad here, I disagree with some of the advice you've been given here. 

A contract **can be set aside for mistake** if there was an error on the part of either side, in certain circumstances. 

However, it looks like you went into a store, there was an ""*invitation to treat*(like a displayed sale offer), to which you made an *offer to purchase* which was then *accepted by the store* so the contract is complete. Given that you had the *intention to enter legal relations* the **contract is valid.**

At the moment, I would say there are 2 options. Either the store arrange to cancel the order and give you a refund, due to their mistake (a legal course of action they would be likely be successful with at court), OR they accept that the contract was formed and they are in breach of contract for *non-performance*

Nonperformance is where a party fails to do what they agreed to do in the contract. For instance, you and I make a deal for you to buy 10 oranges for £50. Expensive oranges you might say. If you give me £50, you have *performed*. If I give you 10 apples, I have *not performed* and so I am in breach of contract. The remedy in breach if contract is for the misfeasor (the person breaching the contract) to make good on the promises made and ensure the contract is performed successfully. I would have to give you 10 oranges and take back the apples I'd given you. Which is fair enough.

&gt;Cheeky is a word used by english people like myself. 1. it is a word used to describe someone who does something or says something sort of disrespectful and sometimes rude, but says it in a cunning way. 2. can also be used in a more serious way i.e if you found out that one of your friends has been talking behind your back, you might say that she is a ""cheeky bitch""

We sold Oxford, Cambridge and Sandhurst to the children of dictators and international students when we ceased properly funding higher education. Every university is entirely reliant on private funding and income obtained outside government to stay alive.

We are almost exclusively reliant on private finance, charity, visitor centre income or EU funding to preserve our world heritage and nationally important sites.

* We have no ability to negotiate our own free trade deals with other nations independently.
* Freedom of movement agreements with countries where GDP per capita and the minimum wage is 10x lower than ours means there is always the possibility of millions of people upping and leaving their homes to come and live here where they're almost guaranteed a better living standard.

Mind providing a page, or even document, reference for that claim? It's almost an 8000 page long specification - and the only mention of *proprietary* in a text search is in reference to T-SQL &amp; ODBC when explaining the use of examples for those technologies in two paragraphs.

So far as I know the original .doc format is never mentioned in the specification, I've never come across it, and certainly don't remember a large block of blank pages referencing backwards compatibility, admittedly it's a reference guide at work, and not exactly bed time reading, but 20 pages seems like it would stand out even in a document set as large as this (especially if as you say it's in the .docx spec, which is only 100 pages - surely I'd have noticed near 20% of the thing was just whitespace). Compatibility with other document formats (OpenOffice Formats as example) aren't discussed, and other contained file formats - such as jpeg/png/gif are mentioned in passing as examples of supported other technologies, but their existence in a docx is not encoded into the docx file - just referenced and packaged in the parent XML file. Your document viewer needs to already support opening those documents to be able to render them in a docx (the same as the Open Office and Libre Specifications).

null,false,rappersdo,,Labour Member,null,"I'm sorry but this is absolute tosh. He uses a quote of Diane Abbott's where she was clearly exaggerating to make a point, to tar all those who are against Blairism with the same brush. 

There's more than the Iraq war to hate about Blair. Mandelson and Campbell admit in their first term they were more interested in headlines than reform and this carried on for all 3 terms. 

I'm not sure any critic of Blairism actually thinks a return to it would mean war crimes. But the eroison of civil liberties, privatisation and Blair's attitude towards business was all wrong. I'm not saying you shouldn't be pro-business, but there's a fine line between being pro-business and anti-worker and for me Blair crossed it. 

What is a myth though is Labour losing the election because they were too left wing and that modern day Blairism would be remotely centrist. 

Labour didn't defend their record on the economy and people didn't trust them not to go into coalition with the SNP. Labour were still backing right-wing policies like workfare and Ed Miliband had went from saying he was a socialist at the start of his leadership to telling one-nation Tories ""I'll be your champion."" 

Labour's campaign strategy was all wrong, they tried to rise above the Tories spin, and it worked for a time, when they were attacking Ed personally. But when they moved onto the SNP people listened and Labour gave nothing in return. People will talk about the clever tories but it was them bricking it going into election night. 

One of Blair's main promises was that he would get rid of the sleaze from politics after Major's embarrasment of a government and he failed to do that, instead we got as much sleaze with added war crimes. 

To return to Blairism would show no lessons have been learned from Scotland, you can't take advantage of Labour strongholds, they will leave Labour eventually. 

For me even if Blairism was proven to win the next election for Labour, what's more important, winning an election or actually standing for an alternative to the tories?",null,0,null,1432347519,null,0,false,0,cri2yml,null,t3_36xuz0,null,t1_cri2yml,null,t3_36xuz0,null,null,null,1433218151,null,5,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,5,null

Britishness is a really vauge term that only gets more vauge the more you look into it. This idea that Britishness is some long lasting identity is total hokum. Its pretty much a Victorian idea, same with empire, little England and the notion that heavily farmed fields and hedges are ""natural"".

London has its own identity and its own culture, same way places like Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool have theirs.

Throw out the two most profitable years for each side and the United goes from net outspending Liverpool by £100m to outspending by £170m. Net spend is what matters for transfers. Period.

In any case, I was drawing the line from billionaire owners to the stadium investments and raising revenues. Boiling this down to transfers is simplistic and not very valuable. Even still, that data doesn't support what you're trying to argue at all.

First off, an important distinction. There's literary/court Urdu, which I'll call 'High Urdu'. It's pretty different from spoken Urdu and can be extremely Persianized with esafe (think Osmanli's 'lisân-ı Osmânî' and stuff), *but* - both still exist. High Urdu in culture and literature but colloquial Urdu too, which is almost identical to colloquial Hindi. (Or could even be the same thing, depending on how you define it). This spoken or colloquial form, and specifically the northern version is called (by some) Hindustani. Indian languages tend to have high diglossia so this isn't too out of the ordinary. I'll expand on this a bit later.

Urdu is based on/formed from *khadi boli*, an Indo Aryan dialect spoken around Delhi. As you say, there was heavy Persianization and Persian literary culture. Hindi is Hindustani/khadi boli that has been Sanskritized and looks to native Indic culture/history. You can think of it as a spectrum - Urdu - Hindustani - Hindi. 

You might be interested to know that despite the very small influence of Turkish (just around 40 words), the '-ci/ca' suffix of Turkish is present in some Hindi/Urdu words. (And it's still a productive suffix in Syrian Arabic, apparently). I'm currently dabbling in Turkish and I find lots of common Persian loan words, helps a lot, lol.

Hindustani/Hindi-Urdu is a local language in what was in the past called Hindustan - The Gangetic plains, the UP/Bihar/Haryana/Delhi region. Some of these areas had/have lots of Muslims, and the ones that migrated to the newly formed country of Pakistan spoke Hindustani/Urdu natively. However as the years have gone by, and given Urdu's status there (media is pretty much ONLY Urdu or English from what I've heard, a far cry from India's *very* flourishing regional media culture where many languages have their own prolific movie industries), many urban non Muhajir Pakistanis have come to speak it as a native language or first language.

Well as for the decline of Persian, from what I've read, that was mostly the British's doing. Urdu was not official in even the Muslim ruled realms until the 19th century. It was just Persian. But then the culture shifted towards a Persianized Hindustani or Urdu. Not too sure on this.

&gt; Also I imagine that many South Asian languages are similar to Turkish in the way that you can make yourself sound more eloquent by using more Persian/Arabic vocabulary?

Well, yes and no. When it comes to Hindi pop culture, Persian loans (essentially pushing towards the Urdu end of the spectrum) are seen as cultured, poetic and stuff. Poetry, Bollywood and stuff will be heavy in Persian to give that feel. HOWEVER. In some circumstances, Sanskrit vocab is used to give a different flavor, like in religion, historical stories and stuff. And importantly, that's just for Hindi though. Most other languages are not as Persianized, sometimes even minimally, and tend towards *only* Sanskrit for their prestige forms - Kannada, Marathi, Bengali, Malayalam, Oriya, etc.

In the south, Tamil tends towards Dravidian roots or Sanskritic roots depending on the context and connotations. (The other Dravidian languages just focus on Sanskritic roots). This split is the closest to the Turkish Islamist Perso Arabic vs Ataturkist native Turkic split. Why I say this is because a) In Indian political rhetoric, Persian loans are associated with Muslim culture and therefore (mainstream) Hindi speaking politicians tend to use heavier Sanskrit vocab in their speeches and not Persian. Muslim politicians mostly use all flowery Persianate Urdu. b) Tamil had a nationalist movement where Tamil's antiquity and Dravidian roots, like 'nativity', pre dating Indo Aryan, etc was emphasized. Also Sanskrit was seen as a Hindu, 'Northern' influence which they wanted to purge from the language. (LOTS of pseudohistory there!). Dravidian politics is big here and Dravidian political rhetoric and general Tamil cultural rhetoric has more Dravidian vocab as a result of this history. OTOH Tamil Brahmins and more 'politically/culturally Hindu' Tamil is pretty accommodating of Sanskrit. This to me seems a stronger parallel to Turkey's political language case.

That wasn't the point, but I can see how that might not have been clear (and Becks did wear the band for a few years and many individual games).  The Galaxy have a very high standard for DPs, and there's no automatic acceptance based on pedigree, especially with captaincy.

&gt; But Keane is miles ahead of Beckham in terms of passion and energy for the MLS game

I'd say that's arguable, both on the field and off.  You could question neither's commitment to the sport or the team, and Becks has been huge for league advocacy and expansion.  He met *today* with the league president about establishing the stadium for a Miami expansion.  *Stevie credited Beckham* with helping him make the decision to go to LA.  Tell me that doesn't represent some sort of passion for the MLS game.

This also misses the point, as well, and quite ironically, the majority of the question about Stevie in LA is about how much he'll actually be committed to playing (which *I* think he'll quell, but you can understand the concern).  Again, there's a high standard for DPs from those that came before, high expectations, and a well-established team dynamic and captaincy.

Things to check out - The barbican, the how (really nice when its warm), you can go up to the moors and walk around or camp and call into a small quaint country pub, travel into Cornwall and go to one of the many beaches, the Eden project, zoos, aquariums, travel up to Exeter or bristol, go see where the Mayflower departed from. Join clubs at the SU! Surfing, skiing, snowboarding often go on group trips abroad to do their sport, there is also a back packing club where they plan and raise money and travel for a few weeks around Europe or other places together. There are more things to do just get involved or check out trip advisor and see best rated activities around Plymouth. Go out with your course mates, room mates and drink and have a laugh! Its how you make close friends in the first few weeks. And student nights are cheap. 

Tipping culture-dont tip bartenders, there is no point, they get paid plenty unless you're a regular and know them well then you can say and one for yourself. If your in a nightclub they don't want the hassle just order your drink, pay, get out the way so they can see who is next in line.

Of course not. Many Americans feel strongly about their roots. It is nice that you wave our flag so proudly to them. But it is a bit triumphant by default. If someone tells you they're Italian-American or French-American, you've won by default. That's why most Americans hide their British ancestry you see for not wanting to appear smug. It's the true true.

&gt;Is it laughable that I label myself ""British American?"" 

Most Europeans find the prefix laughable. But the fact you guys don't, is what really matters. However you ever visit here, it might be easier to say American with recent British ancestry.

Also, the fact is Scotland isn't a country - it's a regional constituent of the United Kingdom. Just like many former kingdoms in Europe that cease to exist and have merged into a single kingdom, such as the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which is made up of former kingdoms. 

Germany and Spain are too made up of former Kingdoms, the main difference is the UK has allowed the former kingdoms to keep their single nationalist English, Welsh and so on identities; while Spain crushed off most of their former kingdoms to fully merge, as did most of Europe. The UK should have crushed pathetic nationalism long ago.

Support for separation hasn't gone over 50%, and the fact that the SNP can only get 50% of the vote in a 75% turnout in this election speaks volumes; no mandate for separation.  Even those who voted 'No' many voted SNP, due to labour being an awful party with no charisma. The turnout for referendum was over 80% of total electorate, decision was clear.

Anyhow, the UK is a democracy and if the majority of that country (which Scotland reaffirmed its place in) wishes to leave the EU, then the democratic will of the people will be listened to.

I find it ironic that one part of the UK can leave the UK, thus having massive ramifications on the entire country but somehow EU membership is a collective decision. 

Scotland is a region of the UK, with devolved powers from central government. I've lived in Scotland all my life, never would consider it my country, the UK is.

The EU is a union, for many illogical reasons people somehow compare a botched up European Union and compare it to the acts of Union that formed the UK as a country. There are many differences between the UK and EU, the main one being that the UK is a single country, the EU isn't a country.  The  'Union' has become a synonym for 'country' in the UK.

There are of course many companies in the UK that declare all of their sales to the UK taxman but still pay little/no tax because they pay their foreign subsidiary companies billions per year for ""licencing rights"" or some other fictional object of unknown worth.

We can't say definitively whether this new tax will work or not until we actually see the money come into the coffers and the first court cases are won. 

Maybe Amazon thinks that the diverted-profit tax primarily applies to diverted revenue, they might think they have a better chance of avoiding the tax by just diverting the expenditure abroad instead. They pay their lawyers and accountants a lot of money to figure out how to con the state so don't celebrate yet. If Amazon post 0 profit next year the government will be stuck in a position where it has to hit them with a diverted profit tax but Amazon can stand up in court and say ""but we're declaring all of our income now, it's just much lower than our expenses"".

It'd be important to know whether or not you did pay tax on what proportion of it as it's something that could be reclaimed if you start a business in the future (for example).

----

Option one: They're just offering a discount for paying in cash and saying it's ""paying less VAT"". You're paying 20% VAT on a lower actual charge. Nothing dodgy or complicated, just an awkward way of saying/explaining it.

----

Option two:

So first off, you'll pay 20% VAT on anything that requires VAT added (ignoring some of the complexities around different rates, this is mostly true).

However, someone can only charge you VAT if they're VAT registered, and *you don't have to get VAT registered*, not if your income is under about 85k/year.

So let's say your building team are charging £10000 for this and are *not* VAT registered, and the company managing it all *is* VAT registered and will charge you £10000 for their work on this (these numbers are only for simplicity).

If the building team charge their work to the company and then the company charges you, the company must charge you £20000 + VAT, then pay £10000 to the building team. Building team gets £10k, company gets £10k, taxman gets £4k.

Now, if you pay the building team directly, the building team charge £10000 + no VAT and the company charges £10000 + VAT. Building team gets £10k, company gets £10k, taxman gets £2k.

Half the tax and *I think* a legal alternative. However, there are likely to be differences in who is responsible for sorting things out if there are problems (since if the builders mess something up your contract is with them not the company).

Certainly I think supermarkets should be encouraged to be generous with their property, especially where they have little to lose. It could even be incentivised through some kind of tax break, though the government is currently trying to close loopholes, not open them.

&gt;Germany and Spain are too made up of former Kingdoms, the main difference is the UK has allowed the former kingdoms to keep their single nationalist English, Welsh and so on identities; while Spain crushed off most of their former kingdoms to fully merge, as did most of Europe. The UK should have crushed pathetic nationalism long ago.

What's the difference between the ""pathetic nationalism"" in Scotland and Wales and the nationalism people have for the UK as a whole? And I'd say that the 2 main parties, especially the Conservatives, are just as nationalistic as the SNP.

Also, crushing people's identities isn't a very democratic thing you know. Especially when much of the UK identity is an English identity - seeing as England makes up 85% of it. I hate to ask what you think of the Welsh language, or Scottish Gaelic.

The UK has no god-given right to exist, it's a union of countries - which were brought together and could separate just as easily.

Take the rate, less default rate, less fess and you have an expected return before tax.

When funds are available, ill go onto the secondary market and buy loans that meet or exceed my target return. 

Sometimes ill bid on new loans, prefereably the large ones as they tend to give better rates, so i can bid as high as possible and re-bid if i get out-bid. This has allowed excellend rates on some new loans.

The key is diversification, i dont hold more than 1% of my funds in any one company. By holding ~200 loan parts across nearly as many companies, the numbers should average out and it just becomes a numbers game with little time needed in actually checking the companies.

I prefer to go for A+/A as at the moment they are giving better rates, and it has tax advantages against poorer credit ratings, i.e bad debt cant be used to offset interest for tax purposes, so a lower rate with a lower bad debt rate reduces the tax burden increasing the overall return. However i do hold loans at poorer ratings where rates are good.

Two other common strategies exist as far as i can tell. First would be to read an research companies carefully, making more informed investments in fewer companies to try and reduce bad debt rates. Second, flipping loans. I.e bidding on new loans in a similar method as i described above, to get a rate above market/average, then selling them immediately on the secondary market at a markup. This is a bit trickier and riskier but reduces tax as the markup isnt taxed like interest would be.

Indeed. Administering it would be extremely expensive.

In any case, it's foolish to imagine that stripping benefits from people automatically results in a net saving. If you push those already with problems, such as addictions, into poverty and homelessness, you create new costs, anything from increased healthcare needs through to petty crime for subsistence reasons.

You're quite right to point out that those who have never had a job, such as recent graduates, don't fit the stereotype. Young adults leaving care, and those who have had to deal with long-term illness, are other groups desperately in need of support rather than punishment. Those leaving prison or young offenders' institutions, while not likely to attract as much sympathy, are another group where preventing access to support would be catastrophic both for the individuals and for its potential impact on society.

You really need to do a urine test at least once every 3 months or hair test every 6 months to stop people detoxing before their test or going on binges straight afterwards. Either way, the only way it works for companies is that the cost is offset by cheaper insurance. Doesn't work like that with welfare. 

And I agree with the graduate situation, since I'm in it. Had to move back in with my parents since I work in a small industry where there aren't that many jobs around. I'm incredibly thankful I have that option, since if I could qualify for benefits there's no way I'd be able to keep them: once I caught up with vacancies, I could only find at most three more a day after that, often none. Having to prove you're spending 8 hours a day job hunting and sending off X amount of applications a week seriously doesn't work for every sector.

The Guardian predicts that 3000 workers will die before 2022. However the statistics are based on extrapolating the death rates of all migrant workers across the country, including deaths from natural causes, and including people who have no connection to the world cup. From The Guardian, regarding the data for Indian workers:

&gt; [Since the World Cup was awarded to Qatar in December 2010, there have been 717 recorded Indian deaths. However, the Indian embassy did not provide further details on who those individuals were, their cause of death or where they worked.](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/18/qatar-world-cup-india-migrant-worker-deaths)

Out of 1.2 million workers, statistically you would expect there to be several hundred deaths a year simply from natural causes. Despite the sensationalist headlines, there is actually nothing to suggest that the work-related death rate is higher than the global average.

There are of course plenty of other problems with Qatar as hosts and working and living conditions need to improve.",null,0,null,1432377412,null,0,1432379480,0,cribxuy,null,t3_36gylp,null,t1_cribxuy,null,t1_crdwz6n,null,null,null,1433222486,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

The reality is that there are so many existing facilities, and people and businesses, packed in along that route that there simply is no continuous path of virgin territory to place the tracks. So literally ALL of it needs to be rearranged to make room.

There are plenty of good [bars](http://visit-belfast.com/things-to-do/category/pubs-and-clubs) and excellent [restaurants](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurants-g186470-Belfast_Northern_Ireland.html), enough that you shouldn't end up eating and drinking off the same menu.  

Belfast is a small city and most things are easily accessible on foot from the city centre where I'm sure you'll be based.  You can use the public hire bikes to get around too, register [here](http://www.belfastbikes.co.uk/en/belfast/).
In terms of site seeing and local history, most visitors really rate the [black taxi tours](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attraction_Review-g186470-d1463489-Reviews-Paddy_Campbell_s_Belfast_Famous_Black_Cab_Tours-Belfast_Northern_Ireland.html).  You might also like to check out some of the great scenery that you may recognise from TV on a [Game of Thrones Tour](http://www.gameofthronestours.com/).
You can get lots of more information on similar things at the [Discover Northern Ireland](http://www.discovernorthernireland.com/) site.  It's worth checking on there before booking anything as they often have special offers.  You can also pick up lots of visitor information, maps etc., at the [Belfast Welcome Centre](http://visit-belfast.com/things-to-do/member/visit-belfast-welcome-centre).  

In terms of entertainment, there'll be [plenty going on](http://visit-belfast.com/whats-on/search/) while you're here.   Given your stated interests, you might like the [Q-Con](http://www.q-con.org.uk/) conference, or ~~[Nerdtopia Coffee Shop]~~.  I'm sure some local redditors with better knowledge of that scene could advise.  There are a couple of comic book shops in the city centre, [Forbidden Planet](http://www.store-opening-times.co.uk/forbidden-planet-belfast) and [Comic Book Guys](http://comicbookguys.co.uk/).

Belfast has a number of good [urban parks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_parks_and_gardens_in_Belfast), some of the best are linked by the [Lagan Towpath](http://www.walkni.com/walks/40/lagan-towpath/), all of which is accessible from the city centre.  There are lots of National Trust walking trails off in the parks and gardens along the way if you want some exercise, fresh air and scenery.

In terms of dating/meeting people, you could use Plenty of Fish and OKCupid.  I don't know what that scene is like locally though.  Northern Irish people like to think of themselves as warm and welcoming but striking up conversations with strangers can be difficult, I think we are guarded and initially suspicious of anyone who might  try to be friendly.  The fact that you're from overseas may help break down those barriers though.  

If you have any specific questions, PM me and I'll try to answer as best I can and I'd be happy to show you about and buy you a pint at some point.

Sterling leaving will probably always leave a sour taste in our mouths because he's the golden boy. We can say that he might hit the heights of Pogba or Gotze in a few years because he so could. But his wanton abandonment of respect for the club who invested so much time and faith in him is outrageous. 

If he signed a contract for half of what he was offered (not what he requested) while stabbing his agent in the eye with a tea spoon and went on to score and assist like a lunatic next season i'd still be hesitant to show the same love for him as I do say, Coutinho. 

Many things need to happen not just this summer but beyond for us to challenge for glory and until then we are just, and this hurts, a bit of a stepping stone, but there's no fucking need to kick us when we're down, especially by a 20 year old, who fucking plays for us.

Simply set public cameras to encrypt footage in one minute segments a few minutes after capture using a double public/private encryption key setup.

For example, fifteen minutes after capture each one-minute segment is encrypted using a combination of three public keys; one from the courts, one from the police and one from the ICO. To decrypt any specific segment would require a private key from two of the three aformentioned authorities. The fifteen minute buffer would provide a reasonable ability for CCTV operators to scrub through footage as-its-happening to assit real-time police activities.

The Conservative party do not broadly support separatism' instead they're a ""Unionist"" party that work in the interests of the entire United Kingdom, unlike the narrow-mindedness of a separatist party, such as the SNP.

I didn't say the UK should crush those identities now, that would not be very popular, though it should have done it long ago by integrating the British identity into society, thus wiping out separatism and petty Nationalism that we see today.

Scottish Gaelic is a wonderful waste of money and should be abolished, it is a hideous language with less than 1% of Scotland speaking it (more people speak Polish here). 

Nowhere has a ""God-given right"" - correct.  The UK is not merely a ""Union of countries"", it is a single country/sovereign state.  Scotland and England ceased to be a country when their Parliaments were abolished and a new single authority was created, in the name of the British Parliament and sovereign single British Monarchy.  The UK is a country, it devolves power to its regions; obviously nationalism makes the illusion of ""countries within a country"" - that it is not technically accurate, what-so-over. 

It is up to the British Parliament to offer a referendum, you obviously have no clue about the section-30 order passed by the British Parliament to allow a referendum on separation - why? - It's obvious, constitutional matters is a reserved matter for the United Kingdom.

Eh, change is happening in the party landscape, it just happens at a snail's pace.

&gt; Looking to America is a part of what lost Labour the election, Axelrod &amp; co. clearly had no clue what they were doing so I'm not sure the comparison actually has any answers.

The Conservatives also hired an Obama campaigner - Jim Messina. Who also happened to be the *data* guy for Obama's campaign, as opposed to the ""messaging"" job Axelrod was employed for. Plus, Messina was deeply embedded in the campaign while Axelrod's involvement basically amounted to a bunch of conversations. If anything, it wasn't the presence of American expertise that cost Labour the election, it was the dearth and wrong sort of it.

&gt; I can see the comparison but I think the last election proved people don't care half as much.

This is exactly the point - Labour historically has problems with turning out the vote and ""shy Tories"". It doesn't help that the demographic most likely to vote - old people - also strongly leans Tory. In several constituencies, non-voters outnumbered the votes for the largest party, and that massive disillusionment with Labour cost it all of Scotland. The main challenge for Labour is to mobilise people. And this is precisely the problem the digital side of Obama's campaign tackled so well - by mobilising people with customised, individualised campaigning and a strong ground effort feeding data into a centralised database to provide evidence. Obama managed to turn out young voters and black voters in high numbers, which is crucial if he wanted to beat the votes of the similarly right-leaning old white voters. In short, people not caring is exactly the problem the Democrats managed to tackle that Labour failed.",null,0,null,1432381331,null,0,1432388624,0,cricsn9,null,t3_36ximx,null,t1_cricsn9,null,t1_cri6bw7,null,null,null,1433222888,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

He can take on his man, can finish alright, too, and unlike Balotelli he actually uses his strength against defenders. He can just push defenders on the ground like it ain't no thing. His technical abilities aren't bad at all. He has potential to be really great forward - pace, power, technique, heading ability, finishing. Only thing I'm not sure if he is an intelligent player.

I'm sure many agree that after seeing Lambert and Balotelli fail to fit in here we have to be very careful of buying a forward that's somewhat similar to their type. Especially for that kind of money. 

Villa don't have players like Coutinho so I couldn't say how he'd work with players like that. That's my biggest doubt. Coutinho is probably our best player and we have to use his abilities as much as we can.

null,false,iamnotthepizza,,Year 11,null,"Note: I'm going to answer the question first without my books in front of me, then below I'll check and add the right stuff.

The source is a cartoon by Soviet artist in 1938. This was the year that the Munich Agreement (29 September 1938) was signed, where Stalin was not allowed in. It's quite biased because it's a Soviet cartoon, so it can only show the Soviet side of the Agreement. The purpose of the source to is show how the Munich Agreement is going to hurt Russia by using Hitler to destroy Russia. Stalin was not allowed in the Munich Agreement, and at the Agreement Daladier and Chamberlain gave Hitler the Sudetenlands to appease him, which would have worried Stalin that they were giving more land and more chance to take over Eastern Europe.  

I disagree with the interpretation because at the Munich Agreement, they didn't have Stalin there because all three leaders were anti-communists and Hitler would not agree to talk if Stalin was there. Also I disagree because Chamberlain and Daladier weren't trying to destroy Russia with this Agreement, they were merely trying to gain ""peace with honour"". Chamberlain had Hitler sign the Anglo-German Declaration which was an agreement that both countries saw it in their best interests not to go to war. Clearly the Munich Agreement was not to send Hitler to destroy Russia, but to prevent another world war over a small section of land in the Czechoslovakia.

So that would be my answer. Bitesize and johndclare.net mention the fact that Czechoslovakia were allies with Russia, so I would improve my answer my talking about the fact that the Munich leaders were jeopardising the Russian's military ally and how the source shows that Russian didn't agree with the Agreement because of this.

Evaluation of the provenance of the source: it is a Soviet cartoon and therefore

Munich Agreement; explains the theory of appeasement; the reasons why
Chamberlain and Daladier were desperate for peace; the effect that the

to ally themselves with the USSR in 1939; Hitler did have designs on USSR

&gt;A __country__ is a region identified as a distinct entity in [political geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_geography). A country may be an independent [sovereign state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state) or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-[sovereign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty) or formerly sovereign [political division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_division), or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated [peoples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation) with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the [League of Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Nations) in 1937 and reaffirmed by the [United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations) in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction.

Your error here is in assuming that it's OK to hang around until a job comes up in your desired industry. It is not. Get a job outside your desired industry, so that the rest of us don't have to support you, and then continue in your spare time to hunt for a job in your desired industry.

This was a national role and the criticism of her for 'not speaking out', well where are all the other professionals that didn't speak out? And who is making the accusation?

&gt;Instead, her report – branded ‘hysterical’ and ‘highly emotional’ – said simply that abuse is carried out by men of all backgrounds.

Who branded it that? 

Also it appears that this woman is 61 years old. So her redundancy, four years off the national retirement age, is probably as a result of a package that buys out senior civil service staff, which in itself will save money in the long run against final salary pensions. 

If the Civil Service are prepared to hire her back as a consultant they will still be saving money on other perks and don't have to employ her if there is no work to do.

Eliminate harsh anionic surfactants (sulphates, olefin sulfonates), alkaline soap, drying alcohol. Consider products you apply directly, also ones like shampoo where the bubbles contact your skin as you shower. Also take shorter and less frequent showers: over wetting or soaking the skin flushes out the skin's natural moisturising factors.

Use products containing ingredients known to be deficient in dry or winter skin: ceramides and other skin identical lipids, urea and other natural moisturising factors. Good brands/ products include Eucerin, CeraVe cream in the tub or PM lotion with niacinamide (Amazon), Superdrug Simply Pure hydrating serum, Flexitol hand balm and foot cream (can be used on the whole body). Nivea creme has lanolin, which is excellent for dry skin.

Water alone does not hydrate you, in fact excessive intake can flush out minerals/ electrolytes. Ideally get much of your water from plenty of fruit and veggies - most countries advocate seven to nine servings a day now.

The body needs a raft of nutrients including essential fatty acids and minerals/ electrolytes to hold onto that water. Ensure you consistently meet or exceed ALL our government's recommendations for healthy eating. Mineral rich foods include seeds, nuts, beans and lentils: the official guidelines remind us to 'eat a wide variety' because each supplies a different range of nutrients.

Experts advocate up to four serving a week of oily fish, this supplies far more than just the omega-3s in fish oil capsules: vitamin D, B group vitamins, certain minerals. Vitamin D rich foods are especially important when using sunscreen or in winter - in the UK we cannot make vitamin D from sunlight October to April. See the 'sun protection'  article in the sidebar for more on this.

IN:

* Ings
* Milner
* Benteke (or anyone really)
* CM, Illaramendi maybe? Just rumours, but that rumour has been around for a while.
* GK, Neto?
* Right back. Haven't heard anyone being linked, and don't know any obvious choices. edit: KCCJacksGhost named Trippier, I actually think he would be a solid choice.
* That 21 year old left back from Everton, Garbutt? There were some rumours, although I wouldn't know if we should get him as we already have Moreno.

The highest profile signing would be the striker, currently only Benteke has been in the rumours, there's a lot of time for this to change. The others would barely make out a significant figure. Would it be acceptable summer if things went like this? Better depth to many positions, couple of players that should be able to fit in nicely right away. Maybe a bit underwhelming for some, I know many want big names in, but I just can't see it happening, maybe only for the striker's position.

Out (some pretty obvious ones): 

* Johnson
* Jones
* Gerrard 
* Borini
* Lambert 
* Balotelli

Maybe forgot someone. Kolo will stay for experience and cover? We could also look at Ilori.

There is nothing with a known percentage of retinol available in stores the UK, and nothing at all with retinaldehyde AFAIK. I would not personally bother with the retinyl esters, there is little research and they are very weak.

I have been tested a few Ishtar Skinlights products: they have a 1% serum and a 2.5% moisturiser. You would not slather the latter on like a real moisturiser - I have been mixing one pump with other products so that it spreads to my whole face, neck and decollete.

They also have the sodium ascorbyl phosphate form of vitamin C at percentages from 15% (lotion) to 20% (serum): the lotion certainly mixes in the hand fine with their retinol moisturiser. SAP has more research in acne than anti ageing tho.

If you prefer L-ascorbic acid there is the SR Skincare serum at 10% or the Active Formulas at 15%. Active Formulas also has a MAP serum (Lets Make Collaen) with good partner ingredients for anti ageing.

Most things that I found with decent percentages in stores is in one of the three vitamin C [Wiki entries] (http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionuk/wiki/ingredients) but again there is only a very limited amount with stated percentages. The M&amp;S serum has 4% AA-2G but not even any vitamin E so it is a bit of a one trick pony.

&gt;Your error here is in assuming that it's OK to hang around until a job comes up in your desired industry. It is not. Get a job outside your desired industry, so that the rest of us don't have to support you, and then continue in your spare time to hunt for a job in your desired industry. Don't say ""but if I'm working I won't be able to look for another job"" because that's utter rot. People with jobs who want to change jobs do that all the time.


I'm not oblivious. I would have gotten a job outside my niche if I hadn't applied and been told I'd received a decent contract for a multi-national corp a few months ago, only to have it postponed repeatedly due to legal disputes and beurocracy. Felt a bit pointless getting a help desk job when my recruiter keeps telling me they'll have a contract the next week. 

&gt;And if I'm reading this correctly in context, you got your degree in Obscure Arts and *have not worked since*, so it's not really right to say that ""I work in a small industry ..."".

Not that it really matters, but my degree was related to digital security, not ""Obscure Arts"", if you were trying to make the assumption that I'm in an industry that supposedly doesn't contribute anything valuable, and since graduating I've had a relevant internship. For what it's worth I've got interviews lined up too but it's an incredibly competitive environment.

The thing is they can't for a whole bunch of legal reasons, and charities don't like perishable food (for obvious reasons), which is most of what gets thrown away unless it's damages.

The vast majority of people are so picky about dates it's unreal, it's not just the super markets. They'll not buy green bananas with a couple of days on them yet they'll go buy undated banana from a market. I regularly see people outside all the fresh bread because it's got a one day date and then they'll ask why it's always so poorly dated.

Slightly damaged tin? No thanks, a bit of blackness on a banana (that's not a bruise, or sugaring fruit) no thanks. Slightly crushed cereal box? No thanks. Oh the meat has been turned upside down and there's colouring on the top of the package? No thanks. Milk that doesn't have a 10 day shelf life that I'm going to consume in a few days anyway? No thanks. Meat with two days on that you're not going to eat until the weekend anyway so it can be frozen? No thanks, bin.

It's not just the supermarkets, people have been fooled into thinking they need everything perfect looking, all vegetables super vibrant with no weird shapes or discolouring, freshly made products with the same dates as products loaded with preservatives, no damaged cardboard, all granny smith apples to have perfect white spots (I am not joking) and on and on. 

As a result people refuse to buy, yet they want the supply and choice. Low and behold a fucking mountain of waste, every single day that's hard to sell reduced because people still don't want it for stupid reasons. The shops may as well waste it because they are already making peanuts on stock and nothing on reductions.

Seriously, there needs to be a huge change in regards to how people persevere food. I was trying to tell someone you can keep potatoes, bagged up in a cool, dry and dark place and they'll last for an entire season (people do this all the time across europe with all sorts of produce), but no, straight in the bin.

&gt; I’ll never fully shake that sense of absolute impotence when destiny is at work. The feeling will cling to my feet forever, trying to pull me down. Even now if I mess up a pass, that malign force could be to blame. For that reason, I steer well clear of the DVD from the Liverpool game.
&gt; 
&gt; It’s an enemy that I can’t allow to wound me a second time. It’s already done enough damage: most of it hidden far from the surface.
&gt; 
&gt; I’ll never watch that match again. I’ve already played it once in person and many other times in my head, searching for an explanation that perhaps doesn’t even exist.
&gt; 
&gt; It was suggested we hang a black funeral pall as a permanent reminder on the walls of Milanello, right next to the images of triumph. A message to future generations that feeling invincible is the first step on the path to the point of no return.
&gt; 
&gt; Personally, I’d add that horrendous result to the club’s honours board. I’d write it slap bang in the middle of the list of leagues and cups they’ve won, in a different coloured ink and perhaps a special font, just to underline its jarring presence.
&gt; 
&gt; It would be embarrassing but, at the same time, it would enhance the worth of the successes alongside.
&gt; 
&gt; There are always lessons to be found in the darkest moments. It’s a moral obligation to dig deep and find that little glimmer of hope or pearl of wisdom.
&gt; 
&gt; You might hit upon an elegant phrase that stays with you and makes the journey that little less bitter. I’ve tried with Istanbul and haven’t managed to get beyond these words: *for fuck’s sake.*

Well funnily enough in a nation of 65 million people you're going to get a spectrum of beliefs from out-and-out republicans to those who'd like to see a return to the days of absolute monarchy. But I'd suggest that for the majority of people, they don't even think about the monarchy from one week to the next, only really being aware of its existence when something newsworthy happens (a new royal baby, for example).

Otherwise people are generally largely ambivalent towards it, as people all round the world are always ambivalent to something that has no particular effect on their lives one way or the other.

You might as well ask ""What do the American people think about Walmart"" -- some people love it, others hate it, the majority probably don't have any strong opinions other than to think ""well it's nice to know it's there just in case"". But most days they don't sit around the dinner table having long discussions or arguments about Walmart, and most days Brits don't think or talk about the monarchy at all.",null,0,null,1432392302,null,0,1432392431,0,crig601,null,t3_36zjcg,null,t1_crig601,null,t1_crig2i4,null,null,null,1433224510,null,19,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,19,null

Also, there's a time and a place for saying what I said above and it's not when they're about to kill themselves..


For all those here who have come across my post while standing on the edge of a building, checking reddit for the last time... Well I never could have predicted anyone would do such a thing. But since you're on the edge of a building, good going. You're less of an arsehole than the guy jumping in front of the train but probably still more of an arsehole than the guy who just hanged himself in his house.

Anyway, if I saw a guy being suicidal next to a train track I might actually use the 'don't fuck up everyones day' excuse to try and reason with him. It's as good a negotiation tactic as any in my book. They clearly don't care about themselves if they're about to commit suicide, so your main bargaining chips would be how it'll impact other people. 

Finally, there'd be nothing wrong with me recording it with my phone if that's what I wanted to do. Surely it's worth getting the last moments of someones life on film.

The problem that Rafa has is that his way of working is quickly diminishing.

Hi fellow Liverpool fans! I'm an entrepreneur and I'm continuously thinking of cool things we can do to make our world better. The tribute Steven Gerrard received at Anfield was incredible and it just shows how much he is respected. I think we can carry this tribute on and help raise money for the Steven Gerrard Foundation at the same time.

Rather like the ALS ice bucket challenge, lets create a short selfie video thanking Steven for his incredible contribution to our club, nominate other Liverpool fans to do the same, and donate to the SGF. I think this is an incredible way to not only thank him but also help out his wonderful charity.

Players like Cristiano Ronaldo have made a video thanking him, now its the turn of the fans: US!

Neither side can really produce valuable statistics, but it's easy enough to debunk what both sides are putting forward. For example on immigration: whatever happens immigration will probably remain high though because we have a service economy and more people will lead to growth. This growth in turn will lead to us being able to gain more money to invest in other areas. So, it's not exactly likely to happen. If at any point our population starts to shrink our economy will do so, and we'll lose the ability to borrow at current rates.

Almost every country in the world is joining a political and trade bloc in some capacity. With the African Union, ASEAN, Union of South American Nations, the Gulf Co-Operation Council, NAFTA, the Eurasian Economic Union, CARICOM, all pushing towards an outcome similar to what the European Union is headed towards. This mass adoption of similar schemes would indicate that there is certainly value to economic and customs unions.

Lamps was offered a terrible contract if he got one at all (it must have been because he said he would have loved to stay) he was probably going to get almost no playtime with the new signings coming in and mourinho specifically stating that he wanted to focus on the younger players like oscar and that lampard getting playtime would hinder their development. He wasn't ready to stop.. He's a fucking football player and wanted to keep playing in top flight european football and he's already proved he's good enough. This season he has the best goal to minute ratio of any midfielder in the league. If not for Lampard, our gap between city would be increased by 9 points. Just like how cole made the right choice in going to roma (even though he didn't do so well) why should we blame Lampard? Mourinho was literally going to give him zero minutes. That's actually one of the few gripes i've had with mourinho this season, I think lampard's experience would have proven very beneficial for us this season, for games where we badly need a goal and need someone who can actually fucking shoot from outside the box. His unique ability to score goals is not one that decays as quickly with age as much as some other players. His positioning, intelligence and shooting ability were all still there.. but anyways this is all besides the point.

And its not the same situation as gerrard at all. Gerrard's not even good enough anymore, that's why he's leaving unlike lampard who still felt he wasn't ready to retire to the MLS. If chelsea was as bad as liverpool(god forbid), you can bet lampard would have stayed because he would've actually got to play. 

The title of the article reads: ""Has Chelsea great Frank Lampard been forgotten buy the Premier League?"" and its true. He has been forgotten. He *is* a premier league legend. He's the 4th highest scorer ever in the league as a *midfielder*, top 10 in europe over the last 10 years.. He absolutely deserves at least *some* recognition by the media. No shit he isn't getting a sending off like gerrard. That's a given. No one expected him to get one like that after he moved to city. Not even fucking Giggs or scholes recieved something like that.

In *Pandorica* those weren't just Daleks - those were supposed the ships of almost every alien race the Doctor had come across, the Daleks were just a small contingent. The closest regular episode (excluding the anniversary special, which is understandable because it takes place during the Time War) that comes to the scale you're complaining about is *Asylum*.

&gt; adjective

&gt; (of a person, action, or motive) lacking consideration for other people; concerned chiefly with one's own personal profit or pleasure.

I can see why you'd call it selfish.  But don't think for a moment people a lot of people who consider suicide don't think about other people's feelings.  Often, it can be what keeps them from doing it.

Suicide is a final option.  If successful, there's no going back or regrets.  Their minds are so tortured, they can't live another day because it brings so much pain.  Lots of times, people stay alive and don't go through with the plans attacking their mind because it would hurt other people who would live after their death.

We don't live in a country where someone can legally end their own life, so they can't talk about it with friends and family and give their reasoning.  

It's selfish to kill yourself.  But it's also selfish to expect someone to live through years of wanting to kill themselves every second of every day, and be held back because they don't want to upset someone.",null,0,null,1432403454,null,0,false,0,cril0dt,null,t3_36zgkc,null,t1_cril0dt,null,t1_criix9x,null,null,null,1433226873,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

Have a look at this video showing how Dortmund discuss targets. (Around 1:20)

Compare that to our own:

Rodgers

Ayre

Fallows

Edwards

Gordon

Hunter


There's just far too much people there each who want their own say. So that leads to confusion but also messing about voting  and too time consuming. Furthermore, there's no football men on the board apart from Rodgers (to my opinion). Nobody there has played the game or knows exactly how Rodgers wants to play the game save Rodgers himself and he I think has a suspect eye for a player. That's why you end up getting players like Balotelli, because they probably look at his past and present and his metrics rather than how he fits in at a Rodgers' Liverpool.

Get a DoF in, or a sporting director, and I could guarantee we would have more succesfull transfers.
