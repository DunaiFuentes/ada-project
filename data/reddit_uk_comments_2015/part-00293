I know this sub loves to talk about how underrated Mikel and Ramires are, but truthfully whenever they've played next to Matic with Cesc as a 10, we've looked awful creatively and ball movement is slow with our front 4 barely getting a look in. 

I agree Mikel is a good player for closing out games when we're up 2-0 with 15 minutes left, and I agree Ramires has had some fine moments in a Chelsea shirt, but they simply don't cut it when Matic already is lacking in the passing department. 

I basically said this in another thread; Matic is an incredible player who is not only brilliant at breaking up opposition counters, but can also go past people easily and start counters of our own. However, his passing is definitely lacking and passing between the lines pretty much never happens from him. With Cesc next to him this is no problem, as Cesc can control the game from deep, but with Ramires or Mikel... it poses a problem. 

Motta next to Matic instead of Mikel/Zouma/Ramires in the big games would allow us to move Cesc to 10 and have a more solid defence, but Motta's passing ability and intelligence would allow us to not give up too much of the ball.",null,0,null,1438305471,null,0,false,0,ctm9lzq,null,t3_3f7vj6,null,t1_ctm9lzq,null,t1_ctm56w7,null,null,null,1440190894,null,5,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,5,null

Or among English Football fans. Or they are considered crimes of ""passion"" where anger overrules common sense. 

You mentioned that these were the rates in Pakistan, so they would require adjustment for UK.

I repeat. The NWFP is completely lawless because WE created it. We encouraged Pakistan to keep it lawless. It's where the Mujahadeen came from. When Indiia bitched about terrorists we told them ""it wasn't us"" until those same wankers killed white people (who weren't commies). We helped spread the virulent wahabbi ideal there and now it's come back to bite us because we are stupidly short sighted. 

Pakistan's problem is that. We created a massive problem of violence, armed them and encouraged their leaders to keep them stupid and hopped up on fundie Islam. Now we are mad because it's biting us in the foot. 

Sure. And there is tonnes of spousal abuse among White, Black, Indian families too. And those are counted as DV more than honour crime though. 

I am saying that the UK has had them too. Protestant vs Catholic? Football Violence? We still see gangs of youths fighting on weekends although it is better these days with the death of the Firms. It's mostly tits in bars. Honour crime is getting smaller and smaller and part of the problem is how we classify such crimes. There is a major element to race when such a crime is classified. You could get angry and stab your wife for looking at another man. Then it's an inherent problem with you. If you were Asian we would be looking at Honour Crime.

Two points: 1) These people are directly responsible for their own predicament. They are able, at any time, at any moment, to claim asylum in France.

They have travelled through countless friendly countries where they would not be persecuted, to Calais in an attempt to better their lot. 2) These people are bad.

Now these thing happen because the close families you describe place the 'honor' of the family over the wellfare of the victim.

To all the migrants in France trying to break into the lorries coming in, threatening drivers, setting stuff on fire and just generally causing hell and not letting the trains run. Someone even died this week. It's not cool.

It's meant that our motorways are being used as lorry parks for the tens of thousands of lorries entering Europe, all other motorway traffic is being diverted through our local towns and villages, causing traffic hell pretty much everywhere. It's currently taking up to 3 hours to do a 25 minute journey to/from work and some of our hotels have been booked out by the council for past illegal immigrants who have already broken through. The younger ones loiter in gangs, threaten people and treat the local area like they're entitled to it.

Typically 15-11 is very tightly contested for the best of the rest. I think the major battles for league position that will be decided by only a few points will be 10-6. Between Crystal Palace, Southampton, West Brom, West Ham, and Swansea, all of these teams have managed to remain solid, and pick up a few key players. I think the middle of the table will continue to strengthen and wreak havoc for the top third of the league, reducing the overall number of games which most teams consider ""almost guaranteed wins,"" because we all know, nothing is guaranteed in football. 

League Winner: Chelsea... Again. Just too strong, unless City make some major moves and Aguero finds the magic potion to become injury free. 

Golden Boot: Aguero (21)

POTY: Harry Kane - Harry will be tightly marked and show off his excellent offensive instinct and his assist numbers will benefit from improved performances from Chadli, Lamela and Eriksen. (16 goals, 9 assists) 

YPOTY: Mitrovic. Huge under the radar signing from Newcastle and can bang in the goals. (13 goals)

I think we'll be nipping at City's heels for that 4th position but just come up short due to City's quality and financial status over us.

Liverpool will underwhelm again without the locker room presence of Gerrard and will suffer from changing their team too much.

Bournemouth are going to get smashed. Spent too much on Mings and I don't think Distin has anything left in the tank for them. Can't see them staying up.

Stoke will impress everyone with a fit Bojan, a rejuvenated goal scorer in Charlie Adam, and cheeky new signing Ibrahim Afellay.

It'll be a three horse race for the title and Chelsea will come out on top.

Southampton suffer after losing Schneiderlin, Clyne, and Alderweireld.

Anyone can marry anyone - but gay married couples and straight married couples lose all their economic privileges that gay and straight people who do not want to marry don't have. Because it's not a fight for equality it's a fight for a privilege. 

Increased freedom of speech, expression, and right to hate ""the other"" for all. Hate crimes no longer exist unless it's physical [I.e personal harm, threat to harm, or property damage]. You can say and think what you want.

A move from a mandatory power sharing agreement between wankers to an actual democracy that involves the public good, meritocracy and a miniature service based economy that would generally revolve around manly things. MLAs pay reduced to that of the average wage. Increase minimum wage to a ""living wage"" of say £7.50 an hour, with a reduction in taxes people should have more disposable income.  

Abortion legal, prostitution legal, most drugs no longer prohibited. Religion plays no part in the public realm - so shops open when they want, booze and drugs sold when they want. 

Dig all the gold out of Stormont and put it into R&amp;D for science and technology.

Is your argument that everyone is at fault for what their ancestors did then? Do the royal family have a grievance against us for Charles I? What about other countries that did us wrong? Should we hold that against them? What violence are you even referring to anyway? 

Your guardian articles fail to go into detail on what the Royal Family is accused of spending too much on, they only say too much is spent on servants. Who would presumably join the ranks of the unemployed were she to cut back on that. Where will the extra jobs for them come from?

The countries she visits diplomatically don't see her as a negative reminder of past transgressions. Which you think is largely irrelevant anyway since diplomatic missions count less than business missions. 

In reagards to your problem with funding the monarch, tough tits. You don't get much of a say where your tax is spent. I would prefer more of it went to education and the arts but there we are. I can only vote for who I want to represent me and then be satisfied with the result and what they say. That is democracy after all. 

The royal family does much more than waving, writing memos and having children, reducing it that is just silly. In any case, to deny Kate her part in the spewing of progeny is unfair. 

In the end it doesn't really matter what you say, the country on large wishes to keep the monarchy so they will be kept.

However I respect all these player for their loyalty, determination to play for the first team or achieving their lost status, but you, I and everyone needs to accept the truth, they don't fit into our plans.

He wasn't really a Corinthians player, he just trained a bit there, in Brazil, after high school. However, when he came back to Japan, he only managed to find regional league clubs, and then even moved to Futsal for a while. His career was going nowhere. 

So, he tried to find some minor club in Europe and he landed in Astra in 2007. Astra was in the third division, in Romania. He obviously did not speak a word of romanian. However, just when he arrived, the club started to invest and actually earned a double promotion, so he suddenly found himself in the first division.

Despite the squad being revamped to prepare for the first division, he was still there, and starting matches. In 2010-2011 he was the captain for a while, and in that same season he received a big big offer from Al Nasr. 

He refused.

In 2013, he received another big money offer, this time from Qatar. Despite being 27 by then, he refused again. Shortly after, staff of the japanese national team went to scout him at the stadium for the first time.
In an interview - http://www.dolce-sport.ro/fotbal/fotbal-intern/seto-a-refuzat-petrodolarii-din-qatar-daca-urmaream-banii-nu-veneam-la-astra-pe-250-de-euro-23671/ - while talking about his reasons for refusing, he also revealed that he was making 250€/month back when he joined Astra.

I pointed out that possession of child pornography convictions are mostly white, not to argue that whites are committing lesser crimes, but to point out they probably aren't the result of white people speaking up. And that's what's being debated in this thread: cultural responses to abuse--who turns a blind eye?  

&gt;The statistics support your apologetics no more that they support my conclusions, and studies by people trying to tackle child abuse don't support your conclusions. 

So you're conceding your strident conclusions are as bad as my qualifications? My whole point was that the statistics support neither conclusion. If you have studies that support your claims then you ought to use them instead of using these statistics to give the veneer of authority to conclusions which simply don't follow.

&gt;rates of conviction for sexual activity with a child (2011) are much higher for whites - 90% of cases in which ethnicity was recorded, with a population percentage of 86%.

This is also a statistic that could just as easily support the claim that whites tend to report such cases to the police and others don't--*the exact opposite of turning a blind eye*. Anecdotally, as seen in the article I linked, Pakistanis are reluctant to involve the police for cultural reasons. And, anecdotally, I have heard that the police can be useless in dealing with disputes between people of foreign cultures, and that sours them on the police generally. And I have already argued other points that maybe whites aren't speaking up relatively more. And yet you want to call these 'obfuscations'. But the point is incredibly obvious: data about convictions is comprised not of those who commit offenses but of those who commit offenses *and are reported to the police*.

And I would add that on-street child prostitution gangs, which we've seen have their own ethnic distribution (according to http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/factcheck-grooming-gangs/18739, of those whose ethnicity is known, 21% are all-white gangs)--almost none of the hundreds of clients have been convicted.",null,0,null,1438321667,null,0,1438332849,0,ctmhzjz,null,t3_3evr1y,null,t1_ctmhzjz,null,t1_ctlbhw8,null,null,null,1440194907,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

David J Lloyd was a [local rail campaigner](http://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/train-named-after-rail-stalwart-2834166) who helped improve services on the Chester - Shrewsbury line and was very supportive of the idea behind WSMR.

null,false,GreyShuck,tom-baker,Tom Baker,null,"I picture things like this:  

* There is the pre-war version of the universe: you can travel to the distant past, or the far future, there are a scattering of travelling Time Lords, and also Daleks here and there. You can visit Gallifrey. The first moves of the time war happen here (Day of the Daleks, Genesis of the Daleks, Remembrance of the Daleks etc), but nothing too “hot” – it is pretty much a cold-war at most. There may be numerous sub-versions/timelines of this pre-war universe, but they are all still pre-war.  

* Things then kick off, and the war heats up. There are battles and covert operations by both side throughout time and space. Time-lines get overwritten again and again. The web of time begins to unravel and horrific things (reapers are the least of it) begin to intrude. Ultimately the final Dalek forces converge on Gallifrey, and Gallifrey falls. Pretty much at this point, the time lock occurs. It acts to seal off all the events in this paragraph from affecting anything in the old version(s) of the universe or the version to come afterwards. I picture it as a canyon stretching across a plain. Anything in the canyon can’t get out to either side and nothing can get down into the canyon, but a side effect is that nothing can travel from one side of the plain to the other either.  

* Then there is the post-war version of the universe: the version that we see in NuWho. Again one can travel to the distant past or far future, but you won’t find any Time Lords in this version, or be able to reach Gallifrey or any point Gallifrey’s history (under most circumstances). In the earlier sub-versions of this universe, you won’t find any Daleks either. Anyone that you meet will at most know of the Time Lords or Gallifrey only as a historical thing, or perhaps as myth or legend. And that will be true regardless of what point in time you ask them.

I'd suggest using the opportunity to explore quite a bit of Scotland. Glasgow's the largest city so it's pretty well connected to most places. Edinburgh is only a 55min train journey, or you could also travel to the west coast and visit seaside places like Millport or Troon. I'd also suggest thinking about day trips to Loch Lomond or Stirling for the castle.

If you're focusing on Glasgow you'll find plenty of nightlife with clubs and bars and really good restaurants. The West end is where all the interesting ""cultural"" shit is, like the Kelvingrove museum and art gallery. I'd also look at what gigs are on at venues like King Tuts Wah Wah Hut or the Barrowlands.

null,false,steampunkunicorn,eng-Surrey,Surrey,null,"&gt;How are we in any way selling our democracy or values because of the Royal family?

Because the royal family, by its very nature, is undemocratic. They are unelected and completely immune to the will of the people, yet they sponge off the taxpayer and [even have a say in the laws that govern our every day lives](http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jan/14/secret-papers-royals-veto-bills), yet are [immune to having to explain themselves](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/the-royal-family-are-exempt-from-freedom-of-information-requests-and-can-veto-bbc-programmes-why-do-we-put-up-with-this-9956702.html). In what way is that *at all* democratic? It's not even transparent. It could even be a lot worse than this, but we cannot know due to the secrecy involved.

&gt;What values are opposed by us having a royal family?

Democracy for a start. Also equality &amp; equal opportunity. Transparency. Accountability. Fairness. You can't call your society ""fair"" if one group of people get into a position of power and unimaginable wealth just because of who their parents are, and *nobody* else can possibly ever achieve that. That's not fair. That's not democratic.

&gt;I don't think money has anything to do with it really.

Money has a LOT to do with it. We pay taxes. The royals sponge off those taxes.

&gt;A lot of people like having a royal family, its nice and affects incredibly little of my day to day life except when we get a day off for the coronation or a jubilee.

A lot of people are ignorant and/or idiots. Doesn't make them right. It does affect your day to day life, not in ways that are immediately apparent, but it does. Also, we can have days off for *non*-royal occasions, you know.

&gt;Who are you to judge?

A tax paying citizen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

&gt;Do you want the pennies back on your taxes that goes to the Royal family?

Ideally yes, and I'd like to see the royal family abolished and replaced with a democratic alternative.

* Visit [Glasgow University](http://www.gla.ac.uk/) - really cool building and views at the top.
* Loads of places to drink. If you are a Beer enthusiast, head on over to [WEST Brewery](https://www.westbeer.com/templeton/). Even if you aren't, its still a cool place to visit.
* [Merchant Square](http://www.merchantsquareglasgow.com/) is nice for drinks and dining also. Again if you like beer, the [beer cafe](http://www.beercafe.co.uk) in merchant square has quite a tidy selection of random beers.
* Botanical gardens is nice to walk about - especially if you get that random opportunity of sun. Also Kelvingrove Park &lt;- although don't walk through her at pitch dark unless with a group.

I'm telling you what happened and yes, it's shit, I'm still in a lawsuit with the other insurance company because there are certain things I refuse to accept re: personal injury as that is the permanent damage which is all I truly care about. 

What my lawyer said to me was this 50/50 liability was the best way to move on to avoid court and that if I did go to court I may lose because they could argue both parties are supposed to be on the lookout and even though it was my right of way they could argue I should have seen her too and stopped and then there would have been no accident. Obviously I wish that had happened but she came out of nowhere because she was going fast trying to get through and she didn't check for a motorcyclist in my lane clearly only looking for cars. They could argue a lot of things, me being a new driver, me being from the US with a fresh provisional license. I could see how they could poke holes in my argument regardless of the fact I knew I was right and on the advice of people who have a law degree and have done this before, I followed their advice. I've never been to court, and I have severe anxiety when put on the spot so going into a room like that with the pressure would tear me apart so I knew I couldn't go to court (and please don't say if everything was above board it would be fine because if you've never suffered from anxiety like that you don't understand -- it has no rational basis and that's not how it works).

Why is that not right? These people are getting paid to tell me what to do and there are consequences if they screw it up so why should I be distrustful of their opinion? Unless you're suggesting I sue my solicitors for giving me really bad advice, then tell me how to do that and I will consider it. Seriously, I'm still mad about being told I have to accept liability and if there was any way to change it I would go back and fight it but I wouldn't know the first thing on how to proceed.

null,false,Fewyfok,null,null,null,"Hmm. My personal opinion is that whilst model portfolios might be balanced, there might be a slightly ulterior motive in the funds that are recommended (the broker may get slightly more commission from the fund management company). Looking at the sample growth/high risk portfolio, my opinion is that the funds mostly have too high charges.

It's well worth reading up about active vs passive investing. This sub generally recommends mostly passive funds. I like to have a bit of a mix, as there are some areas I'd only feel comfortable having a manager actively control the fund, but I think a lot of those funds listed by Cavendish could be replicated better with passive investments. Some companies (e.g. Vanguard, there are others too) offer funds that are comprised almost soloely of other funds rather than investing directly into shares, which offer you a ready made balanced portfolio but with much lower charges. If you're concerned about getting the diversification element right by yourself, I'd recommend something like that as a starting point. I have to stress this is just my opinion though from my experience over the past year - you should only do something you are comfortable with, and that you yourself have researched enough to be happy you know where your money is going.

edit: regarding your other point, the price means how much it costs to buy 1 unit of that fund. Unlike stocks, you don't have to buy units in whole numbers e.g. you can buy 1.35 of a unit in a fund, which going by the £10.93 price would cost £14.76. There is also the sell price, which will always be a little lower than the buy price - known as the bid/ask spread. These prices will change daily as the individual stocks the fund is invested in go up or down.",null,0,null,1438328232,null,0,1438328637,0,ctmk63v,null,t3_3f3n37,null,t1_ctmk63v,null,t1_ctm2vwc,null,null,null,1440196001,null,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1,null

Birmingham University is located in Selly Oak (South of the City) and the first year accomodation is in and around Selly Oak. Second &amp; Third years tend to move into houses in Selly Oak which is now all but a Student Town. Post Grads tend to move to Harborne or Moseley which are quieter suburbs.

Birmingham City University is spread across Perry Barr &amp; City Centre Campuses, each has its own local accomodation. Perry Barr is a bit run down now but the City Centre Campus is all brand new. They also have some satellite campuses such as the Conservatoire for the arts.

Aston University borders the BCU City Campus and shares much of its accomodation. 

Then there's Newman University &amp; University College Birmingham which are a little more spread out, but I think students tend to use either the BCU or UB accomdation respectively.

Infrastructure needs improving for new transport methods (autocars and drones), retail is about to go through another shock with same day delivery expanding and that raises questions for town centres and high streets, automated manufacture means cost of labour is less important and technical skill required higher. 

A good quality infrastructure both physical and Internet along with help with investment in both moving to automated processes and in people through lifelong learning, capped off with world class research organisations, would go a long way to bringing manufacturing back to the UK. Green investment and house building also provide the sort of employment you need for a fairly long term and with the sort of jobs that help the people you want to help.

Hell, if we could find savings elsewhere to put in proper social care and mental health support for the whole populous, a whole new raft of jobs open up as well.

I'd love to see the UK with an economy built on digital goods, high tech manufacturing, green infrastructure and construction, life long education, health and social care and mental health support.

All are challenges other countries will be facing and developing countries will want to jump straight to in many cases. We have a chance to get out in front, especially in areas like computing, autocars, education and health where we have the skills to be world leaders already.

Nope, the world doesn't work like that. Maybe you would like it to, but right now it doesn't, and right now people need help. So what do you choose? Do you allow the criminals to settle here, or do you turn them away and instead only allow people who have made a genuine asylum application.

Its fine to have ideological views of how the world should be, but you also need to think about the actual application of what you want to achieve. How many people should we let into this country every year? How many houses can we build each year? If you plan on letting everyone in, you have to at least accept that you cannot let them all in at once. So how do you choose who comes first? 

Are you going to invite the people going through the legal channels to apply for asylum first? Of are you going to let the criminals in first?

 I assume you don't like it when someone cuts in front of you when you are queuing? Imagine how you would feel if you were queuing for a new life, and it could take years to get to the front. How would you feel about seeing people cut in front of you in that situation?

Celtic have their own TV channels which they get 100% of their proceedings. The big clubs have the biggest draw for fans. It would be unrealistic to think Celtic would give up their own platform for a chance at 8.33% of the SPL one.

How many fans we bring online is going to be hard to calculate. Lets take Youtube as an example.  Celtic have 37,000 youtube followers on their channel and the spfl as a whole has 50,000 (but how many are Celtic fans?) Celtic have more Youtube followers than every of SPFL clubs youtube channel combined.

The cuts would need to be hugely favourable to Celtic and Rangers when they get back for them to even consider it.

null,false,redem,,Ballymena,null,"A day isn't near enough. I would need years to do the things that I think need done. Mostly, running ideas past people who know what the fuck they're talking about so I don't fuck up too badly. I mean, what the fuck do I know about running a country?

First, I would like to negotiate significant welfare, regulatory and taxation reform powers from Westminster, in exchange I would probably have to accept a re-do of the barnett formula and block grant. Probably worth it, though they would probably not agree to give us the powers I would want, of course. As is, we're governed primarily by laws/regulations designed to benefit the interests of England and especially London, and the rest of us suffer for it.

My focus would be on reforming taxation, regulation and the legal system here to simplify and reduce red tape, bureaucracy and the sort of over-complication that only really benefit lawyers and accountants.

For the economy, that includes elimination of most forms of subsidies, hidden taxes, loopholes and fees for accessing government services, including all ""workfare"" bullshit. I am not sure how it is possible, but I would like to tax eliminate the dodgy business of companies here registering their profits elsewhere for the sake of reducing tax. Perhaps requiring that businesses operating in NI be registered here for taxation and excluding ""rent"" to parent companies from calculations of revenue and profit. This is one of the things I need experts to tell me if I am an idiot about. I would simplify VAT in so far as there would be only two rates, with fewer categories and exceptions.

I would create a land value tax and a carbon tax, payable at ""entry into the economy"" of Northern Ireland. i.e. at ports and borders by whoever is hauling. The carbon tax starting small, but increasing at a predictable % above inflation giving people time to invest in efficiency measures and alternatives to pollution. Revisit year on year to see how that's affect things.

I would remove the minimum wage entirely, compensating for that by having welfare, housing benefits etc... be available to anyone, working or not, based on income and assets, scaling down as income increases in a manner that always leaves you better off working more, smarter, harder, but always giving you the right to walk away from a shit job that isn't worth your time without penalty or punishment from the state. Replacing Pensions as well.

Regulations for businesses, buildings etc can be greatly simplified. Some of them eliminated. Right now we basically have regulatory pantomime. We go through the motions, file the paperwork and revisit them later. Take food prep places. Some do it right, others fill in a month's temp charts all at once guesstimating at the results. Inspectors don't know the difference, it's all pointless. The only people caught out are the truly stupid and incompetent. The current system is both expensive (in terms of economic effort needed for it) and barely functional. The only real solution is in person inspection happening regularly and unpredictably. With the  lack of a min wage that should be doable without breaking the bank, especially if it is regular short inspections, with irregular detailed ones. Much red tape can be moved online, of course and processed automatically without too much effort.

If there is any spare money in the kitty after loses and gains are counted up here, I would like to start building housing in large numbers, should be cheaper to do so than it is now with the changes to the cost of business from the reforms I mention here.

In all, the point is to reduce the cost of doing business in NI and to increase the cost of NOT doing business with assets owned here.

I don't know how to math that to see if the results would be worth the effort, but I suspect it would be a wash.

For the executive. I would make MLAs be decided by proportional voting for the country as a whole, no more representing local areas at all. A single vote for the whole country, we're small enough that we won't need to worry too much about the the centralisation issues this may cause. This will largely result in permanent coalitions. Hopefully sufficient to reign in the extremists like the DUP.
Local representation would be in your councils. Corruption in these is a problem of course, which needs addressed.

The civil service, might need gutted but I honestly have no idea if that's practical or what most of them actually do from day to day. Might need to hire more of them.

The lack of subsidies would include to groups that are not businesses, such as lodges and bands and so on. They will need to fund themselves, including covering the costs of reasonable policing of marches (i.e. no additional payment for riots kicked off, but the predictable cost of policing would be theirs). Each march would need to be organised by a single overarching group, they would be liable for the actions of all members of the marches. Including the risk of being banned from operating next year for people being cocks. You wanna march, keep your marchers in line.

Same with Bonfires. If you want one, you pay the predictable cost of clean up, fire brigade standby upfront, and for any damaged caused after the fact, and can only do so in approved locations. Failure to do so means no boney next year. If police dare not tear them down, the army should. And no more fucking tires, effigies, flags or stolen statues on them.

Services, Police, Fire, Health etc... I've no real objections to business as usual. I would like to end the war on soft drugs, at the least, mostly as a money saving effort.

Education, an end to grammar schools and a reform of the subjects taught is probably worth doing. I am undecided on whether catchment areas are a good idea or whether people should be able to apply to anywhere.

As it is, the main dream for people to succeed here is to go to Uni and then fuck off somewhere else to make a real living. It needs to be easier and clearer how to succeed here. More emphasis put on practical knowledge of the things people need to know to live. Including how to setup, operate and run a business, pay taxes, etc... With the land value tax, welfare reform and lack of a min wage to worry about, it should be easier to start a new venture here than anywhere else in the UK. But we still need the talent to do the work, so people need to be able to do the work and to know how easy it is to setup here and get started.

IT reforms are expensive as all hell, but I think they're important for efficiency's sake and the savings they bring in. Building on the current NIDirect site, publish as much online as is possible in plain English that anyone can read. If someone wants to add a translated version for Irish/Ulster Scots, they can submit that for approval and addition as a reference to the main page, but the operating standard as far as the law goes is the English one. The current website needs a significant navigation improvement to make that work. Not much point in publishing things that no one can find.

Assuming I can stay on after the reform is done, I would like to see it as a part of a constitutionally neutral party built around the idea of evidence-based policy making. i.e. We pay attention when we're told the drug laws are pointless and we need to change them rather than firing and vilifying our experts. Or that certain education policies are ineffective and expensive. Or that we need to enforce environmental regulations better because our waters are being polluted past what we aimed for.

For example, the London to Reading corridor is famously unreliable. Most of the problems with that line have nothing to do with the privately owned train operator, but instead with the state owned infrastructure (e.g. signalling problems, cockups due to ongoing electrification work).

Igor de Camargo - 32 y/o, Belgium international, tall striker who they just signed, probably their main man this season. But obviously aging. According to Fifa (I know...) he's very strong in the air, but not the most technical player. 

Siebe Schrijvers - 19 y/o very promising striker who just signed an extension. Can also play as a winger, which he did last match.

So list your top concerns. You aren't disadvantaged financially by immigration. How are you disadvantaged socially? Is your local high street teeming with burkahs? Are you worried that your kids will want to become Muslims? Maybe I'm being dense but  I fail to see  a problem.

My point and my experience is that integration happens - it just takes time. 

More from the way back machine for you - and see if you can find the social issue here.

Britain used to known as a nation of shopkeepers. Which was fine if you wanted to only shop from 9-5 (half day Wednesday of course and never Sunday).

As more Asians arrived and opened shops that traded 7 days a week they added a new element to living in any town. OMG, I can buy food on Sunday. Supermarkets grew and followed the same pattern and now we have genuine 7 day trading. Where I live in London this is also 24 hour in the larger Turkish supermarkets.

How do you measure the social impact of this? Was it bad that the Nation of Shopkeepers label disappeared. Has anyone even heard of it from the younger generation? Am I at any disadvantage due to the presence of these stores?

How can you even think that economic and social issues aren't intrinsically bound together? There's even a phrase for it... socio-economic....

null,false,Milemarker80,null,null,null,"I bloody love Glasgow.  Got the weekend up there this weekend, and it's one of the few cities outside of London that I could see myself living in.  It's just so 'livable' - with a bustling centre, chilled out west end, so many open spaces, water and so on.

Having said that, it's a city that appeals to an uh, certain type.  The music and arts scene are massive, great food and some great beers and bars, along with some fantastic outside spaces and cultural spaces.

My top of the head suggestions:

Check out Glasgow School of Art, maybe do one of their walking tours (http://www.gsa.ac.uk/visit-gsa/city-walking-tours/timetables-tickets/).  Charles Rennie Mackintosh, and his wife, Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh were prolific architects, artists and instrumental in the development of Glasgow as a cultural centre and the walking tours really show how much of an influence they had on the city.

Along similar lines, check out the recreation of the Mackintosh house at the Huntarian Museum, along with the University, Kelvingrove Park and the art museum there.  If you fancy more, check out House for an Art Lover down out of central town on the south side.

Glasgow Necropolis is a stunning, Victorian style cemetery on the west side of town by the Cathedral.

The nightlife is second to none - from Sub Club for the longest running night club in the world to Nice n Sleezys, Broadcast, Mono, Stereo, Old Hairdressers, 13th Note etc etc etc, there's something great happening just about every night.  RIP the Arches...

Food wise, I'd recommend Meat Bar, Crabshakk, Fanny Trollopes, Gamba, Hanoi Bike Shop, Ubiquitous Chip, Fish People and many more.  Bar wise - plenty of decent boozers around the West End, but also Munro's, Inn Deep and maybe controversially Drygate (owned by Tennants, but ok).

Also, if you haven't been to Edinburgh, I'd recommend a day trip over - I'm not such a fan, it's all a bit pretty pretty there, but the train is like £10 return and takes 30-40 mins, so it's an easy hop to do the highlights over there as well.",null,0,null,1438336018,null,0,false,0,ctmm813,null,t3_3f99zt,null,t1_ctmm813,null,t3_3f99zt,null,null,null,1440196968,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

When you start to actually apply the bank/building society do a bigger check and factor in all costs now you know the property you want. For me it was around £10,000 less that was originally quoted. But in you're case you've gone for a property much lower than your limit, so you'll be fine, but if you were to go up to £300,000, be careful when making an offer at your limit.

It's boring but read through all the paperwork. The solicitors will point anything anything unusual or worth your attention. But it's good to familiarise yourself with everything regardless. You want to avoid as many surprises as possible as you move in. 

If you're getting a house, get a building survey for sure! If you're getting a flat you can go home-buyers report, or if you're comfortable and brave you can save the £500 and just use the banks survey, but that doesn't go into much detail and only looks at the surface level, that survey is just done so they are happy with the valuation, it's not really for your benefit.

Edit: Also get a fixed mortgage contract and not variable. Interests rates are not going to get lower and are expected to rise next year.

null,false,stubble,null,London Arab,null,"&gt;  Do you just chalk it up to prejudice?

Frankly yes. As someone who grew up in a minority community and received racial abuse as a kid and a teenager I have no other way to interpret my experience. Things have definitely improved over the years though; attitudes have changed with each decade. 

It's an ongoing issue though. Many European countries simply don't have the same framework as the UK when it comes to minority issues; racism within Eastern Europe is horrendous.

The prejudice goes in both directions too, in many cases - there are members of my community who exhibit the most shocking attitudes towards Jews for example. They make excuses for this and blame it on the middle east conflict but, bottom line they are just prejudiced cunts. I actually dated a girl last year who was telling me how the Jews control the world through the banking systems;  this was someone with an education too. I was shocked to hear that from her. Needless to say that relationship went no further.

There are also more forward thinking people who realise that there are ways to re-evaluate their attitudes and not be so trapped by their grandparents' small-mindedness. The equivalent of your DM reading grandad who hates anyone not white exists in every community. They grow old and die and the next generation comes along that has grown up alongside a wider vista of people.

&gt;community nearby who are entirely isolationist and it feels a little bit offensive that they don't want to even talk to any of the other locals

Has anyone tried to set up a community forum with them? Dialogue with different groups can be very productive. Issues of language and culture can be addressed if you make the effort to create some sort of structured dialogue. Once you get to the place where you realise that the only thing anyone really wants is to be able to make  a decent living and get their kids a good education it becomes a little easier to find points of connection.

They werent taken on the tour so they have been training seperately for a while now. Loads of clubs do it especially when a player isn't making the effort to leave. Otherwise they are holding the club back and wasting wages. Look at Borini in one year he had turned down QPR who offered double his wages, Sunderland where he was before and Lazio a Champions league club in his home country.

Why would you make them train with the rest of the squad. If you was a coach at Liverpool you wouldn't have time for players who are leaving. The players are preparing for the new season and the upcoming friendlies, what's the point training Balo, Borini and Enrique for that. If you was a coach would you even bother with them? Would you go through the new formation and tactics with them? Of course not. The only reason they are training is for match fitness which every footballer can do alone. 

It's not exactly a big deal. I doubt the players up for sale care about training seperately.

Arsenal (in my opinion) have a better manager, better defence (bar keeper, but who the fuck knows if De Gea is staying), better midfield and better attack. United are on the brink of selling their record signing for like a 15m loss after 1 season, they paid the majority of Falcao's 300k/week wages and he did nothing for them. Their defence is still crap and with 8 days till the season starts I don't understand why they are hanging their hopes on Ramos and Otamendi. Valdes wants out (probably should have joined us in the first place), and their signings haven't been that amazing in my opinion. Maybe I am biased, but I swear I never even heard the name Darmian till United were linked with him, and now he is one of the best RBs in the world? Depay I think will be a good signing for them, but being good in the Dutch league doesn't always mean a lot (Babel). Schweinstieger is going to be 31 before the season starts, and despite being undoubtedly a great player, he isn't world class anymore. He missed so many games through injury in the past 4 seasons and wasn't to his best last season. He couldn't work with Alonso, so who knows if he can work with Michael 'best midfielder in the league' Carrick? Also, 31 is an old age to be adapting to a new league at. Schneiderlin is premier league proven and will likely be a good signing for them, but we said that about Lovren too. All their signings seem so conflicting and I don't see them getting any silverware. Also, am I the only one who thinks it is unprofessional LVG has come out and basically said he is leaving United after 16/17? He's probably going to end with nothing to show for but 3 100m+ transfer windows and a club with an average league finish of 4th.

That's not my argument at all, no need to take it to extremes. My point is that you're being naive if you think that the past doesn't count. I'm talking about centuries of oppression, the fact that our royal family are not even British. I think we should right wrongs, and we tend to be in the wrong. Hence us continuously giving other countries their freedom.

If you read that article - the Royal train service - totally necessary, can't travel with plebs. The servants could stay with them, if as you say they generate their own income they would be perfectly capable of doing so in the future. Otherwise, opening up all of the palaces, they can work in tourism / hospitality.

Sorry - not tough tits. I also didn't vote for the government that represents us, therefore am not required to be satisfied with the results or what they say, I don't think we live in a functioning democracy. All I can hope is that their PR show wanes, but they won't get the greasy claws off what they believe to be rightfully theirs without a fight I imagine. I'm sick and tired of them whinging on about hating the press when they abuse it so.

They actually really don't, they do some charity work, I don't see the queen attempting to assist in the bailout negotiations with Greece.

Out of curiosity, were the solicitors that you used appointed/recommended by your insurance company? Or did you decline the insurance company's offer and appoint your own solicitor?

I ask because there are some solicitors that are owned by the insurance companies that refer to them - potential conflict of interest - and you don't necessarily get represented by a qualified solicitor at all.

If you ignore the filtering incident bits of this blog post:
http://www.whitedalton.co.uk/motorbike-blog/2013/09/is-your-lawyer-really-on-your-side/

If you think you might have been misrepresented, it might be worth approaching a specialist motorcycle and/or legal malpractice solicitor and taking them up on a free 30 minute consultation.

As a result it's been kept hidden away and only used a couple of times, it's condition is essentially brand new and mint condition, with everything functioning perfectly. It holds a very impressive form factor as you can see in the image comparison with a Sony PlayStation 4.

Only as much as you are. I'm making the assumption that Vodafone has in some way sent out a statement of account by post or email, since that is what mobile phone companies do for virtually all accounts.

You're making the assumption that it hasn't once communicated with the account holder since the debt began to mount, which is substantially less likely.

Yes, Vodafone admits that it has not sent out a specific letter about the debt, but that doesn't mean it hasn't been sending the standard monthly statements of the account. If it has done so, and OP's girlfriend has not responded (as I suspect to be the case), Vodafone has not failed to mitigate.

Mitigating is not saying ""Hmm, this person isn't paying her bills. We'd better stop charging."" Mitigating in this case would be attempting to contact the account holder.

&gt;A Tobin tax could be a good idea, but ONLY if it is implemented worldwide on the same day. Good luck with that.

&gt;Britain's foreign earnings from financial services exceed £50 billion a year, more than the sum total of all other countries on earth combined. And the taxes paid on those revenues are what keeps schools and hospitals open.

&gt;P.S. The idea that the tax would raise £20 billion is absurd. The tax is optional. The business now done in the UK would be done elsewhere.

null,false,Miserygut,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,null,"UK planning has been eviscerated, underfunded, subjected to the fucking idiocy of local councillors (who are frequently corrupt as hell) and MPs, for the past three decades. We used to have a functioning system which built the garden cities before Thatcher shit all over it. New Labour maintained things but didn't really expand funding, instead dumping more legislation on top with no resources. Last parliament they took a hatchet to decades of legislation to streamline things, that didn't improve housebuilding in the slightest. They've done the same again this paliament by cutting what little legislation was left and it won't help this time either. We're building slums of the future! Hurrah!

&gt;Sometimes builders have to build a new access road for an estate... But never a school. There's a problem here. Also the asthetics... Straight lines, red brick... Morroco and Spain do better job in that department.

This is an interesting problem because businesses have been totally unable to get loans from banks for infrastructure. Banks simply don't want to lend on the kind of timescales that infrastructure requires (25 - 50+ years). 

A few years ago the Department for Communities and Local Government's Housing policy arm set up a way of loaning out money for infrastructure projects. Within the space of two years they were loaning out *billions* of pounds and realised this was something that needed a lot more resources putting into it. All the loans are backed by government bonds so it means local government and housebuilders can access cheap, abundant credit for long periods of time. Right now it has loaned out more than £30 billion (probably £40 billion by the end of the year) to build roads, put in sewers and that kind of thing. We should have been doing this back in 2008 when the country was dying on it's feet for jobs and building but... Better late than never.

The aesthetics have little / nothing to do with the Town Planners. That is 99% down to the architects employed by the private sector. Usually it's whatever is cheap; timber and breeze blocks structure with a red brick skin is cheap. In Conservation Areas the Planning department might require the design to be sufficiently sympathetic to the local architecture.

&gt;Land price. Builders say the price is high thus less budget for the build, rather than cost to build looks smaller. Sounds to me like people living here are too poor.

Land prices have risen immensely, yes. Logically we either need to build up (not so good with less-wealthy clients, awful for social housing) or build outside of towns which means we need infrastructure and transport links from those areas to where the jobs are. People living here are not too poor. Housebuilders just have no interest in serving the bottom 60% of the market because the margins are too small. Housebuilders aim for 15%+ returns on the average project because of the cyclical nature of housebuilding they need to make hay while the sun is shining. The government *could* help here by extending access to cheap credit but then they're directly subsidising the private sector's profit margin - it's cheaper just to build more social housing directly at that point. They are choosing to do neither, fuck the electorate.

&gt;Are prices speculation from outside. Or speculation from inside the country? Or is it supply and demand? Or both? Nobody seems to know... There's are some studies but I didn't see any covering both factors in one study.

Both inside and out. Cheap credit inside means people don't baulk at borrowing 5 - 6x earnings for a mortgage. Cheap credit outside means people want a safe, steady return for their investments. Have a look at what illgotten Chinese fortunes have done to Vancouver's property market - it's even worse than London's. There's also a chronic lack of supply so naturally that's a good speculative move for investors inside and outside of the country.

&gt;UK prices seem high... Until you see the rest of the world. Is it a anglophone phenomenon? This is a empire so the effect can look global.

Putting it into context; the UK is among the wealthiest nations on Earth. It shouldn't be unreasonable that the average citizen here can afford to buy a property, or rent something *really* nice for a reasonable price. The reality is that the UK has failed to build sufficient housing for decades, that's why our prices are so high. The average person cannot really afford a property near to where they work outside of relatively cheap areas.

&gt;Do we have to reach into the quiet corners of the world to escape this post British empire 'an englishmans home is his castle' export' to figure out if the use of houses as a store of wealth is from this? If so, where are the places in the world most insulated from the west? Iran, Russia, China. What are house prices here in these places most economically insulated? How's about Islamic countries like Indonesia?

Nope. The underlying factor is that credit is too cheap and too abundant. Investors are scrabbling to get returns and honestly, it's going to end very badly when the music stops.

He was an impressive speaker, and a powerful public figure on the back-benches against the Iraq war and other issues, but that doesn't mean he was a good or even decent politician when in a position of power. From one of Denis Healey's staffers (obviously biased, but it gives you an idea):

&gt;  Benn never dealt with any objection, principled or practical, to any part of his programme. For example, he assumed that Britain's European partners would be eager to help us leave the (then) European Community overnight, and shut out their goods from our markets while leaving their markets open to ours.

...

&gt; Benn and his supporters constantly peddled a false narrative of the previous Labour governments, and his own role in resisting its 'surrenders' to the IMF and other international capitalist conspirators. They encouraged the de-selection of MPs simply for supporting decisions by that government and its ministers.

...

&gt; Benn and his followers claimed to be bringing democracy to the Labour party. As widely noted at the time, it was a peculiar democracy which always stopped short of giving a vote to the rank-and-file members of local parties, trade unions and other affiliated bodies, who they claimed to represent. [This is something which only happened under Ed Milliband]

...

&gt; Benn followed the long-established pernicious maxim of ""no enemies on the Left"" so that no one, however obnoxious, undemocratic or plain silly, was excluded from his coalition. He consistently defended the right of the Trotskyite Militant Tendency to use the Labour's party organisation, money and good name, ignoring the fact that Trotsky hated the Labour party all his life and urged his followers to join it only to subvert it.

&gt; I listened to Benn at meetings and never once heard him repudiate any stupid or extreme remark from a sympathizer on the floor. He had a characteristic response: ""There's much to think about in what the comrade has just said and what we've got to do is to connect this with all the other struggles now going on, the nurses, the miners, [insert any major strikers], the Greenham women, and those in the wider world, for jobs, disarmament, against apartheid … [continues for several minutes until weirdo is forgotten.]""

&gt; It is terrible but true to say that Benn was  'soft on Communism' at this time, never willingly attacking any Soviet policy, constantly explaining away Soviet military might, including its nuclear arsenal, as a defensive response to legitimate fears. Benn never attacked any transgression by any 'progressive' regime or institution. I attended a meeting in the early 1980s in which he reported on his recent visit to Castro's Cuba. He dwelt on Castro's pursuit of human rights through education and health but never mentioned the regime's abuses of gay people or the mentally ill or dissidents, including people trying to organise free trade unions.

I know Fulham fans that aren't very serious about supporting them and have no real rivalry with Chelsea fans but they still acknowledge there is. Same with Chelsea fans that are not too serious they are more concerned with the competitive rivalries. However, every serious fan i've ever met both Chelsea and Fulham will say they have a rivalry even if it isn't as serious as other rivalries. Also before you discredit a 21 year olds experience of meeting football fans I have been to the bridge many times and many more times drank in the pubs around it. I have watched football all over Britain in pubs and stadiums and as you can tell I speak about football a lot so I have spoke to fans from Inverness to Plymouth. I may not be as lucky (or as rich) as you or your Fulham/Chelsea buddies with season tickets but trust me I know football. 

I also disagree that: 

&gt;Rivalries have nothing to do with distance or how often you've played a team

Some rivalries are not based on distance or how often they play but a lot of them are. Celtic vs Rangers, United vs City, Arsenal vs Tottenham, Sunderland vs Newcastle etc. do you think these rivalries are based on something other than distance? The Celtic vs Rangers fixture is the most dangerous rivalry in the world but even that has died down noticeably because of Rangers having to work their way back up the Scottish leagues. That clearly has something to do with how often they play. 

There is no equation like: distance x amount played = Rivalry LOL

there is a lot of nonsense to the whole *""big""* club *""small""* club concept but a bit of truth to it too.



I make a comparison in US Sports although due to the draft and free agency sport is a lot more cyclical there.



*LA Lakers would be a big club - history, fans, championships, international recognition (Man Utd etc.)



*Minessota Timberwolves would be a small club - lack of history/new club, never even come close to championship contention, only have fans in  their home town/state, maybe better known as Hockey town etc. (Wigan Athletic - Wigan Rugby much more famous) 




Ofcourse fortunes go up and down but just rest easy that theres not many bigger than Tottenham Hotspur in England and even in Europe.

Now, just to be clear this ""bond"" that's a registered tenancy deposit scheme company right? That company has a duty to ensure all parties are reasonably happy.  
If she writes a letter to the tenancy deposit scheme company stating she agrees to the landlord's deductions and would like the money to be paid from the scheme back to the account it was originally paid from (which you said was her solo account). That's more than reasonable.  
The Landlord will not dispute that.  
The ex-BF will, but let him, the company will make some enquiries and most likely will end up ruling in her favour. The worst case scenario is it drags the whole process out. If he wants to go to court let him, watch a judge look over the evidence (hopefully she kept a record of all those rent payments, even the cash ones she should have got a receipt for.) and determine not only does ex-BF get any money, he has to pay all legal fees.  
  
Maybe explain to the mother that legal fees to argue the deposit would cost more than the deposit itself most likely. I'm assuming £100 - £400 in legal court costs, for just under £500?  
  
  
EDIT: Oh, on a legal technicality, the Bond should have actually been changed into just her name as it's a new tenancy, so technically that Bond isn't for the new tenancy, so it'd be hard to deduct anything from it. Sit down and talk with the landlord about it. Show the TDS the new tenancy and ask them if the Bond is basically invalid, they might even return the whole amount then. More likely you'd just get the £500 though.

There is no equation like: distance x amount played = Rivalry LOL so one example does not disprove what I am saying... I could give another 5 examples of teams with rivalries far from them!

That's exactly the point I am trying to make. It's more to do with how often teams play each other than distance. And we've played Fulham far less than other games such as Rangers v Celtic, Liverpool v Everton, Spurs v Arsenal etc.

Correct, in EU we have open borders.  The vast majority of EU immigrants are beneficial.  I would agree to some slight changes in EU law to restrict criminals with extensive records (but this is a straw-man argument, it's not a major issue.  Right wing papers would be all over this if an issue), and we already have limits on when you can claim benefits (yet again was a non-issue but makes some people feel better).  There will never be a limit on education or language skills within EU, so you may want to reconcile yourself to that.  But again, non issue given EU migrants are typically better educated.

Luckily we have a EU Ref coming, the sooner the better so we can finally get past this and move on.

I was very much in the same boat. Commuting on the bike gets very samey and boring after a while. It sucks for sure - nobody likes commuting, no matter the vehicle. Busy roads, loads of traffic means that taking the bike out and pushing it to see what you can get out of it is pretty much suicide in the rush hour. Even at weekends it gets tiresome when there is traffic about. You're limited to what you can do to keep yourself safe.

What did it for me was realising that riding wasn't so much about just getting from A to B, but it was *how* I got there. Sometimes it wasn't about where I was going at all, just the enjoyment I got out of pinning the throttle and watching the needle climb. For example, yesterday evening I rode home and thought ""Urgh, I hate riding home from work.."". It was hot, slow and drivers were being their classic knobbey selves. I had to put some tyre sealant in my front tyre and needed to give the bike a spin to get the Goop all spread out. I did this around 8pm - when the roads were nice and quiet and it was just beginning to get dark. 

Being able to crank the throttle and tear it around corners with no other traffic about was 100x more enjoyable than riding home 3 hours previous was. That pretty much summed it up for me - riding to/from work is a necessity. Riding outside of those hours is a joy; you're more awake, there is less traffic, conditions tend to be better. Everything is in your favor.

This is why I think so many riders have a commuter mule for the average 9-5 that is reliable, solid and cheap to run and a toy that they get out at weekends and in the evenings to rag around on. I'm very tempted to do this myself - if only I had a garage!

Riding at 7.30am when you wake up is crap because you're still half asleep. Riding at 5pm when you leave work is crap because you're probably shattered.

The 2nd half MLS team is just about on par with the first half team in terms of performance in MLS this season. The only difference is that the first half team except McCarty and Beltran have all played at the international level a lot so they are used to adjusting to playing with different players quickly and understand kind of the same style to play. (Yes David Villa's Spain teams played incredibly different from Zusi, Besler, etc. do/did with the US but international play is a different level than MLS that they're used to)

I'd say apart from Giovinco, Feilhaber, Finlay, Kamara, and Castillo have arguably been the best players in MLS this season. Castillo I think will be playing in Europe very soon, there's been light talk about Olympiacos. I think he has a pretty bright future ahead of him. 

Drew Moor is a CB who was playing out of position at RB and Cronin was basically in the team because he plays for the Colorado Rapids and so as a last minute replacement he was already in Denver. Not that Cronin isn't a good MLS player but that's basically why he was there. 

But overall I'd say the two teams that MLS put out were about equal despite the second half team lacking names with the defense of the first team being a bit stronger.

The cyclist is argumentative but I'll give him some leeway as he has just nearly been knocked off. I don't like his attitude but unfortunately a few cyclists have this problem; that said I feel we get defensive because often our lives are the ones put at risk.

I ride a lot myself, mainly for fun in the evening or weekends; unfortunately it's a risk we take every time we get on the road. More needs to be done to educate drivers about the dangers of the 2 tonne death machine they are controlling.

I honestly don't think people realise how little time they lose stuck behind a cyclist waiting for an appropriate passing point. Example: if a cyclist is travelling at 15 mph on a flat road and the legal limit is 30 mph; even if you are stuck behind the cyclist for a whole minute the loss of distance is 1/60th of 15 miles - and how often is it a full minute? If its 30 seconds the distance ""lost"" is halved and the time taken to make this distance up is minimal.

**Why he re-signed with Liverpool**

&gt;Honestly, in the end the decision was really simple,

&gt;There were other offers but I couldn’t leave one of the best clubs in the world.

&gt;For me, to be able to be at Liverpool – playing for this manager and being part of this squad and playing for amazing fans - is massive.

&gt;I really enjoy being here. I feel loved and that’s important. I am so lucky to be at a club like this and I want to help this club to get better.

**Regarding the tour of Asia &amp; Australia**

&gt;It was amazing on the tour and I really felt the love,

&gt;It’s very humbling when you get support like that.

&gt;In Adelaide it was very cold but the people were very warm.

&gt;We saw the love for the club all over the world and that shows you how big the club is. Everywhere we go they are behind us.

**His role &amp; the current situation of the squad**

&gt;I know I have a role to play in helping the younger players,

&gt;I have a lot of experience but I’m not here just for that.

&gt;I want to play football. And I’ll fight and give 100% every single day to show to the manager that I’m able to play. That’s what everyone has to do.

&gt;We have two or three players for every position now. If someone is not fit then we’ve got someone ready to come in and play. You need that competition.

null,false,Kalissss,eng-wiltshire,"Starring Jeremy Corbyn as Michael Foot ",null,"My Dad's CLP (Ilford North) had the highest contact rate between January 1st and the General Election, where the CLP and the brilliant Wes Streeting overturned a 5000 Tory majority to win the seat by 500. They nominated Liz Kendall last night, but JC got very few of the votes at the meeting. Wes had the highest contact rate out of any Labour candidate in the election, and was able to provide a personal message to what is a marginal middle class outer London seat, and a seat that must be held if Labour wants to govern again.

They are not voting for JC because after talking to ACTUAL VOTERS and members of the public, they came up with the conclusion that non-voters are not all ""disenfranchised socialists"", but some genuinely do not give a crap about politics at all and would be nigh on impossible to convince them to vote. Wes was instead able to win a large coalition of voters, from Tories to Lib Dems to vote Labour thanks to his incredible effort in presenting himself a professional sensible candidate who is pragmatic and not ideological. He also wants Labour to actually win an election under the FPTP system (which I oppose), which will require a huge swing to Labour.

Also, in terms of voters, a report by the Fabians shows that in Midland marginals 4/5 voters Labour will need to win these seats voted Tory. It was 1/5 this election thanks to the ideological Lib Dem collapse will go to Labour (not true, my Uncle voted Lab 97 and 01, LD 05 and 10, and Tory this time) which obviously did not happen. Therefore, while non-voter convincing is useful, we must remember that a harder left Labour could turn many ""moderates"" off to a party like the Lib Dems or even the Tories! Remember, 1/3 of Labour's 6% loss of support went to the Tories according to electoral calculus. Any strategy which relies on non-voters turning up is an utter joke of one. 

Furthermore, only 24 Tories sit in seats with less than a 3000 majority, and of the 90+ seats Labour needs to win a majority, less than 30 have Labour + LD + Grn &gt; Tory vote. Under the current FPTP system, JC simply cannot win a majority. There were harder left options on offer at the GE, but as I just said, not enough harder lefts returning to Labour without moderates leaving to win. I'm not a LK fan and I think Blairism won't work, but right now I'm supporting Andy Burnham as someone who can keep the party united, has actually got the highest public approval rating (YouGov) of all the candidates, and if we're still behind in the polls will hopefully step down for Jarvis in 2018.

My suggestion would be to *heavily* tax people based on obesity and deny them treatment for obesity related illnesses until they lost weight and were healthy again. Somewhere in the region of an extra 10% flat rate tax on all income would motivate almost all fat people to lose weight, the country would get more money, the NHS wouldn't have to spend so much on preventable issues and the country would be healthier and less unsightly.

I can understand that you want to get this over and done with, but to be honest it's probably better for you to make sure that you get the right outcome. Like rushing an essay, and only getting a C when you know that you deserve and can't get an A. 
Honest to God it sounds like you are being taken for a ride here with the predicted cost of new insurance. With announcing a claim I think you have to declare it for a few years. My fiance has a speeding conviction that he still has to announce 5 years after he got it, even though the conviction itself comes off your licence after 3. I have to let me insurers know that my bike was stolen even though I never made a claim and it was recovered. Unfortunately insurance is the biggest legal scam going and you get in trouble for not taking part.. 

Don't know if any of the above helped, but keep the questions going, there are some very nice and knowledgeable people on here :)

hazard (24), Oscar (23), Matic (26), Dave (25), Zouma (20) for the future, Willian (26), I feel like Fabregas is there but with even more experience he'll do better for us his deep playmaker role wont really be affected too much as he grows older. Costa is 26 but injury prone so theres a problem. Courtois is only 23 and already a top 3 goalkeeper in the world. Then look at the youth players who could/should come through RLC, Van Ginkel etc.

they'll get better and the team will grow in chemsitry which will give us an advantage over these newly made teams we'll face. It wouldn't be ridiculous to expect internal growth given the age of a lot of our first team players.  I mean Oscar at 23 is a perfect example if he becomes how good we want him to be we have a WC no10 for about 6 years. Although other teams have strengthened we have stability where they do not, look at United they are losing Di Maria already and he was shit last year. Schweinsteiger is also injured, De Gea will leave for free next year. I honestly think people are under rating the stability that we have. City will lose a number of players and have to massively rebuild (lucky FFP has been relaxed) and for every player Arsenal buys that will start their team changing and having to adapt just like United did last year and if things go badly United will have to ""rebuild"" this season as well, as if they havent started already. Arsenal has tried using young players for years in the hope that they will some day pay off and have chemsitry as a result but have failed year after year, we're lucky that we have players who are world class or near it already at such a young age. Hazard, Oscar and Willian are already settled they've been together for years. With Stones and Zouma at the back possibly we'll be set for a decade and Zouma is already nearly ready to start. Arsenal are in for big name players and when they spend massively it will have the same impact as it did on United, they'll need to adapt and theres no guarantee it will pay off as well and their team will gel. I know this thread is made because hes worried about the immediate but even then our team is as good as all of the new ones despite their changes and we have a team that is comfortable together none of the others do aside from City and that will change very soon",null,0,null,1438346229,null,0,1438346843,0,ctmpcr4,null,t3_3fa5er,null,t1_ctmpcr4,null,t1_ctmp1hd,null,null,null,1440198444,null,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2,null

I would be happy for them to be in a box, but it doesn't change anything.

I can collect from most locations between Exeter and Paington


Type|Item|Paying

**CPU** | Pentium G3258 | £40
**Mobo** | MSI H81M-P33 V2 | £25

**Storage** | 1TB HDD | £30
**PSU** | EVGA 500W 80+ bronze | £30
**Any dvd reader/writer** | | £5
**Powerline adapter** | | £25

I would buy the case on my own, as it would feel better with a new case. Also, I already have a monitor and a TV that are both 19', so I can use two displays.

**EDIT**: It would help alot if I could see that the parts are working fine.

&gt; Lots of Drake fans were doing the equivalent of school kids going ""oooooh"" to encourage a fight awaiting Drake's response. The memes and jokes suggested Meek had set his sights to high given Drakes higher profile as a famous rapper. Drake posted a picture showing him wearing a 'free meek mill' t shirt when mm was in prison as if to say wheres the loyalty and friendship?
&gt; Drake has since released two songs addressing Meek Mill.

&gt; Drake fans on twitter and bpt are acting like they've sealed the deal and ended the affair, making new jokes and memes about mms inability to come back from this. Others are eagerly awaiting mm response to drag this all out.

This account is only 10 days old but I have arranged this post with the mods after proving the age of my main account.

I'm hoping to sell all this stuff in one go. I'm guessing it'd come up to about £1,000 (around 63% original sale value).
All this stuff was bought and assembled in February (aside from the Asus wifi card, which I got because the mobo's onboard wifi wasn't up to the job).
The CPU has been moderately overclocked but not used for anything very intense - same deal with the graphics card.

[Firestrike score](https://i.imgur.com/gxg8NTA.png) (no manual overclocking aside from MSI's stock clock)

Other freebies packaged at no cost to you:

Arctic silver 5 thermal paste

Stock i5 cooler, replaced by the Noctua one

A mostly full can of air

Antistatic band

A tin of  alcohol for thermal paste replacement (not to drink!)

I would prefer the buyer to collect from near me (Maidenhead, Berkshire) but I can drive out a short distance if this would be helpful. However, I would remove the CPU cooler, as Noctua recommend against having it on during transportation owing to the weight.

All packaging and warranty info for the parts included. None of the warranty schemes have been registered.

&gt;'Why are you selling all this? I smell a rat'

I've decided to go cold turkey on video games. I have a self control problem so I want to get rid of the problem and use the money for a different hobby. It's a cracking setup.

Note: [there is some very minor damage to the bottom of the case](https://imgur.com/a/26sc3#11). AFAIK it makes no difference in terms of performance and is completely invisible except when a case fan is removed. However you may want to bear it in mind if you want to resell it.

I agree with /u/czechm8e; have 2 accounts. One that you pay into and another for general day to day usage. Interest is low so there isn't really much point in investing. It's better in my opinion to have a bit of a safety net. It also means that if you are going out, you can limit what you spend by just taking a card with £20 out and £10 cash (or less - depends what you spend). (budget a lot for the freshers week - it won't be cheap including societies etc. I think I spent around £300 over the 2 welcome weeks) I would advise you to shop around in Plymouth and online at the banks for the account that suits you the best - all student accounts will have 0% interest while you are at uni and usually for a year after you have finished so find the deal that best suits you. Different banks will have different perks that come with the account - I used Santander and got free mobile and gadget insurance which I actually had to use.

Plymouth is a great uni; I'm graduating from there this September and had a great time. If you want to ask anything about it feel free to pm me. Bit of advice unrelated to pf - join a couple of societies / sports clubs - there are some great ones. Also: find a balance between work and play. It's fine to have fun, but don't throw away that £40,000 you will be plowing into your education - make sure to dedicate time to studies. Keep in mind if you fail a module you will have to retake and possibly redo the year. Make friends with people on your course and help each other with your work and work together. If you have problems go speak to your lecturers even if you don't like them - they will try and accommodate you were possible and are usually pretty good. If you are having difficulty with maths go and see the people at SUM:UP (in the library) and they will do their best to help you.

Plymouth will cap you at 40% if you submit late unless you have a valid reason and they are incredibly strict on it - more so than some red brick universities.

With Valencia injured I'd say we need to bring in 2 strikers, ideally Austin as one of them, hefty price tag but I think he's probably the best option we can get and I imagine he'd hit the ground running for us. In addition then you'd look at another wildcards similar to Sakho, maybe even take a punt on someone from the championship. We also could do with a rb, and a couple wingers in my opinion. 

Bakary Sako, who I think is now a free agent, could be interesting, can play down the wing and I reckon could do a job when our squad is stretched. 

Matt Philips is another option for a winger, relegated with QPR, could offer Jarvis as part of the deal. 

Obviously there have been links with Bolasie, again depending on price wouldn't be a terrible buy. 

Elmohamady wouldn't be a bad coup from a relegated Hull, good attacking right back to cover for Jenks. 

I'm struggling the think of other strikers worth taking a risk on, could look to steal a Deeney/Wilson from one of the promoted clubs but I doubt they'll be up to scratch, would be better seeing how they fair in the prem and looking in January.

I appreciate that 34% didn't come out and vote, but talking to people I'm surprised it's not actually higher, regardless of who's on the ballot paper; a lot people simply don't care about politics. It's worth noting that turnout in 1945 was only 72.8%. It's also a myth, I think, that those who don't vote are broadly left-wing, as well; in 1992 John Major won the Tories the most votes in British history with almost 78%.

*I would also mention appealing to LDs and Greens, but the former's 8% can only grow at this point. No way can they fall further, and plus they are actually helpful in places (e.g. the West Country) where the Labour Party has little support. With regards to the Greens, they represented 4% of the vote and we can't endlessly chase this stubborn number without the risk of alienating most of the rest of the electorate.

Also, Okore will be out until September so he won't be an option and Richards won't be a RB. Sanchez didn't have a great year, but played brilliantly in the Copa, however Westy has had a fantastic preseason; for me, that spot is up for grabs. I thought Bacuna just didn't do enough in preseason to earn a spot over Gil at RM. Not quite sure if Gueye will challenge for the CAM or CDM spot, could do well at either I think with his athletic ability. I'd like to see Jack start, but Veretout seems a talent so we will see. If Veretout gets the nod at CAM, I hope Tim starts Grealish wide instead of Sinclair, but Sinclair finished preseason strong, so I think he will likely start. Kozak just put away a brace, unless Gestede signs and performs extremely well in training I think the big man will be Libor. However, if Ade signs as well the trio would have an interesting battle for the start. Unfortunately.....I think Gabby will start as a ST as well. Though, I'd personally like to see Ayew there instead to see what he offers. Overall, our team has significantly better depth this season than in the past few. There are many interchangeable lineups and options which should (hopefully) lead to a higher finish in the table. I'd like to see us push for top 14 modestly, and top 12 if we're reaching:

Here's what  the office of National Statistics has to say about the latest figures:

&gt; Comparing March to May 2015 with the 3 months to February 2015, the number of people in employment fell by 67,000 (to reach 30.98 million), the number of unemployed people increased by 15,000 (to reach 1.85 million) and the number of people not in the labour force (economically inactive) aged from 16 to 64 increased by 30,000 (to reach 9.02 million).

It's interesting to note that whilst the statistics show an annual rise in employment, and a fall in unemployment, they also show a strong rise in the number of people not in work.

Begovic is a downgrade on Cech (albeit the best available upgrade).



Cuadrado is worse than Schurrle.



Falcao is out of form and cannot command the dressing room like Drogba.



Felipe Luis to someone who is not as good as him thats for sure (especially at this current moment).





We have lost 2 massive characters from our dressing room than had won it all (Drogba and Cech)




Our opponents now know us, and will prepare differently since it is exactly the same team




Our rivals have strengthened in first team places whereas we have been stagnant.




We have done nothing, NOTHING to address the way we played against big teams last year, there is something in our squad that is stopping Mourinho from telling our team to play like the team we should be, and we havent addressed it.




Statistics show that there is a reason no team has retained the title since 2009. Teams are spending awfully after winning the league, too be fair, we do have the advantage that our team is so much younger than those other title winning teams, especially 2010, 2013 &amp; 2014 squads.



It comes to something when even if we sign Stones and Rahman, the only real upgrade we have had is Moses over Salah from the start of last season. What I have stated is purely factual. 


We are now relying on this phantom ""growth"" of players and chemistry etc. Considering the lack of signings we better hope Oscar actually does maintain form due to the full summer break he had, aswell as Cuadrado showing something to justify the £23m we spent on him.

&gt; I am probably commenting too late to be seen but I feel it must be said as the uniformity of contempt for the Obese (and let us not forget drug addicts and alcoholics) disgusts me to my core.

&gt; Firstly you are not 'paying' to support these people's lifestyles, nor are you 'funding' their bad habits. In Britain we pay taxes, those taxes have for the last sixty years built a welfare system that is the most cost effective and best in the world. Until recently. The savage cuts to the state, and their inevitable sale to the market has devastated lives and brought some of the weakest and worst off in our society to their knees. In their place Cameron and his neo-liberal ilk want us to erect a big society in its place, to plug the gaps that we 'can no longer afford'. The big society is the Victorian philanthropist model by another name, that those at the very top much see the error of their ways (rare) pay part of their income to support those who work for them and their families to support them (rarer) and to devote their fortune to helping others (almost never happened). Instead they built at most token gestures, at worst work houses which say their are helping but merely exploit the poor and downtrodden who have nothing.

&gt; Secondly let us not forget that obesity, drugs and alcohol are not isolated. Often they are caused by mental illness, or unhappiness in their life. Try living on welfare. It isn't fun. It isn't easy. The constant tests and trials and appointments and increasing requirements and suspicion and eventually programs such as 'workfare'[1] which force you to work a job, for free, in order to claim benefits, that were established because we believed that having food, shelter, power, heating and some to keep yourself happy was a human right. Not to mention the deep and draconian cuts to mental health treatment which my family who work within it have witnessed first hand. Nor to mention that most people on benefits are either retired or in work and that these benefits are there to support the chronically low wages that have been falling in real terms for at least a decade. So you have no money, little job prospects, if you get a job you get less that you are worth, and yet you are demonized and treated as if you are worth less for your vices, of which we all have, especially those in power, and yet still you want to take away what little they have left?

&gt; All of this for the priority of profit, a concept that has no place in the finances of a country and should be viewed as immoral and certainly not celebrated. Britain has the sixth largest economy in the world, we are able to spend trillions propping up the banks and supporting large corporations. Yet now we cannot afford the welfare state the levellers, the WWII returning soldiers and my grandparents generation fought and died for? We could afford it for two generations! We could afford it during the cold war! But now, now the crony capitalist say we can't? Those who stand to benefit. Those who have stolen away trillions, bribed our politicians, formed natural monopolies and themselves benefited from the welfare state say that now, NOW we cannot afford to treat everyone as human beings!?

&gt; I am appalled by their lies. I am sickened that 'Well I am doing alright' propaganda is so effective on everyone here. Disgusted the ultra orthodox ideologues will carve up welfare and with it the country I love for their selfish greed. But mostly angry. That my generation feels we can do nothing, have nothing, and should keep our heads down and look after ourselves. One day we will see our mistakes, I just hope it will not be too late. If it isn't too late then those corrupt people of power should be fearful in their beds. Because I don't see them being able to worm their way out of the building anger they created. I really hope that when it comes it will be through trials and sentences rather than mobs and bloodshed.

Just because Markovic and Ibe have good potential doesn't mean they will both become world class. Same for Adama. But the probability of 1 out of 3 making it is much higher than 1 out of 2.

Here's a scenario from about 13 years ago. We had the then highly rated winger Ritchie Partridge on the verge of the first team. If you can't remember, back then the hype about Partridge was real. Not as much as Ibe now, but maybe Ibe at the start of last season. We had Vladimir Smicer, Danny Murphy and Patrik Berger ahead of him in the first team.

We were interested in a fairly unknown 17 year old Cristiano Ronaldo but were put off by his 5-10m asking price and put our faith in Richie Partridge instead. Man Utd bought him the next season for 12m.

So, if we can get Adama now, lets do it. If it means one of Markovic, Ibe or Adama himself goes on loan, then whats the problem.

If Barcelona but in a buy back clause the worst case scenario is that we make a tidy profit. There is literally no downside to this deal, if it happens.

This is correct. As long as you pay the full statement balance by the payment due date (full payment by direct debit suggested) you will not be charged interest on *any* credit card.  Since you will not be charged interest it does literally does not matter what the interest rate on the card is. The exception to this is for cash withdrawals (always ill-advised) which begin to accrue interest from the day they take place.

Just to clarify - the only people who pay interest on credit cards is those who either withdraw cash or don't pay their statement in full.

If you can try to get a card with rewards or decent introductory offer, unfortunately these are the hardest to get. Failing getting one of those just get one with a decent interest rate (*just in case* you ever do need to carry a balance). Failing being able to qualify for one of those try to get a credit builder type credit card (horrid interest rates but if paying in full doesn't matter). If you can't get one of those you have some serious issues somewhere.

I have a feeling this season will either go very well or seem very mediocre in comparison with last season. We've got a lot more depth to our squad than last year, so hopefully we can avoid those spells we had where an injury or suspension on a player left us with no options for key positions. Specific examples from last season were when we lost Taylor to 10 yellows suspension, or when Gomis and Oliveira were both injured for a couple of games.

**Which player is going to be your star of the season and why?**

This is really a tough question due to the way that our line ups can really affect how certain players perform. If we go back to using the 4-2-3-1, it could be Sigurdsson or Shelvey. With the Diamond, Gomis really shine. Montero could becoming devastating if he stays healthy. Then there's always Ash and Fabianski in the back to account for.


**How do you think the team will line up?**

4-2-3-1: Fabianski, Naughton, Fernandez, Williams, Taylor, Cork, Shelvey, Routledge, Sigurdsson, Montero, Gomis.

That really sums up where the club is at now. Drogba and Cech were leaders in the locker room, no doubt, but we've begun something new with new superstars and new leaders (although Terry will probably stay forever).

We have the best striker, winger, CM, DM, back 4, and GK in the league, and I don't think any of the moves by other clubs has changed that. We have chemistry and young players who are going to continue to get even better. There's no reason to think that growth is ""phantom,"" it is real.

Falcao is already playing better than last season, and should provide a significant upgrade on the field over Drogba. Felipe was an obvious loss, but by bringing in a younger player like Baba (hopefully), we're setting ourselves up to continue to be successful in the future. A Stones signing would be similar. The perks of winning trophies and having a stacked starting XI is that you can bring in and develop younger players, because there is no significant place of *need* in our first team.

and incidentally, i am not defending the driver, i am stating that the cyclist was out looking for a fight and thats what he got

why is it unreasonable to expect the cyclists to pull over and let the driver past?

here in rural ireland it is common to encounter slower traffic on the roads - mainly tractors. instead of staying in the middle of the road, the farmers will generally move over a bit when they have the chance to allow quicker traffic to pass. its an example of road users COOPERATING with other users - the cyclist had opportunities to do  exactly that. he should have done so in the interests of sharing the road with all users and also in the interests of his own personal safety - the  biggest concern should be the potentially unpredictable actions of others

unfortunately, and often because of incidents like this, many cyclists have adopted an aggressive attitude towards other road users while often at the same time completely ignoring the laws of the road themselves

i personally have seen 5 (YES FIVE) people hit by cyclists on a single pedestrian crossing in rusholme, manchester where the cyclists had just completely ignored the red traffic light

i also witnessed the death of a council worker whose 'cherry picker' was hit by a bus that had swerved to avoid a cyclist

we SHARE the roads and that means we have to approach our usage in the spirit of COOPERATION

I'm going to say in the nicest possible way - you don't know what you're talking about. We were targeted. Threats were made. By the UVF as well, but definitely by the RA.

Watching your sister like a hawk, being taught where the gun is and how to use it if anyone comes in and gets my parents before they get them. Real fucking fun childhood. 

I personally don't care about what people say about what group. The state, the republicans and the loyalists ruined my childhood.

Worst case scenario - do cases like this always end in a 50/50 split of the property's value, or will factors like his abandonment of the mortgage, inability to pay back loans secured against the property (to buy his new woman jewelry(!)) which were eventually paid off by my gf's mother, etc., be taken into account?

On top of this, new reforms mean defendants can be tried by a single lay magistrate (rather than a bench of 3), and they don't have to go into court - it can all be done from the police station.

Of course, there are still problems with defendants having to wait weeks or months between being arrested and charged, and then charged and actually put on trial (when defendants may be unable to work, but have to pay for their lawyers if they can afford them), but that's the price we have to pay for justice.

So, what you're saying is? It's easy for whites when it comes to Extremist muslims? I disagree. Also religion isn't a colour, I've seen Black, Asian, Indian, Thai and WHITE muslims. 

Galloway has actually battled for gay rights too but i do agree he is of dodgy character, that's why I prefaced by saying whether he 
actually believes what he says is debatable. He is always on ""the other side"" on most issues.

null,false,IxionS3,null,null,null,"I'm going to assume English law applies - Scottish law is very different when it comes to inheritance.

AFAIK there are 2 basic possibilities for a disinherited child.

Option is to try and get the will ruled invalid.  This would require them to either show that the correct formal legal process was not complied with (e.g. around the signing and witnessing of the will) or that the testator (i.e. your grandmother) was not of sound mind or was somehow unduly influenced or under duress when the will was made.  From what you've said this doesn't seem likely.

Option 2 is a claim under the [Inheritance \(Provision for Family and Dependants\) Act 1975](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1975/63) This allows certain people (including the spouse of the deceased, their child or anyone that the deceased was maintaining in whole or part immediately prior to the death) to ask a court to determine that the will does not make ""reasonable financial provision"" for them and make an order to modify the will to correct this.

It's fairly difficult for a non-dependent adult to succeed with such a claim but it's not impossible, as evidenced [just a few days ago](http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/28/daughter-wins-164000-decade-long-legal-battle-mother-will-charities) where an estranged adult daughter was awarded £164,000 from her mother's estate.

Good. Remember, a criminal conviction cannot be handed down in court unless it is **beyond reasonable doubt**. (And per Rawls, the measure of a judicial system is *not* how it prosecutes criminals, but how it deals with the innocent.)

What these fines are *really* about is browbeating poor people into knuckling under and accepting on-the-spot fines from police officers, rather than trying to get justice through the courts when the magistrate sees through a paper-thin tissue of a case. It turns a day in court into a threat of poverty rather than an opportunity for justice.

Worse: if allowed to persist, these fines will encourage police services to pursue an institutional policy of bringing highly dubious prosecutions, simply because they're likely to obtain a conviction from someone who is too poor to go to court. It'll improve their performance metrics (arrests leading to successful convictions). So we could well end up with police services who focus on random prosecutions of poor people (regardless of supporting evidence) in order to jack up their stats or raise money.",null,0,null,1438354006,null,0,1438354245,0,ctmtkcd,null,t3_3f9oya,null,t1_ctmtkcd,null,t1_ctmqgga,null,null,null,1440200493,null,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

null,false,Boonsquemador,null,null,null,"&gt; The point I'd argue with is that we immediately gelled last season then teams ""sussed"" us out and we struggled (especially against the big teams).

 agreed. Ever since that draw against Sunderland we didnt look as dominating. our play was too systematic and side to side and we werent direct enough. teams just parked the bus and managed to stop us winning all the time. Remember we lost to Newcastle the very next week. Luckily the team managed to change (enough) during the second half of the season for us to win, but we struggled to kill games thats what lost us wins and has done so in preseason where we've greated about 5+ goal scoring chances in each game but not finished them, we can blame the constant awful refereeing against us week in week out but they were still games we should have won by finishing the chances we did have. I disagree about us not being able to ""blow away"" the top teams, we are still capable of doing it but Mourinho never goes all out. Look at matches like Man City and United away where we completely blew games that we should have won. The reason we havent had many blowout games is because our finishing for the 2nd half of the season was poor in my opinion. We create enough chances every game to score at least 3 goals. Also do you remember last season whenever we went up the team we played whether its Hull or Southampton or Stoke etc immediately looked like scoring, its complacency the team starts passing it around and walking in our half like its nothing instead of being hungry to win the ball back and score more. In the first half of the season the team properly pressed all the time when we lost the ball and we'd win it back quickly after, in the second half that changed big time because they were comfortable with sitting back and thinking others teams couldnt score against us",null,0,null,1438354163,null,0,1438354552,0,ctmto00,null,t3_3facwx,null,t1_ctmto00,null,t1_ctmsbg7,null,null,null,1440200541,null,0,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,0,null

Thank you for your response, I should have said that yes it is English Law.

The will was created at a solicitors (where one copy has been kept). She was of sound mind until her death (She was adamant on going home where she lived alone after being discharged rather than a care home, and the hospital had to comply with that).

No one was dependant on her, each of her sons own their own businesses/are successful in their own right. If I'm very honest it really has nothing to do with if 'they need the money'. I believe it will be contested to spite the person who has been left x amount of money. My grandmother was very certain on what she wanted, and has said that 'this will cause problems' before her passing (although what those problems were we didn't know at the time). 

I did follow the story about the lady who was awarded money, that is one of the reason's I posted. There was some mention that if people were not included there would have to be a reason why they weren't, which I don't believe there was. I assume however this only applies if one of the two ways they could contest (which no apply imo) is proven.

I have to say that owning a weapon is not aggressive, owning a weapon and using it to act with malice is.

There are no **inherent** personal freedoms as legislation changes and unfortunately does this quite often to its detriment. However my political philosophy dictates what these are to me and should be to society.

2. I'm inclined to give Cuadrado a little more time before raising my pitchfork, thank you very much. He's gotten bugger all minutes since he's arrived. I;m not saying he's great or that he's doomed just that I think he should have a chance.

3. Sure, he can't command a dressing room like Drogba, but we have other players who have filled in the command positions. Drogba, Lampard and Cech were more or less easily replaceable. Particularly after a championship win like last season where other players had the chance to grow into those positions ON THE FIELD. Matic, Ivanovic, Fabregas, Hazard all show signs of being great leaders.

4. Felipe was barely used last season - and if we get someone who is younger and will grow into the left back slot then it is a much better decision than just keeping Felipe for the fuck of it.

5. Well, I'd counter that with having Courtois and Costa. Cech wasn't this amazing godlike commanding personality in his first season at Chelsea. I;d eve go so far as to say that we're in a better position now than we were when Mpourinho was building that old team. We didn't crumble when we lost Desailly, Zola and Wise. We replaced them. If Mourinho thinks he's done a good enough job of replacing players, then I trust him that much. He's bloody well earned it.

6. They knew us last season as well. In this day and age to use the ""our opponents know us"" is, frankly, obscenely outdated. We're not livng in the middle ages.

7. Our opponents have spent heavily -&gt; well they had to. We didn't. 

8. The way we play against big teams will never change while Mourinho is in charge of the team. No matter how many awesome players we have. If you disagree with that, then simply start a #MourinhoOut campaign.

9. I'll answer with two quotes. ""The devil is in the details"" and ""There are lies, damn lies and statistics"". Moneyball is based on stats only - and it's not exactly the best way to get players, now is it? So why should statistics alone be the guiding light in transfer policy?

--

Your ""stating facts"" statement is quite silly since facts in and of themselves mean nothing. Mourinho has all your ""facts"" and has come to his own conclusions. I happen to agree with him, you don't. Oh well. 

Also, I find the whole ""phantom ""growth"" of players"" a tad shortsighted, since it's that growth that clubs rely on to blood newer/younger players into the team. We just happen to be very lucky in that we can expect growth from someone like Oscar instead of relying on the growth of RLC or Chalobah.

RE: Kenedy. I've read we paid around 10 million for him, which should grant him a work permit without many problems since above that number they are given out quite easily. It was a bone of contention when the rules first came out.

All in all, I'm positive and still have things to look forward to this season. I think we'll win the league again and with the ""phantom"" growth that comes about this season we will be a step closer to winning the Champions League. Just like how it took our best players years of ""phantom growth"" to be able to win the Champions League in the first place.",null,0,null,1438354881,null,0,false,0,ctmu4y3,null,t3_3facwx,null,t1_ctmu4y3,null,t1_ctmr3gt,null,null,null,1440200763,null,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2,null

Labour now has to learn from this and become genuinely different from the Conservatives, leave Blair's New Labour behind and become something relevant in the 21st century.

Economic factors mean an increasing number of people cycle, often out of necessity rather than wanting to do it.

I'm from San Diego, California and am therefore a Chargers (NFL) and Padres (Baseball) fan since birth. Picked up Spurs when I was ~14. A lot of drama this offseason regarding the Chargers leaving San Diego to move to Los Angeles, our bitter rivals in everything, for essentially a new stadium and money.

Whenever I think of this, I get heartbroken to think that a team would do that to a whole city. My point in the conversation was that I would not only abandon the team I've spent 27 years cheering for, but abandon the NFL as a whole because it's an organization that doesn't hold the same beliefs I hold regarding what a team that bears the name of a city is. 

The San Diego Chargers have been in San Diego since the birth of the NFL (they played one year in Los Angeles during the AFL days in 1960 waiting for a stadium to be built). 55 years in one place. My brain just doesn't fathom the fact that the ownership/management doesn't see this team as San Diego's team but rather as ""the Chargers"". 

What are we? A team from fucking Woolwich who'll move for financial reasons and a stadium and drop the name of the city they've represented from the start?

They'll make risky moves where the risk isn't theirs to take, and if it goes wrong the price will be paid by the person on the bike, not the one in the multi-tonne metal safety cage. As a cyclist you never know which of the cars around you is being piloted by a total moron who'd happily risk killing you to shave 30 seconds off their journey.

...And on the other end of the scale are cyclists acting like pedestrians with road access... once you're on the road, you're a vehicle and all the same rules should apply to you, but there are the odd idiots who'll run red lights, unnecessarily take up an entire lane and prevent people from passing them, or just generally behave in a way that suggests they have zero sense of self-preservation and are thinking ""I'm on a *bike*, if anyone in a car hits me it's clearly their fault"".

You can encounter hundreds of sensible drivers or cyclists and it won't register, but every so often you see one idiot driver who makes you think ""that guy could have fucking killed me"" or one idiot cyclist who makes you think ""I could have fucking killed that guy"" and your opinion is jaded forever.",null,0,null,1438356269,null,0,false,0,ctmv2k8,null,t3_3f9v3v,null,t1_ctmv2k8,null,t1_ctms9vb,null,null,null,1440201202,null,86,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,86,null

I think I'm more Anti Tory than Pro Labour.

I just think Corbyn is real opposition and that isn't going to go down well with basically the rich and the Right sided media. 

Ed took Tony Blairs Playbook which Cameron also knows very well (the Heir to Blair) and lost, 
Corbyn is basically an unknown quantity on a front bench level and that might scare The scripted Tories as off the cuff questions are tough. 

I see Corbyn as a lefty Farage in some ways. 

The political Future could well be a well spoken intelligent righty in Farage, a well spoken intelligent Lefty in Corbyn and Dave in the middle somewhere lying to everyone. 

I voted Labour last GE and I had no real confidence in Ed, just best of a bad bunch. Corbyn has given people some hope, Apathy is slowly washing away, people are talking about Labour again and like I said Momentum is a funny thing, look at Scotland and their Anti Austerity movement.

That helps.  AIUI the first step in mounting a successful claim under the 1975 Act is persuading the court that the current situation is unreasonable with respect to the claimant.  If there is clear evidence of why the will was written the way it was and the court is persuaded that that was reasonable in the circumstances then the claim falls at the first hurdle (AIUI in the recent case there was a clear explanation in the form of letters from the deceased, but the court found that these were factually inaccurate and they therefore contributed to the court taking the view the will was not reasonable).

&gt; I assume however this only applies if one of the two ways they could contest (which no apply imo) is proven.

That said, if you have the means, why not learn to drive a car?  A fast car is an easier thing to extract performance from than a fast bike in the hands of a beginner, but there is a large degree of skill involved in doing either well.

If you want something exciting, try driving a proper car like a Caterham.  I was fortunate enough to run a borrowed Stage 2 GTR for a week last year and TBH it was a bit bland beyond the straight line grunt.  A RWD Caterham without an electronic safety net is far more exciting!

That the IRA and the British have done the same things but only one is called a terrorist, which isn't fair. But I would never say I agree with the killing of civilians or what you had to go through, I just want people to look at things fairly and this whole 'he's just a kid' thing is just trying to demean what I'm saying because you don't want to look at things fairly. 

I have a fair few things to say about what the RUC inflicted on innocent people for a *long* time but I won't say it out of consideration for what you went through.

Tax subsidy[edit]

Government can create the same outcome through selective tax breaks as through cash payment.[3] For example, suppose a government sends monetary assistance that reimburses 15% of all health expenditures to a group that is paying 15% income tax. Exactly the same subsidy is achieved by giving a health tax deduction. Tax subsidies are also known as tax expenditures. Tax subsidies are one of the main explanations for why the American tax code is so complicated.[6]

Tax breaks are a very common form of subsidy. Like other subsidies, they distort the economy; but tax breaks are also less transparent, and are difficult to undo.[7]

You said you would re-commit all POWs back to finish their sentences because of a crime's a crime idea. I then asked by that logic would you arrest British army soldiers who did the *exact same thing*? You didn't respond to the point but avoided it by accusing me of derailing the discussion when the point is completely relevant. 


You then introduce the criteria of 'every convicted murderer'. The British army question remains unanswered but we're moving on. Now you're talking about people who were already in jail should go back. By that logic then, should Gerry Adams be proven to have given the order to kill Jean McConville he wouldn't go to jail, he wasn't a convicted murderer. And if you *did* send him to jail, why wouldn't you send all the British army murderers to jail as well?

Crazily, no one was found guilty of any offence.

null,false,warp_spaz,,Belfast,null,"I haven't labelled anyone a war hero. That's a straw man you're constructing or a generalisation I have nothing to do with. My parents didn't go out to work to kill and maim and bomb though. However there were soldiers, police officers and the like who did some good and were commended for it. 

The problem is the paramilitary groups are just that. Their awards and medals don't mean as much because they are not legitimised by the international community. 

The PIRA as a whole was a terrorist organisation. The state committed terrorist atrocities too but it has the benefit of being a state. If it was the Irish Army vs the British  Army no one would have been called a terrorist. I have probably just as many gripes against the British and Irish state, the army and the RUC/Guards during the troubles as you do. The British government essentially left people like my parents out to dry, while getting into bed with terrorists for a political solution. Which was only necessary because of the British state's earlier actions.

It's well known to me what crimes were committed by people in the police, the UDR, etc. They should have been jailed too. Collusion did occur. It did occur more on the Loyalist/Army side, but collusion between loyalists and republicans and republicans and the British occured too. I have no problem with you using examples. I'll probably agree with you - unless you're talking about Loughgall or the like.  

It was a dirty fucking conflict and I pretty much condemn all sides and take only the side of the victims and those who have not done anything wrong. 

There were hundreds of normal men and women who joined the police, army, prison service because it was a job and because men and women were taking to the streets and targetting civilians and security services. They are not the same as MI5, Special Branch, etc. 

But they followed rules the paramilitaries did not. And suffered for it. We weren't civilians. We were targeted because we were associated with ""the enemy"". That's like me saying it's okay to put a bullet in one of Martin McGuinness's kids just because of who their father is. Or Niall O'donnghaile because of who his da is or was.

Ake is not as good as Luis was. Do you disagree with me on this point? Surely by definition if our replacement players, regardless of age, are not as good as our outgoing players we have got weaker, if even temporarily?

Our depth is pretty poor compared to the other top teams - I doubt we could cope if two (or even worse, three) of our defenders were injured for a long duration, or Hazard broke his leg. 

I'm the first to stand against the 'Galactico' fans who want all our players that haven't made an immediate impact sold and Reus/Griezmann/Pogba etc bought, but if our rivals have improved, even if we haven't gotten any worse it's not like our squad has gotten much better this transfer window. We still lack a creative CM in case Fabregas gets injured. We have two fullbacks for two positions, and as keen as I am for the likes of Ake to get a chance I'm not comfortable relying on him to do as good a job as Azpilicueta does week in, week out in the case of an injury. I don't feel Ake is ready to start against PSG in the Champion's League Quarter Finals followed by a title rival, away, three days later.

Chelsea **are** going to sign new players - Stones is a great example. It's not simply to placate me, it's what football teams do. If we want to be the best we can't rest on our laurels and say 'we walked it last time, we'll do so again'. We have to constantly improve. After we won the title in '10, we bought the following players:

Yossi Benayoun, Kalas, Ramires and Delac.

Those four young potentials weren't enough, and over the winter we spent another ~£70 million on Torres and David Luiz, and we still didn't retain the title. Begovic was a replacement for Cech, and was a great buy. We currently have four strikers in Kenedy, Falcao, Remy and Costa so I'd guess Kenedy will go on loan for a season.

We still have areas we can improve, and we still lack depth. I don't want us to go and spend £20 million on a 30-year-old, I enjoy us being able to make a profit.

null,false,Torchedkiwi,Glyndwr,Glyndwr,null,"Rule Number One: Remember that you're in Wales, and not England. Pretty much everyone will forgive you because you're not from the UK, but it makes people happy to be recognised as separate.
Llandovery is quite removed from the large population areas, if you're from a large-ish American town or city it'll basically seem like a large village. If you like the outdoors then you've struck gold, as it's right next to a National Park/Mountain Range; the Brecon Beacons.
Learning a few phrases in Welsh is always nice, and showing that you made an effort (no matter how small) will land you some friends.
If you're fairly built try out Rugby maybe, it's a religion here, especially with the World Cup coming up!
Don't be afraid if you can't understand the accent or people speak Welsh to you in greeting, we're accommodating to foreigners and everyone can speak English.
Accept Welsh Cakes and Bara brith as the greatest man made creations and be prepared to eat a fair amount of Lamb. God help you if you're a veggie.
Places you can't miss... Definitely the Gower Peninsula/Coastline, Snowdonia, Pembrokeshire Coast and the Brecons. Cardiff is a lovely city and together with Swansea will be the main 2 cities you'll visit (We only have 6 to begin with, and 2 of those are less than 5,000 pop in size!).
Cardiff at Christmas is brilliant! Definitely recommend!
There is a metric fuckton of castles all over Wales (We had a rebellious period) so those are good to visit too.
Make as many friends as you can, in general most Welsh are pretty proud of their local area, so if you show an interest they'll definitely show it off to you.
There aren't many practices and customs I can think of off the top of my head... we don't tip for one, and we drink a lot of alcohol, so watch out, don't go overboard if you're not into that.

Will throw in a HDMI to HDMI cable as I have a spare. £145 amazon but the price is so high due to limited supply and the design focus it has. The monitor design looks amazing and is a IPS 60hz.

And if you decide you like the show and want to return to the seasons you've skipped, then you've already spoilered yourself, which makes it less fun. 

Even more importantly, you don't grow with the characters. You miss out on understanding why a particular character is acting a certain way. You also miss out on the emotional connections you make by watching a character go through these things, and I think that emotional connection is a crucial aspect of appreciating Doctor Who. 

That's how I approach any sort of series, be it book or movie or tv show. If skipping around in a series has never bothered you before then I don't think it would bother you here. As others have noted, Doctor Who changes all the time anyway, from new Doctor-actors with their new personalities, to new companions, to new plot arcs, so it's not terribly critical to watch in order. 

And it is true that many Whovians will prefer some seasons or doctors or companions over others. Personally, I loved everything except this past season, because I can't stand the current companion. My BF loved the first season (Eccleston will be his one and only Doctor forever) but couldn't make it through Tennant's run (while Season 4 is my all time fave!). So what people here are saying is accurate: if the first season didn't do it for you, then it's very possible that a different combination of doctor or companions or writers might work better for your tastes.

Indecisive. The haunted look of defeat. Why even Ed Balls has all but given up on Ed” (page 25); “Why HALF of Ed’s MPs have already thrown in the towel” (page 37); “Labour is still a threat, despite the shambles” (editorial).

&gt;Sunday Telegraph: “Boots chief: Labour win would cause ‘catastrophe’” (page 1 splash); “Tis the season of misty memories and Labour forgetfulness” (page 18); “Ed tried to ‘weaponise’ the NHS – it ended with a bang” (page 22); “The case against Mr Miliband grows stronger” (editorial).

&gt;The Sun on Sunday: “Edache” (page 2); “Numpty-dumpty” (page 14); “Trouble at Mili” (editorial). By contrast, the Sunday Times carried only two articles: “Win or lose, it’s civil war for Labour” (page 16); “Cameron’s chaos theory is winning as he stokes up fear of Miliband” (page 23).

The driver was trying to turn left and there was no bike box at the junction to sit at so two cyclists were sitting behind the line to the inside of the truck at the light. Well the cyclists when the light turned green to go straight and the truck decided to turn left right into them.

Not to mention I had a bus driver yell at me this morning as it was pulling out of a bus stop to turn left at a red light on waterloo bridge. There is no where for the bus to go because of the line of cars in the right hand lane and I was coming up inbetween the two lanes as the bus had been stopped then the bus pulled out as I was between it and the line of cars to my right stopped at the right to cut me off. It is a very dangerous position to be in as a cyclist pinched between a bus and a line of cars. I went around the bus to get to the bike box and she yelled at me because she was signaling to get over (there was no where for her to go as the stopped cars would of blocked her to get into the turning lane)

This shit has to stop between drivers and cyclists. If you are in a vehicle, you can kill someone. 10 minutes later I see another cyclist get hit by a truck. There need to be more bike boxes and cars should be fine for being in the box or the lanes and drivers need to seriously understand they can end someone's life and act safely while driving.",null,0,null,1438362890,null,0,false,0,ctmzomb,null,t3_3f9v3v,null,t1_ctmzomb,null,t1_ctmsjkn,null,null,null,1440203383,null,24,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,24,null
