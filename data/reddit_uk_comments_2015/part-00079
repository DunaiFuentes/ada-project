I suspect Schweinsteiger and somebody of Turkish descent that might have been in Germany after the 2010 world cup and Emre's birth in 2011. The Turkish parent would need some link with Liverpool. 

The ages don't quite add up (unless time travel is involved), but the hairlines do, one of Emre's fathers is [Nuri Şahin] (http://i.imgur.com/OPfcrsg.png) which raises the possibility that Bayern signed Emre before he was born enough to sign for Dortmund. Nuri left Dortmund in 2011 to look for a place for Emre to grow up and become great. He'd heard Xabi was doing something similar and signed for Real Madrid to learn more. Xabi must have told him to see if Liverpool would suit, so Nuri demanded the loan here for the 2012/13 season and did what he could to get back to Dortmund, potentially to grow old with Emre's other father.

As it's the last matchday of the season, the chances are a lot of them will have very good atmospheres regardless of the reputations of the teams involved. In some ways, it's one of the most exciting days of the lower league calendar. Kickoffs for all the matches below are 12:15.

Looking at the fixture list, somewhat surprisingly there are actually no London clubs playing at home that day, though. The nearest games (all about an hour's travel from Central London, in various directions) are:

**Crawley vs. Coventry**

At the moment, both sides are fighting in a relegation scrap- for Coventry, this is especially surprising, as they have traditionally been a much bigger club than their current situation. Either side still need points to survive in this division for next season from this match, so it is likely to be a tense affair.

**Colchester vs. Preston**

Colchester are another side fighting relegation, while Preston are near the very top of the table, so this could be something of a mismatch- but that's not a bad thing. Both sides are likely to need the points to help their respective causes, not to mention having their positions affected my matches elsewhere, and this could result in a very interesting spectacle.

**Gillingham vs. Notts County**

While Gillingham have just about hauled themselves away from the relegation battle, Notts County are still very much involved, so this could be a very open match. If Gillingham's current good form continues, they could even be pushing for a playoff position. I'm biased as a Gillingham fan myself, but our fans do seem to have a reputation for making quite a bit of noise, particularly in the Rainham End.",null,0,null,1425170859,null,0,false,0,cp0e2t1,null,t3_2xi40k,null,t1_cp0e2t1,null,t3_2xi40k,null,null,null,1427510920,null,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2,null

(iii) if we sold him we would then have to buy an English player whose primary reason for signing is to increase the English quota in the squad, not to necessarily start games; young English talent as we know has become increasingly over priced of late with talents like Shaw going for well over what they're really worth.

I would like us to sign Barkley in the summer, as he could be moulded into a primary threat within our system. But at this time, I think we would really miss Milner, he's our most versatile player and no matter whether he actually starts or not, he always approaches every game with the same mentality; go out there and give it all for the team.

null,false,SleepyDustKing,null,null,null,"&gt; This whole article all rides on the basis of one trusting the story of a murderous raving lunatic.

Firstly, he was not a ""murderous lunatic"" when he began to make these accusations. The whole argument is that the actions of MI5 had a part in creating the man we see today. 

&gt; All of this info comes from Cage, a heavily biased pro-Islamist group that has in the past supported senior Al Queda operatives..

Yet all the counter evidence comes from the Government and the security services that are being criticised. If we are to learn anything from history, it is that we must be sceptical of what our rulers tell us. Look at the Iraq war for instance. Look at illegal rendition, mass surveillance, tax avoidance, etc. Who would you rather trust? 

&gt; It's also ridiculous that we get the full blame for it.

Firstly, it is not ""you"" who is getting the full blame. CAGE are arguing the MI5 are partly culpable for what has happened. Read the whole report. Secondly, you are not the government. You are not the MI5. Criticism of the government entities is not a criticism of yourself. Stop conflating the two. 

&gt; The truth is none of the still-stable Middle Eastern countries want Islamic extremists to come back to their own country.

Yes I agree with you here, of course no country wants the instability that rebellion brings. But the important question to ask here is what started this rebellion? What causes this anger and distrust? If we span back over the past century we see that a history of structural violence, theft of natural resources, political oppression, foreign invasions and so on, has lead to an anti-western sentiment across such countries. Nothing happens in isolation. 

&gt; It's true that our intelligence services did fuck up, but really I don't believe even 20% of the story that's been cooked up.

I don't believe even 5% of what the Home Office and MI5 have said. I often converse with the Home Office, and let me tell you, they are far from an honest institution.

 [**School Reunion**](https://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/School%20Reunion): [](#sfw) 

---
&gt;
&gt;___School Reunion___ was the third episode of the second series of BBC Wales *Doctor Who*. It continued from the prelude established in *Tardisode 3*.
&gt;The episode marked the return of Sarah Jane Smith and K9 Mark III, both having last appeared on-screen in 1983's *The Five Doctors*.

1) Carlisle is on the boarder with Scotland
2) A sort-of local derby, basically we are pretty close (not really if I am honest) to each other and play each other dead regularly, so bragging rights are important.
3) Either one or both of these sides will be relegated into the dreaded Conference. It seems almost certain at this point that Hartlepool will be for the first ever time in their history, and whilst Carlisle are doing a lot better than Hartlepool, they are still in a relegation dog fight.

Seriously, this will be your classic no nonsense, hearts on sleeves, passions flaring, emotional event in which basically 22 blokes kick each other whilst a few thousand drunk people shout abuse at other drunk people. This is the epitome of the working class game!

From that point on I was hooked. But it's taken a few years to realize how maddening being a Spurs fan really is.  
  
Right now, we're a talented team with core players who are young and can only get better from here, but the frustration lies in the underachieving nature of each season. Consistent 5th/6th place finishes in the league (always above Arsenal...) combined with crashing out of cup competitions earlier than expected makes watching Spurs gut wrenching at times. And then you get a year like 2012, where we earned Champions League football but had it wrenched away by Chelsea.  
  
Also, we often groom some of the best talent (Berbatov, Bale, Modric, etc), but can never hold onto them. And when we do sell, the money used from that transfer is (often) wasted on players who don't fit our system. It's been awful watching Soldado struggle so much these past two seasons- he's a great player, but not the right one for our style of play right now.

Yup, that's the basic premise of it. The difference is that they won't stop killing until everyone believes what they believe. We stop killing when they're dead.

Right, I get that. I'm suggesting that rather than trying to address those causes, we simply kill everyone who subscribes to that movement.

Eh, it's not really genocidal as islamists aren't really a genus, or race, or specific ethnicity. They're a self-selected group of people with (actual) genocidal beliefs.

Regardless, my culture and beliefs are objectively better than theirs, and they want a world where only their beliefs are allowed, and only their extreme islamist culture is allowed to exist.

Flying from London will be your fastest (and least weather-dependent) option.  Play around with budget airline sites / Expedia / Kayak and so forth for the best prices, as per usual.  [National Express](http://www.nationalexpress.com/home.aspx) operate semi-frequent buses to Stansted and Luton. You can find more frequent and more reliable buses to Heathrow and Gatwick with the Oxford Bus Company [here](http://airline.oxfordbus.co.uk/).

But, from Oxford, Birmingham Airport is also an easy trip by rail.  A train from Oxford to Birmingham International is less than an hour.  Play about with timetables on National Rail [here](http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/).  

TL;DR: don't bother with the ferry.  Find the best flights to Dublin, and work your public transport around that.  This may take some time for you to research.  Favour Heathrow, Gatwick, and Birmingham over Luton or Stansted.

null,false,Brian,null,null,null,"&gt;For the final time. State pensions are not being funded from the money pensioners

And for the final time - that is completely irrelevant.  Read what I said again:

&gt;&gt;  That was indeed what they were told they were getting from the deal. And indeed, it is what they are getting. Where the exact piece of money comes from is not the issue here

If I pay a shopkeeper for a loaf of bread, it doesn't matter that they never used that same money to buy the bread from their supplier (they clearly couldn't).  All that matters is that they said they'd give me the bread in exchange for the money they paid.  They can't turn around and say, ""Yeah, you paid for bread, but you look pretty well off, so I've decided to give the money you gave me to charity instead and not give you it"".

And even if they're not funding **their** pensions, they've still been funding the pension system - that money didn't just vanish, it was what allowed us to run that system for their lifetimes.  It really did pay for pensions.

&gt;The current generation of pensioners did not contribute enough via National Insurance Contributions

Hence my point about why we still hold failing companies subject to their debts.  That just means **we** fucked up - we can't forfeit on what we agreed on just because it was more expensive than we expected.  If the shopkeeper finds their sales don't cover their operating expenses, they can't just demand our money for nothing, they need to either fix it for *future* transactions or fold.

And even if it wasn't enough, it was still a lot.  At a minimum, if we were going to do that, we'd need to provide them with their NI contributions back, in lieu of a pension, if we weren't going to honor what they paid for.

&gt;Huge amounts of money are being spent on state pensions for people who are not only quite capable of living comfortably without them

So raise taxes.  Trying to raise that money by throwing away your integrity in what you promised in return for a paltry sum that'll come nowhere near covering those bases (hell, I'm not sure it'll even cover your costs) seems *incredibly* stupid.  Or you could, as I mentioned in my very first post, **change** how we provide pensions to one that is more in line with benefits, rather than the NI system.

It's a protective coating but it's not a lubricant and will likely prevent lubricant working properly. 

Clean your chain and apply chain lube ONLY. 

A heads up though, I've just finished a can of Wurth and I wasn't impressed. It's not every thick and I'd say it's not suitable for winter. I got a can of Castrol spray lube and it's much better. It's waxier and my chain's been much healthier. 

Correct procedure is to give the bike a PROPER clean. Then cover it all in ACF50. The lot.
Avoiding hand controls, instruments, lights, brakes, chain tyres. I cannot emphasise the brakes and tyres enough. The stuff hangs around, it took a week of riding before my brakes got back to normal after I got some on my discs. 


Wipe off excess ACF 50, leaving an even coating and spray some onto a rag and work it onto things like fork stanchions and exposed metalwork by hand. 

DO NOT wash the bike until good weather returns. Otherwise you're just removing your hard work.

Personally, I agree with the age limits of A2 to A. 

What I disagree with is the A1 part. I do not think 17-19year olds should be restricted to a 125. A 125 is not a viable mode of transport in a country of motorways where people regularly travel 80-90 mph. 

I think 17 year olds upon passing a full test should be allowed up to 25bhp. So you can buy a 250-300. An actually useable motorbike. 

Currently what is the incentive to get any form of proper training until you are 19?! Being on a CBT until 19 will kill people. CBT's are worth the paper they are printed on. 

I, for a fact know that if I had 100+ BHP at 18. I would be dead or most certainly have had an accident. I began riding at 20 and I was still immature enough to really push my luck several times on a 125. Thankfully slower speeds and longer thinking times saved my hide. 

In my opinion, this would make more sense:

- remove the 16 year old CBT. 50cc peds are stupid. 
- keep the current CBT rules over 17 but reduce the length it's valid to 1 year. To prevent serial CBT'ists. It's supposed to be for training. 
- 17 full test: 25bhp (A1)
- 19: 47.5bhp (A2)
- 2 years of valid A2: A unrestricted
- Keep DAS at 24

Instead of repeating a full test at each stage, it should be a CBT style day course with a qualified examiner who evaluates your ability. Not a double test. 

47.5 BHP is plenty when learning. And within your first few years YOU ARE learning. I know it sounds annoying to anyone under 24 but I'm 25 now and my thought processes are very different than they were at 18 or 20. 

I've never been a carefree idiot but I'm perfectly ok that I had no access to full power bikes in my late teens/early 20's. 

We cannot escape the fact that modern bikes are CRAZY fast. 18 year olds should not be allowed access to something that can outrun a Veyron, because it's in your make up, to push your luck at that age.

Getting a mortgage should be easy, if time consuming, because you already have a 50% deposit so you just need to worry about proving your income. 

What you and your mum want to do is known as a ""transfer of equity"" which happens all the time, although usually as part of a divorce. The process is:

* you and your mum agree a fair price for her half, say £125k
* your mortgage company gives £125k to your conveyancer
* your conveyancer sends this to your mum's conveyancer
* your conveyancer also deals with the reams of fiendish land registry and mortgage paperwork 
* you now own all of it

It gets tricky because you already own half of it and you probably want to own it jointly with your partner afterwards. Or maybe your partner could buy your mum out and leave you out of the process. It gets even more complex if there is currently a mortgage on the property too. Other problems include if the price isn't true market value which causes HMRC to start sniffing about.

I'm not quite sure where I got 'a number of years' from but I do think it's strange for a discussion about a possible penalty fare (off the top of my head, are they not a maximum of £80, maybe doubling to £160 if not repaid within a certain period?) to progress to bailiffs seeking to recover several times this. I suspect there's been something you can challenge to reduce the amount you need to pay. 

Also, regarding your concerns about information being reported to the credit credit reference agencies, in a situation where a debt has arisen as a result of something other than a credit product or a contractual billing system (such as a mobile phone or utilities company) I'd only expect information to be reported if a court awarded judgment against you and you failed to keep to pay the amounts due within 28 days. Again, it's unlikely the matter has progressed that far without your knowledge and there will probably be things you could challenge if they have. 

Therefore, if a debt collector has bought the right to pursue you in relation to the penalty fare from the train company/National Rail and has reported adverse information like late payments or a default to the credit reference agencies, I doubt it had legitimate grounds to do so. I'd ask it to remove anything it has reported for the reasons above and tell it your willing to pay a fair amount to resolve if it does things properly.

I don't like Islam either, and I'll explain why. It's a backward ideology, which preaches old-fashioned values such as very poor tolerance of homosexuality. This is true of all religions to some extent, but I think Islam makes integration into British society more challenging overall. For example, it prevents followers from eating the same food as most people (must be halal), restricting social activities (can't drink alcohol, can't have sex), and fraternising with members of the opposite sex. I'm not saying that to be properly British you have to drink beer, eat bacon and fuck everything that moves - but being forbidden from (or actively against) commonplace things certainly makes integration more difficult and ensures that Muslims end up sticking with other Muslims. I have a few Muslim friends, but we can't go to an Italian restaurant and get a pizza because it isn't halal. So we always go for Pakistani food (which is fine because it's tasty, but it definitely restricts options). My Muslim colleagues would never come to any work events if there would be alcohol present, and definitely wouldn't go and hang out in the pub after work. It definitely led to them being seen as outsiders to some extent.

Islam also goes hand in hand with many cultural practices which aren't acceptable in the UK in 2015, such as arranged/forced marriages, the expected roles of women (subservience), and routine male circumcision, which I also disagree with.

As for what he said about ""lefties"", I think it does highlight some sort of contradiction from the typically left wing thought process. Generally they preach tolerance and equality, support drug legalisation etc - but they still defend a religion and cultural practices which is VERY anti-homosexual, still represses women and is vehemently conservative when it comes to drugs.

I don't have a specific problem with Muslim *people*, but I definitely don't want their beliefs to spread and become more common in the UK. I think it would be overall taking a step backwards, towards a less tolerant society in general. I think their religion pretty much represents the type of thinking we should be moving AWAY from, not embracing. You have to ask yourself whether the UK would be a better place if we accepted more Islamic values overall.

Yes that works quite well. You might as well put the full 2,500 in there. Just make absolutely sure you xfer the interest back into your savings, it's often paid monthly. Otherwise you're effectively getting 0% on it if you just absorb the interest into your spending money.

Why not put the rest in an ISA? Or split between an ISA so you have easy-access, and a longer-term bond to get a higher rate and still have some locked away.

If you can pay in 1k a month, nationwide gives you 5% in-credit interest on flexdirect by the way, up to £2,500. That equates to about £10 a month in interest.

The important point you're deliberately ignoring is that present day pensioners NICs over their working life don't come close to covering the generous benefits they gave themselves.

I think you're suggestion of just giving them their NICs back is an excellent idea. That would probably just about cover a means tested state pension which is exactly what I'm suggesting. We could scrap the winter fuel allowance too.

 I think it helps to think monthly rather than yearly. You are budgeting £1000 a year for going out, sports, clothes, holidays, gym, gifts etc etc... That is less than £20/week which seems very low to me.  Also you forgot car insurance and other costs. 
  
I calculate your take home to be £1482.89/ month. If you want to save £6k/year (£500/month) that leaves £982.89 to spend on everything. If you are going to be spending £600 on rent alone, £382.89 seems low for all other bills and spending.  
  
I would definitely suggest finding somebody to share with. That will halve your council tax, Internet, tv licence etc. Go to spareroom.co.uk or look on gumtree.

null,false,TheHighlandChieftain,null,null,null,"&gt;The consequence for the British is they have no go-to default second language that would open the world to them. Hindsight would have everyone learn Esperanto, but history hasn't played that way.

The British do indeed have the advantage that they speak English from birth as it is a widely spoken second language. However, that does not mean Brits *shouldn't* learn another language. 

Why? Because foreign languages are damned useful as evidenced by the article above. And languages bring with them an exposure to foreign culture that is not only useful but also interesting from a human perspective. Just because many people can speak to you in English doesn't mean that it's not worth being able to speak to the ones who don't.

&gt;Think about it; a Brit might choose to invest a lot of energy in learning... German, but that only opens up dialogue in a few states; Germany, Switzerland and Austria. Maybe they'd choose French, which opens up France and some parts of Africa. 

In the EU: 

* Spanish - 400 million native speakers/ 550 million total (partially intelligible with Portuguese) **UN official language**.
* Portuguese 215 million native speakers/ 255 million total ( "" "" "" Spanish)
* German 89 million native speakers / 95 million total
* French 74 million native speakers / 274 million total **UN official language**.

[wiki source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_total_number_of_speakers)

Outside the EU you already have Mandarin, Arabic, Russian and so on that allow you a unique inside to some of these cultures.
This idea that there are no other useful languages to learn for native English speakers is absolute nonsense. The world is too global for us to be complacent to the point of assuming that everyone will be speaking English! 

We should use the fact that many already speak English as a motivation to learn other languages -  they have an advantage over us as they can speak to us *and then some*.

Zero tolerance trialled I the late nineties by the Met, was directly influenced by mayor Giuliani's NYC police force.  The targeted stop and search of minorities as a policy comes from there.

To a lesser extent we also take bad ideas from their criminal justice system, which is one of the reasons overcrowding during incarceration is an issue here, as well as there.

Personally, I wouldn't say ten years, just that in certain arenas, we take our lead from poster boy for bad law enforcement.

The British abolished slavery and used the Royal Navy to enforce the ban on other world powers so I don't really know what you are getting at there. Also the Indian Civil Service was very meritocratic compared to other institutions of the time and many Indians served in it.

The British simply weren't powerful enough to 'enslave' India (nor was it desirable to do so) they governed with the consent of the population.

And nowadays India is a great country and enjoys many of the benefits of the Raj years such as infrastructure (railways, ports etc.) and institutions (a fair legal system, relatively uncorrupt political system relative to nations in similar conditions).

null,false,alexgmcm,eng-sussex,Sussex,null,"&gt;You're clueless if you think invading other countries, subjugation of those countries by military force and exploiting their people/resources is a positive thing


We didn't subjugate via military force - we are a tiny island, the math just doesn't work out. Remember India was pretty developed as well - it wasn't like you could just turn up with the Maxim gun and state your terms.

The Empire governed with the consent of the people - most of the Army involved in putting down the Mutiny were Indian themselves, there aren't enough British people to control India.

Being a member of the British Empire meant having stable institutions (the Indian Civil Service, reliable banks), infrastructure investment (most British financiers invested in the Empire, not the UK itself), a safe trading market, progressive politics (abolition of slavery, parliamentary democracy etc.), cutting-edge science and technology and so on.

It was just far better to be part of the British Empire than it was to be part of a caste-based tribal country ruled by arbitrary warlords and thus why it was popular enough to survive.

&gt;If British rule is so positive, why did we let the colonies have their independence.

Because we respected their right to self-determination?

The funny thing is that Britain did have something similar - the Roman Empire. But Britain was far better off for being governed by Rome than it was being left as a tribal backwater.

And nowadays we are all governed (in a more subtle way) by the Americans and again we benefit from the peace and progressive values that we enjoy under their hegemony. It is true that America might benefit more due to the level of influence it has with the WTO, IMF etc. and the fact that the dollar is the reserve currency but we _all_ benefit more than we would do without America.

There were awful tragedies like the famine - but how bad would the famine have been without even the organisation of the Indian Civil Service to even begin to attempt to address it, or at least to document it. Worse things happen in other nations but we have less knowledge due to poor organisation and documentation.

India benefited from the Empire at that point in time - if it didn't Britain was simply too weak to subjugate it. ",null,0,null,1425203960,null,0,false,0,cp0pw3n,null,t3_2xjhb4,null,t1_cp0pw3n,null,t1_cp0prqj,null,null,null,1427516573,null,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

Are you really dumb, or just wilfully ignorant? ""Tribal""? India had the Indus Valley civilization at a time before the Celtic tribes were roaming around in Britain. And all this talk about ""caste"" coming from a person living in  a country with a monarchy, where classism is prevalent, and a hereditary peerage system exists. In any case the British did nothing about the caste system.


You can continue your self-righteous narrative of how the British liberated the ""tribal"" natives, introduced them to civilization, and how India is better off for it.

Did you have the government state that that is what you'd get, as is the case for NI?  No - because the best you get for taxation is manifesto promises, which aren't government policy, only party policy (and even then, get harshly criticised if broken).

Go to the government [website](https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance/overview) for National insurance, and you'll be told exactly what NI entitles you to, down to direct [pension calculations](https://www.gov.uk/calculate-state-pension) for how much you'll get based on how many years you contribute.  No such guarantees exist for taxes.  Again, you may disagree that this is how pensions **should** have been organised, but it is the one they were, for the entire duration of these people's lives.

&gt;A group of workers split the cost of 1 loaf of bread for a pensioner. 30 years later they walk into Tesco's claiming they're owed a loaf of bread each.

You left out the part where Tescos promised they would give them that loaf of bread 30 years later in exchange.  Given that that was my entire point, it seems a bit of an oversight to leave it out.

&gt;The important point you're deliberately ignoring

I'm not ignoring it - I've explicitly pointed out that it's entirely irrelevant.  Where the money comes from does not address my point, which is about what basis that money was accepted on, and what obligations the government incurred in making that arrangement.

&gt;We could scrap the winter fuel allowance too.

The winter fuel allowance is fine - that's a state benefit, not something covered by NI.  Make that means tested by all means.  However, you can only do stuff with the money you actually have - you don't take other people's by reneging on such agreements, save by those means by which we already have legally viable mechanisms for (ie. taxes).",null,0,null,1425205925,null,0,1425206187,0,cp0q980,null,t3_2xcgtz,null,t1_cp0q980,null,t1_cp0p2to,null,null,null,1427516743,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

&gt; It was a Mughal practice. The British continued it as we largely just influenced the local leaders rather than completely controlling the country

That is absolutely no reason to continue the practice. The British ended horrendous practices like [Sati](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sati_%28practice%29#British_India) - an act that led to one of my favourite historical quotes: 

*""This burning of widows is your custom; prepare the funeral pile. But my nation has also a custom. When men burn women alive we hang them, and confiscate all their property. My carpenters shall therefore erect gibbets on which to hang all concerned when the widow is consumed. Let us all act according to national customs.""*

So the British were well capable of imposing their customs on the local populace, even for good. There was no reason to blow people up with cannons *just because it was a local custom*.

Yes, people ought to have the right to do what they want with their bodies. Yes, people will do it regardless of legality. Of course, it's better if this were all done above board where the state can ensure that this all occurs safely and consensually. 

But it's as if barbarism always finds a way in that industry. Germany has a nice model, where prostitutes can rent rooms in a brothel, pimping is illegal, police are on call at the brothel if anything goes wrong, etc. But I watched a documentary on this where prostitutes in Germany described that many prostitutes there were doing that job because their ""boyfriend"" was making them. So non-consensual prostitution was still happening, and there was not much the state could do about it, as the prostitutes with ""boyfriend"" wouldn't admit they were being pimped when asked. 

But then, what can the state do if someone is given resources to get out of this situation but doesn't respond to it? And wouldn't this still be happening (but with fewer protections) if prostitution was banned? Again, there doesn't seem to be a clear-cut way of dealing with the problem.

null,false,sqwobbler,null,null,null,"It's not so much I believe we would end up 'ruining' another English talent, its more of if we brought someone in they wouldn't necessarily start for us. If we bought Barkley or Berahino there's no guarantee that they will start immediately within our system, with Yaya still being the presence that he is, and the qualities of Silva and Nasri in attack there just seems to be no real room for a player Barkley, who needs consistent playing time if he is to develop into one of the top English talents; part and parcel to why Sterling is becoming more and more of a force. If we were to sign someone like Ward-Prowse, who's showing great signs of potential, I'd honestly prefer that because i believe he isn't a solid starter at southampton but does get games here and there, and shows signs of improving with an impressive work rate and hard training ethic (I believe a teammate of his came out and said he's always putting extra hours in because of his willingness/desire to improve), plus I don't think we would cost an arm and a leg. We could utilise him in perhaps a rotational or maybe even backup role for the 1st team whilst he develops.

We should definitely keep Milner in the squad, but I just don't want us to see us spend through the teeth on one player just because he's English talent, when there would be better options looking elsewhere.

He should always be one of the first on the team sheet for these sorts of games. When we haven't got possession (which is quite often against these kinds of teams), he is essential. His work rate is amazing. It's not like his technical skills are poor either - they are good but when you are comparing to players like Silva and Nasri it's kind of hard for him.

Well, yeah - if I promised someone something, took money for it, listed what I would provide in exchange, I think I'd feel obligated to provide it.  Wouldn't you?

&gt;Well today's pensioners didn't pay enough in national insurance contributions to finance their universal state pension

For the very rich you're talking about, this is almost certainly not true - national insurance increases depending on how much you earn, while state pension payments are fixed.  You would almost certainly be paying more back to those people if you refunded their money than they would take out as their pension.  Indeed, they are really the *only* ones who have paid more than they take out - the poorer ones are effectively being subsidised by them. 

&gt;but personally I feel scrapping welfare benefits for people in genuine need

That's the same Kuwait that was invaded by Iraq in 1990. That's right! Iraq. A fellow Muslim country. Iraq proceeded to kill over 1000 Kuwaitis and set fire to all the Kuwaiti oilfields. Who rushed to Kuwait's rescue? Was it Iran? Or maybe Pakistan? No. It was America. A western country. And yet apparently it is western foreign policy that is to blame for radicalising Emwazi. 

Also, if I can be honest, I get a little tired of hearing that Muslims across the west are being radicalised because ""we"" are invading Muslim countries. Most Muslims in Britain are of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin. They have nothing in common with the people of Gaza or Iraq or Syria other than religion - they don't speak the same language or have the same culture or share the same customs. The only thing they have in common is religion. And you know what? When Saddam Hussein was killing hundreds of thousands of Kurdish Muslims, they said nothing. When Assad barrel-bombed his own population, they said nothing. For decades across the Muslim world, dictators, despots and sects have slaughtered each other in their millions, and western Muslims haven't seemed particularly bothered. But as soon as there is western military intervention, suddenly the people of Bradford and Birmingham and Whitechapel are horrified by Muslim suffering.

I'm Jewish. Over the last half century I've seen the only Jewish country (whether you want to recognise it or not) in the world invaded over and over by Muslim countries. I've seen Jewish communities who have lived peacefully in Muslim countries for centuries kicked out without warning. By your logic, I should be fully radicalised against Islamic foreign policy by now. Me and my fellow Jews across the western world should be forming cells and travelling to Pakistan and Bangladesh and Iraq and Yemen and beheading women and children in protest at Islamist foreign policy.

null,false,chilari,eng-shropshire,Shropshire,null,"A service-based economy relies on a strong economy. If nobody has disposable income, then there's less demand for jobs in places selling luxury and entertainment things, like cinemas, game shops and so on. A service-based economy is also rather inwardly looking: local people are buying, so the money moves around internally, but there's little injection from outside the community. So once the community starts to struggle, unless something comes along to give it a big injection from outside, it ends up in a downward spiral. Nobody spends their money, so shops shut, so there are fewer people with money, so more shops shut. A manufacturing-based economy has a product that can be exported outside the community. Money is coming into it all the time as long as a larger economy - the region or country or European or global economy has sufficient buying power and the products being produced are in demand. If there's a problem within the local economy, but external buyers are still sending money into it, it's a lot easier to weather and it doesn't result in a downwards spiral.

Of course there are weaknesses with manufacturing economies too. But having an economy based heavily in one sector - service in this case - especially when that sector is inward looking, is dangerous. A mixed economy, where money moves around internally and products or services are exported to bring new money into the economy is stronger.

As for the second trend, income equality has historically let to revolution, and revolution is disruptive to the economy. Income inequality also means that, while a few people might be spending lots, the vast majority of people are struggling. The economy becomes dependent on those rich few, while the masses compete for jobs. The rich few therefore have a lot of power because if they're not happy about something, and decide to pull out their support, it could spell disaster for a whole economy.",null,0,null,1425208950,null,0,false,0,cp0qswx,null,t3_2xibfm,null,t1_cp0qswx,null,t1_cp0nci1,null,null,null,1427516999,null,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

According to [this](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-16479569) it works out at about £10bn total subsidies, which includes the Barnett formula and that additional spending you're talking about. 

What else does that additional spending include? Well, about £1.6bn would be knocked off it instantly since we would no longer be contributing to the UK's armed forces. Another few hundred million was knocked off with the Tories' cuts over Christmas, and now UKIP, who could very well be part of the next government, are promising to slash a few billion more off. That's not including eliminating all the duplication of services that goes on due to running two governments for one country.

The argument has always been a weak one, since subsidies are a shit substitute for a functioning economy, but UKIP reducing the figure a United Ireland would need to borrow (if the south hasn't returned to a budget surplus by then), and unionists supporting it, is a bit of an own goal is the point.",null,0,null,1425208996,null,0,false,0,cp0qt7h,null,t3_2xjmnb,null,t1_cp0qt7h,null,t1_cp0qexb,null,null,null,1427517002,null,5,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,5,null

You are taking the issues that are on the frontiers of liberalism today and complaining that they weren't being considered two centuries ago. But the frontiers were different two centuries ago when in many world powers you wouldn't have a fair trial, it was an absolute monarchy, administration was based on nepotism, education was solely religious in nature etc.

By today's standard the British Empire was horrible - compared to it's contemporaries though it was very enlightened and helped bring about the better world we enjoy today.

The part of the card that's actually going to expand is the heatsink, the traces and solder points are so small that the expansion there is probably negligible. The heatsink is attached by 4 screws and they're all close together, so the displacement between them will be veeery small. Also, the heatsink never gets as hot as the core temp.

The government.  A legal institution that *was* around then, and is the one that actually made those agreements, and whose money you are talking about.  Read the links I gave - they spell out *exactly* what people are entitled to given their payments, down to exact figures.

&gt;Previous generations had no right to promise on the behalf of future generations

In what sense?  They certainly did legally, just as your parents can spend their own money rather than guarantee you inherit it.  Dispense with the ability to make binding agreements and you simply **can't** run a government at all.  After all, every single decision they make is going to affect all future generations - often far more than pensions, from the national deficit, to taxes, to money spent on infrastructure.  Would you argue that past governments had no right to build roads, hospitals and services, since we had no say in the cost for those, rather than having that money available now?

Would you be fine if this was argued in reverse - eg. that current generations didn't pay the costs of setting up our roads and national health service, so they should be taxed extra to have access to them?

And whether you agree with it or not, that's exactly what they did do.  That's simply not your money, or the governments money, under the terms they gave.  You can't just arbitrarily comandeer it, and doing so would actually be a really bad idea, for all the reasons I gave, compared to the more sane ones like taxation.

All of them are at least undergraduates. They do not fit into the tropes of exploited sex worker or druggies or what not. 

They are all indies and make piles of money. They will moan endlessly about unpleasant punters but they seem like fairly normal people with a lot of free time due to their extremely high pay rates. 

They moan even more about eastern European girls who undercut them significantly. You can see this on saafe again whereby they had 2000+ views a day now they get 200-600 a week. The EE folks are the ones with pimps and are controlled. The internet has essentially destroyed the pimp.

Surprisingly all of them pay tax (which is where I come into the picture yet again as I am a tax accountant) because they need to legitimise the money for when they buy big things. They don't declare it all though they do declare *some* but it is hard to buy a house in cash without the government poking their noses in. They all call themselves alternative therapists. 

You can look on saafe.info and most of them are normal people who are sensible enough to split the personal and professional lives.

There is some jealousy from normal people, for instance D got a brand new FireBlade things we have to save up for years for.

Of those about 3 of them are completely open about it their families know they advertise without covering their faces even have twitter accounts with their faces on it.

A lot of them came to the conclusion I could work for a pittance for years and see fuck all, or I could do this. They had plenty of choices and time/money/effort/stuff in their lives meant this was the better choices they had. How many of you had a fully paid off mortgage by the age of 23?

You talk to them and the ones that get bitter/twisted and exploited are the ones that don't save their money and spent it like water. Realise their youth is about to run out and have little to show for it or no plan to get out and it eats away at them... the thing is the same can be said of most professionals. The bullying in accountancy ate away at me for years.

Though age != lower value. K for instance she's 50 and does an enormous amount of business because her profile is honest and she does everything she says she does. She makes more than her 20 year old friend.

But they do get robbed now and again, they get round this by sharing intel with each other again there are various boards around the net sharing pictures phone numbers and info on bad guys. Again you can read on saafe.

You cannot argue that privatisation is always going to guarantee a better service than a public service.  Every week there is a different story about the energy companies - whether it is miss-selling, price cartels, difficult to switch, confusing tariffs, heck the latest story this week was that the price comparison sites have been rigging their recommendations.  Only a complete cretin would argue privatising energy companies has worked out well for the public.

The TLDR of Thatcher Era:  ""a lot of people got wealthier, a lot of people got poorer"".  The central argument used by both Reagan and Thatcher neo-liberals was ""the trickle down effect"", if you make the rich richer that will benefit everyone.  That theory has been utterly and totally discredited.

null,false,SleepyDustKing,null,null,null,"&gt; Whilst you're busy blaming the west for radicalising Emwazi,  

I'm looking at the causes, it so happens that we are PARTLY culpable, and we should do everything within out power to stop these factors contributing to extremism.

In response to the invasion of Kuwait, Sadam Hussien was a ruler put in power by our own governments. In 1963, Saddam Hussein worked with the CIA to carry out the coup by the Baath party, which eventually brought him to power in Iraq. Using the money he earnt from the exports of oil, he was able to form a top down authoritarian state that didn't need a popular consensus as we do in the West, because he didn't need taxes from his citizens. If you wan to learn more about the history of Iraq, read David Fromkins ""A Peace to End all Peace"", or the work of Professor Charles R H Trip, an expert of Middle Eastern history and autocracy. 

&gt; Also, if I can be honest, I get a little tired of hearing that Muslims across the west are being radicalised because ""we"" are invading Muslim countries.

This is a quote from Jeffrey D. Sachs, a Professor of Sustainable Development and UN Special Adviser, in response to the Hebdo attacks earlier this year: 

""...terrorism is not rooted in insanity. It is more often an act of war, albeit war by the weak rather than by organized states and their armies. Islamist terrorism is a reflection, indeed an extension, of today’s wars in the Middle East. And with the meddling of outside powers, those wars are becoming a single regional war – one that is continually morphing, expanding, and becoming increasingly violent.""

source: http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/radical-islam-western-military-intervention-by-jeffrey-d-sachs-2015-01#HTUGb8ZlVsyFOl6j.99

&gt; For decades across the Muslim world, dictators, despots and sects have slaughtered each other in their millions, and western Muslims haven't seemed particularly bothered. 

That is an absolute load of rubbish, of course there have been many groups that have consistently campaigned over these issues. Just because you didn't care before, doesn't mean they didn't exist. 

&gt; over the last half century I've seen the only Jewish country (whether you want to recognise it or not) in the world invaded over and over by Muslim countries.

....You mean the same Israel that was formed out of a land once owned by the Arabs? You mean the same Israel that has killed thousands of innocent Palestinians? You seriously got it all messed up man. Pick up a bloody history book for gods sake.

null,false,TheDrCK,null,null,null,"&gt; how did the transition from HL to iWeb go? Was it fairly quick and painless? How does iWeb's service compare?

After reading that it could take close to a month for some transfers to get sorted, I was pleasantly surprised. One transfer form sent off and all completed within a fortnight (note: I sold all my holdings and transferred a single cash sum to minimise exit fees; the transfer might take longer if you plan on transferring a load of open funds). Both parties were very quick indeed to get things processed.

Clearly the iWeb platform is not as pretty as HL's, and may take a few days to get used to, but it still has all the information you need. Some have reported difficulty in finding specific funds, but I've never had a problem. [Take a look here](https://halifaxiweb.digitallook.com/funds), with [Vanguard's 80% Lifestrategy page](https://halifaxiweb.digitallook.com/security.cgi?isin=FUND:GB00B4PQW151) as an example.

The trades themselves have always gone through promptly, and they have a live chat support function. I've only used it once, when filling in the transfer form, and the query was resolved in no time at all. Plus they don't send a massive pile of marketing bullshit through the post each month, unlike HL.",null,0,null,1425212172,null,0,1425212370,0,cp0reil,null,t3_2xjvjg,null,t1_cp0reil,null,t1_cp0r3sp,null,null,null,1427517279,null,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2,null

In the 70s big companies like Plessey, Ferranti, ICL, etc could make good money from 'cost-plus' (you didn't even have to be efficient - just add a profit to whatever it cost) Defence contracts. In the City, bankers were sort of Gentlemen amateurs with 'my word is my bond' and a very slow sleepy approach. If you wanted to buy stocks it was a closed shop with outrageous commissions. There were continuous strikes, and one mining strike had resulted in coal supplies getting so low that a 3-day working week was imposed with rotating power cuts. Literally the power might go off at 8pm and you'd be in the dark until morning. Inflation was double-digit and a mortgage would cost you 11% interest or more.

It needed sorting out. The tap of 'free' Defence money was turned off. (None of the companies I mentioned still exists in their old form today.)  The City had the so-called ""Big Bang"" (deregulation) and the strikes were tackled head-on. Monetary policies were introduced to control inflation.

&gt;__The Pogues__ are a [Celtic punk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_punk) band from London, formed in 1982 and fronted by [Shane MacGowan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_MacGowan). The band reached international prominence in the 1980s and early 1990s. MacGowan left the band in 1991 due to drinking problems but the band continued first with [Joe Strummer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Strummer) and then with Spider Stacy on vocals before breaking up in 1996.  The band reformed in late 2001, and has been playing regularly ever since, on the US East Coast around [St Patrick's Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Patrick%27s_Day) and across the UK and Ireland. The group has yet to record any new music and, according to Spider Stacy on Pogues.com, has no inclination to do so.

Where Thatcher was wrong, was that she willingly shutdown these industries to create an permanent unemployed class or as Marx said, a reserve army of Labour, to keep wage inflation down. 
Benefits to be payed for by the North sea oil bonanza. 

Now we are living with same economic plan more or less with mass immigration.  Drive down wage inflation so we can compete with the east.

What she should of done as in Europe, is perhaps work with those industries and help them with reinvestment to increase the productivity of their workers so they can add more value to the products that would give them a competitive edge.
Instead due to her ideology she sacrificed whole industries without any alternative other than going on the bennys, which if you accounted for the benefits paid means that now we had workers of the important strategic industries that now produced nothing at all but were still subsidized by the government! So a bit of a logic fail there, at least the loss making industries were still adding some value and with the right help from government they could have thrived.

Now we have some bizarre economy that is just based on London, housing speculation, supermarkets and coffee shops. 

Thatcher was a short term success for Baby boomers that wanted to make a quick buck in a housing bubble, buy their council house or buy shares on the cheap from the sold off nationalized industries.
Long term for the average Brit she made us all poorer and introduced the ""I'm alright jack"" culture of naked greed that is so popular with all the boomers that voted for her.

If anyone is curious, my updated analysis of profanity rates and my new team sub activity rate analysis is still pending, as I ran into a bunch of subreddits that my script just gets stuck on for days on end, but it will happen. It ended up taking so long on some of the data that I may re-run it all for accuracy's sake, using several more computers to get an accurate simultaneous read, instead of the 4 I was using (we crushed the cunts on both counts with my current data, by the way.)

You have to consider the sort of state the country was in when she came to power:

 - Most of our power stations were coal fired, and that's where most of the coal from our mines went. If the miners went on strike, nationwide power cuts would follow shortly afterwards.
 - Our manufacturing (which, yes, there used to be a lot of) was famously inefficient, and much of it was state-owned. 
 - The Taiwanese and Japanese (who used to be synonymous with cheap, nasty tat) had really started to sort their quality issues out. Anyone with their finger on the pulse could have easily seen the direction manufacturing was heading in, and was faced with a tough choice: dramatically modernise (i.e. ""automate the living daylights out of everything and make 90% of your staff redundant"") or look for something else to base the economy on. Bear in mind that if you're making 90% of your staff redundant and you're the government, you're going to need something else for them to do anyway - and automating the living daylights out of everything requires an enormous cash investment that the country simply didn't have.

Coal mining is particularly ironic because Thatcher had seen precisely what happened when the miners went on strike. She had decided that there was no way on God's sweet Earth any one industry would have that level of power if she was running the country; she'd been stockpiling coal shortly after she came to power and by the time the miners went on strike in 1984, she had a couple of years' supply warehoused.

Nobody thought to tell Arthur Scargill that. So when he led the miners into a strike, he did so blissfully unaware of the fact that they simply didn't have the same level of power they once did.

For instance, if their policy on removing border controls also brought up the fact that doing so would likely result in huge population growth and would require ripping up tens of thousands of acres of countryside in order to build homes to house everyone then people would maybe be less inclined to vote in favor of the policy.

If their 'protection of all countryside and green areas' policy also mentioned that in order to carry it out we'd have to massively curtail urban expansion and limit efforts to increase supply of social housing people might see that the trade-offs needed to implement such a policy are too great.

If their policy of giving everyone a basic income meant that there wasn't enough money to sustain current expenditure on pensions and the NHS then people might not be so keen on the idea.

If they explained that their policy on reducing 'food miles' and lower our reliance on imported food meant we'd need greater reliance on GMO use on domestic crops then their members might think twice about it.

If it was explained that their policy on banning GMOs would result in us having to import more food from the third world, robbing it from the mouths of the starving people in those countries their members might reconsider it.

---

I'm obviously just making up all these cause/effect scenarios, but the point is that they need to make it clear that certain policies contradict one another and that compromises will have to be made every time a new policy is up for vote.

They need to better explain to their membership that every policy has to be funded somehow and enacting one policy may make another one unsustainable. As mentioned, they need to explain how much each policy will cost and which services will be cut and where the money will be taken from to pay for it.

I think if they better educated their members *how* they plan on implementing their policies rather than just *what* they plan to implement then you'd see them coming up with a much more  pragmatic and realistic set of policies.

If they can show themselves to be realists rather than idealists then they're far more likely to gain a share of the popular vote.

When you start arguing semantics and being a pedant you know your arguments falling flat on it's ass. 

There's a difference between being wealthy, and exorbitantly wealthy. 

50k+ is well off, but not wealthy. You will still be working for the majority of your adult life. Someone who's wealthy, chooses to work because, they have wealth, meaning they don't have a requirement to work.

look at where 961 pw is on this chart

You do realise that graph is for people paying tax via PAYE? Which does not account for self employment, investments, assets, rent and so on? 

You clearly do not have an understanding of how wealth, economics or income work if you think everyone makes their money via PAYE. 

For example, on that graph I'm technically in the bottom 30%, in reality I have wealth that accumulates to just short of 400k. Which is vastly more than the majority of people.

Also Google the company name and suffix it with ""reviews"", that will usually give you some clue. Although in light of the fact that they appear to have only been around for a couple of months you may draw a blank here.

Finally what sort of ongoing relationship will you be having with this company? Are they just matching you to a landlord or will you have some ongoing relationship with them (i.e. paying rent, dealing with repairs etc). In honesty if it were the latter I would probably give that one a miss.

**edit:**

They also publish a company registration number (08472387), a quick search on Companies House reveals that they previously traded as HIGHTOPSEO LTD, assuming search engine optimisation here?

The problem I feel though is that it will seem almost like a break and it would be a bit difficult to start with geography afterwards; disrupting your flow of revision. Perhaps, instead, move the TED Talk to 8-9pm.

But overall, I think that it's a great timetable that you've set out. You might want to add 10-20 minute breaks here and there also. 

Edit - super fucking jealous that you get to do German. My school didn't offer it, so I've been teaching it myself in my free time. ;) ",null,0,null,1425217148,null,0,false,0,cp0shyu,null,t3_2xjwef,null,t1_cp0shyu,null,t3_2xjwef,null,null,null,1427517790,null,2,false,GCSE,t5_2u3gk,2,null

We need to completely change the defensive system because his does not work, simple as. 

Kompany, Mangala and Zabaleta all had great moments today when they were faced with 1 on 1 situations. They are still brilliant defenders. Kompany hasn't turned to shit over the last 18 months, there was a reason we paid so much for Mangala. 

But the system is broken. The players can't defend as a back four,  they were a complete joke in both games this week and if we are going to challenge for trophies it needs to change. 

And it's pulling the defensive midfielders into emergency defence and that means the attack won't work when we actually get the ball back. We had __one shot on target all game__. Embarrassing.

Then there's our problem at the back. Kompany and now Zaba are terribly out of form and there isn't anyone to really cover for them. Hopefully Mangala can really reach his potential and not be given up on after a year like Nastisic was. At this point it's ""scheme over team"" defensively. Playing a high line isn't working? Well don't play a high line. Sit back, if you keep everyone in front of you and the midfielders actually work to get the ball back it'll be hard to score. It pisses me off when I see a team with so much potential giving anything less than 100%.

*Marc Rich was an international israeli-american-swiss-bolivian-spanish hedge fund manager worth several billion dollars. He was indicted in the United States on 65 criminal counts, including income tax evasion, wire fraud, racketeering, and trading with Iran during the oil embargo. The charges would have led to a sentence of more than 300 years in prison had Rich been convicted on all counts.  At the time it was the biggest tax evasion case in the United States history. Hours before leaving office, U.S. President Bill Clinton granted Rich a presidential pardon after the billionaire gave money to Hillary Clinton*

null,false,BendyZebra,null,null,null,"Nah, it's cool, I'm not surprised you can't figure it out from so little info. It's considered a ""rare"" disorder anyway (most likely just massively underdiagnosed though!) and I didn't give away any of symptoms that would maybe jump out at you.

As the Prof. that diagnosed me put it, I have ""severe, multi-systemic, mixed-type Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome."" I have classical, hypermobile and vascular types and I'm pretty messed up these days. I use a powered wheelchair and ceiling hoists to get around without falling apart.

Even now when I go to A&amp;E the first question is usually ""what's Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome?"" and the few that have heard of it have no idea that there are so many types and that it can be as severe as this. I tend to find a lot of Doctor's will just take my lead as I'm classed as a ""Patient Expert"". It can be a little scary when I'm ill and have to tell everyone else what to do.

I suffer 30+ dislocations a day (including spinal ones and ribs) and even more subluxations, I've given up counting those. I don't go to the hospital for that though as the standard method for reducing a dislocation (pull!) is dangerous to me, my tendons and ligaments will snap or come away the bone. I have to manipulate them gently back into place and can mostly do them myself (or with help from my husband). Still really bloody painful though!

I have the J-tube as I have almost complete digestive tract paralysis, starting with dysphagia and going right the way through to having extremely slow, stretchy bowels that refuse to absorb most of what I take in, even with a specialist feed designed for Crohn's/IBD patients that have lost most of their small intestine. 

They're not sure why the gastroparesis started, the main suspects are the kyphoscoliosis, as C5&amp;6 decided to collapse onto my spinal cord and compress it by just under 50%, or possibly the autonomic dysfunction (I suffer with low blood pressure, orthostatic intolerance causing tachy/bradycardia, I can't control my body temp or breathing normally etc... Having digestive issues could easily be down to that!)

I have a whole bunch of crazy internal issues relating to the lack of collagen and cartilage. I'm a bit overwhelming to my local hospital and have to go to London for anything major. My heart is weak and I have issues with MVP but it's not too bad for now.

Sorry to hear about the heart block! Type 1, 2 or 3? I'm assuming it's not Type 3 as you say it's relatively mild. Glad you're doing okay with it though. I get palpitations and it feels awful, you have my sympathy!

I totally agree that everyone should see just how much they're costing each time they go to the hospital, especially if it's for something that should have been seen by a GP.

It's awful how badly medical staff are treated these days. Yes, you guys make mistakes, everyone does though, you're not infallable but you still deserve respect. I'm actually terrified of Doctors as due to my condition I've been on the receiving side of a few too many mistakes over the years. That's just because of the lack of knowledge about EDS though. I had one side of my ribcage collapsed and an artery in my wrist burst in one day because of a Doctor that didn't want to admit that he didn't know anything about EDS. 

He refused to listen to me when I told him what would happen and funnily enough, it went exactly as I expected. That kind of Doctor does make me angry as I *have* to know every detail about what is and isn't safe to do to me or I'd be dead by now. He put me at massive risk because he refused to accept that in my situation, I may actually, genuinely know more than him because I live with this every day!

Most Doctor's are really good at holding their hands up and saying ""I don't have a clue, I'll let you guide me"". I trust a Doctor that admits to what he doesn't know far more than I trust one that tries to fake it.

I really do genuinely appreciate good Doctors though and I can even forgive the ""bad"" ones as it's a tough job and I'm a challenging case to handle.

Most of the nurses and Doctor's know me now as I'm often on the same few wards. I get greeted with hugs and ""oh no, what's wrong this time, Trouble?!"" when they see me. I also get ""so where are our sweets then?!"" with a wink and a cheeky grin. 

I regularly play little pranks on the ones I know well and they prank me back. It's nice to cheer them up, whether with coffee, sweets or jokes. 

Gonna have to go find the BMJ study on chocolates for staff now! I've got to read that.

null,false,shabouwcaw,lfc99,,null,"Allen was excellent today, kept everything to one or two touches which really injected pace into the game, kept the tempo high. He was also very tidy in defence and covered well. 9/10


Coutinho was excellent and the focal point of the attack. If we can keep him from getting fatigued he could be our most important player for the run in. Great turns to make space and looked lethal running at the city defence. 9/10


Sterling was excellent in his false 9 position, he seems to be growing more confident in that role, it's really improving his all round game. His decision making is getting better but he needs more of a killer instinct, his finishing is still very reminiscent of a winger player up front, taking too many touches, trying to walk it in. 8/10


Henderson was immense, really great work ethic, fantastic strike, some incredible pressing at the end. A really good, leading by example captain's performance. 8/10


Lallana had some great touches and operated really well as an outlet. made a number of very unselfish runs to make space. Good performance from him. He was unlucky not to bag a goal. 7/10


Skrtel was great in his free defender/middle defender role. Drifted well to cover some vital challenges. 7/10

Moreno was excellent at times but I think tiredness caught up with him. He made some incredible 60 yard runs and beat players really well in the first half and was tidy in the second. however, I think he's too young to play nearly 2 hours of football in 4 days. faded a bit towards the end. 7/10


Can was fine, bit more quiet than he has been of late but I think he was limited because Markovic was struggling a bit and that impacted how much time he had on the ball and what outlets he could choose. he has played a lot lately. 6/10

Markovic struggled a bit at times, lacked composure. He showed flashes of excellence though and once he's more consistent will be an excellent player. 5/10

Lovren was appalling in the first half, drifted a bit and left too much space in behind him. Was mostly at fault for the goal, making the poor clearance that set it up and not blocking the space in behind.  Passing was terrible in the first half. Steadied the ship to an extent in the second half but he also had more time on the ball. Promising signs that he might not be a complete write off, but he's a very very poor player so far and I think a lot of the praise he gets is due to how bad he has been and the fact that people want him to play well and give him the benefit of the doubt. 5/10

Mignolet didn't have much to do, looked a bit shaky at times, but a generally good game. not much he could do about the goal. No rating for him, he didn't have much impact.

A very very good performance but we were aided by the fact that City neglected the central midfield zone in front of defence and gave us a lot of time and space to play the ball. Combined with a very dodgy performance from Vincent Kompany we were able to overload the centre of the pitch with ease and create 1 on 1s in the wide areas. However, due to a lack of height and quality we didn't turn those overloads into that many clear cut chances, something we will need to improve upon. 


You can really see the difference Coutinho and Henderson make, a lot more energy and creativity in central areas when they're playing. I was hoping the Besiktas result was an aberration due to the fact that it was a makeshift midfield and defence, and with the formation and team today more like the settled one we are used to, that seems to be the case.

While I did give Markovic and Moreno low-ish ratings we should also credit them with the fact that they did manage to pin the City full-backs back very well, limiting what is a potent attacking outlet for the Mancs. 

I will probably get a lot of hate for being harsh on Lovren but I do believe that having Sakho back will shore up a lot of defensive problems as well as introducing more verticality into our attacks, since Sakho is an incredibly incisive on-the-ground passer. If Lovren is to succeed it might be to play in the free defender role that Skrtel currently sits in. What I mean by that is - there were two forwards today, one generally marked by Lovren (Dzeko) and one marked by Can (Aguero). Skrtels role is to float and cover in case the striker beats the primary defender. He's also holding a floating role to attack balls over the top and cut out crosses. Since Skrtel is a great reactive defender, he's perfect for the role. Lovren might also thrive in the simplified game that that role represents. He seems to struggle when complicated decisions have to be made or pressure (in the form of pressing) comes. 

In terms of attack, we did have some good passages of play nullified by offsides, something that perhaps gives some hope in terms of our ability to create chances, but it is concerning that we won by two wonder strikes from outside the area, as those are not something we can rely on every week. We do need to be more lethal from within the box, whether that is creating more clear cut chances or by improving finishing. We seem to have a number of players that find it difficult to find the corners of the net, we probably hit more balls directly at keepers than any other side, but I'll defer to anyone who has stats on that.

All in all, a fantastic result and performance, it sets us up nicely for a push for the top four. Burnley next week is a different kind of challenge and I hope Sakho is back, in tandem with Sturridge being in a position to start, so that we can have a bit more directness and guile in around the box.

My reasons NOT to vote for them would be that their ideas are not actually applicable to the real world that we live in.

He's doing well though, the best he's played in years, but that's largely down to the partnership with Can and Sakho, et al. My criticism has long been that he's a reactive rather than a proactive defender, the kind who's best sitting back rather than stopping attacks early like our team needs. Thing is, with Can and Sakho playing that more aggressive defensive role, it frees up Skrtel to do all the things he does best - win it in the air, intercept long balls, cover when a player gets through, etc. He's excelling in a specialised role, rather than excelling as an all-round defender. Both his partners in that first-choice back-3 are doing better, in my opinion. The argument could definitely be made that SAKHO is playing as well as any other defender in the league - last 2 matches excepted, obviously - but Skrtel still falls short of that mark by some way.",null,0,null,1425223516,null,0,false,0,cp0uk9p,null,t3_2xkaph,null,t1_cp0uk9p,null,t3_2xkaph,null,null,null,1427518753,null,9,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,9,null

I went via Birmingham-Dublin flight (I used Aer Lingus), which is only 40 minutes in the air. Don't buy a drink on the flight, they'll swipe it from you before you get a chance to finish it!

Birmingham airport is a good option normally - I find that is a much more pleasant experience than Heathrow because of the lack of crowds and other flights. If you miss your flight slot at Heathrow you sit on the tarmac for half an hour which is a pain on a 1-hour flight. If you do go to Heathrow, there is the [X90 bus](http://x90.oxfordbus.co.uk/timetables-fares/) which is direct and takes about 100 mins, most locals feel that this is a better option than the multiples trains. (Also cheaper).

The Birmingham train service is normally quick and efficient - the train station is directly linked to the airport departures by a shuttle service (not actually a monorail, but that's the idea) and if you have checked-in on the net you walk off the shuttle and straight into security. 

However, as /u/Sasakura says, there has been a landslip which will mean you break the train journey to Birmingham and there are dedicated buses laid on for you to get past the problem (between Banbury and Leamington Spa). This works efficiently but the journey time is currently 2 hours instead of the normal 1 hour. Check [here](http://www.crosscountrytrains.co.uk/travel-updates/all-travel-updates/disruption-between-leamington-spa-and-banbury) for the latest updates to the service.

Tip of the iceberg. 

The [Vestey family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestey_Group) of shipping magnates and food producers and once one of Britain's richest business dynasties didn't pay any tax for over 100 years until 1991 ( and it's still disputed as to whether they do today ) *you may remember one of their offshoots Dewhurst the butchers*

They were one of the originators of this whole system of tax avoidance. They lobbied hard against the system of cross border tax jurisdictions and law and a lot of what they did is now common place for corporations around the world i.e. you pay minimal or no tax in the lowest common denominator countries or Tax havens for business you do in the richest ones via a complex system of accounting and trusts. 

They even have their own [peerage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Vestey,_1st_Baron_Vestey) for their troubles.

Or, the age could change to 60.  Or 75.  The maximum pension value could be reduced, the tax free lump sump could be abolished.

Or your pension scheme could lose a significant amount of its value.

You really don't know what will happen in 40 years.

Paying in 9% and getting an extra 13% is a damned good deal - you're doubling your money and getting a little extra.  That should help if your pension investment takes a tumble.

On topic though: I'm upset. 

EDIT (now that I've calmed down): This was a massive game for us in terms of our position in the league and how we plan to see the last games run out, and we did not step up at all. Jags and Coleman seemed to be the only ones who cared that we were losing. You could see Jags' frustration when he ended up bombing out of defence on his own just to try get the game going. 

This side to side passing is absolute bullshit and the worst thing is it's showing no sign of stopping. It's no surprise we're calling for Gibson to start; he's the only one playing the fucking ball forward, but playing Gibson isn't the answer. The other players playing like Gibson is the answer. It's not like he's the only one that can pick out a forward pass. The rest of the lads need to learn from him. 
 
I want to see some sort of fire in the team. I want to see them show that they want to play for this club, that they at least give a flying fuck about getting a win in the league. It's embarrassing and they don't seem to care.

Honestly, do we do anything on the training pitch other than pass the ball five yards sideways and boost Rom's ego?

No movement yet again in the opposition half; no third man runners AT ALL; no discernible set piece tactics, attacking or more importantly defensively; no pace in any of our attacks; it's all just shit. 

We came to disrupt Arsenal's play and win the ball back quick, great but it all goes to shit if you can't defend set-pieces or even look interested on the counter.

The small positives were Coleman and Garbutt but when they got the ball forward they had no options. Just a lazy fucker up front who thinks he's untouchable.

We came to disrupt Arsenal's play and win the ball back quick, great but it all goes to shit if you can't defend set-pieces or even look interested on the counter.

Why in every league game I expect things to be different although everything going in is the same. That's the literal definition of insanity. We just aren't good enough and I think it's time we all see that especially the manager. If we didn't have Europa League there's no doubt in my mind that Roberto would be gone and honestly I would want him gone if we didn't have it because this season has been farcical in everything but Europe. 

As for the players I can maybe say Garbutt and Lukaku had good games with what they were given. The only passes it seems Garbutt was getting was from Jags and half of them went out of play while as usual with Rom he had to make most of the chances himself. Everyone else however, just not good enough. McCarthy was very poor in my opinion as was Stones. Lennon wasn't allowed to get into the game due to no passes after coming on for Mirallas who didn't even look bothered even though he was playing against one of the teams he probably wants to sign for. Coleman was alright but didn't do too much, still a shadow of himself from last season. Barkley really just isn't good enough and he needs to improve vastly I mean he's had 1 assist in 60 league games, that's shocking! Naismith as well is just a unneeded sub really because he's not an impact player. Suits him much better to start really. 

I look at the table and I look at how we perform and I just don't see where we are going to get the points to guarantee safety from? I don't think we are gonna get relegated but if you think there's no chance of it then I'm sorry you're an idiot. The only reason we won't go down isn't due to us playing well it'll be due to other teams somehow playing worse.

Johnson, as per usual, was impeccable - whatever doubts may surround his ability as a Premier League player, there's no question that he's absolutely unreal in the Championship. He was all over the pitch and has really found his feet this season. Defending was also pretty much on point. It's obvious Bassong has brought some much needed stability into the backline and hopefully can continue to do so without any of the dressing room issues arising again.

In December 2013 Mario Husillos came back to the club and Esparraga had part of his power to make decisions revoked. The reason Esparraga ended up leaving the club at the end of the season wasn't made public, but it looked like it had something to do with this.

What I can tell about him is that he doesn't have any professional playing experience, he relies heavily on scouting databases and has his own company that provides scouting courses. He has published a book about tactics and has a UEFA Pro Coaching Licence. He looks good on paper and he paints a pretty picture of himself.

That being said, maybe he was just unlucky and has learned something about his experience at Málaga...

Baines ( and coleman) has played poorly because we persist on playing 1 winger (no one is there to assist him on the wing/ there is no winger at all, + the fact the amount of open space on the wings that have been ignored this year, which has caused Coleman and Baines to play less higher up the pitch it would seem and just be crowded out by defenders  when they do venture up the pitch.

Barkley-&gt; Never really been great tbh, gives the ball away a lot, looks like a Championship player and is slow. Did well last season because we were playing well; this season he is showing his weaknesses, slowness, general 'can't be arsed ness' and the fact he just gives the ball away. (NEver been a fan, I accept downvotes because of this bit :) )

Lukaku-&gt; Don't play to his strengths and no crosses coming in as often (see baines section).

Howard-&gt; Not playing poorly as such but the defence isn't helping, poor marking and closing down + passing it on the edgte of the box is asking for a mistake (seen many this season as well as last).

We just aren't good enough and I think it's time we all see that especially the manager. If we didn't have Europa League there's no doubt in my mind that Roberto would be gone and honestly I would want him gone if we didn't have it because this season has been farcical in everything but Europe.

As for the players I can maybe say Garbutt and Lukaku had good games with what they were given. The only passes it seems Garbutt was getting was from Jags and half of them went out of play while as usual with Rom he had to make most of the chances himself. Everyone else however, just not good enough. McCarthy was very poor in my opinion as was Stones. Lennon wasn't allowed to get into the game due to no passes after coming on for Mirallas who didn't even look bothered even though he was playing against one of the teams he probably wants to sign for. Coleman was alright but didn't do too much, still a shadow of himself from last season. Barkley really just isn't good enough and he needs to improve vastly I mean he's had 1 assist in 60 league games, that's shocking! Naismith as well is just a unneeded sub really because he's not an impact player. Suits him much better to start really.

I look at the table and I look at how we perform and I just don't see where we are going to get the points to guarantee safety from? I don't think we are gonna get relegated but if you think there's no chance of it then I'm sorry you're an idiot. The only reason we won't go down isn't due to us playing well it'll be due to other teams somehow playing worse.

I used Match 16 (against Man U) as the basis for our ""turning point."" 1.4 PPG up to and including Sunderland; 2.25 PPG since. If we only count matches since Boxing Day, our PPG jumps to 2.6 - which is league-winning form.

If we crunch some really basic numbers:  

(1.78 pgg overall)*(11 games reamining) + (48 points so far) = 67.58 points

(2.25 ppg)*(11 games remaining)+(48 points so far) = 72.75 points

(2.6 pgg)*(11 games remaining) + (48 points so far) = 76.6 points

We're not doing too badly so far, especially based on the conservative estimates presented in [this](http://microlfc.com/2015/01/04/liverpool-wont-finish-in-the-top-4-this-season-its-time-to-adjust-your-expectations-prioritise-cup-competitions)  article from a few months back.

Edit: To go further -
Arsenal last year finished with 79 points at 2.09 PPG.
If we want to equal that total with the remaining 11 matches, we need to hit an average of 2.81 PPG in the remaining games, which is massive (10W-1D-0L *or better*). That said, the important thing to take away from this information is that top 4 chances are in our hands.

We have yet to play against Arsenal and Man U (our top 4 rivals) at this stage. Ceteris paribus, a win over Man U brings us 1 point beyond Man U and a top 4 spot.

Man U's PPG since their match against us in December is 1.72 PPG. This leaves them at 68.92 points by the end of the season, compared to our 72.75.

Anyway. Just gonna leave that here.

If people do fall into drug addiction I want it treated as a medical problem, ensure addicts have access to pure drugs and medical help for their addiction. I believe the harms of these pure drugs to the individual are too high to allow anybody and everybody to buy them. 

The BMA have suggested a similar model, with multiple tiers of regulations for different drugs depending on the potential harm of each drug (actual harm as well, not arbitrary Class values we have at the moment). For instance high risk drugs such as heroin or meth would only be allowed to be sold and used by addicts in a clinical setting, drugs like powder coke, amphetamines, and interestingly mdma would be legal for everyone but only allowed to be dispensed by specifically trained and highly regulated pharmacists-you couldn't buy it in tescos. Certain drugs would be available for sale over the counter like fags and booze atm whilst others like cannabis could be treated like it is in Amsterdam with weed cafes (as well as on sale from licensed supermarkets the same as booze). 

On top of all this there would be similar rules that are being enforced of tobacco companies. No advertising, huge health warnings everywhere and very heavy regulation for manufacturers. The BMA specifically state that the historically unregulated alcohol and tobacco industries can be used as models of how not to treat drug sales regulations.

This was a massive game for us in terms of our position in the league and how we plan to see the last games run out, and we did not step up at all. Jags and Coleman seemed to be the only ones who cared that we were losing. You could see Jags' frustration when he ended up bombing out of defence on his own just to try get the game going. 

This side to side passing is absolute bullshit and the worst thing is it's showing no sign of stopping. It's no surprise we're calling for Gibson to start; he's the only one playing the fucking ball forward, but playing Gibson isn't the answer. The other players playing like Gibson is the answer. It's not like he's the only one that can pick out a forward pass. The rest of the lads need to learn from him.

Pellegrini evidently realised this issue and tried to address it by buying Fernando - who just hasn't lived up to what was expected by any of us.

I see people here making the point about Kompany diving into challenges aggressively and blaming this is Pellegrini's tactics - I really don't get this. Him and Zabaleta both have always had the same aggressive style playing for City as they do now, the only difference is that they're making *a lot* more mistakes lately. Why are we not finding ourselves accusing Demi, Clichy, Kolarov of diving into tackles if this is a tactics issue? 

As for the 442, it's fair enough to question it. Though my view is that the difference is whether Milner starts or not, because if he doesn't then we are left with a toothless midfield defensively, no matter what the formation.

Then when we needed to push for an equalizer, we take off a winger for another winger. What good is having 3 DM's on the field when we are pushing for an equalizer?! The DM's were not having great off the ball movement, nor were they making good use of the possession. Barring Barry's occasional hopeful chip over the top, they barely advanced the ball. 

Our set pieces are poor both attacking and defending. I don't think we have scored one goal off a corner this season at all. 


With 6 points off relegation zone and 6 wins in 26 games, relegation is a scary yet real possibility. I don't think we will get relegated in the end but do we want risk it? 

Last year was great. It was beautiful. Martinez might have improved our possession but he doesn't have a Plan B. He's been figured out and he's too stubborn to change. 


At this point, I think we need someone who is more pragmatic and someone who can hold the players accountable. Roberto is neither.

&gt;The charts below show the way in which the [International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) represents [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language) pronunciations in Wikipedia articles.

&gt;English approximations are in some cases very rough, and only intended to give a general idea of the pronunciation. See [French phonology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_phonology) for a more thorough look at the sounds.

&gt;French has no word-level [stress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(linguistics\)), so stress marks should not be used in transcribing French words. See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_phonology#Stress) for explanation.

This. I feel like Martinez is too nice sometimes. If his press conferences are anything to go by he mollycoddles the players. When they play bad he is probably the first one to console them.

In 2012-13, Lawro had us relegated AGAIN! But this time finishing in 18th place. He was wrong by 9 places, 16pts and 21 goals.

http://www.myfootballfacts.com/Mark_Lawrensons_Predictions_2012-13.html

---

Finally, in 2013-14 Lawro finally gets something right. Predicting Swansea would finish in 12th place (spot on) but 1pt and 15 goals out.
Bonus: He also predicted correctly that Cardiff would finish rock bottom in 20th place, but was 16pts and 6 goals out.

http://www.myfootballfacts.com/Mark_Lawrenson_Predictions_2013-14.html

---

So far this season 2014-15, Lawro is back on old form. Having Swansea deep in a relegation battle ~ 19th! As it stands he's 11 places, 21pts and 20 goals out.

http://www.myfootballfacts.com/Mark_Lawrenson_Predictions_2014-15.html

---

On average Lawro has us wrong by: 7 places, 14.5pts and 20.25 goals.

---

I have vague memories of Lawro commenting on us on MOTD (or Football Focus) in our first season in the Premier League: basically he said that he was certain of us being relegated that season, believing that our small size and lack of resources/finances/squad size would make us unable to compete 'with the big boys'. After 4 years I don't think he's really changed that opinion.

Hmm that sounds very familiar, ah yes, just like every historical example of a Fascist government.

Christopher Hitchens made the following comparison:

""The most obvious points of comparison would be these: Both movements are based on a cult of murderous violence that exalts death and destruction and despises the life of the mind. (""Death to the intellect! Long live death!"" as Gen. Francisco Franco's sidekick Millán Astray so pithily phrased it.) Both are hostile to modernity (except when it comes to the pursuit of weapons), and both are bitterly nostalgic for past empires and lost glories. Both are obsessed with real and imagined ""humiliations"" and thirsty for revenge. Both are chronically infected with the toxin of anti-Jewish paranoia (interestingly, also, with its milder cousin, anti-Freemason paranoia). Both are inclined to leader worship and to the exclusive stress on the power of one great book. Both have a strong commitment to sexual repression—especially to the repression of any sexual ""deviance""—and to its counterparts the subordination of the female and contempt for the feminine. Both despise art and literature as symptoms of degeneracy and decadence; both burn books and destroy museums and treasures.""

null,false,layendecker,crest-new,OLD CREST 4EVA,null,"&gt; Some games are very winnable on paper, just like Leicester.  

Even if we draw 2 of those bottom 4, that is 8 points, which puts on 36- which is probably only off a point or two what we need to be safe. That Leicester result was a freak one as well, we play that game 100 times, we lose maybe 10 of them. We dominated, and were stunned by individual errors (not just 1, more like 6)- whilst that stuff will happen, and we will drop points (especially if Howard keeps his place), they are going to be an exception rather than a rule. 

West Ham is winnable because they are injury stricken, and in worse form than even us. Stoke is winnable because they are a highly unpredictable, and with (by far) their most influential player out injured, in addition to their starting LB, they are going to have a lot of trouble at the back. 

We have a good team, we are playing better than pretty much all the teams below us, we have easier fixtures than pretty much all teams below us and we have shown that we can mix it with anyone they can put in front of us if we turn up.

null,false,basketballhater,newcr-1,Besic's new Lambo,null,"This is going to a bit of a rant so stick with me for a bit.

First of all, even though relegation is a real possibility, I don't think we'll be going down.  We have too much talent to be considered a part of the bottom 3, especially because Leicester, Villa, and Burnley are so bad.  It's going to go down right till the end, though and, if anything it's going to make for a tense, exciting season for all the wrong reasons.

Having said that, I am very disappointed with how this team have performed this season.  Like I said before, we have a lot of talent, and we should never have been in this position.  I've said it before and I'll say it again, Europa is a curse.  I haven't seen a single team that manages to stay in Europa perform well in the league.  They always end up somewhere in the bottom half.  

Now that I've established that, I'm going to say that I don't like how Martinez has handled the team this season.  When we first signed him, I had enormous doubts about his ability because he had just managed to get Wigan relegated and now he was coming to us.  As the season went on though, he made a believer out me me, so to speak, and I have defended him for most of this season, but I can't keep doing that anymore.  I don't like how he tries to brush all issues under the table, at least publicly, and plays the same players again and again even when they don't perform.  I get that he's trying to boost their confidence and show that he believes in them, but that can only go so far.  If the player doesn't perform, then bench him, and make him earn a place back in the squad.  Competition, as we all know, is the key to having the strongest squad.  Another gripe I have with him is his unwillingness to rotate the squad.  Yes, I realize that he's had to deal with injuries this season, but I'm thinking more along the lines of how we put basically our strongest 11 out against the 2nd leg of Young Boys.  Lukaku should have been given a rest, so should have Naismith, and Mirallas.  In my mind, Osman should have started that game, even though he was just coming back from injury, and then been subbed off.  We should have started Kone as well, along with some youngsters, just to give them some match time.  We won the game dramatically, but it wasn't worth it, especially when it comes at the cost of league games.  In short, I think he should go unless he gives us Europa this season.  I'm not basing this off the fact that we've had bad results this season, rather off the fact that he is unwilling to compromise and unwilling to change his strategy to win games.  He loves possession, but possession is nothing if you can't score goals.  All passing around midfield does is make is easy for the opposition to capitalize on a bad pass.  You need to have an end product at the end of all the play and I think we have been seriously lacking in that department this year.  Teams have figured out how we play and Martinez is unwilling to adapt to the changing situation to get results

Moving on to the last point I'm going rant about, I think that unless we win Europa, we're going to be losing some key players this summer.  I'm mainly thinking of Mirallas (honestly we all knew he was leaving anyway), Coleman, and McCarthy.  These players want to play at the very top level and they haven't shown anything in the way of moving loyalty towards the club, so I can very easily see them leaving this summer.  All I can hope for is that we get a fair price for them and that we can reinvest wisely.  If Southhampton can lose most of their key players and still be in contention for the top 4, then why can't we?  When we do rebuild, though, unless the aforementioned situation happens, I think the responsibility should fall to someone else, not Martinez.

Sorry this was so long and drawn out, but I just wanted to get all my thoughts across here.

**TL;DR:  No, I don't think we're going to get relegated this year.  No I don't think that that is good enough.  No, I don't think Martinez should be our manager next year (unless we in Europa).  Yes, I think we're going to be losing some key players this summer.**",null,0,null,1425230741,null,0,false,0,cp0xwmc,null,t3_2xkhuu,null,t1_cp0xwmc,null,t3_2xkhuu,null,null,null,1427520702,null,12,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,12,null

Because there can never be agreement.  There will *always* be differences in opinion.

People seem to forget how good Arsenal are, they have £120m+ quid in midfield, and a bench that every player would walk into pretty much any PL team not in the top 4:

01 Szczesny       
04 Mertesacker          
07 Rosicky         
14 Walcott          
18 Monreal          
21 Chambers          
23 Welbeck          

That is what we were up against, and this is what we have there:

01 Robles          
04 Gibson          
09 Koné         
14 Naismith         
21 Osman           
25 Lennon          
30 Alcaraz           

A bench we paid, in total about 10m for.

This is the depth we have, and they are (with no disrespect) nowhere near the class Arsenal have and (as you very astutely point out) Arsenal, with their tens of millions of pounds of depth had an extra day to prepare. 

I get being optimistic, but it was always going to be a long and hard day for us. 

We have overachieved in the past, and managed to fight a point out of the Emirates on a number of occasions- but that is exactly what we were doing: overachieving. Yes, we are running below expectation this season, but it is not like Martinez has taken a top 4 side on paper, and dragged us down into the bottom half. 

We are hardly even [a top 10 side in terms of spend](http://www.tsmplug.com/football/premier-league-player-salaries-club-by-club/), so we cannot judge Martinez in comparison to a season where he blew away all expectations.

null,false,windsorlad111,null,null,null,"""The Liquidator"" is an early reggae instrumental released in the United Kingdom by the Harry J Allstars in 1969. Its association with Chelsea dates from this time, when contemporary chart hits were regularly played at the ground, and it proved popular with the fans. In recent years it has been reintroduced as the tune that the teams run out to at Stamford Bridge. The tune is also popular with fans of West Bromwich Albion, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Wycombe Wanderers.
Having been played at Chelsea in the late 1960s shortly after the tune began to be played in London clubs, it has been an ""official"" Chelsea song since 1970, when the matchday programme gave away copies as competition prizes.


""Way back in 1969, supporters of the Chelsea football team revered players such as Bonetti, Osgood and Hollins. The boys performed under the watchful eye of manager Dave Sexton to the tune of Harry J &amp; All Stars chartbuster, 'The Liquidator'. Whether the tune helped the squad in their successful 1970 FA Cup campaign and subsequent Cup Winners Cup victory we shall never know. One thing is certain the theme to those victories was undoubtedly 'The Liquidator', with its Hammond organ crescendos that lead to the chant of ""CHEL-SEA!"".""

- Liner notes in ""Liquidator - The Best of the Harry J All Stars"".
There is crowd participation at regular intervals during the tune with four claps and a shout of ""Chelsea!"" repeated:

Many people struggle to make enough money to survive on, job centres try to push the unemployed into whatever rotten, low-paid jobs are available. If prostitution comes to be seen as a legitimate 'job', then might there not be pressure on those in dire financial straits to become prostitutes (to a greater extent than there is already)? It becomes just one more job that they're turning down in order to get social welfare; if they don't want to take this perfectly legitimate work, why should they be entitled to public money? Already, in this thread there are comments to the effect that selling your body is a job like any other. I don't think this is really an attitude we would really want to foster.

I think that's an argument that's used against the legalisation of selling organs, too: if it becomes a legitimate way of making money, then the poor might be expected to do it; if they choose to keep a kidney over a few thousand pounds, why should they then be entitled to other people's money?",null,0,null,1425231806,null,0,1425237388,0,cp0ygax,null,t3_2xibfm,null,t1_cp0ygax,null,t1_cp0f0h7,null,null,null,1427520957,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

People seem to forget that we absolutely blasted expectations, playing wonderful football. 

This year there has been a clear fitness issue, and an issue with European hangovers- but this is a highly competitive league with a staff that is relatively inexperienced in the challenge that has been presented to us this year.  

We have seen huge development this year, both from individuals (Besic, Stones, Naismith and Lukaku especially) and even as a team. Whilst it doesn't click all the time, we have shown that we have the ability to really mix up tempo over the last 6 weeks or so. 

Next year, without those nightmare Thursdays- and a number of new players in the side, I feel we will once again be back as a comfortable top half side. 

Whilst I may be wrong, I see a hell of a lot of positives within our play. Whilst we are doing some things poorly, and are perhaps putting too much emphasis on developing youth (playing Barkley and Lukaku week in week our for one), I think it is a strategy that will pay off in years to come.

null,false,ZombieWomble,null,null,null,"&gt; The Barnett formula dictates the budget for Stormont and that is spent on a big chunk of our public sector, but we have extra public sector jobs on top that are paid for straight out of the treasury, bypassing the Stormont budget, so we actually get a double subsidy.

Do you have any details on this? I was under the impression that pretty much all public spending in NI was devolved through Stormont now. In what areas do Westminster still employ a large number of people directly (obvious cases of military spending aside)?

More generally, the Barnett formula technically only governs *changes* in budgets, not the actual budget value. When people say 'Scrap the Barnett Formula', what they usually actually mean is 'Scrap the formula and massively cut regional spending'.

I don't think we played terrible, but we just didn't get enough going forward to create good chances. Apart from the free kick, I can remember Eriksen trying to sneak one on the inside of Cech but thats about it. I'm not too knowledgeable about the ins and outs of the game, but I know from watching that I felt like Chelsea just stopped us getting anything going rather than us playing bad, and they didn't give us the chance to fluke our way to a late minute goal/equaliser. 

I'm proud we got the the final, but Chelsea played better and deserved it. This is only the beginning for Pochettino's Spurs, we can at the very least say we are no longer the team of the last few seasons to absolutely shit ourselves at the sight of a top 4 team, and until about the 85th minute I was honestly still on the edge of my seat thinking we were still in it.

'Quite a few real ales do not have any wheat in their ingredients. Beers identified as wheat beers will have a large quantity of wheat (malted and unmalted) in their ingredients - up to 50% or even more. Geuezes and lambic beers also have a considerable proportion of wheat in their make up. 

But even beers which would not normally be considered as being wheat beers sometimes have a small proportion of wheat in the original grist to help such things as head retention. There may be only 5% or less but this is sometimes enough to give an allergic reaction to someone who is intolerant or alergic to wheat. 

However since beer doesn't have to have its ingredients listed it may be difficult to identify those beers that are wheat free. 

Woodforde's regular beers have no wheat. 

Adnams beers use no wheat. 

Timothy Taylors Landlord is wheat free.'

In fact, there isn't a team in all of Europe that can claim to overwhelm us in terms of skill. When you have that kind of mindset though it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy and teams take advantage. Coming into the 2nd half today we looked like we wanted to play for a draw, which is unacceptable when you are chasing in the title hunt and are playing a team 2 days off playing 120 minutes.

Can't you withdraw from the ISA? That's weird... most ISAs you can make withdrawals from at any time, only downside is you've used up a bit of your allowance.

edit: also, if you're not a taxpayer (eg unemployed or your earnings are below the tax threshold) remember to mention this to the bank so that they will pay you the gross rate not net for the regular saver. (ISAs are all gross anyway of course).

Edit2: sounds like you have a few different possible paths - why not book an appointment to talk to someone, either at your bank, or an independent financial advisor. I'd ask your bank first to see what products they have that meet your needs, but an IFA might have some better options too. It's worth being serious about this sort of thing.

edit3: nationwide's standard regular saver offers something like 2-2.5% as well, so have a look at that too. I'm sure most banks have good options as well, which is why I suggest talking to your bank first.

I really think, we (many who would describe themselves as liberal or (not necessarily the same thing, I dont consider my self the next one at all) or on the 'left) need stop pretending that wahhabism aggressively funded by Saudi money is not a extremely aggressive and proselyting ideology throughout our education system. 

No it doesn't advocate blowing up people, but its world view is about as far from political pluralism as it can get. And the radical wing (read kids) involved in this ideology are rarely very far away from salafism. Which of course with its millenarian trappings finds no sin too great in so holy a cause. 

This has been a big debate in political philosophy for a while. Value neutral liberalism seems to fail in accepting that people should have the right to advocate ideological standpoints that call for the destruction of the very field of discourse they reside in so long as they are not openly racist or sexist and even then, points for not being the traditional problem ideologies of western societies. 

That is to say, good people and motivated by fairly humanist consecrations to have some serious blind spots to people they consider the 'underdogs'. When they really might be some very well funded and organised demagogues allowing some dangerous rot to take root. 

I guess my point is this, wahhabism is openly opposed to free speech, how far does the 'well we have to be better than them' argument really advance with an ideology that wants to destroy pluralistic discourse?

Given all that, I think the reaction against him was blown out of proportion, people talking about selling him and the like. We have a new system now that helps all our central defenders to look better than they were doing. He has a better chance to settle in now, the responsibility that was shared by 2 CBs is now shared by 3, the cover from midfield has improved, Skrtel is great in that central role, Mignolet looks more comfortable and confident, we don't hold the ball so much at the back anymore. 

Rodgers sensibly protected Lovren until recently and the problem may have been more a psychological one than a performance one, similar to Migs in a way. I think he'll improve and Rodgers obviously trusts him to come in and maybe he'll take that place off Can in time. As long as the team as a whole is playing better then the heat is off to some extent, which should help him.

null,false,nssmuckers,num5-away,,null,"Thought we were fine, but I also think we have real issues in attack. I just don't think we have enough quality or penetration in attacking midfield right now. 

Eriksen is having a rough patch of form and he's not a particularly incisive passer even when he's on form. Chadli is a tidy player who can score and create some goals, but he's not the type who is going to unlock a low block with a moment of genius or get past his man consistently. His game is movement, which is great, but it's not what we need in a match like today. Townsend is just pointless against a player like Azpilicueta. He will never beat him 1v1, ever. Today he didn't even give himself a chance to disappoint us with his final ball. 

I don't know that Lamela is the answer, but he definitely is our attacking midfielder who has produced the most moments of incisive passing this season. He is the only attacking midfielder we have who makes players gravitate towards him and then still possesses the ability to occasionally release an accurate ball under pressure. This means he will lose the ball a lot and frustrate people, but it also means he creates chances for us. 

I know this isn't popular anymore, but I still think we look a much more dangerous team when Lamela is on the pitch. And today in particular I know maybe he was tired but I feel he should have started because he matches up better against Azpilicueta than Townsend does. We didn't need someone to isolate the fullback and go 1v1 over and over (Azpi is probably the best 1v1 defending fullback in the league); we needed someone to drift around and drag people out of position. 

And if Lamela is not the answer, we need to find a way to create or purchase a more consistent player who plays similarly. We need to, as AVB puts it, provoke the opposition with the ball. That is what Lamela does...he creates space and breaks opposition shape with his movement, and on top of that he can see the passes and sometimes he even gets it right. 

This is the most important key to breaking down defensive teams, having players who can provoke the opposition with the ball, and IMO we don't really have enough players who can do this.

Glad you agree. The richest 2% are rich. 

&gt;There's a difference between being wealthy, and exorbitantly wealthy

Nobody said exorbitantly wealthy


&gt;50k+ is well off, but not wealthy. You will still be working for the majority of your adult life. Someone who's wealthy, chooses to work because, they have wealth, meaning they don't have a requirement to work. 

You are simply inventing your own definitions now.

You do realise that is household income. Not a single person.

null,false,anyjungleinguy,null,null,null,"&gt; Despite boasting an inspiring academic staff and vibrant student life, the university has a dark side to its campus culture. The ideological climate feels conducive for radicalization; even though the university never intended this, it seems to be a place where extremism can fester. I don’t know if that climate is what turned Mohammed Emwazi into Jihadi John, but Westminster was probably a factor in his radicalization.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; [...]

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; But the longer I spent on campus, the more I noticed strange occurrences and remarks that seemed to fit with an Islamist ideology. Eventually, I realized, these ideas were deeply ingrained at Westminster, allowing individuals to feel comfortable advocating dangerous and discriminatory beliefs.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; [...]

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I recall a seminar discussion about Immanuel Kant’s “democratic peace theory,” in which a student wearing a niqab opposed the idea on the grounds that “as a Muslim, I don’t believe in democracy.” Our instructor seemed astonished but did not question the basis of her argument; he simply moved on. I was perplexed, though. Why attend university if you have such a strict belief system that you are unwilling to consider new ideas? And why hadn’t the instructor challenged her? At the time, I dismissed her statement as one person’s outlandish opinion.

While it would possibly get some positive results this season if the board started whispering about firing Martinez, I don't see that as a good was to run a team long-term.

Just look at Arsenal. Their fans crop up every season dying for Wenger to be canned, but they always, always, always, always end up getting a Champions League spot. Sure, they may underperform at times, but they are one of the most stable teams in all of Europe because they have a manager who is constantly backed by the board, but still given criticism if he's not meeting expectations.

I think Martinez is a good manager, but has been stubborn this season. He wants to play a certain way, and he's trying to force this square peg into a round hole because it *could* take us to new heights, and the board must agree or he would be doing something to find ways to scrape across wins. He's not a stupid man. He has to know that playing men out of position isn't working smoothly, that Lukaku is struggling to become a positive player with his back to the goal, that the defense is so wrought with individual errors that anuses clench by the thousands in Goodison when a break comes at us. He's not deaf and he's not dumb.

The problem is that there's an argument now over whether this season is growing pains as Roberto seems to see it, or two broken legs that's been ignored as many of the fans see it. I honestly don't know if it's one or the other, but I do know that we've got a board that has around 100 years of combined experience amongst the top of them and a manager that *has* shown he can push a team forward, he just can't find the way to dig in his heels and stop them from going backward.

It's frustrating, for sure, but unless we end up relegated I'd rather have at least another season from Martinez rather than throw in the towel and turn to uncertainty.

Then you could ask me for my justification for that and judge me right or wrong.

It is a necessary part of islamism to kill unbelievers, so being an islamist is necessarily immoral.

I think we need an overhaul in the summer, manager and playing staff.

We're an ageing team that are beginning to look rudderless. We've missed out on some potential superstars, at the right age, in recent years; Hazard, Sanchez, Isco to name but a few.

Those are the kind of players we need to go for, young upcoming talents with a very clear bright future ahead of them.

Players like Koke and Pogba.

No more established players with decent reputations at lesser clubs; your Fernandos your Garcias, your Jovetics.

We've wasted a lot of money since 2011 on bang average players. A lot.

And for that reason I think we should also review Tixi's role as DOF. We can't afford any more missed opportunities while other teams are strengthening.

We need to recruit young players and get the next managerial appointment absolutely spot on.

&gt;Inter Milan allowing Coutinho to leave for £8.5m has to be one of the biggest transfer blunders of recent times. Credit to Liverpool though.

Whilst Martinez would have been influential in bringing Lukaku in, Bill may well have been more willing to invest in a proven scorer that take a 28m punt on a number of middling, or unproven players from abroad. 

If you think back to the start of the season, people were actually praising our depth, and many fans were over the moon at the window we had. Unfortunately, whoever makes the decision wasn't blessed with 20:20 foresight. 

Based on what we knew, I don't think Martinez could have predicted Atsu being incapable, McGeady being as bad as he has been and Pienaar being injured for so long, and struggling as much as he has. 

&gt;I have been defending Martinez all year long, but at some point you have to realize that his strategies don't work. He needs to change his ""philosophy"" a bit for us to get results.

That is exactly what he has done. We are playing so different  to how we were playing around xmas. 

We have begun to employ a defensive winger on the right, allowing more aggressive use of the overlap and we switched focus on killer balls down the middle- which again we have hardly done all year. This was closed out by Arsenal a lot of the time today (because they are a far better team), but has been instrumental in developing chances in our prior 2 games especially. 


Even if we were bettered by Arsenal today we moved the ball quickly and with a bit more confidence than we have. Whilst it was far from the flow of the Young Boys or Leicester games, nobody has that flow at The Emirates. I can see the style coming together, and the confidence returning to our play.  

&gt;A lot of the individual errors that you alluded to have come form us pass the ball around mid field and the opponent just picking off a bad pass.

The individual errors that have cost us have been horrific keeping and horrific finishing. Errors from 'passing it around' haven't been costing us recently at all.

null,false,Tarambor,null,null,null,"That app will work. It works out the speed from the GPS on your phone. The reading from the app is about as accurate as it is possible to get without spending really silly money.

&gt; My question is, if the reading on the app is more accurate, if I was caught on the camera, would you say that camera would pick up the speed that the app does or what the car reads?

Speed cameras work on the time it takes to travel between two points and therefore the actual real speed you're doing which will be almost identical to the GPS but for most cars somewhere around 10% higher than the speedo reads. 

Driving a truck through roadworks, because it has to be calibrated by law to within 2% accuracy and tested every 2 years, I usually end up following cars through 50 limits at 45MPH because on their speedo it'll be showing 50 due to the inaccuracy. Gets annoying as hell especially when its 20 miles of roadwork and you're time limited but I understand why they're doing 45MPH real speed. 

This also will explain why you see people bombing past you like you're going backwards but they don't seem to get flashed by a speed camera. Lets look again at the 50MPH limit and a speed camera set up for one. 

ACPO guidelines state a tolerance of 10%+2MPH AFAIR so on a 50 limit they're not going to trigger until 57MPH actual speed. Most speedos in cars over-read around 10% so 57MPH actual speed plus 10% over-read gives an indicated speed on your speedo of just over 62MPH. So if you're travelling at 50MPH on your speedo and they're driving at a real speed just low enough not to get caught, there could be a speed differential of just over 10MPH between you.

On motorways for many cars you have to be doing over 85MPH indicated speed on your speedo to trigger a speed camera.

He's trying to play us like Pep plays, but what he doesn't realize that we don't have the quality to pull off the tiki-taka style play.  Teams like Arsenal who have more quality in midfield are better built for that style of play.

I'm not saying we need to go to the long ball again like we did under Moyes, but we need to play more positive.

Edit:  Also what you said about us not being able to see Peinaar being injured or McGeady's lack of quality is an unacceptable excuse.  It's been known since the end of last season basically that Peinaar is on his last legs here, and it doesn't take a football expert to notice that McGeady has no end product.  We should have scouted him more and made a better decision based on that (something I'm pretty sure all football teams do).

It also explains that some drivers were a lot quicker...

Thanks for you advice, I will check this week. Is there any other devices that I could purchase instead of using the app (since I use navigation a lot) that is also accurate? 

I remember that when the speed was being filtered (to 40mph), I limited my speed to 50 (speed limiter feature in the car) and would hover between 45 and 50... So I just hope that I should be safe and wouldn't be ticketed....

&gt;Over 90% of people don't use trains to commute. It's fair that the majority of the prices fall on the commuters, particularly as the trains tend to be used in the more affluent metro areas.

I'd argue that we all benefit from having a good rail system, in the same way that we all benefit from having a good road of education system. I don't use the roads for example but I'm happy for my tax money to be spent on it. 

I'm not sure I agree that trains are used more by the affluent, I would expect in many areas you'll find that people commute into London, for example, are not just the super affluent. You'll find people from all areas of life. I think it would both morally and economically make sense that we don't price out people from using public transport.

null,false,Brian,null,null,null,"&gt;Are you trying to argue that future governments are legally bound to honour

No - I pointed out that there is no legal *barrier* to such commitments being applied.  Nor would there be for any other institution doing so (eg. the inheritance example).  However, now you mention it, I wouldn't be at all surprised if a court finds that they *are* legally bound by this.  Certainly, I'd expect at least the attempt at suing them if they did so.

And I think this is clearly a good thing.  For example, would you say the government could legally violate the human rights act for those who weren't born when the government signed it?  That's the government being bound by past commitments too, and fortunately they can and have been sued over violations of these commitments.  Why do you think this would, or should, be different? The government is bound by law and regulation too, and can be sued if it oversteps the mark.

&gt; Why should future generations be obligated to honour a promise they didn't make?

For the same reason they get to inherit the benefits of investments they didn't make - because the institution of government which they happen to belong to made those commitments.  There are certainly severe *practical* issues to governments going back on the commitments of previous governments - those that start confiscating money and property have the issue that they're not going to inspire much confidence in potential investors and wealthy residents.

You also don't seem to have addressed all the practical issues I've pointed out.  I really don't understand why on earth you think doing this is *remotely* preferable to just raising taxes to fund such programs - the usual way of raising such funds.

You will get a pittance from doing so (indeed, a negative amount if you **do** repay their NI payments, or people sue for them, and maybe even if you don't, since you'll need more bureacracy for the means testing).  You violate the obligations the government put in place.  You're justifying this by completely false claims, like that they haven't put in as much as they're getting out, when for the rich, the opposite is actually the case.  Given all this, what exactly makes you think this is remotely a good idea?  You have yet to present one reason why this is a good idea, given all these pitfalls, as opposed to something sensible and more practical like funding this through tax, rather than defaulting on promised pensions.",null,0,null,1425242171,null,0,false,0,cp1422o,null,t3_2xcgtz,null,t1_cp1422o,null,t1_cp0u5s3,null,null,null,1427523572,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

&gt; Project update from George:

&gt; Dear backers and comrades all,
I’m happy to report that the Blair Doc is now, finally, on the home stretch. Over the winter period we’ve been busy tying up the remainder of our 40+ interviews (among them our second and third former cabinet ministers) and planning the post-production process. As a result, we have now secured a top-end editor who has started to put the film together. Meanwhile, our composer Steve Finnerty from Alabama 3 (of Sopranos theme-tune fame), is working on an original score with the help of art rock legend Robert Wyatt. We are also working with graphic designers, animators to make sure our documentary looks the part too.

&gt; As a feature-length doc covering a wide range of topics, and with extensive archive footage and many, many interviews, we expect the edit to take at least 12 weeks to complete, and will give the editor the time he needs to make the finished article as good as it can be. With further post-production work required after editing is complete, it is still too early to set a formal release date.

&gt; Back in the (sur)real world the winter months been rather less successful for Mr Blair. From the public disgust at his GQ and Save the Children ‘philanthropy’ awards to his placing in the metaphorical dock by parliamentary Lords and even Nick Clegg (yes you heard correctly) over the CIA torture report and the Chilcot Inquiry, even I am surprised at how quickly mainstream opinion has turned against Blair. Indeed it appears we’re approaching somewhat of a zeitgeist. You may recall Kony 2012. By the looks of things this year’s shaping up to be ‪#‎Tony2015‬. Thanks to your support, myself and the Blair Doc team will do our best to make sure of it.

The act of just changing some numbers is concealing. Initialing (your suggestion) can be very very small. If it was deliberately made to be visible so they would notice (and that would mean BIG), otherwise they would probably state it was done to be deceptive. I appreciate the letter of the law may technically allow it, but I think the fact that you are effectively giving a company a new contract which you signed on their behalf might swing it against you. (because that is what you have done in this case)

My point about Unfair contract only applies to the bit you said about credit agreements and has no relevance to employment contract (because it only applies when the company writes the contract). You can argue an unfair credit agreement - and people do and win.

The first goal was a stupid foul to give away by Chadli and should have been cleared much better - poor decision making.

There were a number of times when we went for long range shots when it was still early in the game and we were dominating - poor game management.

We also got wound up by the Chelsea players (who are very good at doing that, esp. Costa) and Dier, Mason lost their heads a bit. Luckily it didn't cost us with a red but anyone who has played football knows that getting wound up like that will affect your game - and Dier and Mason, for me, weren't at their best as a result. The same goes for a few others. That's just a lack of experience - we have an incredibly young squad with a lot of talent, which is exciting, but in big games like this (and in the Europa league) you need senior players to take control.

8th Doctor:

Grace - Cardiologist working in San Francisco. Helps the Doctor defeat the Master's attempt to open the Eye of Harmony and Destroy the Earth. Refuses to join the Doctor.

9th Doctor:

Rose: Regular girl from London. Joins the TARDIS after helping the Doctor defeat the Nestene Consciousness. Merges with the Time Vortex at one point creating the ""Bad Wolf"" entity. Witnesses 9's Regeneration. She's trapped in an alternate universe (Pete's World) while traveling with the 10th Doctor. Briefly returns to help prevent a Dalek plot to destroy the Multiverse and returns to her Universe with a Human-Timelord Clone of the 10th Doctor. The Moment mimics Rose.


Mickey: Rose's ex-boyfriend. Initially serves as ""Man on the ground"" to Rose and the Doctor but eventually joins the TARDIS with the 10th Doctor. Chooses to stay in Pete's World to live with his Grandmother (who is dead in the Main universe) as their version of Mickey has died. Returns when Cybermen from Pete's World invade the main universe Earth. Returns to the main universe after his Grandmother Dies in Pete's World and marries Martha.

Adam: Secretary at an underground vault in America containing advanced weaponry and gadgets. Travels with the 9th Doctor and Rose for one episode and is returned to his time after he tries to reveal the future to his parents. 

Jack: Time Agent Rose and the Doctor meet in WW2. Is killed by Daleks and then revived by Rose infused with the Time Vortex. Revives the clandestine organization ""Torchwood"" and assists the 10th Doctor on several occasions. The subject of the Spin-Off ""Torchwood"". Current status is unknown. 
  



10th Doctor:


Martha:  Medical Student who meets the Doctor after her hospital is sent to the Moon. Leaves the TARDIS because of the Doctors fixation on loosing Rose. Joins U.N.I.T. and assists the Doctor on several occasions. Marries Mickey.

Astrid: Waitress onboard the Space Titanic. She falls to her death in the same episode

Donna: Secretary who meets the Doctor on her eventually aborted Wedding Day. Refuses to join the TARDIS initially but later joins after Martha. She undergoes a Human-Timelord metacrisis imbuing her with TimeLord knowledge. Her memories of the Doctor are blocked to prevent the Time Lord knowledge from frying her brain. 

River: You're already familiar with her I believe. Her first appearance (Last Chronologically) is with the 10th Doctor.  

10th Doctor Specials (Lots of companions most were oneshots and not all that important except for one):

Wilfred - Donna's grandfather. Gets a team together to track down the Doctor in response to strange dreams the world has been having. Inadvertently triggers the 10th Doctor's Regeneration. Goes back to his life.

The UK seems to place some level of culpability on words that are spoken (as an extension of thought) and I don't doubt if machines existed (or are invented) that allow reading into people thoughts, that the UK government will be one that immediately looks to utilise them in routing out the 'silent but guilty'.

We are already halfway down the 'wedge' as it were by determining some speech to be illegal and others to be comedy, or expression of freedom, or offensive but only to people we don't care about....

So the UK finds itself in this precarious place of standing against regimes on the basis they limit the freedoms of their people to speak openly, whilst holding the similar positions when it comes to their own people.

Or perhaps it's time to drop the bullshit stance that we're all for 'freedom of expression' altogether and admit that our main argument is that they are not like us, they terrorise us and this is merely a nation state security issue where morality doesn't come into it. I don't think the UK government really cares about beheadings - we happily partner with Saudi Arabia for their oil, and beheadings have been taking place in a brutal fashion in the region for centuries.

It's only the cotton wool raised British public who are horrified by these new edited HD versions that look disturbingly well shot like scenes from movies. I think it's the genuine fear of seeing a people who they consider to be backward and 'last century' actually embracing a culture and language they consider to be wholly owned by the West. It's shocking because it makes it look like it's happening down their street as opposed to millions of miles away in some place they don't care about.

The interesting thing about WW2 was that we didn't know about the holocaust at all, and upon hearing about it (after all but defeating Hitler) most people's reactions were that it was too unbelievable. We didn't battle Hitler to save the Jews, we battled Hitler because we were afraid for our own security. Another irony of WW2 is that after the conquering of Germany, we put many German citizens to work in labour camps subject in much the same abusive conditions as the Jews (without the gas chambers part).

I appreciate the desire for such a ideolgoical pure standpoint as so, but i'm afraid I hold to the idea that pragmatism does not create a world of wedges.

Moreover, i'd simply like to point out that even the most hardcore freedom of speech position that is above advocating some sort of nihilistic choas never accepted that inciting a riot or slander/liable were within its remit.

i think the real problem is that there are quite a few rather naive conceptions of liberalism out there that need to really accept that one of the biggest lessons of the last 150~ years, is are particular acute today is that value neutral liberalism (all ideologies however repugant are basically equal) is a utter failure. 

Value positive liberalism on the other hand, where we just have to bite the bullet and embrace the fact that whilst we can imagine a society in which the catholic and the atheist, the social democrat and the christian conservative get on. And which Islam most certaintly has a place.

THere are things which don't and unforunately we need to get real on wahhabism here.

And i'm sorry this notion that, 

a) FREEDOM OF SPEECH IS A FUNDAMENTAL GOOD.

b) its either at 10 or 0.

Is a horredeously misguided doctrine and one of the bastions of this value natural liberalism that I would hope history has shown now allows cancer to eat open societies from the inside. 

There are only a few red lines, but rejecting pluralism out of hand is one of them. Suggesting a system which would entrench your ideology with no opposition being allowed, even in a gradual peaceful democratic process. Is a no. Sorry, get out.

Aiming high is striving to place equal weight on playing with style and winning things. That's what Spurs were about in that era--that's what set us apart from teams like Arsenal--not merely winning, but winning with style. 

I don't think this quote applies to losing a league cup final, but I think we need to get back to that sort of philosophy, especially in the modern era where people who don't support the top 2-3 clubs by necessity have to find more meaning in the game than just pieces of silverware.
