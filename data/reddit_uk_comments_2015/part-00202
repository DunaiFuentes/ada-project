But objectively I'm looking at Benteke, and I like him a lot more than a lot of people. He has a lot of great qualities and I do believe he will do well for us.

If he can put in 15+ goals in the league for us, that could be the difference between 6th and 4th, which to me is worth 32 million. 


It's obviously risky, but watching Benteke and knowing what we're missing. I'm with the club on this one and think it's worth the risk.

&gt;

&gt;__Joan Maud Littlewood__ (6 October 1914 – 20 September 2002) was an English theatre director, best known for her work in developing the [Theatre Workshop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre_Workshop). She has been called ""The Mother of Modern Theatre"".  Her production of ""Oh, What a Lovely War!"" in 1963 was by far her most influential piece.

&gt;Littlewood and her company lived and slept in the [Theatre Royal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre_Royal_Stratford_East) while it was restored. Productions of *[The Alchemist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Alchemist_(play\))* and *[Richard II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_II_(play\))*, the latter starring [Harry H. Corbett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_H._Corbett) in the title role, established the reputation of the company. 

&gt;She also conceived and developed the Fun Palace in collaboration with architect [Cedric Price](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedric_Price), an experimental model of a participatory social environment that, although never realized, has become an important influence in the architecture of the 20th and 21st centuries.

You could also get a USD account in order to use bitstamp or stick with GBP for coinbase/coinfloor. If you get a USD account you can use currencyfair.com to move money from your main account to the USD account efficiently.. With GBP it's simpler since you just transfer it via Faster payments to Lloyds International and then forward over SWIFT to coinbase or coinfloor.

http://international.lloydsbank.com/international-current-accounts/

The account opening KYC (they photocopy your passport) can be done at any lloyds branch.

Another option that I have not personally tried but seems like it would work well is www.cryptocapital.co - now that they've partnered with https://coinapult.com/.. basically cryptocapital will give you your own Polish EUR IBAN that's unique to you.. that means it probably won't ever get banned by transferwise.com or currencyfair or any of the other transfer companies that don't allow transfers to known bitcoin associated IBANs.

so you can use transferwise to send money to your cryptocapital account and then spend it on coinapult to get BTC.

I would love it if people were expressing that idea, because it would then (hopefully) lead to people listening to others' experiences. However I don't think many of the people in this thread are expressing that sentiment *at all*. 

&gt;Do you know what it is like to be super-rich? No?

&gt;Then why do you presume what super-rich can and cannot comprehend?

Because I don't believe that human beings are capable of **fully** comprehending experiences they have never had. I would not expect somebody who had never taken drugs to understand what MDMA or Cocaine are like. I wouldn't expect a lifelong office worker to understand what fighting in Afghanistan would be like. I wouldn't expect someone with fully capable vision to understand what being blind was like 

&gt;""you don't understand me so you cannot speak for me""

&gt;the converse is also true - ""I don't understand you so I cannot make any assumptions about what you do and don't know"".

I don't think those two statements are as linked as you think they are. Knowledge and understanding are different things. I can know the details of what someone has done, but I may not understand why he did those things, I might not understand what those things were like. I think it is much more reasonable to make statements about somebody's provable lack of experience than it is to say that someone's experience is irrelevant.

Going back to the Beckham children, I imagine that they face some problems I never will and I never want to; the creeping suspicion that every new friend is only trying to get access to money or a different social circle, the sense that everybody else thinks you have a perfect life and that you don't have any right to complain about anything, the feeling that lots of people will compare you to your overwhelmingly successful parents, etc. I can imagine they might have those experiences, and I am fully willing to say I have no idea what those feelings are like on that scale.

I really don't understand why you think you can simply lie to the one person reading this who knows you're bullshitting. 

1. The only reason I mentioned other vehicles is in response to you bringing other vehicles into things.
2. That quote you're referring to is an explanation of why both the speed AND/OR presence of other vehicles is immaterial.

And I can repeat that here: It does not fucking matter if she's behind a lorry. If her speed between two points is 100mph, then that's what it is, irrespective of ANY other object on the road at the time.

&gt; You seem keen to ignore that fact, probably because it makes you look a fucking mong. 

Or it could be because it is completely meaningless save for as evidence that you're some kind of autist who can't handle that they've completely fucked this up.

If we're talking about things being ignored because it makes you look like a fucking mong, we can look at:

- Your continued insistence that I was the one who introduced other vehicles into the analogy when anyone can easily see it was [you, here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/37ftme/car_stuck_in_tree_after_driver_loses_control_when/crngmox)
- You deciding ""I'm not saying the data CANT prove her guilt, I'm saying it's not necessarily likely to"" - it's been a full day and your explanation for why this should be so is still unforthcoming.
- The fact I needed to show you how to calculate speed - something every 13 year old learns in school - in response to your smug assumption that such a thing was impossible.
- How you're yet to explain how noting the time taken to pass two points - where the two points are fucking cameras - is circuitous or ""evidentially unsuitable"" (whatever the fuck that even means).
- Why you believe CCTV cameras are inaccurate enough to bring them up here as seriously harmful to my position.
- What variables I need to be aware of out of two cameras and a car.
- I've put up the post immediately before the one in which you introduced the hypothetical lorry, inviting you to quote the part in which I ""introduce other vehicles"". And you still haven't done this. Why?

&gt;

&gt;The __Royal Parks Operational Command Unit__ is a unit of the [Metropolitan Police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police) which has responsibility for policing the [Royal Parks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Parks) found in central London. 

&gt;Core police teams provide 24-hour coverage to the 17 Royal Parks, Gardens and other open spaces within the [Metropolitan Police District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police_District) - an area in excess of 6,000 acres (24 km^2).

&gt;Spread across the five boroughs in which the various Parks are located, the pan-London service given by the Royal Parks Operational Command Unit is in addition to that provided by local borough police. The unit is currently commanded by a [Superintendent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintendent_(police\)).

I personally don't rate him as highly as most of this sub seemingly does. I think he's a good player but I feel a lot of supporters overrate or overhype him. 

I think a lot of people are just excited by his potential. He's very calm and composed on the ball, makes deep driving runs etc. He's been a bright spark at times in a very ugly season. It's Januzaj syndrome. 

He's only 21, and shows good signs of leadership and passion. Which is something the fans love too. 

I think he's struggled with not having a defined role in the squad. Once he was imbedded into his CB role he was a lot more assured. He still made mistakes as someone new to the position would however. 

So my hope is he gets more stabilized next season. Give him a defined role to work into the club. He still shows glimpses of inexperience and naivety, but the potential is clear as day.

For cheap university food to cook, go to LIDL and ALDI. I can't be certain that they are in Cardiff, but most likely! Bangor, which is much smaller has a small Chinese super market where you can buy bag fulls of assorted rice and discount prices. I'm sure Cardiff will have the same.

They're not. HAs build houses from the profits they would've made which they're not allowed to have. The amount they sell them for even with the discount is more than it cost them to build them which is why the discount is what it is and not more. The price is based on the market price so as house prices rise the HAs get even more over the price of what it cost to build the houses in the first place. This then gives the HAs enough money to fund building more houses. Its a win win for everyone. People who could never afford to buy get to buy, HAs get money to replace the houses they've sold.

So they're not being asked to give away all their assets at all or anything like it.

Being in the EU is complicated and it's about lots of different things. It's both about having autonomy as a country to make your own laws whilst also having the European Union as sort of an umbrella law-maker. So for instance, here in the UK, British law is that we don't allow prisoners the right to vote. (Someone correct me if I'm wrong on Scotland/Wales/N. Ireland?) The European Union says we *should* allow prisoners the right to vote and that the UK should change our laws. If someone feels that the British High Courts also don't rule correctly on a case, they can elevate it to the European Courts to get a ruling turned under EU law. 

We also have free travel and settling rights within the EU and a common market to do business, which sometimes clashes because a big political agenda over here is bringing down immigration numbers, but that's hard to do if people are allowed to move freely around all European countries. We can't just change our rules to ban EU migrants, because that would upset other EU countries with whom we do business, like Germany and France. Does that make sense? It's about communal agreements, but also about power and business and the economy too.

null,false,B4mf0rth,null,null,null,"Well any UK decision should be conducted within our remit in NATO and alongside our allies. Unilateral decisions aren’t the way forward. I’m taking that as an assumption, it can obviously be challenged but I don’t think enough people are in favour of UK: World Police solo actions. Moving on, you have several points of view for the UK and NATO, each with their own merits and downfalls. Here are three common ones

1.	***""The Middle East should sort itself out, we shouldn't get involved""*:** 
An intuitively strong view in the post-Bush era, but ultimately a pretty pathetic solution. Who is actually going to sort it out? The only powers in the Middle East who could help are the strong opposing powers like Saudi Arabia and Iran. This creates a myriad of problems for leaving ISIS to the Middle East, three of which are:

A) Saudi Arabia and Iran would get very twitchy if the other started conducting military interventions, and with Chinese/Russian interests in Iran vs the American interests in Saudi Arabia, not only in oil but in general trade – any conflict could have devastating results to global stability. Jordan has some capability to defend itself and conduct a limited offensive role in intelligence and air power but not enough to hold down a region about the size of itself. 

B) Israel would view any Islamic power’s intervention in the region with extreme suspicion, particularly Iran. Which given the trigger-happy nature of the Knesset, any Mid-East led intervention could very easily lead to some nasty incidents. If tensions between Sunni and Shia states would already be at breaking point during an intervention, Israel could very well be the catalyst straw that breaks the camel’s back.

C) Iran and Saudi Arabia really aren’t countries that should be conducting interventions. I’m certainly not going to pretend that the West is definitely up to the task, but with Saudi Arabia bombing Yemeni hospitals, and Iran’s alleged backing for some particularly nasty groups in Iraq and Afghanistan, in addition to their domestic politics, we cannot expect any amount of international law and human rights to be protected under their counterinsurgency operations. After things like Rwanda, Liberia etc we should be very wary of apathy.  

**2 *”No ground forces, but increased airstrikes”*:**
There is an issue of the UK’s capacity to do this which someone else in this thread has raised, though certainly other NATO countries, particularly the US would have the resources to do this. The continuing issue is actually not one of capacity but one of intelligence and targeting. 

We actually have very poor intelligence on the ground of where ISIS is. Intelligence provided by local forces has sometimes been simply wrong or out of date by the time it gets up the chain of command. Surveillance drones and the limited special forces raids can only do so much, so beyond that we are in a position where bad information may be deciding where bombs are dropped. Not exactly ideal. 

Furthermore much of the fighting takes place within cities that still often hold civilians, and have extremely close quarters fighting between ISIS and opposing militias making the risk of airstrikes to innocents or friendly forces very high. Increased airstrikes that end up hurting “our guys” or innocents may just have a negative effect, and increase support for ISIS.

**3 *Introduce ground forces*:**

This raises many further questions which need to be examined thoroughly before ground forces become an option. Such as:

What size of ground force? Some non-combatant advisers? Special Forces? Would they be able to actually roll back the Caliphate army? What about a significant ground force? Would having a significant NATO ground force result in the local forces not being built up? Would NATO solving the ISIS problem for them leave the region in the same fragmented ungoverned unstable state that let ISIS come to power in the first place? How much are we actually willing to contribute to the region in terms of money and blood? Even if we managed to defeat ISIS as a territorial force (i.e. one that holds territory), would they just retreat to being a guerrilla/insurgent force like the Taliban, Al-Qaeda or OMS and just continue like the Taliban? Would a drastically stepped up military surge actually have local support when it came to soldiers and tanks on the streets? Would ISIS just simply step up its use of civilians as human shields as many insurgent groups have done when faced with western forces, thereby putting more civilians in harm’s way? Who do we ally ourselves with in a war where almost every militia has been accused of pretty barbaric tactics? Given the huge expense of ground forces and the current economic situation, we would have to withdraw pretty sharpish once ISIS is defeated, but who do we leave behind? Can we trust them to provide security? How do we address the issues that have led to ISIS? Would ground forces actually defeat ISIS or just escalate the bloodbath? With ground forces, what remit do we have towards the area? Do we regard Kurdish held areas as Kurdistan or do we view them as Iraq? To whom do we ascribe sovereignty for what areas? Do we utilise existing local power structures (tribal leaders/sheiks etc) or do we view their possibly patriarchal/corrupt/ultra-religious influence as part of the problem we are solving?

I myself am not sure about ground forces being deployed, primarily because I don’t see enough of those questions being answered satisfactorily. People call blindly for “more to be done” and “let’s get some forces on the ground”, but without the necessary understanding of what that entails. We should learn from Iraq and Afghanistan and acknowledge that we actually need to be a bit more intelligent if we are going to be successful in the Middle East.

The USA and Canada are in many respects ""more English"" than England culturally and language-wise, because we are more removed from that influence. I could source it for you but since all caps ha ha-ing is your level of discourse i dont know why i would bother. 

Suffice it to say though, that if you did a little research, often you will find that the british and american words for something were the same in say 1650, and then over time the british adopted the french word for something, or bastardized it, and the US continued using the original. So in those cases, the way i talk is truer to ""english"" than the way you talk.

And obviously for hundreds of years the exclusive language of the ""english"" nobility was french, because they were all french and not angles or saxons at all.

null,false,Lanfeix,null,null,null,"Indeed money is an mental concept invented to facilitate the trade of goods and labour, but its not all made up by the goverment. Bank Of England is a private bank who we gave the right to create money. 

By not being in the Euro and remaining with our Pound the deficit from our money is implicitly borrowed from BOE. IF all the deficit money was implicitly printed instead of debt we end up in inflationary economy which would in hyperinflation and crash. As such we can never use printing money as an answer to all cost. Printing money should could be used for one off large payments with minor effect or at a slow steady trickle as it is done normally but as printing money belongs to a private institution not the goverment so when it is done it is not given to the UK goverment. The goverment debt is very useful, such as for pension annuities with out it pension annuities would have to be based off companies which can collapse like they did in the past. 

Where as in the EU a governments deficit is not implicitly borrowed from the central bank of the EU, which is what caused Greece plenty of problems as the other governments answer to solve the Greece finical problems where to force austerity. Which has failed because Austerity is failed concept because it ignores the effect of finical markets 'boom &amp; bust' and finical multiplier effect. Due to boom and bust we will have periods where tax incomes will fall causing the government to end up in deficit (where income does not match expenditure, not total debt), it will be deficit due to the finical multiplier effect. Government expenditure on project which do not have a natural income source or income source is far to long term an investment have a finical multiplier effect. Cutting welfare and other cost which has a positive finical multiplier have reduce the GDP and in turn reduced tax income which has increased finical deficit.

As many argue we are not in austerity for the last year and the torys have been just up to there usual shit of cutting expenditure on the poor and taxes while rewarding pensioners for there continued votes. The voter of this country have been fooled by finical winds, the market would have recovered austerity or not. Austerity followed by tory fiscal incompetence has just slowed and lowered recovery.

Younger people (the demographic I imagine makes up the majority of drug users) aren't usually known for their ability to think critically and calculate risks. Call it ignorance or youthful adventurousness or whatever, it's a phenomena that most of us suffer from.

How many of us did stupid things at 18/19 that our adult self looks back and thinks ""What the hell were you thinking!?""

At that age you think you're invincible. Bad things happen but not to you. It's why the Army targets teenagers and young people in their recruiting campaigns. It's why young people are involved in more traffic accidents. It's why young people tend to prefer extreme sports.

Now throw other phenomena into the mix such as peer pressure, the teenage desire to have an identity and 'belong', and the thrill of doing something taboo and or illegal, and it's pretty easy to see why people try these things for the first time.

Obviously once you've already done it, doing it a second time becomes much easier. And it becomes just another way of having fun and chilling out. The same reason most people drink alcohol (which itself is a pretty dangerous substance).

Obviously there are outliers. Some people take drugs to escape from a miserable life. Some people take drugs just because they enjoy experimenting with shit like that. But I imagine in general the majority of drug users start using for the reasons I said above.

But first, lets go backwards and see how narrow the looking glass has become for the conversation to fit your narrative. We've gone from talking about how completely unjust it is for entire peoples to appropriate other peoples cultures, to "" a very small pool of people"" in the music industry are favoring white artists. 

I'm not saying you're wrong, this very well might be the case. Maybe white artists make people who only care about the bottom line more money in certain markets, probably white markets. Just like black artists, lets specifically say black rappers, are more popular in the culture they originated from. Or say bollywood actors are far more popular in asia than they are in the wes. So on and so fourth.

But even then, statistics don't lie:
http://www.musictimes.com/articles/10693/20140923/dr-dre-tops-forbes-list-of-highest-paid-rappers-beats-out-jay-z-p-diddy-drake.htm

That's not nearly enough data to draw those sorts of conclusions.

To do so would either be a result of fraudulent intent or utter ignorance of what the numbers actually mean.

Sure, if you have the total number of claimants, and then the same data for the previous period, you can work out if (as a %) more claimants have died in this period or the last.

But that still doesn't tell you anything about the efficacy (or lack thereof) of the benefits system without *much* more detailed patient data, information on their healthcare, socio-economic background and problems (or excellence) in the relevant NHS Trusts where those people died.

For instance, in 1996 there was a spike in firearm related deaths because of Dunblane. But firearms crime was on the rise anyway due to gang activity (and wasn't curbed until Operation Trident started to have effect ~2005). Without knowing about those individual events, and separating out the crimes committed with legally-held (white market) and illegally-held (black market) firearms, those spikes and trends are impossible to accurately analyse as regards cause and effect. After all, firearms crime rose between 1997 and 2005, despite the private ownership of handguns being banned - because the black market continued unabated by the ban (they were already operating illegally!), and wasn't curbed until law enforcement operations were launched.

If a claimant was murdered, or died on the operating table, then they've died whilst on benefits, but clearly under circumstances that have no relation whatsoever to their benefit status.

Since you won't know how those claimants died, you have **absolutely no way** of drawing any meaningful conclusions from the simple statement of ""x people died"". It's worthless without the breakdowns of whether they all died in surgery, of a terminal illness, in a road traffic accident, as a victim of crime (murder/burglary gone bad).

The number of deaths is utterly meaningless in isolation and anyone who tries to make *any claims* based on it is either an idiot or a charlatan.

Dictionary definitions don't mean squat when you can't see the idiocy of your own statements. When I grew up the more common way of expressing dissatisfaction with an ethnic member of the community was to start the sentence with ""I'm not a racist, but...""

Just to remind you..

&gt;I'm not racist, ~~don't even start~~.  **but** Europe should hold onto its white heritage. White people do not want to be a minority in their own continent.

And I love the way your domain extends suddenly from London to the whole of Europe - large swathes of which aren't even historically white. Spain was Moorish (my lot again) following invasions (yea, we're bad) and the languages there reflect that influence. Oh and we left some interesting architecture behind too.

So this is your continent and not mine nor anyone else from my extended family who have lived here for the past 70 years or so. You are deluded if you think you are even close to being a minority in the UK, or even in London. 

You don't like London because it doesn't conform to *your* idea of a what a modern city should be. You know what? You don't have to come anywhere near the place if you feel so strongly. You can just sit and rant about how great the past was and how white people are under represented in modern Britain. Tough! London is how it is today precisely because of the UK's past successes. Empire, Oil, massive business influence across the entire planet are what have created the amazing melting pot that is modern London (and the other cities I mentioned previously). If you can't cope with your own culture's success story then I think you have some issues you really need to address.

Another huge success story in London at the moment is the hipster movement with its range of artisan foods of all varieties, but mostly featuring a revival of old English cuisines and craft beers. But you wouldn't know about that because of all the black people obscuring your view of the white guys with funny beards or because you read somewhere (in a UKIP pamphlet or on CNN) that there are ghettoes and no whites areas down here.

Last time I looked the UK, including London, had a dominant white (and male) ruling elite, media, and corporate directorship demographic.

I'm not saying Villa are pushovers, but if we make a decent bid, its very hard for any club to refuse a player which wants to leave badly. Furthermore, Benteke hasn't made a fool of himself (unlike Sterling), which makes it easier for the club to let go of him.

I'm just throwing figures based on what i've seen of him, but IMO Benteke is worth around 15-20million.

null,false,Shaft-of-Patriarchy,null,null,null,"The lorry i brought in was brought in as an EXAMPLE of a hazard, not as another vehicle to be compared. As pretty much everyone here but you spotted. 

It was subtle i know, but the clue was the use of the words ""For example"". Comprehension not being your strong suit i can see how you missed it, but you'll get there trooper.

&gt;If her speed between two points is 100mph, then that's what it is, irrespective of ANY other object on the road at the time.

Yes sweetie, which is near enough exactly what i said here:

&gt;She either is, or is not, above the average speed.
&gt;If she is above it, then it doesn't in the least bit matter what the other drivers were doing from the point of view of her prosecution

But the point which you seem unable to get through your skull, is that comparing her speed across the piece MAY not yield useful information if her AVERAGE remained lower than the limit, as i said here: 

&gt;If her average isn't above the speed limit, then its still entirely possible that she was still speeding, but that at some point unseen during the journey she must have slowed down to such an extent as to balance out the average speed. 

The reasons for her reduction are irrelevant, but for clarity i gave an example of the KIND OF THING that might cause an otherwise reckless driver to slow down, a lorry getting in her way. Again, as everyone other than you managed to understand. 

As for lying, i don't really see how quoting your own fucking post constitutes lying. Its pretty blatantly obvious that in my original post containing it, at no point was it implied that the police would be comparing the speed of the lorry, merely that it was one of the range of things that might cause her to slow, which would help to disguise any other speeding that she may have done over the distance. Its also fairly obvious that you used the fucking words: 

&gt;They would just compare her check times to all the other vehicles on the same stretch of road

Unless you are inclined to argue that ""They would just compare"" means ""They absolutely would not compare"", that means you brought it in. 

If you can demonstrate how me pointing that out constitutes dishonesty, you give it your best go. 

&gt;If we're talking about things being ignored because it makes you look like a fucking mong, we can look at:
Your continued insistence that I was the one who introduced other vehicles into the analogy when anyone can easily see it was you, here.

Already raised, it was you, its right there for you to read. Again. But i can see you struggle with that, i mean for example your retort to my post showing you that calculating speed is a mathematical task, and providing evidence of the same was to post a link to KS3 science page which actually failed to mention anything about the topic whatsoever, that's the level of thickheadedness I'm dealing with here, i despair... 

&gt;You deciding ""I'm not saying the data CANT prove her guilt, I'm saying it's not necessarily likely to"" - it's been a full day and your explanation for why this should be so is still unforthcoming.

Already explained. The data would only prove her guilt if the AVERAGE was above the limit. It may well not be, even if she was speeding for a good portion of the time. If she slowed down at other times to balance it out. That right there is literally how averages work. And further its why averages are only used for speed enforcement in certain situations which are appropriate to its limitations. 

You're clearly going to need an illustration to help you, i would imagine the pictures are your favorite parts of most books eh?

If you know that the distance between the two most recent cameras is 2 miles. And the time it took her to travel that distance is 4 minutes. That would yield an average speed of 30mph. So, the speed limit on the motorway being 70 she obviously (according to your ass backwards logic) wasn't speeding. Even if she spent 3 minutes 30 seconds basically stationary off camera and then sped up to 240mph in order to cover the remaining 99% of the distance in 30 seconds, within the 4 minute window that exists between the two observances on camera. Which is all the data we have. An extreme example, but one is needed to make you actually understand the point. Just because you can calculate her average speed doesn't mean its NECESSARILY guaranteed to give you a clear view of whether she was speeding or not. It MAY, as i said in the first post, if the average is over the limit, but it may not be even if she was driving at extreme speed for the relevant portion of the journey.

&gt;The fact I needed to show you how to calculate speed - something every 13 year old learns in school - in response to your smug assumption that such a thing was impossible.

Umm, no you actually didn't sweetie, im fully aware of how to calculate it. I'm also aware of the limitations of averages in these circumstances.

&gt;How you're yet to explain how noting the time taken to pass two points - where the two points are fucking cameras - is circuitous or ""evidentially unsuitable"" (whatever the fuck that even means).

It was circuitous to use the data of ""Other vehicles we know are travelling at the speed limit"" (I remind you knobhead, your words, not mine) to attempt to calculate this. Calculating it directly based on the data we have on the specified vehicle was not stated to be circuitous, merely using other vehicles to do it, which was, again, YOUR suggestion. 

&gt;Why you believe CCTV cameras are inaccurate enough to bring them up here as seriously harmful to my position.

The camera isn't. But the time its set to might well be. If the time is out by a few minutes at one, and a few seconds at another, you cant use them to calculate average speeds, any lawyer worth his salts will pull that shit apart in about 30 seconds and laugh in your face. GATSO and handheld radar devices have to be specifically calibrated and certificates of calibration and maintenance logged. Because they are used evidentially for criminal proceedings, their accuracy has to be precise. CCTV (Or ANPR cameras which you are actually thinking of) are not designed for speed enforcement. They may be perfectly calibrated and timed. They may not. If they aren't, they aren't reliable. Simples. 

&gt;What variables I need to be aware of out of two cameras and a car.

Again referring to the additional variable of a second car, based on your suggestion. 

&gt;I've put up the post immediately before the one in which you introduced the hypothetical lorry, inviting you to quote the part in which I ""introduce other vehicles"". And you still haven't done this. Why?

You didnt introduce it in that message, you introduced it in the message AFTER the one where i discussed the lorry, because your reading comprehension blows and you misinterpreted my example of the lorry as being related to using it to compare speed, as opposed to as an example of the kinds of hazard that could cause the driver to slow down, to any speed. 

That error right there, and the smoke you are blowing to attempt to disguise it, is the core of how this ended up being a huge omnishambles on your part.

The facts are that a person in charge of diversity is actively discriminating against a particular race and gender. From an outside perspective that sounds insane. I'm undecided on safe space groups as a whole. I understand the point and that's fine. But the message it sends is that discrimination based on race and gender is okay in certain circumstances. Not sure everyone will always agree on what those circumstances are which is why I thought we were supposed to be against it.

&gt;Though it's hard to not feel we're in an echo chamber outside of which is an unchanging majority.

Social progression has been pretty consistent in the west for the passed, say, 60 years. There's not much reason to think we would start rowing backwards on that. People are becoming more tolerant because we have little reason to believe some of the awful things our ancestors did. 

Economic disadvantage is getting worse however. The gap between the rich and the poor blah blah blah getting bigger. Unpicking racial and gender discrimination from the law is paramount. After that it's just a matter of getting money into poor people's hands then I feel these power imbalances will correct themselves.

null,false,epeeist,null,null,null,"&gt;So to sum up: you know what words mean better than dictionaries and academics, and people that don't live in the range of a mixed school (for whatever reason) only have themselves to blame and don't deserve access to non-segregated education. Also, for the record, you are legally obliged to educate your children so none of your analogies there hold.

I didn't say they don't deserve integrated education, I think it's great that the sector is expanding and hope that demand increases. But I'm not going to pretend it's an outrage that the entire school sector hasn't been dismantled and rebuilt in the space of 30 years. 

If someone feels strongly that they want their child to go to an integrated school, they should take steps to make that happen, either by lobbying for one to be set up in the area or by moving to an area where one exists. How on earth is that unfair to say?

&gt; The split in the education system is, in my opinion, incredibly damaging to the hopes of future generations being accepting of each other's communities.

But of course, your opinion is more valid than mine and of the hundreds of thousands of families who continue to use split education even when integrated education is available. Silly me.

Things are *already better* despite the fact that we don't have universal integrated education. For me that's because we're beginning to address the root causes of the sectarian tension, which are social, cultural and political. Education is one aspect of the social sphere. Nobody has rationalised why integrated education, and integrated education alone, is the only way to solve NI's problems.

Many people get confused and try to use a niche sociological definition that adds power dynamics into it. However, that definition was originally intended only for use in its specific context and has numerous problems if it is mixed up with the standard definition.

For instance you essentially create good and bad racism. It's good if the minority is racist but bad if the majority is racist. Well actually what happens is only the bad racism is discussed and the good racisms is covered in 'well don't you see how it is different?'. The next problem you encounter is how do you define majority and minority? Is 51% enough for a majority? 60% 90% 95% 99%? How do you define the group from which the majority is calculated? Globally, nationally, locally? If a city area had a 95% black population would it be okay for white residents to hold a meeting that banned black people?

I don't see what is so hard to understand that all racism is bad. It engenders the idea that prejudice and discrimination is allowed and fosters a sense of isolationism and bad feeling. You can't discriminate and expect acceptance.

That is key, discrimination - in any sense - and acceptance are mutually exclusive. Better relations between communities only comes about due to acceptance and then integration.

I have two captain choices as I cant decide between Sakho and Skrtel, and I also think that Emre Can, even though 21, shows a great amount of leadershi and hope he one day can be our Captain.

I Would definatly give Markovic a chance to prove himself, cause im from portugal and i gor to see him a lot of times for Benfica and he was a stand out player for them, he needs to play more to get more confidence.

let's be honest, asking questions about the differences between excluding white people and black people are ridiculous, reductionist and deliberately avoid confronting the historical contexts that make those situations different.

the reason they are different is that black people have been lynched for being found in ""white areas"" across the world. let's just accept that context.

If BR has shown anything this season it's that he's obscenely stubborn, so he may well completely waste the opportunity by continuing to try and force square pegs into round holes, you're right about that.  However, he seems to actually want Benteke, so I'd imagine he'd be more accommodating to him instead of standoffish like he has done with Carroll and Balotelli in the past.  Just look at how long he persisted with Lovren at the start of this season in spite of how shitty he was.  Rodgers also made Danny Graham effective at Swansea, who played a high tempo pressing game and defended off the front under him, and I don't think he's beyond doing it again with a bigger player if it's one of his choosing.  

When I say aggressive referring to Benteke I'm talking about being happy to play facing the goal and running through the channels.  Carroll was bad at that, he didn't really recognize the kinds of spaces and runs that Benteke does.  Balotelli just straight up doesn't do it at all, he will almost always drop deep instead.  This alone is a massive difference in the style of Benteke vs. the other two that really works in his favor when it comes to fitting in with the rest of the squad.  He'll give players like Coutinho a target to play through on the break and help us transition by stretching play which is something that neither Carroll not Balotelli did or do.  Just watch the semi-final against us for a good example, he was always willing to run forward first and take the ball in stride, then look to link up with the players running with and around him.  He didn't try to slow play down, he tried to facilitate the fast transition.  Players like Coutinho, Sterling, Lallana, Ibe, Markovic, etc. do really well when they've got someone to key off of and we weren't able to provide that sort of player for them to work with almost all season.

Agreed.

I also thing legalisation would *lower* the number of users in the long run.

Think about it. Your hardcore/regular users would just carry on using as they've always done, so it doesn't effect them.

You'll have a sizeable percentage of the population who won't do drugs even if they're legal. Again, these won't be affected.

As for the rest of the population, I imagine you'd see an initial increase in the number of people trying it now it's legal. And after that most people would realise that smoking weed etc isn't actually *that* interesting, and they'd leave it alone.

Cyprus joined the EU in May 2004, so that is when your clock would have started.

You resided in the UK for 5 years from May 2004 to May 2009. If you had been exercising treaty rights for the full 5 years, in May 2009 you would automatically have become a permanent resident. You could then have applied for citizenship any time from May 2010 to March 2013.

Permanent residence is lost when one leaves the UK permanently, or for more than 2 years. You have been outside the UK from March 2013, however you returned briefly in October 2013 which reset the 2 year clock.

Note that if your husband was supporting you, then it becomes complicated unless he had his own visa for the UK and not an EEA family permit based on your marriage. Because to qualify for an EEA family permit you must have been supporting him, but not if you already had permanent residence.

So basically if there was a 5 year continuous period when you can prove were exercising treaty rights before March 2013, then you became a permanent resident after those 5 years. You will lose this status if you don't return to the UK to live before October 2015.

1) His release clause

What ever happens, we can get £32.5m for him (if that is his clause) which would make him the most expensive Belgian player EVER. Sherwood had the right approach of saying ""Why move to Liverpool/Spurs now, when one more good season will have CL clubs calling"" Especially when you look at the forwards in some of the big clubs and there are potentially going to be a few looking for long term replacements.


2) It shows that we as a club can play ball

We can keep players, we know what they're worth and, most importantly, we know how good they are. Selling Benteke to a Europa League team just sends out the message that we'll just sell our best players to any old team. If we only sell to a top team this could influence players to come to us, as they know we'll show them the respect their play/ability deserves and fight to retain their services, getting us and them the best deal.


3) Competition

At this point in time we can not compete with some of the clubs we SHOULD be competing with. We have very little to attract players in terms of wage structure, stability in the league, location, European competition and a relatively unknown quantity as a manager.

IMHO there are two main things driving the creation of our own domestic radicals, the first being the fact that most are second or third generation immigrants. It's quite common for such people to feel a drive to learn more about their original culture. No different from people in North America claiming to hail from the old country really, all pretty harmless. Learning about ""your roots"" is a cliché the world over. 

Things get messy when those roots are in lands where their home nation is waging war. They begin to feel affinity for those in the old country, some even get angry to the point of supporting rebel groups or resorting to violence themselves. Again, no different from when the IRA received arms, financing and volunteers from North America.

With that in mind, I'm not comfortable with the idea of votes being decided by what you experienced when you're *younger* than 16.  I think that the years of 16 and 17 are the years where you are gaining the perspective necessary to properly inform your voting choices.

All I can say is that the quality of the care he received while in Glan Clwyd was considerably worse than that received at other hospitals and nursing homes before and after his time there. 

He was only there for a short time (two months or so), but in that time we observed a marked decrease in his physical wellbeing (bruising, weakness, thinning at an alarming rate) and his mental wellbeing (losing either the ability or the willingness to talk, sometimes refusing to interact whatsoever, crawling instead of walking). Our concerns were met with what would best be termed brusque dismissal from the medical staff, and were followed up with a false diagnosis from one of the doctors on the ward, which he doggedly stuck to even after four (4!!) doctors from other hospitals, some of which had worked with the patient in question for over a year, voiced dissenting opinions.

Not to mention the environment of the place. I have never visited a nursing home or hospital ward that I would describe as ""lovely"", but Tawelfan...well, let's just say that I've never been so bowled over by such an overwhelming stink of urine.

Tax loopholes aren't necessarily something you can close. For a very easy example imagine you have tax thresholds in a company that increase as your profit increases.

There's no black and white way to close that loophole without deciding everything on a case-by-case basis. Even if everyone knows they're doing something wrong it's very difficult to write the rules in a way that can't be exploited in that manor without hurting people playing by the rules.

Most of the team's attention should be paid to realistic targets.

Cline, Milner, Benteke will make our starting 11 better where we have big holes to fill, just like Can and Lallana did.

I think so, should be fairly hassle free. You need to book National Express in advance, in case you haven't. 

The [Gower peninsula](http://www.enjoygower.com/beaches/beaches01.cfm) is the best place to go for beaches. Some of the best in the UK, I'm a big fan of Llangennith, its excellent for surfing. You'd probably need to get the train to Swansea then a local bus to the beach which could be annoying, its about 45 minutes drive from Cardiff so hopefully you will have a friend with a car, if not Swansea is a good option too, and that's just on the train. Devon and Cornwall are also great but that would need to be a weekend away and I wouldn't attempt it with public transport. 

Have a look at [my supermarket](http://www.mysupermarket.co.uk) it'll help you get an idea of what prices are like in supermarkets, there will also be lots of asian shops where you'll be able to get dal and what not if you can't find the exact one you want in the supermarket.

This has the practical upshot of being both A) Internally consistent, and B) A fascinating way of neatly tidying up gaping plot holes.

For instance, this allows the Doctor's ""half human"" claim in the Paul McGann telemovie to be accurate, but also permits all his other incarnations to have never been half human. When the 7th Doctor regenerated, his timeline landed in a configuration where one of his parents was human - the dramatic change being the result of the surgery interfering with the normal regeneration process. When he went from 8 to 9, though, his timeline snapped back into its more natural position.

Other 8th Doctor fiction frequently emphasizes the apparent contradictions and paradoxes of his existence. Of all the Doctors, he spent much of his tenure tangled up in the structure of time itself, rather than the events which transpire within it.

Pretty much everyone across the spectrum thinks that paying for public services through tax is cheaper than paying for it themselves. So there's a real ""value for your money"" argument to be made on spending on health and education. i.e. we are not spending too much, we are *saving you money* by doing it this way. Cue lots of info comparing with the Unted States, France, everywhere else where it costs more than here.

The ""spending too much"" issue only comes up on transfer payments. People hate transfer payments, apart from the state pension, which everyone gets and which has been going for over a century, so everyone knows someone in their family that has received it.  

That's why there is support for things like the bedroom tax amongst the public. They think, yeah, it's reasonable to ask a single person to move out of a three bed house to save money. Of course the issue of where they would go is another story. But they think *the principle* is sound. Which is why Lab made a strategic mistake banging on an on about it. It affected only a small portion of the population and the rest didn't see what the problem was. They should have shut up about it, waited till they got elected and then quietly repealed it. But banging on about things before you get to power, and setting yourself against public opinion is nuts.

A big part of the transfer payment budget is ""tax credits"". It should have been named ""tax rebates"" even though the recipients get more than they pay in. Language matters. People are fine with tax rebates but not so fine with ""credits"".

Also, people don't much like subsidies for things they don't use. I gawped when I heard that we were sending the Sultan of Brunei a cheque for £250,000 per year because he owns a grouse moor in Scotland. Should grouse moors attract subsidies like this? Why? Can the Sultan of Brunei not afford to look after his property without taxpayer help?

This kind of thing *winds people up*.

P.S. I think the grouse moor subsidy is a Tory innovation. So there should have been plenty of room for Labour to bang on about Tories wasting money. Only Lab somehow painted themselves into a corner where they were defending *all* govt spending, and anyone who said otherwise was evil, which meant they were defending subsidy payments to the Sultan of Brunei.

Personally, I think there are slim chances that BR is fired in January, and I think there are also slim chances BR is fired this summer. I'm afraid, when BR is fired, that Klopp will be elsewhere.

I think BR could prove to be able to consistently do well, but it's not going to be in the immediate future. As /u/rydleo likes to (accurately) point out, the man is very new to management, compared to most of his contemporaries. He will need years to get to Klopp's level and even more to get to Wenger's, et al., if that is going to happen. I think he could get there, I really do. But it won't be in a season or two.

Also, if it was TEFL you were thinking of, partner wasn't up for Japan so we considered South Korea for a while there; have only just decided to skip it and go straight to Spain. According to a few months' of intensive research, it is still possible to save €600/700 a month in S Korea teaching English, and you only need a bachelor's and a 20-hour TEFL qualification (can be online, and occasionally not required). Market is shrinking somewhat as SK government cutting back on foreign native speakers (foreign to SK, native to English-speaking countries, I mean), but people still posting jobs on some of the forums/Facebook groups. http://www.reddit.com/r/southkorea/search?q=tefl+south+korea

Hangul would be enough, from research, to get you around major cities; plenty of ex-pats too. 

Anyway, just thought I'd share all that with you in case it was of interest! (You might not even be thinking of TEFL of course...)

Korea and Japan are not multicultural in the slightest, and both are very successful. Diversity has nothing to do with success. As I've said, I don't think there is an issue with having immigrants, but there needs to be a limit to all immigration, white, black, brown, green,blue - I don't even care. Romanians and Polish people aren't better immigrants than your family/ancestors. I simply don't think we have any more room in the UK. And I don't like multiculturalism. What is wrong with British culture? What does Poland, Pakistan or Romania have that I would want other than food? Nothing. 

Of course I know that right now we are the vast majority, but stats have already showed how rapidly that will change around. And it makes perfect sense. I don't dislike London, I went there last December (2014) and had a great time. 

Another problem with mass immigration, as I've stated, is that it displaces communities. Part of my family lived in London for about 100 years, and then left after wave after wave of immigrants came. Because none of the Londoners at the time wanted it. Unfortunately, that was down to a racist view point rather than one that was about culture or space.

Which white people and which black people? You can't say context is important but then strip the context.

What I am saying is context does not matter. Sure it can make racism more understandable but it still needs to be condemned in the strongest possible terms. 

You say all discrimination is bad but that if you take into account context, discrimination against whites isn't as bad. But you make no argument as to why this should be true. Saying they are obviously different or that to ignore context is reductionist are vacuous statements. 

To answer your question in say a typical British city I see no difference between a 'white only' space and a 'black only' space. Maybe the context makes a 'black only' space more understandable but they both should be illegal.

That was the gist of your post. That unfair assertion is what I'm responding to. Second time I'm pointing this out to you. Thats the last.

And here's the second (and last) time I'm going to point this out too. **There is no such thing as ""automatic qualification"" by League position. There is no such rule anywhere.**

The FA in England did not encode any such rule. The year previous to Rafa winning, the FA even said that in such an event (English team win CL, but not in top 4), then THEY WOULD send the defending champs back instead of the 4th placed team.

So there was no ""automatic qualification"" to which Everton were entitled.

If it was ""automatic"", then Real Madrid would NOT have gained entry in 2001 (they finished 5th, but won the CL).

It's all just a ""general understanding"" (for want of a better word). And just as ""top 4 make it through"" is understood, so it was also equally understood that ""defending champs make it through, regardless"".

UEFA knew that. The Spanish FA knew that in 2000. The English FA knew that in 2004.

Everton getting in was just the English FA dishonestly exploiting a purposefully-left-behind loophole (for reasons already explained), reneging on a generally-understood-gentlemens-agreement (which they themselves had previously publically upheld).

**So, by the rules (written and unwritten) that everyone was playing by on May, 2005 - Rafa HAD qualified Liverpool for the 06 CL. And so, good on him. End of story.**

Evertonians can say different. Liverpool supporters ought to know better - it was all explained and discussed in excruciating detail AT THE TIME (if you were there, you would have known better).",null,0,null,1432932403,null,0,false,0,crp8qcs,null,t3_37l4aq,null,t1_crp8qcs,null,t1_crodx84,null,null,null,1433381423,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

How have you come to this conclusion?

There are a wide range of factors that could be the reason for girls performing better at a young age, yet you have suddenly made this sweeping judgement, that the system is 'tailored' towards girls. Really?

How do you think it is tailored towards girls, exactly?

I mean here are a list of things it could possible be down to:

- Girls develop quicker physically than boys, as on average they start and finish puberty a couple of years sooner than boys IIRC. It could be that they also develop quicker mentally, but that it levels out when they reach a certain age.

- Men and women are not the same, both physically and mentally. It could be that boys are generally more likely to have certain personality traits than girls which makes them perform worse. Things such as boys less likely to do their homework than girls or more likely to cause disruption in class, and being more likely to dislike and confront authority, really has nothing to do with the education favouring girls over boys, does it?

There are probably others I can't be bothered to think of. But to just assume that we have made a education system specifically tailored towards girls at boys' expense is just daft.

It's just as silly as the idea that you can't print flyers for a rave without being a raver. This premise is just utterly absurd. Try to understand the concept and not just the poor examples that I'm giving.

Whether or not they served him before or after has no baring. It doesn't absolve them of breaking the law. They offer a service to manufacture custom cakes. They refused to provide this publicly advertised service to him specifically, while still offering the service to other customers with different slogans.

With the basis that their main defense is junk, you have to ask why then did they *really* refuse the order? Again, the facts from the [summary judgement](https://www.courtsni.gov.uk/en-GB/Judicial%20Decisions/SummaryJudgments/Documents/Court%20Delivers%20Judgment%20in%20Ashers%20Bakery%20Case/j_j_Summary%20of%20judgment%20-%20Ashers%20Bakery.htm):

 * They accepted the order when he attempted to place it. They provided no terms and conditions.
 * It is not a large leap of logic to form the perception that the plaintiff was gay, based on the simple fact that he was ordering a cake with a ""support gay marriage"" slogan, and the defendants were aware that he worked for a LBGT support group. Again - remember that discrimination law is based on **perception**. Whether or not he actually was gay is irrelevant.
 * Initially, Mr McArthur was fully willing to make the cake.
 * Ms McArthur convinced Mr McArthur not to make it over a period of a couple of days.
 * Ms McArthur testified to the court that they knew this would probably cause litigation. *This is incredibly important* - she basically admitted that they knew that they were in all likelihood committing discrimination.

One of Judge Brownlee's statements on this is as follows:
&gt; Same sex marriage is inextricably linked to sexual relations between same sex couples which is a union of persons having a particular sexual orientation.  The plaintiff did not share the particular religious and political opinion which confines marriage to heterosexual orientation.  The defendants are not a religious organisation; they are conducting a business for profit and, notwithstanding their genuine religious beliefs, there are no exceptions available under the 2006 Regulations which apply to this case and the Legislature, after appropriate consultation and consideration, has determined what the law should be.

In another paragraph she stated:

&gt; I am satisfied that the defendants would have completed the order [if the plaintiff had chosen graphics which said “support heterosexual marriage” or “support marriage”] and would have had every right to do so.  It is for the reason that the defendants objected to the word “gay” as they are totally opposed to same sex marriage which they regard as sinful that they refused the order.

In plain language - Discrimination against same-sex marriage requires discrimination against sexual orientation. Discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation is illegal. The law does not provide any exception for a commercial entity to discriminate. 

In order for Asher's to successfully appeal against this, another judge to somehow determine that gay marriage is not linked to gay people, or that discrimination against same-sex marriage is not discrimination against same-sex couples.  They could try for the political angle on this - but then political beliefs and affiliations are a protected class too. Their only other hope is for them to convince the government to overturn the Equality Act or implement something like the Conscience Clause - either one of which being a complete disaster for everyone. 

Don't get me wrong - I think the whole thing sounds pretty ridiculous - gay cake discrimination. However the law has to be applied equally to all, and we can't make exceptions just because they are a cake shop, as silly as the whole thing is. That's Equality.",null,0,null,1432933222,null,0,false,0,crp98t0,null,t3_37kvld,null,t1_crp98t0,null,t1_crp4nne,null,null,null,1433381666,null,2,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,2,null

**But my main point is this. Those who praise Mourinho, and in the next breath dismiss Rafa as ""overly defensive"" are being somewhat dishonest.**

In comparison to Mourinho over the years, Rafa is FAR from defensive.

And in comparison to Mourinho over the years, I'd say Rafa is just as successful if you take their respective (net!) budgets into account.

And not just net spending. On 3 occasions (Chelsea twice, and Real Madrid), Mourinho inherited a squad which already had massive amounts of money lavished upon it.

Rafa hasn't had these luxuries.

I reckon the real reason for so much antipathy against Rafa in England is because, deep down, many people know that HE was one fellow capable of getting Liverpool back up to the very top.

It may be hard for new supporters to understand this, but there is deep-seated anatagonism against Liverpool in the press, other clubs, etc. Born partly out of the anti-Scouser thing, and also out of decades of living under Liverpool's shadow.

Rodgers never had that against him, partly because I reckon most people didn't really think he is the kind of chap able to sustain a long term push towards dominance.

Rafa has the kind of cold-hearted ruthlessness that leads to you to believe that once he cracks the formula for getting to the top in a particular country, he will stay there for a VERY long time.

[Kovacic is a versatile midfielder capable of playing numerous roles whether it be as an attacking midfielder, box-to-box player or in the holding role.](http://mlsgb.com/2015/05/29/liverpool-closing-in-on-18m-rated-arsenal-target-as-gerrard-replacement/)  
  
There's no reason to belabor this point. The idea is that BR will play him out of position. That's the joke.

They're good if you aren't drinking to get drunk but just looking for a pleasant place to hang out. Or just take a picnic or a disposable barbeque and hang out on the Meadows. It's also a good city for walking around at night - the centre is quite safe, and we get stunning sunsets. 

We've got a fantastic museum on Chamber Street and excellent galleries on Princes Street (National) and Queen Street (Portrait). They're all free, you only have to pay to get into the temporary exhibitions. There's the Edinburgh International Climbing Centre on the outskirts of the city if you fancy something like the aerial assault course. There are all the ghost tours if you like a bit of a scare (City of the Dead is the best of the bunch). If you like unusual historical sites there's Gilmerton Cove. If nature is your jam, go to Cramond where you'll find Roman ruins, a beautiful walk along the River Almond, and the causeway leading out to Cramond Island (remember to check the tides). 

You might also want to wander out to South Queensferry and check out the bridges - it's a very short train journey or about 45 minutes by bus. Great views, iconic bridge, and there's a nice Italian restaurant that I can never remember the name of overlooking the water. If you're feeling adventurous, sail out to Inchcolm Island and see the abbey ruins. 

If you're up for exploring beyond Edinburgh, St Andrews is worth visiting. You get the train to Leuchars and then a bus the rest of the way. It's a small place, you can easily get round it in a day, but it has castle and cathedral ruins, lots of beautiful old buildings, good cafes (I recommend Brambles if it's still there) and dramatic coastline. Or for a shorter jaunt, wander out to Linlithgow and see where Mary, Queen of Scots was born.

What?

&gt;Pretty sure they told their backers to fuck off after they'd captured the oil fields and a few weapons caches. Like I said they burn bridges and aren't good at making friends which is political suicide.

So you disagree with say the Rand group, the Economist and so on, that they are still receiving foriegn funding. Hell, the turkey security agency story that broke today.

What is that exactly?

&gt;They don't have any allies. They'll implode or lose a border war and then cascade fail into obscurity. The nation states proved you can't be expansive without allies and political agreements.

So you concede at least then that they'll be a proper nation state for some time 'untill'.

Not that I don't find your 'untill' convincing.  What fractions and nations are we talking here?

&gt;Which has been possible since forever. 

Well since the invention of automatic weapons.. None the less, the obvious problem here is that the ability to do so does not translate to a modus operandi. Which ISIS do have. 

And your argument is that 'well big war going on, can't run an episonage agency and do strikes in that situation'.

Really, Why? You keep stating this as plausible behind all this 'well its a war you know, busy work that'. 

Yes, yet nations throughout history have found time for asymetric warfare and/or covert operations. 

How is this a counter point?

&gt;Which just hastens their doom. The better they do the sooner their neighbours take the threat more seriously and just exterminate them.

As above, which neighbours, who, how and when? Also in some pertienant cases like Turkey the question is why? 

&gt;Nothing more than we already have faced in the past century. Like I said I think going back to the nation states plays into the hands of our security services because it narrows the field.

Well in the past centuary British cities were bombed every night for 140 days then on off for 4 more years. How is this a counter argument my particular point here. Brixton might only face two men running around shooting people who an afternoon, thats far less than a night of bombing by the luffwaffe?

null,false,lossaysswag,lfc12,,null,"&gt; How about they've increased the value from £237m to over £600m?

By paying off debt (spending money), investing in stadium expansion and players (spending more money), and bringing in additional sponsorships. You mean they should show their real intent by decreasing the value of the club?  How is this damning evidence? 

&gt; How about the fact the club has won 1 trophy in 6 years since they took over?

You really are going to fault that on them when they had the miserable excuse for a team that existed before them to rebuild?  First of all, they took over at the end of 2010, so it's been slightly less than 5 years.  How many trophies have Arsenal and City won in that 5 years?  I'll give you a hint, not many more than one.  That's a testament to how difficult it is to consistently win trophies in the premier league.  Furthermore, for the first two or three years of this period, we weren't even remotely close to competitive and they had to significantly turn around Liverpool's finances to even begin getting us in shape to start challenging.

&gt; How about cutting the wage bill by more than half in the past 4 years?

Yes, because we had players like Downing and Joe Cole earning way more than they deserved.  How is making prudent business decisions while paying players who actually deserve high wages what they're worth a bad thing?

&gt; How about the little money they've actually invested in the squad? Most players purchased have been because another player was sold.

Yes, and how many of those players *needed* to be sold regardless?  We didn't sell for the sake of having the funds to buy.  Virtually all players sold weren't good enough to play for the team to start. There is also the issue with FFP looming, especially in the early years when the club value was rather low. 

""That ethos is to win. We will invest to succeed. But we will not mortgage the future with risky spending."" - John Henry himself

&gt; How about finishing only once in the top 4 in the past 5 seasons? What happened to the promises of title wins?

FSG came in day one saying that it would be a rebuilding process.  Or did you miss that?

""To get this club to where it should be, where it needs to be, is going to be tough. It's going to be a lot of hard work. So it is not going to happen overnight. We are all committed to the long-term future.""

&gt; How about the millions wasted on players?

Yeah, we never see that from other teams interested in winning.  I mean Chelsea, United and City *never* waste money.  *cough* Rodwell, Sinclair, de Bruyne, Salah, Lukaku, Falcao, Torres, Santa Cruz, Javi Garcia, Marin, Bebe, Zhirkov, Schevchenko, Buttner, Anderson, Veron

And the whole calculations required to remove a door, and its actual solution.  I howled. Sonic screwdriver comparison contest. And The Curator. Thankfully, I stayed spoiler-free, so that was an especially excellent surprise. 

Did Moffat change continuity? I suppose so. But to what end? How much? It's not like Gallifrey has come galloping back into the show with a bevy of Time Lords in long skirts and big collars. Based on the 50th, I thought his new storyline was going to be to go out and search for Gallifrey and start a whole new larger world up. Instead, we're back to another arch-villain's long and convoluted revenge plan. Oh, and more Clara. Who should have been gone a loooOOoooOOOng time ago.

My only complaint about the 50th is that I think it's fairly obvious the War Doctor was supposed to be Eccleston, but he was too much of a bummer to participate, so they threw the War Doctor in there to say his lines and do his stuff. 

I know everyone just loves their crabby new Doctor and how dour and unhuggable he is. I know lots of fans hated that the Doctor finally had girlfriends, and was cool, and had a Wonka-like quality. I didn't. The older, crankier Doctors never landed for me when I was younger. They just reminded me of many of the lonely, ill-tempered science teachers I had over the years. With the current Doctor, watching the show feels like homework. I keep waiting for him to turn a corner and show why he even wants to help humanity anymore. But he's too busy being a stodgy grumpy face.

Capaldi is a wonderful actor, and I know he wanted to return to a First Doctor-like demeanor. It's fine. But he's such a buzz-kill, I've kind of stopped rooting for him to win. I haven't even finished the current season.

It's the same as people bemoaning that the Navy used to have hundreds of boats and now has tens (and same with the RAF &amp; aircraft)

But many of those hundreds were little wooden coastal patrol vessels with a machine gun on the front and the aviation equivalent. In terms of capability you *needed* hundreds to match the capability of a single modern warship.

Both of these activities are only possible because of the big asset base they have and it's potential worth.  

If they're forced to sell their asset base for less than market value, they won't be able to raise the cash to build more homes. Best case scenario, this will cause house building (and especially social housing) to slow dramatically or stop. Worst case, banks recall the loans after deciding that the HAs are too risky a bet. I wouldn't be surprised if the cost of borrowing has already gone up for HAs causing less money to be available for house building.  

This is a terrible idea, which will absolutely screw up HAs and house building across the UK if it goes ahead. It won't happen though - the biggest issue is imposing on what a private organisation (albeit a non-profit) must do with its assets. At most there'll be a lite version restricted solely to the ex council properties that were originally transferred over to the HAs.

City have known about Grealish's talents for a while, and were keen on adding the teenager to their academy ranks.

But his breakthrough into Villa's senior side has seen City resurrect their interest.

Etihad Stadium first-team spies have kept close tabs on Grealish in recent weeks - a period in which the attacker has earned rave reviews.

A move for Grealish this summer is unlikely, but City will certainly keep a watchful eye on the Villa academy graduate this year before a potential swoop in 2016.

The provision says: ""A **person** who [...] makes or publishes any false statement of fact in relation to **the candidate’s** personal character or conduct..."" The person in question and the candidate in question are clearly intended to be different people. Otherwise it would say ""candidate"" both times or ""person"" both times. Different terminology doesn't slip through accidentally, it's intentional. 

Peat Warrior is right to say that that is the only way through for Carmichael's challengers, but it's never (as far as I'm aware) been used in that way before and the language of the statute doesn't indicate that it allows such a claim, so I think that just illustrates how weak any case against him is.

null,false,Cast_Me-Aside,null,null,null,"&gt;My contract this year pays 30K gross salary, but i get a housing allowance ontop which in the end (put together) gives me an overall income of 50K

They give you either a lump sum, or they pay you 1/12th of the total per month, right?

S. 72 of the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 (ITEPA) states that if a sum paid falls within Ch. 3 of Part 3 of the Act it is treated as earnings.  (If it's treated as earnings, it gets taxed as...  Well, as earnings!)

S. 71(1) of ITEPA provides that Ch. 3 applies if a sum is paid in respect of expenses ""I get a housing allowance"", and is so paid by reason of the employment  ""My contract this year pays 30K gross salary, but i get a housing allowance ontop"".

&gt;Are special allowances like housing allowances taken into consideration with housing benefits or is it simply pure salary based?

It's in no way a special allowance.  It's what in the tax world we call a *general allowance*, since it's really just extra money.  It's liable to tax and NICs.  Your total earnings will take you well over the threshold where you can claim housing benefit, without committing fraud.

&gt;in case above is a negative: would it be morally correct to apply for housing benefit and would i risk of haveing subsequent negative repurcussions?

In the UK benefits claimants are demonised as being scrounging, good for nothing scum.  Not universally, unless you read a red-top newspaper, but pretty commonly.  I don't imagine the people you know and work with would be particularly impressed at learning you were paid £50,000 and tried to claim benefits on top.

More importantly however, once they are helped into employment, they will become bigger consumers and thus a greater net good for the economy.

Meanwhile in the alternative, these people die due to starvation and lack of shelter. This drastically reduces the pool of potential consumers. The economy thus stagnates as there are less people for, say Tesco, to flog their goods.

Not everyone on benefits is a write off in terms of being a potential worker, and indeed if the welfare and JobSeeker's system actually tried to help people rather than demonise them, they'd be a greater net good in the long-term.

Will you be camping / staying in [bothies](http://www.mountainbothies.org.uk/) on the way, or will you crash in the various hostels / B&amp;B's / hotels instead? These questions will help define your packing, equipment and strategy. As others have stated, Scotland can have some harsh weather in no matter what time of year you visit.

In April I have experienced the warmest time I have ever been walking (almost 28C on Ben Nevis), as well as the wettest camping experience of my life so prepare for all and expect the opposite.

Good, it's these kinds of issues that separate liberalism from the other parties and it's these kinds of issues that liberals need to be vocal and build a campaign on. The LibDems shouldn't be talking about how much we're going to spend on short term (but necessary) stopgap measures like welfare, we should be talking about how we're going to *solve* problems of poverty and income inequality - welfare is important but it is not a solution, it does not help it just placates. We should be a party of choice, of competition, and of opportunity and we should ask do our policies strengthen these three pillars at every juncture. The focus should not be on subsiding the poor, but on pushing them up to something greater with structural reform and targeted investments. Our message needs to be not that we're going to cut or increase your benefits, but that after 5 years of a Liberal government you won't require benefits. 

We need to be a party with a central message, a party of action and solutions and not of protest. The Liberal Democrats have in the past been a party of the antis, that largely increases its support not by its own merits but by the mistakes of its competitors. Being a party of protest might get us back to 23% but it would eliminate us as a party of Government and forsake the last five years. I would much rather be  a party of principles and of solutions that builds its support from the ground up based on merit and good policy than a party of popular protest. 

The LibDems need to stand on their own not as a party of the right or the left, not as a party of big business or welfare, but as a party of competition, opportunity and choice; A party of sound economic policy and of helping people to help themselves.  We need to attract business by emphasising competition and opportunity, and attract the poor by subsidising their improvement.

On one side you have a government with multiple agencies, thousands of employees and millions upon millions of records- keeping records is what states do. On the other side you had a reasonably tight knit group who were only accountable to themselves, and thus had no reason to keep records except for their own purposes- if they kept any formal records at all. This means that the vast majority of dirt that would be dug up by an all seeing commission would be from the British side. The implication being that this difference would allow the republican side to whitewash the narrative of the troubles. 


You cannot be serious. You don't want the truth to come out because it would be asymmetrical. What if i told you quite a large portion of the conflict has already been dealt with.

Gives you unlimited travel on all operators, trains and the Metro in that area.

It'd probably be best to try and work out what you're going to use a pass for - if you're going to spend your weekends and evenings at home or not going out much, then a NX Buss pass would be more than adequate. If you're going to be making extensive use of the travel network, or don't want to be limited or have to find cash for random trips on the train, the N-Network passes are the ones to go for.

We demand politicians who are experienced, polished, ""normal"" (by some bizarre standard under which Boris Johnson is more ""normal"" than Ed Miliband), we want them to have an encyclopaedic knowledge of their party's policies, we don't want them to have any embarrassing history, and yet we also want them to have jumped into politics on a whim after building a successful career in a completely unrelated industry.  Why are we surprised that so few people fit those requirements?  And many of the same people who whine about ""career politicians"" think the royal family and the hereditary peers are fantastic, since they have spent their whole lives preparing for their roles.  Nobody suggests that the queen needs to know what the price of milk is, or that the Seventeenth Earl of Toffbury should have become a surgeon before taking up his daddy's seat in the Lords.",null,0,null,1432951263,null,0,false,0,crpinio,null,t3_37mbck,null,t1_crpinio,null,t1_cro91i2,null,null,null,1433386170,null,2,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,2,null

&gt;The bane of leftist Germans, the Springer newspapers were outrageously conservative. Owned by Lord Axel Springer, the Springer Press controlled almost half of the newspaper circulation in West Germany. Springer was an avowed anti-communist. During a time when others corporations were leaving West Berlin in droves (fearful of the tenuous political situation that barely kept the city out of East German hands), Axel Springer chose to put the headquarters for his publishing empire in Berlin. Springer built a 20-story monstrosity mere yards away from the Berlin Wall (and a block or so away from Checkpoint Charlie), and put a huge reader-board on the side facing East Berlin. The board would flash the news of the free world to the “enslaved Germans” on the other side of the wall. The sheer size of the building was intended as a constant reminder to East Germans of the superiority of the Capitalist system. The Baader-Meinhof Gang bombed the Springer building in Hamburg in May of 1970, injuring 17 workers.

I argue that meta-analysis of the scientific method is 100% scientific.

Yes, intuition can encourage people to examine certain things. However, it cannot be treated as a premise. So, for example, intuition could encourage a scientist to look into whether the reasons for behavioural differences between genders is genetic or environmental in nature. Intuition sparking curiosity and thorough scientific examination of an observed phenomenon, like your example of the apple, is very much scientific. However, assuming that something is the case without rigorous scientific proof of it is very much not scientific. It may be correct and it may not be, but either way it is unscientific.

&gt;Okay not hypothesis, results; bacteria+food is 100% linked to specific smells.

And that is very much my point. Because two things were apparently linked, people assumed one caused the other. However, it turned out that was not the case.

&gt;My argument is focused on the fact that this is the case, means that resources should only be applied to lines of study which have ""potential"" i.e. an intuitive basis.

I think we might be in violent agreement here. While I think we need to assume that genetic factors are not responsible for behavioural differences between genders at this point in time, I also think that it is an area that merits further study. We still understand very little about our brains, and anything we can do to understand them better would be good.

The only issue is, all of the studies so far looking to establish behavioural differences between genders have been unable to separate environmental factors from biological ones, meaning that we have not been able to gather any data that could possibly disprove the null hypothesis. Perhaps when our understanding of neural networking improves to the point where we are able to project specific and detailed neurological growth patterns based on static stimuli, we might be able to design a study that would be able to prove a causal link between gender and behavioural differences, but until then, there's not much we can do.",null,0,null,1432956462,null,0,false,0,crpl40k,null,t3_37plnw,null,t1_crpl40k,null,t1_crpksbw,null,null,null,1433387398,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null
