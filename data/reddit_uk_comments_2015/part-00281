As of today, and for at least another season, Rangers are a full division below Inverness CT, Ross County and Partick Thistle.

Last season, they finished **24** points behind Hearts, who this time last year were - lets face it - completely fucked.

They also finished 4 points behind Hibs who had completely imploded the season before.

They're still paying (at least) 2 managers who don't work for them any more, and the insinuation in the article that buying 21,500 season tickets means supporters are 'stepping up' is laughable. I've been at Hearts games at Ibrox where there were double that number in season ticket holders alone.

They've been overspending on players and staff since Murray took over in the 80s, and they're continuing to do so today (albeit on a lesser scale due to, you know, being bankrupt)

If it only has a half dozen or less shows worth watching people will just torrent those instead, or use a proxy to view them which is what the article is about in the first place. Reruns of our own shows do not fit the bill, nor do 80's and 90's action movies that were cheap to license rights to in order to fill half the broadcast day or more.

Yup. You are the outlier. The average person travels intercity perhaps once or twice a year, to see relatives or attend weddings. And they prefer travelling by car, more comfortable, more leg-room, more privacy, ability to listen to the music you want during the journey etc. Almost all other journeys are *within* cities, and the poorest make those by bus.

Only the business class *need* to commute intercity. *THINK* about what jobs need you to travel frequently - only executive ones, and only because corporations like having their high level meetings in London (I speak from experience here).

So cutting the fares will just help that group and no other. And choosing to indulge the commuter class *will* require some other group to get short shrift. The cost of this is colossal.

The forwards, in this offense, need to press, be able to play a tight pass and be interchangeable.  

Mario can press at times and, in fairness to him, he did add it to his game.  He also learned to defend on set pieces something he said he had never done before.  

But he is not good enough at those tight little one-two passes that can unlock a defense.  Not in the slightest.  

Tactically he sometimes, randomly, drifts out wide leaving no one as the focal point of the attack.  He is offsides way too often.  

While that one game when Sturridge and Mario looked good together, there is more evidence that was the exception rather than the norm.  

It is not his second chance it is his fifth or sixth.  Every club he goes to he doesn't stay there for more than a year or two.

Even with Borini/Lambert/Balotelli out on loan or sold we've a pretty huge squad so there'll be lots of rotation to give players rest. Europa cup will be used to blood youth players and some occasional first teamers who need game time. First team players will be left at home.

Midfield will change between a 1-2 pivot and a 2-1 pivot based on the opposition. Against stronger teams Lucas/Can/Allen will be the 1, and Milner and Henderson the 2. Against weaker teams Henderson&amp;Milner will be the two and Coutinho/Lallana the 1. Can and Allen (and possibly Lallana) can give Henderson or Milner an occasional rest as needed. Rossiter and Ojo to get Europa game time if not sent out on loan. 

Up front Benteke will start at 9, with Ings and Origi pretty evenly matched backups. Whatever we can get from Sturridge will be a bonus. We'll probably change between a two wide and one central, and two central and one in behind depending on who we're playing. Benteke and Firmino as the two, Coutinho as the 1, or Coutinho and Firmino both wide(ish). All 3 will be expected to press hard, so the backups of Lallana, Markovic, Ibe, Origi, Ings, Teixeira, Sturridge will get plenty of chances.

&gt;I hope to have the same path as Lampard and Terry here at Chelsea. They have a great career at the club and are very important for the squad. They are big idols.

&gt;I think I have the quality, I am strong in the mind and good with my feet. If I play my best, I will try to win the Player of the Year. The manager wants me to play like Eden did and at the top level all the season.

The issue is driver inattention, lack of training, influence of.drink or.drugs, inexperience, old.age, all these factors and more that can combine to turn a car and driver into a killing machine. 

A black box doesn't even begin to cut it.

Cheltenham is a desirable place to live in Gloucestershire.  It attracts a lot of investment, and [has several schools with a good reputation](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-30991185) (GCSE results at numbers 1, 24 and 62 respectively in 2014). [The University](http://www.theguardian.com/education/ng-interactive/2015/may/25/university-league-tables-2016) has risen 20 places to 54 in the 2016 league tables, and charges £9k p.a. fees.  Many people who work here live nearby in places such as Longlevens and Churchdown.  Others whom I know commute in from Winchcombe, Gloucester and some as far as Stow and Cirencester.

It holds the largest public and private sector employers in the county.  The many festivals that are held here - Food, Music, Jazz, Literature, Science - as well as the Gold Cup in March and other racing engagements, attract over a million people to the town annually.

Cheltenham is situated close to the M5, which makes access to Birmingham, Bristol and Cardiff straightforward.  The road and rail systems also have regular passage through to London in 2-3 hours.

If he is to stay though, Rodgers should be thinking of sending Origi out on loan for the first half of the season (or the second). Assuming Borini and Lambert are off, and if Balo stays, Origi will be far down the pecking order. 

Again: there's absolutely no point in letting Balotelli stay if he's not going to play. It makes more sense to loan him out and increase his value than to have him rot on the bench.

What he has going for him the coming season is the fact that Rodgers seems to be thinking of a 4-3-3 or a 4-4-2 diamond. The pre season games have looked like Rodgers is looking like a system. And the fact that some players keep returning to the same positions makes me believe that he's trying to find his starting XI during the tour. Henderson and Milner will definitely be starting together in the middle, in front of either Allen or Lucas.

In front of them though, Rodgers has played with both a diamond tip and two strikers and with a front three. Both of those would fit Balotelli better than a 4-3-3 with Sterling and Lallana on the sides.

If we keep playing a diamond during the season, Balotelli will get the chance to actually play with another striker. And I think he'd do well together with an Ings or a Sturridge.

null,false,tabelz,num1,,null,"&gt;What do you think of our dealings so far?

Top notch. Toby's a proven defender in the league, didn't cost too much and has experience with Jan. Wimmer seems solid and was cheap and has lots of room to grow. Trippier seems alright, but I don't know enough about him. Gives Walker some solid competition. Great sales, obviously. Considering the cash we got for Capoue, Benji, Paulinho, Kaboul I'm pleased. Work to do, but the signings seem very responsible and the sales are vintage Levy. 

&gt;What positions still need to be looked at?

A CM for sure. Preferably someone to partner with Bentaleb. I'm not sold on Dembele and no squad that plays Mason every week should expect to finish top 4. I like him but he has to grow. A CAM would be nice, but I've heard Pritchard might back up Eriksen and Windy likes Pritchard so I'll be cool with that. Someone to take off Eriksen's workload because he got tired. I'd like a winger who can also play up front. A striker ideally if we can move the other 2 not named Harry.

&gt;Do you have any realistic suggestions for those positions?

I like the idea of Berahino I guess, but I'm not knowledgable enough of the market so I can't make a rational suggestion. 

&gt;Should we look to sell anyone else?

Adebayor. Soldado, probably. Demebele if we can get a good CM.


&gt;What do you think our best XI is currently?

Lloris; Rose, Vert, Toby, Trippier; Bentaleb, Dembele (?); Chadli, Eriksen, Lamela; Kane

&gt;Who do you think will improve on their last season?

Trendy pick but Lamela. Bentaleb could look even better too I think, we haven't seen his ceiling and I'm excited to see what it is. I think Dier could look good too if we experiment with how we play him. Rumors of CM could make it interesting considering he's played it in Portugal. 

&gt;Do you think anyone will regress?


Well....there's the Kane question, but I think we've seen enough to know that he's the real deal. I think Eriksen could regress, but if he gets enough rest and a solid rotation player behind him he can still be brilliant.

Rodgers wants Liverpool to press. Liverpool has a host of midfielders better at pressing than they are at holding positions and containing. Balotelli does not press.

Balotelli's playing style is a striker playing as a midfielder - drop deep, supply others. Shoot from distance instead of getting into the box. But we don't need that. We have a lot of creators, and they're more creative than Balotelli. We need players getting into the box. We need movement for midfielders to provide to. Balotelli does not offer what we need.

Benteke has a better record than Balotelli in the PL. Sturridge has a better record than Balotelli in the PL. Even if you exclude last season because poor Balotelli wasn't used right, those two still have better records than Balotelli in the PL.

So for the fairy pools in particular: we have been wildcamping. There was a carpark just a little further up with big patches of grass. A lot of people must have done the same as there were traces of firepits. Unfortunately for us, with 5 days of rain in a row, we were unable to find dry wood and couldn't start our fire.

It would have been really helpful though as I've never seen so many midges as this year (it was our 4th time in the highlands). As long as you're walking it's no trouble but as soon as you stop they come biting. Often we took refuge in our tent and played cards.

For reals? this is the news source you want to use to defend your position? Lol, they are so clearly bias and politically warped.

Now, I don't think there is anything special about being Jewish, I certainly am not Jewish myself. Israel also is a larger group than Jews and its clear you can't separate the two. Lets face some fact though shall we?

Israel is the only country in the middle east with strong support, and actually legalized to some degree (not entirely thought, yet), of same sex couples.

Israel by a large margin in the best country in the Mid East for woman's rights.

Israel was the only country to be ranked as free by Freedom House's ranking of democracy in the Mid East until 2015, now only Tunisia has joined Israel in being ranked free. (Go Tunisia!)

Gaza is ruled by an Islamic fascist junta that have said in their charter that they wish to wipe the Jews out. They also use kids as human shields and then parade their bodies in front of the worlds cameras. They hide missiles next to schools and hospitals, they are deplorable in every sense and should not be given an inch.

The west bank is ruled by corrupt, terrorist supporting holocaust denier. He is also suspected of providing funds for the Munich massacre.

Its really quite simple, you either support human rights and Israel, or you support Islamic terrorists. Personally, I'd rather hang out in Tel Aviv over just about any other place in the middle east, same goes for my wife.

You either support human rights OR you support the likes of Israel and Islamic terrorists.. because they are essentially one and the same - tiresome 'them' and 'us' fallacy.

&gt; PS: Screw the 46 borders, the surrounding countries invaded and lost. You do not get to keep the land when you launch an invasion and lose. That just how the world works.

Israel was a mistake. Move those who can't just get along with others, over to Texas and be done with it.

It's not that we are too stubborn and proud, its the cost of doing it.              
Take any small street in a town or city on google maps then widen the road. About 99% of the time to widen the road you have to either remove the pavement which increase the risk to pedestrians or do serious work the the buildings along the roads.                    
Most modern cities which have great road infrastructure were built after the invention of motorvehicles or had a big disaster which let them rebuild as they wanted.                 
Most cities and towns in the UK date back a 1000+ years and outside of war or fire haven't been changed a lot in the last few hundred years.              
                  
Yes if the road widening required knocking down historic buildings people would complain, but in general its the cost.

Why? Because you think that faction is unelectable? Or because you disagree with their stance? Do you think their policies will be shit? Do you fear the media backlash?

&gt; ...they did vote for an opposition amendment but abstained...

Truncated. This seems simplistic for me. If the ""rebels"" are to be believed more MPs disagreed with the bill than the votes would suggest. As it is, 1/5 of the MPs *did* vote, a substantial number, you have to agree. The abstentions may have been down to having some things worth keeping in the bill, but an opposition party should have tried much, much harder to oppose a vastly unfair (on balance) bill that will hinder more families than it will help. Plenty of opportunities? Relying on the Lords to block it is fudging the issue and fobbing responsibility off on someone else.

&gt;It has proven very uncomfortable for the party.

Of course. Many, if not most, party members wholeheartedly disagree with the bill.

&gt;If they wanted a comfort zone, they'd have voted against it whether or not it was a good idea.

Rubbish. There were very good reasons for voting against it. The only reason for abstaining was that they didn't want to accept any responsibility. It highlights how little stomach for the fight is currently on show by the MPs. By abstaining Harman wanted to remain in the comfort zone, but it has incensed the party members and made life much harder than Harman *et al* could have possibly realised at the time. It's a rejection, by the membership, of a comfort zone, one that you currently deny exists.

Spineless, fuzzy logic such as that on display by Harman, and the failure to oppose by Burnham, Cooper and Kendall are why Corbyn is gaining popularity. However much you dislike him or his politics he is the only candidate who appeals to the mob at the moment. If one of the other three actually found a backbone he or she might gain some support, but all the while they sit back and allow Harman to drift towards an early retirement then they are all the more likely to spend the rest of their careers on the backbenches.",null,0,null,1437641189,null,0,false,0,ctd5wr5,null,t3_3e6enm,null,t1_ctd5wr5,null,t1_ctd5lwj,null,null,null,1438115935,null,1,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,1,null

I wonder if we are talking about different comfort zones. There seems to be a bit of a gap in comfort zones between the grass roots and the Parliamentary party.

You've not said where you're based but here in London there are groups aimed at various coders. Going to those helped make contacts.

By far the best thing to do if you have the money around is one of the many learn to code courses - these cost ~10k but are known by some employers to get people to a good enough level. I went alone and taught myself by subscribing to treehouse and learning Ruby, but if I was to do it again I'd seriously consider wegotcoders - even if it meant a loan, they have a history of employing people who complete their course themselves as an agency with the work guaranteed by the seniors in the group whilst students gain experience.

The first step is to visit somewhere like codecademy and try basic coding for free - no point in attempting to learn it if you dont enjoy it or just don't have the correct skill set to do it well.

As for getting that first job, after 6 months I started looking for positions and by 7-9 months had some very near misses (one company offered me a job but then got bought the same week and the dev team eventually made redundant, another already had someone in mind for the position but attempted to open up another one to let me in).

null,false,AnxiousMo-Fo,,"Yvette, Stella, Tessa",null,"As I've pointed out before, the public will agree with policies in abstract that they don't agree with when presented to them in bulk and/or as the policy of a particular party.

The Tories found this out after 2005, when they ran on a platform which, they were told, was very, very popular, but that people shied away from when they saw them all under one heading and even more so when that heading was 'Conservative Manifesto'. Suddenly, policies they approved of were seen as 'nasty', 'mean', 'selfish', etc.: The negatives associated with the word 'Tory' all came out.

A similar thing happened with us in May, where our policies (Mansion Tax, energy price freeze) were popular but *we* weren't. In our case, our policies were popular but played into all *our* negatives: 'Idealistic', 'anti-business', etc.

There's also what I think of as the 'venn diagram fallacy', which is to assume that there's overlap between approval of policies. For example, it's quite easy to find polls showing the decriminalisation of marijuana is 'popular' and other polls showing that bringing back the death penalty is 'popular'. But if a party ran with both those  in their manifesto, they'd lose. Why? Because the number of people who support *both* those policies is vanishingly small, whereas the number of people on each side for whom the other policy is a dealbreaker is huge.

I'm not saying that's the case with any or all of the policies in the article, I'm just providing further evidence that 'popular' does not equal 'general election victory'. This is one of the reasons why people deride 'populism': It's often cynical and it rarely works.

Finally, people might agree with things but that doesn't mean they'll win votes. Lots of people might shrug and go 'Sure, it'd be nice if rail was nationalised', but that doesn't necessarily mean they'll switch their vote to a party offering that.

So, policy is just one way voters make up their minds, and basing your policy on what people say they want is full of pitfalls.

EDIT: On closer inspection, even if we discounted everything I've written above, some of this article's assertions are so naive as to be actually disingenuous. The public supporting 'an international convention on banning nuclear weapons' is *so not the same* as the public supporting Britain's *unilateral* nuclear disarmament. It is flatly wrong to equate the two.

Additionally, on tuition fees, the polling only shows that the public support a 'cut' in tuition fees; we might suspect (and I do, as it happens) that they'd prefer to eliminate them altgoether, which is Corbyn's position, but that is *not* what this data shows: It could just as well mean that they support them in principle ('Why shouldn't people pay their own way?') but think they should be lower ('Who'd want to start out life with *that much* debt?').

null,false,DogShackStudio,,Belfast,null,"So far I only have half of half a sleeve, as in the top half of my outer arm is covered. I still need to get the inside of my arm done. Both of them cost roughly £600, each took 3 sessions that were £200 each. Black and white tends to be cheaper than colored tattoos because they take less time. With colored ones the artist is constantly switching between colors etc so it's a lot more time consuming that straight black and white. 

To give you a very rough estimate I would need to know a few things. Are you going full sleeve? Also what sort of tattoo is it? Images etc. that require a lot of shading are going to take much longer than something like a tribal tattoo that is just drawing and filling in black lines. If you are going for a really detailed full sleeve I would imagine it will cost anywhere between £1500-2000. You only pay per session and have to wait 4 weeks between each so it would cost maybe 200-300 per month for as long as it takes. If you are short on cash you don't even have to do it each month, you can wait as long as you need between sessions to get the money up.

As I said on the previous comment a tattoo is the last thing you want to cheap out on so it will be expensive. The best thing to do is go down to a place you think is good and talk to them. If the place is willing to give you a set price I would be very skeptical.

Because it's so uttely opposed to the principles of the party and the reasons why it was formed.

&gt;I wonder if we are talking about different comfort zones.

No doubt. If you think that backing Corbyn is a return to an ideological comfort zone then I would counter that by saying the choices and actions that would come from that ideology are anything *but* comfortable. It would be incredibly tough to overturn the decades spent driving a wedge between the haves and have-nots. I think it would be very brave to try and return to the radical politics that drove the post-war growth and social policy, and as dated and old fashioned as that sounds, it is probably the last time that stuff got done for the people as opposed to the private sector.

To my mind calling an ideology a comfort zone is very misleading. To my mind a comfort zone suggests a laziness, practically speaking, that cannot really apply to an ideology. So yeah, I'd go with the latter definition whereas you favour the former. Corbyn's stance is less about going with the flow and not challenging (oneself or others) but more to do with pushing for changes (right or wrong)  and making shit happen. People who roll their sleeves up and get stuff done are less likely to have the words ""comfort zone"" applied to them in the real world.

&gt;I think it's unable to win in the constituencies that Labour needs to win to form the next Government

Fookin' southerners. Fook 'em.

Actually I think Labour have focussed too heavily on those constituencies for too long, which is why the workers feel abandoned, and why a bunch of Labour voters turned out for the Kippers back in May.

...apart from when commenting on stuff he clearly has little knowledge about.

Take XP itself, for example - the key phrase he ignores is '*in some form*'. Lots of councils run thin-clients running XP embedded. The C drive is write disabled, and the device generally acts as a dumb terminal to access Citrix or similar, and apart from that nothing can be run locally *at all*. As a result, these devices aren't nearly as 'at risk' as Graham Clueless seems to think. I haven't seen a council that hasn't upgraded or is in the process of doing so. A lot of them are looking at upgrading Win2003 servers this year, which is a much bigger job.

&gt;They've even stopped updating their free anti-virus product for the platform.

...has anyone ever visited a site of any real size where they were actually using this?

&gt;I am confident they are aware of the issue, and those who have been told by management that there is no budget for switching to a new operating system have done their best to harden systems from attacks

Why I like it:

- I like the way the exterior looks. It's got an interesting shape that gives it character, and I like the combination of the brickwork and chimneys with the more modern white parts.

- The interiors are all spacious, full of natural light, and open plan. High quality finish but not extravagant. I could see myself regularly inviting a good sized number of friends over for dinner/movie night/etc.

- I like the floor plan: it has an entrance hall with a small downstairs bathroom, it has a combined kitchen-diner, but also space for a more formal dining room, it has en suite bathrooms but also a communal bathroom so it's possible to use a shower without passing through someone's bedroom. Little things that I look for.

- Large kitchen area for social cooking and eating. With a kitchen island.

- A good number of large bedrooms and bathrooms, but not too many. Better to have 5 large bedrooms than 8 small ones, I think. I'd probably invite three friends to live with me and leave the smallest bedroom as a guest bedroom.

- Detached, with distance from the neighbours and surrounded by trees, which offers both privacy and allows you to not worry too much about making noise.

- Large garden and a small pool for garden parties/barbecues.

- Off-road parking for multiple cars.

- Within walking distance of an Underground station for access to central London, as well as local shops and conveniences.

- Low crime, attractive neighbourhood with good schools (for when you want to start a family) and a nice park.

Don't give into buy one get one half price or similar offers if it's for something fresh which doesn't last long and can't be frozen as it could go to waste. 

One thing to do is bulk buy, which some people can't afford to do, but you should be able to. Per 100g, buying big bags of dried foods works out cheaper. So buy the biggest bags of food such as rice, pasta and lentils (if you eat them) that the supermarket sells.

&gt;People give a lot of shit out to Osborne but it could be a lot worse.

Yeah, but it could be a whole lot better as well. Ever read Catch-22? Some very bad paraphrasing now:

Nurse Duckett: ""Be grateful you're still alive.""

Yossarian: ""Be furious that you're going to die.""

ND: ""You still have your health.""

Y: ""Be bitter that it won't stay that way.""

ND: ""Things could be worse.""

Y: ""But they could be so much better.""

ND: ""Then what's the point?""

Heller's point in that particular passage was that rolling over and getting the tummy tickled by those that want to hurt us just isn't acceptable. It explains why Yossarian wants to desert the air force, why he feels it acceptable to run away while all his friends and colleagues are getting shot down over Italy. And there's another parallel too: it's Yossarian's odd-looking idiosyncratic tent-mate that escapes the war and lives out his life in peace. And it may be a leap here, but you voted for UKIP for that reason, and it's the same reason I will vote for Corbyn. I will vote for the odd-looking, idiosyncratic candidate who best represents what I want.

Osborne deserves every nugget of crusty poo that falls in his lap. Blair is as deluded as Thatcher was, except he doesn't have dementia as an excuse, just greed. Greece is doing worse because their previous government stole all their money (simplistic but true), and we've already spoken about France. We may be better off than France, but that's currently like saying we're better off than Azerbaijan.

Strange point. I agree, but I don't think anyone was saying that we should keep it illegal so that small time dealers can still earn a living, just that dealers don't want legalisation.

* Sixty nine per cent feel it is ‘very’ or ‘quite’ important that people in Britain are free to get jobs in other European countries

Now if you want my honest belief - I believe the Labour party is unelectable as long as it is seen as the party with utter disdain for its voters. If they refuse to even listen to its members, then how the fuck are they going to listen to the wider electorate. The Labour party is fucked as long as they have people in high positions of power believing the electorate are stupid and therefore whose views should be discarded. The members are an electorate, they may be a smaller electorate but they are large enough that if they say something, the party should listen.

There is no smoke without fire, and the attitudes MPs have regarding the people choosing what they believe is ""the wrong candidate"", reflects the wider issue that Labour is out of touch with the people and had MPs who refuse to get in touch. We can only begin to become electable by dealing with this problem head on.

Do you have any evidence of the state of the property when you moved in? Photographs or an inventory?  If you don't then if it goes to court it comes down to your word against his, so it depends who the judge finds more believable.

Is it possible there were some scratches which have become worse?  

Another question - is the bed provided with the house or is it yours?  It's hard for him to complain about damage caused by his own furniture being used in the normal way.

&gt; The second request about the painting is ridiculous as well

Why is it ridiculous?  Are you saying your kids didn't paint and scratch them?  If they did then he has some grounds to seek compensation since this goes beyond ""normal wear and tear"".  The fact the walls were not pristine to start with doesn't mean that if you or your kids are free to damage them further.  It might effect how much is reasonable to pay.

&gt; Any advice would be very helpful.

In the first instance I'd be inclined to remind him of your conversation re: the bedroom floor and reject that part of the claim outright.

Regarding the painting I'd consider whether in fact he has a point. If he does then you may wish to try and negotiate a compromise.

I never was a massive advocate for weed being legalised here, I didn't really care....until I went to Denver earlier this year. If we could do what they have over there it would solve a LOT of problems.

I went and bough weed from a few places and I never came into contact with any criminals, there were no post apocalyptic scenes of jobless people running around eyes bleeding like something out of 28 days later and I saw ALL kinds of people using the dispensaries. Business people, hipsters, people with medical problems, elderly people, housewives......everyone. 
The dispensaries themselves were slick, clean with great products, informed staff. Nothing sleazy whatsoever.

I'm sure most of you know about the financial implications for their state so I'll just say this. The cannabis industry in America is set to be an 8 Billion dollar buisness by 2017 (yes I know America is a bigger market, but you get the point). Can you imagine what that would mean for the NHS if we legalised it? The Debt that we have? Eductation?

It feels almost childish they haven't tried it here yet. I've signed this petition but feel it won't go far because of the powers that be and their plain stubbornness to move forward, like its a threat to their way of life more than ours.

I have had friends that did it in the past and they said they would charge around £20-30 for their average 15-20 minute fare.  They also know they are not taxi's and are more expensive and a lot slower, instead they try and make a fun experience for the tourists.

Head of sun bathing committee - I'm seeing Bamford here, that hair looks like it doesn't willingly get ruffled. Wilf will be here shortly when he's tired of Jedi making him run about. Obviously chamakh here with Cabaye....

Head of sanitation - Brighty if he went? Stories of the 80s round the camp fire followed by some marigolds and tidying up

Head of catering - Julian Speroni... Eat at his restaurant if you don't believe me. Jedi and Ledley, plus Damo can help with the butchering of lions / gazelles.

Part of the problem (according to one driver who I spoke to) is that most Leeds minicab drivers aren't actually from Leeds. They're typically from Wakefield, Bradford or Keighley but come to work in Leeds because there are more fares - mainly from the student population.

If the police don't have a case to answer, from a strategy/planning perspective then the compliant will be dismissed. If they do, then it will be upheld.

* Riding on the left, throughs a lot of Americans off until you get used to it. Especially on turns.
* Filtering, it's legal here and very much needed
* Understanding the Road Signs and laws. Do you know what the national speed limit is and how to determine what it is for where you are at? Also, do you understand the logistics of navigating roundabouts? There are a lot of them here.
*  You need to be comfortable with wet riding, it rains a lot. Although not as rough as it does in the states it's just a constant drizzle here.
* Depending on what time of year you want to come over you will need warm riding clothes and gloves. Unless you come right about this time of year it's lovely.

If you are dead set on doing the trip, which is great BTW. Then use /r/MotoUK to make some contacts and I would recommend traveling to different areas of the UK by train or plane. Renting a bike and riding around that area of England, preferably with people you meet on /r/MotoUK, and then returning the bike and traveling to your next area. 

If you do the above for at least the first couple of rides people can help introduce you to riding in the UK and the rules of the road and then you can do the later rides by yourself and be much safer. I would recommend Lake District, most of Scotland, Near Snowdonia, New forest, etc as places to look into.

The entryists who are paying £3 with muliple identities to vote in this election are certainly hard left.

Vote for one thing and find you are forcibly being offered something entirely different.

*But what about the 9.3 million who voted Labour in the 2015 general election*. They were voting for what was on the tin, which was a combination of safety-net and soft-austerity that was in the Labour manifesto.

It's a travesty for outside entryists to hijack the party and impose an extreme leftist on them on the grounds that the views of 100,000 entryists are more important than the views of 9.3 million voters.

*You can't trick ordinary voters without getting punished severely*. Look what happened to the LibDems when they pulled that stunt.

Also, beer is pretty cheap. Weed is currently very expensive. A couple of beers after work each night will cost you about £10 a week. A couple of spliffs? More like £60. 

Personally it is only the legal risk that stops me from having one or two plants on the go. With the current prices for good weed I'd imagine this is the same for most regular smokers. Those prices won't get drastically cheaper with legalisation (all that will happen is the added on danger-money becomes the added on tax). If there was no risk I would consider it utterly stupid to spend a couple hundred quid on weed every month when I could spend that once and have essentially free weed forever. 

With tobacco or alcohol the same doesn't apply. I can't create the same product. I can't make Havana #7 in my shed (I think this might actually be illegal (distilling spirits), although I'm not totally sure of that) that will be indistinguishable from the Havana #7 in the shop . I could do that with any strain of cannabis that I could get my hands on, easily.  

&gt; Also I think implying that home grown would necessarily be as good as commercially grown might not be the case for all growers.

I understand the alcohol analogy but you'd probably find that it's often the opposite. Cannabis isn't a hard plant to grow. Shortcuts are very tempting when you're growing commercially. Not so much when you're doing it yourself. Growing it at home you're more likely to take that extra week to flush the chemicals out of it, to take that extra time trimming it properly, to cure it for a proper length of time etc. ",null,0,null,1437648467,null,0,false,0,ctd7p1k,null,t3_3e7n3p,null,t1_ctd7p1k,null,t1_ctd71xw,null,null,null,1438117251,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

I don't think we need a nuclear deterrent because we know we'll never use it, and if we do get to the point of needing to use it, the country's fucked to hell and back, whether we fire them or not, as you said.

Nuclear weapons are simply irrelevant to modern warfare. Look at the middle east. If ever there was an argument for pointing nukes at someone and saying ""Stop, or else"", it's that, but we don't. Why? Because the consequences are utterly unthinkable. You can say we can't afford to irradiate all that oil, but there's also the fact that you'd wipe out vast numbers of non-combatants into the bargain, destroy some of the most holy sites of the world's largest religions and many of the oldest and most significant archaeological sites in the world.

The argment for nuclear disarmamant is simple and brutal. Using them is just not worth the consequences....so get rid of them, wholesale. We're not going to lose the knowledge, we're not going to lose jobs, we're not going to lose anything at all if we scrap nuclear weapons.

Sure they did, and your mountain of evidence really backs that up.

 Lots of information got leaked, including things that make the police look worse. Why would the police conspire to leak that information? The answer is they obviously wouldn't. There might have been a few officers who were giving information to he press, good and bad. Then again it might have been the family themselves who told the press. Either way, there was clearly no conspiracy to leak incriminating information, or else that would have been the ONLY information leaked.

In terms of leadership, no matter who is captain there will be leaders leading the team. Gerrard was captain of Liverpool, Carragher was a leader. Sometimes it works in tandem like those two, sometimes it turns into a power struggle. Henderson may turn out to be a fantastic captain, and I genuinely hope he does, but he isn't going to be a veteran, well rounded captain this season, it takes time. Gerrard was still learning things about captaincy last season, it's a constantly evolving art form. 

Performance wise, I kind of feel like we'll be better 80% of the time. With Gerrard, he could be having an average/poor game and still come up with a moment of brilliance to lift the whole team. I don't feel like our current midfield 3 (Lucas/Allen/Can and Hendo &amp; Milner) have that in their locked, but what they have over Stevie is the engine and legs to put in a shift every minute of every game, which Stevie couldn't do last season.

Legally I suspect you have an oral contract which by default would be considered an assured shorthold tenancy.

That's a negotiating position.  If you take that position then he has 2 (legal) options - walk away or sue you.  If he's rational he'll sue you if he thinks it's worthwhile (i.e. that he can win and that he'll be awarded enough money for it to be worth his time).  You need to persuade him that it's not worthwhile.  Refuting his claims is one part of that if you can make him doubt that he can win. Letting him know that you know that you can counter-sue for his failure to protect the deposit is another line of attack.  It lets him know that even if he wins his claim there's a good chance he'll end up out of pocket overall if you win yours.

There's also the point that if he's not protecting deposits and not using written agreements he may not be the most upstanding of citizens, at which point he may not want to attract too much attention to himself.

null,false,Anandya,null,null,null,"The problem is that we are ALREADY short on staff and the same idiot bitching about ""lazy doctors"" cut our jobs. In fact a year or so ago there were more Medical Graduates than there were Foundation Jobs so there were doctors on job seeker's allowance and the system didn't know how to deal with them since they were asking way more money for stuff that they need (You have to wear a suit for medical interviews, you have to travel far so you need to pay for a car. If you don't own a car it's a negative mark for many jobs). 

The problem is that weekends are unsocial. 

1. You don't want to work weekends. Saturday/Sunday off isn't the same as Monday, Tuesday off. Let's say you want to go grab a drink. Acceptable on Friday night, Sunday night that's just sad. Or your kids... You aren't there for them on the weekends. If you are lucky your partner will care for them. Single parent? You are SOL, few childminders work on the weekends and those that do charge such a premium that it may not be worth going to work. In general EVERY job pays more for unsocial hours. Except medicine and at some point you  have to draw the line and say ""Me and my family come before my patients"". I cannot treat patients if I am unhappy, unhealthy, unwell and those weekends are vital for that. 

2. We are short on staff. By a lot. Not just doctors, but nurses and allied staff. We are concentrating on demonising doctors but them and nurses are the ones around in critical/acute care on the weekends. The issue is pharmacologists, paramedics, cleaners, porters and hell? The shop. All those need to work too. 

3. If you work nights you are almost guaranteed to have more health issues than if you work days. Less vit D for starters, more unhealthy food. See, many places don't open late for doctors to eat (Yeah, you forget you have to run the canteen 24/7 and those guys charge overtime and unsocial hours unlike doctors). So doctors eventually grow out of a diet of fast food and takeaways to want a sane life. 

The problem is we need more staff, we can barely pay the staff we got right now and we keep talking about more cuts. It literally is ""We want this magic system that works with no staff, sees everyone immediately and has a 100% record and costs platitudes and pennies.""

You want to hear some good ideas? 

1. Subsidised child care. If a doctor has a child in school, offer a service where a child minder from the hospital goes and collects the child. 

2. On site family accomodation that's subsidised. Many an older doctor lived AT the hospital with their family and lived in simple small houses that gave them a leg up during their stay there. Why? You gave them free accomodation and you didn't have to pay them as much. Doctors liked it too since they didn't have to worry about cleaning and the like and simply saved money particularly since they didn't need to drive. 

3. Improve conditions for all staff. 

4. Rise of salaries along with inflation 

5. Improve staffiing levels. 

Do you know why we spend more money?  

Okay  watch this. 

Firstly? Staff budgets got cut. So hospitals couldn't pay regular staff. So they had big gaps which they filled with locums. Locums are pricier since they don't have job security. They are effectively a system to cover for leaves, illnesses and holidays and for short periods where staffing gaps exist. I don't know say you have 20 shifts set up in a 21 shift week so you hire a locum to do the spare shift. It's a sensible system that once saved money. However we are using locums to do everything because it comes from the emergency funds which are carte blanche. So the NHS costs way more money simply because we don't want to hire. The response is not ""cut more jobs"". 

Secondly? We made a huge drive to get patients out of the hospital and into the community without building the infrastructure needed for their care. This means more of them deteriorate and we need more ambulance call outs and more A&amp;E visits and those are expensive.

I understand the fear of UKIP taking our votes, but that's also because in my opinion, Labour weren't offering an alternative. Miliband might have been left-ish, but he was selling Tory ideals a lot of the time. 

If English Labour Party were to form, would you consider them to be primarily a centrist party, or would they swing left? If they become centrist, I'd argue we lose strength because we're back at simply aping Tory policy to a lesser degree and we'd never get back in again, if we push further left, then what's the point of splitting?

Why would it be? The argument for nukes is a deterrent for other nukes, not as an aggressive tool.

The current rules, as the Conservatives claim, certainly don't allow for past members of parliament or police officers to come forward with evidence and testimony and many claim they are still scared to do so over fears of prosecution and past cover-ups.

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/11745416/Labour-needs-saving-from-itself-and-Cameron-is-the-man-to-do-it.html

&gt;I know of one Tory donor who claims to have taken out five memberships of the Labour Party, under different names, so as to vote for Corbyn five times.

If Tory donors are doing this, the Trots on the left are exploiting the same loophole. There is nothing Lab can do if people lie - it doesn't have the power that govts have to investigate people's identities because of the Data Protection Act throwing up a screen. I suppose they could ask Experian to check - but that would cost an absolute fortune - I think each check is more than the cost of full membership.

&gt;Secondly, on the subject of this election, people voted for Labour to become a government on Miliband's manifesto, by your logic, it's fraud if we try to do anything different than what Miliband's Labour was proposing - right or left.

It's a fraud to move away from the essence they were electing. People know that the Conservatives are centre-right, Lab centre-left, Socialist Workers hard left and UKIP populist right. They can all change policies within those parameters.

But saying to the electorate, vote for a centre-left party and then get a Marxist party, ha, ha, tricked ya, is fraud. It's the same degree of movement that the LibDems underwent when they contested the 2010 election as centre-left and turned out centre-right. Are you saying their voters were *wrong* to be infuriated by this?

What else are you supposed to do? Fight tooth and nail for someone who doesn't even do research at your institution? 

If this was a research fellow and they fired him over this then I'd agree it was premature. But it wasn't. 

&gt;But why on earth did a university - an institution who's sole purpose is to extend the breadth and depth of human knowledge based on research and evidence 

The university's purpose is to educate students and carry out research. Almost everything they do is going to be in those two interests.

However, since it is specifically looking at the period 1997-2010, subsequent events don't diminish its findings, though they may throw new light on them.

The data shows clearly that an argument I have seen advanced by numerous people on this sub -- that the fact that 5,000,000 voters deserted the party between 1997 and 2010 means we should adopt more left-wing policies -- is wrong.

[This chart](http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/200_kellner_chart.jpg) lays out the issues quite clearly, showing that the 'deserters' -- people who left Labour between 1997 and 2010 -- are clearly to the right of Labour on many issues (EU, immigration, government assistance of the poor), and so are highly unlikely to be won over by pro-immigration, pro-welfare rhetoric. The article goes on to state that in terms of these views, the people who stopped voting Labour after 1997 are much closer to the general public than are those who stayed loyal to Labour. This suggests that there may be still more voters, other than these deserters, who could be won over if we were able to address these issues.

The same chart also shows that the deserters were not necessarily 'our traditional voters', in terms of unionisation, class, living in social housing, or even choice of newspaper. This means the simplistic argument that we 'lost our base' or 'betrayed our traditional voters' (or similar) is also wrong.

The data presented chimes perfectly with every post-election poll, which I suspect means it's accurate: We lost votes to the right and the centre, and we need to win them back to win again.

It is perfectly possible to argue that in order to win back these voters, we'd have to make too many compromises for it to be worth it, and that may be true. However, it is not possible to argue that 'being more left wing' would win back these voters. Nor is it possible to argue convincingly that we abandoned our traditional base (or vice-versa).

Anyone henceforth making the argument that we will win back 'Blair's lost voters' by moving left will be required to debunk this article, preferably by providing new data along the same lines.",null,0,null,1437651718,null,0,1437656102,0,ctd8mc6,null,t3_3eb80w,null,t1_ctd8mc6,null,t3_3eb80w,null,null,null,1438117904,null,8,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,8,null

Global peace. Different thing.

Not really, the moment the legitimate Ukrainian government was overthrown it was clear that it's supporters (in the East and Crimea) were never going to accept being disenfranchised in that way.

 But, if you actually look at the studies they use as proof, there's next to nothing there that actually proves anything. The experiments are either done in non-humans, not in living bodies at all and just cells, in doses so concentrated that you'd have to smoke a truck load of the stuff in order to get it, or completely isolated compounds that are derived from chemicals in cannabis. It's like they just copy pasted the list from a weed advocate's website instead of actually reading the studies they're pasting and doing some research themselves beyond googling ""Weed cures X"".

If people want to push for legalization because of the supposed health benefits, then surely they'd have no problem at all with finding the active ingredient that's beneficial, upping the dose and selling it as medicine while throwing out everything else.

What else are you supposed to do? Fight tooth and nail for someone who doesn't even do research at your institution?

The nature of his job isn't strictly relevant, but only because of the PR aspect (contradicting myself slightly).  It was his standing that gave the weight his PR work, they were aiming for a halo effect and people thinking that he did do research there.

Generating ""good PR"" and ""bad PR"" is a bit circular too.  By getting rid of Hunt so quickly, they cemented events as being ""bad""; and left negative connotations on not only his name, but also the university (because of that halo effect, it would have left people believing that gender-segregated labs were a thing at UCL).  The essentially locked-in maximum damage, as well as damaging themselves by being seen to side with the mob vs science.

It would have been different if this were the tip-of-the-iceberg and there was more to come out, damage limitation is a good strategy then.  But it turns out they acted at the worst possible time.  If they had left it until these other versions of events came out the damage would have been diluted and everyone would have forgotten about it six months later.

The trouble is, none of these Twitter spats are ever really based on evidence, and they hardly ever matter at all on the grand-scheme of things.  Some do, but that's a ""a broken clock is correct twice a day"" thing; the rightness of a cause is completely independent of the number of people banging-on-about-it on Twitter, sometimes they're right, usually they're wrong.

&gt; The university's purpose is to educate students and carry out research. Almost everything they do is going to be in those two interests. To do both of those things, they need strong students and capable graduates to come there, and they also need funding. If they think Tim Hunt being embroiled in this story was keeping away more people than Tim Hunt being at UCL bringing in, then they get rid of him, because his sole purpose is to bring people and resources to the university.

Pragmatically that is correct, but universities especially ought to aim higher than that.  They don't have monthly sales targets, they can play the long game.

The Twitter-mob trend is going to continue for the foreseeable future.  All organisations are going to have to learn to deal with it.  They can't just do what the mob says, for many reasons:

   * the mob often isn't a domain expert on the issue

   * the mob (as in this case) is working off incorrect (and/or heavily framed) information

   * the mob often wants contradictory things

They're going to have to learn the lessons of party politics.  Many front-bench politicians have said things much worse than Tim Hunt did (but they actually meant it literally), for example, yet they still get elected and maintain positions of power and influence.  Why?  Because they know the volume of noise against them (and there is a lot, there were daily hate campaigns against Cameron in the months before the election) is mostly irrelevant, they have reached peace with the fact that a not insignificant percentage of humanity completely hates them, they don't try and win them over, they drown them out.

Not to mention that once the trend of mob-demands and public firings becomes entrenched, then it becomes an offensive weapon.  And, again, universities ought to know better than allowing (or even being seen to be allowing) non-academic influences control what is or isn't allowed to be taught or how it should or shouldn't be taught.

TL;DR: they asked him to leave because they wished it hadn't kicked off, not because asking him to leave was the correct way of handling events once it had kicked off.  And by reacting that way, they will be more vulnerable to Twitter campaigns in future.",null,0,null,1437653128,null,0,1437653463,0,ctd931h,null,t3_3e8f6p,null,t1_ctd931h,null,t1_ctd8gh3,null,null,null,1438118260,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

Clyne - in for Johnson. Would have been insane not to buy a RB.

Ings/Origi - strikers for when Benteke/Sturridge are injured or for cup/Europa games. Having all 4 strikers fit would be a miracle, more likely 2 will be out at any given time. 

Gomez - simple depth at LB, potentially filling in at CB if there are calamitous injuries.

Milner - in for Gerrard. Unavoidable.

Do you buy really small quantities of everything?

I buy in bulk when I can. A 10kg sack of rice is a hell of a lot cheaper than buying ten 1kg bags, for example. Learn to love dried beans and the like - and especially lentils and barley. They all help bulk stuff out while being dirt cheap and bloody tasty.

Buy cheap, less fashionable cuts of meat. You might need to cook them longer, but they're often tastier if cooked right. Buy big lumps of meat instead of pre-cut - cut it yourself when you get home and put it in freezer bags.

Buy cheap, less fashionable fish. Instead of cod, buy coley.

Consider the less fashionable vegetables, such as swedes, parsnips and beetroot.

Do you ever throw food away?

I rarely throw food away. If, for example, I've got some veggies that are beginning to look at bit sad, then I chuck them in the freezer. Same with offcuts of meat. When there's enough there, it makes a good soup or stew. I even freeze bones with bits of meat left on them and boil them to make stock. It's cheaper than buying stock cubes, and tastier too.

1. will you be paying your dad rent? if not, how will he make money on his investment? is he going to ask you to buy him out in 5 years?

2. will your dad be contributing to the mortgage payments? he doesn't have to, but if he doesn't then you will struggle to get a mortgage as much as you are now (his share won't decrease the mortgage LTV, it will effectively reduce the value of the house the bank uses in the LTV calc)

3. what happens in the worst case scenario? is your dad going to take you to court if you can't pay him back?

one thing for you to consider: instead of equity, your dad could give you the money as a second charge loan.  this means that the bank mortgage has the first charge over the property (ie: if they repossess, then they get first rights to the house value) - they will be happy because your dad's loan would not affect them.  your dad will also receive interest from you at whatever rate you agree (so it is an investment). this would still need to be documented properly  by a solicitor, and it won't be super-simple, but it will be simpler than an equity share i reckon.",null,0,null,1437653707,null,0,false,0,ctd9adq,null,t3_3e75j0,null,t1_ctd9adq,null,t3_3e75j0,null,null,null,1438118395,null,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1,null

From the article:

&gt;The real differences between defectors and loyalists start to emerge when we compare the papers they read and where they place themselves on the left-right scale. Loyalists divide fairly evenly between right-wing and left-of-centre papers. Readers of the Mirror or the Guardian account for 31 per cent of loyalists, while 29 per cent read the Mail, Sun, Star, Express or Telegraph. The reading habits of the three million defectors that Labour would like to win back are very different. For every Guardian or Mirror reader there are four who read a right-wing paper.

&gt;As for ideology, 60 per cent of loyalists describe themselves as left-of-centre and only 23 per cent as centre or right-of-centre. Among defectors, on the other hand, 36 per cent describe themselves as left and 48 per cent as centre or right. If we convert each person’s answer into an index number, from minus 100 for very left-wing, via 0 for centre, to plus 100 for very right-wing, then the average location of the loyalists is minus 35, while that of defectors is minus six.",null,0,null,1437653788,null,0,false,0,ctd9bek,null,t3_3eb80w,null,t1_ctd9bek,null,t3_3eb80w,null,null,null,1438118419,null,5,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,5,null

&gt; Even if Russia did attack the UK, it wouldn't be via nukes. Their military forces would just steam roll over ours anyway, they would have no need to use nukes. Since their military is so much larger than ours.

The problem with that is their conventional forces need to *get to the UK*, which involves coming through Europe or sailing around and coming down from the Arctic.

What that means is that this question:

&gt; So what exactly is the size of the UK military forces compared to Russia. Size of our military budget to theirs?

becomes *irrelevant*. Yes, Russia has 700,000 military personnel compared to the UK's 140,000. But it doesn't have enough ships or aircraft to get them all here, and if they're going via Europe then you need to add the military strength of the intermediate countries to the UK's military. Russia has huge numbers of tanks and towed artillery - none of which is any use until they get within 20 miles of the UK.

Their aircraft have to negotiate not only our air force but also our air defences including Rapier installations and Type 45 Destroyers.

On paper they have a lot of transport aircraft, but how many of those are actually serviceable? Same with their submarine fleet and their transport fleet. The UK and Russia have the same number of trainer aircraft, which tells you something about the number of pilots we each have available.

Incidentally, the UK's defence budget is about $61Bn/yr to Russia's $70Bn. $9Bn is a lot, but it's not a show stopping amount.

**TL;DR**
**Fundamentally, Russia's overwhelming strength in personnel and land warfare is of no relevance until they physically land on British soil, and it's not at all clear that the Russian Air Force could gain and maintain the air superiority necessary to facilitate those landings.**",null,0,null,1437653870,null,0,false,0,ctd9cg5,null,t3_3ea8go,null,t1_ctd9cg5,null,t1_ctd6wvz,null,null,null,1438118438,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

I can see where you are coming from but it's certainly nicer than some of the surrounding buildings. They've recently done the same thing aesthetically to the tower blocks by the canal basin- and they still look like dreary monoliths.

The trouble with the new study inn places is that they charge a very high price, so much so that they are willing to have empty rooms, unlike the dirt cheap but poorly maintained terrace housing that try's to be occupied.

I don't think you're following your own points, here. In the event of a nuclear war, should one occur, you're suggesting that we'd be spared for a while because we have nukes. I say that, in the event of a nuclear war, I don't want to survive, as the horrors of surviving a nuclear war far outweigh the microsecond of agony and swift death of being in the strike radius of a nuclear missile. I think that's quite a clear argument, personally.

&gt; What negates nukes as a deterrent? 

Terrorist action. 

Nobody pointed a nuke at Dublin and told the IRA to stop. Nobody pointed a nuke at wherever they thought Bin Laden was hiding and told him to stop. Nobody's pointing nukes at whatever city ISIS is using as its' base today and telling them to stop.

Said above I wouldn't make any more replies, but honestly, really? 

If one politician says that your belief in another politician is misplaced then it's engaging in unacceptable abuse?  I find that *insane*.  Again - the only reason people here see it as abuse is because they either hate Blair and/or like Corbyn.  Nobody would give a damn if Corbyn said this about Kendall.  In fact people here would be cheering him on.

Good god, half the comments I've seen directed at Kendall on this subreddit are orders of magnitude worse than anything Blair's said.  Didn't seem to upset anyone you lot then.  

Well, at least Corbyn's not going to win, so this will all blow over in a few weeks.  But still, it does seem nuts to me.  Reminds me of the Ron Paul supporters a few years back who also couldn't take *any* criticism of their hero.

The players who are definitely starters are Hendo, Milner, Benteke, Coutinho, and a back 4. You're right we're gonna have kamikaze right and left back to get us more width. The best formation that brings the best out of everyone is having milner and hendo play behind Coutinho and those three behind another three(Benteke, Lallana, someone else). Coutinho is our best player and he plays best behind a front three. What will then happen is Hendo and Milner take turns pushing while the other stays back. The only thing Lucas brings is that he would always stay back while the other (Hendo) pushes. Now lets say you think Coutinho should be in the front three, That means you have lucas behind Milner and Hendo, and Coutinho up top with Benteke and Lallana/Firmino/other forwards. The problem with this is you're dropping lallana/Firmino for the added benefit of allowing Hendo and Milner to push all the time. Please realize, in you're example, of a counter attack, you're assuming a defense of Hendo and milner will push all the time, but in actuality they will take turns. While not in the counter attack we'll have people who are not as good as Lucas, but to be honest we don't need them too because the team would be better.

Firstly, rightly or wrongly the majority of people in the UK do not appear to want a true left-wing government. And by true left wing I mean someone who will nationalise the rail, increase taxation etc. 

This may be partly because of some of the hangover from the 70s (older voters), it may be because many of the lefts ideals (welfare state, national health etc) have been so much of a success that genuinely trying to get rid of them is unlikely to happen any time soon and therein lies in the problem. 

Kinnock (yeah ok long time ago I know) offered old school socialism. No-one wanted it, even after Major! Blair came along with his ""3rd way"" which was basically Tory-lite with increased social spending, and boy did they spend! A lot of it was needed and much was positive but things like tax credits were a bit of a crap way of redistributing wealth since it effectively taxed the lower middle and middle classes and then paid them back. 

The crisis of 2008 kind of killed Labour's economic credibility and Brown was never that popular. Milibands entrance took the party a bit more to the left but the main problem was the lack of a true social vision. Not that the tories have one as such but their thing is the economy and balancing the books.

The left of labour either need to form a separate party which will be forever a minority party with the rest of labour either joining the libdems or vanishing away in to the Tory fold.

You cannot expect a player, unless the player is truly exceptional, to just walk into one of the best teams in the world at 19/20/21 years of age. 

Thankfully, some of our best prospects, including, Bamford, Christensen and Kalas are understanding this and have signed new deals. 

When they are good enough, Mourinho will give them an opportunity. Just look at Courtois. He was patient, went on loan and came back as our number 1. 

I think we are better off letting players go who don't posses this patience, the prime example is Lukaku.

That doesn't mean it's ok for people in positions of authority to make shitty disparaging remarks about women (or any other group), nor does it make it ok for people to support him with the pretence ""oh, but he was only joking"".

I just don't really consider ""silly old man gets sacked for saying stupid thing"" to be a news story, especially when the bloke is a millionaire with plenty of opportunities.

He should win his industrial tribunal for being sacked without proper recourse, but he should never again have a position of power over those he thinks ""too emotional"" for the job.

There is no ""context"" to this - he said afterwards and in all seriousness that he thinks women too emotional, and that's what's not ok.

You only think there's something alarming about the Hunt story if you haven't been paying attention, or if you think that people like him are more important than everyone else.

Tim Hunt's story is one where a university mishandled a disciplinary procedure in the face of very mild social media frenzy - there is nothing systemic about it. Hunt is able to find another job of the kind which he finds rewarding or satisfying or, if he's got any sense, he's got the resources to enjoy a proper retirement.

I'm going to use your comment as a launchpad for a discussion, so bear with me.

Many of you will be seeing the above comment as evidence that Corbyn can indeed win back left-wing voters and thereby propel us into government. There are [lots](http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/features/labour-voters-election-europe-immigration) of [reasons](http://touchstoneblog.org.uk/2015/05/the-tucs-election-post-mortem-poll/) to [believe](http://www.scribd.com/doc/271940748/Listening-to-Labour-s-Lost-Labour-Voters-bbm-Research-July-2015) that's [untrue](http://www.fabians.org.uk/the-mountain-to-climb/) (certainly the second half of the statement), but let's roll with it for a moment.

Let's imagine that a Conservative voter came onto this sub and said:

&gt;As a Conservative Party voter, if Kendall becomes the leader of the Labour Party I will join and back her. Labour should not be afraid of going right, they need to draw the disillusioned voters in and stand for something the public can get behind, rather than being a lefty pressure group. It is an exciting time and I hope Labour can move forward with Kendall at the helm.

I've been having a quick look around online for kits and all seem to start around £180, i'm clearly looking at the wrong thing. I know the Sena's have a great rep but adding it to the costs of a week long tour would not be ideal. I'll see if I can find the BT kits you mentioned.

I reckon the main difference in comfort from the CBR to GS will be for her posture, she'll be way more upright on the GS with the benefit of being able to lean back against the top box. I'll see how this saturday's ride goes and will have to call it based on that. 

I just reckon the trip will feel like more of an adventure if we set off from our house rather than start with a 5 hour train ride to Edinburgh, so here's hoping the CBR is comfortable enough for her.

Definitely agree that chatting will be an added benefit so will be making a plan about the comms.

Yes.

In the article I linked to you Mearsheimer destroys the gross factual inaccuracies you've been peddling. 

&gt; None of this changes the fact that Russia had and has no reason to be interfering in Ukrainian politics or annexing Ukrainian territory.

They have every reason - it's their national security. Having a pro-NATO state on their doorstep would be a threat to their territorial integrity, just as the USA thought having Cuba in the Soviet fold was a threat to their national security. 

No other Russian leader would've behaved any different. Furthermore, considering the violent pogroms being launched by the Kiev regime against Russian speaking civilians in Eastern Ukraine (well documented by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International) I think Russia's decision to annex Crimea was the right one. Not only does it reflect the overwhelming wishes of the Russian people who live there, but it prevented Crimea from being victim to the sort of ethnic cleansing and violence that Donbass and other areas were subject to.

Based on what? Just because 25% of people voted Tory in the last election that doesn't mean there isn't a majority in favour of a truly left-wing government. The main problem is that if the did-not-votes actually voted, no-one is really sure which way they'd swing, but a substantial number of them are former labour voters that jumped ship in dismay while Blair was in office.

Its interesting that Milliband actually managed to get some of those voters back and increase Labour's support in the last election - its the huge swing from the Lib Dems to Tory that truly gave Cameron a majority.

What this country needs, more than anything, is electoral reform, and its the one thing its guaranteed not to get because the party in power benefits most from the current system. Labour's big short-sighted failure was not enacting reform while in office, because they have previously benefited from FPTP.

I've no idea what this even means.

&gt; the fact that european countries are not in the world colonising business since 1945 might had big part to do with that.

Ukraine (who gave up all their nukes) would like a word.

&gt;Lets just ignore the Global politics are vastly different post 1945 compared to lead up to wwi and wwii.

It's almost as if a new factor was introduced at that point that made carrying on in the same manner impossible.

&gt;Interesting and can you link this general consensus?

Google is your friend. This isn't news or a never-discussed subject.

&gt;Also how come Russia and China are talking about inevitable China- US conflict. 

Talking.

&gt; Seems like Nuclear Deterrent isn't doing much good there to deter the tensions between two nuclear armed nations.

Even though it hasn't happened? Now you're dictating the future on top of ignoring the past.

You may as well add 'yes, but my agenda demands...' as a preface to each statement.

That poll is showing:

* More people said Labour should be more right-wing than left-wing, but both scores and the difference between them are incredibly low, and the analysis claims this could either mean they're ok with the current position or didn't care.  Not a flying start for Corbyn, but hardly damning evidence against.
* People thought Labour was too soft on big business and the banks, and should be harder on the rich.  Not exactly out of line with what Corbyn is suggesting...
* People are worried about the big three: economic credibility, immigration, and benefit fraud.  Honestly, the economic credibility section is _not_ a great big barrier to left-wing politics, and even the TUC poll shows that because _both_ of the anti-austerity options at least competed well with the austerity option, maintaining very small and probably insignificant leads but leads nonetheless.

In fact, the _analysis_ on that poll says (emphasis mine):

&gt; Labour’s fundamental problem appears to be a failure to present itself as competent to run the economy. **The poll does not tell us how that might be done**. In practice it will be a complex combination of policy, character and above all a clear sense of what Labour thinks is wrong with the economy and what needs to be done to improve it.

Obviously I'd have to plow through all the other articles, but I honestly don't see how the electorate can be constantly washed as insufficiently left to give Corbyn a chance of winning (and let's be fair, it's always a _chance_, nobody here is arguing any candidate is a shoe-in).  Yes, he has his work cut out for him on immigration and welfare, and convincing people he's economically credible.  But anti-austerity is clearly not off the cards, there is a growing amount of evidence (here and elsewhere) that there are little bits of policy here and there on which he can build a campaign, and the question is really whether he can convince people that he has the answers to their _perceptions_ based on _legitimate failures_ of systems (immigration and welfare).",null,0,null,1437658644,null,0,false,0,ctdbhkb,null,t3_3ebd73,null,t1_ctdbhkb,null,t1_ctdaqpk,null,null,null,1438119949,null,2,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,2,null

The last 30 years. Seriously, do you have any evidence that the UK as a whole is interested in nationalisation of things? I appreciate the reddit echo chamber finds a lot of similar souls but the real world is quite different.

&gt; The main problem is that if the did-not-votes actually voted, no-one is really sure which way they'd swing, but a substantial number of them are former labour voters that jumped ship in dismay while Blair was in office.

If they don't vote then surely that is their problem? There *are* left wing parties out there why dont they vote for them? It's not Labour or nothing.

&gt; What this country needs, more than anything

Yes and no, I see a lot of value in it but it is not without significant downside. That said, how would you feel about a Tory/UKIP government? That is a very likely outcome with PR-based systems.

&gt; Oh they have social vision alright, its just that it is based on eliminating the welfare state, and privatising schools and the NHS, believing that markets will fix everything.

In principle why can't hospitals be privatised? There are many models in more ""socialist"" countries which have public funding for private models. The state should be a regulator and where appropriate provide funds to allow services to be provided. There's no reason and little to suggest that the State is somehow more wonderful at provision of service than the private sector.

That's not to say the private sector doesnt royally fuck things up from time to time but then public sector is a long from perfect also (see pretty much any IT project).

If a person lacks the intelligence or knowledge to hold moral principles beyond basic punishment/reward, or ""laws = good"" then justifications based on developed moral principles are going to be no more understood than by a cat.

&gt;But perhaps most damaging is what the events of this week have revealed about those supposed Labour modernisers. If Tony Blair’s speech is anything to go by, then they’ve now lost the plot as badly as the Corbynites. The fact Blair was even giving a speech at this time shows an utterly staggering lack of self-awareness. Staggering, that is, if his objective was to actually assist the moderate elements within his old party.

&gt;Though the timing was nowhere near as staggering as what he actually said. “Let me make my position clear”, he told his audience. “I wouldn’t want to win on an old-fashioned leftist platform. Even if I thought it was the route to victory. I wouldn’t take it.”

&gt;Yep, that’s perfectly clear. Tony Blair would rather lose an election than win it the wrong way. In other words, the same ideological, dogmatic, no-compromise-with-the-electorate lunacy that consigned Labour to the wilderness for the best part of two decades and threatens to consign it to the wilderness for the best part of the next two decades.

&gt;The idea that winning elections is some form of political bonus prize is precisely why Labour is in its present mess. And if even Tony Blair is now peddling this rubbish then Labour’s in an even worse state than many of us suspected. It’s also why Liz Kendall is about to be reduced to the status of humiliating also-ran.

&gt;But then the Gods have already cursed Tony Blair.

Couple of things to note

1. Rossiter was immense throughout and was bossing the midfield. Tidy with the ball, good anticipation, awareness and didnt put a foot wrong all game long. Played closer to the centre backs akin Gerrard in the past few seasons.

2. Pedro did alright, got a decent goal and linked up well with Teixeira and Ings. That said, he looked rather ordinary perhaps due to being played further up the pitch.

3. Was excited when I realised Ojo was starting but it soon turned to disappointment. He did alright but against a fairly terrible Malaysian team he should've done a lot more with the ball. He often looked heavy when running and did very little when he had the ball.

4. Standout performers were Ings and Markovic. The two started linking up a little bit more towards the end of the game and a front 3 of markovic, Ings and Wilson looked infinitely better than Texeira, Ings and Ojo

5. Nice cameo from Wilson towards the end of the match. He did more in 15 mins than what Ojo did in 45 mins. Had a couple of chances and was involed in a goal.

6. Cleary came on at the same time as Wilson but did very little. Maguire on the other hand was very impressive, similar to a Jon Flanagan type of player. Has a good cross on him too

7. Texeira's goal was class. Knew the keeper was out of his line and chipped the ball right over. That said, he was rather ordinary as well.

In the video Carswell advocates tax cuts because (c 8:50 in the video) ""the reason the world has got so much better is more and more things we can run for ourselves"".

That's great for people like him, who have the resources to get things done for themselves - on a large salary a tax cut may allow him to buy BUPA health insurance or invest money for the future.

For those at the bottom, however, a tax cut has less beneficial effect - they rely on essential services like the NHS or (should they lose their jobs) unemployment benefits which are funded by taxation.

Carswell's implied ""any tax cut is a good tax cut"" doesn't account for the fact that wealth tends to accumulate, and the wealthy then tend to end up as [rentiers](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rentier#English) whose income is derived from other peoples' work.

""If you're wealthy, they should pay shit loads"" sounds a bit spiteful, and I don't think it *is* ""super super simple"" for a bunch of reasons.

But I do believe that governments were created to solve the problems like ~~the aristocrat-peasant divide~~ wealth inequality, and progressive taxation is a necessary cure.

""Tax is immoral because it's the state taking away something you've earned"" is the kind of claim we see regularly on this subreddit from at least one teenager, but it's a rejection of economic reality.

That was agreed because it was a *real* emergency. Will they agree to renationalise electricity, railways etc? Nope, not least because French and German companies are running those utilities.  In order for Corbyn's policy to work *we have to leave the EU*. Yet his supporters (especially the Greens) are ardent fans of the EU.

2. Giving up our nuclear deterrent - apart from the fact that we're in an uncertain world, decommissioning is more expensive than renewing Trident. When Ukraine decommissioned, the USA paid the costs - and then they got invaded by Russia.

Fuck knows. 

&gt; We're both for legalisation and I'm telling you that the US has better herbs because of it.

I agree with that, but you are making mad claims about weed being weaker in the US. Perhaps you smoked some really weak stuff there, and some really strong stuff here, but that does not mean weed is generally weaker there. 

&gt; I know for a fact that outdoor grows on rich west-coast soil are fundamentally weaker

That is absolutely not true. 

&gt; indoor fluorescent strip lights 

No-one uses fluorescent lights to grow dope. Another thing where you're half informed. 

I'm sorry man, we do agree on legalisation but outwith that you have said so many things that are obviously not correct. Your heart appears to be in the right place, and I do think you believe what you are saying, but you are incorrect about a number of things.

I mean you state that weed in Washington is ""much weaker"". I show you a link that shows otherwise and you then claim that the strong stuff *is* in fact available for ""heavy users"" (which is nonsense. It's all available at the same dispensaries and a lot of people are going to do what they do in Amsterdam coffee shops ""Give me the strongest you've got"")

I'm not sure what you're trying to prove, if anything. You might just be a fair bit less informed than you think you are. Which is ok. Just stop trying to claim things as facts when they are not. 


I'm trying to get my head round this. I think your argument is ""We should legalise weed because then we'd have the weak stuff that Washington has and people would be better off"" whereas mine is ""We should legalise weed so people can better choose how strong they want their weed and the media hype of KILLER SUPER SKUNK is a load of nonsense anyway""

I think we agree on everything other than you buying in to the killer skunk thing and imagining this weak weed in Washington thing (not that weak weed is available, but that it is the norm).

No party has ever had as many members before or since. And like all mass movements they were successful. The Conservatives were in power for most of the second half of the 20th century.

They are still a force - the reason we have a Conservative govt now is because their voters were *determined* to keep the SNP out of govt and hauled themselves to the polls to vote and stop them.

José is going to be our rock in the back (possibly his last year of doing so) and have a massive impact on the younger defenders trying to break the first team. 

Lordy, yes that's what I wanna call him, will fill the boots Morgan left so I'm not really worried there but I think this year we might see less and less of one S. Davis as the year progresses. Prowsey and Harry are established members of the first team and I think this year will see them both feature regularly together (where Prowsey was the more regular face in the previous year) and Big Vic will anchor the midfield.

I've pointed to a fairly excellent array of sources that prove my point, and made numerous quite lengthy posts explaining all of them. You have yet to show me how a set of left-wing policies can be used to persuade a group of voters, most of whom voted for right wing parties at the last election, to vote Labour. That's all you have to do.

If you could show me that people who abandoned us from 1997-2010 were left-wing, you might have a point. But you can't, because they weren't.

If you could show me how winning more left-wing votes, including from non-voters, would help us win seats from the Tories, you would have a point. But you can't, because they wouldn't.

If I'm wrong, find me the sources. Don't just make assertions: Find me the studies that show how Jeremy Corbyn assembles a majority. I keep showing everyone sources that show that, short of a collective damascene conversion, the British people will not elect a party of the kind he wants to lead. In response, Corbyn's supporters keep showing me nothing, then turning up the next day making the exact same arguments. It's getting a little frustrating.

As for the Falklands: Both Labour and the Conservatives supported the war -- in fact, we helped push them into it. Yet only they benefited electorally. Do you think you might be missing something, here? Did the Falklands also help Thatcher win a second landslide in 1987 and help her successor, who was not even part of the Cabinet during the Falklands conflict, win in 1992? How far does the magic Falklands effect go? Is it also why we spent 1997-2010 losing voters to our right?

I'll leave you with something that was said about that article a few days ago:

&gt; We need to slow down a bit here. That Sky article is very misleading.

&gt; First, it is entirely based on ""reports in Spain."" As far as I've seen, SPORT is the only one reporting, and they're apparently not the most trustworthy. Their first story claimed Chelsea are interested, and we had both Mourinho and Fabregas call him in an attempt to lure him to London. The second story was quotes from Pedro refuting the first story, saying he hasn't been in touch with Mourinho. He does confirm that his buyout was lowered and there have been offers, but nowhere does he mention Chelsea is one of them.

&gt; The Sky article seems to be combining those two SPORT reports. The title itself is misleading, as the ""Pedro says Barcelona have offers for him"" should be separate from the ""amid Chelsea interest,"" as they come from separate reports. The fact that Pedro refuted the first SPORT article, the only one saying we're interested, makes me question whether we are actually trying to sign him at all.

In terms of quality journalism and analysis the [New Left Review](http://newleftreview.org/) is good as is the [London Review of Books](http://www.lrb.co.uk/).

If you have any interest in Podcasts then I also recommend Richard Wolff's [Economic Update](http://www.democracyatwork.info/radio/) and Doug Henwood's [Behind the News](http://www.leftbusinessobserver.com/Radio.html). [Against the Grain](http://www.againstthegrain.org/) is quite similar to Doug Henwood's podcast but it is more eclectic and less focused on economics.

There are some great blogs out there too. Michael Roberts is a Marxist economist who is [worth reading](https://thenextrecession.wordpress.com/), his analysis on Greece has been really insightful. [Johnnyvoid](https://johnnyvoid.wordpress.com/) is a decent libertarian socialist blogger who focuses mostly welfare issues.

It's hardly a shining example of the benefits, but [the Italian train operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrovie_dello_Stato_Italiane#1986.E2.80.93Present) tackles this by being a 100% state-owned, if formally separate, company.  I think even just having a state-owned company bidding for franchises would be an excellent step away from the screwy mess Britain's railways are in now.  Besides, especially in the wake of Greece, I think the left needs to re-think the EU, and certainly Jeremy seems to be on the verge of this.
2. Hmm, I'd have to see independent evidence on this, because it's something that never comes up on one side of the argument and another side of the argument.  I honestly think that the threat of being invaded is overblown, and that our real threat (short-term at least) is from things like ISIS that are so widespread, information-based, and decentralised that nuclear weapons are laughably useless against them.
3. Homeopathy _is_ a scam, but it's one that has a lot of anecdotal evidence, primarily due to the placebo effect.  As such, it's taken in a lot of people, including Jeremy--_[Hunt](http://www.lbc.co.uk/watch-jeremy-hunt-live-on-lbc-from-7pm-96835)_, that is, not just Corbyn.  The NHS already spends a lot of money on it, so one could argue that a Labour government that supports it, while pissing money down the drain, is no worse than the alternative.

But anyway, I'd argue that the last two points have precious little to do with the planned economy anyway, even if they're Jeremy Corbyn's pet interests.

Classic chicken and egg problem, no reason to put on more trains because nobody uses it anyway. Nobody uses it because the trains aren't frequent enough.

It's kind of amazing that the station is still open. The next village over, Carlton,  had a railway station in the early 1900's.

&gt;Labour failed to admit its mistakes in the run up to the banking crisis.

My personal opinion on this is that Labour's mistakes were Conservative's mistakes. I don't think they would have done much differently. They capitalised well on a narrative they wrote there. That somehow a global economic problem was down to the choices Labour made, when in reality in opposition they weren't really offering an alternative.

&gt;Labour did not have a plausible strategy for reducing the deficit.

Didn't Labour plan to reduce the deficit in much the same way the Conservatives are, only less severely? Didn't the Conservatives ease up on austerity after their plan didn't go how they wanted? 

I mean look at the party pledges;

&gt;Eliminate the deficit and run an overall surplus by the end of the parliament

There's one party's policy.

&gt;Balance the books by cutting the deficit every year, with a surplus on the current budget and national debt falling in the next Parliament

And another's. They just differ in time-scale. Something that economists have criticised the Conservatives for - being too austeric.

Well say anything you want about Corbyn but he definitely is not Ed Milliband.

Right from the word go until today this has been the pattern evidenced from history - even after the devastation of WWI, the capitalist governments - including US/UK - and their allies managed to put together an invasion force to rush in and attack the newly emerged revolutionary government of Russia, and it's happened in pretty much every other case since.  

Indochina was bombed almost back into the stone age, with more munitions and firepower than were deployed in the whole of WWII, and to the victors went none of the spoils because the US made sure of that - failing to pay agreed upon war reparations and cutting Vietnam off from almost all possibility of global trade.  Kind of hard to be a successful socialist government under those circumstances (setting aside whether a Stalinist model was going to get much traction anyway!)

Secondly, I'm sure they'll have absolutely no problem attracting someone to work on this. And as someone else has pointed out already in this thread, there is no shortage of economists who agree with Sinn Fein. Just like EVERY other profession in the world, people, no matter how qualified, will have their own take on a situation and what is best for it. 

And even if they don't find someone who agrees with them, they wouldn't be the first political party in the world to charge blindly ahead with and idea they have regardless of the facts or the advice of experts.

null,false,CastrosExplodinCigar,,Randalstown,null,"This is a minor story but a story none the less. Most political parties recruit from within, often to their detriment. Kudos to Sinn Fein for fishing from another pond.

However, since Sinn Fein pay a ""Living wage"" to all employees, what highly qualified economic guru is going to accept a living wage when they could be earning 4 times that at PWC and will the party allow the man doing the sums to be paid more than the guys and ex comrades on the front line or those who did 16 years for the cause. Who will Gerry and Martin listen to when formulating an economic policy, former hunger striker who nearly died for a socialist republic or an Oxford economics graduate who tells them what the reality of the situation is.

Sinn Fein are one of the closest and tightly knit political parties in Europe. There's very little dissent and no criticism of the leadership. For them to go outside and seek help shows a considerable shift in thinking. 

For example, within the past year Sinn Fein have lost two senior advisors. Two lifelong members, one of whom did considerable time for bomb offenses. He didn't go running to the press, I only found out about it when I was talking to a colleague and they asked if I knew anything about it. This guy didn't have a qualification to his name but the Sinn Fein tradition or rewarding people with advisor/senior posts for time well spent inside, looks like it is coming to an end.

It's also a story from this aspect too, when I was at uni many years ago, Sinn Fein were actually paying the tuition of 2 people that I knew. One went onto become a senior advisor and another I think faded into obscurity. They were both Sinn Fein youth members and party invested in their education.

According to my GF, it's not the posture but the seat width and how soft &amp; comfortable it is and where the handles are. On the Bandit we had a Givi box with a backrest (which in theory should have been very comfy), on the Brick we had the LT's built-in box w/o the backrest, she sometimes complained that she wanted to put her back to something but she was OK in the end. The Bandit's seat simply hurt her bottom after a while... 

We started near London, went to Wales, then travelled slowly up to the Scottish Border and came down on the east side of England via York. The trip up was perfectly fine, on the return leg we came did a couple of long legs and she complained about those.

I'd advise you to break the Scotland trip into two days and you should be fine I guess, same with the return trip. On your test ride do a long stint, say, go to the Lake District. That's almost there. When I'm going to Scotland or whereabouts, I usually book a room at or near one of the lakes, start early in the morning, then I'm there around lunchtime, enjoy the lakes &amp; the scenery, do a couple of the passes, have a couple of pints at the hotel or a nearby pub, then have a good night's sleep then hit the road again for Scotland.

I think it's more to do with the idea of nation building than a border poll. 

Sure, lets say it's 2040 and a border poll will likely [or ultimately] favours a UI. 

NI isn't just being subsumed into the RoI. This isn't just Scottish independence. It's the creation of an entirely new state from one state and another quasi-state.

It's going take decades to decide what goes where, and who does what, and where this UI will stand in the world. 

Then you've got whatever timeframe the UN, Europe, whoever, decide to give the UK and RoI governments for handover to this new state that I've heard fuck all detail about and it's already 2015. 

I'm not sniping at you - just I'd expect people who want this to be talking about what it will bring and what it is practically, already - maybe they do talk, but I don't hear it [that could just be my ignorance]. Yet these very same people couldn't fuck NI's education system up more if they tried and can't build a stadium without fucking that up either. I just don't quite trust them with the idea of a nation. And honestly hope SF dies with the creation of this UI. 

I just think it's got more to do with governments than people - and governments take their time. And so they should - when the world will be watching and so much money and effort will be poured in to something that absolutely cannot be allowed to fail or be seen to fail.

That's why I'm estimating about 2080 at the least. This generation of politicians and ex-combatants will be dead. Only people who were children during the troubles are still live and they're auld as fuck. No one remembers except in video and books, it's all myth and legend, the idea of UI can be marketed very differently to a different generation of young secular, intelligent, up and coming humans to do what they wish with. Loyalists rising up won't be a problem. I can actually see them being allowed to travel to Britain to set up shop if they wish or stay and be British in Ireland. Any who do rise up will be fucking destroyed by police who have ben monitoring them since the PSNI was set up.

This is why I have not gone looking for anything, my suspicions are based off a smell (when all I have to go off is what the internet says cannabis smells like), a previous history, and a possible sighting of a bong (I didn't want to look closely).

If I were to go into the room they are staying in, find cannabis, and then immediately call the police, could it be considered permitting still?

These people are not ""smart cookies"" they do not know the slightest thing about civil law, or all that much at all really. But then again nor do I, I only turned 18 a few days ago, if I was under 18 I would have immediately called the police.

The socialist bit was mostly propaganda because, at the time, socialism was actually considered a good and modern thing by many if not most people in the world.  Certainly they were aiming at socialism, and they introduced some socialist policies, but in the early days mostly they inherited a feudalist system.  Their intial actions were to privatise land ownership to the peasantry in the countryside as the price of their support for them during the revolution, and to take over the factories and industries in the urban centres and set them up to be run by the government in a fairly similar manner to which they had been run before, but by a new large class of party bureaucrats and State functionaries rather than by private owners.  The idea was to industrialise the country and ""force"" capitalism.

For example, how long would it take to nationalise a single railway operator if there is a stake held by a citizen from a country subject to a BIT? We cannot forcefully expropriate these investments and, thus, it may take decades to achieve proper nationalisation or it would be cripplingly expensive. It's simply not going to happen.

Who cares about the wages?? We are 7th in the world by our finances, stop acting like we are Leeds or Doncaster Rovers, trying to stay afloat by buying out of contract players.. FFP is only a PR move, it doesn't stop the clubs from spending money, especially now with record TV revenues, sponsors and whatnot. I don't mean ""fuck finances, lets go buy messi"", we have to ensure we are in a good position for the future ofcourse, but we signed a record deal with Yokohama, we have more than enough money to improve our team, not downgrade it. Let's be honest, we only bought bench players so far, and neither are even upgrades from our previous bench players. We are going backwards, not upwards.. ""We were great last year"" is a ridiculous excuse and perfectly shows why there hasn't been any back-to-back PL winners since 2008. Even if we sign Stones, it's not like he's going to replace Cahill immediately.. another bench player, taking up the role of Zouma.

Just because we were good one year doesn't translate to success for the next year. Look at our team, and maybe I can name 5-6 players which can't be upgraded right now- Hazard, Costa, Matic, Courtois, Azpi, Terry. RW has been a problem for years, and while Willian is good, there are better alternatives. Cahill - numerous better options. Iva is getting older, and there better players in the world.

We fall behind the best clubs in the world because we don't act like one. Should Barca who won the treble last season just stop and not buy anyone - ""Because they were good last year"" ? By our logic, Bayern should not buy any players either because they have the league in the bag, and instead sell players to give other teams the advantage.. Barca signed a great player in Turan, Bayern got Vidal and D.Costa, City got Sterling, meanwhile Chelsea got Torres 2.0 and a back-up GK.. oh wait, almost forgot, Moses is back from loan, he'll be like a new signing.

We don't need Man Utd type of change, but we have to improve every time the transfer window is open. We are turning into Arsenal with our boasting of breaking-even, old players being ""like a new signing"".. let's hope atleast this doesn't turn into a trophy drought.",null,0,null,1437667326,null,0,false,0,ctdgts3,null,t3_3ebd9j,null,t1_ctdgts3,null,t1_ctddff4,null,null,null,1438123428,null,6,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,6,null

Sorry no that's a cop out. When ever someone says google it, you can be sure they're talking out their arse.

&gt;You mean like answering one reply out of six? 

Sorry but all you done is been very vague. So far your argument can be summed up as ""Shit happens because... reasons"" past that you pretty much got nothing.

 &gt;Sure, seeing the validity of the general consensus instead.

A ""general consensus"" which you shown no proof for.

&gt;Lots of people would like to hear it.

You yet to show it anymore than just your opinion. The fact that 113 nations apparently want Nuclear weapons prohibited and banned. Kind shows your general consensus to pretty much BS.

http://www.icanw.org/pledge/

http://www.un.org/disarmament/WMD/Nuclear/

&gt;**The United Nations has sought to eliminate such weapons ever since its establishment**. The first resolution adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1946 established a Commission to deal with problems related to the discovery of atomic energy among others. The Commission was to make proposals for, inter alia, the control of atomic energy to the extent necessary to ensure its use only for peaceful purposes. The resolution also decided that the Commission should make proposals for ""the elimination from national armaments of atomic weapons and of all other major weapons adaptable to mass destruction.""

Yeah that general consensus, must not include the UN :)

http://www.theguardian.com/news/defence-and-security-blog/2015/jun/02/nuclear-disarmament-forget-it

&gt;Perhaps it was not surprising. What is there newsworthy in hundreds of diplomats and scores of NGOs over a period of four weeks calling for nuclear disarmament, in effect praising motherhood and apple pie?

&gt;Yet the UN-sponsored conference in New York did not end in bland consensus. Far from it. It ended in disarray and angry exchanges.

&gt;Non-nuclear countries, ie most of the world, pointed the finger at the five “official” nuclear powers - the US, UK, Russia, China, and France.

Really doesn't add upto much of a general consensus when it seems to be most of the world vs the nuclear nations on wanting get rid of nuclear weapons. For something which apparently has a general consensus has stopped a ""world war III"" happening according to you. The world seems rather eager not to have them around. Bar the nuclear nations who want to keep their weapons

Irish sports and language or the struggle for independence is integral to that identity and we just don't feel it. How do you fix that?

So much has to change. Not even 60 years is enough. Especially when both sides never relent or concede. And we see that in this sub all the time even from younger members who were barely alive for Good Friday.

We are more likely to be economically stable in 60 years. I think that's a good and realistic goal for then.",null,1,null,1437669037,null,0,false,0,ctdhzk6,null,t3_3ebfxx,null,t1_ctdhzk6,null,t1_ctdckup,null,null,null,1438124270,null,2,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,2,null

null,false,DogBotherer,null,null,null,"&gt; Fascism is a really weird ideology to categorise preferring a mixed economy consisting of government run industries and private owned industries (quite like social democracies just with more slave labour and less democracy). 

All capitalist societies have ""mixed"" economies - they veer between wholly private capitalism and wholly State capitalism.

&gt;The thing is there are capitalist societies without grave, constant human rights violations and with freedom of speech, freedom of the press and political freedoms. Europe, for instance, covers all those areas. You cannot say the same for a socialist state even today.

It rather depends what you would consider a ""socialist State"".  Personally, I tend towards the idea that States and socialism don't mix because States always defend the people at the top of hierarchies, whether these be private owners or the political class.  But certainly there are social democratic States with extremely good human rights records, or say left leaning capitalist nations with records superior to right leaning ones.  As I've said in this thread or elsewhere very recently, one of the reasons it's very dubious to judge States attempting neutralist/non-aligned or anti-capitalist programmes according to the same criteria as Western-friendly capitalist ones, is that the former come under instant attack and powerful and well funded attempts to destabilise them, undermine them, propagandise them or all out attack them.  Even at the height of the cold war, the USSR/China were never as dedicated to this, as sophisticated at it, or as well-resourced to carry it out (and today of course, there can be no argument that both China and Russia are capitalist States in any event).",null,0,null,1437669193,null,0,false,0,ctdi3e9,null,t3_3ebmus,null,t1_ctdi3e9,null,t1_ctdhpkw,null,null,null,1438124367,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

MAD between us and another nuclear power ends the moment we disarm our arsenal. At that point, even though we might know beyond reasonable doubt that other powers would never use nukes against us, the fact that the possibility exists means big things.

It means that other nations have leverage on the U.K. Technically, we will become at the mercy of other nuclear powers. They *could* wipe us out, and this is a big psycological factor that could manifest in to small but, over time, extremely meaningful decisions. This indirectly puts the U.K. in a weaker position world-wide - Our place in trade and geopolitical discussions instantly goes down the drain.

For 2 decades Manchester United leveraged worldwide sponsorship and commercial opportunities whilst we were ""a local"" team with small minded executives that scoffed at ginger nuts Kenyon down the road who sat in his office doing deals whilst fergie built a dynasty. They were able to expand the stadium and bought success with world record transfers of the highest calibre players. They can still afford deals like they're doing now because they have a worldwide fan base which means they're sponsorship deals are incredibly high. Deals like Standard Chartered, Dunkin Doughnuts, Warrior, Subway. They're not to sell to Scousers or even English people but to build the club in Asia, America and worldwide. The stadium expansion will help pay the bills which are ever higher. Just look at the price of adding a few thousand seats now,  compared to the quote we had way back when the NWDF got us planning permission for the first new ground. Those deals increase the fan base, who logically want to come and watch the team too. Without those deals we won't be able to compete. If a pretty good striker is 32 million pounds these days and a kid with talent is 49million how do you expect the team to ever challenge again without worldwide support and tourists coming to watch a team they're passionate about. The tourists may not have the same culture as you, they may be quieter, more reserved, or down right shitting themselves at being in a piss hole area on the outskirts of a foreign city with 59,000 fully grown men baying for blood, a good proportion of those thinking to themselves what right has that tourist got to pay more than Ol'Jim can afford to come and watch my team. It's not fair.

All arms of the state were grandfathered in at the time the treaties were drawn up, with the proviso that if stuff is privatised it can't be reversed. (Look at the rapacious way the EU is trying to force Greece to privatise, for this reason).

You need to know that a lot of the rules were actually written by one Margaret Thatcher, when the Single European Act was drawn up.

She called a constitution convention in 1983 (after she won that election which she saw as giving her a mandate for European stuff) and browbeat the other Europeans into a whole host of neo-liberal stuff. The Single European Act was her idea - she's actually the person that changed the EEC into the EU - she's the mother of the EU. She was aided by Chancellor Kohl who was right-wing, and by France feeling they had to go along with what Germany wanted (what's new).

Pretty much all the rules about how corporations can locate themselves in the best areas come from the Single European Act, which Thatcher signed into law in 1985 and which came into effect in 1992. And she refused a referendum on it saying that Parliament was sovereign and she had just won an election on a pro-European platform (which was true).

That kind of thing is why oldies like me are so dismayed at the way the Corbynistas are saying ""it's OK if we don't win the 2020 election, the important thing is to oppose"". That thesis was tested to destruction in the 1980's - jumping up and down shouting *made no difference* other than tiring us out. As long as we were unelectable, Thatcher continued in her right-wing revolution. The only thing she got defeated on was the poll-tax - and that's because that affected *Tory voters* who were very upset.

Basically the best way to ""oppose"" is to get into government and then you have the power to reverse things. Blair for example reversed the exclusion to the Social Chapter and brought in a lot of protections for employees (protection against unfair dismissal, rights for part-time workers etc) - all of which are being slowly repealed and will be gone entirely if the Tories win again in 2020.

null,false,barejokez,null,null,null,"1. you mean if u/bozarius2 sells the house when his dad wants the money back. several reasons why that might not go the way they plan. or it might go perfectly, who knows.

2. let's run through this with some example numbers.  imagine the house in question is £500k.

scenario 1: (no dad help) Son has a £50k deposit and requires a £450k mortgage. that's a 90% LTV and quite possibly a struggle to get a bank on board.

scenario 2: (with dad) if Dad puts in £100k then he owns 20% of the house.  if he isn't named on the mortgage then the mortgage can only be secured against the remaining 80%. That's a £350k mortgage on £400k worth of property = 87.5% LTV = not a big improvement vs scenario 1.

scenario 3: (with dad on the mortgage) Instead Dad is named on the mortgage, and the LTV is 350/500 = 70% = decent improvement.  however, dad really should be contributing to the mortgage in this situation. That's because his investment is now leveraged by the debt. if (let's use the word ""if"", not ""will"") the house value goes up by 20% (to £600k) then the combined equity will increase from £150k to £250k. Dad owns 2/3 of this equity so his stake has grown from £100k to £167k (+67%).

if dad's share of the house isn't part of the mortgage (scenario 2), then IF the value goes up 20% his stake increases by... 20%. if he is going to benefit from the mortgage in this way then he should also contribute to interest payments. and the son should also pay rent to the dad.

i speak from experience here when i say that equity co-investment where the purchase is also funded with debt is fraught with arguments over the investment mechanism. if the house needs a new boiler, will dad stump up 20% of the cost or 67%?  or none?",null,0,null,1437669807,null,0,false,0,ctdiibe,null,t3_3e75j0,null,t1_ctdiibe,null,t1_ctdg237,null,null,null,1438124705,null,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1,null

The belief is that since Sakho started vs Felda United he will not play against Malaysia XI who are considered the stronger team (and the team all the starters are playing against).

My point is, it's very easy for people across the pond to pontificate about Ireland, without having to live with the consequences. A case and point is NORAID; it may seem cool and romantic to give cash to 'the boys', but no-one in New York or Boston ended up losing a brother or husband or son.

You're thinking on the right lines, but it isn't even that simple.

Members of the UN renounce the use of war ([Articles 2.3 and 2.4](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Charter_of_the_United_Nations#Article_2)). So legally there was no 'First Gulf War'. The military action in 1991 was UN action carried out by a subset of UN members authorized by the Security Council. As you say, the actual hostilities ceased with certain conditions. The UK and US argue that the original 1990-91 authorization remained in force and therefore that they were entitled to take further military action as a last resort. France and Russia disagreed. The body to settle such disputes is the Security Council, but with the Permanent Members split, any resolution would be vetoed.

null,false,NotManyBuses,null,null,null,"Tottenham is the perfect fictional club for a nice, clean transfer rumour. 

Spurs are certainly believable enough - we have a high player turnover. A volatile chairman who is known for being an incredibly shrewd businessman, and a seemingly endless revolving door of ins and outs and needs and wants for personnel. In Europe, we're relevant, always preparing for Thursday nights and a ""Champions League challenge."" We have a loyal readership. What's more, agents will want their players linked to clubs like Tottenham, even if their ability is more of a fit for West Brom or Aston Villa or Saint-Étienne. We're the zone for players who have some flaw which has kept them from the upper echelon, not the ones who need no introduction, the ones Chelsea and City buy. Perhaps one day they were linked to a Sky 4 club, and their stature has diminished, artificially. Perhaps their stock has dropped like a stone, skipping above the water before succumbing to gravity. But it's more flattering to be linked with *Tottenham* than with Swansea City and Watford.

We're a London side with history who play generally nice football, with enough renown to make a reader pause, if only momentarily. Enough to give our name some slight inflection in their voice ""Oh, he's been linked to *Tottenham*? Huh."" and for a millisecond, they can see the player holding a lily-white jersey, adapting to London, sending social media posts of vacuous excitement to join the club, culminating in them growing a shit haircut. They can see the stories of ""Spurs' European Thursdays"" with the player in an unflattering pose in the header of the article. They can see the player eventually flattering to deceive or pandering for a move to a richer club, possibly a move home. And then the moment passes, and the reader gets back to the sea of information that is the internet and social media. Perhaps he mentions it to his mates, but probably not. It's only a tenuous link to *Tottenham*, right?

And yet, it can't be dismissed either, because it's Tottenham, and it's somewhat believable. And it carries hope for all parties involved - the promise of a big money move, the promise of London for the player. The promise of an exciting signing for the supporters desperate for success. The hope of doing business. Links to Tottenham mirror those people at the grocery who meet your eye for a couple seconds. The ones who you're sure offer an interesting perspective on life, a decent laugh, perhaps an opportunity to add to your personal character. Ethereal in nature and most likely leading to nothing, never to be seen again, but enough to engage your attention, enrapture you for just a second. It's these people which keep day-to-day life sane. The tiny bits of hope found in a crumpled up receipt from a shop you recognize, a song which you've never heard before and yet the melody seems familiar, the momentary things which spark contemplation in those with enough pride to still believe there is meaning to be found in this world.

Maybe that's what life is for - transfer links to Tottenham.

No they don't in fact they embolden leaders to be more aggressive, to use them as leverage, which has very nearly led to nuclear war on more than one occasion. Cuba is the prime example - without nuclear weapons as a form of diplomatic leverage the whole thing would never have happened.

&gt; If you argue against that, you are insane.

Absolutely horseshit. You dismiss criticism as ""anyone who doesn't take my point of view is insane"" and you don't deserve to have your opinion taken seriously.

&gt; International politics before nuclear weapons seems to argue for that.

Since post war international politics has been just as unstable as pre-war in many ways, and since it was basically pure luck rather than the inherent stability of nuclear annhilation that kept the peace (see Robert McNamara's comments on this topic) I think you're on very shaky ground.

If you believe in peace you need a large, politically powerful, anti-war movement to pressure states into abandoning imperialist and war-like policies, not nuclear weapons, which only make this imperial game-playing even more dangerous.

I'd also recommend reading Eric Schlossers Command and Control about the history of near-misses and nuclear accidents that have happened in the west. Their very presence is unsafe and puts people at risk even at times when the world is relatively peaceful. Here's a good clip of him putting forward his case - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWySgyWmrcg

The truth is in the world of competing nationalism and imperial competition for resources war is always possible, if not likely, and the presense of nuclear weapons does nothing at all to mitigate that. If anything it excascerbates it - thank god that Ukraine disarmed in the 1990's as if they hadn't there's a very good chance there'd have been a nuclear conflict over Crimea last year.",null,0,null,1437671203,null,0,1437671636,0,ctdjher,null,t3_3ea8go,null,t1_ctdjher,null,t1_ctdiv92,null,null,null,1438125297,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

null,false,lovocosplay,null,null,null,"Well, like I've said, I've only gone one other time so I'm no expert, but here are some things that might be helpful:

No Cosplay Friday /

If you're planning on cosplaying, I highly recommend that you go in street clothes on Friday, or at least part of Friday. That way, you can get from A to B quickly, get in and out of the vendor areas smoothly (after you've bought all of your swag, of course), and get an overall lay of the land, as well as an idea of what the crowds are like inside. When I went last year, I went in cosplay on Friday and I really wished that I hadn't. I was stopped for pictures constantly. My costume was big and bulky, so much so I almost couldn't enter the vendor areas. Because of the pictures and the shoulder-to-shoulder crowds often found inside the hotels, it took me upwards of 45-55 minutes to get from A to B. As a result, I was really disorientated all weekend and I never really got a solid idea of the entire con's layout. 


High Congestion = High Travel Time /

If you skipped my first point, prepare yourself for shoulder-to-shoulder crowds inside, and allot yourself at least 30 minutes to get from A to B especially if you're moving to another hotel. Seriously. I'm not kidding. Dragon Con drew about 70k people last year, and I'm pretty sure that that only accounted for the number of tickets purchased. You do not need a pass to enter the host hotels, meaning that there were probably a lot more people than that hanging around. Imagine 70-90k people trying to get in elevators, going up/down escalators, navigating hallways, using restrooms; there are lines for _all_ of these things.


Schedule Yo Shit Before Con /

With such high travel time involved and with such a huge number of things to do, it's critical that you look at the schedule beforehand and plan out the things that you want to do. Dragon Con releases an Apple/Android app that is very useful _before_ con (see more below); @DragonCon on Twitter will announce when it's ready, which should be soon. Get to the things you want to do at least an hour ahead of time. Yes, I'm serious. I hate to keep repeating myself, but the lines are a real problem at this con. People start lining up way early for just about everything. For big events, like the cosplay contest, plan to arrive at least two hours early. That being said, be realistic when picking things to go to. You'll probably be able to go to two, maybe three things per day after you've allotted for travel time, waiting in line, getting food, going to the bathroom, etc.


Horrible Cell Service /

Cell/data/wifi signal is absolute shit. Save all event information you need on your phone's calendar because the app freezes a lot during the con. Plan with your friends how you will find each other if/when you get separated and you can't use your phones to find one another. 


Cosplay Groups and Photo Shoots: All on Facebook /

There is pretty much a Facebook group for every cosplay niche. If you want to participate in or go to a photo shoot, this Facebook group manages the schedule for those: https://www.facebook.com/groups/dconphotos/. By photo shoot, I mean a lot of cosplayers of a particular niche all in one place; this might be the easiest way to see a lot of great cosplay all at once.


The Food Court Saves Lives /

The food court in the Peachtree Center (http://dragon-con.pbworks.com/w/page/27543261/Peachtree%20Center) is pretty much the only place to get food at con. Seriously, don't waste your time wandering around. 


Avoid Con Crud /

Con crud, aka getting sick, is common. Boost your immune system before/during the con with orange juice or other vitamin supplements. Wash your hands a lot. Stay hydrated.


Use Common Sense /

Bring a water bottle. Maybe some protein bars. If you're drinking, don't be stupid about it. A backpack is a great idea. Don't throw glass beer bottles off of one of the Marriott tiers / beware of falling beer bottles (yes, someone was dumb enough to do this last year).


Have Fun /

It's a four-day party. Make friends. Crash a room party.

Given the way the population of Wales is being changed it is inevitable that the 'Welsh only' will decrease but they will still remain as the clear relative majority overall.

What is most worrying about this is the age of the incomers and the strain this is putting on the Welsh NHS. It's no wonder it is cracking at the seams but no politician has the balls to say it because they are too scared of being called racist.

the vision of slowly building up a football empire: 
step 1: buy youth talent, but most importantly, discover and sign upcoming English talents.

Pros: if you buy enough talent, a larger number of them will turn out to be stars, if the talent happen to be from England, then it means huge revenue on a potential sale, dude to rules of home grown players.

cons: if they are not successful, then they are not going to sell for much.

added to that is our decision to not spend to much on young talent, its more important to buy many, than look for the right one.

Step 2: how to reach a top four position, when we potentially have to sell our best players from time to time, you buy talent that exceeds the previous once in talent, in order to challenge previously bought talent, to increase there own skills.
(of course we could have cheated a bit by keeping Suarez, but...)

Step 3: Securing Top 4, if we can establish getting the team put together in such a way, that we will always be a challenge to any team, then we can add 1 or 2 Top players to or squad, (this could potentially whit a little luck be next summer)

unless we have to repeat step 3 once again, i have no doubt in the plans for the future, but i have no clue when we will reach our goal, but the main goal is the number 1 position.

Manchester: Large city with famous red brick architecture. Very cosmopolitan and full of IT startups and big name companies you will have heard of. The large number of universities (and therefore students) encourages lots of new companies and also means cheap accommodation is easy to find (I lived in Hulme at ~£280 a month, it was very nice). There is a lot of interesting art and culture going on, especially in the Northern Quarter (where they filmed Captain America among other things). It's a bustling busy city full of wonderful people and only 2h10 on the train to London if you ever get bored of what Manchester has to offer. Also the beer scene is pretty amazing (I can recommend numerous amazing pubs).

Bristol: Smaller than Manchester but still a lively city with historic architecture (most notably the Clifton Suspension Bridge). Still a student-y town being further South and West means Bristol is more 'quaint' and what, I imagine, people think a lot of British cities are like who have never visited the UK. Accomodation is more expensive being in the South but with student housing around I'm sure you can still find deals. I believe IT based jobs are pretty common around their too though the city is smaller than Manchester.* Lots of hills so the city will keep you fit. A brilliant place to cultivate a love of cider.

*To be fair the UK has a very strong IT industry, you'll probably find good work wherever.

We had **a ton** of scoring chances. And not just hopeful shots from the 18, but shots on an open net from the 6 or 12. We just couldn't finish them. Remy, Oscar, Costa all missed gimme goals, some even missed multiple, and we easily could have scored 6 or more goals.

Our defense is typically our strong point, but they seemed to lack chemistry and focus last night. I'm not worried about them at all though. They'll get back to form and be the dominant defense they're used to being. There's no reason to think they won't.

I was specifically impressed with Moses. While I'm also a big believer in Cuadrado being able to turn things around in the fall, Moses could be valuable depth for us.

I can't wait to see what we can do with some extra players on Saturday, specifically Falcao and Cuadrado. I don't expect much, but I still would love to see them put a few in the net.

Every economic system that has ever existed and will ever exist can be described as ""mixed"" to some extent so the term is meaningless except in comparison to the soviet model.
However, as no one has  advocated a soviet model for over 50 years (including soviets), the point is somewhat moot.

Government spending money is not socialism and it never has been. Even taxation isn't really socialist as its really just a means of offsetting the fact that companies externalise costs (e.g. they need educated workers that receive healthcare, or they could pollute the environment and not pay for it). Social democracy is just the admission that these externalities exist and that not paying for them actually damages the interests of capital. For example, if you don't pay for people to go to school you really don't have a leg to stand on when they can't read a sign that says ""private land. Keep out"".

Sturridge would be capable in the wide position, as would Origi and maybe Ings. Balo and Benteke I wouldn't want to see there though. 

Ideally if we wanted to play 4-3-3 the front three would be made up of Sturridge - Benteke - and one of Origi/ Lallana / Ibe / Ings or something like that.

Yes they would. There's no way any Russian leader could sit back idly and watch Russian speaking, ethnically and culturally Russian people being slaughtered by the Kiev regime without being overthrown himself. It would be political suicide for any Russian leader to go down in history as the man who lost Crimea to the west. In such a situation a nuclear war would be the preferable option and rationally that's what would've happened. The same logic was at work with the near-miss we had in Cuba. God knows why people see that as some sort of ideal we should live up to.

Same with Crimea - Russia has been willing to go to war with *anyone* for control over the Crimea since the 1780's! The Turks, the Germans, the British, the Ukraine, they see that as not only a region of deep strategic value but one of great emotional and cultural significance as well. They could no more turn their backs on the people in Donbass and Crimea that we could if Northern Irish loyalists were under attack in Belfast or if some tiny little island with a small number of British expats living there in the south Atlantic were under attack...

And even if they didn't, those seperatists would've fought on anyway. They weren't prepared to accept the overthrow of the president they voted for by a western sponsored coup.

Is there though?

You seem to be repositioning their arguments. You are taking the *this* and *that* approach to an entirely more complex debate. What happened to the middle ground?

I consider myself a libertarian. I think the state should be small and out of the way *in general*. That doesn't mean it should be unconditional which is like how you're trying to frame us. State involvement should be tailored to the situation and not like the blanket withdrawal you accuse us of adopting. You're only recognising the extremes without realising that we're not *completely* at one end of the spectrum.

People are often libertarian because they don't trust the state with their power or money. They are often unaccountable. They often lack transparency. They are often bureaucratic. They seem often in bed and bought. They often spend recklessly. They often screw with foreign affairs. They are often inefficient. All of these kind of tie in with each other. Strong public reform would help soothe libertarianism to a degree. I personally find that it's a fair stance to take.

&gt;***it seemed UKIP were trying to position themselves as a British Libertarian Party before they realised people liked state services like the NHS** and taxes on the wealthy.*

It seems like most of UKIP like the NHS in my opinion. We think it needs discussion and reform though.

&gt;*it seemed UKIP were trying to position themselves as a British Libertarian Party before **they realised people like**d state services like the NHS and **taxes on the wealthy.***

I personally dislike this what has been described as an ""anti-success"" culture in the UK. I'd describe my stance as one of standards, *but* success. I believe UKIP adopts this too and that is the culture they have taken up to challenge. They have set out to tackle incompetence, accountability, inefficiency and priorities (subjective) which have positioned them against the status quo. They want a country where everyone can thrive, where there is a safety net but not lifestyle and most importantly, where people aren't shamed for getting somewhere.

No they would've launched nuclear weapons rather than lose Crimea, absolutely.

The issue I have is how do you/me/anyone decide what international actions need accountability and how far back you go? The Middle East has been a cauldron for a very long time....where do you draw the line at chasing Britain's involvement. Iraq 1, Iraq 2, Afghanistan, Yemen in the Seventies (I think), our involvement in the creation of borders after WW2? Depending on who you ask you will get a different answer and you won't even get agreement on what was right or wrong.

Would you also propose going after all the other sides who have been involved in the Middle East?

There are many Countries with checkered pasts. If you want to go after the UK then also go after all the other Countries with problematic histories. Where do you draw the line?

null,false,moldy_walrus,lfc12,,null,"Here's my take on the CB situation. 

Skrtel, Sakho, and Lovren are all good CBs, and could all start for a champions league team. None of them are incredible, but they're all well above average. They're all at a very similar skill level, which makes choosing a starting 2 pretty difficult

This could be wrong, but I believe that unlike midfield and attack, rotating players in and out of the starting back line can be harmful. Having stability and chemistry among those 4 is incredibly important. 

My personal pick for starting CBs would be these two (Sakho and Skrtel). Sakho is probably our most consistant and sound CB, while Skrtel is our most vocal, motivating, and our best threat during corners. I think his fireyness (is that a word?) could really help our young fullbacks. He makes mistakes at times, but I think he more than makes up for it in the positives he brings to the table.

That leaves Lovren. Unlike some poeple here, I want to keep all 3 of our CBs. I don't see why one has to go. Lovren provides great cover for the other 2 if one gets injured/needs a rest, and he provides competition to prevent the starters from getting too complacent. 

I also think that in the near future, we might start seeing a decline in Skrtels play due to age (which might effect him earlier than other CBs because of his style of play). As this happens, Lovren could take over his role as the vocal leader of the back line.

Obviously nothing will pan out this way at all and we'll prob have a completely different squad in 2 years...but that's just my 2 cents. ",null,0,null,1437675752,null,0,false,0,ctdmp25,null,t3_3ebqre,null,t1_ctdmp25,null,t3_3ebqre,null,null,null,1438127172,null,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null

With what I've heard of Corbyn, he would be pushing my tax bill up closer to 50% of my earnings. At that point I can pay less tax living in Europe and have a better quality of life.

If any government looked to bump my tax rate to 50% whilst not removing existing taxes such as council tax, national insurance, alcohol duties or car tax then its unreasonable. In Europe they pay a higher amount of tax when we look at percentages of income tax but have significantly lower 'hidden' taxes. 

I could move to Europe, pay more in income tax but still have far more money in my pocket. As much as I love the UK, I will not stay here forever if I can build a future here.
