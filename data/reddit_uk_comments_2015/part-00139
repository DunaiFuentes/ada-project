Have you not heard of the **Curse of Thursday Football** (lord knows the BBC mention it every time we play a EL game). 

Our results the weekend following a European Thursday game are *appalling*. 

I don't have the stats for it as I'm in bed drifting off and it's not an excuse (sometimes we play poorly regardless) and if we want CL we need to be able to hack the admittedly less strenuous trips but against harder opposition. But I think it's a valid complaint. 

We do need EL though from a financial stand point. I'm sure someone can show the figures. Also, we get an extra £2million for every place in the EPL we finish to a higher result is just financially better. 

Also, if we take it as 'fact' that: 

* Having the CL spot attracts CL quality players to your team

* We can say having the EL attracts EL quality players

* We can then say that no EL means we can only attract players not good enough for the EL? 

Aka, using this logic (which isn't perfect but whatever) to improve, we need EL, get EL players, and put them in a CL spot team.",null,0,null,1428978656,null,0,1428979021,0,cqbkck7,null,t3_32i417,null,t1_cqbkck7,null,t3_32i417,null,null,null,1432377148,null,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3,null

I'd rather a steady progression up to the Premier League in order to get us stabilised in that league (almost like what Stoke have done) than have a one off season where we get beat a lot because we're not quite ready.

The real problem is that for the most part crop cultivation is a closed system. For every yield you produce on a field it becomes more difficult to produce again, things like crop rotation/GMO/pesitcides management etc and lengthend the life time of the soil and crop production, however climate change is increasing desertification of arable land as well as land lost due to increased salination of fresh water sources and land erosion. This is expediating a drop in the amount of crop yields.

Now i believe we will find a way to solve this problem in the long long term, but in the short term with population growth still rising by slowing climate change we put less of a burden on the food supply of the world and give ourselves more of a fighting change to ensure minimal suffering of vast swathes of the human race.",null,0,null,1428980791,null,0,false,0,cqblk13,null,t3_32cuqy,null,t1_cqblk13,null,t1_cqazrf4,null,null,null,1432377718,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Compare this to Origi's 27 league appearances, most of which were starts.  He has so far managed 7 goals in the league, including a hat trick recently.  
Origi plays quite often for the Belgian National Team, whereas Borini does not get a sniff for Italy.  
Not to mention Origi is only turning 20, compared to a 24 year old Borini.  Origi just seems a better fit for our squad, he has time on his side and he is physically superior to Borini in terms of height, strength and pace.  
I personally think this will be Borini's last season in a Liverpool shirt.

Are you wishing to demonise our support, do their work for them?

The song has been around for years. It's in bad taste, and it rarely does the rounds, but don't buy into the grief and sympathy fest that United and their fans peddle.

If you've ever actually been to a derby United fans do the fabled 'Munich plane gesture' to us more than our own boneheads do to them. They did it on Sunday as well, I saw a few.

They do it for a reaction, possibly to provoke a response and then feign outrage.

The Munich chants are much less common now, because the vast majority of us know they're moronic and in bad taste.

United as a club however effectively became who they are today thanks to the Munich air disaster. They used it as a marketing tool for decades, while providing little to no support for the families of their dead players - even evicting them from their homes.

That's why people often use it to bash them over the head with, although there's clearly no excuse for that. Especially specifically chanting about the deaths of players.

Plus, clearly, when we were genuinely shit it's the only thing some of our fans could use against United fans to get a reaction. That's when 'relations' were most strained between the two fanbases, when they were one of the most successful clubs in Europe while taking great delight in ridiculing us and our lows in league 1 - that was probably the period when the chants were most common.

Those days have passed however, and chants like this are extremely rare.

What you see in this video is just a small group of young lads in the coach park opposite the ground, probably angry post match, and hurling insults back and forth with the United fans on the other side of the fence.

We got spanked, and had nothing to cheer about, so the boneheads bring out the lowest form of insult as a means to counter the jibes about the result from reds.

That's the rationale behind this scene, what little rationale there is.

null,false,macky909,null,null,null,"I want to be clear with my opinion here: I want to be in the Europa League, I do think the benefits outweigh the cons. But I'm gonna play devil's advocate here to just open up discussion.

The problem is that we spend a few days traveling to far parts of Europe and spending the majority of the week settling and preparing for the game, and we only have 1-2 full days before we're back in the Premier League playing again. We've seen how often we get drained after long European excursions, and tbh games that are high intensity always lead to a next game hangover for us for some reason (Chelsea win followed by Crystal Palace defeat, NLD win followed Liverpool loss/West Ham tie). But imagine coming back with 3-4 days of rest from a far country, it would be a lot less stressful as a player.

It also depends on what you give your priority. I recall the season (2011-12) where Redknapp played almost reserves exclusively in the Europa league because he gave the league priority. This did help us, we were in the top 3 for the majority of the season before the England job completely turned his head and affected the team. In my opinion, Redknapp should've been challenging for the title easily with the squad we had at the time (not really here or there, just my opinion). Now with AVB's first season, we did make a good European run as well while only ending up one point behind fourth, but let's look at one important thing: we drew against Everton in between the legs of the Basel tie, which, along with a loss to Fulham and draw against Wigan, would definitely play their part as to why we missed out. I also want to point out that we had that post intense game hangover as well that season - NLD victory in March followed by losses against Liverpool and Fulham.

My point is it really comes down how do we prevent these hangovers after emotional or intense games? We also have an incredibly annoying habit of taking our foot off the gas during late February to mid April since the Champions League season.

2010-11: Late February to early May had a record of 1 win, 6 draws, 3 losses.

2011-12: Late February to end of April had a record of 2 wins, 3 draws, 5 losses, all starting from a massive second half capitulation in the NLD. 

2012-13: NLD win in early March followed by two preventable losses against Liverpool (2 ridiculous mistakes led to goals) and Fulham, with draws against Everton (in b/w Europa games) and Wigan! (who were relegated).

2013-14 (I know it was never really in the cards, but damn it I had hope for a second after we beat United on New Years!): Timmy having only dropped points twice until late February, goes on to lose 3 of the next 4 games in March...again, though, we weren't ever close to being in the hunt.

I know this is a little off topic, but it's something I've noticed. We have been lacking always at this time of the year, and we have a habit of canceling huge wins with stupid losses in the next game. Maybe we should limit the amount of games in our season to challenge for fourth, but honestly that isn't a very Spurs way to go about it as I really do think this squad with the right personnel changes in the summer can challenge the Europa league next season.

&gt; economic growth from a new industry and subsequent taxation 

The only way that this would be important enough to impact the debate would be if exise duties were placed on all drugs similar to alcohol. In that case you admit that we should discourage people from using drugs and they are bad.

&gt; Reduction in accidental deaths due to improved drug quality and transparency of substances  

Mmh not necessarily. Colorado has seen a massive proliferation of weed because the government legitimised it and because all sorts of new users were trying it. There were then more vehicle accidents, children taking the drug and people just freaking out because they took too much. If we suddenly unleashed harder drugs on the public then we would certainly see more deaths because nobody would understand how to use them properly and they wouldn't know social conventions. 

&gt; Drug addicts receive treatment instead of a sentence that makes finding work extremely hard making them a burden to society

Lots of needle exchange programmes, drug treatment programmes, amnesty programs. If you get caught for possession, you're not really going get a fine and a policie caution, not a jail sentence. 

&gt; Reduction in prescription overdoses

Where did this come from? 

&gt; The availability of drugs other than alcohol will lead to a reduction in alcohol related crime and accidents (IMO) 

And just subsitute it for another kind of crime? Acid is a different beast to weed, which is different to stims, which are different to alcohol. You use them for different purposes and the liklihood is that people will mix them with alcohol. 

&gt; Decreases the availability of these drugs for children  

No way, edibles might even get banned in Colorado! I seriously doubt that an average 15 year old could get his hands on MDMA easily as it is right now. If it was legalised, he could just take some from daddy's cabinet. 


Some other problems: 

- Big drug companies akin to big tobacco 

Tobacco and alcohol companies make most of their money off frequent users. Drug companies would try and do the same, addiction would be in their every interest. 

- Drug tourism 

The Dutch hate us. Can you imagine people across Europe coming to your town for stag doos? You might say it brings in money but I don't think that measures with the shame that comes with being a drug haven. 

- People are stupid 

Out of the people I know, loads would get PTSD from bad trips. It's easy to die from plenty of other drugs too and it would be hard to caution them 

- Public nuisances 

I get freaked out by meth-heads and people on coke. Day time users would make things more dangerous as oppose to drunks that are mostly confined 

- Dependency 

It's absolutely awful to see people get hooked on drugs. As it is, drug use is falling so why take the risk?

- Drugs will affect the poorest the most 

You would only resort to drugs if your life was so stressful you needed to escape. Cigs are smoked by poor people and their health and income are taxed because of it. Drug legalisation would increase drug usage and thus entrench itself in certain communities. Working-class mothers would be more likely to, say smoke weed during pregnancy thus genetically altering the lives of kids. This would clearly exasperate inequality.

I've seen the best and worst times on and off the pitch over these years. I will admit that I use to participate in singing this shite song when I was on the piss and much younger than I am now. It was just different in those days. 

The rags have so many scars in their history that I'd be here for hours to identify them all. We can start with their continued songs mocking the Hillsborough tragedy, which is why they are just being twats when they moan about how awful a small section of our support is for singing the moronic Munich song. Songs and chants are simply words and words have never injured or killed anyone. I've never witnessed a song or chant kick the fuck out of a lad when he's down on his back. I have witnessed their scum firm do that though and they do it to people who aren't interested in being a hooligan. They have always been known as the ones who attack regular supporters. That is far worse than any song. I can go on but it would be too long. I condemn this stupid song and any twat singing it deserves to be slapped.",null,0,null,1428989834,null,0,false,0,cqbpp8z,null,t3_32ittd,null,t1_cqbpp8z,null,t1_cqbn9jx,null,null,null,1432379671,null,1,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,1,null

It is the primary driver, to the point where almost all other check boxes are rendered irrelevant. Especially in a class based society like the UK. 

&gt;it's a common misunderstanding that people in positions of privilege 'ought' to feel guilty/ashamed of said privilege

Honestly I've seen enough of it that I genuinely don't believe it to be a misunderstanding *at all*, but rather a deliberate ploy by very unpleasant people to continue to be unpleasant and do so completely consequence free. But I will concede I may well be cynical about this. 

&gt;put another way: people don't choose to be born men (or straight, or white, etc) and so can't reasonably be held personally responsibly for benefiting from privilege.

It is such a pity imho, that sociological tools for shorthand discussions of this nature are so often perverted to mean just that. 

&gt;You could argue that it is their responsibility to help dismantle these systems, though.

null,false,Dennis-Wise,EN,england,null,"Well Mourinho has more or less implied that this is a one season thing because he promised players like RLC will play a lot more next season. Whether or not he sticks to his word is something we don't really know. 

There was a lot of pressure on Mourinho to win the league this year. He was given the opportunity over the summer to polish and fill the gaps of the unfinished product of last season and I can understand why he wouldn't want to take many risks with youth players. He sees them train and play more than anyone, if he doesn't think they're ready for first team play then I can understand why he's sticking with the strongest squad. This team is Mourinho's team, he's sold several key players including Luiz, Mata, De Bruyne and Schurrle and spent big money on other players, if he doesn't win the league this year it could get ugly for him. He needs to prove he made the right changes. 

Winning the league this year will relieve a lot of pressure from him especially from Abramovic, So I think in the balance of the focus of winning the league and the focus on youth development and the future was a bit lopsided for this season more so because of how much Mourinho wants to win the title this season. To solidify himself and build a foundation to construct upon. 

I expect to see at least a *bit* more focus on playing our youth next season, but if Mourinho doesn't feel that they're good enough to play and feels we'd be better off bringing young talent from other places ,then it will just have to wait until our youth prove worthy enough by Mourinho's standards.

1) In RE classes (1 hour a week, then I think at GCSE it was like an hour and half?), the RE teachers would be open about whether they were religious but religion was always taught to us as though we had never heard of it before. We weren't expected to know anything already and it also wasn't forced upon us in any way. 

2) In assembly (like twice a month?) it would finish with a college prayer. The first line had God in it, then there were about another 10 or so lines but they were really were just about how the ethos of our school was to include everybody and work together despite differences and backgrounds. If they took the first line our it would just be an extended motto about how the school is all about inclusivity. We were also reminded a few times throughout the year that we didn't have to say it if we don't want to.

On top of that, any discrimination like sectarianism received a zero tolerance approach from staff. But it wasn't even that big a deal because there really was no sectarianism. I didn't really know who was catholic or protestant in my year til I was about 5th year because it really wasn't a thing at all.

Plus I went to catholic grammar school in lower sixth (because I really wanted to do Music A Level but it was the only A Level that my school didn't offer) but I ended up transferring back because I found that I performed a lot better in the integrated environment.

null,false,HolySheesh,null,null,null,"OK here we go. I am 18 years old, living in the Brighton area and on May the 7th I'll be voting Conservative.

The main reason I will be voting Conservative is because I believe that the economic plan they have put out is viable, working and will ensure that by the time I graduate in 2018 there will be jobs that I actually want to do as a career out there.

I believe that the strong economic plan put forward will help us to spend more on the NHS (which the government did for every year of this last parliament and have pledged to do again for the next parliament), it will keep us more secure from the extremely un-predictable economic situation of the EU and that one day I might be able to buy one of the 200,000+ homes they've pledged to build by 2020 or be one of the 1.3 million tenants who have used help to buy.

In my opinion the Labour plan is outdated, relying too heavily on borrowing and would cripple the economic growth that has seen us become the fastest growing economy in the EU. I believe that Labour is also endangering the NHS by having a weak economy. There are more than 60 million of us living in the U.K., and IMO it is common sense that we need a good working economy to make sure that we can fund the NHS for everybody. I believe that the Labour party will ruin this and cause even more danger and disruption to our NHS.

Lastly, I support an EU referendum. I would vote to stay in the EU and I think it would be a strong success in my favour and that would shut up 1 particular party. Regardless, I think we should also go ahead with it because nobody in this country that was born after the 5th of June 1957 has been consulted in a national referendum on our membership and I don't think that is right or democratic.

I love the guy, and when he leaves and complains about the club not giving him any playing time, not being given a fair chance, ill take his side and say brendan got it all wrong.

I want to see him get a good run of starts before anyone makes their mind up on him. Cant help but feel sorry for him, we play one up top so theres only one striker getting a game, and then when he's injured we play a winger who isnt exactly lethal infront of goal. The kid knows he can do it given the chance, he stayed to prove that to everyone.

I like him because he's a 'proper striker', he doesnt wander back looking to get into the game, and if you watch him his movement is really good but our players arent used to playing with someone making thoes kind of runs so the service he was getting last night was abysmal. with better final passes he could have had a couple last night.

Sorry but if you think the cost of house prices is related to anything other than there not being enough built then you are horribly wrong.

&gt;If this means providing insentives for OAPs to move to hull then so be it

I don't think it's right to incentivize people to live anywhere...  they own the house so let them get on with it.  Your view of the world is quite blinkered in that you are ignoring the fact that there are already natural incentives for older people to move away.  Actually punishing people for wanting to live where they live is just immoral...

&gt;The size of land banks that some developers are sitting on suggest that that is unlikely

Moron.  They're speculating, because house prices seem to be terminally going up, they have no reason to be in any real hurry to build.  Think about why something may be the case next time.

&gt;peak private sector building rate

Where did you get this statistic from?  

&gt;but planning regulations are less of an issue there

Do you lack awareness?  This is the single biggest issue.  We have a stupid amount of empty land in this country, but the difference in the cost of land and the cost of land with planning permission to build is on the order of a factor of ten.  The fact that planning permission costs this much can only ever push the price of housing up.

&gt;In what way is it unfair? On a practical level I expect you will find most houses inherited by the middle class are converted to cash or are let out rather than being lived in by the person inheriting them. Someone inheriting over £600k can afford a fairly significant tax bill.

If I work all my life so that I can leave something behind, why can't I?  Why do you have a right to my money when I earn it and then my money when I die?  It was only ever supposed to target the upper class, now it targets the middle class as well.  You should never target the middle class in any real way because every single person in this country can reasonably aspire to become middle class.  Very few people can reasonably aspire to be upper class however.

Not to mention of course that the state directly benefits from the increase in housing prices.  Why would they care to lower house prices when they are benefiting from more and more houses getting included in the death tax?  Why can't you see more than what is at face value?

If you don't believe this then here's an interesting little fact: during **every single Labour government ever there has been a rise in unemployment**. That *is* statistically significant.

Austerity has never worked.  History does not have any evidence that cutting budgets and running at a surplus has ever worked.

The NHS Support Federation found that 70% of NHS contracts awarded between April 2013 and April 2014 have gone to the private sector, covering every aspect of the patient journey including diagnosis, treatment and on-going healthcare. It also found a 30% rise in adverts inviting bids from the private sector and charities.

[Here is the growth in privatisation mapped](http://www.nhsforsale.info/mapping-privatisation.html)

A more simple representation is in 2011 to 2012 total growth in Non NHS spending was 10.7% compared to 3.5% growth in total spending.  This shows that the privatised services are growing at a much faster pace than the rest of the NHS.

[Here is an example of a £1.2Billion privatisation of end of life cancer treatment privatisation](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/16/nhs-privatisation-biggest-history-staffordshire-cancer) that has occured with no patient or public consultation.

But I like to think that truthful voting helps the long term positive outcome far more than tactical voting. Tactical voting encourages getting stuck in a ""rut"" over a series of elections, where your favoured party is liked far more than they are chosen due to their perceived short-term chances. If voters at least show their support each election for these parties, they can act on that support, perhaps by targeting constituencies differently, securing better funding, or just plain encouragement.

In the short-term, giving your preferred party the vote might help nothing and feel like a waste.

This was written in 2008, but it gives you a glimpse into what Putin has done right:

&gt;The raw data is impressive. The eight years of Putin’s presidency saw a doubling of
living standards, a 70 percent increase in GDP, the paying down of nearly all Russia’s foreign sovereign debts, and the accumulation of a war-chest of $402 billion foreign currency reserves as of March 2008. In current dollar prices, GDP went from $200 billion in 1999 to $1.26 trillion in 2007. Russia moved up from being the 20th largest economy in the world to the seventh. The World Bank estimates the Gross National Income per capita at $5,780 in 2006, with a GNI of $823 billion. (World Bank 2007) 

[Putins Economic Record - P. Rutland](http://prutland.web.wesleyan.edu/Documents/Putin's%20record.pdf)

Economic sanctions and the oil crash have hampered Russia, causing the rouble to fall in value and GDP to shrink, despite this though ~85% of Russians still think Putin is doing a good job.

&gt;Surveys by Levada, a Moscow-based polling company, indicate that 85 percent of people still think he is doing a good job. In his annual address to the nation this month, Putin warned that tougher times lay ahead, but said that Russia’s economy would bounce back within two years.

I don't know much about the racism in Russia, but I don't assume it's much more racist than many other Eastern European or Asian countries. The spotlight is just on Russia right now because of their role in Ukraine. I don't see documentaries of someone examining the inherent racism/classism in Chinese society, or the damaging effects of the caste system in India, or the resurgence of Neo-Nazi groups in some Eastern European countries. Those would all be easy targets as well, so why don't we talk about them? Because those guys aren't on our radar right now like Russia is.

null,false,StoriesToBeTold,null,null,null,"The rate of inflation faced by households has fallen to its lowest level on record. The Consumer Prices Index, which measures changes in the prices of the goods and services bought by households, was unchanged in the year to February 2015, down from 0.3% in the year to January.

This means that a basket of goods and services that cost £100.00 in February 2014 would have still cost £100.00 in February 2015. While some prices (such as for motor fuels and food) are lower than they were a year ago, others (such as for clothing and rents) are higher. Prices of motor fuels and food have now fallen or remained unchanged on the year for 18 and 10 consecutive months respectively and in February, the 12-month rates for both groups were the lowest on record. Taken together, motor fuels and food price changes reduced the CPI 12-month rate by approximately 0.9 percentage points in the year to February.

The slowdown in the 12-month rate between January and February came from price movements for a range of recreational goods (particularly data processing equipment, books and games, toys and hobbies), food and furniture and furnishings.

The core inflation rate – the rate of inflation excluding goods with volatile price movements, notably energy, food, alcohol and tobacco – was 1.2% in February, 1.2 percentage points higher than overall inflation. As in most recent months, this indicates that most of the downward pull on inflation has come from price movements for goods excluded from the core calculation, notably motor fuel and food.

null,false,Messisfoot,null,null,null,"Agreed, but that why I saw we were contenders under Harry. We made it to the Quarter finals of the CL, managing to beat CL veterans and contenders AC Milan (who had Thiago Silva, Ibrahimovic, a still performing Inzaghi, former Bayern FC captn. van Bommel, an improving and promising Pato, and a hot star from the 2010 WC in the form of KP Boateng - I know, I know, he sucked with us). Regardless, we were punching above our weight and even qualified for the next CL of 2012 - 2013. But the 2011 - 2012 CL final saw Chelskie win a final no one believed they would win. And with that, so did Modric leave us (as well as VBV, who was a missing cog between midfield and the forwards until Eriksen came). After that, another season without CL, despite Bale's amazing and continued improvement, our next consistent star left us. We've been regressing a bit since Harry, but we are now part of the 7 teams who can challenge for the Top 4. Also, we have a much more balanced squad with a depth of class that made our CL qualifying team look paper thin (despite the first team probably having more talent over our first team).

As far as Levy and Berbatov, that's not how I remember it happening. Berbatov put on a hissy fit that would make Modric, and to a lesser extent, Bale seem like professional gentlemen of the highest caliber. Also, Berbatov left in 08, the same season we finished 8th (one spot below where we are likely to end up this season). So unless we're in the middle of a relegation fight at the moment, I don't think you remember that time too well.

Further more, we went on to finish 4th in the 09-08 campaign (our highest in the PL) so I really doubt Levy's tactics hurt us that much. At the very least, compared to Tim's tactics. Unless I've missed something, you've completely lost the mark one that one. When you look at the data of the past 20 years, you see that having Levy as chairman and ENIC as owners has benefited us amazingly. Unless we have another passionate potential owners that are willing to invest like ENIC, or better, I do not want to see a THFC with out Levy at the helm.

But I agree with you, that, at least if Dubai City come a knocking for Rose, they might get him. But an unknown is that if Rose will gamble on going to City... it's only been in the recent months that such a link is being made. You would have been laughed at last season, so even if City want him, will he take a gamble on going to a new club when his form hasn't been, even, Walker consistent? He seems to be playing well under Poch (since Poch), so I wonder how that will play in his decision making.

null,false,apple_kicks,null,null,null,"issue at the moment is finding places to build, lot of these council owned property is sold off to private rents because it makes more money and balances the councils budget faster. One of issue with some new builds is that they're building in brown sites areas no one else wants to because jobs, transport, schools etc are far away. If you're looking for social housing this can make matters worse on looking for work or getting opportunities so you can afford to buy your property or afford to leave the area. 

It looks like they're really just opening more chances for council to sell off property. 

&gt;The move would be funded by new rules forcing councils to sell properties ranked in the most expensive third of their type in the local area, once they become vacant. 
&gt;Home Secretary Theresa May said the plan would be made possible by local authorities ""managing their housing stock better"" and selling their most expensive properties, some of which were occupied by a single family.

So then people just rent off private landlords in better locations, however they'll rely more on housing benefits or Local Housing Allowance to afford it. Lot of landlords in ads refuse tenants on housing benefits so its harder to find places in your local council. If you do you might be asking council for more money to cover rent or a cut in council tax payments. This will be more expensive in the long run imo and benefit private landlords more.

As a player its his age and lack of play time which has caught up to him and I am sorry to say that we will never see the same wing play chemistry that him and Baines used to bring to the game for us. Their football together could win us games time after time and they looked so right together.

I wouldn't worry about a short term change in pub numbers, they will adjust to demand, and other types of drinking venues will take their place. e.g. [micropubs](http://micropubassociation.co.uk/) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micropub

It doesn't prove it wrong, things are not nearly as simple as you make out if only you could look beyond what's right in front of you.  So long as the government is committed to terminally rising house prices then where is the motivation to build?  Just sit on it and wait for it to rise yet further.  The government has made sitting on land with planning permission a wise investment in itself.  So yeah, try to think a bit more next time with regards to such things.

&gt;So? I'm sure all that income tax, corporation tax and VAT will go straight to the local authority, right? And I'm sure all the high paying 40%ers who get the housing association properties that seems to be in vogue down here will be paying more than their share.

Well one way or another they will get money.  If by no other means the people who live in these houses will pay their council tax.

&gt;Councils have the power to demand contributions to local infrastructure as a condition of permission. They should be using this more, not less.

This will discourage house building to an even greater extent so this is probably not a good idea.

Coffee is a bad idea. They - on average - have nothing that would resemble a coffee machine like in Germany, neither with filters, pads, or capsules. Usually, they have prepacked instant coffees there (Nescafe).
They do have an ALDI and LIDL in Hastings, so don't expect a ""Moser Roth"" brand chocolate to be exotic goods there - they basically have the same stuff as in Germany.

Now for the things you could take along:
Marzipan, Lebkuchen (even out of Christmas season, if you have access to it), Salami, Mozartkugeln,  German breads like Pumpernickel or a fresh and crispy Bauernbrot.

Don't expect beach parties in Hastings - the beach is pebbly, the water is cold, and alcohol is expensive... For beach try Camber (You might do this together with Rye). You can get a tidal information chart at the tourist information.

For food, try ""The Italian Way"" at the fountain down at the sea front. If you do the trip to Beachy Head, try the restaurant/inn near the visitor center. In Rye there is a very nice tea room just below the church, try either a cream tea or a sandwich there. Find a nice Fish&amp;Chips shop in the ""old town"", and definitely try the chips (and crips) with salt and vinegar (I was sceptical at first, too).

Traffic- and orientationwise, Hastings is a real nightmare. Always have a map with you and don't be afraid to ask. Apart from the sea front, roads go either up or down in Hastings. And be careful when crossing a road - this cannot be stressed enough.

null,false,MouMoneyMouProblem,null,null,null,"It's a tough one at the moment, like others have said the vague hope is that this season Mourinho was hellbent on winning the league so focussed solely on the first team and next season he might feel more comfortable playing youth players. I'm not sure how much I believe this as I personally think that Mourinho just values experience over potential and will always favour players he already trusts over giving a youth player a chance. 


There's also the argument that the youth players aren't quite ready to make the step up yet, the oldest of the current crop is only 20 with the youngest highly touted prospects still being 16, and the rest fitting in somewhere in between. This is where I think the next two seasons are going to be when we can start to properly judge Mourinho on if he is serious about utilising the youth players, if around the ages of 20-22 these players still can't get any playing time then I don't think they ever will. 


Finally I see a lot of people talk about how because Chelsea are going for titles they need world class youth players to break through which makes it harder. To an extent this is correct, obviously a player has more hope of being good enough for a midtable team than a Champions League team, but the counter to this in my opinion is Man United under Ferguson. John O'Shea, Wes Brown, Jonny Evans, Danny Welbeck, Tom Cleverley, Nicky Butt, Darren Fletcher, Darron Gibson, Phil Neville, Kieran Richardson etc. Every single one of those players has got a Premier League winners medal with Manchester United despite the fact that none of them are, or were, world class players. Some of them played hundreds of games for Manchester United, others were shipped out after a season or two, they played in big games, and they played in small games. No one is expecting Mourinho to drop half of the first team and play all of RLC, Solanke, Boga, Baker, Christensen, Brown or whoever, but in the coming seasons people want to see some of those players given a real chance to make their mark at Chelsea. They might not make it and get shipped off after a season or two, they might make a role for themselves as valuable squad players, or they might reach their potential and save Chelsea a £20m+ transfer fee on a similar player. If none of them are given a chance though then at best they'll be a footnote and sold off for a couple of million each, and if they reach their potential elsewhere we could have another Matic on our hands.

One person I know became legal guardian for her younger sister who was around 13 at the time, then used that fact to get a council house. They're now earning 30k+, the sister has long moved out by herself, but the person still has the house and its super cheap rent.

A second person I know, their partner's mum had a 3 bed council house their whole life. My friend and partner both work and earn good money, then the mum give up her house in exchange for the partner getting a 2 bed place. Now a young working couple with no children have a 2 bed place in a very trendy part of London, paying less than half market rate. And guess what, they'll have it forever too.

If social housing is to exist, it needs to be more dynamic. The whole  idea of a council house being a home for life leads to totally broken situations. And hey, would you give up an affordable place in London if you happened to get one?

null,false,vzzzbux,eng-Cornwall,Cornwall,null,"&gt; So long as the government is committed to terminally rising house prices then where is the motivation to build? Just sit on it and wait for it to rise yet further. The government has made sitting on land with planning permission a wise investment in itself. So yeah, try to think a bit more next time with regards to such things.

So yes, I'm proven correct - it's not planning permission, it's the refusal of the private sector to do anything that stops prices from lowering. Glad you see you can admit that.

&gt; Well one way or another they will get money. If by no other means the people who live in these houses will pay their council tax.

Many of the houses that are built are affordable houses (which removes most of what little regulations there are) - I wonder how many of the occupants are paying full council taxes and aren't getting full or partial exemptions.

&gt; This will discourage house building to an even greater extent so this is probably not a good idea. 

Which is when you start acting on land banks - build on it or lose it. We shouldn't be pleading with the private sector to build houses by removing what few regulations exist and letting them do anything they want.

&gt; You're from Cornwall and you're advocating even more stringent planning permission. Nimby as fuck mate. 

When the HA built houses directly across the road from me, I sent in precisely zero objections to the plans. I'm really NIMBY, aren't I. I do now have to keep the blinds closed to stop the new residents looking into the bedrooms or living room though. I do believe that a few councillors or planning officers have got a few brown envelopes from the farmer who owned the land, because a previous attempt at permission was refused, a few irrelevant changes made, and suddenly it was no problem.

When actually looking at the approval for that development, what few conditions the council placed on it (like an education levy) basically don't apply because it doesn't apply to affordable housing. What a crock of shit. I'm sure quite a lot of my council tax is paying for all the taxis to ferry their children to other primary schools as the nearest one is full.

People who own houses, for example, will enjoy the benefits of their home, their investment, gaining value.

There are many different ways people will win and lose, but the important thing is it creates two groups, winners and losers; outsiders and insiders. In short, it benefits homeowners and landlords (insiders) to block the building of new homes to protect their investment - anticompetitive practice - to keep prices high. Since the insiders are explicitly the ones with the money it is easier for them to organise themselves - thus the market gets rigged in favour of the insiders.

&gt;Some states already deploy defence systems – such as Israel’s Iron Dome and the US Phalanx and C-Ram – that are programmed to respond automatically to threats from incoming munitions.

Phalanx and C-RAM are automated systems that track incoming rockets, artillery or mortars and destroys them before they reach their target. They have to be automated because humans don't have the required reflexes to calculate the trajectory, track and then engage these targets.

If these were banned then sailors and soldiers would be sitting in their base / ship, watching missiles heading towards them and going ""Welp, this is going to hurt"" because there would be nothing they could do about it.

I guess then you could say that only offensive automated weapons systems should not be allowed but then...

&gt;Work is also progressing on what is known as “automatic target recognition”.

ATR is a bit of a misnomer. It implies that you fire the weapon in a random direction and then it uses AI to find a suitable target. This is not the case. You would upload target data (e.g. the IR signature or outline of a ship) to the weapon control system. When the missile reaches the general area of the target, it can use this information to pick out the desired target amongst clutter (e.g. an enemy warship in the midst of civilian vessels) to ensure you don't hit the wrong thing.

This will actually lessen the incidence of civilian casualties, not increase it. Why should we have a kneejerk ban on technology which could do this?

* Even if I don't wear makeup, I wear mascara (sparse invisible Asian lashes here) and even though oil melts it off my lashes, I hate having black streaks/smears all over my face and they're hard to wash off the washcloth, hence the micellar water prior to oil cleansing.
* I used to be content with just oil cleansing as it doesn't dry out my face, but I found out that my SD-prone skin didn't quite like it. So, if I want to avoid having flaky face, I still need to suds.

If I can, I'd love to have simpler cleansing routine. :(",null,0,null,1429005017,null,0,false,0,cqbtl79,null,t3_32jdor,null,t1_cqbtl79,null,t1_cqbspln,null,null,null,1432381570,null,2,false,SkincareAddictionUK,t5_32evd,2,null

In theory, yes, I get how markets work. But land and real property have always been unique markets from any other product. And they operate under different conditions.

You say that they could make more money by selling a greater number of less profitable properties, and on paper that's true, but there are a number of reasons, common to all development firms, why that would be a disadvantageous solution

1: It would require greater capital investment at the outset. Increased building means increased materials and labour. Its simple.

2: That increase would need to be funded, likely by loans, those loans would be considered higher risk due to the reduced (and ever reducing if they solve the supply crisis) rate of return. And therefore cost more. 


3: The current prices are only held up by stagnation of supply, once supply meets demand, prices collapse. Which means that their existing stock crumbles to a fraction of its value. Both in terms of unsold houses and in terms of the speculative value of the land they hold on which to build.

Then comes Arsenal, its quite closer than I imagined when I did the possible outcomes. The simple solution is to win our next 3 with Utd, Arsenal and Leicester City. Now that's the optimist in me and it doesn't have the DRAMA that EPL ensures us. So my ideal situation to maximize the DRAMA would be that we beat UTD and Arsenal, lose the rest of the way....(Liverpool's False hope of Top 4 is in there) and on the final day we beat Sunderland at home.... relegating them (they are the only team this season to collect a clean sheet against us), after their lose at the Emirates. This also seems unreal as Mou wouldn't lose that many games in a row and specifically to Liverpool at the Bridge.
So that leaves us with drawing against UTD and Arsenal (both likely with the respective forms) and managing 2 wins and 2 draws from the remaining 5 fixtures. So 2 wins, 4 draws and 1 lose (Never underestimate the Pardiola effect) from the remaining 7 matches. That's as realistic as it can get.

Friedman advocated negative income tax, which is not the basic income as you describe it due to the tapering in the credit. I know saying Friedman supported UBI is a popular thing to do to make it seem bi-partisan but it is slightly duplicitous. 

I'm also unclear how UBI alone would solve inequality.

I think UBI advocates need to do back-of-the-envelope maths like this to ensure that this is *really* what they want

The basic state pension is just about to change, and rise to £148.40 per week, or £7716.80 per year. Let's take that as a baseline for what you mean when you say, ""Basic income would pay ideally the same as a pension""

There's 64.1m people in the UK, which gives us a Basic Income liability of about £495bn - that is to say we need to find £495bn per year for the scheme to work, because otherwise we don't really have a 'basic income', but rather we're paying ourselves our part of our children's salary.

Looking at ukpublicspending.co.uk (which I know sometimes has odd ways of breaking down the figures, but this is just an back-of-the-envelope calculation...) we see that total UK government spending in 2014 was £714bn, of which £143bn was pensions (which we can remove straight away, since pensioners are now being paid their pensions out of the 'basic income' pot rather than the 'pension' pot). I guess we can also strip out the £112bn we spend on welfare, since BI proponents believe BI replaces welfare (although BI proposes giving those currently on welfare *less* money than they get under the current system, which I find a little unpalateble). 

This leaves us about £240bn short (about £200bn if you agree with the Greens we can do without a standing army). 

The top 10% of earners in the UK pay [55.4%](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/306818/Income_Tax_Liabilities_Statistics_-_April_2014.pdf) of all the tax, or £395.5bn according to those earlier figures (you are in the top 10% if you earn more than about £50,000 before tax). Very approximately, you could finance a Basic Income if you charged this group a marginal rate of 65% rather than the 40% they currently pay (the Greens are talking about a 60% rate because they don't need to find the money to fund a standing army).

So I think this is probably affordable, but I find the distributive implications difficult to swallow; a 65% tax rate is pretty high considering we're using this punative rate to subsidise people earning £40,000 / year, and we can only afford it by cutting the payments we currently give to the worst off. I'd be much happier with a minimum income guarentee or a negative income tax which avoids these problems.",null,0,null,1429006417,null,0,false,0,cqbtvuh,null,t3_32jldy,null,t1_cqbtvuh,null,t3_32jldy,null,null,null,1432381710,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

null,false,MouMoneyMouProblem,null,null,null,"Well, I'd say one reason would be that if you can save the money on a squad player by using a player from the academy that frees up money that can be spent on another position. Equally having homegrown players allows for a naturally bigger squad, and though I know Mourinho doesn't like a huge squad I'm sure the current lack of homegrown options must be a little bit bothersome to him. There's also the fact that sometimes you never really know how a player is going to grow and adapt once given first team football, some players flourish, others get distracted and fade away, if (for instance) Loftus-Cheek ended up becoming the powerhouse central midfielder many hope he will become that saves Chelsea at least £30m (Schneiderlin money) if not more (think Pogba). Finally there's the intangible effect having players that have grown up with the club being in the squad can have, there's a naturally bigger connection with the fans, arguably more desire to perform well, I think it can only have a positive impact on the dressing room atmosphere. Would John Terry be quite the leader he has been for Chelsea if he hadn't come up through the youth? Maybe yes, maybe no. 


Perhaps selfishly from a fan point of view there's also a certain pride that comes from having academy players make it through to the first team, as much as I love the likes of Lampard, Drogba, Cech etc they just fall short of how I feel about John Terry, and with him nearing the end of his career personally I would like to have that sort of connection with some players in the squad.

Planning permission is the original cause...  embarrassing that you can't wrap your head around such a simple notion.

&gt;Many of the houses that are built are affordable houses (which removes most of what little regulations there are) - I wonder how many of the occupants are paying full council taxes and aren't getting full or partial exemptions.

If you honestly think that the housing market is under regulated, especially that planning permission is too relaxed, then I don't know what to say to you really.  You're living in an alternate universe and some quantum fuckerie has allowed you to communicate with ours.  That must be it.

Buying and renting aren't interchangeable like that.

Anyone with an income can rent (whether its flat share or their own flat is another matter), but a mortgage requires saving for a deposit. That deposit is much bigger given house prices have risen so greatly, and the possibility of saving it is much reduced given you need to rent whilst you save (unless you can live at home or get on social housing).

Living at home is entirely dependent on getting a job commutable from your family home, which is increasingly difficult since investment across the country is disproportionate.

Social housing is firstly there is an umbrella, so getting it isn't easy. And unless the Government replaces houses on a one-to-one scale, social housing will become much more scarce.

Also If you have an expensive home you are more vulnerable to income shocks, since the cost of running a large home is higher. If you have financial difficulties and an expensive home you can downsize and save money, while if you own an inexpensive home you can't, and renting is likely to be more expensive. So the owner of a cheaper home has more of an incentive to hold on to it.

I'm only calling for things to be examined in a wider context and for people to understand that Russia is being portrayed in a distinctly negative light right now. For good reason? I wouldn't cast judgement on that, it's not my place.

What I can do though is remind anyone reading that there is a wider narrative going on right now due to the tensions between NATO and the Russian military over Ukraine.

I think when people have security and know they aren't going to starve, when they know that even if the worst happens they will have help to get them back on their feet then there is no problem with business.

Sturridge has been consistently unreliable this year. If it was just the one large injury, fair enough - but it's become more than that. 

Borini, bless him, has the heart but not the ability, yet at least. He was primed to be an excellent player. He backs himself and I respect that. There was a chance for him to shoot last night against Newcastle, but he opted to attempt to pass through two players to pass to Coutinho who was running with him. We need a player who is going to say - ""I got this - I score goals"". He isn't that. 

Balotelli, I love the guy, and he seems to have genuinely improved his game. Unfortunately he hasn't improved it to make him better than any other player, simply so he isn't as far below as some of our other players. In terms of pressing and team play. I think he is a great person to have on the field - and out of him and Borini I'd opt to keep him. Balotelli would thrive most from having a poacher/natural goal scorer next to him. He does tricks and passes which make me think he's got to be cheating sometimes. 

Lambert and Aspas - Lambert is good cover, and I think should be played a bit more - I don't think he would miss a few of the opportunities that fell to Sterling last night. 

With regards to Aspas I don't even know anymore. I didn't hear much about him before he came here and he didn't impress. 

We have all of these players, but no one who is able to score goals consistently, whether that be through injury or not being on the level of the players around them. 
That makes it a bit of a sorry list. Only one tried and tested player for our level is (as Balotelli seems to have dropped a few pegs as of late) not enough.

For example Chris asked Phil Collinson to do something about KB and was disappointed in PC's response or rather lack of response. b) Series 1 filming was a trainwreck, it was far more ambitious than anything they'd done before and they were badly out of their depth and massively behind schedule. There was one night where Billie and Chris had to travel from Cardiff to London for a night shoot but didn't actually get to shoot anything because they were so far behind, the production didn't get to their scenes. Chris' father was also very ill during filming, and Chris' stress-related medical condition was badly flaring up. There are rumours he had problems with some of the writing, like the farting aliens. However he only signed on for one series (with the option of renewing his contract) so it's possible he was never intending to stay very long. He's also said that he had issues with the top brass and that his face didn't fit.

I do not think that he has any animosity towards the show. He talks warmly about DW, was willing to be in the 50th anniversary (only dropped out due to scheduling problems and the script not being ready for him to read), and is amazing with DW fans.

I understand the difference in degree and the practicalities of the matter (ie, you can do something about an unfairness that stems from ""too much money"", but not much about one that stems from ""effed up beliefs"" without creating some form of thoughtcrime), but it really rubs me off the wrong way to have a tax designed to make people less well off because that is somehow unfair to people that had less successful parents, even more so when there's no actual connection between the use of monies acquired via such a tax and improvements in the condition/status of the less well off.

null,false,justNickoli,null,null,null,"&gt;The main reason I will be voting Conservative is because I believe that the economic plan they have put out is viable, working and will ensure that by the time I graduate in 2018 there will be jobs that I actually want to do as a career out there.

""The economy"", measured by GDP, is not that helpful in measuring job availability. The Conservatives' plan *might* increase the GDP figure, but I don't believe it will help people looking for jobs. 

&gt; help us to spend more on the NHS (which the government did for every year of this last parliament and have pledged to do again for the next parliament), 

Not convinced I believe this. Is it in real terms, and excluding the costs of the top-down reorganisation they promised wouldn't happen? 

&gt;it will keep us more secure from the extremely un-predictable economic situation of the EU 

Promising a referendum could make this worse - less predictably. 

&gt;and that one day I might be able to buy one of the 200,000+ homes they've pledged to build by 2020 or be one of the 1.3 million tenants who have used help to buy.

Labour have also pledged to build more. This is the only way to solve the housing shortage (making second homes more expensive or difficult to buy may help a little, but not enough to build a policy around). Help to buy and similar schemes help the relatively small number of people who use them, especially those who use them early on, but the overall effect on the market is to push prices up and make it more difficult for most people. 

&gt;In my opinion the Labour plan is outdated, relying too heavily on borrowing and would cripple the economic growth that has seen us become the fastest growing economy in the EU. I believe that Labour is also endangering the NHS by having a weak economy. 

I am not convinced Labour have the best plan for the NHS, but it don't believe it's worse than selling bits off and using lowest-bidder for-profit companies to provide more and more of it. 

&gt;Lastly, I support an EU referendum. I would vote to stay in the EU and I think it would be a strong success in my favour and that would shut up 1 particular party. Regardless, I think we should also go ahead with it because nobody in this country that was born after the 5th of June 1957 has been consulted in a national referendum on our membership and I don't think that is right or democratic.

The referendum promise could well damage the economy. Is that worth it? Maybe, but with the focus on making that GDP figure higher it seems odd to have such a prominent policy that will work against it. My position on this is closest to the Green's - EU has major problems that need looking at, but also massive potential benefit.

I typed this on mobile so it's a bit difficult to proof read and edit such a big piece, I hope it's readable.

I'm voting Conservative. Several reasons. Under a Labour government we would likely return to a bloated public sector, with too many levels of management and not enough front line staff. They also tie in closely with unions, which I disagree with. I don't feel that staff should be able to hold the public hostage just because some staff are unhappy.

Lib Dems I do side with, but they are against expansion at major airports and infrastructure projects which I feel would hold the country back.

Under the Conservatives I've personally never been better off. I know some have been struggling, and of course I empathize for those less well off, but for my family, tax is down, salaries are up, and we have around £15k a year more in our pockets than we did 5 tears ago (we also didn't have 2 children 5 years ago). That isn't necessarily down to a Tory government, could just be how things go over time, but it's all I can judge it on.

I feel that we need a referendum on Europe, to prove that we should be in it. I'm massively pro-EU and feel that a referendum would be the only way to get a fair vote.

I feel that the Conservatives are the only party that would start giving England the chance to have our own powers. 

My vote will be in vain. I live in one of the safest seats Labour have. But knowing I've voted for the party that I believe the most in is one of the greatest privileges we have.

null,false,HolySheesh,null,null,null,"1) Absolutely correct, but there is still positive correlation between the growth of the economy and the growth in jobs. Maybe a 5% GDP growth doesn't necessarily result in a 5% job growth rate but I believe a stronger economy will lead to more jobs. More money in the economy, more investments, more businesses opening up would logically lead to more jobs.

2) I must confess I'm not entirely sure about the top down re-organisation issue you have mentioned, I will need to educate myself further, [but the Tories have pledged to spend £8 billion a year extra for the NHS. That was the point I was trying to make.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-32260220)

3) I understand what you mean but I don't think that a referendum in this country would lead to an economic situation in Europe that would cause too much of an issue. What I meant about the unpredictability of Europe and being secure is that if we can have a strong (and relatively independent) economy then when/if the sick man of Europe returns we will be in a stronger position to firstly not be brought down with them, and also to be able to offer assistance. But I do understand your point and I'll need to think it through some more.

4) I'm not sure if you're correct, maybe you have a different source but the Conservatives have pledged to build 200,000 by 2020 and [the Labour party's own website says they pledge the same.](http://www.labour.org.uk/issues/detail/house-building) I would like some clarification on what you've said as it is a very important issue that I'd like to know as much as possible about.

5) I don't think we should sell bits off either, but I think we need to pledge more money to the NHS and we need to steamline our services so that we're not wasting what we give the NHS. I don't agree with all of the aspects of the Tory plan but I think that if we want to at the very least continue with the service we have now, and not have it decline, then the Labour plan will put the NHS at risk more than the Conservative. IMO we need a strong economy to pay for an excellent NHS, and if we are not growing and earning as much as we could then all we are doing is limiting the NHS's potential. This is just my opinion and I'd like to know what you think as well.

6) Re. the EU I am very much in favour, I love the aspect of free movement throughout and I think that our relations are good. There are certain aspects I'm not a fan of. I would never want to see us join the single currency and even though the Daily Mail and UKIP play this aspect us, I am also not a fan of EU governmental intervention here in the U.K. However I think that it is only fair and democratic for the people to say what they want on the issue, we have this system supposedly to give people a voice in how this country is run so why not let them voice their concerns?

When the particles are small enough, they get into the digestive systems of bottom feeders, filter fish and plankton. It's the same process by which non-biodegradable plastics break down into much smaller particles and get into the first levels of the food chain. Just recently dolphin and whale meat in Japan was tested for heavy metals (something which resides in tyres in great amounts) and they saw levels 48 times that of normal. These heavy metals continue up the food chain and are disastrous for the oceans ecosystems.

It's more than likely one of the main reasons for the acidification of the ocean and is an utterly terrifying prospect for our future. When plankton goes, so does everything else.

**Main/first answer** Possible that the age demographics reduce their numbers on places like this, or at your job? Also, tory voters tend to be people who come from, are, or expect to be a well off household, if your job is full of people from working class backgrounds who don't really think theres a chance they're going to be in the top tax bracket then they'll be less likely to be tory. 

I have a few tory mates who don't mention it much either because a lot of people are VERY angry with the tories, and verbally so. You might not vote tory because you want to slash public services, (maybe you just really hate people being allowed to watch porn in their own homes?), but if you mention you vote tory, then THAT is what will be aimed at you, and seriously who wants that?

Personally, I'm almost certainly not voting for them, but I don't think they're evil, and I don't think their voters are either. I just think they're unfair, and I think a lot of the reason people go along with a party that unquestionably benefits the rich few at the cost of the majority is that a lot of people genuinely believe that something will happen that will make them rich one day.",null,0,null,1429010864,null,0,1429011119,0,cqbuxxj,null,t3_32inaa,null,t1_cqbuxxj,null,t3_32inaa,null,null,null,1432382209,null,7,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,7,null

The result is Governments will be forced into either forcing companies to employ people to do nothing, or into simply taxing companies and creating some sort of Basic Income that people will rely on as their source of income.

Most work after this happens will be unpaid and voluntary, like charity work or artistic pursuits.

I think it's too early for it at the moment, most work isn't automated. Heavily taxing companies to provide revenue for Basic Income will only serve to hamper the economy and job creation. At the moment we're still reliant on ""Labour = Pay"" because we're still largely reliant on humans producing that labour, not machines. 

Saddle companies with having to pay humans *and* high taxes to fund Basic Income and you're harming the economy. One must replace the other, not exist in parallel.

I'd rather we continue the way we're currently working for now, because the current system is at least conducive to competition, and competition breeds innovation, which moves us towards automation and the end of human labour as the primary means of wealth creation.

The idea in the most basic form is really just re-assignment of wages. Currently companies pay people and that's how they get their money, while in the ""world of tomorrow"" the money that should've went on payroll costs will become taxation and then people get the money anyway.

The rich still stay rich because replacing humans with machinery (at the point of it being advanced enough to be a replacement) cuts out many other areas of lost revenue like holiday pay, sick leave, human error and human inefficiency; innovation still trundles along (be it automated or these companies paying small numbers of highly educated specialists for R&amp;D); and the job market doesn't matter any more.

FOAF spent a few hours at the British Library reading journals and reports on different forms of xray and ultrasound imaging of drug mules, he found evidence of amounts that can be concealed without detection depending on behaviour of the person being scanned.  These amounts were far in excess of one gram, which not being greedy was more than enough for the NYE night.

The conspiracy theory about him learning that he was fired when the BBC announced David Tennant's casting comes entirely from a series of posts by a Filipino blogger who runs a Chris Eccleston fansite. She claimed that a top BBC executive working on Doctor Who had come across her posts on a fanforum and been so impressed by her intelligence that he'd messaged her and subsequently told her all the top secret stuff that had happened behind the scenes. Conveniently what this exec told her fitted exactly with her own beliefs. She despises David Tennant with a passion, the exec says David Tennant was a lying backstabber. She went from liking Euros Lynn to hating him when the Comic Con video of him saying he preferred David's Doctor to Chris was released, and viola, the mystery exec reveals that the bullying director was actually Euros, when dozens of people have been saying for years that it was Boak.

The only way her post could be true is if David Tennant, RTD, and Chris Eccleston himself are all pathological liars who have kept up a conspiracy for more than a decade.

There is basically no chance that the UK would face a nuclear threat that France wouldn't and the same the other way around. It would essentially cut the cost of the deterrent in half whilst maintaining a continuous at-sea second strike capability for both nations.

There would be no chance that the permanent member status of both nations on the UN security council would be jeopardised either, what with both nations remaining nuclear powers.

Other benefits of an anglo-french deal would be the cutting of ties with the US with regards to nuclear defence.

Second, with Sahko out it becomes a pairing of Skrtel and Can/Lovren which scares me terribly.  We were lucky to have an early lead and didn't have to push the fullbacks up for width.  LFC were able to sit back, absorb pressure and counter attack which they did.  

Third is the issue of right back.  With the delightful choice of Glen Johnson, Manquillo or maybe Flanagan to play there it is, aside from striker, our worst position at the moment.  The remaining schedule is forgiving but to think that opposing teams won't tear this defense to shreds if given a chance to run at them is absurd.  

Fourth, three attackers sounds good but it looks like it will be a false nine scenario.  I don't like the idea of no designated striker, it can lead to a lot of pointless possession.  They won't be playing against Janmaat and Mike Williamson each week.  

Against a competent defense that is really organized it can be frustrated which will pull in the fullbacks and midfielders, that will expose the CB's on the counter, which is how they should play LFC.  

I think the 4-3-3 could work but I am not confident in the team at this point.

What got me through Mod1/Mod2 was I found I needed to eat properly. I found that if I don't eat properly I get anxious, panicky and my concentration takes a dive. Pretty much what you might expect really. So I took two bananas and an orange with me to both tests. Both are ""known"" treatments for exam anxiety. I forced myself to eat the first banana just before I got on the bike at the training school and the second banana and the orange when I was waiting for my test to start. That distracted me when I was in the waiting room. Was so hard to eat them, but once I had I had the energy and the focus to fly through both modules. What's more is my three failed driving tests, I didn't eat at all on the day before the test due to nerves. So I ate something this time. Seemed to work.

&gt;I don't think it is ever a good idea to start censoring people 

If quality control strikes you as ""censorship"", then I invite you to read the rules again. This was set up, explicitly, as a *heavily moderated* community. 

&gt;I think that some people will be worried their comment will be deleted or labelled 'low effort' and simply decided not to post.

This is one reason we've held off on a measure like this for this long - the problem is that our reluctance to moderate has led to a marked dip in quality. 

We think the community's at a size that can tolerate a rule like this now. I'm not overly worried. Though, if it does end up damaging the sub, we'll happily revert it. 

&gt;* 'low effort' is far too subjective a criteria to moderate comments on. Moderation should always strive to be transparent imo.

We're talking about stepping in and stopping people responding to any thread concerning UKIP and the Conservatives with single-line variations on ""etonian berks"", to the end of making this a more pleasant place to actually discuss things. 

The rule is fairly explicit, and the way it'll be implemented is obvious. We're here to *discuss as a community*- not simply to be a side-annex of the Guardian's article comments section. We're not going to be draconian about this rule- if something does add something of substantive worth to the discussion (or, for that matter, is funny enough to add something in itself), it'll stay up- otherwise, it can just as well be stated at lower levels, or rephrased in such a way that it *does* add something. 

The community coped fine taking pains to put effort into debates four months ago, and it can manage it just fine now. We'll all get far more out of it than we're currently getting.

&gt;* Reddit is not a forum. The comment system is more akin to irc than a traditional forum making large text blocks ugly and difficult to read. Reddit simply isn't suited to anything other informal, conversational discourse.

Strictly a matter of opinion- and, for that matter, one I disagree with strongly. There are ample subreddits centred around discussion- for example, while we're not planning on going to anything quite like that extreme in heavy moderation, /r/AskHistorians is a wonderful spot. Reddit is a wonderful platform for community building and discussion - I'd say it's substantially better than old-style flat forums, at that. Threaded comments and an open network of communities create a great environment for this sort of thing, provided subreddits are well run. 

This has always been, and continues to be, a venue for moderated political discussion. That you happen to dislike the platform has no bearing upon that fact- it's very much a minority opinion. 

&gt;* Deleting comments will only lead to bad feelings and it only takes one injustice (real or perceived) to unleash a epic shitstorm of r/drama 

We're not here to tiptoe around fragile egos upset they can't clutter up the top comment level with contributions that add nothing. If they can't make their point any other way, they're welcome to not make it at all.

You seem to be objecting to the notion of anyone actually moderating a forum. We've been entirely upfront about the aims of this place since the start- quality control matters.

&gt;I disagree, I've been on reddit for (god help me) about 7 years now, and subreddits usually turn into shit holes somewhere in between 30,000 and 50,000 users. At that point the original userbase, which holds to a certain set of values, becomes too diluted to enforce those values against lowest common denominator crap like advice animals and rage comics. Resulting in a rapid race to the bottom for easy karma. /r/fitness was great example of this. 

&gt;edit: see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September

Having also been on reddit for pushing eight years across several accounts, this isn't the case. It's very much contingent upon the community, size, nature and activity of the subreddit in question- /r/BritishPolitics maintained a fairly pleasant, constructive community up until we hit ~1,500 subscribers, at which point a number of unexpected influxes of new members triggered a decisive shift in tone. We've already had a number of long-time members up sticks and leave as a result of the decline in quality- as far as we're concerned, we don't want this community to become a place that's unpleasant to visit for *anybody*. 

...I feel obliged to point out that the only individual to have posted advice animals in this subreddit for some time has been you, as well.  

&gt;* [last but not least](http://cdn.meme.am/instances/500x/48976481.jpg)

No. 

What creates a circlejerk is a subreddit community's ceasing to be simply *slanted* towards the left, and stretching towards becoming *actively hostile* towards anybody from the right who comes here to join in. Mob-like low-effort comments are the tip of the iceberg- we're looking at what else we can do to deal with things. 

What attracted people to this place originally was the absence of bigotry, and generally *higher standard of discussion* than the other place. The latter is dropping away a bit- and we're rather keen to prevent that.

null,false,Kitchner,null,null,null,"&gt;Inflation in the UK has actually fallen from approx 3% to 0% in the last government.

This isn't neccessarily a good thing. One of the drivers behind inflation is the public spending cash. The more people spend cash, the higher the inflation is. This is why fast growing economies (e.g. China) have relatively high inflation, because people are finding themselves with more cash, and they spend it.

An accusation leveled at the Tory economic program for the last 5 years has been that while economic growth has been achieved, it's ""false"" in the way that the vast majority of people have a lot less money. People aren't spending as much *despite* the fact that interest rates are at an all time low (which in theory should be encouraging spending). So when you see companies growing and the public spending a little extra cash, remember we literally couldn't be doing any more to encourage that.

Low inflation is actually an indicator that the average Briton isn't spending much money, because they don't have much cash to spare.

&gt;The government is not directly responsible for controlling inflation. Inflation is controlled by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC of The Bank of England. The set an interest rate they believe will control the rate of inflation (to keep it in-line with the government's target of 2%).

While you're partly right, there are tons of government policies that effect inflation. For example, if you decided to give everyone a £1000 a year tax cut, people will spend more which will push inflation upwards.

&gt;I'm sorry to hear about the problems with your currently employment situation. I'm not sure what industry you work in but obviously your employer is not doing very well at the moment and therefore is feeling pessimistic with regards to delivering salary increases and is making redundancies. Perhaps there are other factors here to blame (EU policy, fall in demand for certain goods, immigration).

You definitely should never make assumptions like this. You have no idea what he does, what his company is like or anything. There are a ton of reasons why companies make redundancies or stall pay rises, and a lot of them aren't just the company isn't doing well.

Can I ask you which industry you work in? Because it's  pretty standard not to get pay rises, and companies performing well do often make redundancies. I'm interested in seeing how much experience you have dealing with companies like that.

The idea that redundancies and pay cuts are **only** the result of the employer doing poorly or being pessimistic (which if they were btw would be as a result of current economic performance) is pretty hard core right wing ideology.

If 2 comments into a discussion you have to start being a dickhead all you do is belittle your argument...

&gt;You think it's ""fair"" or ""right"" that people that happen to be children of the wealthy get to live in nice houses for free, while people that happen to be children of the poor get nothing?

No, I don't think that's fair but I also don't think that this issue is that 1 dimensional. Taking London as the prime example, in 1995 the median price for a terraced house [(£82,850)](http://www.home.co.uk/guides/house_prices_report.htm?location=london&amp;all=1) would place it £72,000 below the [then inheritance tax threshold](http://www.home.co.uk/guides/house_prices_report.htm?location=london&amp;all=1). Now the median price for a terraced house in London places it £130,000 above it. So for the same (average terraced - aside from their property value these families are not necessarily rich) house the property bubble we're experiencing means that children could be forced to leave their homes to pay IHT.


Once again, I'm not suggesting we scrap the tax or increase the threshold. I'm just suggesting it should be levied once a home is sold or rented. Property is a home, not an investment.

There is, but putting the focus on GDP (and deficit) isn't the most effective way of increasing jobs. It's not worth doing if makes inequality greater.

&gt;2) I must confess I'm not entirely sure about the top down re-organisation issue you have mentioned

The Health and Social Care Act 2012 was the biggest part of this.

[Wikipedia's entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_and_Social_Care_Act_2012) says ""It provides for the most extensive reorganisation of the structure of the National Health Service in England to date."" ([source - BMJ](http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.d408.full))

It abolished NHS primary care trusts and Strategic Health Authorities; transferred between £60 billion and £80 billion of ""commissioning"", or health care funds, from PCTs to several hundred ""clinical commissioning groups"", partly run by the general practitioners (GPs) in England and a major point of access for private service providers. It's putting more administrative work on GPs, and massively increasing the scope for private companies to provide services. (Partly paraphrased from wikipedia entry)

&gt;3) I don't think that a referendum in this country would lead to an economic situation in Europe 

I think it would have a bigger impact on the UK than the rest of europe. I'm not convinced that we *shouldn't* have a referendum, just that it's not the big issue that the Conservatives (and UKIP) have been pushing it as.  

&gt;4) I'm not sure if you're correct, maybe you have a different source but the Conservatives have pledged to build 200,000 and [Labour the same]

My wording could have been clearer - I mean Labour have promised to build more, as well as the Tories, not more *than* the Tories. Schemes to help people buy have the effect of pushing up prices. If some-one has a £10k deposit (a huge amount of money for most people), 90% mortgages gets them up to £100k house. With a scheme to let them have a 5% deposit, there are now more people in the market for houses up to £200k.

&gt;5) I don't think we should sell bits off either, but I think we need to pledge more money to the NHS

Labour don't give a hard figure in their [manifesto](http://www.labour.org.uk/manifesto/nhs), but do pledge ""Labour will invest in 20,000 more nurses, 8,000 more GPs, and 3,000 more midwives"". More of it being moved into the private sector has been one of the effects of the Health and Social Care Act.

&gt;6) Re. the EU I am very much in favour, I love the aspect of free movement throughout and I think that our relations are good.

I think for the most part I agree with you on europe, but I think we should have a push to make the EU more accountable and more democratic first, and that so far everyone who has promised this has actually just fought for exemptions and vetoes, instead of reforming the Council of Europe and giving more visibility to the work of MEPs.

They are so illiterate here.  Anyone can create money.  *This payment takes 3 days to fully clear, but I want that item now, I'm trust worthy, you know where I live, can I have it please*.  I've just 'created' money.  All companies do the same, this is why it's a crime to trade whilst insolvent.  I'll order something, but not pay till the end of the month, it makes managing cash flow easier.  The problem is as a well, they use the word private banks.  Do they mean what the financial world calls private banks (ie un-incorporated), or are they meaning anything that isn't a glorious state managed bank?

There's nothing really wrong with it. You support City in your own way, and that's great. Just don't equate your support of the club with the core, longstanding and local supporters. That's what really gets people's backs up, and really earns new fans abroad a lot of ire.

So instead they pay a 3rd party warehouse to hold, receive and ship their stock. When there are no orders for one customer, they ship orders for other customers. One warehouse now covering maybe 20-30 companies.

Or customer service, loads of companies outsource their customer service. Lets say they know they always get peaks at Christmas, they don't want to have to hire the staff to cover it. They pay a company to do it for them and just pay a premium at Christmas, way cheaper than hiring.

That is what I am not sure about. If they don't, then you are paying 100 for an asset that is worth 80 and your net worth has come down by the 20. In such a scenario one would be better-off renting, as you are richer by 20.

Except that we most certainly are not. We rank 10th by deaths per capita and 8th by deaths per driver.

&gt;Where do you draw the line at worse/comparable/better? By what you've said, we're 'comparable' to Germany, but worse than Norway, despite the gap between Germany and us being greater than the gap between us and Norway.

I actually didn't include Germany in the list of countries comparable when you look at the statistics, because they don't outperform us in any of the metrics I found. 

I think there are 3 countries that are objectively better than us in road safety and that is Norway, The Netherlands and Sweden. The countries that I called comparable outperformed us in one metric, but we outperformed them in another. I think that's fair.

If you want to look at how close countries like Germany are then it makes our safety record look even less spectacular and less worthy of boasting about. 

I think we agree but we're in danger of just arguing about sematics so I'll state my point more concisely:

* The UK does not have the safest roads in the world, although they are safe.

* The UK's road safety record is not head and shoulders better than comparable countries.

Now I must confess that I am much more interested in driverless cars. I think you're right that adoption will be slow, but they do [have government backing and are currently being tested in major British cities](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/11/driverless-cars-roll-out-trials-uk-roads). I think driverless cars will take off once insurance companies realise they are much safer than manual cars, and insurance prices adjust accordingly. experts seem pretty confident that we will start to see driverless cars in years rather than decades, Nissan are claiming that they will have a model in production by 2020.

I don't think cyclists are safe or sensible on the roads or the pavement unless they have specific lanes. I think we still trail behind many parts of Europe in that regard. I'm not sure if cycle lanes are the best solution or whether something more ambitious is the answer, such as London's cycle superhighway plan.

I suffer from hormonal acne mainly on the jawline and forehead, currently being brought under control by contraceptive pill, and also on adapalene from the GP.
I'm also battling some wide open pores and blackheads.

So my routine goes like this:
Morning: 
wash face with **Clarins cottonseed foaming cleanser** - I know this isnt the best, but I have to get through it before I can buy anything else. 
Then I use the **Stridex Red pads** (SCA) which I ordered from the states (these made an almost immediate difference to the texture of my skin and helped me get rid of some lumps and bumps).  
I follow this with **Simple Clear Skin Oil Balancing Moisturiser**, 
and finish up with a **Neutrogena factor 55** sunscreen.
Mostly having success here I think, but very occasionally the sunscreen will sting my skin like mad... not sure why? keen to find something more gentle? (and maybe a physical one?) - needs to be relatively high factor due to medication.

In the evening:
I start with **albolene moisturising cleanser** again ordered this from the US. says its mineral oil based, goes on like vaseline and comes off with dry tissue/cotton wool (am I oil cleansing? am I doing it right?)
I'll then use the clarins facewash again if my skin feels greasy still.
Then I apply the **Adapalene** from the doctor (using this just on breakout areas - jawline, forehead, back)
then finish up with the same moisturiser from the morning.

since introducing the albolene, I feel I'm getting some real changes in skin texture - pores maybe tightening a bit? less dry patches (which occasionally crop up)...

Suggestions? UK product replacements that I should try?

Thanks so much folks :)

That is my personal view.

Putting aside the actual policies contained to start with: the Green manifesto is far far far more detailed than the Labour one. It is also better presented. 

The Labour manifesto has absolutely no detail on 'overall' costings; and I can't find any sort of appendix that provides them. 

The Green manifesto however provides a comprehensive overview of the full tax and spend costings, with detailed tables for every proposed tax and spending decision. 

Now the policies themselves may not be things you agree with; and I don't agree with many myself (particularly in the intersection of animal rights/scientific work) but to completely dismiss most of the radical spending/taxes the policies as 'pie in the sky' or mad before actually giving the manifesto a read would be foolish.

&gt;I actually didn't include Germany in the list of countries comparable when you look at the statistics, because they don't outperform us in any of the metrics I found.

Fair enough, I just assumed that when you said a quarter you were talking about the top 12, which includes Germany by any measurement. 

&gt;I think there are 3 countries that are objectively better than us in road safety and that is Norway, The Netherlands and Sweden. The countries that I called comparable outperformed us in one metric, but we outperformed them in another. I think that's fair. If you want to look at how close countries like Germany are then it makes our safety record look even less spectacular and less worthy of boasting about.

Yes, and my point is that if you're considering Norway objectively better than the UK, then the UK is objectively better than Germany, France, Italy and Spain which if we're being honest, are the only comparable countries in Europe.

Lovren - 6.0 (Gave an unawarded penalty that Newcastle has every reason to be incensed about, still seeing mistakes from him)

Moreno - 7.0 (Still not confident in his defending abilities, but great wide addition to attacks)

Lucas - 8.0 (The only good thing about Gerrard being out is that Lucas is 100% forced into the team who is just an exponentially better fit shapewise. Showing his discipline and composure in deep midfield.)

Allen - 8.0 (One of his best performances in Liverpool's shirt. This lad has found form. Wish he was taller for those headers lol)

Henderson - 8.5 (Great performance, starting to be routine for him again after a rough patch of form)

Coutinho - 9.0 (I'm out of clean underwear)

Sterling - 8.0 (Good running, fantastic goal but really could've had a hat trick if he kept his mind switched on for the Coutinho ball and just taken his time with the 1 on 1, he has to work on finishing. And get a new agent, his current one's a knob)

Ibe - 6.5 (Needs work to keep his spot, perhaps he got too used to the wingback position?)

Borini - 6.5 (Unconvinced once again. He needs to justify not just his spot on the bench, but his spot on the team. I entirely expect him to be sold in the summer)

If you remember that the Lib Dems are the result of a merger of the Liberal party and the Social Democratic party, with the Liberals being the old Whigs, and the SDP being a splinter group from the Labour party, then I'm on the right hand end of the right hand right hand half of the partnership. I'd probably be a member of the Conservatives if I trusted them more on matters of personal liberty, but they've got far too long and far too recent a history of authoritarianism for my taste.

My preferred outcome from the election would be another LiberaTory coalition.

Not as turbulent as the situation in ukraine at the moment.

Firstly the situation is far more complex than simply russia bullying ukraine, for example do you think that russia would have let Yanukovych fall if it they were a nuclear state? No chance Russia would have risked having an anti-russian state with nuclear weapons so close.

So no I don't think them having nuclear weapons would have prevented the current situation. Plus ignoring how nukes would have changed how the situation happened entirely, imagining we're in the situation of Yanukovych having just been ousted for power then nukes still wouldn't have made a difference since it would not be credible for the nuclear weapons to have been used against russia in the situation. The nuclear deterrence only works when the use of nuclear weapons is seen as credible.

That's certainly a popular opinion among many politicians and the public, but I think you'd be hard pressed to find many ranking people in the British military who feel that way.

I'm entirely positive however that you would not be able to find a single military officer in favour of NATO unilaterally getting rid of its nuclear arsenal, and leaving only Russia, China, Pakistan, India, Israel, and North Korea with nukes.

That being said, my main EL concern is our atrocious record on the weekend after Thursday games. Its just horrendous. Not only would we actually be in the 4th place discussion if Thursdays were never a factor, you would have to think team morale and energy would be higher as well. 


I like the EL, I really do, but I also want to attract great talent that likely is only going to come with being in the CL. Liverpool and Man U missing EL and then making CL the next year is huge and cannot be ignored. They can not only draw great talent as a result, but they will bring in a ton of money too. Like it or not, thats what the game is about today. I am perfectly happy forgoing potentially slim glory in the EL now, miss it next year, and make a solid CL-qualifying run.


I think it is unrealistic with our current squad talent and depth to be able to really compete in four competitions at once - the biggest clubs in the world have this challenge, let alone Spurs. Rather than have very very slim chances at winning something in four tournaments, I'd like to dramatically increase our chances in only two of them. As the EL is the most draining (and the thing we have the second lowest chance of winning, next to the whole PL), I say that should be what we obviously lose. As we win things, we then increase our abilities, and rationale for trying to compete in more tournaments.

Organic is a meaningless buzzword anyway. We need to increase our food production by 50% by 2050 and we need to do so with significantly less use of fertilizer and pesticide, less water input into crops, in the context of increasing erosion, a changing climate and more extreme climatic events like floods and drought. Simply saying smaller organic farms will solve our problems is an enormous over simplification of a very complicated problem with no straightforward solution. The actual solution will likely involve a combination of various approaches, some of which will probably have to involve gmos and large scale farming.

If they have the drive and pure talent to start games for us our manager would start them. They are better off loaned out. Everyone blames our loan program on why some players don't make it. Which is b.s. They didn't make it because they never were good enough in the first place. Most youth players will become a failure. Most didn't have what it takes in the first place. You just have hope they develop. Being a professional football player at the level Chelsea demands is a rare thing.  We will have many more failures than successes. I don't care for the idea that we need to play youth players. Fuck that. They need to earn the right to be played. Our manager chooses players he thinks should play. I respect his decision.

We can't just give that to them. If they play fantastic. But demanding they get time is a joke. There are plenty of ways a youth player can show off his talent and get selected without being throw in a game for just the sake of it. If Jose feels a few are ready and we shouldn't buy anyone in those positions then great. But if he doesn't and goes out and buys someone it's because what he's got isn't ideally what he wants.

null,false,DrHydeous,null,null,null,"OK, so let's imagine that I run a pub. I have some full time staff, but I know that I need one more person on Friday evenings. Should I employ that person full time, even though they're mostly not needed? That would mean I'd have to put prices up, so customers will tend to go elsewhere, and so I'm more likely to go out of business. Or I could just not employ them at all, in which case my customers get worse service on Friday evenings, are likely to go elsewhere, and I'm more likely to go out of business. In both cases, everyone suffers.

Now, let's assume I've found someone who wants to work part time. Hurrah. I can guarantee this person a few hours a week. Hurrah, not a zero hours contract. But what should I do when this person is unexpectedly ill and has to miss a shift? If I'm not allowed to have people on call but not guaranteed any work, then, well, my customers just get shitty service again. Or what if it's that one weekend a year when the bike rally is in town and I need even more staff?

In practice, pubs usually have a small permanent staff, and several part-time workers, many of whom are on technically zero hours contracts but in practice get a small number of regular shifts plus sometimes other shifts on top. The real situation is that given a decent employer, zero hours contracts benefit everyone. The employer benefits, the casual worker benefits, the customer benefits. They only suck when the employer is an arse and abuses them. The majority of employers aren't arses, and companies run by arses tend to not do very well because a poor attitude towards their staff goes hand in hand with a poor attitude towards their customers.",null,0,null,1429022445,null,0,false,0,cqbzv6n,null,t3_32inaa,null,t1_cqbzv6n,null,t1_cqbyf2g,null,null,null,1432384599,null,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3,null

I don't know, but it's something worth considering if financials are a consideration, because in fact if you hit some of those, they're a bit more social, I think (although I have no actual experience outside of Thornbury several years ago). However, I absolutely understand what you mean.

The logistical reasons are frankly innumerable though. Ignoring UKU's terrible grasp of Geography (hey Bangor), the fact that teams have to submit their team applications this year is just ridiculous. Take Durham, who last year comfortably had enough for 2 Open and 2 Women's teams, but this year have notably struggled for numbers. How can they possibly make a call on how many teams they want to enter based on previous years. I'm sure they aren't the only team in this position (I know Cambridge managed to enter 3 teams to regionals the last 2 years, where previously they were scrapping for players for a second team).

 local spit and sawdust grotty pub for a 5 quid Sunday dinner that is tinned veg and crap quality meat.

I bought a single unit of these (one order on Amazon) and received two boxes with two intercoms in. The supplied fitting kit is really awesome - it has a ""clip"" mechanism which sadly didn't work for either of my helmets and also a super sticky adhesive velcro patch. I opted for the latter and they cling to both my helmets like they were glued on - seriously impressed with that, as security on the helmet was something I was really keen on getting right. I didn't want to loose a £200+ Scala on the motorway!

Audio quality - really outstanding for the price. Each intercom comes with a lengthy boom mic that can be adjusted and moved about and are made pretty well considering. Each intercom also has a two speakers with sticky adhesive pads and velcro to go in the helmets. Me and my SO can hear each other at speeds of 70-80mph no problem in high winds. Music is really good quality but I've only tested it as I don't like to ride with music on, so can't comment with music at speed.

Build quality - really good. For the price you wouldn't expect it but these are built really well. I've had mine with me on every ride for about 2 months now and they have survived heavy rain and hail so far. Cannot fault it. Ease of use is also great. Once paired with each other, the intercoms need one button press from power on to reestablish the link and open a comm channel.

Batteries - brilliant! We've charged ours about 3 or 4 times since getting them. I use mine everyday as a Bluetooth handsfree kit, but when they're just ""idling"" and not engaging in any calls or anything these use very, very little power. I left my intercom on once when I went to bed and paired to my phone, the unit still had enough juice to take me to/from work without a charge.

Grumbles? None. At all. You don't need a Bluetooth phone to use these, they just use the Bluetooth protocol to communicate. It's two-way and you can have a conversation using them. These turned my pillion adventures from an ordeal into a serious but of phone. Honestly, they're worth every penny in my view. I am seriously impressed and would order some more of these if I ever had the need. Begs the question what Scala and the other big brands do different - durability might be an issue but like I've said above, I haven't noticed any deterioration in quality since taking receipt.

null,false,TheAnimus,null,null,null,"&gt; This is a bank creating money not you. They then charge you interest for having loaned you the money they created

No because no bank was involved in that transaction, no credit charge applied.  I've a habit of doing this all the time with some of my local shops, that I've been going to for ages, one, because I always forget they stopped taking card and don't always carry enough cash, because, urgh, cash, another cycle shop because I don't bring my wallet when I go for a nice weekend ride, but figure I should change the brake pads.  They know me, they know my bicycle, they know my address, they are happy to lend me £5.  This isn't underwritten by a bank.

That is how money is 'created' in the sense.  The other example I used is one commonly found in organisations accounting departments.  If you'd ever, you know, run a company, you'd appreciate why often cash flow is a problem, but you might be familiar with your counterparties order books, so you agree a future payment date.  This again, isn't underwritten by a bank, as the amounts are too small to be worthwhile.

Basically, since the 09-10 season we always go through terrible period from late February to **mid April consistently. And we tend to cancel out big emotional wins with losses the very next game (Chelsea win followed by Crystal Palace loss, NLD win followed by Liverpool loss/West Ham tie). Here's how it's looked for the last few seasons:

2010-11: Late February to early May had a record of 1 win, 6 draws, 3 losses.

2011-12: Late February to end of April had a record of 2 wins, 3 draws, 5 losses, all starting from a massive second half capitulation in the NLD.

2012-13: NLD win in early March followed by two preventable losses against Liverpool (2 ridiculous mistakes led to goals) and Fulham, with draws against Everton (in b/w Europa games) and Wigan (who were relegated) in the following weeks.

2013-14 (I know it was never really in the cards, but damn it I had hope for a second after we beat United on New Years!): Timmy having only dropped points twice until late February, goes on to lose 3 of the next 4 games in March...again, though, we weren't ever close to being in the hunt for the top 4.

Part of it might be our Europa league excursions, but even after we got knocked out of the Champions League in 2011, we went on a pretty mediocre run as well (albeit we didn't have great depth). Unfortunately, we need to be patient with this team, keep consistency with the management, and let them develop a mentality where they can start stringing numerous wins in a row. I like Europa league, and as I mentioned in an earlier thread, I do think we can win it with the right transfers over the summer.

central bank money to create new loans and deposits**.

null,false,justNickoli,null,null,null,"&gt; You say running hospitals; does that include maintenance, or can that be outsourced to MITIE?
&gt; Or does running a hospital refer to cleaners, groundskeepers, etc, or could that be outsourced?

The question is what is the contract for? Outsourcing cleaners and groundskeepers is not running a hospital. I would prefer they didn't, but it's not the same.

&gt;Or are you referring to the ownership of the building? Surely in some circumstances renting the building from an estates company might be preferable.

No, but who rents the building, the NHS, or a private company?  Renting the building is very unlikely to be the best option, though. My local hospital rents some of its buildings, and it causes them problems. They can't attach anything to the walls, because the landlord won't let them. The hospital rooms have TVs that instead of being wall-mounted opposite the bed, are mounted on a long, expensive, swing arm attached to the service panel that has the oxygen supply, call button and so on in it.  

&gt;Or is it the land under the hospital that's important? Surely 100 year leases make some land use arrangements affordable.

&gt;Or are you referring to individual outpatient or lab operations? 

&gt;What's wrong with letting the manufacturer of an MRI being allowed to staff and run their own suite, or a private clinic serving private patients within an NHS hospital, on the proviso they absorb excess demand during spikes and busy periods?

That's much closer to the point, and like I said, it's a question that at some point needs to be asked, and people will have different views on what is important to be kept in house.

One of the big things to me is who employs medical and care staff, that should be an NHS employer, not private sector.

Before outsourcing something, you need to ask the question ""Will it matter if they make it cheaper by making it worse, especially in a way that can't be easily measured?"" and ""What will the contractor be pushing its staff to achieve, and how will that impact other things we care about?""",null,0,null,1429024662,null,0,false,0,cqc16eq,null,t3_32inaa,null,t1_cqc16eq,null,t1_cqc0cmr,null,null,null,1432385217,null,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1,null

null,false,TheAnimus,null,null,null,"&gt;Creating money out of thin air is a pretty good metaphor for how money is created.

No, no it's not.  Let me give you a programming idea, as I think they are more accessible than mathematics.

     function foo(money) {
           sometimes_go_wrong();
           return money;
     }

Simple right, we call foo, giving it money, and we get the same money back.  Brilliant right?  Except it doesn't work every time.  Sometimes the money isn't returned.  Ok, it happens only about 10% of the time that it isn't returned, so we will only use foo if it returns 10% more!

     function foo(money) {
           sometimes_go_wrong();
           return money*1.1;
     }

Now obviously it takes a while to do that.

     function foo(money) {
           wait_a_painful_long_time();
           sometimes_go_wrong();
           return money*1.1;
     }

Ok, so we are calling foo 10 times.  We have a pretty good idea on what the outcome will be.  Why actually wait for that to happen?  I mean, we know the likely outcome.  Ok we can't be certain, so lets use some confidence intervals to narrow it down, we could say that we can count on getting only half the money we expect from out model.  So why not use that money today?  It's not created out of thin air, it's got value because of the expected outcome.  This is how most things in life work, buy an apple, you are expecting it to be tasty, you probably won't inspect it thoroughly before you leave the store, you will pay, take it home, put it in the bowl and eat it a few days later.

- the removal of the NI upper threshold
- abolishment of the capital gains personal allowance
- reduction of tax relief on pensions
- reform of inheritance tax
- the removal of landlord mortgage relief

Well, throw in not merely rudeness but threats - some of them pretty graphic (Sue Perkins mentioned someone who had said she should be burned to death, that's pretty nasty) - and multiply it by dozens or hundreds of twats, and it can really have a big effect.

2) Not being successful, due to the security systems in place, overall political control being in Russia and generally the interlinked nature of the relevant military and security services at the time.

3) Would have resulted in a crushing invasion if they even got a tiny step towards access to the weapons.

4) Which would have had the total support (and most likely direct help) of western nations, and would have left Ukraine a defeated pariah state for many years.

Illaramendi- would be expensive, but he is a possibility.  Somewhat of a similar position to Krychowiak though.  Arsenal tried to get him in January as I recall and I think Inter Milan and AC Milan are both interested as well.

Sven Bender- For me, he's not better than Lucas.

Kevin Strootman- Roma look set to be in the CL next year, so I think he might be difficult to convince.  Also, Roma would want a fortune as I don't think they want him to leave.

Jordy Clasie- One we could probably get.  I haven't seen much of him so I can't say much more.  Do you really think him better than Lucas/Can?

Javi Martinez- still coming back from injury I thought? Really don't think we could get him, to be honest.

That being said, the fact that they're not being played doesn't necessarily mean that they're not good enough or not ready. A player may be ready, but before actually getting time in a senior-level game there's always an element of risk that their talent, mentality, etc. won't translate from training to the real thing. Furthermore for loans, like transfers, there's always an element of risk that players coming in from outside won't adapt to the group, style, league, etc. The older and more experienced a player is, the less risk. However, with young players that have high ceilings, the payoff for that risk may be greater than bringing in a more established player who's quality is more well known. 

Mourinho has basically said as much, most recently in reference to Loftus-Cheek when he said that he's ready to play but the risk is too great to introduce in the midst of a title challenge. The problem from the fans' perspective is that Chelsea will almost always be in the midst of challenging for one trophy or other, so players who the club have spent time and resources developing and are now ""ready"" won't be risked despite a *potential* reward proportional to that risk. Arguably continuing as we have done is a more sensible strategy, and we shouldn't take those risks. High-risk/high-reward is another legitimate strategy, and the tension between those two is at the heart of the ""youth"" debate.

This model doesn’t exist in reality,  therefore banks are no longer operating under a fractional reserve banking system.

Whatever happens, these kinds of changes will take years to produce any benefit because you still have to wait for the people to die for the tax to take effect, and the baby-boomers (the wealthiest demographic by a fat margin by virtue of how many of them there are) are still a good 10 years off mass extinction. Any benefit from inheritance tax will benefit people who are teenagers now. It seems like there's an entire generation who, for whatever reason, are going to be shut out of owning their own home, and that will roll on for generations anyway.

And perhaps even more interestingly is that Federal advocates in Europe have already said they'd want to extend Associate Membership to the UK if it left, which means not only a trade deal, but the express option to opt in such cultural and education programmes as Norway and Switzerland do.  H2020 Association Agreements have also been signed with the likes of Israel and Turkey.  Even the Ukraine has been given permission to ratify an AA H2020 deal.

    ""Those states, like the UK, which may decide not 
     to take the federal step forward can opt for the 
     status of associate membership. It is ironic that 
     one of the few European leaders to call openly for 
     a fiscal union (albeit without the UK) is Mr 
     Cameron. Other leaders need to admit the fallacy

     united without the installation of a strong federal 
     government.""

Glen Johnson - 4/10 - Judging by a lot of you're ratings it may have come off differently on TV or if you were sat somewhere else in the ground, but from where I was he was dreadful. Showed some fight... However that was when he got into a fight.

Emre Can - 7.5/10 - Has been in the back 3 so wasn't sure if he would work in a formation which had only 2 cb's but took to it quite well, however it was only Newcastle so he might get tested more against better opposition. Extra 0.5 points for being Emre Can.

Dejan Lovren - 5.7/10 - Solid game, good to see him doing a hell of a lot better than he once was though. Should have given away a penalty so 0.3 off for that.

Alberto Moreno - 5.5/10 - Same as Lovren really, good game especially after his performances vs United and Arsenal. 1 point off for wrecking the Phil Coutinho backheel by passing to nobody... 0.5 added because I can't hate that lad too much.

Lucas Leiva - 8/10 - Did a fantastic job in the middle of the park and did quite well with his tackles. Almost got his leg broke, played on. Soldier.

Joe Allen - 8/10 - Similar to Lucas really, played a good game and did what was needed. A player who will win you a battle but not the war and he certainly won the battle. 0.2 added as he scored a goal in front of The Kop. Well in Joe.

Jordan Henderson - 8/10 - Guess the entire midfield bossed it the same amount as Jordan was brilliant as well. Brilliant pass into Raheem for the first and seemed to be in the game a lot. Solid performance from the captain.

Phil Coutinho 114032/10 - Words do not describe how much I love this lad. £8 Million... EIGHT. MILLION. POUNDS. Biggest steal of the century. Nice one Inter. 114022 points added for being Phil Coutinho.

Raheem Sterling - 7.5/10 - Basically showed why he should get £150k a week and why he shouldn't over the 90 minutes. The finish is magnificent, however he should have a hat trick tonight. His first miss made me wonder if I was on laughing gas. 

Jordon Ibe - 6/10 - Looked a bit rusty but he's just coming back from injury so I'll let him of with it.  Lost the ball a bit, maybe if he was 100% he could have done better. 

Fabio Borini - 6/10 - Was just there, surprised he didn't score. He tends to love a goal vs Newcastle.

Rickie Lambert - 6/10 - Probably should have been Brannagan who came on instead, game was sorted so give him his debut especially as he's been on the bench for the past few weeks.

I noticed that the battery life has significantly reduced. When I got it first time, it used to last around 9h rider to pillion. Last couple of times I tried, it lasted around 5h with bluetooth audio + rider to pillion.

Pakistan has 3x more warheads than it did 10 years ago. 8 new, likely nuclear capable, submarines just bought from China. And test fired new medium range missiles too. So much for non proliferation.

China are also expanding their nuclear arsenal and making more warheads. And again, improving missiles technology. They're also adding new nuclear submarines and plane delivery systems too. 

And Russia... Not included in this article, but do we really need to say anything about Russia?

So there you have at least two of the nuclear powers openly expanding their capabilities. We are talking about REPLACING our existing, ageing submarines. They are adding NEW submarines, more missiles, planes etc. 

Couple that with this second article from today:

NATO are basically lazy bastards, overly reliant on the US. But the U.S. are also citing their military spending. Almost nobody is spending the 2% of GDP that they are supposed to. And again, China, Russia and others are massively renewing and expanding their military capabilities. The UK has good kit but fuck all numbers. 6 type 45 destroyers. 4 trafalgar submarines. Only about 100 eurofighters. We absolutely need out nuclear deterrent to balance things out, since NATO is heading downhill and likely incapable of fighting a conventional war anyway.

-  Make sure you are on the electoral roll
-  Make sure you are on the bills, particularly the council tax bill.
-  Sky/Virgin 12 month contract?  If you have one, make sure it's in your name.
- Mobile phone contract. Sim only is fine on a 30 day rolling contract.  But get one.  Pay n go is fine and dandy with all these packages you can buy.  But the deals are the same as that AND get you a credit history.
- Credit card.  Get one from your bank account supplier so it's all in one place.  Don't worry about rates etc on it, because you will never need ""good rates"" because you are gonna pay it off every month right?  Right?  If you see the benefit as a tool at a later date, then you can start shopping around.
- If you've done all this, perhaps consider 0% finance deals if you are buying something big.  DO NOT do them however unless you have the cash to buy them out.  Putting stuff on finance is a shitty thing to do, and a lost job, or accident at work can start seriously messing with lives.  Put that money in a savings account, never touch it, and reap the nice credit notes.  If done properly it will cost you nothing while the ""£1000"" you had for the TV is gathered interest somewhere else.

If we don't make it, next season will be even harder. I think QPR, Burnley and Sunderland will all come down. Sunderland will struggle, but the others should keep the bulk of their squads whilst receiving large fees for the likes of Austin, ings and Vokes, enough to buy a
player more than capable of firing them back up. You also have to consider the teams that won't go up this season. Depending on the play offs, Derby, boro, Watford and Ipswich could all stay down, plus the likes of forest and Cardiff, who should have done better this season.

I had a terrible experience with stridex due to the menthol but I switched from Paula's Choice 2% to this and noticed a huge difference immediately. Like I said before, it actually stung which worried me initially, but the difference to my skin made the discomfort worth it, and there was no irritation beyond a minute or so. I would patch test first just to be certain, of course. 

I have super dry skin and use this daily with no problems, though in the last couple of weeks I've had a few dry patches so switched to using it every other day, with the same results only less dryness. The instructions say to use it a few times a week which confused me as the website says you can use it daily. I went straight to using it daily with no problems. 

I use sebamed's clear face gel, as even though my skin is very dry it's acne prone and cream moisturisers seem to exacerbate this. Most nights I apply this and then a layer of vaseline when I feel like I need a more intensive moisture boost.

Even as much of a bully Putin has been, the idea of retaliating against Russian invasion with nuclear weapons would *clearly* be an over-reaction.

People in NI and outside are much more tolerant of other people and other faiths than in the past. The support by unionist politicians of things like the Reverend calling Muslims satanist, banning gay people donating blood etc etc make them look so unbelievably backwards.

2 - The erosion of the Union.

Scotland came really close to independence. English people are waking up to the idea of their own independence. Sinn Fein may soon be in power in the South. It's only a matter of time - perhaps centuries though - before the break up of the union. This may not mean a united Ireland but it will happen.

Without Sinn Fein to complain about, the DUP and TUV would seem so backwards and ridiculous with their religious interference in people's lives and the sheer arrogance of some members (Sammy Wilson, Gregory Campbell). The UUP are dead as it is so they would just disappear.

She got a LOT of flak for her presenting of Thronecast, but nothing significant. It looks more like she couldn't handle the mountain of criticism and is cherry picking a few dumb comments like everyone was doing it.

A lot of people including the Eleventh Doctor say that it was the War Doctor who broke the promise and decided to fight in the War but that is untrue. It was the Eighth Doctor who broke the promise and made the conscious decision to fight in the Time War. The War Doctor only fought because that is what he was regenerated to do.

So why does the Eighth Doctor do this? Because over the course of centuries the whole universe is torn down, corrupted, and destroyed to an almost infinite degree. He has to see many of his own people become far more twisted and destructive than those he considers his worst enemies. Despite the evils of the war he is considered a coward by some for not joining the war. Even then, however, the Doctor knows he is not totally innocent in the War having committed himself to events that caused/started the War (especially his decision as Seven to destroy Skaro).

He cannot even prevent his own family and closest companions from being hurt by the Time War. And when the War reaches its peak, he is seen as a monster by someone he is trying to help. In the end he basically decides to die for good with his morals intact. But what does the universe give him for this, his last ""good"" deed. It sees him resurrected and he is goaded and guilted into joining the War. He was likely aware of the millions of people living and dying in endless cycles of misery and probably could have expected something similar for himself had he not made the decision to regenerate into the War Doctor.

And all of this happens to one of the initially most happy, joyous and romance involved Doctors.

null,false,yungliteskin,flair8,,null,"What people need to realize about Pochettino is that he definitely had the worst squad out of the previous 4 managers. Not only that, but he hasn't been in the job a year, so it really is quite reactionary and bizarre to claim he hasn't accomplished anything, what exactly would you constitute a success so far from him? Our squad is no where near top 4 quality, and our progression in other competitions suffered due to fixture congestion, these things can't be helped. I am largely going to focus my response on Sherwood v Poch, as your post seems to lean heavily toward that.

We can talk all we want about Harry Kane's heroics this season, but on sheer quality and ""game breaker"" ability alone you'd be insane not to take an Adebayor with a point to prove or a Gareth Bale. 

Harry had both, Sherwood had Ade, Poch has neither. Not only that, but Sherwood had been around the club for years before stepping into the manager role, Poch was new to the club and the entirety of our playing staff. This reflects in the time it took at the beginning of the season during which time every single player was allowed a chance to prove themselves. Our results were poor, but nonetheless a manager needs time to learn his squad before he can have a meaningful impact on the side.

If we break it down and look at stats alone, Sherwood was in charge of about half the games Poch has been in all comps (28 vs 51), yet has a lower win percentage across those games (57.14 vs 61.76). 

Stats aside, if we look at our performances across both managers, Sherwood managed a 5-1 capitulation against City at home, and awful 4-0s against Chelsea and Liverpool. This tendency to capitulate against the big teams was a problem all of last season and he had no meaningful impact to negate that. Admittedly there were good performances, standout 4-0 and 5-1 wins against Newcastle and Sunderland respectively, although largely due to the faults of those two sides. 

Poch on the other hand has wins at home against current #1 and #2 in the league, including scoring 5 goals against Jose's Chelsea for the first time ever. We also took a point off United at the Lane, showed well at Anfield and still have City to play at home. The difference being that we've actually been able to show up and show well against the big teams.

I wouldn't say the jury is out on Poch, I would say the jury is out on our fan base. After last season many of us claimed we would take 6th-7th and a cup run, which is what we got. Admittedly we've had two disappointing results on the trot, but we are at a point in our season where we have little to play for and are coming up against teams fighting for their lives. Also, we are showing signs of fatigue as Poch has identified out of our 25 man squad the 13-14 he actually trusts.

TL;DNR Poch is doing a great job, it's our expectations as fans that make it look differently. He has an average squad and Tactics Tim did nothing special at all.

*  “Islam is a cancer that needs eradicating multiculturism does not work in this country clear them all off to the desert with their camels that’s their way of life.” (UKIP member Ken Chapman, hoping to be elected to Amber Valley Borough Council in Derbyshire, last year)

* “I visiting the city of Birmingham recently and felt like a foreigner in the city of my birth, all around me I could hear the sound of jabbering in an alien voice … we also have the Pakistani’ and the Somali’s. Tell me Mr Cameron Why? the men wear their Pyjamas.” - councillor Dave Small (since sacked for being *too openly* racist)

* UKIP MEP Godfrey Bloom stating that the UK should stop foreign aid to ""Bongo bongo land"" and that foreign aid went to ""foreigners who bought Ray-Ban Sunglasses and Paris Apartments"" with the money.

* ""#ThingsAsianBoysDo groom and rape underage white girls, stab and rob innocent old white people, bomb innocent white people #EctEctEct” (Council candidate for UKIP James Elgar)

* “Most Nigerians are generally bad people… I  grew up in Africa and dare anyone to prove me wrong.” (Andre Lampitt)

* “I think if black people come to this country and don't like mixing with white people why are they here? If he (Henry) wants a lot of blacks around go and live in a black country.” [After Lenny Henry suggested more black/ethnic people should be in the creative industry] - Candidate William Henwood

* “Well, I reckon dogs are more intelligent, better company and certainly better behaved than most Muslims.” - Joseph Quirk, former UKIP candidate (also shared a *lot* of anti-semetic conspiracy theory bollocks)

* Gerard Batten, UKIP’s chief whip and immigration spokesman, believes that all UK Muslims should sign up to a special code of conduct, and wants mosque building to be banned. [The full document can be read here](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/interactive/2014/feb/04/charter-muslim-ukip-gerard-batten)

* Camden UKIP chairman Magnus Nielsen made headlines after describing Islam as ‘organised crime’. Now standing for Hampstead and Kilburn, Nielsen says that his ‘great aim’ is to licence mosques. Asked if he would prescribe the same for Jewish and Christian places of worship, he said that this would not be necessary.

* [Former Offerton councillor Harry Perry’s Twitter feed is astonishing. As well as prolific sharing of material about the ‘sin of feminism’ and the ‘disease’ of homosexuality, Perry is obsessed with the idea of ‘white genocide'](https://twitter.com/harryperry15)

* ""Asian Muslims groom our white girls, now they rape our boys. Jordanian Paralympians commit sex offences. We need to reclaim our country"" - [Ron Northcott](https://twitter.com/RonNorthcott)

* After the death of Nelson Mandela, West London UKIP member David William Griffiths wrote in the members-only forum that some people were ‘intended by nature’ to be slaves. Meanwhile Pamela Preedy, secretary of UKIP’s Redcar branch, questioned why Mandela’s death had received so much coverage since he ‘had nothing to do with Britain’.

* Newport East candidate Donald Grewar was forced to resign after he apparently backed a post by the EDL, calling for ‘no surrender to militant Islam or political correctness’.

* “On 1 January 2014 the floodgates will open for Bulgarian and Romanian citizens [to come to Britain].
 “We are not just talking about pressure on services from immigration but also, and I have to say it, the crime associated with Romanians.” - Diane James is UKIP MEP for the South East of England

* In 2013, the then Stourport-on-Severn councillor Eric Kitson was questioned by police after he shared anti-Muslim cartoons on Facebook. In one particularly memorable post he said of Muslim women: ‘Hang um all first then ask questions later.’

null,false,HistoryLessonforBitc,,Card-carrying Labour supporter,null,"They still have an absolutely absurd view of growth. I can't copy and paste, because they are total numpties and have made their PDF as a bunch of images, but they have a completely idiotic view of, if not an utter ignorance of, basic economics. This is why I say they are lunatics and would run screaming in the opposite direction were I to even think of voting for them. I am all for more public spending and more redistribution but it is essential that that goes along with a growing economy (something David Cameron is actually right on as a point of fact), and that the Greens fail to recognise that makes them totally non-credible.

Check page 11 of their twatty PDF. Their basic view is that growth is not a universal good, and therefore they don't intend to pursue it, as they think GDP is not the be all and end all. Technically, they are right, however they are wrong to eschew economic growth entirely as they would quickly find all of their plans unsustainable. Public spending is more or less entirely built on growth - the knowledge that there will be a return on the investment made, that if you feed money into the economy now it will come back in multiples due to growth feeding tax revenues and consumer spending, which feeds revenues, which feeds spending... there is a never-ending circle. The Greens cannot deny this so they seek to obfuscate it - bringing in poverty statistics and income inequality and blaming them on economic growth, things which have absolutely nothing to do with growth itself and everything to do with bad government policy and misallocations of the proceeds of growth. They either fail to see or deliberately ignore that if growth doesn't occur, there is no way they can pay for greater social security spending, higher spending or anything else in their manifesto. 

A stagnant or shrinking economy can be revived with government spending, but deliberately targeting a stagnant or shrinking economy and then spending massively on it is utterly mental. Old Labour, for all its faults, understood that you did need a functioning economy to pay for public spending (which we do need). The *Soviet Union* understood it. The Greens deny it. They don't want to stimulate the economy to pay for their spending, and they're not spending to stimulate the economy, they are planning to spend just for the sake of it and think it somehow reconciles with a flat income. This shoots massive holes in their credibility. You cannot have no growth but also massive spending forever more. It doesn't work. It will fail. It is destined to fail. The end result would be either permanent austerity or bankruptcy.

This of course does not mean in the slightest that the Conservatives' relentless sucking up to big business is justified, as economic growth *isn't* the be all and end all. However, the argument needs to be made (as Ed Miliband has) that growth causes a feedback loop through the country, which is something that benefits everyone when properly managed and directed in the right ways by government - and in some cases directly stimulated by government.

The thing is, when you subscribe to a forum whose sidebar includes things like,

&gt;In the interests of enduring civil, open debate, and in light of the reasons for our subreddit's foundation, /r/BritishPolitics is somewhat more sternly moderated than ""the other place"" on certain points. [...] Racism, homophobia, sexism, and general bigotry are not welcome. [...] This rule applies equally to dog whistles.

it means you've subscribed to that philosophy, which does necessarily rely on trusting the moderators' discretion. It's actually worked quite well, and the subreddit has been growing from strength to strength (until very recently, at least) over the last ten months. If you lose faith in the moderators, that's unfortunate and you should consider messaging us about it, but there are ultimately other forums about British politics on this website with much laxer moderation policy.

For your post in particular, I would probably let it slide, but the reason we're introducing this new rule in the first place is that it's hurting the quality of discussion. We're hoping that with this in place and enforced a bit more heavily than we would normally, we'll get to a point where occasional jokes (if funny) can stay. In a few weeks I might not have removed it. Sorry again, though.

Edit: Oh, and as to upvotes. That's why we have a moderation policy. If low-effort stuff wasn't getting upvoted we'd have no need.

This is the third time now I've felt compelled to reply to you. You're such a bloody martyr. 

&gt;Economically they want to reduce the state and reduce taxes and empower the individual yet this lot would have you believe they are baby killing monsters.

Just they aren't very honest about it. And are embroiled in much more sleaze than the left. Frankly I'm not arsed about people ""demonising"" the Conservatives. 

This insidious idea of empowering the individual is just self-congratulatory wankery to me. Let's tell everyone that it's the poor's fault they're poor; then take away lots of great opportunities they have at bettering themselves. 

Since Thatcher we've had a distinct lack of representation in politics and the media of the working class. I would love to believe they honestly think that reducing the state would ""empower the individual"" but really it feels like just a group of people afforded every possible advantage in life telling the homeless they aren't working hard enough. 

&gt;They are socially liberal 

Bullshit are they. This might be personal preference but if they had their way we'd still have a ban on gay marriages. Thank fuck Cameron helped get it through.

The trouble is... one of those is (I think?) illegal, or may result in a conviction due to consequences which could occur, while the other should be considered expected behaviour.

I also found this interesting:

&gt;“We are one of the best integrated countries in Europe,” Maher said. “We have high-level Muslims in politics, including cabinet ministers; among opinion makers and journalists. Unfortunately, in the mid-to-late 1980s and the 1990s, we took in a number of dissidents, a new wave of Muslim preachers, who integrated into the heart of British Muslim life. They spoke Arabic, wore fancy robes and came from the Middle East. They were the ones who opened the debate in the mosques on ‘What is the Caliphate? What role does, or should it play, in everyday Muslim life?’ A lot of young people who go to Syria today were infants when the debate began, so this is what they’ve grown up with; it was the mood music of their lives. And today, ISIS and other recruiters have fed into this. Their message is: It’s better to be a Muslim in Raqaa than living next door to a Christian neighbor in London. And this is something with which an aspiring jihadist can connect.”

Clearly such preachers are out of control.

&gt;This insidious idea of empowering the individual is just self-congratulatory wankery to me. Let's tell everyone that it's the poor's fault they're poor; then take away lots of great opportunities they have at bettering themselves.

I don't believe that's what Conservatives do. I believe the Tories give people who want to escape that cycle the means to do so. I would also state that I find it more insidious that the left spends an awful lot of people that it's someone elses fault they're poor so don't ever feel the need to do anything about it because you're **helpless**.

That is literally the guardians reason d'etre. To convince the poor and working class that it is someone else's fault they're poor and they can't do anything about it. I find it vile. Owen Jones basically wrote a book telling the working class that it was the Tories fault they're poor. 

Why not try to empower people? Is it so 'vile' that, that is what we try to do?

&gt;Let's have some examples of right wing countries and see how they're doing. Seems to me they are more unequal than left wing countries.

Last I checked Australia and America were doing fine. What is this obsession with 'inequality' anyway? As if it's the only metric by which to judge success. It's so ridiculously left wing. The wealth of the working class in both Australia and America has risen substantially. Not everything in society is about making everyone the same.
