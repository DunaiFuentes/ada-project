edit: Bugger, missed the other part of your question. I don't think smoking or vaporising would show much difference, the vast majority of THC metabolism takes place in the lungs before it gets to your blood, but eating it would allow much more absorption, and despite the first pass effect, the liver won't strip out as many molecules as quickly as the lungs would. It'll just end up with a higher conc of plasma THC, and thus a higher level of salivary THC.",null,0,null,1425316420,null,0,1425316614,0,cp1yi0o,null,t3_2xnnbw,null,t1_cp1yi0o,null,t1_cp1t0ox,null,null,null,1427538057,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

I went to Limelight my first night because my friend's friends wanted to dance. I really enjoyed the more rockish room and the middle room over the club, but the club was a good time as well. A few drinks were bought for me because people really enjoyed my beard.

The best time I had in Belfast must have been at the bar with no name. At first we watched people playing guitar downstairs and met some people whilst smoking on the picnic tables outside. Hearing live music, we found the stairs and really had an enjoyable night.

Spent the next two nights in Dublin where we found a nice pub called whiskey palace and a live music venue called the mezz. Danced in the street with strangers while a street singer played for hours. Stayed on Dame st., and realized Dublin doesn't sleep because we heard people partying in the streets until about 7AM. 

I really indulged this whole love for brown sauce while in Belfast and may possibly be sick of the traditional Irish breakfast/the ulster fry.

The best food I had was at St. George's Market where I went to a stand and had sausage/egg in a bap. I've since grown obsessed with these soft baps. Other notable places for food I went to: Maggie May's, Currito, Boojum, The Chip Co., Supermac's (Dublin).

Carrick-a-rede was beautiful, but we kept missing busses so we had to skip Giant's Causeway.

I live in a place where taxis and public transit are not popular, so I really enjoyed getting around by bus, taxi, and train.

My last night was spent at Filthy McNasty's and the bar with no name.

I really appreciate how friendly and welcoming everyone is. I loved the embracing of my accent as opposed to the scolding I anticipated. Northern Ireland and the Republic have both been great and welcoming and I hope to be back again!

If you move here and are a 'student following a course of study which lasts at least six months, or a course that is substantially funded by the UK... Government'. You are entitled to (for most things) free NHS treatment. Similarly, your boyfriend will probably be entitled to free NHS treatment on account of the fact he is here in employment.

When you get to the UK you will need to register with a GP (general practitioner), which shouldn't be too hard with proof of your full-time student status.

Most healthcare on the NHS is free, with the exception of dental care (which is still subsidised), and prescriptions, which cost £8.05 for one prescription, regardless of the length or type of prescription.


Most UK citizens do not have private health insurance, as the NHS will treat most things, and certainly anything life-threatening, although private insurance does exist.

I don't think Lamela is a very good right winger. Virtually everyone has a better weaker foot than he does. It's a huge liability, because he's not fast enough or good enough with his right foot to run past a defender down the line. 

Everyone in the stadium knows he's cutting inside when he gets the ball on the wing, which is why he's always running into 3 players and losing the ball. He's not good enough to beat players when they know what he's going to do, and he's not versatile enough to keep them guessing. I remember seeing stats after we bought him that he had more successful dribbles per game than Bale. Watching his games for Spurs, I have literally no idea how that could have possibly happened. 

The few times he manages to get into space, he's capable of producing a good final ball (the pass to free Soldado against Fiorentina, for example). He's just can't make the space for himself, and to get into a position to receive a pass in space, he crowds Eriksen in the middle and makes it easy for teams to mark both at the same time.

**Price of product:** £3.40 plus P&amp;P for 30g

**Where did you purchase:** Owndoc.com (highly recommended)

**Product claims:** *""Why Infadolan is the best choice for dermarolling after care: Infadolan contains vit. A in non-acid form (0.1% Retinyl Acetate) that doesn't irritate the skin when the skin is ""open"". Infadolan is indicated for the treatment of first degree burns.*

*Vitamin D2 (Ergocalciferol) has been shown to be a potent agonist of the vit. D receptor which stimulates glycosaminoglycan synthesis and transforming growth factor TGF-beta 1, thereby accelerating wound healing. Vit. D2 promotes dermal strength and re-epithelialization as well as enhancing granulation tissue formation.*

*Infadolan contains natural Lanolin - an excellent occlusive. Occluding scars and stretchmarks after rolling postpones peeling and has a beneficial effect on healing. Infadolan is not a cream - it's an occluding ointment and you should only use a very thin layer. Lanolin helps the vit. D enter the skin.""*

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines, mild papulopustular rosacea. Purchased for use after microneedling and because my skin does well with lanolin.

**Your opinion:**  I have made a number of previous purchases from Owndoc and received quality products and good after sales service. Their free online microneedling guide is thorough and regularly updated.

Too right. It is regressive even by the standards of regressive taxes, unique as far as I can tell. If you can't afford road tax you at least have the option of not owning a car. If you are struggling to feed yourself than you will mostly be avoiding VAT. But there would be no escape from this.

For someone on minimum wage, they will have to work 20 hours just to pay the licence fee. People can theorise about how crap like Eastenders is part of our cultural landscape, but tell that to the poor sod who is forced to work 20 hours to pay for it. That is like a community service order without having committed a crime.

For someone on JSA, that is 3 weeks money gone. Are they going to let the poorest people off? Why would they, they don't at the moment. Too poor to buy a licence, don't watch TV. But too poor to pay the levy - tough.

The only fair and practical fund the BBC is through general taxation. Far more important things than the BBC are funded in this way. Provided measures are put in place to avoid political interference in the 5% of the programming which is about politics, who the hell cares where the money comes from to make the crap that fills most of the schedules?

The fact is, City is a new entrant in the elite club, so there are very few old timers who support the club at a national or international level. 

Mark my words, in a decade, the media will favour us a LOT more than they do now.

edit: This is also the reason why new supporters get bashed by old timers in MCFC forums. Because we've not had a big base of supporters as compared to the other big teams, any new supporter comes across as a suspicious glory hunter :-(

Kane, Dier, Bentaleb are all in their early twenties and are all set to have a lot of game time at the club over the coming years- I don't see any of them leaving for minimum 2 or 3 seasons. That is a core CB/CM/CF of extraordinary young, top end talent that few other teams can claim to have. 

Around them we have Eriksen, Lloris and Vertonghen. 3 fantastically exciting players at their peak. Yes they're more likely to get poached by other clubs, but again I don't see them all leaving within 2 or 3 seasons. 

My point is that we may lose 1 or even 2 of the aforementioned players this summer or the coming summer, but none of them are irreplaceable. We are developing a team here rather than hashing together million pound signings as in the past. Surrounding the players I've mentioned we have Davies, Mason, Walker, Rose, Townsend, Lamela, Stambouli... none of whom have reached their peak, but all of whom have shown flashes of very exciting ability over the course of the season.

Our attack needs a lot of fine-tuning. Lamela &amp; Townsend either need to improve their output or be improved on, Chadli needs to be more consistent. We need another centre-forward and our midfielders needs to be reshuffled, but all of this *will* come. We've got the coach to do it now, and he has the squad. Add a Depay or a Moutinho and it'll become a lot more obvious. We have an exceptionally young squad, a squad that is more talented across the board than any since our Champions League year and a high-class coach to match.

One of the reasons Kane earned so many goals is that defenders didn't see him as a threat and gave him space. He exploited that space to create goals. 

In games where he doesn't perform, the defense does the same thing - they crowd him near their own box. If he's crowded in the middle of the pitch, he usually can do a pretty good job of snaking his way out. But when he's crowded at the edge of the box, he does the same thing every time - flicks the ball two meters to his right and tries to create space. Unfortunately, he's pretty slow and defenders/DMs can scoop the ball up. 

This happened a couple times against Chelsea and a couple times against Liverpool. 

I think it's going to be extremely difficult to perform at the same level he has been once defenders realize this.

Well just to avoid what would essentially be repetition.

I'm sorry but the idea that I, in a complex human society cannot harm you with speech acts is just... werid.

I can with words of mouth or pen alone turn you into a monster, the idea that you are not harmed until someone motivated by this rhetoric physically strikes you... is a really really really limited view of harm.

Hell you have to restrict harm literal physical force resulting in constraint or pain alone... something that seems to only make sense in order to burtress a point, not to provide a complete or exhaustive or sufficient definition of harm

&gt;Advertising is a business process that has outcomes and consequences tied to it. For example a company I think should be free to say ""Our product will reduce your hair loss by 10%"", however upon the action of purchasing the product, using it, and finding that my hair loss was not in effect reduced, even by 5%, I would have cause to sue the company for the action of mis-selling a product.
Slander and Libel also have consequences attached. Though I'd argue that the current laws around it should be completely scrapped and replaced with something that places a lot more burden of proof on the plaintiff and limits financial compensation to a means-test. However slander and libel are both tort, not subject to statutory laws - therefore it is a civil matter, not a government one.

I'm sorry mate, how have you not just had to bite the bullet and concede that speech acts can harm you?

You spent a lot of time above talking about the complexity of the actuality of the laws in these cases or what might contitute harm, but you've frankly let the horse out of the gate.

Reality is FSG borrowed ~£9M from a bank between the two years rather than loaning the club more money, which is understandable but not really something I like personally.

Edit:  To show what I mean-

Item|2013|2014|Diff
----|----|----|----
Media|£63.7M|£100.8M|£37.1M
Matchday|£44.6M|£50.9M|£6.3M
Commercial|£97.7M|£103.8M|£6.1M

The increase in Matchday revenue and Commercial revenue (~£12.4M) basically covers the increase in wage bill:

Item|2013|2014|Gain/Loss
----|----|----|----
Wages|£116.1M|£127.2M|£11.1M

So, most of the increase in revenue and therefore our small profit came from 'media', i.e. the older new TV deal, which is what I meant when I said to thank whoever the last contract went to.

From a debt perspective:

Item|2013|2014|Diff
----|----|----|----
Bank loan|£48.1M|£57.8M|£9.7M
Intracompany debt- UKSV|£68.9M|£68.9M|£0

The loan amount from USKV to LFC had a net debt change of 0 while the bank loan increased £9.7M, meaning the owners used the bank for funds rather than granting another intracompany loan.  As I said, this is not necessarily unexpected, but I would personally prefer to see interest free loans from the owners rather than an increase in debt to institutions.  It's not a big deal by any means as an additional £9M isn't going to break us, just that I would prefer it not be going up at all.

Nope - it'd have to leave the EU **before** the case.  While it remains in the EU, it remains bound.  And like I said earlier, if your approach requires us to leave the EU, cancel all treaties and laws that we might run afoul of, it's even more idiotic than before.

&gt;Do you have an example where the UK would be precluded from removing a state benefit?

It can remove it, going forwards it just can't break agreements retroactively.  It's already charged for something under the agreement that it would provide something.  It needs to provide that, or be in breach of that agreement.  I'm not aware of any example simply because no government has been moronic enough to do such a thing (bar extreme cases like the soviet union or zimbabwe forcefully nationalising property and industries - not exactly rousing successes)

&gt;No I'm not. The state pension is a state benefit. Not a promised exchange.

This is false.  Take a look at those links I posted.  The government explicitly states that this is what the fund is for, and exactly what you'll get out of it.

&gt;Because i'm trying to target the old and wealthy's state pension benefits

I asked **why**, not to restate what you're doing.  Why should the *old* and wealthy be charged more than the wealthy in general.  Is age really such a bad thing?  

&gt;Because they're getting back more than they contributed

Not if you take away everything they'd put in.  It's pretty expensive then.  And that is not what ""free"" means.  It means ""without cost"", not ""good value"".  

&gt;How can you have paid for money you didn't contribute in the first place?

Interest.  I put 100 pounds in, earn 5% interest and get 110 pounds out.  It's not terribly complex.  There is a time value to money - money I have to spend now is more valuable than money I'll have in 10 years.  The two are often traded, but they are not equivalent, so comparing one to the other and observing that one is larger is not the same as ""free money"".  There's a cost to giving up what you have now, even if you expect to receive a greater reward later (indeed, this is the whole basis of trade).  But a good trade is not the same as getting something for free.

&gt;National Insurance contributions isn't a savings account.

Duh.  I'm pointing out that ""getting more out than you put in"" is not, in fact, intrinsically wrong.  Indeed, even if my savings account makes bad investments, and lost money, they still owe me the interest they promised, despite me getting ""free money"".  This is because the arrangement given is what is specified in the agreement, not whatever it decides to change it to.

&gt;The majority of pensioners who paid in less than they receive via the state pension are not ""poor"".

My point is that the poor are the ones with the greatest discrepancy here.  **They** are the ones who have the biggest difference between what they have paid in, and what they take out.  Thus if this is the basis you're using, they're the biggest perpetrators.  This does not say all pensioners are poor, it says some pensioners are poor, and they are the ones who have contributed least, while the richest are the ones who **have** put in more than they will ever take out.",null,0,null,1425324278,null,0,false,0,cp23dpr,null,t3_2xcgtz,null,t1_cp23dpr,null,t1_cp1vwxe,null,null,null,1427540403,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

We performed this process in 2012 as well, and it went very well. More than 3,000 submissions were made via Reddit, e-mail, Twitter, Facebook and even snail-mail!

It's also worth noting that we won't just take *any* policy, it has to be in line with [our 7 principles](https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/policy/our-principles/home):

&gt; 1. Our society is built upon the sharing of knowledge, ideas and culture. It is furthered by freedom of thought and expression, and protected by the rule of law. The Pirate Party exists to ensure the preservation and development of these foundations. 
&gt; 2. Human dignity is inviolable. Each of us has a right to life and to live, to freedom of thought and self determination, and to participate in society.
&gt; 3. Everyone is equal under the law. We all have a say in the structure and processes of governance and the right to know what is done on our behalf. 
&gt; 4. Respect for our private and family life by government and society is fundamental and we all have freedom of choice in our associations and relationships.
&gt; 5. To be free to participate in society everyone must have access to justice, education and such services and infrastructure required for life within it. 
&gt; 6. To ensure the security of our society it is the responsibility of the government to provide for its defence, the mechanisms of justice and such services and infrastructure required to meet its needs.
&gt; 7. We will act on the basis of evidence, with the consent of society through democracy, in the interests of all.

Finally, even though we're asking for policy suggestions from everyone, it'll be party members who get to vote on what actually ends up in the manifesto!

I know you brought up sky sports news, which is why I said there are more important things than sky sports news, like the actual news. I was dismissing both the person you replied to and your own argument as being pointless, because the real news is why the BBC is important to keep public run (because it's free of advertiser &amp; share holder pressure). 

&gt;Besides, to claim that BBC News itself does not have any bias (or more importantly, is somehow immune to it) wouldn't be truthful.

Because of the lack of advertisers &amp; shareholders  at the BBC, any bias is not even comparable to other media, who go out of their way to please companies &amp; investors. 

I'm very skeptical of the bias claims thrown at the BBC, as it's an accusation  often thrown from both sides.

Thanks for your vote! Obviously I would've liked to have received more votes, but considering our budgetary limitations (it costs £5k just to stand in one region in the Euros, and that's without any printing costs or other expenses) I think we didn't do too badly. We would've liked to have sent a mail-out to everybody in the North-West for instance (even though having my face land on doormats throughout the major cities is already a little weird).

European regions are huge, so we can focus a lot more energy on the smaller constituencies where we're standing in May. I think we'll be able to do better than in the Euros, actually. In Manchester, Loz Kaye (our party leader) already polls in the ~4% region in local elections.

I don't think we're going to win any seats this time round (although not for a lack of trying!) but I'm sure we'll improve on our previous results and importantly make people aware of the issues and who we are. After every election we've had people comment that if only they'd actually heard of us before they cast their vote they would've voted for us.

True, but then describing these guys as ""ordinary Muslims"" isn't fair, I don't think. For example this isn't seen in other muslims with different (national) backgrounds. I might be wrong, or we might not have heard of them yet of course.

&gt; but nobody said anything out of fear of being seen to criticize the Church

I think it was more the case that the church was too big to criticise. Similar with Savile et al - the power and influence those groups had were the things that kept individuals quiet, or managed to shut them up.

With regard to the groups not wanting to investigate/criticise certain demographics for fear of being seen to be racist... I'm not sure I find that tenable. For one thing it would require a large 'leftist' group of people who would ignore *child rape* over the thought that they might, as a group - not individuals - seen to be going after people because of their skin colour.

I can find greater basis to the idea of not wanting to lend weight to racist attacks and similar, but then again... child rape.

Did the ""didn't want to be seen to be racist"" angle come from internal reports or external, do you know?

&gt; we all heard stories of Muslim rape gangs

You mean ""in general""? I didn't. But then again, even years ago, if you said ""priest"" to me I automatically assumed ""kiddy fiddler"". I don't know why, but even now I'm bemused when people express shock that another clergyman is found doing something nefarious. So I suppose it works the other way around.

CB: Reid is apparently ours, I'm sure we'll hear the news in the coming couple of weeks. 

CF: I'd be jazzed out of my mind if we could get Lacazette, but its probably not going to happen. I'd go for Benteke. Options on others would be Drmic, Mitrovic, or Ings.  

DM: I'd entertain the idea of Veratti for a hot minute. But mostly we should go for Schneiderlin. There's not much of a backup plan in this position that's a step up from what we have, so I think we should prioritize Schneiderlin. 

LW: Depay. We'll compete with United, but I'm not too worried about that right now. There are a lot of other options here that are on our radar (Konoplyanka, Mirallas, Rodriguez). Though I don't believe that Mirallas or Rodriguez offer anything that is that different to Chadli. SO feel out the price for Depay and gauge United's interest and see if we can purchase Depay without overpaying. 

We'll start with a transfer budget of around £30 million I'm assuming.

Look at Mata, Schurrle, Salah in Mourinho's 2 years back at Chelsea. Those players weren't given time to improve, they were just shipped out without mercy. As a man manager I think the top three as far as developing players and managing them as individuals goes are Wenger, Rodgers &amp; Potchiettino.

So an actual decapitating fascist maniac tells you that he is being ""harassed"" by the security services of a country we already know he has an unfounded ideological beef against... and you just take his word for it?

I got a cliché for you: Sounds legit.

&gt;This isn't sympathy for the plight of the guy, but anger at the security services for being incompetent.

What incompetence is that? What exactly has been going on here: MI5 doing their usual shit, identify a guy who is going around making sounds like he wants to get involved with terroristic activities. So they start following him about or whatever, and finally have so much on him that they tell him that he can't take a flight to a place where all the terrorists live. He complains that he's not going to do that, so they say ""Alright... but watch it!""

Then he goes off and becomes a terrorist.

In that context, what are you criticising them for? Not being psychic? Not taking him down an alley and slotting him there and then? 

And what are you trying to suggest about this dude? That he somehow wouldn't have gone to join ISIS if MI5 hadn't let him know that they were aware he was talking shit on the internet and trying to join terror organisations?

Unless you live somewhere really awkward and out of the way, or it's your job, you don't have to drive. Neither do you absolutely need to do drugs (obviously except for medication).

Also the city centre is full of chains, so you sometimes need to get a little out of the centre to get to some of the better independent places.

Here's a few places to Google anyway.

The City Arms on Quay Street (www.thecityarmscardiff.com), opposite the stadium, and The Old Arcade on Church Street (www.sabrain.com/oldarcade) are very atmospheric.

O’Neill’s or Walkabout on St Mary Street, both of which have massive roll-down projector screens are good for match watching.

Mochyn Du (Black Pig) Sophia Close.

Good for Welsh regional ale before watching the rugby on the TV. There are screens dotted around the pub, serves food too – the winter menu includes everything from fish and chips to cawl. (see later)

Another place to drink would be The Goat Major on the High Street.

Wales has some fantastic food and food producers. Traditionally known for leeks, Welsh lamb and Welsh black beef any dish containing those should be good.  Cawl is a traditional Welsh stew or broth made with lamb and veg. Another dish synonymous with Wales would be Welsh Rarebit - a sort of fancy cheese on toast.  You should also try Bara Brith (literally speckled bread) is a fruit loaf made with tea.  Last but not least you need to sample the delights of a Welsh Cake. A small spiced fruit cake cooked on a griddle or bake stone.  Get them from Cardiff Bakestones in the Central Market.

For good value food and drink try Brew Dog, Urban Tap House, Coffee at The Plan in Morgan Arcade or Coffee Barker in Castle Arcade (There's a Tea Barker too if you're that way inclined)

There are loads of great cheap ethnic restaurants around Cardiff.  You'll find some of them on my food blog http://www.corpulentcapers.com and even more on my mate Ed Gilberts http://gourmetgorro.blogspot.co.uk/

He should only cross it if it's the right opportunity and even then he should weight his crosses properly. He does neither and as such his crossing is just as ineffective as Lamela's dribbling.

&gt; Second, you're letting that one Liverpool game cloud your judgement. Since then, Lamela and Townsend have pretty much had the same turnover rate.

Any sensible person can tell the difference between tax avoidance and tax evasion - and those that can't have either fallen foul of political spin, or are too blinded by their own ideals to see the plain and obvious facts. However, equating ""deliberately existing"" forms of tax relief - like ISAs and pensions - to the forms of tax avoidance discussed in this article is disingenuous.

It is of course true that moving money into an ISA relieves the individual of a certain amount of tax liability - much like an individual or company does by moving their profits offshore. But surely no one is under the illusion that the two are somehow comparable. ISAs exist as a deliberate mechanism that allows individuals to save cash, free from taxation on interest earnt. The various tax loopholes under discussion here, whilst perfectly legal to exploit, do not exist deliberately; they comply with the letter of the law, but not with the spirit of the law.

In the past it might have been argued that the BBC was a public good when there were few other options (even if you personally didn't appreciate it) or that it was the only way of producing content without adverts (before digital technologies that can limit content to subscribers), but I think it's a much harder argument to make now.

The question isn't whether people like the BBC, or whether it's good value, it's whether it should be funded from tax at all.

And then you have the issue that with either the current TV license, or the proposed levy, the funding wouldn't be from general (broadly progressive) taxation, but a per-household fee. If it's a public good, rather than a version of a subscription subject to previous technological limitations, why fund it in this way?

Tbh, this is his first season in which he stands out for PSV, nobody would have thought he would be key for lot of assists for the goals for PSV.

Its uncertain how he will develop next year but its certainly that he is not ready for a higher step yet and I think the best place where he can develop himself is at PSV and not at city.

Radio: the BBC were the main players pushing DAB, but resisted any attempts to support subscription services. It wouldn't be difficult to integrate into the next digital radio standard. 

Online: this is the easiest case - there are already plenty of subscription websites out there.

&gt; Given that an overwhelming majority of the population have a TV, and given that a large proportion of those without a TV use some level of BBC Radio or Online services, the notion of using a subscription model to weed out the fraction of a percent who genuinely wouldn't subscribe is ridiculous.

I think a large number wouldn't subscribe, if it wasn't the ""default"" choice and required to watch live TV at all. Surely you can imagine a lot of families who would rather not pull out of £145/year for the BBC if they can still watch other channels, listen to commercial radio, etc? For a lot of families, £145/year is a very substantial amount of money.

Postmen are encouraged in some delivery offices (but certainly not all) to use a pen to run a line through any stamps they see that haven't been cancelled by the sorting machine. Most postmen don't bother though, especially since so many letters haven't been cancelled.

Large letters, apart from those going through Manchester Mail Centre, are almost never cancelled.

You would contend they owe a chunk of corporation tax too, because clearly declaring ""zero profit"" is taking the piss.

You thought I'd have an example of something I'm maintaining that I think it completely idiotic and that no sensible government would do?  Why? Such an example would, if anything, go against my claim.  And I'm not the one claiming to be a legal scholar - I said one would *need* to be one to claim they knew all the obligations this country has regarding payment of debts and obligations, as you have claimed, and I don't even *remotely* believe.  No-one sane would make that claim on the basis of having once written a dissertation on constitutional law, even if I did believe you on that.

&gt;present your case as to how someone could legally challenge the removal of the universal state pension

By bringing a court case and suing the government.  I won't speculate on what approach they'd take - **I'm** not the one that maintained they knew exactly what the law was here (despite being woefully wrong on multiple claims), only that I would not be at all surprised if there was a legal case to make, given the widespread laws, treaties and financial agreements this country is a signatory to.  People have tried suing the government for lots of things, successful or not - the most similar case I can think of are things like breach of contract lawsuits for state employees.  Do you really still maintain that you know there are no possible legal mechanisms under which the government can be held to their stated obligations?  Or are you still assuming we'll shred all our international obligations, laws etc to make sure they're not in conflict with your idioitic idea?

&gt;National Insurance isn't a savings account and doesn't pay interest

And this has what relevance?  As I said, this is to point out the irrelevance of your ""Getting more out than you put in"" point.  That's simply not grounds for dismissing those obligations, or considering it ""free money"".  If it were, you'd have to conclude savings accounts or other investments were examples of ""free money"".  They're simply not - you have to pay the cost of not having that money available earlier.  If it were free, confiscating that investment as you are advocating would mean they wouldn't lose anything - that's what ""free"" means - without cost.

&gt;It's s tax and a benefit like any other.

Tell me why, if it's identical, it's not raised from income taxes, but via a seperate levy with a stated purpose, and (theoretically) ringfenced seperate fund (albeit one the government borrows from).  It has always been deliberately structured as seperate from other tax income, like it or not.  You can't wish that away just because you don't like it.

And while you're at it, perhaps you could try once again to give a single reason why any of this is remotely a good idea given all the problems with it, compared to just taxing the rich generally, rather than just the old rich people, while setting a *terrible* precedent of violating longstanding agreements without refunding the money taken under false pretences.",null,0,null,1425332303,null,0,false,0,cp28jow,null,t3_2xcgtz,null,t1_cp28jow,null,t1_cp279os,null,null,null,1427542824,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Why raise taxes to fund an unnecessary benefit when we can just cut it to begin with.

Gotcha. Didn't think you were but the language could have taken it either way, so best to clear it up!

&gt; I'm not suggesting a conspiracy. 

No I was speaking of the broader conversation, rather than picking at your thoughts.

&gt; I think it does say something that the only people who openly talked about Muslim rape gangs a few years back were from the far-right

The problem with that is that it's what they would do, if you see what I mean? Mind you then that plays into the dismissal of such groups because of what they are seen to generally stand for. In that sense, it may be their own fault given the history of the various groups. Then you can wander down the ""Are they also concerned with rape in general or just this/these groups?"" That might be a wider issue though. You'll notice I'm justifying ignoring right-wing groups. Stopped clock syndrome!?

I'd like to think that ""decent middle class people"" wouldn't ignore child rape if they had the kind of proof that others had. Then again maybe there was no clear proof among many people but they took to talking about it because they had an ax to grind, as above?

Then again there were the people involved in supporting the victims for years who weren't listened to. I have to wonder how/why they didn't go to the media when the police etc. said ""meh"". Mind you I suppose they might have but it wasn't reported? By the way that's not to lay any blame at the feet of the support groups or victims - not in any way.

&gt;You can argue all you like this was a long standing agreement. It isn't. 

So, those government pages that state what pension given particular NI payments don't exist?

&gt;It'd save money that we could divert to people in genuine need

So would raising taxes.  And it'd do it without unfairly victimising the old (ie. why is it good that a 60 year old millionaire get penalised more than a 30 year old millionaire?), without creating a terrible precedent of failing to abide by stated agreements, and without the extra costs of the bureaucracy required for this means testing.  You've still not presented a single reason why this approach is **better**, and I've presented many that show why it's worse.  ""It'll raise money we need"" is not a good reason to do it one way if there are better, less destructive ways to accomplish the same goal.

&gt;Why do you think it's acceptable to cut housing benefit but not state pensions?

Because housing benefits aren't something the government has created a seperate fund for, stated how it would be used, charged people explicitly for on that basis, and thus stated up front what it would provide.

John Terry also advocated for gender equality in football when the chelsea ladies didn't have enough money to compete on the level with other clubs in their league he became a partner and gave a bunch of money to keep them going. 

Didier Drogba is another charitable player. Working very hard to make a difference not only in his own ivory coast but across a broad range of problems in a lot of different places in Africa. 

I'm sure other players do similar things just mentioning as they are legends of the club.   

Or direct him to the chelsea Foundation, where they use their influence and the game itself to accomplish a lot of things. [employment, education, social deprivation, crime reduction, youth offending and much more](http://www.chelseafc.com/the-club/foundation.html). Soccer is often used in areas that are hard to grow up in because all you need is a ball. If a kid is more interested in how many times they can keep up the ball than the mess of other things kids in bad areas can get into it's a wonderful thing, and chelsea works to foster this. 

They also do match day collections that the fans can vote which charity it goes to online, so a broad range of charities are supported by the fans. 

Honestly I agree about churches and politics being things where bad acts happen on a large scale by the very nature of the influence of Bad moral compasses, largely unchecked.

 But soccer as a group is focused on one thing, love of the game. The people we follow are players and coaches, who are held accountable by the fans is they go awry.  Are their bad apples in every group? ALWAYS. But in general sport is not something that can be twisted into something evil, pure sport it two teams of 11 people trying to win games for themselves and for their fans.

Everyone's currently bemoaning our defence, but the thing is they are being hung out to dry by our midfield. The man marking against Barca dragged Milner and Fernando all over the place which opened up huge holes to exploit, and we just cannot afford to have wide/attacking midfielders who do not get compact and put in a defensive shift, especially as Toure's not always tracking. When we used to play with Tevez as a second striker he would drop deep but you just don't get that with Aguero and Dzeko. Put all this together and you get situations where we are over-run and panicking. The space between our midfield and defence is currently a ripe hunting ground for opposition playmakers and it's forcing the likes of Kompany and Mangala to step forward into challenges they shouldn't have to make.

The distinction you are looking for, and I suspect the distinction the population voiced this survey based on, is mild vs. aggressive tax avoidance. Mild being ISAs etc., investment schemes etc. being aggressive. The distinction people want to make is that when average people avoid tax through ISAs its ok, because the gains are minimal and HMRCs loss is minimal. But when a millionaire avoids tax via Luxembourg, the loss to HMRC is seven figures long. And in a time when inequality is rising and the population at large is struggling, that's a problem.

What about the digital content that supports or is tied in with certain TV shows (not just talking about show sites, which are basically advertising and promotional and would be free to access, but things like the Dr Who games and such). Should they be behind a paywall for the TV Subscribers?


So you now need a unified subscription system which allows TV subscribers into the relevant web properties.

It's not as easy as just saying ""Well look at how Sky do TV subscriptions, and how the FT do online news paywalls"".

Same goes with Radio shows and integrated web content, podcasts, etc.

You're going to have BBC Online, Online(TV), and Online(Radio).

And of course we ignore things like 500 Words which is educational. The BBC does produce substantial educational material as a public service. If you want to go over to a subscription model then that is basically all going to go, or else schools are going to have to subscribe to their educational services division for TV and Online...

Where does Bytesize go to? Will you need to be a subscriber to BBC Online to access it?

I'm not saying it couldn't be done, but the BBC is the way it is because aside from the TV license, it's all free to access (or tune into), for everyone. This has led to their TV, Radio and Online services becoming uncommonly tightly integrated.

If you want to carve it out into separate subscription modules and business division then it will change the face of the BBC and how the divisions work and interact with each other - and I'm not entirely convinced it will be for the better.",null,0,null,1425336127,null,0,1425336547,0,cp2awcl,null,t3_2xoahi,null,t1_cp2awcl,null,t1_cp27ui5,null,null,null,1427543922,null,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1,null

Generally people join gangs for a sense of recognition, identity, family and brotherhood (to name a few), so surely supporting a football team for example prevents the need for people to actually join gangs.

It's actually pretty amazing how Kane can often create space for himself, because he sure as hell isn't getting much help form his teammates.  His first goal in the New Year's win against Chelsea was amazing in that regard... he just did it all himself.

Kane is clever with his positioning and tricky to mark, and so he needs a maelstrom of movement and activity immediately behind him to draw CDMs and CBs out of position.  We just don't play like that.

Because we for some reason keep playing inverted wingers, everyone just drifts into the middle and stands on the ball, waiting for someone else to do something.  We don't get nearly enough overlapping runs from our CMs, and our fullbacks aren't good enough in attack to provide width all by themselves (Walker is actually pretty decent at it, but his crossing and our lack or proper crossing targets makes him far less effective than he should be).

We definitely can't keep relying on Kane to drag us into games by himself.  I honestly would actually like to see us try a 4-4-1-1, with Soldado just behind Kane, as opposed to the other way around.

The big problem, and I'm not sure this will be a popular view, is politicians, the media and the public. CfH would have eventually succeeded, it needed two things, a strong department of Health to tell the trusts to put up and shut up about the new system and time and space out of the public eye to sort things out. Unfortunately the NHS is the publics sacred cow and that was never going to be allowed to happen. The first hint of failure is set upon my the media and the opposition who demand 'action' and unfortunately the answer 'the same people will continue working quietly and methodically to fix it' isn't as sexy at PMQ's as ""we will fire everyone involved, hold a huge public enquiry and make sure they never work for the government again"".

The NHS is great as a concept but to say that it doesn't have massive structural problems is delusional. Unfortunately the public regard it as so sacred the political debate on the subject extends only as far as an argument about who will throw more money at it. With that in mind I have come to the conclusion that it is just too big to be centrally managed, because to do so would require an iron fist for which there is no political will. And on that basis I think the CCG system is a good one.

As for wider issues about any large public project I think there should be less focus on screwing the private company down to the lowest possible price and more on deliverability and value. I think that they should have tightly defined scopes which as far as possible should be completely free from meddling as the project continues. And that they should be managed by experienced project managers (either contractors or recruited into the civil service) with as little involvement from politicians as possible.

Villa take on West Bromwich Albion at home on Tuesday night in the first of two derbies in four days — they also face them in an FA quarter-final on Saturday — with new manager Sherwood seeking to end a run of seven successive Barclays Premier League defeats.

The former Tottenham boss has overseen the last two of those — at home to Stoke and away to Newcastle on Saturday — but a point on Tuesday would see Villa climb out of the relegation zone as fellow strugglers QPR and Burnley are not in action until Wednesday.

While Sherwood does not see this week as make-or-break for Villa — ‘there’s still enough points to get out of trouble’ — he is adamant that survival this season will provide him with a platform to start rebuilding the club.

‘I’m only thinking about tomorrow (Tuesday) night,’ he said. ‘Win that, we’ll be out the relegation zone and we won’t look back.
‘The reality is we’ve got an opportunity to get ourselves out of it.

‘If we can, we will never be in this situation again because I will have the opportunity to build something and I won’t let that happen again.

‘I think there is enough to work with over a long period. I’m just hoping I’ve got enough time here to save the situation.’

Your only remaining option that hasn't been mentioned is probably Couch Surfing, lots of people enjoy it though I've never tried it

I'm a fair Airbnb user.. my only advice is to use the Contact host button and explain a wee bit about yourself, sound friendly, and a wee bit about why you're visiting. Doesn't hurt to mention you're friendly and like meeting new people. The problem with the ""Request to book"" button is it reserves the cash off your card immediately, even if the host doesn't accept the booking. When you mail a host from the listing page you arrived at from the search results, they still have the option to accept your booking anyway.

Also helps to contact 5/6 hosts at a time, to ensure at least one of them lines up and says yes, especially if your schedule is tight. Also check the listing page for the host's response rate. Some of them take days to reply, some of them hardly ever reply at all.

So it costs a fair bit to set up wind turbines offshore, and to maintain them. It's a lot cheaper to import natural gas or coal and burn it in power plants for energy. Government subsidies can keep renewables and nuclear competitive with other sources of energy on the market. 

You also have to think about the supply of energy. When there's wind it's great but if it's a still day it's hard to keep up with energy demand.

null,false,Erasmus_Microman,null,null,null,"&gt; &gt;     Online: this is the easiest case - there are already plenty of subscription websites out there.
&gt; 
&gt; But I'm not sure how easy it would be to carve out.
&gt; 
&gt; Sure, You could put online BBC Sport and News behind a paywall. But you can't do that with the whole BBC website.

Well, you *could*. There's little to no technical barrier there. 

&gt; What about the digital content that supports or is tied in with certain TV shows (not just talking about show sites, which are basically advertising and promotional and would be free to access), but things like the Dr Who games and such.
&gt; 
&gt; Should they be behind a paywall for the TV Subscribers?

Well, the simplest model is that you have open content, which is content that is predominently only of use to subscribers (eg TV listings) or which primarily serves to advertise subscription content (eg typical show micro-sites), and closed content which you consider to be the meat of the value that people subscribe for (eg TV programmes). I'm not sure which category you'd want to put the games you mention in as I'm not familiar with the content, and I admit there may be grey areas, but these are only the same questions that many other media companies are dealing with every day, so I can't really see it being a problem.

You can imagine more complex models with subscriptions/pay-per-view for particular content, but the example above would be closest to the existing model.

&gt; So you now need a unified subscription system which allows TV subscribers into the relevant web properties.
&gt; 
&gt; It's not as easy as just saying ""Well look at how Sky do TV subscriptions, and how the FT do online news paywalls"".

This sort of integration is actually the (fairly) easy bit, because on the web side you're dealing with your own systems and have a lot of control and flexibility over how they work (it's all just easily-updated software). This is the sort of stuff I do professionally and have in fact done for the BBC. The harder bits (though still quite feasible nowadays) are on the broadcast side, because that involves working with manufacturers, other broadcasters, etc, to agree on standards. Of course, some might argue that the BBC's resistance to technology that might make moving the BBC to a subscription model easier has been a significant part of the problem in the past (*ahem* Project Canvas *ahem*).

&gt; Same goes with Radio shows and integrated web content, podcasts, etc.

Same applies. If the BBC would like to remain close to its current model, then a single subscribed/not subscribed should fit that quite well, and if their appeal is as universal as they think, it would probably lead to a rise in revenue.

&gt; And of course we ignore things like 500 Words which is educational. The BBC does produce substantial educational material as a public service. If you want to go over to a subscription model then that is basically all going to go, or else schools are going to have to subscribe to their educational services division for TV and Online...

If it's of genuine educational value, fund it out of general taxation like any number of other educational project. The government already funds organisations to do this sort of thing with grants. (I know that an element of Council Tax goes to local schools, but I'd argue against that too - education should not depend on post code.)

&gt; I'm not saying it couldn't be done, but the BBC is the way it is, because aside from the TV license, it's all free to access (or tune into), for everyone. This has led to their TV, Radio and Online services becoming uncommonly tightly integrated.

This is a smaller problem (essentially a subset of) the one the BBC already deals with regarding its Worldwide output (access to paid content, and also ensuring UK viewers do not have access to content containing adverts, for legal reasons). 

&gt; If you want to carve it out into separate subscription modules, it will change the face of the BBC and how the divisions work and deal with each other - and I'm not entirely convinced it will be for the better.

Having been on the inside, it's difficult to see how it could be much worse! (Seriously, I've had a number of large, bureaucratic and internally political employers - including a couple of other ""biggest X in the world""s - but they don't come close.)

But if they go with a simple all-or-nothing subscription, I don't see why it should change things much.

&gt;Legislation will be introduced in Finance Bill 2015 to establish a new tax – the “diverted profits tax”. The tax will be at a rate of 25 per cent of diverted profits relating to UK activity. The charge will arise if either of two rules applies.

and

&gt;This measure will introduce a new tax on diverted profits. The diverted profits tax will operate through two basic rules. The first rule counteracts arrangements by which foreign companies exploit the permanent establishment rules. The second rule prevents companies from creating tax advantages by using transactions or entities that lack economic substance.

&gt;The main objective of the diverted profits tax is to counteract contrived arrangements used by large groups (typically multinational enterprises) that result in the erosion of the UK tax base.

14 What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save them? 15 Suppose a brother or a sister is without clothes and daily food. 16 If one of you says to them, “Go in peace; keep warm and well fed,” but does nothing about their physical needs, what good is it? 17 In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.

18 But someone will say, “You have faith; I have deeds.”

Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by my deeds. 19 You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that—and shudder.

20 You foolish person, do you want evidence that faith without deeds is useless[d]? 21 Was not our father Abraham considered righteous for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar? 22 You see that his faith and his actions were working together, and his faith was made complete by what he did. 23 And the scripture was fulfilled that says, “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness,”[e] and he was called God’s friend. 24 You see that a person is considered righteous by what they do and not by faith alone.

The Scotsman in this case is not guilty of the NTS fallacy.  The Indonesian guy genuinely wasn't scottish, he never changed his definition partway through the argument.

Markovic becomes a real star, and the shirt sales alone covers the periodic interest payments on that debt. Then, just before we have to pay back the principal amount, ie the debt we took up initially (this assumes that we pay the entire principal in a balloon at the end, and not partially over time), we sell Markovic for X amount more than the debt we now have to pay back, then that was good debt in and of itself. We payed the interest through shirt sales we wouldn't otherwise have gotten (an assumption just for the argument) and we covered the debt through the sale. The X amount above the debt in the sale is pure profit, and what makes that debt good. 

Then you have alternative cost to fuck everything I said above up a bit, but I won't get into that :)

What's so funny about United is that the Glazers bought United with very expensive debt (between 8-16% interest rate in different periods of time) and then piled that debt onto the  club through securing the debt against the club's assets. Even though they have payed down alot of loans and aren't really in economic crisis anymore an insane amount of money the club generated has gone towards paying interest and principal just piled on them by an external source. That's money that could otherwise be spent on signing players like Real Madrid are. Their bad debt is a very important factor in sinking the United ship.

What would you say he has excelled at as owner of RedSox, and what has he made mistakes in?

For me as an LFC supporter I am of the impression he and the other stakeholders are still learning about the sport of 'soccer', and the nuances of running a soccer club. Players transfers definitely seems to still be a tough subject for them. 

For what it's worth I personally believe a large number of LFC supporters will be eternally grateful to JH &amp; Co for buying our club and removing the previous (very bad) owners. Especially if we can continue to challenge at the sharp end.

null,false,Firefox7275,null,null,null,"Have you checked out our ingredients Wiki and sidebar, both the fledgling beginners' guide and the mega review topics? Ingredients to consider include niacinamide, sodium ascorbyl phosphate and a retinoid.

Have you consulted your family doctor about the acne or excess sebum production? 4% niacinamide/ nicotinamide would be one option (Nicam = pharmacy purchase or on prescription) and/ or a retinoid like adapalene (Differin, prescription only, but there are cosmetic retinoids).

IMO switch out your Biore cleanser for something gentler like the [Boots Simply Sensitive wash gel] (http://www.boots.com/en/Boots-Simply-Sensitive-Cleansing-Wash-Gel-150ml_1189221/) or the [Simple Kind to Skin refreshing wash gel.] (http://www.superdrug.com/Simple/Simple-Refreshing-Facial-Wash-Gel-150ml/p/949396) Irritation and dehydration can increase sebum output as the skin desperately tries to protect itself. That product contains SLES which is pretty harsh for twice daily use.

Another option for morning is to swipe the face with toner on a cotton pad, use a couple if you feel one is not enough to remove excess sebum. Several here like the [Simple KTS soothing toner] (http://www.superdrug.com/Simple/Simple-Soothing-Toner-200ml/p/949347#.VPUGuXysWSo) which is gentle and well priced.

Sunscreen I cannot suggest a specific product (hopefully someone else will) but look for one based on zinc oxide which is naturally antibacterial. If you cannot find something suitable with zinc there is the [Simple KTS protecting moisture cream SPF 30.] (http://www.boots.com/en/Simple-Kind-to-Skin-Protecting-Moisture-Cream-SPF30-UVA-UVB-50ml_1392663/) It is chemical so won't benefit the acne, but a couple of the regulars rate it for moisturising power and generally being nice to use. Should work well alongside a prescription acne product.

Superdrug have testers for the Simple sunscreen if you want to try a bit on the back of your hand. Whilst you are there, one of the moderators here /u/stufstuf/ sometimes struggles with breakouts but is loving the [Superdrug Simply Pure hydrating serum] (http://www.superdrug.com/Skin/Face/Serums/Superdrug-Simply-Pure-Hydrating-Serum-50ml/p/342700). 

Lastly are you consistently meeting or exceeding ALL our government's recommendations for healthy eating and lifestyle?

I'm kinda sick of Poch's 4-2-3-1.  I don't think it particularly suits us.  Playing inverted wingers all the time (like AVB did, and didn't he get a lot of stick for that!) just doesn't serve us well.  We can't play the kind of intricate one-touch passing that a dense, closely packed midfield needs, and so so we need to do more with incisive movement and stretching the play.

I am skeptical that we have reached (or will ever reach) a stage where we can say with certainty what is or isn't 'hate speech' - i.e. speech so obviously harmful that we know it should be banned.

Firstly - there is the uncanny problem that in the past, no matter how hard we tried to define what is self-evidently bad speech, history has shown we have later turned out to be wrong.

And then there is the fact that there's no definition of wrong speech that cannot be misused by people with poor or malicious judgement to punish their enemies or speech they disagree with.  (In fact, we see this all the time on the internet.  Twitter for instance might want to ban hate speech, but nobody can agree what that is, and as soon as they try to establish a rule, it immediately gets misused for power games or as a way to punish opponents.)

Edit:  Finally, there's the problem that banning speech doesn't in any case work to reduce hate.

That's something we take pride in, but you still need the players to have belief in what they're doing and how they're working.

- The first leg of Fiorentina we could and should have crushed them, if we had been more ruthless in finishing before they changed tactics and sat back to defend. Second leg would have been 100% different if Soldado hadn't bottled it.

- Chelsea, if we didn't look like winning, we didn't especially look like losing either. They were better, but things fell badly for us. I'm under no illusions that we should be near their level anyway.

- West Ham was not great. That worried me too. But we did step up - even though the two final goals were pretty flukey, we created a ridiculous amount of good chances in chasing that game.

null,false,Popeychops,lfc99,,null,"I wouldn't want to call anyone ""Dead weight"", which suggests they make no contribution, but there are quite a few players whose contribution I think cannot be considered good enough for squad players.

Starting with the obvious:

* Johnson

* Coates

* Ilori

* Aspas (Although we do really like him)

* Edit: Brad Jones, Lloyd Jones the young defender is only 19

* Alberto

All of the above are either on loan or nowhere near the first team.

The following I think will be controversial, but it would benefit player and club if they moved on:

* Yesil - He's obviously not going to get into the first team. The poor guy got an awful injury last January which obviously hurt his development, but other players at his age are breaking into the starting XI (Sterling, Ibe, Can, Markovic, Flanagan).

* Borini - Lambert is probably on similar wages, but no club will want to buy him. Borini isn't getting games. He's not going to improve to displace any of our first strikers. I expect Origi will take his place as backup striker next season. It's time to move him on, if we can get £10m for him we'd do well.

* Enrique - Bless him, I'm sure he's great for morale and obviously gets on well with the lads. Like Yesil, an injury has basically ruined his career with us. I don't think we can afford to pay wages for a player of his age who isn't starting. We need to offload him and secure another fullback, since Flanno can play LB and RB well enough, Ibe, Moreno and Marko can all play various wing-back roles, etc.

* Manquillo - We might lose him in the summer, or we might not. Either way he hasn't set the world on fire coming here. I think we loaned him to get cover for cheap, which was smart. Best case for us is that Atlético buy him out of the loan. Whether we have him next year or not, I think we need to buy a right-back of first-team quality.

I was mainly drawn by the club's history and, of course, Stevie G. How can you not love a man who is so identified with one single team? A talisman. Gives you shivers.

Now I'm setting the alarm to 7 AM on the weekends--much to my wife's chagrin--to watch BPL matches, and, of course my REDS.

Being a New Englander (besides parts of CT) is identification with the Red Sox. I imagine in some ways it's how people in England support their local football teams.

Generally JH and Co. for the Red Sox have been proactive in building from down to up - i.e. finding prospects to build the 'farm system' (equivalent of the academy). They have splurged on players in the past and especially this past off season, but for the most parts they try to find players who are the 'best bang for the buck'. 

In general, I'd say what JH is doing with Liverpool is very similar to what he does with the Red Sox - try to make a self sustainable club and supplement with 'smart buys' (ie never splurging). We keep seeing these threads about our average age - that's what JH is aiming for. Smart buys means we'll never be splurging on a big names like di Maria. They'd be looking to get someone like Lacazette etc. 

As both a Red Sox and Liverpool supporter (FSG having brought me here) it is quite uncanny how many similarities there are:
Arch rivals: biggest (Yankees) and one of the biggest (Man U) reputations in their respective sports. Both also spend crazy amounts of money on players and are geographic rivals too 
Stadiums: one of the oldest in their respective sports, rich with history
Before Henry bought: rich history, current decline

People get comfortable with each other, and they start perpetuating some of the fucked up shit that they believe in. You have to understand though, that though some of these negative beliefs are sometimes displayed in these situations, they aren't born there.  These racist, homophobic, intolerant behaviors are born when people are raised in the wrong households, in the wrong communities.

When we come together out of shared passion or belief we get to create something that transcends our differences. I'm a Chelsea fan. My brother, my comrade is not that person who shared my skin tone, gender or sexual orientation, it's that other Chelsea fan whom I may otherwise have nothing in common with.

Sometimes when we gather together to support this club we love so much, the ugly realities of the world we live in are revealed. But every single time we gather together to support this great club, we all get a little bit closer. You, myself, several thousand redditor and millions of people of different gender, sexual orientation from all over the world... we all get a little bit closer.

Don't let your articulate fried ruin this for you. Being part of Chelsea is a great thing.

People seem to forget that the high level of football at which we play is an arms race and this summer we had our purchasing power taken away by some cunt in an office in Switzerland. If we're mad about **potentially** not retaining the title we should direct our anger at them and their arbitrary bullshit rules which were designed to prevent clubs who come into large amounts of funding (like us) from being able to compete with the ""Big Boys"" in European football. We beat Chelsea and Liverpool last year. This year we returned practically the same team with the addition of one defender and one defensive midfielder. Everyone else in The Premier League was able to retool and build, while we were left with pretty much what we had. The fact that we're second right now is a testament to how good Pellegrini is and how good our squad was last year. 

Chelsea was lucky in that they got the ambitious billionaire owner a decade before we did so they were able to join the ranks of elites before UEFA felt pressure from the big money clubs to clamp down on that sort of thing. That's why they aren't in the same boat as us. Look at PSG. They had the same sanctions we had and they are in a fight at 2nd in a much lighter league. We need to stop blaming Pellegrini.

Bitbargain, bittylicious and Localbitcoins are marketplaces for individual sellers to compete on price.

Localbitcoins is the largest one of the 3, but has the greatest variety of slightly dodgy individuals ;)

Quickbitcoin, spectrocoin and Coincut are companies that do the same as above, but our UPS if you want to call it that is that you'll generally be able to ask more questions and you should expect an improved customer relationship. Probably ideal if you're new to bitcoins and need advice or would like consistency when dealing with a seller. 

Bitcoin exchanges will probably have lower prices for customers, but you'll need a greater understanding of markets in general to get started. It will usually also take a bit longer to transfer funds to exchanges before you can make a purchase due to UK banks being unfriendly towards Bitcoin companies for now - so you'll most likely be transferring your money outside of the UK before gaining access to 'instant purchases'. 

If you're thinking of acting 'as a regular seller', you're probably looking at the first 3. In the event that you choose to use large exchanges - just be a little wary of keeping large sums of coins there. Historically, it's been more prudent to keep your coins either offline, or in multi-sig capable wallets.

Hope that helps a bit more.

null,false,strolls,null,null,null,"&gt;  Someone commits an offence if their behaviour causes someone harassment alarm and or distress. A magistrate or jury could hear arguments for both sides and decide if a person committed an offence.

The problem with this is what already happens with public order offences - cops know they can lie in their testimony, and magistrates and juries will believe them. I would think you'll find acquittals to be very rare for public order offences. I think you'll find magistrates see their job as *""well, the policeman said you were naughty, so I have to punish you.""*

Tax inspectors wouldn't need to lie if we were to give them sweeping and unilateral powers, but they would still overuse them, and (genuine hard-working) people would end up feeling cheated. 

This is pretty much the situation at the moment, where they can tell a local plumber, ""you've not been declaring all your earnings"" and there's basically nothing he can do about it, whereas a multinational has the resources to drag them through the courts, appealing the claim.

I have no idea how much HMRC are stitching up local tradesmen in this way, but I know it certainly does happen occasionally. 

Although I can't say how true it is, I've heard the Italian and Greek propensities for tax-dodging are a response to how byzantine and bureaucratic their tax systems are - people think ""if I declare all of this, then they'll leave me nothing left for myself - hiding this from the taxman is the only way to be fair"".

The problem is not, at present, that the tax man does not have enough latitude or discretion, it's that our government doesn't really want to clamp down on offshore tax avoidance.

The traditional tory attitude is anti-tax, because their party membership is composed of those who are well off to afford private schooling for their kids, and they see less benefit from social welfare. 

(The historical socialist attitude towards tax is that it serves to redistribute wealth away from the aristocracy and, in helping those in need, it helps make our society more equal and fair. Unfortunately this narrative has fallen to the idea that we live in a democracy and that we're all born equal.)

There's no chance of us clamping down on tax avoidance at present, because we have a tory government - Cameron and Osborne both have multimillion pound porfilios which were stashed in offshore tax havens before they even inherited them.

Meanwhile, it *is* difficult to tax the rich in a global economy - there may now be more of an appetite for it now, under austerity - and Labour lost their way to neoliberalism.",null,0,null,1425357824,null,0,false,0,cp2mukm,null,t3_2xoegm,null,t1_cp2mukm,null,t1_cp2d2ek,null,null,null,1427549597,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

I was agency back then and it was a commission job, x amount of packages equals x rate of pay, under x deliveries and you had problems where the cost of van hire, fuel, running costs exceed daily rate of pay. Wasn't happy that I left some expensive items in vulnerable places but in the time that I worked for them, I only had two complaints... one of which was a customer who couldn't read my writing and couldn't find his package. 

When it was HDL, it was bottom tier stuff, even the royal mail would have forwarded on items because of specific council estates that it didn't want to deliver to (I'm looking at you... Weston Super-Mare).

If I'm a mechanic, and I buy 5 litres of oil from Halfords, then I'm allowed to treat that as a business expense.

What I'm not allowed to do is send my mum or my girlfriend to Halfords, have her buy the oil for £10 and sell it to me for £25, and have us split the tax obligation (so that we make £15 ""profit"" each, and thus come below the tax threshold or pay tax in a lower band).

If I were to try pulling that stunt, then I'm pretty sure HMRC would come down on me like a ton of bricks, yet we allow Starbucks UK to buy coffee beans and, more importantly, intellectual property, from their US parent company.

All we need to do is enshrine in law that anything a company buys from a parent company¹ is treated as profit, not as a legitimate business expense. I'm pretty sure Starbucks situation would sort itself out pretty quick if we did that.

If an American company wants to serve coffee over here, then that's fine. But if they sell a £2 cup of coffee and pay £1 for the beans, then they should pay tax on the £1 profit, not charge themselves £0.99p for the right to use their own logo and branding, and go on to claim that they only made a penny in profit.

Also, the first team is overloaded with strikers to the extent we could do with having a clearout this summer. That makes the chances of youth team players in that position getting a chance to be reduced. Maybe the plan is to send him out on loan and hope he does an Ibe.

We could just fucking forbid it.

Why pussy about?

Anything one buys from oneself should be treated as profit, and not a legitimate business expense.

If they want to deduct the cost of coffee beans as a business expense, they can buy them on the open market, from a 3rd party independent supplier.

I don't see why this is so hard.

I'm a mechanic, and if I buy a litre of oil, I'm allowed to charge it as a business expense. If I sent my girlfriend to Halfords and then had her sell me the litre of oil at a blatantly and grossly inflated price, so as to put me in a lower tax band, I doubt the HMRC would hesitate in redressing the balance.

null,false,Lucidious_89,null,null,null,"Another possible (wild) theory: Orson Pink is actually a future Doctor.

-He's a time traveler.

-The Doctor has already shown to take faces from people he's crossed paths with in his past.

-Orson is wearing the same orange space suit the Doctor has worn on several past occasions.

-He has the toy soldier ""heirloom"", which Clara leaves for the Doctor in the barn when he was a child. Leaving the toy to young Danny was merely to throw us off from making the Doctor-Orson connection, similar to how we're led to assume (at first) that the child in the barn scene is young Danny again.

-The Doctor - upon introducing Orson to Clara - says that the TARDIS brought him to Orson because ""he has something to do with your timeline"". We just assume that this means he's related to her, but no one ever explicitly says that has to be the case. The Doctor himself just assumes this. It could be ANYone related to Clara's timeline...and as the Impossible Girl, Clara is DEEPLY connected to the Doctor's timeline. The TARDIS brought the Doctor to someone connected to Clara: himself. This is further supported by the fact that the TARDIS brought Clara to the Doctor (as a child) when she tried to telepathically link to it a second time. The TARDIS is homing in on the Doctor, not Danny. It just doesn't seem to discriminate which version of the Doctor it homes in on. 

-Orson drops not-so-subtle hints that he's familiar with Clara, or feels connected to her in some way, despite having no way to have ever met her (if he isn't the Doctor). Again, this would make perfect sense if he's a future Doctor, as he would remember his past travels with Clara as 11 and 12.

-When the Doctor meets Orson, it's at the end of the universe. This just happens to be the exact place the Doctor can truly test his theories about the creatures that cannot be seen. Perhaps the Orson-Doctor is a version of the Doctor who is still obsessed with finding these creatures (thus why he's still holding onto the heirloom that Clara - aka the ""creature under the bed"" - left him), and traveled on his own to the edge of the universe to seek them out (which, in turn, lured the TARDIS and his past self to visit and seek the very same thing).


So to sum up: Orson Pink is a future iteration of the Doctor who travels to the end of the universe to seek the creatures that cannot be seen and hid under his bed as a child. However, due to timey wimey stuff, the 12th Doctor ends up traveling to the same location due to the TARDIS homing in on the Orson-Doctor after Clara leaves a trace of her telepathic link in the TARDIS. Not wanting to interfere with his own past, the Orson-Doctor plays dumb about his true identity, though not without heavily implying things to Clara.




Things that break this theory:

-The Orson-Doctor doesn't seem to have his own TARDIS. However, it may have somehow been left behind, and the Orson-Doctor really IS stranded at the end of the universe, waiting to be rescued by himself.

-The Doctor shows Clara news clips of Orson's first time travel, which is difficult to explain away if he really is a future Doctor.",null,0,null,1425365609,null,0,false,0,cp2pytf,null,t3_2xph8v,null,t1_cp2pytf,null,t3_2xph8v,null,null,null,1427551091,null,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2,null

* **1st**: *The Gunfighters*.  I know it has achieved some sort of pseudo-cult status among older fans but *god* that song is so annoying.
* **2nd**: *The Space Pirates*.  Comic relief characters play a prominent role in the plot.  Being American I cringe when I see the fake Southern accent.  Do Brits feel this way when American actors do a British accent?
* **3rd**: *The Time Monster*.  Plot is a mess.  Creates continuity errors for the explanation of Atlantis (re: The Underwater Menace).
* **4th**: *The Power of Kroll*.  The Kroll monster was not well realized.  Bad acting outside of the primary characters.  I actually like The Horns of Nimon - it's quite funny.
* **5th**: *Time-Flight*.  Why does the Master need to pretend to be an asian trope?  What does this accomplish?  A mess.
* **6th**: *The Twin Dilemma*.  Does anyone expect something different?  This one has it all.  The Doctor tries to strangle Peri, the plot makes no sense, the twins are awful, ugh.
* **7th**: *The Happiness Patrol*.  Just do a google search for ""The Kandyman.""
* **8th**: Err ... I guess the TV Movie?  It did kind of suck.  Half-Human?  Most fans just choose to ignore that one.
* **War**:  I really liked *The Day of the Doctor*.  Can't really criticize John Hurt ... although I wish Eccleston would have reprised the role.  The part makes more sense to me for the 9th Doctor.  I get that Hurt offered more widespread appeal to non-fans.
* **9th**: *Aliens of London / World War Three*.  I just can't handle the Slitheen.  They aren't funny.  The CG scenes where they unzip their heads are overdone.
* **10th**:  *Love &amp; Monsters*.  I feel kind of bad for the kid that came up with this episode concept.  It's a more or less universally reviled episode.  Crude sexual innuendos have no place on Dr. Who.
* **11th**:  *Victory of the Daleks*.  One only needs to point to how quickly the show ran away from the color coded Dalek design.
* **12th**:  *In The Forest of the Night*.  The Earth magically protects itself with super-evolving trees once every milennia or so?  Really?  Was the little girl supposed to be a tree or a forest pixie or something?

A lot of my choices easily could have gone in a different direction.
