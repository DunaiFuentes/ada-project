The class system has changed dramatically in the last century, to the point at which it is  bit useless in describing modern society. Working class people don't really exist, for example, in as much as their traditional industries became mechanised or discontinued. They either entered the increasingly nebulous middle class or fell into a cycle of benefits dependency. 

  It does however still define cultural identities. People are sometimes quite tribal about their class origins, a banker or dentist might consider themselves proudly 'working class' based on their upbringing. One salient demonstrator is accent, which becomes more regionally varied and non-standard at the working class end of the spectrum, and closer to RP at the other. 

  I personally found it quite beguiling going off to university and mixing with people from different class backgrounds, the norms and attitudes are markedly different. If there's anything particular you'd like to know feel free to ask.

He is a strange sort of luxury player.

I have to say, my knowledge of the Satanic Panic and related phenomena have made me incredibly cautious about a lot of the stories that have come out in the wake of Savile. I really think when you've got household names involved you have to be incredibly careful. David Icke's got people who'll go on the record saying that the Queen Mother raped them and drank their blood after transforming into a 12 foot tall reptile. I don't think that sort of things too ridiculous to bring up, considering that he's one of many conspiracists who've been sowing the idea of the 'elite paedophile network' for years. That's not to say that people who come forward with these reports should be considered deluded or disregarded (we've seen where that leads), but there should be a lot of caution, and particular attention should be paid to any psychologists or lawyers involved. In false memory cases, the person involved as the 'accuser' is essentially a victim of severe medical malpractice (if there was anyone medically qualified involved at all). The details of the police investigation also bear looking at. The late Richard Webster wrote a number of books and articles about the children's home investigations in the 90's, pointing out the problems with these sorts of investigations, and uncovering reports of some really shocking investigative tactics; police officers coaxing people into reporting historic abuse that they had never before talked about by discussing the compensation claims they could make, for example. One thing that has to be remembered about historic child abuse cases is that they often work backwards. Normally in a criminal case, police have evidence of a crime and try to discover who committed it. In historic child abuse cases, it's often the other way round; the police have a suspect, and are trying to develop evidence of crimes they have committed. It's very easy to see how this could lead to miscarriages of justice in some cases.

&gt; 
&gt; The first English involvement in Ireland took place in this period. In the summer of AD 684 an English expeditionary force sent by Northumbrian King Ecgfrith invaded Ireland. The English forces seized booty and several captives, but they apparently did not stay in Ireland for long. The next English involvement in Ireland occurred some 500 years later, when the Normans invaded in 1169.^[Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Ireland#Conquest_and_rebellion)

It is an absurdity to suggest that England, with it's fair share of Civil Wars competing kingdoms and kings was somehow more unified than Ireland.
&gt; 
&gt; During the settlement period the lands ruled by the incomers seem to have been fragmented into numerous tribal territories, but by the 7th century, when substantial evidence of the situation again becomes available, these had coalesced into roughly a dozen kingdoms including Northumbria, Mercia, Wessex, East Anglia, Essex, Kent and Sussex. Over the following centuries this process of political consolidation continued.[40] The 7th century saw a struggle for hegemony between Northumbria and Mercia, which in the 8th century gave way to Mercian preeminence.[41] In the early 9th century Mercia was displaced as the foremost kingdom by Wessex. Later in that century escalating attacks by the Danes culminated in the conquest of the north and east of England, overthrowing the kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia and East Anglia. Wessex under Alfred the Great was left as the only surviving English kingdom, and under his successors it steadily expanded at the expense of the kingdoms of the Danelaw. This brought about the political unification of England, first accomplished under Ãthelstan in 927 and definitively established after further conflicts by Eadred in 953. A fresh wave of Scandinavian attacks from the late 10th century ended with the conquest of this united kingdom by Sweyn Forkbeard in 1013 and again by his son Cnut in 1016, turning it into the centre of a short-lived North Sea empire that also included Denmark and Norway. However the native royal dynasty was restored with the accession of Edward the Confessor in 1042.^[Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England#Middle_Ages)

* He has an abysmal touch, which you dismiss as a valid criticism for no reason other than pure ignorance again.

* He's more mediocre than Balotelli. You dismiss this again as he's alright because he played okay for Guadalajara. Laughable, fucking laughable.

But as everyone else says this is the cheapest loan you will ever be able to take out in your life (except maybe very generous family or friends). If you have some big spend planned in the next 4 years then this is a very good source of income. After all this debt isn't like other debt and you will pay back tiny amounts. This I think is a very good trade off for financial independence.

Plus you might change your mind into moving out of your house one year with your friends. I did this myself, my first year of uni I lived at home but all the other years I lived away from home because I felt I was missing out on lots of uni life. In hindsight I wished I had moved out in my first year too. But the money I saved by living at home first year meant I could live very comfortably the 3 years I didn't live at home.

---

&gt;

&gt;Doughnut holes are small, bite-sized doughnuts that were traditionally made from the dough taken from the center of ring doughnuts. Before long, doughnut sellers saw the opportunity to market ""holes"" as a novelty and many chains offer their own variety, some with their own brand names such as ""Munchkins"" from [Dunkin' Donuts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunkin%27_Donuts) and ""Timbits"" from [Tim Hortons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Hortons).

&gt;Traditionally, doughnut holes are made by frying the dough removed from the center portion of the doughnut. Consequently, they are considerably smaller than a standard doughnut and tend to be spherical. Similar to standard doughnuts, doughnut holes may be topped with confections, such as glaze or powdered sugar.

&gt;Originally, most varieties of doughnut holes were derivatives of their ring doughnut (yeast-based dough or cake batter) counterparts. However, doughnut holes can also be made by dropping a small ball of dough into hot oil from a specially shaped nozzle or cutter.  This production method has allowed doughnut sellers to produce bite-sized versions of non-ring doughnuts, such as filled doughnuts, [fritters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritter) and [Dutchies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutchie_(doughnut\)).

*Not me, this is Patrick Vieira:*
&gt;VIEIRA ON BARRICADING THE DEFENCE
Shut out the oppositionâs attack by learning to defend as a team with this drill from the World Cup winner
âTo begin this drill set your team out as if you were lining up for kick-off. At Arsenal we played 4-4-2. The coach stands in the centre circle and positions four coaches on the sidelines â two on either side.
Then you have a coach stand in between the back four and the midfield. Once everyone is in position the coach in the centre circle (coach A) plays a pass to any one of the five other coaches. 
**If the ball goes out wide to coach F the team have to move across at speed to close the space down as a unit. Itâs important the players learn to cover one another.** 
Once the space has been shut down coach F plays the ball back to coach A, the team resets and they play another pass to a different coach. 

*From Michael Carrick:*
&gt;Know your job
**âIf youâre playing the holding role in a central three in midfield, youâre screening the two centre-halves and stopping the service getting to the oppositionâs forwards. If the game is being played at 100mph, donât get carried away with whatâs happening â positioning is the key.** If you can get on the ball and support the attack then go for it, but be aware of where the danger is if the move breaks down. If they counter-attack youâve got to be able to get in a position to help the defence.â

*More from Vieira:*
&gt;Use your football brain
âAs a defensive midfielder you must be tactically aware. Youâre at the heart of the team so you have to hold everything together and allow other players to express themselves. To do this you need to talk a lot and use your brain, because quite often you have to be in the right place at the right time. You have to cover the gap between the midfield and the back four, **cover the left and right full-backs when they go forward and the central defenders when they push further up the pitch.â** 



E: Point here being Lucas would be much better as a DMF in this position. And point being you are just not understanding the DMF role if you think he should remain central. An excellent DMF would be not where Mata was, but he would have cut that channel out long before the attack developed. You dont have to man mark your man each time. Just know where to be to intercept a ball that can open you up.

If you're like me and pale with pinky tones then you should try out pink toned foundations rather than neutral or yellow toned - neutral can wash you out and doesn't seem to cover redness in my experience, and yellow tones will look orangey and won't blend nicely because of this. 

In terms of skincare itself, maybe try the skincareaddictionUK subreddit (sorry no link - on mobile)

As for expanding your collection, I think real techniques brushes are a great start! Which ones have you ordered? 

Also perhaps for your birthday you could ask for a subscription to a beauty box? (glossybox etc) these come through your post and have a few new products every month, many full sized. It's a great way for a beginner to discover brands and items that you may not have seen/heard of before. Also take advantage of brands such as MUA in superdrug - lots of eyeshadows/eyeliners/lipsticks etc are only a pound so are great for trying out new colours or looks without spending a ton! 

I would try to avoid sleeping in makeup - but if you feel you must then the bb cream you mentioned could be a better alternative :) 

Also - try looking on instagram/reddit/pinterest for makeup looks that you like and checking the product list.

The original aim was to boost trade and make the members economies interdependent so as to make war between imposible. 

Nowadays it does a bit more than that  like harmonising  regulations so for example if you  make a widget and get it certified in the UK it's certified  in all 28 member  states and the three EEA states this is a massive  help for  companies wanting  to sell abroad. It also means  you  know what  you're  getting  because  the legal definition  of a product  is the same. Ie food has a given purity or a given grade of timber has X strength.  This has on ocasion  got a bit overzealous dictating  the shape of fruit and such.

Also stuff like vat is easier last year when I bought  some polish steel from a Dutch company based in Germany the only extra paperwork  I had to do was put NL before their VAT number the bank even handles the euro conversion painlessly because there aren't  28 curencies to deal with . That sort of thing was a real pain in the arse before the EU.

There is also the clout  that  comes with colective  bargaining.  An economy  of 500 million people can press for much better terms  than any member could get individualy.

I really am interested in who you think has ""flipped the chessboard"" over in our country. Only Farage is blatantly anti-EU, Cameron, Clegg and Milliband are all passionate EU lovers through and through.

You apparently criticise our leadership for not having bent over backwards to the EU enough. An attitude that in my humble opinion, is little more than boot licking. You talk about the unelected officials over here, but not a single word for all of the unelected people who run the EU and by extension, our own country. We have such little say in the upper echelons of the EU, it is quite a joke. 

&gt;About time we rein in the power of the financial sector

This is not the EU's job, nor its intention. The EU wants economic imperialism over military force. New century, new methods. It doesn't matter how the economic power is gained, even if it means mass migration that replaces the population. 

&gt;Time to learn some history get rid of this little englander view.

All my study of history has shown me is that this tiny island can conquer the entire world. This idea we've always been polite members of Europe and have accepted immigrants is the bizarre view to hold. We've always gunned for a disunited Europe and alliances of convenience.

null,false,kristianstupid,null,null,null,"Hiya, Australian here just moved to Edinburgh (for the second time in my life!) with my wife and 18month old.

Here are some quick responses to your questions from a fellow member of the Commonwealth.

* 1. zoopla and rightmove worked for us. We got a place pretty quickly each time we moved (within 2 weeks of arrival) though that isn't to say the market is easy. 
* 2. NHS is great. As you are from a fellow Commonwealth country, I'm 99% sure you'll have full access (as I do).
* 3. No idea. We worked and paid taxes and didn't feel destroyed by them. Watch Council Tax though, there are different bands and some are high!
* 4. No idea, but just join a bunch of temp agencies before you come over. You might even be able to secure a job before you arrive, which will help with the visa. Never had an issue with getting employment.
* 5. I find the culture to be great though quite different from back home (Sydney) I think the weather has something to do with it. With respect to racism - well I'm white so obvs safe in that respect. Edinburgh is a VERY white city for someone from a place like Sydney. But that doesn't mean it has a problem with racism.  As with most Western nations at the moment we're going through a period of escalating xenophobia and racism. Best thing to do is come and combat that :)
* 6. Visas - if you're under 30 you might be able to get a working holiday visa (which I did my first time round), or get a sponsered job before arriving (what my wife did this time around). That said I don't think you'll have much problem as there are some weird benefits to Commonwealth membership.",null,0,null,1427705323,null,0,false,0,cpvcvlk,null,t3_30d6nx,null,t1_cpvcvlk,null,t3_30d6nx,null,null,null,1432093635,null,1,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,1,null

null,false,WakingWoes,null,null,null,"The First and Second World Wars didn't really destroy the aristocracy in one fell swoop, they set in motion a series of chain events that led to the aristocracy being on it's knees today.

The decline of the aristocracy began during the industrial revolution when the economy shifted from agriculture to industry. Large swathes of land became a burden, which was worsened by the cheaper crops that were being imported from America. Since women could inherit in America, a good number of aristocrats took to marrying American heiresses.

Both World Wars saw a Labour government elected to rebuild the country. In order to fund their socialism, they taxed the aristocracy exorbitantly. They increased inheritance tax which is levied on how much you own in total. So if you have a large, historical home and a number of priceless artefacts and works of art but have very little money, your family are up the metaphorical creek when the government demands 80% of your worth after death.

Naturally this led to a great number of stately homes being destroyed, and since the government were essentially responsible for that they were obliged to found English Heritage, who will turn your house into a tourist attraction when they claim it for themselves. 

While the houses were disappearing, so were the people. Both World Wars [killed the aristocracy disproportionately](http://allpoetry.com/Aristocrats:--I-Think-I-Am-Becoming-A-God-). Whilst the middle class plumped for comfortable desk jobs behind the front lines, the working class and upper class were sent to fight in their name. As a result, a number of families had no living sons to take their titles. Families that had a continuous line from the Norman Conquest were suddenly snuffed out, and the homes they inhabited now litter the landscape in ruins. All very Ozymandias.

Is it not short-sighted to declare that one culture taking cues from another culture (if that is what is happening, I don't actually believe it is) is part of human existence?  For instance in the UK, we have to refer to the american 'snickers' instead of marathon bars, this is part of life.  I might like jazz music, should I stop myself listening to it to maintain some weird cultural purity?  What if a woman from India comes to the UK and wears sarees, if they stop doing so and wear jeans and a t-shirt, should we condemn them for appropriating our culture?  Or do they get a free pass because of a good stack of oppression points, and the white gays don't have enough?

When this 'problem' happens are the gay white men not acting like a character?  Is it not racist to assume that white gay men saying 'I'm a strong black woman' and shit is actually copying black women?  Is it not a racist assumption and an act of stereotyping itself that as a unit, black women act like this and their culture is like this?

Nowadays, people had to cut back, but you can't see it looking at the rich. So the discourse becomes quite anti wealth, which in turn leads the rich to develop a sort off ""victim complex"", in the sense that if you get attacked just for being rich, no matter what you do, you might as well not give a fuck.

You appear to have missed out your explanation of how demanding people of a certain skin colour to stop using certain behaviours while people of other skin colours can, isn't downright racism. Also, how demanding people of one gender to stop using behaviour that people of another gender can use, isn't downright sexism. You could also argue that it is homophobic because of the fact they specify that it is gay men who must not use this behaviour.

This NUS group is entirely hypocritical. They demand that people stop using behaviour because they are the wrong gender and colour, while claiming to fight for equality.

There's a culture in animal research of trying to minimise the harm caused, reduce the numbers of animals used, and to try to find alternative methods for research. Where this can't be done, the legislation attempts to ensure that no animal comes to any unnecessary harm. 

The fact is that often animal model systems are the only possible avenue of research. They are more relevant in different ways than human cell cultures. Because many model systems used reproduce quickly and often we can generate large research cohorts. We can do all sorts of genetics to make research possible. We can model diseases as they occur.

I think that breaking up England into maybe six or seven devolved regions, coherent cultural and socio-economic units, on a par with Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, would be a very good way of ending the economic domination of London that so much of th rest of th country suffers from.

Another obvious grouping would be devolving the four Yorkshire counties into a single regional power, with control of its own affairs. After all the Yorkshire economy is the same size as the Scottish economy.

I don't know how th rest of the country would/should be divided, but I know that the Wessex and Mercia movements have a long history.

And just as an aside, I'll also just say this. I'm a firm believer in devolution, but I don't support independence movements. For me devolution is about democracy, because it brings the state closer to the individual. It gives us a stronger hand in how things are run, and it decentralises the power in our nation. Nationalism and independence movements, however, I think are th opposite. If democracy is about engagement then separatist nationalism is a rejection of democracy, because its aim is to remove itself from a system rather than engage it.

---

The **Superdrug Simply Pure Hydrating Serum** has really helped me re-evaluate my skin. I know I bang on about it, but it is a nifty little product. Not just for what it does, but how it's helped me look at my skin.

So basically, I've been fighting hormonal acne around my mouth and last week I realised that SLS in my toothpaste has been playing a big role in that. With about four tubes of toothpaste in my house, I tried rinsing with a non SLS mouthwash to see if that helped. It did! But my face would dip in and out of clearing up and I realised, that while the serum made the rest of my face glow and the skin look super healthy, I would keep getting these horrible weird closed comedone patches on my forehead that would come and go throughout the day. I don't wash my hair daily, I keep it tied back, i change my pillow cases regularly ... it just wasn't adding up. 

I looked at my routine again, and I thought, if these acids are *really* doing work, it shouldn't be like this. Last week I dropped my acid use to about three times a week and the only thing I've been using daily is the **COSRX Natural BHA Skin Returning A-Sol** because it's mostly propolis. My skin has really responded to this. 

I'm so silly. I've been moving forward with how I thought my routine should look and not really properly taking a step back and looking at my skin to say, ""OKAY what do you *really* need?"" Progress is slow right now. I'm now of the impression that I was over exfoliating which lead to the closed comedones. I now feel a little guilty for blaming my **Mizon Snail Recovery Gel** for not agreeing with me. I might add it back into my routine to see if the snail goo soothes my skin. It works amazingly well as a spot treatment, I imagine that due to my over exfoliation it could only do so much!

1) Toast

2) Apiary (they have an amazing seafood platter for 2 that is 32 quid total and a ""3 birds, 3 Beasts"" platter for 34, good mid-priced wine options too)

3) Hewat's (the food is excellent, it has a cosy and romantic ambiance and the portions are big. They also have 2-3 course set meals. I recommend 2 courses each, you share a starter and a pudding)

4) Hanedan (Turkish food. No, not a kebab place)

5) Mother India (really, really good Indian food, served small plates style so you can share a few things)

6) The Dogs

I believe all of these places have menus online you can have a look at. Check opening times because some restaurants close on Monday.

null,false,mathilda420,null,null,null,"I've recently been using **Boots Time Delay Skin Brightening Toner** the odd evening as a AHA. Been around 3/4 weeks now. I like it. It's too drying to use every night so I've been going with every 2 days, depending on how my skin feels. It has definitely softened my skin and it looks a lot more radiant and youthful. (I'm 28 and though I look young for my age, this product has probably shaved another couple of years off. I could pass for 20 without makeup.) My pores have shrunk in size and my skin feels a lot less oily. I also use this as an exfoliant for my bikini line and on my back as I started developing acne a few months ago (moved 400 miles away) and it's definitely helping there.
I'm happy with this product, especially for the price. (Around 3 quid.) I'll use this until it runs out, but I probably won't repurchase as by then, it'll be closer to summer and I'll be looking for a gentler exfoliant. I'd recommend this to someone with oily skin on a budget / looking for something easy to find. 

I also bought **Simple KTS SpF30 Moisturising lotion** and have been using it for the last week. I'm enjoying it. It works (my skin has experienced 0 redness since using it) and again, is quite a nice price. It does go on very white and it takes a while to absorb properly into the skin; definitely leave at least an hour before applying makeup, but is not at all irritating and I haven't been breaking out with cystic acne which can happen when I use sunscreens.  I use 3/4 pump on my face and another 3/4 on my neck, chest and ears. I also use 1 pump on my hands. Again, I will use this until it runs out, when I will switch to an Asian suncream with higher SPF and lighter consistency. (I live in the south so will be getting a lot of sun in Summer. Having just moved down from Scotland, my skin will need even more sun protection!) 

**My skin** is oily and although it's not sensitive, it does not enjoy excessive fragarances etc. It can be prone to redness at times and I get a lot of hormonal acne around my chin at the moment, although I'm expecting that to setlle down at some point as I believe it's a reaction to having an IUS fitted. I'm in my late 20s but have been incredibly lucky with my genes and my skin looks early 20s. I have large pores on my cheeks and a few tiny (almost unnoticable) SFs on my nose. I like to be very gentle with my skin and I embrace the oilyness, prefering to replace with clean oils rather than strip them all away.

In the fallacy you mention - there are people who **have** to use British currency. It is not hypocrisy for them to aspire to something else but have to use what is. That's a given. Though I would point out to you that I've seen many a pound coin with RIRA stamped on it so at least some Republicans even agree with that fallacy. 

If you're going to be a fucking social justice warrior and put up a sign in your shop saying ""No Xians"" then you had better not allow in any of the symbology of that faith either. Because they are one and the same. That $20 note says in God we trust on it. Christians aren't allowed in the shop - why should a message of their god unless its being kept as some form of trophy against that faith. 

I would also state that a differing definition of hypocrisy is allowed. The image is a joke. I don't expect they are being that draconian, nor do I expect that they really can keep people who are Christians out. A secondary definition of hypocrisy is that one holds a pretense of having a desirable or publicly accessable view. 

This falls under that category too. So now that I've explained hypocrisy to you I expect some further rertardation on how your right and I'm wrong.

I genuinely don't know who gets my vote currently. I'm split three ways across the main parties.

Labour: like to think I'm a Labour voter at heart but finding it hard to justify it. I feel like if I voted for them I'd like them to be more left than they currently are. Plus I wouldn't trust Ed Balls with a chocolate biscuit. With social policy, I'm a Labour voter.

Conservatives: I feel like these haven't been as bad as I expected. Would the economy be in a better place under Labour? I'm not so sure it would. I feel they are the most competent party at the moment (but for our parties, that's not saying much). With economic policy, including benefits rate, I'm a Conservative voter.

Liberal Democrats: I think this is meant to be the party I vote for as they take the centre ground where I suppose I find myself. I also think Nick Clegg is more level headed than the media makes out. However, as I am to sit on more than Â£30,000 debt I don't know if I could forget about that betrayal at all.

""Preferably full of politically left leaning students""-Brighton is home to the University of Sussex and the University of Brighton. There are also hundreds of foreign schools and in the summer Brighton buzzes as you have a lot of domestic and foreign students in town. Brighton is also where the first ever Green Party MP was elected, so it's fair to say we're pretty left wing.

""Not full of racists or sexists""-Brighton has a reputation of being one of the most liberal parts of the U.K. To the best of my knowledge, racism and sexism aren't major issues here and Brighton has (unofficially) been dubbed the 'Gay Capital of Europe'. This openness really makes for a vibrant attitude and feeling around the city, particularily in the summer as we're right next to the beach. The summer nightlife here is excellent with plenty of beach side clubs and bars, and we also have 'The Lanes' which is full of cool and interesting things.

""Lots of history and culture""-History wise we're kinda limited, we do have the Brighton Pavilion, the Lanes, Brighton Pier and the worlds oldest electric railway and operating cinema but really that's it. Culture wise however we are exceptionally rich, with a lot of live performances, street art and general things that should float your boat.

""Into travel, environmental activism...hiking, camping, trail running, mountain biking and climbing""-Brighton is on the ""South Downs"" where you can do all of what you mentioned. It's astounding natural beauty and only 25 minutes out of town, it really sounds like your sort of place.

I lived at home when I went to University. Similar situation to you in a lot of respects: I'm keen to maximise the money I have, don't overindulge in much at all and so had very little to spend on 

I took the loans out. Maintenance and tuition fees. I'm in ""debt"" for about Â£30k ish. Why in quotes? Because its not a real debt. If I lose my job I stop paying it. No one comes knocking on my door trying to reclaim their losses or anything. 

The money can be put straight into a savings account or ISA if that's what you want to do with it or spend all of it if you want. 

You start paying it back when you are earning above Â£21k from the march after you graduated. If your salary drops below that threshold you stop paying it. 

The payment comes straight out of your paycheck, so you never actually have access to that money. For me its about Â£70 a month. 

On my current salary I am not going to pay it off within the 25-30 years (can't remember when it times out). By that time I'll hope to have gone up in salary anyway, but any outstanding debt 30years down the road is cancelled and never needed to pay it off. 

Its an extremely low interest loan, cheaper than you'll get ever. When I was at uni I had a Saturday job and the student loans. All of this went into savings accounts or ISAs. Right now I have been working for 2 years and already have plenty saved up for a mortgage deposit if I wanted. 

I didn't have a credit card until last year. I now use it constantly. But I use it to buy what I would with my debit card and pay it off every month, so my credit history is being built up. 

Debt isn't bad, high interest rates are what is. If you have your spending under control and don't get into unmanageable debt, then you will be fine. 

If none of this convinces you, I'd ask why you don't want the loans? Why not go straight to uni?",null,0,null,1427718730,null,0,false,0,cpvg0jf,null,t3_30sovv,null,t1_cpvg0jf,null,t1_cpvf8nd,null,null,null,1432095113,null,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1,null

While we are at it, amend the displinary procedures for the lower house. Only the electorate can sack their MP. A prison sentence for a serving MP should not be instant sacking.

No, the argument is that Trident being so close puts us at danger of a first strike, and it does - the aim of a first strike is always to prevent your enemy from being able to retaliate,  City's as targets are much further down the list of priorities.

Very many forms of dangerous driving are quite legal and seen as normal - whether it's driving blindly into other vehicles, people (including a lollypop man, complete with stick, on a zebra crossing) because of the sun, fog or just because you weren't looking, or more recently because you were reading text messages on your phone (You may get charged but no jury in the UK will find you guilty unless you're driving a lorry and caught deleting the texts).

So driving within ""The Law"" isn't good enough to be safe, and this reflects that in terms of liability.

First fail was in 2010 when I thought everything natural was the only way to go. My late gran and an aunt passed away from cancer in the previous 3 years. I did OCM and used all stuff *natural*. The result was the craziest dermatitis and breakout I've ever had in my life. Took me years to finally banish all the PIH.

Second fail was in 2012 when I completely destroy my skin moisture barrier due to overexfoliation. My face was tight, stinging, dry and I was still living in the Netherlands. I shed a tear coming out of the house and riding my bike. The wind's crazy in there and my skin condition made it too painful to bear.

Third fail was earlier this year! I thought my face is not that clog/acne-prone, so I thought I can finally simplify my products (so in here I thought ""my routine should be simple""). I used Holland &amp; Barrett Wonder Oil I have for my hair as cleansing oil and Fenjal Sensitive Body Lotion for my body on my face. My skin seemed fine for a few months, until I got the worst SD-flareup last January. My face was itchy and flaking like crazy, plus a few small itchy blisters between my eyes and eyebrows. When I retested the oil alone afterwards, I got a cyst.

Even now, I still devise my routine based on an ideal I have in mind: gentle cleansing and exfoliation, proper hydration and moisture barrier preservation, vitC/aox, retinoid, AHA and AzA (still on the lookout for the perfect ss). Luckily, this time it seems to be working fine.

This gives a good idea about how sites weigh up within the organisation. If you think about your top 5 (or 10) ""famous"" visitor sites and then look at that page of sites owned by the group, you'll quickly realise that there's a decent scope of sites that aren't covered on your famous list. 

The issue of ""importance"" is subjective as well. Factors of importance can range from ""how unique is this site"" ""how well research is this site"" ""this site isn't popular so can we really consider it important to our heritage?""  There are plenty of debates with no real right or wrong answers.

It'd be difficult to estimate how impact falls financially. Some of these sites may require very little staff or maintenance work, others will have hundreds of staff and maintenance bills running into hundreds of thousands (if not more), however these sites may also be the biggest tourist attractions (which doesn't necessarily negate the financial stress)

I apologise because I realise I'm giving a pretty vague response but my main point is that there are so many points of discussion and debate when it comes to heritage sites management and finance is thinly spread over a huge range of sites.

My educated guess would be sites that have a small visitor base but a high maintenance cost may be the first to fall. I think this would largely apply to ecclesiastical sites (medieval builders were ambitious!) Yes some Cathedrals are pretty popular but I reckon there may be some pretty unique churches tucked up in that list that don't get the recognition or visitor base they deserve.

There are ways around that - keeping proper books, and running it like a business makes it all different category, were you would be taxed on the profit, after expenses.

null,false,haloraptor,cnty-wales,Wales,null,"Well, at the university level all projects which would require a license go through the Home Office. They're vetted by internal ethics boards and have to clearly state their aims, what they hope to achieve, the severity of the research, and why that severity is justified. In addition to the project license required for a specific project an institution has to have an establishment license as well, and there are three kinds of license. Your license dictates what sorts of purposes animals can be used for. Cardiff University for example has all three kinds of license. 

Also, all vertebrates and cephalopods are considered protected animals in the UK. Only some of these are considered valid research animals, and there's legislation which dictates exactly how these animals may be used. It goes into things like how much blood you can take at any one time, and then over the course of a month. It says what method of culling should be used on different species of different weights. 

Many institutions are very open about the animal research they conduct. There's a culture of increasing openness about this sort of research because researchers understand that the public often doesn't understand why it's necessary, and sometimes the reasons can be difficult to communicate without being overly complex or too simplistic and lacking in details.

[Here is the UK government website dealing with UK research and testing on animals. It's very informative. It has lots of links to actual pieces of legislation and such. Should give an overview of what restrictions there are.](https://www.gov.uk/research-and-testing-using-animals) Scientists are required to catalogue every single procedure done on animals. Each year the number of animals used and the severity of procedures are collected and given to the Home Office. Everything is very tightly controlled and there's documentation relating to pretty much every facet of the research - health of the animals, genetic information, pedigrees, the researcher who carried out the procedures, the person responsible for the project overall etc. 

The '3 Rs' are very important in animal research - reduce, replace, or refine. The goal is to use fewer individual animals where possible, either by sharing animals between research groups (e.g. you get the heart, I get the liver, someone else gets the brain) or by carefully designing experiments to use only the minimum amount of animals required. We're very good at animal research in the UK. Our regulations are actually stricter and tighter than EU regulations.

null,false,twersx,null,null,null,"Unicameralism isn't uncommon at all in the modern world. The Nordic countries have unicameral legislatures and it's not like they are the living embodiment of Mad Max. 

Bicameral legislatures exist to represent different interests in the governing process. States and people, upper class/non upper class, etc. If the need to represent massively different strata disappears then we can get rid of the upper house and have legislature carried out by the single chamber. 

There are obviously problems, it can lead to a majority government being pretty much unstoppable, but that can be mediated quite well. For one, it relies on majority governments being formed; in a lot of parliamentary countries, Majority governments are extremely rare and coalitions the norm. That way, there are elements in the government who will not always agree with the decisions the Head of Government makes. Denmark hasn't had a single party in a majority government for over 100 years, and only 4 of their coalitions since 1945 have been majorities. A proportional representation system can be used to diversify the parties in parliament, and there are actually dozens of ways of allocating seats with PR. While we don't have all that many parties with mass appeal, with more a proportional voting system, the need for vaguely similar ideologies to coalesce into a single party is reduced. You get more minority parties and more people voting for them, and the all-or-nothing style of our system is gone. 

As an example, a classical liberal MP would have to join either the Lib Dems or the Conservatives to realistically have a chance of being in Parliament; he might get 5% of the vote in his constituency but tough shit, it doesn't matter. If classical liberalism candidates were polling nationally at 5%, then the classical liberals could leave the parties they have aligned with and form a small party. It wouldn't ever be a majority government, but it will have representation, the party can participate in government without sacrificing political ideals to toe the line of a larger party or appease the higher up social conservatives or social liberals in order to ensure they can run with party sponsorship again. 

No, right now just getting rid of the Lords and not changing anything else would be disastrous, but IMO we should be striving towards unicameralism, and a more proportional voting system. You can think beyond our political system a bit can't you? Even as it is, the Lords can't do all that much to stop a determined government.

APRs only need to be provided as advertised to 51% of applicants. Don't be dismayed by being offered a higher rate; a lot of people do.

There is no universal credit score. Every lender has their own balanced scorecard approach, and thus there is no universal way to improve your score.

Some things are no-brainers;

* Make sure you're on the electoral roll
* Keep all of your credit accounts in good standing (records go back at least six years, so past discretions follow you).
* Have *some* available credit, that is used at least sometimes.

Above these basics there are some less obvious points, that are largely dependent on which lender is looking

* Don't have too much available but unused credit. Some lenders see this in a poor light
* Don't be too close to credit limits either, this looks like desperation to some
* Some lenders don't like to see all credit paid in full all the time. This might seem crazy, but for credit card providers a large chunk of their profit is made from interest. I would still advise everyone to pay off all their cards in full each month regardless of this.
* Don't move around too much (lenders like to see stability)
* Use the same details for all applications (small differences in address, telephone numbers, etc. can flag up as potential fraud)
* Earn a good income, (potentially vs. your outgoings)

This is not an exhaustive list.

The last point is probably the main reason you didn't get the best rate.

But it makes no sense for us to go into top 4, then get kicked out of the first round like we did under Rodgers  this year because he can't get the hang of Europe. 

We're (England) already on a lowered coefficient because of the English teams getting kicked out of the first round (LFC's efforts didn't help), to the point that come 2016 if we aren't any better, it will be the top three teams for Champions League instead of the top 4. 

If nothing else, Europa league would force Rodgers to use his team efficiently, to learn to love set pieces (because if you look at Atletico Madrid, they get a quarter of their points from set pieces), and learn to love defense. I know that Rodgers scoffs at defense (say wut?), but playing in Europa would force him and our players to love defense and positional play.

I had a similar arrangement - tuition went on the loan and my family was able to cover essential day to day costs such as rent, food, travel etc. I'd highly suggest costing things out and working out roughly how much you'll need for those essentials per month, adding a little bit of a buffer for emergencies and unforeseen things and go back to your father and see if he's still willing to hand that amount of money to you every month. Should things not work out, you should be able to take out the maintenance loan in subsequent years even if you didn't take it in your first one.

Personally, I also took the maintenance loan every year to cover my own personal spending and to save - I had a pre-2012 loan so the rates are much better and I could beat them with a savings account. As the rates stand now, it's only worth taking what you need.

As you've mentioned, placements/sandwich years are a good source of income, I was able to entirely support myself for that year and a lot of extra things on top, e.g. complete PC rebuild. It's also worth noting that you can also do summer placements in addition to your year longer one for extra income and experience. Although you know the salary ranges (and yes, that top end really does exist), do keep in mind that placements are not a guarantee (if your Uni says they are, they likely have some rather poor fallback options for those who don't secure one through the normal application methods).

You've said you don't spend much on social activities now, but that may well change at Uni.

null,false,haloraptor,cnty-wales,Wales,null,"On the contrary, animal researchers in academia and science are often happy to talk about animal research. The problem is that it can be literally dangerous to talk about in a very personal sense. Animal rights activists like to confuse the issue of scientific research with cosmetic testing on animals, and the two things aren't the same at all.

They also assert that we don't need to research in animals any more because of cell cultures or alternative research platforms. That's not true. We're making strides in these areas but for many purposes we need a living, relevant model system. Humans can't be that system. The Greens say that animal physiology often isn't the same, and that's true, but also a misdirection: often, research isn't about the physiology at all but about genetics or molecular pathways which are shared between almost all living animals. Cancer researchers give mice cancer. Seems reasonable. Mice are mammals.

But they also do cancer research in flies. People research Alzheimer's, Huntingdon's, Parkinson's, all in flies (and mice). Scientific research is about using the best tool for a particular purpose - sometimes it's flies or mice or fish, and sometimes it's human cell cultures or computer simulations. Most of the time the solution comes from the collective effort of a number of different kinds of researchers, all building on multiple different kinds of research used to build a bigger and better picture of what's going on.

The clear separation does exist. Scientists are licensed by the Home Office to conduct animal research. The specific kind of research is catalogued, as is the location, person conducting the research, and the establishment in which the research was conducted. The Home Office has and releases figures about the number of animals used in research every year, along with the severity of the research and its aims and objectives.

The more vocal animal rights groups just don't really want to engage with scientists about the issue. The data is all there. The reason scientists don't get vocal or whatever is because we know our research is all accounted for, ethically approved by internal boards and the Home Office. If your project license application isn't up to scratch you won't get licensed. There are specific 'named persons' on the establishment license whose responsibility it is to ensure animal welfare. There's rigorous internal ethical debate on every single project. Ultimately, it's up to individual researchers to ensure that their day to day research is all legal and above board. Once that's done, and everything is properly noted, it's the university's problem. I think on one hand it's a failure of research institutions to engage with the public, but at the same time this is a tricky area because science has had decades of ethical debate and other contextual factors which has meant that animal research is widely accepted. The public in general hasn't had those same experiences, doesn't have the same knowledge of why animal systems might be superior to other methods, nor has it had the same kind of ethical debates as have been present in science. 

To scientists, current practises should be monitored carefully of course but are effectively a non-issue. Not controversial at all. We just want to do science. But the same isn't true for much of the public. But all the information is there. I'm sure if you asked the Home Office they'd be able to give you information. Some universities are now being much more public about animal research especially since it's become a little less militant and terrorist. You just need to look and ask. But for the majority of scientists doing animal research it isn't a hot issue. It's not that there's a lack of willingness to debate. It's that the debate was already had.",null,0,null,1427720959,null,0,false,0,cpvgtlc,null,t3_30slac,null,t1_cpvgtlc,null,t1_cpvfjte,null,null,null,1432095493,null,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11,null

Don't be frightened of that fact though, it was in some ways good i.e. it gave the country some of its social/civil tendencies that are more pronounced (or rather expressed differently) there than they are in England e.g. what in the jargon are irregular forms of marriage (like cohabitation by repute) make it easier to argue for civil partnerships and then on to same-sex marriage. The requirement of 'good faith,' not present in English law, for a valid contract in Scots law is also one that developed from the church -- it's often said as a shorthand that Scots law is 'people based' while English law is 'property based,' and it's arguable that the differences in the churches had a role in this. But these are technical arguments so I won't bore you with the details. 

Thing is churches aren't really private organisations. They're more like social institutions, rather than simply a business or 'club' set up on a whim. They do a lot of community work, and have a clearly observable role in society. 

I think you're conflating having a handful of church figures in Parliament with overriding the separation between church and state. The two are about as separate as it would be even if you banned them from the Lords. You'd just get people campaigning without disclosing religious tendencies (in so far as you can even pretend to separate certain religious values from social values) and they'd be influential anyway. 

In either event, the Lords have very little power in Parliament. Your case would be stronger if they were appointed to the Commons. It just seems like you're getting worked up by some sort of unreasonably rigid belief system where you believe you can neatly separate out all these things and have it work *that* much differently by design. You can't just design perfect social institutions like Lego. It's not that simple.

I live in a rural area where we are on the side of a valley. When the wind blows, it *really* blows - right across the side of the valley and up into my front garden. Where my bike lives. Sadly I'm not fortunate enough to have a garage on the property, so I've had to make do and botch it.

I am frequently terrified that my bike will lift up and dive into the hedge. But fear not - there are solutions!

What I have found about covering the bike in wind *in short*:

* **Don't cover your bike when it's windy (&lt;10mph).** More on why below.
* If you *have* to cover your bike (say you're going away, or you know it's going to snow/rain/chuck down cats and dogs) **buy a big, heavy cover that properly fits your bike**. The [Oxford StormEx is pricey](http://www.sportsbikeshop.co.uk/motorcycle_parts/content_prod/46433) but compared to cheaper/lighter covers, it doesn't move at all. I've had a very light bike (YBR125) sitting under this, in direct wind for 4 weeks through the recent gales and it hasn't so much as moved. Gusts, constant force winds - this cover doesn't care. I've also had a flimy, thin and very light ""rain cover"" on another bike and it billows, looks like a parachute! The StormEx (and covers like it) are so heavy and covers so much of the bike that you need a *lot* of wind to take the bike away.
* **Don't use cheap covers** - read above. It pays to use a heavy duty cover.
* **Don't use thin rain covers** - they aren't heavy or thick enough. You're not protecting from the rain, so these are pretty useless. The wind will find a way under the seam of the cover and the cover will act like a parachute. *This is how your bike goes over - not from direct wind hitting the side of the cover. The wind creeps up into the cover and - because it is connected to your bike (through a belly strap/wheel straps) - will act like a big sail.*
* Even **if you've ridden through a monsoon**, your bike is drenched and you want to put it to bed over the weekend - don't. **Leave the bike uncovered**. Putting a cover on a wet bike promotes condensation and can rust a bike quicker over time. I let the bike naturally dry - even if it constantly rains for a few days - so the damp doesn't get to it with its big quilt on.
* If you *have* to use a cheap, thin rain cover - **use as many bungees, straps and other necessaries to make the cover cling tight to your bike.** I used to use bungees on the front and rear wheels, and the supplied belly strap. This helps to stop wind creeping up into the cover a la sail as mentioned above, but is by no means a definitive solution and I wouldn't recommend using a thin rain cover anyway.
* **Hide the bike from the wind**. If you have a wall or a shed or something you can tuck the bike behind to act as a wind break, this will help a lot. Wind doesn't very often come from all directions, it's normally set from one direction. Find that direction (local BBC weather, Metcheck.com) and - if you can - put your bike somewhere that will break the wind from this direction. 
* **Point the bike into the wind**. This gives the wind a ""smaller target"" to hit. The surface area the wind has to hit (cover on or cover off) is much less, so this can help as well as opposed to have the bike into the wind. Alternatively, **put the bike so the side stand is facing away from the wind**. This will mean that any wind force that pushes on your bike will push it onto the kickstand. The kickstand spring will just compress more as it does this, as opposed to being blown away from the kickstand where if the bike goes vertical - will likely go over.

I'm toying with the idea of putting a shed or a popup bike garage in the garden, but short of that the bike has to be outside. By far the StormEx is worth it in my opinion, but the price for essentially a bike duvet might be a bit hard to stomach for some.

Apart from that you have the other 'conditional' positions:

* Labour's policy is that a referendum would be required for any more transfer of power in the EU (which would effectively end up being an in/out referendum)

If Labour shifted their policies to the left, and were able to stop the haemorrhaging of votes they're currently seeing to the SNP, then they might well hold a lot more of their Scottish seats.

However, that shift to the left might well cost them the chance of winning a lot of swing seats.

If you're wanting to look at the overall balance of Parliament, and want that balance shifted to the left, surely you're better with a more centrist Labour Party able to capture more swing seats while losing seats on the left to the SNP, than you are with a more left-wing Labour that wins its heartlands but loses the swings.",null,0,null,1427723417,null,0,false,0,cpvhvfr,null,t3_30pipn,null,t1_cpvhvfr,null,t1_cpukq9z,null,null,null,1432096059,null,1,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,1,null

My answer: Greens or LibDems... Both seem better than the Conservatives. LibDems because... Urr... Tactical voting.

What I would have liked to have said: ideologically I'm more aligned to the Greens but they're a a young party and where we are don't have much of a a chance of getting in. I'm not as favourable towards the LibDems but they are our best bet of dislodging the Conservatives in this area.

&gt; so you seem like you'd like to see a coalition?

My answer: Umm. What? Who? [between for example LibDems and Labour]. Oh right, yeah, well nobody's going to get a majority are they?

My preferred answer: whilst a lot of people are against the idea of a coalition, it looks unavoidable. Other countries seem to function quite well with coalition governments so maybe we should be looking at our system and seeing if we could reform it.

&gt;so why do you prefer the Greens and LibDems over the Conservatives?

Answer: Umm.. Well the conservatives have messed up the economy with austerity. Whilst I agree that cuts have to be made, they've been.. Ur.. Targeting the vulnerable and that.  Dismantling the welfare state. The Greens and LibDems have a much more... Ummm... Positive approach to the poor and vulnerable.

Preferred: Osborne's throttling of the economy through austerity has been both disproportional towards certain groups and has had a very negative effect on the recovery. Whilst I agree cuts have to be made I don't think the Conservatives are going about it the right way. They both have a better attitude towards the poor and vulnerable, not seeing them as scroungers. Neither are perfect by any means but both are committed to those at the bottom rather than the top.

I'm not the guy you were arguing with before. That's Evil_Yoss. I'm Bananageddon. sorry to have barged in like that. 

&gt;Why have you decided that anything has been decided on the basis of ""sitcom"" clichÃ©s, rather than... things they've actually witnessed them doing?
Since when is it verboten for someone to criticise another person's behaviour because you've decided they belong to the wrong group? If a black man from London decides that he would like to ""police"" a white, home counties gay man by declaring that he finds the way he talks offensive, is that homophobic now? Or maybe it's racist instead?

I guess I decided that it was on the basis of ""sitcom"" cliches, cos this happened in the UK, not the US. I've met a handful of gay white Americans who occasionally use African American Vernacular English kinda in the style of an African American women, but never a white gay brit. And I've certainly never met a white gay brit who imitates black british women. 

My point there is that this is a motion based on a perception of an issue in a different country, filtered through the media.

&gt;The motion concerned was submitted by the LGBT committee, so on what basis have you decided that no gay men or black women were involved in it's making?

This happened at the NUS Women's Conference, right? I assumed that meant it was a conference for women... I may be wrong about that one. But either way, the decision comes from the leadership of the NUS (or maybe just the Women's conference part of it), meaning the problem of non-gay people policing the behavior of gay people is still there. 

And banning drag...? Come the fuck on. There isn't some bar of queerness that you have to pass before you're allowed to do some gender bending. That's just silly.

The idea of communism was undoubtedly appealing, many governments in capitalist countries feared communist revolutions (peaceful or otherwise) and so efforts were made to make capitalism more inclusive, we got communist ideas like the welfare state, workers rights, and free universal healthcare mixed into an otherwise capitalist system.

That would get old real quick though. Because if the English coefficient gets cut to three in 2016/17- Italy or Germany would get the extra CL place, or even Spain could-  it's then only going to be Chelsea, Man City and Arsenal for the foreseeable future (on the strength of wages, and players that we can attract. Man City has money, Chelsea has money and Arsenal has Arsene Wenger - Sanchez and Ozil went to Arsenal so they could be 'developed' by Wenger). With the way how FSG operates as I get it, they want young and upcoming talent, and with Rodgers, he's still a relatively unknown entity.

Obviously UKIP, BNP and greens are off the table for being the bat-shit crazy lunatic fringe, and I'm not going to vote so someone can boast about how many votes they got. So I'm down to the traditional 3.

Labour - It's not so much that I hate Labour, I like a lot of the theoretical ideals, but the practise with them has always been far short of that. Still have bad memories of the evils of Blair &amp; Brown, and while the current crop may not be outwardly evil, they're also not outwardly competent either. The biggest problem though is that they really give me no reason at all to vote for them - just against others, so their only argument is ""at least they're not X"" - which is completely antithical to my core beliefs on democracy - you should never vote for someone based on who they aren't, only on who they are.

Lib Dem - for all the stick they get for various things - mostly out of their control - I don't think they've done a bad job. As the by-far junior partner, you really don't get to call the shots. They have decent enough policies and seem vaguely capable, and also of note they seem to lack the lunatic fringes of both the Tories and labour. Do they do enough to warrant something as important as a vote, though?

Conservatives - they seem - as ever - to be the most economically sensible and capable party. In contrast, I might see the Lib Dems as maybe possibly capable of running an economy responsibly, and Labour not. On the flip-side, there's a bit too much of the old boys club about them - they're also a little too detached from the real world and while a lot of their decisions make financial sense, they are indifferent at best to those negatively affected by them. They also have a lot of archaic sections, being against things like gay marriage, etc. At least Cameron being at the helm has held them off on that front, though.

Bad for the environment? In what way - GM crops often require less pesticide use and the decreased need for plowing fields to bury weeds also increases soil carbon sequestration. GMO usage saves about 4 billion KG of carbon dioxide compared to regular farming per year in the USA alone. Sure there's some minor impact on herbicide resistance in weeds, but that occurs independently from GM anyway - glyphosate is used on conventional crops too.

Bad economics? Nah. Every single country that has planted GM crops have seen increased profitability per hectare. 

Bad for politics and society? This is a very vague argument. Are people going to start spontaneously combusting or something from growing GMOs?

I'd like to hear what the best alternative is. Because it sure isn't organic.

Although his seat is supposed to be safe (been held for 30 years), recent polls have shown it has real potential to swing towards Labour.

null,false,smokey815,num11,,null,"I very rarely have specific players I'd like to sign.  I have more of a type in mind, usually.  

Ideally, a versatile, quick winger.  Someone who can play either side, though I'd want them to be a left winger primarily.  Unless we try Townsend on the left, which I'm still convinced can work.  But the idea is I want someone who's quick and decisive, who links up well with Kane and Eriksen and is smart.  Basically I want someone who understands space and movement.  So a combinaiton of the best of Townsend and Lamela.  A bit unrealistic, as that's a top quality player and probably not readily available, but I did say ideally.  Depay, for example, is probably out of our reach, if I'm honest with myself.

A quick forward.  Obviously a good finisher, but someone who can play off the back shoulder and loves to get in behind.  Not quite the next JD, because I'd obviously rather he pass the ball on occasion.  Ings is the general idea I'm getting at here, but anyone who fits that mold would work.  Also, it would make a two forward formation function.  Kane dropping off could actually work, because we'd have someone who's an actual real threat pushing the defenders back.  It would give Kane more room, and wouldn't allow him to nullify out attacking threat by dropping deep.

Pending departures, a center mid. Alli is probably coming in.  That mean at least two of Mousa, Benji, Capoue, and Paulinho realistically could leave.  Capoue is probably the first on on the list based on his lack of any kind of playing time recently.  After that, it's all down to Poch.  Who can he find a use for?  I honestly don't know that we'd truly need to let someone go. Both Mousa and Paulinho can fil in as an attacking mid well enough, and Benji has shown some good flashes despite his lack of pace.  Ideally, we'd get someone who has Mason's tenacity and and work rate, but with a better passing range and a little less frenetic in positioning.  The other option I'd like to see is an aggressive ball winning midfielder.  Someone who can slot into Bentaleb's role and let him get a run as the more attacking player.  Depending on Alli, we might not need anyone.  Bentaleb needs to be on the pitch in my opinion, and I think between Alli and Mason, we'll be hard pressed to find time for all our players.  It all depends on how Poch plans to use Alli I think.

We could also use a defender, as long as we're letting someone go.  Dier, Vert, and Fazio are all players I want to see getting minutes next year, Wimmer makes four if we bring him in.  I don't see Kaboul being an option next year.  I'd like to keep Vlad around, as both Fredericks and Yedlin are unknown quantities at the Premier League level, and Vlad has filled in pretty damn well at right back this year, all things considered.  I've not quite given up on him yet, his actual ability is quite good.  He might even be an option at DM.  His aggressive play style could be good in the press, and he's got a good touch on him.

As far as attacking mid goes, I'm not really worried about it.  We haven't got another playmaker right now, but I don't think we could find a guy who can fill in well for Eriksen that wouldn't be expecting more play time.  Pritch might be able to make it happen, but depending on that situation, I think using a different type of player in Paulinho or Mousa is our best option.",null,0,null,1427725772,null,0,false,0,cpvj1eo,null,t3_30shcz,null,t1_cpvj1eo,null,t3_30shcz,null,null,null,1432096608,null,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2,null

How is it bollocks? I'd similarly argue that virtually no country has ever been a purely capitalist one in the last 100 years. Depending on who you ask (by which I mean people who actually understand how they are defined), there are pretty core traits of socialism/communism that no country has realistically attempted to retain for a significant period of time. 

&gt;Cuba, Lao and Vietnam actively define themselves as working towards the complete application of socialism

If I define myself as a muslim then talk about Jesus Christ the resurrected son of God, am I now a Muslim? Is the Democratic People's Republic of Korea a democratic nation? No, because those things have clear definitions; following the tenets set out in the Quran, or deriving authority to rule via consent of the governed. The ""No True Scotsman"" problem is only relevant when you are talking about something nebulous that you haven't bothered to define objectively; being a ""real man"" or ""true Scotsman"" or a ""real American.""

VVietnam has spent the past 35 years recovering from 35 years of war, and before that they were not a developed nation. Compare them right now to Germany in 1980, Germany had just been brought near to ruin by the end of the Second World War, but they had an industrial economy and aid from the Americans to help them recover. Meanwhile Vietnam did not have an industrialized economy nor did they get aid except from a wheezing, collapsing Soviet state.

null,false,Hemmers,null,null,null,"&gt; I must confess I'm not particularly politically inclined, but from my understanding a lot of the Lords are just wealthy old businessmen and such.
&gt; Why do they get to decide what laws are passed? Surely it would make sense to actually have academics etc from relevant fields.

Some of them are hereditary (92 of 787), but the Lords has been massively reformed in the past couple of decades - the 1999 Reform Act cut the number of hereditary peers down to 92 from much higher levels previously. And they are still voted in by other Lords from a pool of larger eligible peers via a system I don't really understand.

There's quite a lot of ex-Ministers get a Lordship when they retire from the Commons. There are also people like Alan Sugar and Anthony Bamford who are leading businessmen who (having run multinationals for a few decades) have a fair idea what impact laws will have on the British economy and marketplace.

There are also 26 ""Lords Spiritual"" who are the holders of certain religious positions such as ""Archbishop of x"", the idea being they are totally apolitical and looking out for the pastoral and general welfare of the country.

So it's certainly not like the old days when it was just a handful of hereditary Lords. Most of the people there are either:

* elevated by the Queen (on the advice of the Prime Minister) as Life Peers (so not hereditary), or
* sit there via some position, such as having a particular ecclesiastical role or being the Lord Great Chamberlain

null,false,Hemmers,null,null,null,"&gt; Most countries have two elected houses - I don't see it as any more (or less) of a legitimacy problem that is faced by all other politicians.

True, but they don't all work, e.g. America where Republican Houses can and have blocked various edicts from Obama not because they believe them to be wrong but because they came out of a Democrat White House. They're worse than a bunch of primary school kids sometimes.

That sort of party politics is something we can do without. No sane individual would have any desire whatsoever to import that (or anything like it) to the UK!

I'm not really sure that there's a problem in principle with an upper house of appointed academics, businessmen and subject experts (who as it happens, tend only to vote on topics they actually know about. Alan Sugar for instance doesn't typically vote on deep genetics and ethics topics. He knows business, he leaves that for the biochemists and sticks his oar in on pertinent regulatory issues, etc).

Whether they should be life peers, or appointed for 20 years or something - anything else would be too short. A Prime Minister with a couple of consecutive terms could pretty heavily load the Lords with stooges if they all cycled out after 5-10 years. A 20 year term makes the House relatively immune to the influence of newly elevated members.

Obviously it does work in other places, but it also doesn't work in some places, so the implications need very careful consideration about one/two house systems, who represents who, who checks and balances each section, etc.",null,0,null,1427727910,null,0,false,0,cpvk74j,null,t3_30slao,null,t1_cpvk74j,null,t1_cpvfmuq,null,null,null,1432097154,null,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12,null

Individuals lied to get these mortgages (there is the famous story of the Vegas stripper who self certified to get 6 mortgages on 6 different flats).

The agressive expansion was again encouraged by govt. Ministers at the time.

There is insurance companies like AIG who until they were bailed out by the govt. came within a few days of going bust. And yet we never hear complaints about them using taxpayers money to sponsor Man. United

A problem is, that you can be having a state funded flat in say Covent Garden, which now would require a 7 figure sum to buy, but have no income, maybe you are retired, and yet your life style would be preferable in many ways to someone who is working around there, despite them showing as a higher income. So when you compare incomes, and consider how much goes on rent, tax and no direct benefits, a rise in GINI doesn't really mean that much.

This is why I get so concerned about affordable housing, I think we're screwing over a younger generation, if you compare rents in London, as they are today, to what was available 10 years ago it's shocking.  It's the same house, the same quality of life, yet on GINI it would appear that the gap has widened.  Someone could appear to have earning a lot more than me, yet have less money left over after paying for housing, than I do, because I bought my place years ago.

During a recession, I would also say that 'the rich' often change places, like some grim game of musical chairs.  For every Blockbuster Videos we've got a new Netflix.

But accommodation to me is the shocking one.  I was cycling past a rather nice house the other day, it had a for sale sign, I looked it up.  It first sold in 92, for around Â£280k.  It last sold in 2010 for Â£1.8M.  If I had bought, and lived in that same house back in the 90s, that would have been a property about 23 times annual median wage.  Now, it's 75 times annual median wage.  Roughly.

I'm sorry but Hazard has always been an amazing player. He was the reason Lille became champion of France and won the cup. Gervinho, Rudi Garcia, they will all say the same. Go talk to Lille supporters here on reddit. He run that team and gave them momentum. Lille wasn't a big team. 6-7 spot and even mid '90 fighting against relegation. That's how big it was. The fact that he came to a club under Di Matteo who didn't have the time, because he got sacked, to implement him in the right order, and later Benitez, who obviously wasn't loved and would leave at the end of the season, didn't help. I mean, Benitez would rotate him with Moses and Marin and didn't make him a key player! He would get either 70 min or 20 min. Insane! Under Mourinho he got the trust he needed, became a key player who dictates the attacking game and that's how you use him. 

The english schedule is pretty tough indeed. I believe it is one of many reasons as to why English teams tend to disappoint in Europe.

LOL, quite. I really think Rodgers said yes to the job too soon, and I wince that we're going to be the club that he gets his training wheels on, before moving on to somewhere else (as much as he jaws on about LFC being the destination he's also said that he's keen to coach in Spain).

But he genuinely didn't used to feel like that. Out of everyone I know he has probably done more charitable things and helped more people out than I can think of. He still helps out his 'well to do' friends when they hit financial issues - he recently gifted a Â£15k car to someone who wasn't able to afford to keep theirs.

But with those who are at the bottom of the pile, his patience has definitely worn thin.

I think it is perhaps a misplaced guilt that when so many people are seeing their living standards fall, and he is not (frankly he is doing really well over the past 5 years) that he has to say something to justify that. 

But the reality is it's just a shit situation, it's not his fault, the global economy got fucked and a lot of people have struggled and we've had a few rather nasty sets of policies aimed to drive a wedge between the rich and the poor.

null,false,Nayyyyy,null,null,null,"Specific to your post:

'Aristocrats' were a left over social group who retained titles to land - if owned or became ceremonial - were largely part of what was defined as the 'upper class'.

A few general trends:

* Most people self-identify as middle class now
* Post-war prosperity (seen as an outcome of rebuilding and re-distribution of wealth through the welfare state) benefited lower and middle class. Middle class benefited the most. It also benefited the upper class since they gained more wealth, but *as a proportion* of total wealth they decline.

Study of class:

* How social class is studied and defined has changed over time;
* Traditionally it was your profession since this was linked to earning. However it wasn't linked to wealth. So an example though experiment: if you were once a CEO of an investment tech firm you'd be seen as upper class. If you retire early and become a part time lecturer or consultant you may be seen as middle class because of less pay, yet you still retain your large savings and consumptionary lifestyle. See the problem of definition?
* Now definitions can range from: profession, housing, values, cultural capital which are tested. Then you have self-identification by people.
* Studies on social class has mainly focused on traditionally define 'lower' and 'middle' there doesn't exist much on the 'upper' because a) smaller group, b) not welcoming to study mainly, c) hard to define considering the existence of the 'new rich'

Recent stuff:

* The BBC example identifies 7 distinct social classes in their most recent Great British Class Survey (if I remember the name correctly)

I agree though, a Scot, especially living in Scotland, voting for UKIP seems quite a silly choice. My views are generally right wing, and sometimes right of the Tories. But if I had to choose between Ukip and Tories to govern, I'd choose Tories, they seem to be more coherent in their stance and plans. 

I'm pretty sure Wales need the money more than Scotland, just take the NHS as an example, worst in all of Britain. In my opinion, there is way to much allowed for Scotland to have, all because the politicians are scared of a UK break up. It should be proportional, England with the largest proportion seeing as they have the largest population and GDP. I honestly feel, in the long run, it would be better if Scotland chose to become independent. To me, the country seems like a child crying when they don't get all their sweets.

It's not ludicrous and it's not a stereotype, the Conservative economic policy is based on right wing capitalist ideas, it's simply a fact.

A succession of three Labour politicians acted as leader of the opposition for the purpose of allowing the House of Commons to function normally, but opposition did not run under a party-whipped system. As the government was a coalition government in which Labour politicians functioned fully as members of the government: neither Deputy Prime Minister Clement Attlee nor these three received the salary for the post of leader of the opposition. The largest party that opposed the war and was not part of the coalition - and therefore, in theory, the opposition was the Independent Labour Party. With only three MPs, it tried to take over the opposition frontbench but was widely opposed in this venture.

During WWII the government had a majority of 609 compared to Cameron and Clegg's 78-seat majority.

In the event of a grand coalition, my guess would be that Labour and the Tories would share the government frontbench. Individual government backbenches would probably be claimed by either party. Due to their huge majority, I wouldn't be surprised if they take some of the opposition backbenches.
 
The Lib Dems or the SNP would take the opposition frontbench depending on which has the most seats. I would expect the other to take the other frontbench on the opposition side (the one where Labour's ""awkward squad"" sit now or where the Lib Dems used to sit 2005-2010. The other parties would probably sit on the benches behind that. N.b. Plaid generally form a common parliamentary group with the SNP, so they'd likely sit with them.",null,0,null,1427736140,null,0,1427736993,0,cpvp5h4,null,t3_30pl22,null,t1_cpvp5h4,null,t1_cpvepu3,null,null,null,1432099559,null,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2,null

As an American Spurs fan who has made the trip to England to see a couple matches -- it doesn't change anything really. I never really felt like I needed to prove how much of a fan I was. We have to be careful not to take Reddit as representative of the larger fan base or population of anything, and that includes Tottenham (or soccer) fans. 

You'd be surprised how many English Tottenham fans are overjoyed to see an American, let alone an Asian-American, show up to a pub in London in a Spurs shirt, singing the songs, supporting the team. A lot of our supporters want this to be a global team, and are thrilled to see that it's becoming that. Not everyone sees American fans as interlopers or play-actors. I was treated like a king by the Spurs fans I met -- even the drunk-as-shit ones -- and I've always been proud to support this club, even since I was a little kid.

As a counter-example, I've been a Los Angeles Lakers fan pretty much as long as I've been a Tottenham fan. Whenever I meet fans from around the world wearing a Kobe shirt or a Lakers cap, and they tell me they support the team, I'm always glad to hear it. Even if they're just casual fans, I think it's great. Most people are like that. Support is an inclusive activity, ultimately, not an exclusive one. 

So, I would counsel my fellow USandAers to not take the highly exclusionary /r/soccer anti-American vibe to heart. It's absolute bullshit. This subreddit is wonderfully inclusive, and most real-life fans of this team are, as well. Support the team proudly, and in your own way, and it will give back to you in spades.

So here comes a big wall of text :)

There are a number of ""red flags"" in your post and comments which suggest you might not be approaching financial decisions in the best way.

One of the things you seem to be doing, which is very common with people of all ages, but bad and wrong nonetheless, is looking at your ""position"" and what you ""should"" be able to afford. Practically everyone does this - we compare ourselves to others and see what seems sensible. Unfortunately, it's also a common route to lifestyle inflation, unnecessary spending and sometimes financial difficulties. Many people who get themselves into financial trouble, or even just fail to get ""ahead"" in life aren't buying Ferraris and caviar - they're buying ""nice"" but not obviously stupid things that seem to fit with their income and/or social status, but not properly making financial decisions based on their whole financial circumstances and long-term goals. Though decisions early in life may not be critical, this mode of thinking is, IMO, often very damaging. A habit to avoid.

Another red flag is that you have an income around 17k (I'm not sure whether you mean before or after tax, but this really applies either way), *NO* outgoings, but would need to borrow to buy a Â£7.4k car. This either means that you've had a load of disposable income, and have spent (almost) all of it, or that you haven't been in your job very long. In the first case this indicates that you're not really managing your money well (if you're now in the position of wanting a new car and don't have the money for it) - which won't be helped by a car payment anyway. In the second case this means that my next issue is even more of a concern...

(Edit: I suppose it's also possible that you've been paying off debt and have only just eliminated it. I'd still suggest not being so keen to take on more debt and to build up some funds first!)

You seem to be assuming that your income will continue. I don't know your circumstances, but this is rarely something you can rely on. Even if your job is going amazingly well, ill health, management fraud, unexpected takeover, and so on can all be a rapid route to unemployment. Even family wealth isn't that reliable (though perhaps moreso if we're talking hundreds of millions) - I know someone who had a well-off family who paid for her living expenses, car, etc. And then their businesses went wrong and they weren't, anymore. There may have been a court case.

The most obvious issue is that the prospective purchase seems to be largely a luxury item, and you (were) looking at borrowing money to fund it. You may well need a car, but the cost of this car, combined with the general impression I get does not suggest that this was an urgent need in order to keep working (or something similarly critical). If it had been, it might make rather more sense to borrow to fund it. Borrowing to pay for luxury items is almost always the wrong decision. There's nothing wrong with wanting (or even buying, necessarily) luxuries, but if you're paying interest because you have to have them now, you'll be able to afford far fewer luxuries in your life, overall. Furthermore, research indicates that once you secure the basics you adapt quickly luxury (ie, ""nicer"") possessions so they don't bring you that much additional happiness (spending on experiences - or even to do good for others - usually has a better happiness return). (I might also be more convinced if it was going to, say, help you be more successful with women. But a diesel hatchback probably isn't going to do that for you.)

Of course, a lot of this is based on my impression of your circumstances, so please ignore anything that doesn't actually apply.

Here's an exercise that I think you (well, everyone) should do: work out how much you *actually* get paid per hour. Take your after-tax income and deduct any expenses incurred as a result of your job (commuting, clothes, extra lunch expense if you don't pack your lunch), divide by the actual number of hours you expend for your work (include commuting time, unpaid overtime, and probably lunchtime and breaks unless you spend that time doing what you'd really want to be doing if you weren't at work, but deduct holidays). Then remember that this is your finite once-only lifespan and energy (that you can't apply to other things) that you're selling, and that even if you enjoy your job at the moment this won't be the case all the time. Then, when considering an expenditure, work it out in hours as well as pounds.

It's nice to have nice things, but it's nicer to have no debt. It's better still to have enough money to support yourself for 6 months or more - an emergency fund or ""fuck you"" money - and not be beholden to a particular employer or frightened of losing your job. And I think it'll be really good to be financially independent and free from the obligation of finding an income - but I'm not quite there yet so I can't be sure :)

You might read around that site for information - there is a free guide which is quite extensive and she keeps updated as the experts in the field come out with new recommendations.

True retinol is a solid active for anti ageing if used regularly over a long period of time, see the vitamin A entry in our ingredients Wiki for more information. Don't remember seeing research on retinol and eczema tho. 

Do review your intake of vitamin D rich foods (oily fish,experts advocate up to four servings a week) I have been reading of the links with vitamin D insufficiency. It is the classic time of year to be short on vitamin D just coming out of a UK winter.

Can Toure Sakho 

Ibe Henderson Lucas Markovic

Sterling Coutinho 

Balotelli

Only reason I picked Toure over Lovren is because I believe we need a more physical prowess in the middle of the 3. I still have faith in Balo and believe he can step up. Even though Rodgers will probably start Lallana ahead of him and play Sterling up top I think this team is the best one for this game. Ibe and Sterling on the right along with Coutinho and Markovic on the left will cause them problems. Lucas will break everything up and to top it all of this team has a ton of pace. 

Up the reds.

This is done for one purpose, to increase their profits without any mention of residents rights. They are brazen enough to mention the fact that Bristol is going through a housing crisis and this is the right time to cash in. What that actually means is that people on low incomes will look at losing their homes, or having significant extra hardship in their lives due to increased rent. Those who lose their homes may have to move away from their communities, or end up in substandard but cheaper houses.  
Please take a second or two to sign this, and while your at it maybe check out Acorn who are at the forefront of protecting renters rights and sticking up for the little guy in Bristol (they recently managed to get the council to vote in an Ethical Letting Charter, making Bristol the such city to do so in the UK)

If you were assuming they were going to remove the money from your account later, why would you then spend it? 

I can relate to it being a welcome change, but having 'extra' in that situation isn't *really* an advantage - if it's going to be taken back then you still need to budget as if it isn't there at all (or otherwise have a plan to put it back before it's taken).

As a sidenote, I don't think it's that easy for anyone to just ""take back"" money that they've put into your account; that's your account and they can't just access it at will.

- You probably spend at least 1 million per year on expenses. 
- Playing this extremely conservatively you have 600K left over to invest. Over 5 years this is 3 million pounds.

Partly, but the bigger part was the consequence of the Council not negotiating after being notified of pay discrepancies over 15 years.

You're simplifying it as indoor-based women cleaners on part time hours being paid a lower rate than male cleaners on garden\outdoor\garbage duties on part time hours.  This carried on throughout the council with jobs with similar responsibilities outdoor vs indoor work, male vs female, peak time vs unsocial hours duties and so on.  Plus, you'll know from years of seeing it in the press that women tend to have less opportunity for working hours that fit in with childcare (and yes, men can do childcare too, but remember, this has been going on for 20 years with changing work patterns!) so were getting less hours, putting them under a third tier of part time hourly pay lower than other staff members of either gender.

Time and time again they were engaged by unions and various HR committee groups - the latter a sure fire way of achieving a lot of time, work and overtime, but fuck all to do with achieving the actual objective - trying to sort out a plan to regrade and respecify pay in a fairer way, but many administrations faffed, started, stopped, messed about until finally it went into legal action.

The Council is to blame for not sitting down and sorting it out a long time back - not women claiming sexism.

And don't forget - another part of the blame is the huge dip in funding councils across the country have, due to the current government's ~~inability to see anywhere outside of London as worthy of investment~~ austerity measures.",null,0,null,1427742472,null,0,false,0,cpvt69p,null,t3_30tt4v,null,t1_cpvt69p,null,t1_cpvrele,null,null,null,1432101453,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

I used to have KP on the back of my upper arms as well. A few years back, I started to shower with TBS Bath Gloves (sort of like Salux cloth, but in gloves form which makes it easier for me) and I applied generic AmLactin afterwards (I forgot what's the name. Sorry!) which was rather thick but it really helped. My KP finally disappeared after a couple months!

Now, I still shower with the gloves and use whatever shower cream/gel. I personally love Dove shower cream pistachio-magnolia, hibiscus-almond and shea-vanilla. I love the nutty smell and creamy feel and boyfriend loves it, too. I still try to get body lotion with special properties. 

Aside from the generic AmLactin, I've tried

* **Neostrata Ultra Smoothing Lotion** *(acidic smell, worked nicely to maintain KP-free, but pricey)*
* **Palmer's Cocoa Butter Formula Anti-Aging Smoothing Lotion with AHA/BHA** *(smells like coffee to me, worked nicely to maintain KP-free, but I live in Malta and it's not available in here so I had to order online, too much a hassle for me)*
* **Dove Pro-Age Nourishing Lotion** *(currently using, boyfriend doesn't like the smell so he got his own body lotion, a tad tacky, keeps me KP-free, but it has never occurred again so I don't think it's the lotion, I get less bumps on my legs, though)*

Now I still have marks on where the KP was. Like freckles because they're darker than my skin, but they're faded and not too noticeable anymore.

I think **Eucerin 10% Urea** should be a good choice in EU/UK. **Avene Akerat** is often recommended as well. If I remember correctly, A-Derma also has one. **Exomega**, IIRC. What I've heard is that they are on the thick side, while the lotions I've tried are on the thin side, but they're not specifically made for KP. **CeraVe SA Renewing Lotion** should be good as well, but I don't know if it's available in UK.

In theory I agree that Wales needs more funding, and Scotland could probably survive with less. I generally agree with that principle and so should everyone who considers themself on the left. But why does UKIP? It seems silly to me to suggest that UKIP is the party that stands for redistribution of wealth. And indeed that is not how they justify their planned spending cuts for Scotland. UKIP are appealing to a sense that England has somehow been screwed over by what they themselves denounced as the Scottish subsidy junky. 

It doesn't make sense for them to trap out this argument and then increse the actual subsidies to Wales. The inconsistency screams faithless electioneering. Cutting the budget for Scotland is a vote winner in the Southeast and it doesn't matter because UKIP is dead in Scotland. Yet they can't cut the Welsh budget because UKIP may have a chance there.

And in reality it will just kill the union anyway. You say Scotland cries whenever Westminster takes away our sweets but why shouldn't we? Why should we endeavor to keep our politically diverging countries together, be expected to accept governments we have overwhelmingly rejected and then accept UKIP draining our finances almost by the entire budget of the Scottish NHS? I know that I would vote for independence in this scenario. And I'm sure most England wouldn't feel that they were crying for sweets if the EU imposed such terms.

If Northern England wants to bend over and take what is handed to them then that's good for them. But when Thatcher oversaw Glasgow's descent into post-industrial poverty while simultaneously pumping billions out of the North Sea we learned that we will only ever be screwed that way.

And the reason I don't agree with your final comparison is that I don't think there is one. I am not under the illusion that the SNP will ever represent rUK interests.

null,false,[deleted],null,null,null,"&gt; On nuclear, we do not currently support any form of nuclear generated power. This is due partly to concern about the risk of accidents, but we also have other concerns.

Well, the accident rate of nuclear is low, very strictly regulated and historically less people have died per unit of energy generated than from any other power source.

&gt; First, we regard the UK current carbon floor settings as having been set specifically with nuclear in mind, that is, the floor is set too high in order to enable nuclear to remain below it.

You'd need a Tier 2 visa, which are only issued by certain firms which have been authorised by the government and which are capped at 20,000 visas per year, meaning they're only used for the most skilled workers whose skills can't be found or trained in the UK. These people tend to work full-time for large salaries.

You can, however, as a Canadian citizen, apply for a two-year working holiday visa, which you can work for. Look it up on the UKBA site. You will have an easier time fulfilling the visa requirements, getting here and finding a job than doing it the other way around and finding a job only for your visa application to be held up or denied.

Edit:

[Details about the Tier 5 Visa - Working Holiday](https://www.gov.uk/tier-5-youth-mobility/overview)

- You must be aged 18-30

- You must be able to demonstrate the equivalent of Â£1,890 in savings after visa fees etc (for reference it cost me about Â£500 to get a Canadian work permit in 2012)

Cleansed? I'm just talking about the simple concept of keeping religion out of politics. France is a perfect example of a modern and prosperous secular society.

I think you're totally misunderstanding what secularism is. As a lawyer, you should know better. It's not hostility towards religion, it's hostility towards to idea of mixing religion with politics. I am very open minded and have no problem with people practicing religion, live and let live. I was brought up Catholic, myself. I have a problem when religions are given special treatment and placed on a pedestal in society, and when people are allowed to use their religion to force their beliefs on other people. That's unacceptable to me (and I assume it's unacceptable to you, too).

I am not a zealot as I have no problem with people of faith. I don't want to force my non-belief on anyone. I believe that religious people have the right to freedom of religion just as much as I have the right to freedom *from* religion. I don't think my freedom from religion should be compromised to give religious people special privileges.

And yes, I don't think private organisations should be given special privileges in society either. Churches are no exemption to this rule. I am a reasonable person, and I like to think I'm quite an empathetic and rational person as well.
