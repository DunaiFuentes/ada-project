null,false,ShartyMcPeePants,lfc87,null,null,"&gt;Part of it has to do I think with many of the older crowd viewing Brendan as a bit of a snake oil salesman

I mean he came across as a bit of an arrogant prick in Being:Liverpool and some of the first interviews I've seen from him, but I don't know why older fans would pin him as a ""snake oil salesman"" as you put it.  Maybe you can enlighten me on that?

&gt;I suspect another part is the older crowd have been through so many manager changes it's sort of expected at this point. Myself, I've been through ten or something like that from Fagan to now, so I just don't see it as that big of a deal really whereas I read a comment from a newer/younger supporter on here the other day where there exposure had been from Hodgson (awful) to now by which BR probably does seem a god send in comparison.

I've only been supporting Liverpool/following football since the near end of the Benitez era.  So I started at a pretty depressing stage as well and I can totally see your point.  Rodgers has given me more hope than any other manager in the past 7-8 years that I have been supporting the club.  I just feel that Brendan is at the perfect point in his career to lead our club.  He isn't as established as Klopp, obviously, but he is young and hungry like the rest of our team.  He's a young manager and you have to expect mistakes, just as you have to expect Sterling to make bonehead decisions on and off the pitch.  

Maybe it has been so long since the older generation has seen a successful Liverpool side compete on multiple fronts that your patience has run out.  I started following football at a point where managers aren't given much time and its expected for managers to have short stints at clubs.  Its refreshing to me to see a manager be given a real opportunity to build a team and try and lead them to success.  I fear that signing Klopp will just lead to more problems.  What happens if Klopp hasn't won anything in 2-3 years?  He could easily find a new job and we would have trouble finding a replacement.  I don't want to go through that again.  I want us to be consistent and have a manager who is hungry and passionate about the club.  I think we have that in Rodgers, so why risk losing it?

The decision referred to an earlier case where the decision included the statement, ""The court would only interfere if it were to conclude that the state's judgement as to what was in the public interest was manifestly without reasonable foundation"".  All this being the case, prima facie I would say that unless the government can't make a 'reasonable foundation' case for public interest, the housing associations wouldn't have a snowflake's chance in Hell of standing up.

Beyond this, the difficulty with a charity might be who is deprived of possession, if the properties were sold off.  The ultimate owner would be (I think) a charitable trust, so I'm not sure there's a human to have their Article 1 right violated.  Unless the trustees claimed it was their rights, which would be beyond perverse.

Personally I find it impossible not to see this as senior charity executives wanting to use funds intended for the public good to defend their own comfy positions.",null,0,null,1429153212,null,0,false,0,cqdxvyf,null,t3_32ktb7,null,t1_cqdxvyf,null,t1_cqcc88c,null,null,null,1432418227,null,2,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,2,null

null,false,Buffaluffasaurus,null,null,null,"&gt; To get a squad that can compete on four fronts, when you eventually qualify CL, you need depth unless the goal is to accomplish a Liverpool (which is actually what happened last time we played in the CL. Our first time was better than our current team, but depth was not there so we failed to qualify for the subsequent round).
So that leaves us with two recruiting options if we want to have some significance in the CL if we qualify and want to qualify for the next competition. Either recruit slowly and assess the players over a season when they settle so that we're ready when we do qualify or recruit in numbers like we did last season. Unless there is a third course of action we can take I'm not aware of? We need four competitions to assess players and not let them stagnate.

I think ultimately Levy needs to decide what he wants the club to be - profitable or in the Champions League.  He can't have it both ways.

We can go seriously after some good talent this summer to create better depth and a better quality first XI, but it's going to cost money.

Or we can take a punt on cheaper options (undervalued players, misfits not getting enough game time at bigger clubs, and youth), and hope that pays off like it did last time we were in the Champions League and we managed to have Bale, VDV, Modric and Adebayor all firing on the same time at the same time.

Of course long term sustainability is important, but we're not going to lock down 4th place overnight.  It might take five seasons, and we only get 4th twice in that time.  But we need to at least be in contention for 4th, and we haven't been for two straight seasons now.

I just don't see how our current recruitment policy is going to generate a reliably good enough team over the course of the next five years.  We might get lucky for one or two seasons if players like Kane, Eriksen and Lloris are willing to stick around (no guarantees there), but if we lose even 1 or 2 of those guys this summer, there's fuck all chance of replacing them adequately without splashing a bit of cash this summer.",null,0,null,1429154270,null,0,false,0,cqdyhlm,null,t3_32jmd1,null,t1_cqdyhlm,null,t1_cqdtk37,null,null,null,1432418511,null,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1,null

null,false,MadArend,num20,,null,"Yeah, I've noticed you tend towards the pessimistic side in your appraisal of Pochettino.  Personally, I'm with you in that I think his tactical ""consistency"" is largely a matter of stubbornness, and I would like him to be more flexible, but I do think the other explanation has at least some traction here as well.  Also, I don't think he's quite as stubborn as AVB.  Occasionally he gets so experimental that we all end up scratching our heads at his selection.  And on one occasion, it turned out great (Burnley) but mostly his occasional peculiar selections have netted out to very little difference.

There *are* two things that make me optimistic about Pochettino compared to AVB (and Sherwood), despite our inconsistency and frequent mediocre/poor results:

* I do think we've looked more fluid than we ever did under AVB.  Other than the past couple of matches, we've had much better passing and penetration than we did at any point under AVB other than the fall of 2013 (when we had Bale, Lennon, a settling Dempsey, an in-form Defoe, and a Dembele-Sandro midfield duo that was literally the best in the league).  And I also think that the team has improved in this respect over the course of the season, last 2-3 matches excluded.

* The matches against Chelsea and Woolwich.  Forget the results, the team straight-up played better in those two matches than it has at any point since Modric left.  So Pochettino in 8 months has shown glimpses of achieving a level that AVB never came close to in his 16 months.  That Chelsea-Woolwich-Liverpool gauntlet was brutal, we were still inconsistent (Leicester and Palace results), and now we're running out of gas ... but ""holy shit"" results like the demolition of Chelsea will do wonders for the squad next season, I think.

On the question of bringing in players, you and I are making complementary arguments.  Better scouting would help us improve; so would CL qualification.  Scouting gets us players like Dier, Kane, and arguably Bale ... UCL gets us players like Rafa and Griezmann, and arguably helps us keep players like Modric.  Ultimately, we need and want both factors, but each one on its own will help us improve the squad.",null,0,null,1429159564,null,0,false,0,cqe18fj,null,t3_32k44w,null,t1_cqe18fj,null,t1_cqdrnr9,null,null,null,1432419805,null,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2,null
null,false,FullFrontalAlchemist,null,null,null,"I was more curious instead of unsure about Sherwood's appointment. Like many, I watched and learned as much as I could about Tim. Though Spurs fans' opinions initially concerned me, I quickly shook them off.

Here is my personal run-down of Tim Sherwood so far:

* He quickly inspired the supporters and the team

This is the biggest and most impressive thing Sherwood has done for me. After years of Lambertian football (and the garbage before it), getting the fans and team to believe we have the talent to not only stay up, but also possibly jump into the top of the table in the near future, is no small feat.

* He seems to be great with the players and ushering in young talent

In our financial situation this is invaluable. With Tim I believe we can keep (most of) the players we want to keep, and get talent on the team without dishing out money we don't have.

* I am again excited to watch my favorite team play

Watching the Villa the past two years has probably also taken two years off my life span. Already, I am less stressed and more excited about watching Villa play (not to say our position hasn't been stressful now, but it's a part of the game instead of pretty much the whole game).

Of course there are areas I'm not sure about, but regardless, I believe Tim Sherwood has been a step in the right direction for Aston Villa.

Drug policy - Legalise cannabis. This will create jobs, collect millions in taxes, and reduce spending in regards to the PSNI investigating/arresting non-violent drug users/dealers. This will also of course reduce the number of non-violent drug users/dealers going to jail.

I was so flipping excited about AVB's second season in charge and all our new signings... I think nowadays I just try to inoculate myself against the shock of being disappointed, hah!

I am pretty genuinely bothered by Poch though.  The Chelsea and Arsenal games were genuinely great games.  Absolutely no caveats there.  We played well, deserved the results, and Poch either got his approach right or got the players in the right mood.

But don't all teams usually get a couple of games like that in a whole season, where they play our of their skins and beat a big team?  Heck, even Leicester smashed a bunch past Utd earlier in the season.  Having literally just two great games, even as good as they were, actually feels *more* depressing in some ways, because it's like, how have we not managed to play this again?

In terms of Poch vs AVB, I would also point to AVB winning at Old Trafford and against City at home as a counter points.  They were just as good performances in my mind, especially as the former was whilst Ferguson was still in charge (winning at OT has become passé now, but it was fucking huge for us at the time), and City were chasing the title and we were chasing top 4.  It's the exact kind of game we normally capitulate in.  I feel on here people tend to forget that AVB's first season was pretty good... over-reliant on Bale, yes, but we literally finished one point off fourth in our manager's first season.

In any case, time will tell.  Poch may get us absolutely firing next season and I'll eat my words... and I'll happily do so!  I'm all for supporting the club, but I also feel it's worthwhile being real about where things are at, and I don't think by any stretch of the imagination we can call this a decent season save for the emergence of Kane.

null,false,MadArend,num20,,null,"AVB's victories over the Manchester clubs in 2012/13 were exactly what I thought of, too.  But we really were better in this season's victories over Chelsea and Woolwich.

The win over United 2012 was soooo fantastic.  But we didn't dominate them, we got opportunistic and then managed to barely hold on.  That's no mean feat at Old Trafford against a Ferguson-coached side that ran away with the league title, for sure.  But this season, we *owned* a Mourinho-coached Chelsea side that is also running away with the league title, in the process setting a record for goals against Mourinho in the PL.  That's on another level.  And for me, no, Leicester (a decent but unlucky side, by some accounts) smashing an out-of-sorts-and-playing-like-shit-for-a-new-manager United side doesn't compare.  Honestly, I don't think any team outside the current top 4 has had a performance this season to compare with our demolition of Chelsea.  It was the absolute talk of the town, and it made the whole league look at Spurs and say, ""Whoa ... these guys might be a serious threat.""  And then we lost to Palace. :/

Against Man City in spring of '13, we had a 7 great minutes.  They were *great*, but they were only 7.  To be fair, though, it showed the one respect in which I think AVB was superior to Pochettino: substitutions.  Then again, maybe out-smarting Roberto Mancini isn't *that* much of an accomplishment?

It's funny you mention the collective amnesia about AVB's first season.  Everyone always focuses on his second season, and I often feel like the lone voice saying ""Hey, we were pretty darn good in AVB's first season!""  Glad to know I'm not alone.  And in reality, we were only reliant on Bale for the last third of the season or so.  It's just that were were *really* reliant on him.

&gt; Having literally just two great games, even as good as they were, actually feels more depressing in some ways, because it's like, how have we not managed to play this again?

...

&gt;  I don't think by any stretch of the imagination we can call this a decent season save for the emergence of Kane. But even that's tinged with a bit of sadness for me, because when you have a guy come along and score 30 goals for you, you expect to be a little bit better than 7th place.

Damn, dude, I think you could make a puppy cry. :-)

It's a hangover from an older period that was intended to illustrate the decline of the Roman Empire (the 'light'). A throwback to an older school of thought that saw the Roman Empire being 'overrun' by 'barbarians' as being an inherently bad thing.

&gt;The term once characterized the bulk of the Middle Ages, or roughly the 6th to 13th centuries, as a period of intellectual darkness between extinguishing the ""light of Rome"" after the end of Late Antiquity, and the rise of the Italian Renaissance in the 14th century. This definition is still found in popular use, but increased recognition of the accomplishments of the Middle Ages has led to the label being restricted in application. Since the 20th century, it is frequently applied to the earlier part of the era, the Early Middle Ages (c. 5th–10th century).However, many modern scholars who study the era tend to avoid the term altogether for its negative connotations, finding it misleading and inaccurate for any part of the Middle Ages.

It's generally considered poor form to use the term 'Dark Ages' in scholarly conversation, instead you can use the terms Early Middle Age, Middle Age and High Middle age (which is then of course proceeded by the Renaissance).

I also think the tax bands need some work, you could introduce one more band for instance, especially if you want to increase the top end.

Wealth tax makes sense &amp; is basically the only way we can redistribute wealth effectively. Linking it to NI makes sense as they have no idea how much ££ it will raise. 

Personally I think inheritance tax should be higher than it is to promote either spending it before you die or giving it away earlier. Their idea about spreading the wealth more makes sense though. I wonder what they would do wrt to houses though, these laws would make handing over assets like that very difficult unless you don't pay tax until they're sold.

null,false,chilari,eng-shropshire,Shropshire,null,"Allowing businesses to discriminate against people on the basis of race, gender, sexuality etc is about the rights of the buyer, not the seller. If the business had the right to discriminate, and used that right, then there would be certain groups who would, as a result of something they're born with, are stuck paying over the odds for the same things. Picture this scenario:

Many businesses in your town discriminate against people who fit into your demographic. Some of those businesses refuse to serve you, some just charge you more than they charge other people. Think ""Barbers. £5 basic buzzcut, £8 if you're /u/fullingtwo's demographic."" You dont have a choice but to pay £3 extra for the haircut, because the other barbers either won't cut your hair at all or do the same thing. The supermarket closest to your home won't serve you at all, so you need to get a bus or drive to a supermarket a few miles away instead, meaning that your expenses for a supermarket trip go up by a few quid, and the trip takes 30 minutes longer. So you've got less time to work on your professional qualification in the evening - a professional qualification that your company only pays for 80% of the costs of, whereas your colleages of other demographics get funding covering 100%. And while we're talking about your job, you're getting paid 10% less than the person hired the same day, with the same qualifications and experience, doing the same job, just because of your demographic, because it's perfectly legal to do that.

The result is, you get paid less and your pay doesn't go as far because you've got to pay more for services or you've got to travel further to get to them. Solely on the basis of your gender, race, sexuality, whatever. And the result of that is that you have fewer opportunities to increase your earning potential - less time to study, less funding to cover course expenses, etc. Your mental health is probably poorer, because you've got more money stresses and you're regularly getting less sleep, so you're more stressed and less alert at work.

Now let's say you're in a relationship with someone who is not discriminated against, but you want to break it off because they're becoming controlling and violent. You can't get a bank account in your own name without them there, so you can't lay the groundwork for getting out. You can't seek help from shelters because of your demographic, they just won't help you. You can't buy essential supplies to help you get out of that abusive relationship, because you don't have the time to travel to the nearest shop that will serve you. So you're stuck in this abusive relationship, because discrimination by businesses means you can't get the things you need to escape it.

And all this is because businesses can discriminate. Even if they can only discriminate against customers, and not staff or in hiring practices, it still stands - there's still the problem of those who get discriminated against having to travel further or pay more for the same service.

Now, sure, this is a fairly dystopic scenario. You might think it's farfetched, it won't happen. It has happened, within the last century. Racism, sexism, homophobia haven't been defeated and wiped out. In some areas, maybe not all, but in some areas a business will take its right to discriminate and run with it. And sure, in many of those cases good people in the area will be ""well, that's not on"" and boycott any business that acts like that. But a lot of people won't bother to take action, or will make excuses for not taking action (it's the most convenient shop, I don't have time to go to the next nearest, I don't know where there's another shop that sells this item) and continue spending money with such unethical businesses. And the result is that certain people in certain areas will get caught up in that situation, stuck, unable to do anything about it, because it's al perfectly legal.

I saw all the games he played in and he was best as CM in a 3-man midfield with De Jong playing CDM. Didn't work out well when Essien played CDM because Essien fucking sucks (now).

He also played CDM in friendlies, thought he was good, and deserved to play there in official matches ahead of Muntari and Essien.

Also played few times in double anchor with Poli but that didn't work out at all.

He doesn't try anything outrageous, but compared to other Milan midfielders, his passing is pretty fast and tight, he's one of rare players who press the opponents. Had some nice backheels and link up play in attack, but overall offensively he should improve. And reduce the backpassing a bit. Think he's still tiny bit scared of nasty tackles due to being injured twice in Milan already after already being out for months while in Chelsea.

Anyway, he played full time in last 4 matches and there's no reason to drop him now even if captain Montolivo comes back.

I heard some rumors of his loan being extended, but that probably comes down to whether Milan gets sold to the Chinese and whether Inzaghi stays as coach.",null,0,null,1429175013,null,0,false,0,cqe5q6i,null,t3_32ruaz,null,t1_cqe5q6i,null,t3_32ruaz,null,null,null,1432421994,null,6,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,6,null

I actually get my gas and electricity through [The Co-operative Energy](https://www.cooperativeenergy.coop/), so if you'd like to see co-operatively owned energy, that's the place to start!

Re: the cuts, the thing that annoys me is that five years ago, everyone on the left - me included - was invoking Keynes and saying you shouldn't cut during a recession, you should invest: If you cut, you'll kill the recovery. I feel history has proved us right on that one. But now, most of the left has completely forgotten Keynes and is insisting that we keep throwing money around and borrowing now that growth, however anaemic, has returned. Keynes would categorically not support that. He'd be arguing that now is the time to pay down government debts and allow the private sector to invest.

Obviously I don't mind disagreement, but the intellectual inconsistency of using one set of arguments when they suit you then throwing them away once they don't is infuriating. The SNP are making absolute hay out of all the Labour activists/voters who are grumbling about austerity, so it has political consequences, too.

Anyway, that's why I agree with you and Chuka!

The same can apply to people with certain mental health issues too. Trans people, and especially non-binary people, are expected to ""prove"" they need the healthcare (including hormone treatments and surgeries) for long periods of time before they are prescribed them, which has a serious negative effect on their mental health (because (a) the doctor doesn't believe them and (b) they're forced to act in and dress as a certain gender stereotype in order to access healthcare, when the gender stereotype isn't how they feel about their body and is as harmful as the one they're trying to transition from.

The Anglican Cathedral is the largest in Britain.

The Metropolitan has crypt under it from a previous attempt at building a cathedral on the site that a lot of people don't know about, in a different style to the 'wig wam'. 

The docks are nicest at night, a lot more scenic then. Visit during the day though if you'd like to visit the Tate. Don't go to the Beatles museum there, it's awful. 

The Everyman Theatre is on Hope St, opposite the Metropolitan Cathedral, and is an interesting marvel inside. It was previously in an old church building, but when rejuvenating it they knocked that down. They kept all the bricks though, and they're all used and kept exposed in the theatre's rebuild. It won the Stirling prize last year, which is the UK's most prestigious architecture prize. 
 
FACT, on the street behind Bold St, always has some form of free gallery on. The cinema there is nice, less noise and more actually watching the film than at the Odeon. Downstairs there's a small cinema called The Box, which just has 12 or so sofas - it's quite intimate.. Check what you can see while you're visiting.

Depends how soon you're coming, but the Bombed Out Church (St Luke's) at the top of Bold St is worth a tale but usually boring to visit.. Except for very soon, as Bonobo is playing in it(!!). 

Everything in the Bluecoat, which is the oldest building in the centre of Liverpool, is interesting. 

Nook &amp;amp; Cranny is a quirky little arts, crafts and prints store. Visit it on Bold St, it's pretty different.

For food, as others have mentioned there's a lot on Bold St. You'll see the quirky ones if you walk up and down, Kasbah etc. A couple I'll point out there or elsewhere though:
- Leaf is on Bold St awesome. Spacious tea house that is just simply *nice*. Really cosy place, it's usually busy throughout the day and night. The tea is great, the food is good although the menu is small, and the vibes are brilliant. Often has live music. 
- Bold St Coffee is where you want to go if you like great coffee, though it's a daytime venture. 
- Go to TriBeCa if you like pizza. Seriously, it's so good and it's honestly priced. Never taken anyone who didn't love it. Gogo. 
- Lunya does real nice Catalan/Portuguese food, in Liverpool ONE. 
- Byron Burgers is a chain and also in Liverpool ONE, but if you've never been, the place is class. Fantastic burgers. Beats Almost Famous for me which is another great shout. 

There are some quirky shops on Bold St too, but I dunno where else you'd like off the top of my head. Check out Quiggans, there's tonnes of weird stuff there, from alternative fashion to stuff like a retro games store. It's in an ornate building. 

There's a Banksy at Rumsford St car park, Love Plane. 

Lastly, if you want a giggle, go to the Victoria statue opposing the Crown Courts just above Liverpool ONE. Stand directly to her left (Simon Says style) at the bottom of the steps, and she'll look like she's holding something surprising.

null,false,Froolow,null,null,null,"I found the [following data](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/household-income/the-effects-of-taxes-and-benefits-on-household-income/historical-data--1977-2011-12/summary--historical-data--1977-2011-12.html) from the ONS.

They reckon the top decile pays 35% of all direct taxes (such as income tax) and 18% of all indirect taxes (VAT, fuel duty etc). the works out as 28% of all taxes overall.

The top three deciles pay 57% of total tax take, the top five deciles pay 76%. So on that measure, you're absolutely right.

That isn't a completely useful way to look at it though, because some people are paying non-direct tax on money which was given to them by a redistributive benefit system. In other words the above assumes if I pay £80 in tax to you then you pay £20 VAT on a purchase with that money that I have paid £80 and you have paid £20 (for a 4:1 split), when in fact the treasury only actually took £100 of money in, of which it redistributed £80 and kept the other 20% as a 'VAT surcharge'

So looking at total tax paid - benefit transfers, we see that the top decile pays an absolute majority or near majority of tax (depending on how you calculate how the benefits are paid), and only the top 60% of earners are net contributors, with the top 40% of earners contributing &gt;90% of the total tax take.

So I don't think the data strongly backs up your point - even if the top decile doesn't *technically* pay an absolute majority of all tax, it is only because they're pay 48% of tax and you're calculating the way transfers work in the most advantageous way for your argument. Although the less progressive taxes do balance out the total tax load somewhat, it is still not enough to eliminate the fact that our system is essentially propped up by the super-rich.",null,0,null,1429179567,null,0,false,0,cqe6o77,null,t3_32sayh,null,t1_cqe6o77,null,t1_cqe6ebj,null,null,null,1432422438,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

Dyson is a truely great man, but he's not exactly a Ghengis Khan figure who makes money by inspiring fear in his enemies and running his company like a branch of the Cosa Nostra - the only reason he is able to make a billion pounds is - for example - the fact the Patent Office protect his designs, and the fact he didn't catch cholera when he was five thanks to Public Health England, and the fact that one of his engineers had a breakthrough thanks to a discussion she had with a tutor during her free university education, and the fact his cleaners could get to work every morning because they can use the underground at a subsidised rate and don't need to worry about their home being robbed or burned down because of a publicly funded police force / fire department. If society collapsed tomorrow, I have no doubt that it would be the very marginal in society who made out best (at least in terms of the relative decline in standards of living).

Have done this ever since we moved in together both unmarried and married. No legal agreement although this may or may not be a good thing but see later. We both own the house in joint names, we both pay towards the bills and mortgage. As her wages are paid into her account monthly, every month she just asks me how much I want and transfers it over. I usually do it so she keeps a few hundred quid. As both of our jobs are seasonal when the wife has little work I end up paying more and when I have little work she pays more and in those cases when I'm quiet I'll ask her for what she earned less any bills she has and when I'm busy and she's not earning much I'll ask for nothing. Neither of us think of the money we earn exclusively as our own. All household bills come first then if we want anything we can get it with whats left. Once the account gets to a certain level we both transfer a chunk into our ISAs. The reason she has her own account is because when we tried it as one single joint account she was a bugger for not spending money when she wanted something even though there was plenty in the account so I did it that way so she would spend some.  Must be working as we have plenty in the bank and a second house despite a joint household income only £5k above the national average. 

If we split up, owning two houses the decision is simple. She'll stay here with our autistic son in the largest house, I'll get the smaller one we rent out. Don't really care about what has what equity in it. We'd probably split the joint account some way or another. I can't see a problem as we never argue about money.

This works for us. Its been a solution that works for us that has grown of its own accord. I won't pretend it will work for everyone. It depends a lot on the selfishness of the individuals in regards to the money they earn.

On the other hand everyone I know who uses single accounts with you pay this and I pay that has one or the other partner financially in the shit because what happens is one will have a drop in income and is still expected to pay their bits even though they don't have enough money and their partner earns more than enough. A close neighbour took it to the extent that they ended up in court fighting an eviction for their rented house being in arrears by £1000s and it wasn't the first time. She hadn't enough money to pay the bills and he had £100s a week spare. Fucking crazy. Best friend and his missus are in the same boat. She has to pay the shopping etc out of tax credits, he just pays the mortgage out of his wages. She's got a few quid in her bank if she wants to get something, he has £1000s.

Compare say, the stance on private property to a small communist village in Spain where the cost of a mortgage is 15 euro's a month provided you don't use your home for private profit (ie. rent it or sell it) and you get a lot closer to the actual cost of what a home's real term cost is. And it's not as if this village is living in mud huts and Tee-pees. Their housing is as modern as anything Britain is producing.

He wasn't arrested for quoting Winston Churchill, from the article, ""Mr. Weston was subsequently arrested for religious harassment when he did not comply with officers’ orders to leave the area"". He wasn't arrested for saying anything, he was arrested for refusing to move on after he had caused a fuss. The context for this is that Paul Weston has a history of racism and incendiary remarks. This is a man linked to the BNP, the EDL and BFP (who are now in alliance with the EDL). Has previously said things such as ""the 21st Century, unless things change, will see the virtual extinction of my white European race"".

Instead let's have a look at Marinaleda, Spain  where they have abolished private property - where they went very far to the left after the dictator that imposed Capitalism on Spain, Franco, starved their village in the 1970's for civil disobedience. As a spoiler, their mortgages are 15 euro's a month for a modern home.

&gt;The houses — some 350 units in total, with twenty new builds underway at the time of our visit — become part of a housing cooperative. Needless to say, when citizens are only left paying €15 per month for mortgages, this has a massive knock-on impact on work requirements.

&gt;When many young people think about making their first foray into the housing market, money is inevitably the biggest obstacle. State of the economy aside, a down payment is always a sizable sum, even in relatively tame markets, and is increasingly unattainable for what has been described as ‘the jilted generation.’

&gt;But high on the list of maverick decisions spearheaded by Mayor Sánchez Gordillo, using a combination of state housing subsidy for building materials, free labor for construction and land given by the town, housing has been partly removed from the free market in Marinaleda. Instead, community members come together with architectural plans provided by the council to build a block of houses, with no sense in advance which home will belong to which family.

In my opinion if someone owns a football club, any money they put into it should be seen an investment, not a loan which they can ask to be repaid. At the end of the day whether it's in a company name of the owner's name, it is still THEIR business. If their investment fails, that's their fault. I don't see how it's ethical or moral for them then to ask for the money back if their investment fails.

I just want to add as well that this makes me really really angry. I love football but the system that is currently in place right now only protects the interests of the owners, not the fans or the club itself. I'm sorry to say guys but until this changes, football will always be screwed.

So the issue, as you have pointed out, is to do with enforcement. There are laws and fines in place for cyclists who jump lights etc already. The trouble is we are utterly unable to enforce them. For instance did you know it's actually illegal for a cyclist to ride at night without proper lights on their bike:
https://www.gov.uk/rules-for-cyclists-59-to-82/overview-59-to-71

You tell me which you see more of, cyclists riding at night without lights or cyclists being pulled over by the police.

Whilst I do agree that helmets should be compulsory I can see more things like this happening as well:
http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/police-officer-threatens-confiscate-4-year-old-5304014

There were also some reports, from autopsies, that a Transsexual's brain does more closely resemble that of the other gender (men &amp; women apparently have different densities in different regions of the brain *shrug*) so the old line of ""I'm a man trapped in a woman's body"" (or vice versa) may actually be spot on in the case of a Transsexual.

""Senior"" does of course require experience, but it doesn't just mean ""has more experience"" - experience is necessary but not sufficient. Senior roles usually involve more than just being better at implementing stuff. ""Senior"" people will typically be more involved in specifying the work in the first place, estimating the time required, planning how you get from concept to execution to delivery including all the dependencies on things like suppliers, other parts of the company etc. They're usually involved in hiring (and sometimes firing, although that's more often left to management) decisions, help new employees (no matter how experienced) find their way around the projects they'll be working on, and mentor less experienced colleagues.

There are many who won't earn over the threshold for even the first 5 years of graduating under the new system.

Unless you are a graduate in high demand such as Engineering, Comp Sci, Chemistry etc, you are just not likely to ever pay it off.

I graduated 4 years ago in Engineering, and despite the lower threshold, meaning I pay back more due to the old system, as well as the amount I have to pay off being smaller, I have still paid off less than 5% of my student loan.

My wife who graduated in history at the same time as me only made her first repayment in the last few months.

We've had the exact scenario you describe. My other half is a contractor, having left games dev after almost 15 years in the industry. About this time last year he wasn't even sure he could make the mortgage payments due to the way he was paid by the company he was contracting for (second class postal cheques rather than bank transfers, one of which got lost in the post and needed replacing), so I set aside some money to cover them as needed. He'd already stored up savings/bonuses etc from his time in industry to last about a year, but by that point had been operating for a couple of years, living extremely frugally (he didn't want to have to feel like he was living off me), and not getting his expected payment on time nearly tipped his finances over the edge. 

Conversely, way back when he graduated but I was still a student, he helped me out with some bills, rent and treats.

Firstly, the BBC do not ""always have some bozo on denying climate change in the name of fairness and balance"" perhaps 10 years ago they did, but these days its rare.

Secondly, proportional to what?

 If you look at the 2010 general election, UKIP got 3% of the vote and 0 MPs. The Green Party got .9% of the vote.

Let's make our first assumption and assume by proportional we mean proportional to the number of votes cast in the last election, rather than the number of seats held. 

That means of course than any new party can never get any coverage, but setting that aside

Let's take the 90 minute debate between all the candidates. That would mean that Nigel Farage would get 2.5 minutes to talk, compared David Cameron's 29 minutes and the Greens would get 53 seconds.

Does that sound like a healthy way to conduct a democratic process? 

Aha! you might say ""that's so dumb - clearly you should take into consideration, more recent polling and at least give smaller parties enough airtime to set out their broad policies so that voters are aware of them"". And I'd agree with you - and I think that's what the BBC attempts. But it isn't proportional, it tends to even out the time given to different views.

But you didn't, you've known something wasn't quite right with your reflection and how you were expected to interact with the world since a very early age.  This discontinuity became much worse when you went through puberty and all the other girls developed differently to you. 

&gt; I mean they could have different brains or whatever but changing your gender surely wouldn't fix that would it?

First separate gender from sex.  Consider gender to be what's in your head and sex to be what's between your legs (and on your chest), it makes things easier.  Your gender is set by that mental self image. 

But fix is the wrong word, it implies a cure or finality to the problem.  Even post-operative Transsexuals get issues from the condition, however the surgery (and all other steps that are undertaken) are to make the condition easier to manage.

The reason for this is that a lot of the price of a house is the 'status' it brings - especially once you get off the very floor of the housing ladder. If Russians are occupying all the best houses, Brits *could* buy up all the best-but-one houses (displacing other Brits into best-but-two houses) or they could invest the extra money into other kinds of status symbols - cars or artwork, for example.

I'd be interested in seeing some evidence either way, but my feeling is that so much 'energy' is lost from the system between levels that nothing that happens at the top matters much at the bottom, as long as the number of super-wealthy individuals remains reasonably low compared to the number of normally-wealthy individuals",null,0,null,1429186963,null,0,false,0,cqe8ob1,null,t3_32sayh,null,t1_cqe8ob1,null,t1_cqe8igs,null,null,null,1432423381,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

If people shunned thieves (which most people would readily do if thieves were readily identifiable), then this wouldn't stop them. If anything, thievery would increase, owing to the people concerned being ostracised from normal society.

Granted there's more than a share of ignorant sectarian boneheads in loyalism, but one can also think of better representatives (David Irvine, Gary McMichael, possibly even Jackie McDonald on his more enlightened days). 

I think however there is also a general perspective of defeat and/or suppression of what they consider to be their culture (whether that's justified or not is another question, it *is* they way they feel about it and express it) when it comes to banned parades, removed flags and symbols, and lack of enquiries and truth processes that afflicted their community. Meanwhile new Republican statues, parades, commemorations, plaques and even play parks (!) go up without seeming to bother an iota of the powers and quangos that be. One might see where the resentment is coming from - without necessarily having to agree with the reasoning made.

All of this fuels a wider isolation from Stormont politics, the ""peace process"" and civic society.

People like Malachi O'Doherty have written a bit more fairly on this.

I've taken legal highs and they're absolutely fucking horrible but I'm actively opposed to banning them. Legalisation and education is really the only way to approach it and if people still want to do it and it goes wrong I'll hand over the Darwin Award myself.

By banning drugs like this outright we're basically saying that that society owns people, not just metaphorically but physically, society owns you because it can tell you what to what you can or can't ingest. We don't have much autonomy in the world but at the very least we should own the right to do what we want with our own bodies for better or worse.

I understand young people are vulnerable and that's probably the major argument in support of making substances illegal but unfortunately, and this is going to sound harsh, parents are just going to have to deal with it. If parents don't agree with something or don't want their kids doing something that's totally fine, they can raise their children with whatever values they want, but when they try to impose those values on society as whole and justify it by playing the vulnerable child card is when we have a problem. Having kids is hard work, really hard work but the onus falls on parents to impose their own moral or social limits rather than it being the making it the responsibility of the wider community.

This is a pretty bad example for that because the guy is being kind of a dick and it's more of a fringe case.

When a white person uses it, they're a group that would have in recent history used it to oppress and subjugate the group it targets. People using it within the group it targets is different because that power difference has never been there. It's especially distasteful to use it while there still exists a (albeit markedly different) level of inequality.

So once we've established that, it's not a huge leap to make it comparable (although it becomes more of a fringe thing). When someone calls a white person cracker, which is another racial slur, that word doesn't have the context of recent history or the inequalities that has left behind.

It largely is, there are very few arguments that when it comes down the crux of the economics of it actually hold up as bad for the UK. Maybe a Polish person has come in and taken your job, but who gives a crap about you, the country as a whole is better off having immigration, and if your job can be done by unskilled labour for cheaper, maybe you should have worked harder in school. Not to mention that currently a lot of semi-skilled labour, i.e. plumbers, carpenters, electricians and are very highly paid, for a job that while does take some training, isn't that hard, it isn't like being a Doctor, Engineer, Software developer.

This is due to lack of supply of labour, even with immigration, imagine how bad it would be otherwise, you would be paying plumbers £100K a year just to get one to come to your house.

The problem isn't immigration, it is a lack of high skilled jobs for the aspiring British workers, this means they are stuck working at Bars, in Supermarkets, in generic offices, with specialist degrees that have just gone to waste because the government isn't willing to invest in high skilled engineering, science, maths and computer science. They are who are taking your jobs, people smarter than you, who should be doing better with their lives but can't because there is no opportunity too, these project cost millions to run, there is no lets just start our own business aspect.

Of course there are going to be some points when taken alone are bad for the UK, and that is the case for everything, having a well funded NHS means you pay more in tax, that is the realities of life, but overall no one who isn't an idiot is making the argument that on balance EU membership isn't a solid net gain.",null,0,null,1429188931,null,0,false,0,cqe9eku,null,t3_32s7t9,null,t1_cqe9eku,null,t1_cqe8z2r,null,null,null,1432423725,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

The Conservatives have continued to spin their familiar yarn of having rescued Britain from ‘Labour’s Great Recession’. This, as they must know, is the mother of all lies The Great Recession was caused by the banks. Governments, the Labour government included, by bailing out the banks and continuing to spend, stopped the Great Recession from turning into a Great Depression. Yet practically everyone seems to believe that the Great Recession was manufactured by Gordon Brown.
 
&gt;The Conservatives claim that ‘by halving the deficit we have restored confidence to the economy’. This cheerfully ignores the near academic consensus that their deficit-reduction policies over the last 5 years have made the British economy between 5 and 10% smaller than it would have been with more sensible policies.
 
&gt;According to the Conservative manifesto ‘more borrowing – and the extra debt interest that brings – means that there is less money to spend on schools and hospitals’. But if less borrowing reduces the size of the economy – and therefore of government revenues – there will be even less to spend on schools and hospitals.
 
&gt;‘More spending means higher taxes for hardworking people’ – not if it causes the economy to grow more than the spending.
Failure to control the national debt would be a ‘moral failing’ by ‘leaving our children or grandchildren with debts that they could never hope to repay’. How many people realise that over 60% of the holders of British government debt are British residents, for whom it will be an asset to leave to their children and grandchildren?
 
&gt;The Conservative narrative has become the Overton Window of our day, outside of which policies are unthinkable.

I then pointed out that *this particular argument* applies equally well to other laws, such as stealing and murder (which it does), and so is a silly reason to dislike them.

Even if market forces would work, the process *at best* is slow and offers no individual protection to consumers who are at risk of being discriminated against in any instance that it happens. And besides, it's obvious that it wouldn't always work since the existence of discriminatory businesses in the first place already demonstrates that a certain segment of the population is okay with discrimination.

And further, even disregarding those issues, if market forces not only worked but were actually quite effective at fighting discrimination, so what? Every now and then discrimination would still pop up, so what benefit could possibly be derived from scrapping the laws?

The more damaging political swing is Labour voters turning Tory. So if anything Miliband being to the right of the SNP, Plaid and the Greens might warm some Tory voters to Labour.

These measures are present for several reasons. Firstly, because eliminating risky parts of the donor pool is the most effective way to prevent infected blood from entering the supply chain. We do screen batches of blood (several donations pooled, then tested together - and each individually tested if there is a positive), but no test is 100%. Therefore, risk prevention is taken at every step of the way.

Yes, sadly by simply being gay your risk is higher. You may hate being told that, but it's the trust. It's not simply about YOU though. You date other gay guys, who are also statistically way more likely to be HIV+ than a random straight member of the UK public. That's one reason why HIV is so much more prevalent within the gay community, because you're sharing the same dating pool. You could turn up with a fresh certificate, but it still wouldn't show if you had very recently contracted HIV - which again is more likely because of being gay. 

And as I said, if I just got back from Thailand then I also couldn't donate. They even prevent previous transfusion recipients from donating. It's the same reason we don't pay for donations - because it would attract more risky people.

I don't mean to offend anyone as I know this is a touchy subject for many. But the way I'm seeing you describe it, I'm struggling to see how it's not a mental issue. You mention it's when someone mentally doesn't assoicate with their physical gender and could be sorted through changing their brain chemistry, a fix which could also apply to mental illnesses, if they could medically figure out how to do it? 

I can understand why a trans person wouldn't want it to be attached to the mental illness label as our current society has put such a huge stigma on mental illnesses. People with Depression are often told to just ""get over it"" so I can see how a trans person basically being told the same thing can be harmful. So surely it's a problem of awareness and how society percieves it then simply reclassifying it as a disorder to something that isn't a mental illness?

If someone can clarify that'll be great as I'm willing to learn more about the subject.",null,0,null,1429190539,null,0,false,0,cqea35i,null,t3_32rvoo,null,t1_cqea35i,null,t1_cqe79di,null,null,null,1432424046,null,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7,null

She is probably quoting it (i can't tell because the article didn't include a link to her twitter post,  just a picture) and sharing what she thinks is a funny post. The toast often satirises what people think feminism is like by taking it to a silly extreme.  Read the ""its 2050 and the feminists have won"" post for an example. 

What's happened here is that idiots looking for an issue have taken her quoting a satire website out of context. She even links to the site in her tweet.  The least people could have done is actually click the link to see what she was tweeting about. 

The other tweet is also taken out of context.  It was clearly a reply to another tweet.  ""kill all men **that do that**"" is what she said,  not ""kill all men."" as this article claims. It is commonly used hyperbole to say something like that. EDIT: I found the full tweet, it continues ""kill all men who do that,  in fact scrap the second half."" I think she needs some training on how twitter is not the best place to use sarcastic hyperbole.

A spousal veto is the non-trans partner's ability to veto an already established marriage (be it hetero or homosexual) changing to the other kind of marriage upon issue of a GRC (Gender Reassignment Certificate).

So, in an example, Amy and Brian get married, Brian is awarded a GRC, Amy has the ability to prevent the marriage from continuing under the new, same-sex relationship.

I don't see a problem with this in principle, the only real argument against it is that it's unnecessary as it takes 2 years (plenty of time to initiate divorce) before a GRC can be issued, and presumably the partners in a marriage would be fully aware of their partner's feelings. I still however, think it's a good thing to have in the event the restrictions of the time frame for a GRC are severely reduced. I also think it's good as a ""last opportunity"" threshold for the non-trans partner to decide whether or not they're happy for the marriage to continue.

What I don't get is the strong opposition to this really. It used to be that a spouse could prevent the other from obtaining a GRC, which is patently unfair, but the new rule seems to be balancing. The trans partner can unilaterally seek to amend the marriage arrangement, it makes sense that the other has the ability to decline that this occurs.

If I've misunderstood what the spousal veto is, please tell me, but if I'm right, I think it could be argued that this is akin to a human right of the non-trans person to be able to select who they are married to.",null,0,null,1429190687,null,0,false,0,cqea5mr,null,t3_32rvoo,null,t1_cqea5mr,null,t1_cqe73lf,null,null,null,1432424079,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

null,false,catdoctor,null,null,null,"I could not possibly disagree more. I LOVE the fact that The Doctor needed time to get over the woman he loved, unlike characters in so many other TV shows who mourn at the end of the episode and then never think of their ""loved one"" ever again.   
The writer of this article, and many participants on this sub, would have preferred for The Doctor to have moved on from Rose much more quickly. The fact that The Doctor remembered Rose,  mourned her loss, and was not able to move on quickly simply shows the strength of his love for her. It would minimize The Doctor's connection with Rose if he was able to simply forget her in a couple of episodes, making him seem shallow.      
Think about Star Trek TOS, where Kirk seems to fall in love every other week and in future episodes does not ever seem to remember the woman he ""loved"" so recently. Contrast that, for example, with the episode where Picard lives a whole life in his mind, and gets married. For the rest of the series run, Picard keeps the flute he learned to play as a keepsake. He never forgets that love, that family and that life. He does not ""fall in love"" again a month later. Yet I have never heard a Star trek fan complain the Picard should just move on and forget about that event. And Picard comes across as more sincere and more mature that Kirk ever did (for this, and many other reasons).   
Also, we see The Doctor go into exile for a long time after he loses Amy and Rory, who were friends but not a romantic involvement. Arguably, Rose meant a lot more to The Doctor than they did, as she was the person who helped him cope after he ended the Time War.  And yet I have never heard anyone complain that The Doctor needed a substantial amount of time to get over this loss.    
As for The Doctor's treatment of Martha: I don't think he treated her badly. He treated her the way people treat others after a break-up. He was very nice to her and took her on great adventures but was not able to open up to her or reciprocate her love. In fact, he sometimes seemed to not even notice. I would argue that he DID notice, but he didn't want to explicitly talk about it, because then he would have had to explicitly reject her, which would have caused her to leave sooner. The Doctor was selfish because he liked Martha and needed a companion. Is this the right approach? Probably not. But it's a very, very common dynamic.    
And, finally, I loved that the romantic dynamic between Martha and The Doctor resulted in Martha's departure. It made me love and admire Martha even more. I've lived long enough to have watched many, many people hang their hearts on a person who is never going to love them back, and waste years of their lives in the so-called ""friend zone"" hoping against hope that the other person will change his/her mind. Martha was strong enough to face the music. She realized that 
The Doctor would never love her back and she moved on. She took what she learned from her travels with him and turned it into a career with UNIT. And, eventually, she found another strong man who lived a life of adventure (the new-and-improved Mickey) and had a relationship with someone who COULD commit to her fully. Yeay for Martha!  THIS is how a strong woman deals with the problem. I think she is a wonderful role model for young people stuck in similar situations.",null,0,null,1429191019,null,0,false,0,cqeabct,null,t3_32so9m,null,t1_cqeabct,null,t3_32so9m,null,null,null,1432424154,null,28,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,28,null

My *health care manifesto* proposals

small additional levy added to either NI or Income tax that is named NHS support or something. It's difficult for the papers to slate a tax called NHS support (I'm sure the mail will find a way though)

Some sort of focus on preventive measures for obesity.

Short term: Adverts for anti obesity on a par with anti smoking ads, the current ones with the play dough kids are shit

 Long Term: Absolutely hammer school sports. Ensure that all schools have an all weather multipurpose field. Not something overly flash, just some rubber crum for football/rugby and a AstroTurf for hockey/netball. Make kids spend 4/5 hours a week playing sport, make it after school if you have to. This is easily the most expensive step in my plan. But if it only half's the rate of type 2 diabetes and other co-morbidities it'll pay for itself over time. Diabetes is about 10% of the NHS's running costs

Tax on sugary foods over a certain percentage, add them to VAT or something so nobody really notices/kicks off about it.

Increase pay slightly for doctors and nurses and recruit more. Too many wards are running on bare minimum staffing levels and using locums is inefficient.

Create much larger sheltered accommodation centres. Again expensive in the short term but it will get people off of wards freeing up beds.

Andrew Neil himself is fine, asking the right questions generally, but a lot of the show is him asking other people's opinions &amp; if you're purely talking to Tory or Labour supporters it tends to become a bit of a mouthpiece for party political commentary.

Give £1,000,000 to a rich person, and you immediately get £450,000 back in tax, because he pays the 45% marginal tax rate. He then sticks the whole thing in an offshore bank account and the Exchequer never sees it again (although if he sticks it in a UK bank account the money will provide liquidity for investment in various businesses, indirectly contributing to the employment of people making iPads and beer and crisps and stuff)

Give out 10,000 * £100 payouts and you get back no tax immediately (let's assume they all earn below the personal threshold). Those people go out and buy - let's say - 10,000 £100 iPads. Those are taxed at 20% VAT, so you get back £200,000 (I mean, the iPads cost £80, and 20% VAT is £20 (sort of) ). The rest of the £80 goes to Apple, which is an American company which pays virtually no tax in the UK. If we somehow imagine our way around the clever tax loopholes used by companies like Apple, corporation tax is only 20% of *profits*. Assume Apple makes nothing but profits, and it is therefore paying 20% on £80 - £16, or £160,000 in total. If Applie makes - say - 30% profit on iPads (which is a pretty ridiculously high amount for anyone but Apple to be making) the total tax is just £5, or £50,000 in total.

She bought maybe four times what I did to the table in terms of finance. Part way through the house-buying process there's a stage where we got to choose whether ownership of the house would be all in one name, split proportionally depending on input, or equally shared. I was careful not to put any pressure on the decision here - bringing less into the purchase I didn't want to set up any possible cause for resentment down the line - but she took about 6 seconds to decide to split it 50/50 and no amount of questioning was going to change that. This is the only legal or written agreement we have, regarding money. 

As it turned out, we were better off putting in a 30% deposit rather than anything larger, so we both still have some remaining savings - even me. We felt it was important we both had some individual funds, even though I contributed so much less. These savings are held in pre-marriage, pre-house individual accounts. Currently, our salaries are within £500 of each other, though I bring home less due to the ridiculous cost of Greater Anglia's terrible service and a work season-ticket loan agreement.

No, it's not. That's fucking bullshit. I was told I was high risk the first time I went to a clinic. I'd slept with one person. We were both virgins prior. We used protection. I was pretty much 0 risk.

Being gay isn't what spreads HIV. It doesn't magically appear in the blood of gays. The reason it's more common in gays is due to lack of education; many don't use condoms because pregnancy isn't a risk. It's nothing to do with sharing a dating pool; especially as the rule excludes all gay people not just those who are active within the gay community. 

And yeah, it might not be a right, but that doesn't mean it's okay to talk to gay people like their subhuman when it comes to issues like this.

I myself am Scottish, and many polish nationals have moved to the areas surrounding my hometown and University town for various reasons. I will warn you that regardless of where you go, there is an increasing level of hostility directed at polish and eastern europeans coming over here, exacerbated by the immigration fear gripping the country. That said, the large community of polish nationals is beginning to become more recognised (for example, polish food is sold in increasing levels across many major supermarkets) and hopefully, naturalisation will mean that this hostility will slowly ebb out.

Minimum wage is hardly what I'd call 'comfortable', several of my peers have spiraled into debt because they cannot afford to live on £6.50 an hour (if over 21-it drops depending on your age). I can almost guarantee you will not be able to save £500 a month if on the minimum wage. Many of the Polish nationals I know are highly skilled workers who work in the ship-building industry, and even they struggle from time to time.

The Care industry is one route I could recommend which will train you on the job and pay you the living wage (£7.65 an hour). Once you have the relevant qualifications, usually paid for by the company you're working with, you can expect to rise through the ranks and move to higher paid positions. It's not really an easy job, but if you're passionate and willing to work you should have no issues getting work.

The UK is not an easy life, poverty rates are increasing and living costs are inflating. There's a rift in British politics between the right and the left which is only getting wider. If the Political party UKIP gains power in Westminster, strict immigration sanctions are to be expected and huge restrictions on access to healthcare, welfare and the likes for anyone who is not a British national. I don't personally support their policies, but it seems a large number of people south of the border do.

Company owner (also an on-air personality) Vince McMahon storms out to sort things out. When sliding into the ring he tears his quad and awkwardly sits there presumably holding back the tears (I mean this in both senses, I guess). Match is restarted and Batista wins as planned.

However, it is my belief (since I'm not an economist) that by getting the economy going by giving people a bunch of money and getting them to spend it, more jobs will be created, and with that, a stronger middle class.

 As the middle class gets stronger and stronger, people have more and more money to spend, which takes them out of the dead zone where they aren't paying any tax and into the 22% or even the 40% tax brackets. In the short term, you wouldn't see much from that £1 million investment, but in the long term, you'd make up for that loss by the mixture of VAT and increased income tax from the strengthened middle class, as well as the taxes paid by companies that start up to fill the new market's needs. 

In short, I think giving the poor more money through whatever means (though I do prefer the 'give them a job to do' approach), will benefit the economy and raise the standard of living more in the long term than if the same amount of money were given to the rich in the form of tax cuts.

null,false,Froolow,null,null,null,"I was going to snark about how much the plan would cost (I reckon about £12bn for the sports pitches alone) but to be absolutely honest I can't fault your logic anywhere - diabetes is crazy expensive, and utterly debilitating to those who have it. I might spend a bit less on children and a bit more on young adults (because kids run around a lot, while twenty-somethings apparently spend all day eating, drinking and being sedentry the rest of the time), and try to get mental health treatment in a sensible place (although direct costs of mental health treatment are small, the number of work-days missed because of e.g. depression is a sizable chunk of GDP and therefore tax base).

I'd also shut down a lot of hospitals. I know that's apparently counter-intuative, but a lot of problems in the NHS are caused by politicians fighting to keep open specialist services where there is absolutely no need for them to be located. For example, there are three A&amp;E departments within five minutes of each other where I live (five minutes by blue-light ambulance, not five minutes by traffic-heavy commute.) In a high-skill emergency like a heart attack, the difference between getting a highly skilled surgeon / trauma team and an adequate surgeon / trauma team is much greater than the difference caused by a five minute delay in getting you to an acute ward. By coincidence, each A&amp;E department see almost exactly one-third of the cases they would need to keep their skills at really world-class levels, so combining them would mean a serious boost to the survival rate in these kind of acute emergencies. But because the A&amp;Es are located in constituencies run by different parties, and because locals love having a nearby A&amp;E, any plan to integrate the departments is blocked, leading directly to people dying when they need emergency treatment. It's a really sad state of affairs.

There's also mixed evidence on what happens if you deliberately run an unequal economy - the evidence is fairly clear it crashes very badly at a certain level of inequality, but it is possible that you get a boost to GDP by running Gini Coefficients in the sort of 0.25 to 0.35 range (so when society is a little bit unequal, but only about as unequal as the UK was ten years ago).",null,0,null,1429193177,null,0,false,0,cqebelo,null,t3_32sayh,null,t1_cqebelo,null,t1_cqeazjk,null,null,null,1432424738,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Sex education is a joke as it is, it's basically ""don't get pregnant"", I'd say it's equally shit for everybody and that's a sex education issue, not a LGBT in sex education issue.

Because when you have a man using a woman's bathroom, it upsets women, when you have a woman using a male bathroom, it makes men feel awkward. 

I didn't realise police ignored domestic violence if they where gay and I find that hard to believe, but if you have a source do show me. 

I don't see why homosexual would need more treatment than a straight person in an NHS hospital. Trans I agree with but that's simply mental health not having enough funding, not a LGBT specific issue. 

So yes, we are all on equal footing. There is nothing an LGBT person cannot get, I as a straight while male cannot get. That is equality, true equality. If they need to be more than equal with special needs then that is fair enough, but perhaps looking to UKIP for that is poor sense.

null,false,gamas,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,null,"&gt; Most people feel awkward when straight couples make out in public, the reason it's probably met with less hostility is because men are less violent against a woman than they would be with two males.

Straight couples don't get attacked just for holding hands in public... Also your presumption doesn't hold since lesbian couples get the same hostile treatment, if not worse treatment.

&gt; Suicide rate seems irrelevant to rights.

It indicates that there is a problem that society is failing to address

&gt;Because when you have a man using a woman's bathroom, it upsets women, when you have a woman using a male bathroom, it makes men feel awkward.

The problem is that trans people are discriminated against regardless of what gender bathroom they go in. A male-to-female transsexual will be attacked in a male bathroom for being too feminine, and attacked in a female bathroom for not being feminine enough.

&gt;I didn't realise police ignored domestic violence if they where gay and I find that hard to believe, but if you have a source do show me.

There is generally less support networks open for LGBT domestic violence issues. Also, I believe some laws don't adequately cover these cases (for example rape law doesn't cover female on female rape).

&gt; I don't see why homosexual would need more treatment than a straight person in an NHS hospital. Trans I agree with but that's simply mental health not having enough funding, not a LGBT specific issue.

See the part about higher suicide rates... Also some sexual health related issues are specific towards LGBT people and are not adequately covered in our current system.

&gt;There is nothing an LGBT person cannot get, I as a straight while male cannot get. That is equality, true equality.

And as a gay, white male, I can categorically state that this is absolute bullshit.

Yes, but it's irrelevant to rights, and that's what we're talking about. 

You can't stop people being uncomfortable with trans people in their bathrooms, again you said attacked, if they're assaulted for being in the wrong bathroom that is subject to the exact same punishment as if I was assaulted for wandering into the wrong bathroom. It's equal. 

Female on anybody rape is something fixing. It's not just lesbian rape, a female cannot rape *anybody* even if she drugged you, strapped you down and gave you boner enducing drugs and raped you for a week, it would be sexual assault. I know a man who has been raped by a woman and he was laughed at, that isn't a strictly LGBT issue, that's a female in sexual assault issue. 

Yes, which is why mental health in general needs additional funding. It's not just trans people suffering from poor mental health, depression, dementia, the elderly are all (depressingly) equal in their poor treatment 

The issue here isn't that LGBT has any less rights than others, they don't. In the eyes of the law LGBT and straight people are exactly the same, it's public perception. But if you want to tell women to not feel uncomfortable changing in front of what used to be a man, and still looks like a man, well you're going to have a difficult job.

Very rapidly though the T started to include not just Transsexual's but also other entities (Transvestites, pure fetishistic crossdressers, etc.)... who are by and large heterosexual and want very different things to a TS.  For example, for the majority of Transvestites a gender recognition certificate or the ability to be married to someone of the same sex is neither use nor ornament.  To use an old and probably quite out of date statistic:  1 in 10 men is a crossdressser of some description, 1 in 50,000 is a M2F TS. 

The Transsexual's quickly became a minority within the Trans community and the general backstabbing, politicking and arse about face behavior that endears us to no one that anyone who's been involved in the GLBT/LGBT community for the last few decades has witnessed began.

What on Earth do you think these people ""speaking"" and ""protesting"" about these issues are actually asking for? I'll tell you one of the main things: *legislation to protect consumers*.

Speech and protest as a response to injustice as it happens is just not that immediately helpful to the individuals it actually happens to.

But at the end of my A-Levels I was thinking hard about what I wanted to do, because I had to do something, at that point it was too late to sign on for that year anyway. The thought process was that I love making things, I loved DT at school, and I get a lot of satisfaction teaching people about things I know, so I thought 'hey, why not teach tech?' so I looked up what I needed and set to that.

But just thinking about spending 3 years at uni is not pleasant, and 4 years before I can get a job. The thing that's really bothering me too is the fact that if I decide to move on from teaching, well, what the hell would I be qualified to do? Because really none of the other opportunities that Product Design will offer me are ones I'm particularly interested in taking. 

I think I've actually talked myself out of this! Don't know how I'd tell people though, they were all so proud of me and happy when I told them that was my intention, and to go back on that would reflect badly on me, not that that should stop me however.

The real problem with selling alcohol is the setup cost and legal stuff, I've spent days trying to make my way through what I'd have to do, and I've got a rough idea, but it's vague and unclear, I'd probably have to get legal advice.

You want to make people stop being homophobic by choice, not by fear. 

It's similar to where a lot of anti Islam and racist sentiment comes from. People are no less racist than they used to be, they just fear showing it now. Ex ""you fucking cunt"" will get you disciplined. ""you fucking nword"" will end your career. This actually makes a worse situation for Muslims because it's silent resentment, stopping people talking to them at all, fearing rightly or wrongly they might ""say the wrong thing"" and be disproportionately punished. 

The last thing the LGBT community needs is MORE animosity because the law is stacked in their favour, causing resentment with the average, most likely not too intelligent person. 

So yes, my original point was there is nothing in the law that gives me as a straight male any more or less power than a homosexual. Yes, a homosexual may have a harder time socially, especially with older people, but as soon as you start punishing people further for that, it's only going to build resentment which nobody benefits from.

&gt;I was told I was high risk the first time I went to a clinic. I'd slept with one person. We were both virgins prior. We used protection. I was pretty much 0 risk.

Forgive me, but from the perspective of a sexual health officer you *are* high risk. They don't know you, or your partner. They can use as much of your sexual history as you'll admit (and believe me when I tell you people lie about that all the time) to colour their assessment of your individual *absolute* risk, but in population terms simply by being a sexually active gay male you are at 'high risk' (relative to the baseline) for a whole host of STDs. One of the favourite stories of my (spectacularly gay, Karaoke Drag Queen) GUM doctor friend is the number of people who simply cannot understand *how* they caught X, Y or Z because the few people they'd slept with **swore** they were either virgins or neurotic about protection.

Recognising this isn't discriminatory - this idea actually boggles my mind since forcing the government to **recognise** the disparity in STD rates and make appropriate provision in Sexual Health clinics to deal with the problem was a very long battle and something of a triumph for the civil rights activists of days gone by.

Just take a step back for a moment and consider that - irrespective of how it makes you feel - the fact that you sleep with men increases your likelihood of contracting or carrying various STDs, then ask yourself if it's better the government recognises that fact (and ALL its implications, ranging from appropriate provision for sexual health to restrictions on blood donation) or ignores reality and just lets things unfold as they will.",null,0,null,1429198798,null,0,false,0,cqeeo6y,null,t3_32rvoo,null,t1_cqeeo6y,null,t1_cqee6dn,null,null,null,1432426277,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

null,false,chimpyang,null,null,null,"A major problem of shutting down A&amp;E departments is the lack of infrastructure and overall plan for who will take the volume of patients.  It's not just the front door stuff - there's knock on effects for the rest of the hospital.  It's also going to be very expensive, unpopular and hard to explain.

For each DGH with an A&amp;E, they will have the labs, clinical teams and beds to support investigations and admissions.  If we presume that the A&amp;E patients that need admission (which usually end up as referrals to specialist teams i.e. Ortho, O&amp;G, Medicine etc...) end up at the designated ""Super A&amp;E"", you'd have to build in the capacity for that hospital to take over that demand and work that the extra patients will generate - which means building more bed capacity, more A&amp;E capacity, transferring staff from the hospitals that won't need to run an acute take for A&amp;E admissions, lab staff, support staff - cleaners, porters etc.. - all very expensive.

The interesting thing will be what happens to GP referrals.  Would they have to goto the new super centre - or will the remaining DGH's run acute takes for GP/Clinic referrals and an inpatient review service?  The former will need yet more capacity to sort out and the latter is less rational and probably more expensive.  If we did the former, lots of the acute teams at the DGH's with closed A&amp;Es would naturally get transferred to the centralised hospital, which will need to ensure that they have ward beds, operating space, clinic space to operate efficiently.  There would also have to be a robust cross county agreements for ambulance services and discharge planning.

Some services - e.g. trauma, work on a centralised model and I believe that payment does follow the patient.  But they tend to rely on there being less specialised Trauma/Orthopaedic teams that filter their take into the trauma team as needed.

I agree that some things need consolidating and rationalising, but it'd be a brave politician to try and explain that.  It'd also require a lot of investment before you start seeing benefits in the long run.  We'd have to specifically design the service and not end up hodge podging it, which I'd guess we would.",null,0,null,1429198984,null,0,false,0,cqeesdk,null,t3_32s2dz,null,t1_cqeesdk,null,t1_cqeb7le,null,null,null,1432426331,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

But to say no progress is being made, or that I'd like to see equality laws reversed is ridiculous. Victory is inevitable as more younger people enter politics. So I'd rather put a larger focus on other, equally important but less certain issues rather than pretend the former is a losing battle.

This being said, saying nothing on LGBT does *not* mean one is against that way of life. Our move toward equality is a given and is an evolving issue that is hard to quantify. We must be vigilant for everyone, every day, against a dynamic social setting. That is equality. There are other, more short term and static but still important issues that a government of five years must adress solutions to.

null,false,Usmanm11,null,null,null,"I've seen this a few times and the reasoning is actually a little more subtle than what is usually made out. The reason is historian's dislike putting a ""flavouring"" term onto *any* era of history, not necessarily whether it's true or not. Many scholars would have just as much objection to calling an era of innovation the ""Light"" ages, because they prefer utmost neutrality in all things. 

I don't see the problem of using it in common parlance though, since the reason the objection was made only really applies to people who study it for a living. Most people probably won't be aware of the nuances in the middle ages-- and the dark ages are a catch-all term which everyone knows. 

It seems to be quite strange that people almost seem offended when you refer to the era as the Dark Ages in Europe, but almost unquestionably and by virtually all metrics the early middle ages were the ""darker"" ages, compared to what was before and after them. That's not to say there weren't events and outcomes of colossal significance to everything that follow in this era, indeed it was as significant as any other point in history, before or after, but it seems to me bizarre to get so uppity about labelling an era of regression as such. For instance, the greek dark age is still labelled the greek dark age and I've never seen anyone criticize it. 

And besides all this, there is the sheer literal fact that they were the Dark Ages, because we have only the vaguest idea what happened for most of it, since the historical record is scant to nonexistent. And not just obscure things which only historians care about, but huge and important events such as wars of major consequence and kings who are responsible for the fate of modern nations can sometimes be scarcely placed within a century or two, or don't even get names apart from obscure mythos written sometimes centuries later. Compare this to the classical era where the literary record is so abundant, we can often pinpoint the exact motivation of rulers or how soldiers were feeling on a particular day.

The 'Dark Ages' isn't acceptable even in common parlance because it's flat-out wrong (I highly doubt a physicist would like it if people called gravity velocity or something like that, for instance) - it encourages the incredibly out-dated Whiggish and teleological attitude of history as the relentless march of progress, while also being incredibly Eurocentric (the Middle East and China were by no means stagnant) and looking over things like the Carolingian Renaissance in the ninth century. The Middle Ages were a period of history that saw the emergence of things like universities, urbanisation, parliaments and sophisticated financial systems, it certainly wasn't an 'era of regression'. 

Your last paragraph is also wholly inaccurate. There isn't an 'abundant' literary record for the classical era (especially ancient Greece), even when compared to the stereotypical 'Dark Ages' period. Just of the top of my head, you've got Bede, Fulda, St. Bertin, St. Vaast, Einhard, Notker, Ermoldus, Thegan and the Astronomer. 

It's also hard enough to pinpoint the motivations and feelings of figures from the 20th century even with modern sources, let alone those of, say, Augustus or Claudius using the likes of Tacitus, Cassius Dio and Suetonius (the latter of which is more tabloid journo than historian).

my order of best forming/most influential are: 
1. hazard 
2. de gea
3. sanchez
4. coutinho
5. kane
6. costa

that's just being fair. without hazard, chelsea would not be where they are, and costa wouldn't have scored as much (fab is also a huge reason he scored so many goals early on...notice as fab's production slowed, costa's did)

de gea, well he's been worth approximately 15 points for mufc this season....early on when they were not performing well but grinding out draws and 1 goal victories were all down to de gea putting them in that position. in our game, had raheem or balo put one of their early chances away and de gea didn't make god like saves, we would have probably beaten them in my opinion. de gea and some close but not quite perfect finishing changed the course of that game and many more. 

sanchez has been brilliant all season. he has a great team around him, but was performing when arsenal weren't quite up to snuff and has now elevated again to another level. he works hard for his team and is extremely influential on their results. 

coutinho for me had a bad aug - november and has since turned it up a gear. if the awards were given from jan - end of season, he would be the prem's best player. he has been very influential and hard to stop. some might point to his games against united and arsenal and that is one reason i don't think he will get voted, but i also think the level of the team dropped for those games and it was hard for him to have an impact when his teammates couln't impact the game at all themselves. 

kane for me has been awesome, great, the best striker possibly in europe since his streak started. the boy is literally like king midas and cannot stop scoring. my only problem with him is that he really requires good service and is up with the team and down with the team. i haven't really seen him make a lot of out of nothing enough for him to warrent being the best, or even above the others. 

and finally, costa...i think he has been brilliant this season as chelsea's main striker and i so wish we had signed him last year. people keep talking about a torres/suarez partnership and what that would hve been like...well i wish we had a costa/suarez partnership last year. we would have absolutely won the league. a sturridge, costa, and suarez front three would have been the most prolific front three ever. 4-3-2-1 xmas tree with the front three interchanging...wow that would have been great. but alas, he's on chelsea now and a complete ass. i am glad for many reasons he's not with us and upset he isn't for many reasons. but he is doing his job..finishing for chelsea and helping to earn them some serious points. his form early on is going to be the difference between chelsea winning the league vs arsenal storming back and winning the league. i think arsenal will be 1 point off the lead by seasons end and you can attribute that to costa's cold blooded finishes early on. my only reasons for him not being higher on my personal list is that i feel he is very reliant on the play around him. fab's form dropped and in turn so did costa's in many ways. i think hazardd has been the best player on that team by a country mile and in the league. 

with that said, some honorable mentions that i think **could** have been mentioned: 

- tadic, what a magician he is
- fonte, he has been great all season as well 
- eriksen, he is the real catalyst for that squad
- blind, i know it's unpopular on this sub, but credits due where credits due. 
- ki seung from swansea, the guy should definitely be a target for us. he has shown me a lot this season. 
- charlie austin, the guy has been on a tear on a shitty team. he will move for good money this summer to a top 8, maybe top 4 side (if he's willing to fight for a spot and see some bench)...
- final guy on my list, kevin nolan...i just love the guy. i think he has been class for west ham for years and many of his colleagues say as much. 

anyways those are my two cents, and i am super excited for young philippe. he is only going to get better, cn't believe he's just 22. ",null,0,null,1429203623,null,0,false,0,cqehql0,null,t3_32tjhe,null,t1_cqehql0,null,t3_32tjhe,null,null,null,1432427722,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

What does history and context have to do with whether she actually hates men or not?

I know, your point is that even if it were true she actually hates men, it would still be different from someone who hates blacks, because that latter someone would represent and add to a broader historical pattern.

Which may or may not determine whether something is hate speech in the eye of the law - I don't know enough about the specifications of hate speech law to know.

But goonerh's (and others') point is that even if it's just her, and only says something about her person (rather than implying any kind of broader social or historical issue), that still very much makes her the wrong person to be on a LibDem political committee or the like, even less so on one about equality.

(Personally I doubt she really hates men, she probably really is just trying very hard to be edgy.

My school was about 30% Muslim and I had some good friends there who were Muslims. They were considerably more intelligent than you are.

&gt;Do you think a Catholic and Protestant can get along? Despite their recent history? Or do you think it is impossible?

I don't know what this has to do with anything I said.

In the future, of course we can hope for peace. But it is a fact that sectarian hatred between Irish Catholics and protestants remains a huge problem, just as it is between Shias and Sunnis who originate from certain regions.

Even though violence in Christianity is now limited to Africa, nobody would ever claim that Christianity doesn't have the potential to be a violent religion.

If there were a huge number of immigrants from areas of Ireland afflicted by the troubles self-segregated into Catholic and Protestant areas anyone sensible would *absolutely* anticipate problems.

I would never say that peace between Shia and Sunni Muslims is impossible in the future, but the current situation and the history are violent. Where there are large numbers of immigrants from regions of conflict they tend to bring their prejudices with them.

But it is very hard to argue with you, because you just ignore every point I make and instead invent some bullshit of your own to argue against that has nothing to do with me.

Well, not likely violence in practice... Probably not even jail time... But sure, if you're eager to defend your violation of the law with violence, sometimes this will be met with violence.

&gt; that is backed up by the enforcement of making them take it down.

Sure, that is very roughly speaking how law works, yes.

Do you not consider it moral to ""*make*"" people respect other's rights in other situations either? Do you not consider legal consequences for stealing moral? How about drink driving? Rape and murder? Because your argument would apply equally well (or, rather, poorly) to those things, too.

null,false,JamesFromUK,null,null,null,"&gt; Since 1999 the banks had been growing and growing and generating a huge economic boon.

Private banks are the problem. They create money via debt which inflates the money supply over the short term but devalues the value of the currency over the long term. Private banks grew because the former Labour government relaxed mortgage lending criteria allowing the banks to flood the economy with cheap credit. The boom was unsustainable and has since required ever greater state intervention in the housing market to prop up property prices.

The previous Tory administrations sold off huge amounts of government assets, allowing them to take on enormous debts which again benefited the banks.

&gt;Labour, rather than putting this money away for a rainy day, spaffed it all on massively expanding government programs

The national economy does not run like an household economy. 

&gt;It actually became a joke round where I grew up that if you were out of work you just ""went on the sick"" 

Which started in the 1980s under Margaret Thatcher's government.

&gt;Suddenly when the banks stop paying so much tax and lending so much money, the government finds itself in massive, massive spending deficit. 

Then the solution is to allow the government to create money debt free, rather than relying on private banks.

When we attack in a 4231 our fullbacks go forward, the centre backs spread out and a DM slots just in front and in between the widened CBs (in the 3421 this would be Fazio). (also, the reason we leak so many goals is because we dont have this dedicated DM playing currently, like Sandro or Capoue who slot in there, we have Mason and Bentaleb).

In the 3421 one of the midfield pair would be a bit higher up the pitch feeding the front 3, so when that player moves up to play with the front 3 and the other midfielder stays back, the shape is really starting to look like a 4231 in attack, where the more advanced 3421 CM would be in the same position (or just a bit deeper) as the middle man in the front 3 of the 4231. 

Basically the only difference for us, is that it would be like having an ultra defensive 4231 with Fazio as one of the DMs and one of our CMs as one of the front 3 from a 4231 in attack. It would give our fullbacks more room to get forward. But in my opinion, to play 3421 you have to have wing backs that are really worthy of the extra room you are providing for them in this formation.

I think there's an obvious difference between ""kill all men"" and ""gas the kikes"" no matter whether the person saying it is serious or not. For the reasons you mention.

I am still interested in how it works in actual hate speech law though. Whether they make a distinction between ""kill all men"", ""kill all women"", and ""kill all blacks"" (I assume so); and whether that distinction extends to the point that targeting a privileged group rather than a group with a history of oppression automatically frees you from any liability (maybe not?). 

Not that a few tweets like these are court material, of course, so that's more of a hypothetical question. 

I guess it does go back to some kind of underlying question though - is anything OK (not talking in a legal sense anymore, but in a social sense) as long as it's targeted at a privileged group, no matter how hateful? Don't think anyone would get upset at ""Eat the rich"", but I guess things get a little more tangible when saying ""kill"" instead of the obviously surreal ""eat"" - and then things become a bit of a mess the further you go down the road, because society isn't neatly divided between the privileged and the oppressed. Most people are some kind of mix of privileged and underprivileged identities (class/gender/sexuality/race etc). Which is why some of this discourse seems to inevitably end up having to arbitrate the different kinds of oppression in order to be able to determine what should or should not be allowed to be said by who to whom etc. 

Anyway, all that is still a tangent. The two more basic questions, I guess, spring from this:

&gt;If someone were to hate men then yeah, it would make them inappropriate for a political office, however I don't believe that is the case here

A. At some point, when someone keeps making over-the-top jokes targeted at one group, you've gotta wonder whether it's really all just a ha-ha-I'm-just-mocking-them thing. Or whether someone's really got a personal issue with that group going on. 

I think the jury's out on that one - you argue that all the tweets (and I think there's a link to a speech somewhere there too, though I didn't bother to read it) are clearly just examples of mocking misogynists in a specific context. I'm not so sure. For whatever it's worth (which is not much, considering everyone here's anonymous), there seem to be a couple of people in this thread who know or have encountered this person, saying that she really does have issues. Which is still fine -- who cares, we all have issues -- but then probably better not to sit on a political party's committee about equality.

B. Here's something I do have an opinion about: assuming it was all jokes and sarcasm, that still makes her ""inappropriate for a political office"". 

You don't even have to make apples/oranges comparisons about 'what if a man said that about women,' even as a joke, or what if a white guy said that about blacks, etc. It doesn't fly when you're speaking from a disadvantaged position either -- like one other commenter [pointed out](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/32sil5/liberal_democrat_executive_committee_member/cqe9ldt), ""I'm sure a black rights activist saying ""Lets enslave all the whites"" would get shot down in a heartbeat too.""

Mostly it's just about not being a dick. Just browsing those tweets, not just the words ""kill all men"" but the whole stuff, this is someone so painfully immature, she doesn't belong in politics, student or otherwise. She sounds like a total arse - kinda like [what this commenter said](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/32sil5/liberal_democrat_executive_committee_member/cqe9bd6). I'm sure she won't hurt herself on all that edge as long as she's going for ha-ha backslaps of agreement on Tumblr or Twitter or in a student club, but yeah, not ready for any political function or public office.

Primary School, 1980s.

Tarmac yards for both Infant and Junior stages of the school.
Large grass field for use in the spring and summer, and for things like sports day. Infants had their own smaller field which was fenced off from the Juniors one. Indoor PE was done in the main hall. Outdoor PE was mostly athletics and rounders in the summer.

Secondary School, 1990s.

Large tarmac yards and an indoor 'quad' style area in the middle of the school. Large grass playing fields with an athletics track marked out, football / rugby pitch, and long jump areas. Outdoor 'all weather' pitch which was fenced off and had a hard, dusty surface, no astroturf or anything like that. There were also some tarmac netball / tennis courts, again fenced off from the other playing fields.

Indoor facilities were a gym and a separate, larger sports hall, both with their own changing facilities. There were two indoor squash courts and also a weights room. The sports hall was shared with the council for community use and was open to the public at weekends and after school.

Boys Games lessons were generally football and rugby, while girls got netball and hockey. PE was a separate mixed-gender lesson, generally gymnastics in the gym in autumn and winter and outdoor tennis / athletics in the spring and summer. Any lessons rained off usually saw both genders moved to the sports hall for light athletics / fitness / gymnastics.",null,0,null,1429208823,null,0,false,0,cqel5hx,null,t3_32rrcm,null,t1_cqel5hx,null,t3_32rrcm,null,null,null,1432429402,null,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1,null

It's paid back in a proportion of your income, in a progressive manner, once you start earning above a threshold. After thirty years, you are no longer under any obligation to pay it. Normal debt doesn't work like that - mortgages and bank  loans don't have such favourable terms.

The point of the new system is to introduce a ""de facto graduate tax"", which works, effectively, as graduates paying slightly more income tax than people who didn't go to university.

Those who earn little after graduating won't pay much back at all, whereas those who earn a lot will pay back more. It is not debt. It is a tax, for all intents and purposes. What could be fairer than that?

It's just that the language of debt already existed under the previous system. I agree, it's unfortunate.

That tuition fees trebled with Lib Dems in government is a mere technicality.

It's normal to not understand something like that. Most people would never consider their gender at all. 

You're stereotyping, though. The results of hormone therapy and surgery depend on the original material (how they looked to begin with) and the quality of the surgeon and a fair amount of luck. The stereotypical view of a transgender person is a woman who's clearly a man in a dress, with bolt-on looking fake boobs and too much makeup. It's bullshit. Chances are you've seen more than one transgender person and had no idea - that's the point. 

And you're very wrong to compare it to children. It's not ""gimme gimme. I'm going to threaten to kill myself unless you give me the shiny surgery."" What the hormones and surgery do is bring your body closer in line with what your brain thinks it is, thinks it should see in the mirror.

Cutting translation is just going to mean that non-native speakers are left *more* confused by official paperwork and technical jargon, and *less* able to integrate themselves.

Where was the announcement of increasing spending on *helping* people learn? That would be constructive encouragement, rather than another classic-conservative ""Hit them with a spending-cut stick until they magically fix their own situation""... because, evidently, what's holding new arrivals back from learning the language is that they don't want to and can't be bothered because we'll just translate everything anyway.

It wasn't until years later that I picked the series up again. By the time Smith came around I'd realized that I was looking forward to the next Doctor. That I appreciate them all for what they bring to the role. They've all done a great job of staying true to the core traits of the Doctor; Enthusiasm, Curiosity, and embracing the Unexpected.

This can be solid, if mass scaled, can be similar to how other countries buy only bottled drinks, then give in their bottles back to the shop for a discount on a new pack of drinks, to then be washed out and re-used at the drinks factory. But this would also mean for each takeaway to have extra cleaning on top of everything else, since you can't trust people cleaning at home (i never would, could shut down the shop from food poisoning with one mistake!).

The tiffins themselves, are they currently in mass production? Would increasing production harm the environment more? And also what about other alternatives that could pave way in the future, such as biodegradable containers?

I doubt (m)any people are going to, for example, vote Labour as a result of this debate instead of Tory.

I think the real damage from this might be to heap on the pain for the liberal democrats... their voter share according to polls has plummeted since 2010 and Clegg, as technically incumbent, has been excluded from this debate. So far he has completely failed to revive the ""cleggmania"" of the debates in 2010, and this is now a missed opportunity to defend his party against the challengers that have emerged on the left... since UKIP don't seem to be seriously challenging the conservatives at this stage (although the potential role of UKIP in denying the Tories of seats they would otherwise have won remains to be seen).",null,0,null,1429211585,null,0,1429211793,0,cqemz2r,null,t3_32ss30,null,t1_cqemz2r,null,t3_32ss30,null,null,null,1432430261,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

null,false,Kesuke,null,null,null,"In all seriousness I think it was a calculated risk on the Tories part. Remember before these debates their only other experience of televised debates was in 2010 when the ensuing ""Cleggmania"" caused a last minute lib dem swing which at one stage even looked like it could land Cleggs party in power (and ultimately sort of did). The other two leaders (Brown and Cameron) failed to connect with voters in this format. Cameron will know that he's not a particularly dynamic politician infront of the TV cameras in the sense that say Boris Johnson is. His only saving grace is that his adversary Ed Miliband is about as [photogenic as ermagherd](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/275/927/c4b.jpg).

So I think the Tories took the risk that they would appear in the debates but water down the format and limit the damage incase they came across poorly. Now in retrospect they actually haven't performed too badly and I suspect that they might secretly be regretting not just signing up to it - but at the end of the day 2 months ago they didn't know that.

As much as people are criticizing Cameron for this, it's worth remembering that his parties watering-down of the format so he comes across better and the inclusion of the SNP/Plaid (at Labours expense in Scotland and Wales) has actually been a pretty big victory for him. He could have been up on screen against just Miliband... which would have been pretty tough given that the tories have built their campaign on *""don't vote for miliband because he's an awkward fuck""* which would quickly fall apart if Miliband comes across better than people expect - which he probably has (if only slightly).
