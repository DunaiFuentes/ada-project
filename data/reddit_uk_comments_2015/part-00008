null,false,purplepooppants,null,null,null,"As it stands, it's not a very good tax.  It creates a distortion whereby parents are incentivised to pass on wealth well before their death, for no reason other than to escape the tax.  We can fix that by generalising it: instead of an inheritance tax, have a general ""gift tax"" that applies to any asset transfer down the generations, irrespective of death.  This would have a threshold too.

Then the question is what the threshold should be.  The purpose of the inheritance tax is to prevent dynastic wealth growing to such an extent that it creates damaging social effects, or challenges the power of the democratic state.  Given that, the current threshold is much, much too low.  Wealth like £650000 is just a nice 5 bed house in the home counties, it does not have a social impact.  Taxing those levels of wealth has no benefit other than enriching the treasury, which is not the point of the tax.

We might assign the wealth based on a percentile of the population: set it based on how much the top 0.5% or so is passing on.  That would set it at many millions, which would probably be a more appropriate sum, though imho anything under approximately 10 million is still too low.

Another alternative is to consider the source of the funds.  If someone has made that money during their own lifetime, then they might be allowed to pass more of it on untaxed, whereas someone who has inherited wealth might be prevented from passing much at all on to the next generation.

null,false,raceAround126,null,null,null,"Yes, it can happen. 

Please don't write a letter with a cheque attached! You need to approach it as:
""My friend/relative is willing to pay these debts for me.""

Then you give your friend the money and they pay it from their account. But be aware, this is not an overnight thing to do. You need to write to them with the offer first and wait for their response. 

Now there are a few tricks to be aware of.

- When you send the letter, it's a common tactic by the DCA to cancel your monthly direct debit as they take the letter as an inability to pay. This way, they can make it look like you have defaulted on the agreement. So keep a keen eye on your bank account and make sure the payment goes out. If it does not go out, make sure you pay it manually!
- The letter may say ""full and final settlement"" but if you send them a cheque, they will cash it and say it's partial settlement. DCAs are not your friends, they're around to make money. By having a 3rd party involved, you protect yourself by law as the contract is with the third party. There is no way for the DCA to pursue or sell on the debt after that point
- Check out the all about debt forums for template letters. And read experiences about settlements.

Don't worry too much, it is possible to do this and it is beneficial. As they are no longer on your credit record, I assume that all these debts are over six years old so any defaults are long since gone too! I would suggest however that your offer of 30% may be a little low. Closer to 50% is more likely. But there is no harm in offering.

So be careful, there is a way to do this right. Just be patient and do it right.

Offer first, wait for response. If accepted, get a 3rd party to pay from their account either over the phone via card or via cheque. 

Also, contact the debt advice service. They can help make sure your offer letters are sound and that, if accepted, the final letters you receive which confirm the debt is closed are all proper and correct!

I took the opportunity to spend a few years in the States when it was the right time in my career to do that. It was awesome. As nice as Formby is, maybe a few years in Hollywood would be a wonderful experience for the Gerrard family. After one of the wettest years on record, why not head to California while you still can.

Liverpool are at the stage where they have squandered last season's momentum and are now regrouping for a future that doesn't include Gerrard. I'm sure we'll be hearing about the dreaded ""three-year plan"" soon enough.

Stevie's greatest contributions to the club have already been made. As fans, we see a nostalgic romance in the idea of him being a one-club player; we don't want him to leave. Real Madrid's fans didn't want Raul to leave either, but who today wouldn't agree that it was the right decision for him at the time?

As sad as it is at the moment, surely Gerrard taking on a new challenge is the best thing for him right now. He's said he doesn't want to linger at Liverpool having his playing time gradually reduced, but I think everyone here already realises he can't play every match for Liverpool. His vision and passing ability will allow him to become a superstar in a league with less frantic running around than the Premiership. Let him go somewhere where he can achieve further glory while playing to his strengths, rather than being stuck in English weather trying to be either a defensive midfielder or the kind of hyper-energetic attacking midfielder that Rodgers needs.

Most of all, there is no need to try to dig around apportioning blame, when what is probably the right decision has been made.

He would need to get decent people on side, not angry football fans. He needs to speak out against those harrassing the accuser and disassociate himself from them. Keep his head down, not try and weasel his way back into football despite the opposition to him. Like it or not, he remains a convicted rapist with an unfinished sentence.

No it's reality.  If you look at corp tax receipts have dropped dramatically at time of record profits and stock prices (I know its not directly related but relevant).

Google for more sources


&gt;  The fact is I don't think corporations should pay tax on profits

And here is why I wonder why I've spent so much time on this thread...   Please show me a study/proof that this will work.   Where would the missing money come from or will you raise personal taxes?  Assume current spending levels too. 

(Note, dividends should be taxed higher IMO on top of current system as it is, not take away further taxes in lieu)

You are of course arguing the trickle down effect economy.  I would point out that with corp taxes being so low the last few years there has not been any trickle down, just more money being stored.

null,false,alexrobinson,cnty-england,Manchester,null,"I'm not the guy you were replying to, but the issue isn't people not wanting to vote or being unable to. The issue is, we have a two party system where every voter is essentially given two options that are worth voting for and voting for anyone else is essentially a waste of your vote. What this creates is a situation where people vote for the big party they dislike the least, this means they are not in any way expressing their actual most desired party at all. The voting system we use is systematically flawed, every first past the post system is inevitability going to result in a two horse race.

The solution to this is to adopt another voting system, one that allows voters to vote for their most preferred party, but also show support for other parties, should their preferred party not win. A couple of examples of this are the Alternative Vote system and Single Transferable Vote.

These alternative voting systems solve many of the issues that arise with our current system. No longer are people forced to vote for a party they may dislike, simply to avoid having a party they dislike even more coming into power. It also ensures that the party that wins the election is supported by the majority of the population. For example, say there are 3 parties in contention in an election. The first secures 32% of the votes, the second secures 32% and the third secures 36%. The third party wins, yet only 36% of the population actually wanted them to win, where as 64% did not.

&gt;- When you send the letter, it's a common tactic by the DCA to cancel your monthly direct debit as they take the letter as an inability to pay. 

Everything is paid through standing orders; I refuse to give 99% of companies my bank details as I don't trust them. 


&gt;- The letter may say ""full and final settlement"" but if you send them a cheque, they will cash it and say it's partial settlement. DCAs are not your friends, they're around to make money. By having a 3rd party involved, you protect yourself by law as the contract is with the third party. There is no way for the DCA to pursue or sell on the debt after that point

Does this mean I need to actually get, say, my dad to actually write to them making the offer? Can I negotiate the amount, then get him involved if we come to an agreeable figure?


&gt;Don't worry too much, it is possible to do this and it is beneficial. As they are no longer on your credit record, I assume that all these debts are over six years old so any defaults are long since gone too! I would suggest however that your offer of 30% may be a little low. Closer to 50% is more likely. But there is no harm in offering.

Yes, none of these accounts show on my file anymore, so it makes little difference to me if I pay them now or keep doing monthly payments for another couple of years.  Are they likely to feel similarly? 50% is the maximum I see as being worth me bothering.

Within the EU perhaps it would be reasonable to nominate your country of domicile and you are allowed to vote there. I suppose it would get complicated to switch this though.

That's never been in contention. The point is, the land belongs to them at the start of each new reign and they would be within their right to hold on it. i.e. until it is seceded to parliament in exchange for the grant, **it is their private property**. 

I'm left with the impression you still don't really understand. 

&gt; It's not her private property, she would not keep it if she became a regular private citizen. Nor would she want to. 

I can't comment as to her personal wishes (apparently you can?) - but as to the first part, if she became a private citizen I would argue one of two things must happen; either the land reverts to being her private property OR she must continue to receive the sovereign grant in perpetuity, per the terms of the agreement. 

In all likelihood, in the incredibly unlikely and unfathomable event of the formation of a republic, I suspect what would actually follow would be a series of complex negotiations which would hammer out these sorts of issues. It's likely for example the former-monarch would contemplate ""releasing"" portions of the Crown Estate in exchange for concessions on tricky issues like inheritance tax. The other possibility would be that the Crown Estate effectively becomes a sort of public-private body on which the former-monarch has a large or even majority shareholding.

null,false,TheAnimus,null,null,null,"&gt; yes, then scientists realized that the particulates are really bad for us so this is changing. Petrol is the less of evils after studies. Not sure why hard to understand.

Then why did places like CA (as I mentioned before) never promote diesel?  Some places had this view long before.  The issue was that people (as I mentioned before) were transfixed on CO2.  Externalities are fun.

&gt; I would assume stopping all coal/oil subsidies for one and the other is new roads (from what I understand of Green Policy)

That's nothing.  We already give TFL billions per year.  We don't have many subsidies for these energy sources that are anything more than exploration or to provide stability of supply for us as a state.  In fact when it comes to the money we raise from taxes on fuel, we are not in any way, providing a net subsidy.

Just think, to really improve the tube capacity say, how much money that would be, look at the costs Crossrail is facing for the N/S link.  Tickets will still be very expensive.  Scrapping road improvements for places like Cornwall, which desperately need better transport infrastructure is definitely not the answer.

&gt; If you look at corp tax receipts have dropped dramatically at time of record profits and stock prices (I know its not directly related but relevant).

Record profits?  Not sure which places you are seeing those.  Rises in equity values, one could argue can be inversely correlated to CT returns, due to growth stock mentality. The link you provide talks about why this is the case too, it's not just companies structuring themselves abroad.

&gt;Please show me a study/proof that this will work.

I'm not arguing about any kind of trickle down thing here.  I'm talking about taxing all income, regardless of source, the same.  Why don't you like that idea?  I don't get the notion that a return from an investment should be taxed less than the return from time spent scrubbing toilets.

To me, this is a moral issue,  Unless the proof thing is my comment about closing the gap happily, when I said close the gap happily, I mean people wouldn't be able to complain about it because effectively some might say that div tax + Corp Tax = high enough personal tax rate.

&gt;You are of course arguing the trickle down effect economy. I would point out that with corp taxes being so low the last few years there has not been any trickle down, just more money being stored. Your ideas would just continue the transfer of wealth to the top 10% and 1%

Except that hasn't happened, even the FT article you linked to mentions that the lower CT might well have helped the growth.

As for wealth re-distribution, that is a people thing.  Companies don't matter if they hold assets, it's the owners of the company that matter, as the company is just a legal concept to make things simpler.  You say my ideas would continue that wealth transfer, that is obviously bullshit, because I'm talking about people paying more tax, not less, as is, the current system means they are exempt from NI.",null,0,null,1420642315,null,0,false,0,cnh9rvw,null,t3_2rjg8f,null,t1_cnh9rvw,null,t1_cnh9aj4,null,null,null,1425011241,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

See, there are areas in which the land and property belong to what's called a ""homeowners association"" which (editorializing here) are generally a bunch of dicks who get a tiny amount of power (in this case, the ability to dictate and enforce the rules of the homeowners association to anyone who lives in that area) and go on a power trip handing out citations, warnings and violations to anyone who does not conform to the rules.  

These homeowners association rules are not HUGELY restrictive, provided that anything on your property fits in with the rest of the neighbourhood and doesn't stand out as different, unique, special, creative or indeed interesting.  

Now, playing devils advocate to my own opinion, a homeowners association is ostensibly to protect residents from people who don't bother with maintenance and upkeep on their property, making it an eyesore in the neighbourhood.  It's also there to protect against those who like to erect disturbing, gross, tacky or offensive items in their yards or on the outside of their houses.  Of course, it's their judgement which says what is offensive or tacky...

Why bother with a homeowners association?  You don't really get a choice in the matter if you purchase a house in an association's area.  See, in these areas when you buy a house you own everything inside it - every inch of the house that is inside the roof and siding.  The exterior of the house, and the property itself, belongs to the association and you agree to the rules when you buy your house.  

Why is a homeowners association good?  Familiarity, uniformity, cleanliness, less risk of property value dropping due to undesirable properties nearby.  (A lot of them also organize snow removal and maintenance if the exterior of the home is damaged)

Why is a homeowners association bad?  Conformity, oppression of true creativity, lack of individuality, the association board could be unreasonably draconian about the rules, any change you wish to make (putting up a patio?  A privacy fence?  flood lights?) must be given permission for first.

null,false,Kesuke,null,null,null,"&gt; You're very correct to point out that royalists probably wouldn't even want this property to fall into the private ownership of the former monarch even if they do have a sketchy legal claim, as the state would tax them

Well that's a double edged sword - I don't think either the state or the monarch would want it. The state wouldn't want it because the former-monarch would be within their right to sell the property to whomever they want (it is after all a free market). That means the government would have to bid against any willing participant if they wanted the land. In effect land the government ""effectively"" administers and financially benefits from by way of the Sovereign Grant would fall into the private sector, unless they stumped up the money to buy it outright - which could run into the billions.

As I stated in another post, the most likely serious outcome, if we all decided we wanted to be a republic (which is itself amazingly unlikely) then there would probably be some sort of complex negotiation process during which the monarch exchanges things that legally are likely to go in their favour (like the Crown Estate) against things that are legally unlikely to go in their favor (like inheritance tax). The outcome would be a family that are still immensely wealthy and a country that is still administered by the same people... so I don't really see what the benefit of it would be. 

But at any rate, I don't agree with your contention that the Crown Estate isn't the property of the monarch simply because the scale of the lands seems to be unreasonably large and their method of acquisition was not necessarily morally upstanding in the modern sense. There clearly exists a complex legal relationship between the Crown Estates, the monarch and government and in reality ownership of the land is *de facto* the monarchs, if in principle the proceeds are controlled by the government and the administration of the land is via a board. I simply don't agree that in ending the monarchy you could end their ownership of the estates. The Crown Estate has special legal status and there is no legal basis under which it might be seized from them.

But as someone who also has good life skills, supportive networks and a loving family and someone coming into contact with people who are addicts like myself this is not always the rule and addiction ( especially alcohol ) does not discriminate. There are also other factors to be considered like genetic makeup ( personally I come from what I've now discovered to be a long line of alcoholics in my family history ) 

Also in my support groups ( around West London ) I've met Judges, teachers, professionals, scientists, all sorts of different people from all walks of life who became addicted mainly because they just liked the drugs and/or alcohol to the point that it turned into a major problem for them. For a lot of them - like myself -  the social/family/work problems were caused by the addiction itself, they didn't exist prior to it. 

So all things in moderation really or - like myself and many others - you could become an addict. Don't think that you can't just because of your social standing.

The visa you will need is a J-1.

http://j1visa.state.gov/participants/how-to-apply/

You pretty much have to go through an authorised 'sponsor' to get one.

If you already have a job offer, you can typically get the employer to fill out a form and send to a sponsor to get the process going. Various schemes and sponsors work different ways though.

I think STA travel up near by Queens and USIT (used to be in the Students union, think they moved down to city centre?) can get things like this sorted, but are expensive. Might be worth talking to them regardless.

I'd perhaps spend an afternoon clicking through the list on the state.gov website (you can filter by 'summer work'). See if any of them make sense. They'll probably all charge though.

But yep, it's bloody expensive, time consuming, and annoying. I've gotten easier entry into soviet bloc countries....

I agree it would be an opportunity for him, but in all seriousness, I don't think he will go for it. Prepare to say ""I told you so"" if he does, but I'm just going by the guys personality when he was our youth coach.

He's a complete perfectionist, I don't think he'd relish the opportunity of dropping to the Championship with barely any spare cash to bring in players.

Not to mention Rangers fans want good players *now* not 3 or 4 years in the future when youths develop. If they wanted to make their own players, they had the perfect chance in D3, but decided to sign Jon ""Knackered-knees"" Daly with a wage of reportedly quadruple what he told Rangers he would accept.

Reap what you sow, fans expected big players, they got them, however they overestimated their financial firepower.

If Cathro got the job as soon as Rangers went bust and restarted, he'd have a full team of Rangers youths, with a couple of experienced heads in there (McCulloch, Wallace and maybe 1 or 2 more), rather than signing internationals and the likes of Kevin ""Injured"" Kyle.

&gt;The midfielder confirmed that the prospect of having his game time cut, outlined to him by Rodgers in November, was a key factor in his decision not to renew.

It's like you guys don't want to deal with reality. Gerrard didn't want a limited role... that's why he didn't sign a contract, not because he didn't get one right away.

&gt;Yes, letting Reina, Agger, Carra go has been good for the club. Who needs actual leaders at the club.

What the fuck are you talking about? Reina pushed for a move, then didn't want to play second fiddle to Mignolet. Agger, likewise, didn't want to sit. Carragher CHOSE to retire.

I just don't understand where you get this idea that the club is somehow forcing these players out. They aren't. They are being realistic about the roles the players can have at the club, and the players don't like that idea so they leave.

While in age terms freshman year is our year 10, in academic terms (ie; the difficulty of the work) it's closer to year 8 or 9. For example, SAT level mathematics is equivalent to GCSE maths in most areas. 

Going from sophomore year to A levels would be very very difficult. Even most UK kids struggle (initially) with the difference in difficulty. The gap will be even larger for the most part. Obviously there may be things you have already done and thus are easy, but I'd be surprised if you'd done more than 10% of any course, and the other 90% would be significantly harder for you.

There's also no real way to equate your grades, as afaik the U.S. System is very fragmented and I highly doubt that many UK schools will have an in depth knowledge of how your particular school district operates. You haven't got/won't have any formal qualifications, the most they'll have to go on is your GPA, which I've been told can vary from school to school and even class to class depending on whether a particular teacher likes you (to an extent at least). So that will make it hard for the school you want to come to here, to figure out whether they believe you're good enough. 

Your best bet would be to contact the schools you're looking at and to ask them. If they're fee paying then they may be more inclined to let you in, assuming you can afford the fees. State schools would probably be more reluctant. 

But as others have drawn upon, this isn't the only issue. What visa would you come in on? Can you even afford that visa? Where would you live? Can your parents afford boarding costs? Are you coming to be closer to your boyfriend (absolutely ridiculous idea btw)? 

Personally I'd stay where you are, in the education system you've been brought up with, know and understand. Get to senior year and if you still want to come to the UK for university then apply then. (I can almost guarantee you won't be with your boyfriend anymore, so it will be a true test of whether you want to come to the UK for the UK, or for him). 

I think you're completely underestimating the difficulty in logistics, the difference in the education system. the massive financial costs it will incur and how scary moving to a completely new country is.

A couple of points for you to consider:

- You will make money over renting. Even if you bought and sold at the same price you would still have paid off some of the mortgage meaning you would get more back, as opposed to renting where you get nothing. Even if the mortgage is more than you were paying in rent doesn't mean that you are somehow losing money over renting where your loss is always 100%.

- They just changed the way stamp duty works, you're going to be paying a lot less for properties in your price range if any at all which works in your favour but may create more competition (people who have been thinking about it jumping in).

- You will need an additional couple of grand free for extra costs. Solicitor is going to be 1k then you have the conveyancer (around 500) plus moving costs. The mortgage won't cover this, it's on top of what you need for a deposit.

- Buying is not the massive deal people say it is and nor are you magically locked in never to escape. If you want to move you can, most mortgages are 'portable' meaning you can just shift it on to a new property without paying the early repayment fees. I'm selling mine after doing it up and swallowing the early repayment fees.

- It's all about you and your partners combined income, that's what the banks will look at (assuming you are buying the property together) which is why a couple both on 50K can afford a house for 400k.

- the longer you leave it the harder it is to get on the ladder in London as property price increases consistently track above the national average and average earnings. So better off sooner rather than later - however there is a general election coming up, these are known to create instability in the housing market and slow things down. I was talking to an estate agent about this very thing last Saturday, that's how I know. The election may be the time for a bargain, there will always be the people who need to sell asap and so will accept much lower offers when the market has slowed down.

- Final point is,     take   your    time     . It's easy to see a house you like, estate agents probes you for a price, before you know it you have an offer in and the wheels are in motion. You need to do your research properly on a property, checking out the schools, neighborhood, crime map for the area, even go to the street late at night and sit in your car for a while to check it out.

&gt; Anyone who votes Labour because of the Lib Dems on tuition fees

Lib Dems have since changed their tuition fees policy, it's less about being betrayed by a broken promise and more about it being a different policy.

Also Lib Dems had a clean slate before 2010, so they were trusted. People knew that both Labour &amp; Tories do whatever they want when they get power, regardless of their manifesto. 

The issue that people have with the Lib Dem tuition fee pledge is that it got them a lot of votes, many students who wouldn't have voted, went out and voted specifically because of that pledge. They threw away their trust with those people, so now they are viewed in a similar way to the other two, and therefore are judged entirely on their policies.

Fall 2014: Gerrard features in the XI of nearly every match we play and looks terrible in most of them, clearly lacking the physical ability (speed, stamina etc.) necessary for our level.

November 2014: Rodgers sits Gerrard down and tells him that he will only be used as a squad player for the most part and will have a more limited role.

Some time after that meeting: A new contract is offered to Gerrard. He decides not to sign it because he wants to play every game and accepts an offer from LA Galaxy where that is possible.

I'm not interested, all I know is that back in the early 00s, there been a *diesel is bad for your health* movement, that was over ridden with the *CO2 is bad mmmk* movement.

&gt; if you took all of Oil/Gas Subsidy and put into TFL it would pay for most of all the fares. 

Not even close, from your own figures.  Now I understand how the green party does it's maths.  We'd still have an almost £2bn gap.

Even with that funding it's still cheaper for me to drive than take the tube.

I'm in favour of more mass transit systems for London btw, as I mentioned before I think the cycle scheme could be extended with power assist, we could make some areas cycle only etc.  All low cost suggestions.  Sadly, however I think even doing that, weather would limit uptake.

&gt;so?! We are still subsidizing a private business that is causing C02... we should stop.

The state paid for me to have text books, these textbooks were printed by a private firm, that produced CO2.  Let's not be loony about this.

Because it's not really a person's income, it's a conceptual one.  As for cash reserves, again this is a very complex issue, some would argue it's a solution to QE and the like putting too much cash into a system.  Or mind-changed reaction to the greenspan puts from last decade.

Taxing those doesn't really make sense, any more than taxing any money in a bank account would, rather than taxing the monies received as a result (ie interest) when it's transferred to a person.

My current 'company' is in fact 4 legal companies, registered in 3 countries, with the parent owning all of them.  Trying to tax operation reserves in each one is silly, as it serves no purpose, it's net same as taxing at the end, but makes life simpler.  This needlessly complex structure is a reaction to UK/EU/US/HK/SGP/AUZ laws.  As is, it's trivial to declare all income as profit in HK, meaning I'll pay much less tax.

Islam is neither left nor right. It's a totalitarian all-encompassing ideology, not dissimilar to fascism. You can't put it on the European left/right spectrum.

You are saying that our elected government must think extremely carefully before going to war against a foreign entity or country, because the inhabitants of that country/religion might launch terrorist attacks in the UK? They need to now weigh up whether people with extranational allegiences   might turn against their host nation. Doesn't that bolster peoples arguments who are against immigration, given that war has been a part of human history since time immemorial?

Here's the (undated) official line from the [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/faqs/digital_radio_Radio4LW_5LX) 
&gt; DAB Radio 4 LW - The Daily Service and Yesterday In Parliament
&gt; 
&gt; Flexibility within the DAB system means that part-time 'secondary services' are created to allow broadcasters to transmit extra programmes.

&gt; Radio 4's LW output is transmitted as a side channel to Radio 4's main output. 
&gt; Yesterday In Parliament and The Daily Service are broadcast on DAB in this way.

&gt; To access 'secondary services' you need to tune in when the service is actually broadcasting. That way your radio will store the station in its memory. Check your radio user guide for details on tuning to secondary services.

There are no figures for the number of people killed by vehicles where the actions of a cyclist were the contributory factor.

Edit: Apparently some people disagree with me. The main reasons I'd equate it to league 1 football are: 

1. The movement is too slow. The fullbacks are always 3 metres behind on the overlap, and the strikers movement is honestly quite poor, they don't run the channels well, and their diagonal runs (often more than half a second ahead or behind where you'd want them to be) are miles behind what you'd see out of a decent striker - which the championship would have. 

2. Positioning of the players - the midfielders don't find gaps nearly well enough, its a lot of athletic work for waste, the pressing is often poor because theres 1/2 people in a system that aren't in the right position at the right time, and they don't do triangles nearly well enough amongst the midfield. 

3. Movement of the Football - One of the way you can tell apart good footballers is their ability to read the game three steps ahead. They play it like a chess match. Footballers in the MLS often like to play a pass which really should've had two passes in between, or needed a decoy run to create the space, or really they should've just recycled and and pushed wider. Its very direct football - which is good, makes it entertaining, but similar to how it'd be in League 1. When I'd watch Defoe, he'd just look so frustrated. You could tell that he wasn't on the same wavelength with his strike partner and midfield, and he a couple seconds ahead, or thinking three passes in the future when everyone else wasn't.

Technique wise, they're pretty decent, no doubt. But so are League 1 players. Pretty much anyone playing League football is going to be pretty good technically because they've all come out of football academies growing up, and they know whats going on. Athletically, the MLS is better. The draft picks, young americans, they're great athletes, better than their english equivalents I'd say. But in the Championship you start to see true football, good passing movement, smart football. Its rare to see that in the MLS, although some of the top teams do it better than others.

I like him coming in a lot for 2 reasons: 1, he's an immense talent who, if he can get his head sorted (which we're quite good at), can be a world class player.  We need players who are on the brink of a breakthrough like him, not the ones who are still years away from it. And then 2, because so many of our players are very, very young and should be protected a bit.  If Shaqiri is in the squad then we can give Sterling that couple of weeks or rest without skipping a beat, we can nurture Markovic a bit more and really help him grow into himself at his new club, we can protect ourselves from the hit that comes with Lallana getting injured, and not have to run them all into the ground competing on 4 fronts.",null,0,null,1420646748,null,0,false,0,cnhc110,null,t3_2rm9tj,null,t1_cnhc110,null,t1_cnhbgah,null,null,null,1425010190,null,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3,null

No, you've got it a little backwards. My premise is not that all individuals have no faculty or desire towards altruistic behaviour - my premise is that *not all* individuals have a faculty or desire towards altruistic behaviour. It's not enough that *some* should be altruistic if the system relies on altruistic behaviour - in such a system the percentage who behave altruistically needs to tend towards one hundred.

This is the reason that systems such as communism, or anarchism, or any non-statist state will fail now and probably forever. Any system which relies upon altruism is a fatally flawed system because not everyone will behave altruistically. A system which relies upon self-interest can work, because humans can be relied upon to follow their own self-interest in nearly every case.

This is the paradox about statism. To enable a collection of humans to morally coexist we require a state, which requires taxation, which is immoral in itself. However without said state we're faced with the inevitability of a greater level of immoral activity by people acting for their own self-interest in a way unconstrained by rules.",null,0,null,1420646826,null,0,false,0,cnhc2k3,null,t3_2rme17,null,t1_cnhc2k3,null,t1_cnhbuq0,null,null,null,1425010170,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

No I'm claiming it's irksome when a government encourages something at the expensive of something else.  In this case, CO2, at the expensive of health.  Granted that is net environmentally friendly, because the shorter we live, the less we pollute!

I'm not claiming ignorance either, or being wilful of it.  I'm just saying I hate been told what to do, and that advice being wrong, which is frequently the case when you tell people what to do.  This is why I don't like big government.

I have no interest in why CA got it 'right', because frankly, as Talib wrote, if you run the choice enough times, some will get it right by randomness alone.

&gt; however these were not the same years and there is more subsidies going in this year so I'm more right than wrong...

You are also looking at subsidies for the UK as a whole, and applying them to just a small chunk of people.  You also are not considering why those subsidies are important in the first place.

&gt; I'm not, statements like that are though

No because everything produces environmental concerns.  Everything.  This is why the environmentalist in me favours population controls, no more than two children but higher quality of life for those children, with less harm done to our earth.  I'm almost becoming a humanist.

&gt; we can agree to disagree on your opinions of taxation.

Sure, all I can say is i've been a 50p rate payer, I now run a couple of companies, and that Amazon makes no real profit, so has nothing to tax.  Tax people.  At least we agree income should be taxed the same.

Is there a reason it has to be for a month? You could quite easily spend a week or two in Europe for less than what you've already saved, and flights to the continent can be had for very little. This has the benefit of not adding to your debt, and reducing the time you need to take off work unpaid.

The final three listed fall under acts the BBFC views as potentially ""life-endangering"". [source](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/a-long-list-of-sex-acts-just-got-banned-in-uk-porn-9897174.html)

Also ""extreme pornogrpahy"" is banned under 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_63_of_the_Criminal_Justice_and_Immigration_Act_2008


An act threatening a person's life

An act which results (or is likely to result) in serious injury to a person's anus, breasts or genitals

An act which involves (or appears to involve) sexual interference with a human corpse

A person performing (or appearing to perform) an act of intercourse (or oral sex) with an animal (whether dead or alive)

Rape porn may also be banned in  britain ( I think - can't find the specific law ) 

http://www.businessinsider.com/people-with-rape-porn-in-the-uk-could-get-jail-time-2013-11?IR=T

even though

&gt;But the Ministry of Justice recently said there is ""no evidence"" that such material harms society, it has emerged.[source](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22803502)

There are a number of angles one can take

1) The list of extreme pornography does involve violence as entertainment, animals and corpses who can't consent.

2) Bans on pornography makes it harder for the general public, which might include teenagers, from getting access but the determined can still find it. It's kind of like having two laws. the official law and the unofficial law. Banned porn is less likely to show up on xhamster/porntube sites.

3) The list of porn banned from being made in the uk could easily fall under health and safety at work legislation. Almost all acts banned could result in physical harm and as such would be banned in any other workplace.

4) Just because a causality mechanism isn't proven doesn't mean there isn't one

5) To legalise is to normalise. 

6) It encourages harmful attitudes towards women. It is said by feminists that porn involving causes misogyny, rape and sexual assault.  Although there has been a massive increase in pornography consumption since the internet became mainstream there has not being a corresponding increase in rape or sexual assualt. However measuring misogyny is difficult to say the least. 

7) If you get turned on by some of the things in the ""extreme pornography"" bracket you may need a psychiatrist more than you need pornography. 

8) Whilst some say pornographic fanatasies help deal with desires that would be harmful if acted out in the real world ( ie rape ) others say that pornographic fantasies help fuel harmful sexual acts.  Sometimes sick people who sexually harm individuals are found with extreme pornography in their home leading some to say that shows a link whilst others say ""look at all the people who had it and didn't commit crimes""



However you could also say

1) Until there is a proven link between pornography and crime there is no need to ban anything consenting adults do. In fact it may be counter productive and lead to people seeking to satisfy their fetish in real live with less safety. /u/devilishrouge has a good link about porn and effect on society [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2rm6yl/in_light_of_the_recent_uk_porn_bans_bbc_magazine/cnh5m2v)

2) Porn is sexual fantasy.  Whilst people may have fantasies that are violent that does not lead to people being violent. It's acknowledged that many victims of crime have revenge fantasies that are often violent [source](http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/cj-jp/victim/res-rech/hill.pdf). However there is little evidence that they act out on this. My assertions is that almost all people can tell the difference between fantasy and reality and almost all people have an inbuilt mechanism that makes them not want to hurt other people ( studies of soldiers post ww1 showed that most soldiers who actually saw the enemy didn't actually shoot at their enemies, about 1 in 10 did  - The army has to give soldiers special training to make sure they can actually kill another human being and don't freeze on the battle field).

Japan

With regard to japanese drawn pornography my understanding is that it is so widespread in japan that proving a link between it and child abuse would be difficult.  I find a lot of japanese culture very odd in ways I don't see in south america or africa or the middle east or places in east asia like south korea.

We are subsidizing a private industry, an industry that is bad for the environment no less.  The argument is energy independence of course, but that's just a boondoggle.  The reality is we should be looking for energy independence in renewables and put subsidies there.

I'll echo what you said though, if you buy a property that isn't freehold, whether it's a house or flat, you don't own it and you have to pay someone else to live there. Granted the lease might be for 100 years but that still means that at the end of that term your investment will be worth effectively nothing so if you expect to hand your house down to your kids you might not be leaving them much.

The big problem with buying a flat leasehold is that it might only be a tenner a month management charge now but someone might buy the building and start charging £100/m and demand £10,000 per property to fix the heating system. The latter could happen at any time. You would be better off renting.

Townsend's lack of any creativity when dribbling (just hits it past them and runs, it's so obvious what he's going to do. No fakes, no shift of weight it's predictable as shit).

Lennon's lack of confidence at dribbling past players. This is the only thing holding the guy back really, as you don't need great shooting as a traditional winger. Most of the time Lennon hasn't got the confidence to take his full back on so he shifts it back to Walker or to another midfielder. This has gotten even worse in the last year or two.

Wisdom and Ibe on loan have shown immense promise and are gaining a ton of experience. Ilori has been hampered with injuries.

As for transfers, Moreno is solid, Sakho, when he plays is pretty solid. Can has had a number of good performances, and even Markovic has been playing better lately. Allen has been average with some good and some bad performances. Lallana is a ""for now"" purchase, and he has shown what he can do, now that he is settling in. 

Lovren, Ballotelli are the 2 bad purchases as they haven't been producing.

Manquillo has been average as well. 

Transfer markets are hit or miss, buy some proven talent for a lot of money, or buy young talent and hope they hit it big.

I was surprised it didn't blast out the usual *""HERP DER DERP, IN HOLLAND PEOPLE CYCLES PLACES DERRRRR""* routine... the point being that holland (for complex and numerous reasons) is the exception and NOT the rule. 

Anyway, after nearly 1 and a half decades of local governments trying to encourage cycle it still only makes up around 2% of all UK journeys and I really don't see that significantly changing. A lot of major incentives (not least the relentless roll-out of cycle lanes the nation over) and a major campaign over the Olympics still haven't really driven uptake. 

Personally my view is that Cycling is a bit like wind-power... it looks good on paper and in principle it *ought* to be the panacea for all our problems. Unfortunately it just doesn't translate that simply in real life. We'd be better off looking at better solutions to our energy and health needs (like pushing hybrid/electric/ultra-efficient cars, carbon capture and a sensible electricity generation plan based on a strong foundation of nuclear).

Unfortunately it appears otherwise as fear of being labelled as such is motive for crying rape when a rape did not occur.

&gt; If he was innocent, to get his name cleared, he would need to go through the correct legal channels. Not a tacky website unearthing tweets from months after the event to shame the accuser.

There speaks a person who is not a lawyer. Any prosecutor worth their salt would pounce on that as demonstrating lack of conviction about their innocence. 

&gt; He would need to do the right thing and humbly speak out against rape while maintaining he is not a rapist.

Which would result in him being ridiculed and called a hypocrite.

&gt; He would need to get decent people on side, not angry football fans.

Which decent people would want to risk tarnishing their own reputation by championing a convicted rapist?

&gt; He needs to speak out against those harrassing the accuser and disassociate himself from them.

This has some merit, although I doubt it would do him any good.

&gt; Keep his head down, not try and weasel his way back into football despite the opposition to him.

""Weasel""? He is a footballer. Like most footballers he doesn't really have any other career skills. He is good at it and it is better to have him employed and contributing to society than unemployed and a net drain.

A good example is the cycle path outside my village that leads to the main road and stops.....We don't need cycle paths in the village, we need them on the busy road! 

Who uses a cyclepath that just leads to a road no one would ever consider cycling on? Its all back to front.

- Response one is the proper, well thought out response which of course makes the most fiscal sense:

In short, no, keep saving wait another year until you have the money and holiday allowance and go then.

- Response two is this:

Don't go for a bank loan. I'm assuming you have no other significant depts at this point as well. Instead put it on a credit card with a years 0% interest and work out the payments you would need to make to pay it off in a year. Get these set up and stick to them.

Make sure it's an amount you can comfortably repay. After 4 years in work (and I'm assuming you feel it's a secure job) you're unlikely to suddenly not have one and 0 prospects of finding another. The one point I would make is wait until you have some holiday, you might be able to stomach a weeks unpaid by eating noodles for the next month, so 15 days holiday would make it much more affordable without the need for additional debt.

I have travelled and so have many of my friends. Some of have got them into debt doing it. No one I know regrets it or has had any significant long term financial problems as a result. Yes it isn't the most sensible thing to do, but in reality if you don't take a bit of a risk on these things it's unlikely you will experience them whilst you are young and working as there are always bills to pay. It only gets worse as you get older (mortgage, kids,etc!).

Go, but make it worthwhile. I spent almost a year living off a few grand when I was travelling, I'm sure £800 would do for a month if you're backpacking and go somewhere cheap and exotic :) . You just need money for flights, say another £500 - £800 giving you a manageable amount to pay off.

I think what was done with Peterson, as an example, is a much better thing to do.  He's getting regular game time at Utrecht, has a goal and a couple of assists, and I think that's far better for his career than playing in our U-21s or going out on short term loans to a random side where he is unlikely to feature much.  We need to be a bit quicker in either bringing them into the first team properly with regular, albeit infrequent, minutes or let them go.

Oh I agree, my point was that Townsend tries shots that he hasn't got the ability to pull off.

&gt;Townsend has four assists only in the current season. He only had 1 in the league last season, but he also only played 5 games.

I looked it up on a [stats website.](http://www.whoscored.com/Players/71522/History/Andros-Townsend)  Correct them if they're wrong, they don't include cups and I don't think include penalty fouls as assists.

I don't remember a time where he scored or assisted against decent opposition.

Apparently not, it was the cops deciding they could get a conviction out of it to help their figures and look good in a heavily politicised area that brought the initial charge. 

&gt; I admit he is in a difficult position, but the way the website is presented currently could actually get him in more trouble than it showing some kind of conviction of his innocence.

It was the trial notes that convinced me of his innocence but most people won't read those and a website provides the synopsis in a more easily digestible format. It serves a purpose for those looking to find out what actually happened.

&gt; It is a tacky smear campaign against the victim, not a protestation of innocence.

How does it attempt to smear his accuser? It points out the undisputed facts and shows the video but doesn't encourage negativity towards her, only that people judge for themselves based on the evidence.

&gt; If no one of decent standing is willing to align themselves with him, then that says a lot to start with.

It says a lot about how politicised rape is, it says nothing about whether he is innocent or guilty of it.

&gt; At the moment it comes across like he thinks what he did was acceptable and that rape is acceptable.

What he has admitted to doing *is* acceptable - having sex with a consenting adult. What he is convicted of doing isn't. Unfortunately the law enables the latter from the former. 

&gt; There is nothing stopping him working as a bin man or in a tuna canning factory, people's issue is him going straight back into football after committing rape. 

He hasn't gone straight back into football after committing rape, he's spent two and a half years in prison. People would have issues with him taking any job, but football does seem to get up some peoples goat particularly, even though that's what he is trained in professionally.

They are the majority, I think. Moral transgressions are everywhere, committed regularly by many if not most. People think that not murdering or raping or robbing banks makes them good, but then will happily help themselves to the iphone left on the bus seat, or take any opportunity to easily defraud any large corporation on the basis that it's just a ""big faceless multinational"".

Of course, this is very much into my own anecdotal world here, but I've met very few people with serious, actualised moral systems. This is why, in spite of my own worship of personal freedom, I believe that modern western democracy is probably the *minimum* mass control device which can be applied to societies if we wish to prevent widespread individual immorality. Painful as it is to admit, the optimum solution does appear to be that people should have certain choices restricted in order to prevent them making the wrong choice.

The moral solution is very different to that, but is not in any way practically ideal.

American Football typically gets the best athletes the country can produce. Strength, size, and speed; they almost always gravitate to American Football.

Every year, the best amateur collegiate American Football players prepare for a ""Draft"" of talent into the NFL, and one of the tests every American Football player goes through is the 40 yard dash.

The ***best*** athletes to play American football at positions where speed is required are often in the 4.4s to 4.5s. Occasionally you'll see a few players a year in the 4.3 range. 4.2 is nearly unheard of. The [fastest recorded NFL player 40 yard dash was 4.24s in 2008](http://www.statisticbrain.com/fastest-40-yard-dash-times-in-nfl-history/). There's only been [5 players in the last 9 years](http://www.nfl.com/combine/top-performers#year=2006-2007-2008-2009-2010-2011-2012-2013-2014&amp;workout=FORTY_YARD_DASH&amp;position=QB-RB-WR-TE-S-DL-LB-CB-OL-SPEC) to go under 4.3s.

So, again on the assumption that Yedlin ran that time, he's probably going to be *roughly as fast (if not faster) as anyone in the PL*.

Or would you rather compare him to Dejan Lovren, whose wages are around £70,000/week? 

The largest difference between these players and Gerrard is their position within the team. Hypothetically, Lovren will be at Liverpool for some time. He is an investment, and (for all of our sakes) will look to be improved upon for a foreseeable time ahead. Rickie Lambert was extra padding to a front line and is comfortable sitting on the bench and substituting in, while providing leadership and experience for a very low price.


Let's use a shitty analogy! What would you rather pay for, a Honda Civic that might last you 5+ years (with available upgrade or resale an option), or an Audi R8 that you're paying more than the MSRP for which has been guaranteed to break down once you've driven it for one year or so?

As for cleaning the EGR valve, it's one of those things that may work or may not. In the long run, it most likely won't work. Hence if he charged you and it screwed up again, you'd be back complaining about a non-needed or unreliable repair. Diesels are grey areas for mechanics and, as such, he probably decided he was better off not charging you rather than getting it on the book. In fairness, I would too!

I'm assuming you had rough running, high fuel consumption or similar problems with general running. Even though the EGR is gunked up, it could be a symptom of a bigger problem. Most notably a turbo about to pack up. Turbo failures on modern diesels are incredibly common and usually mean a big repair when they do break up. I've read a lot of stories of car dealers opting to ""buy-back"" used cars after turbo failure rather than agree to repair it under SOGA. 

Put it another way, if this guy replaced the EGR and then the turbo fails, suddenly he's potentially liable. By saying, ""I'll keep it off the books, clean it up a little and hope for the best"", he's doing you a favour without opening himself up to recrimination. 

He is acting fairly but in his own best interests. Google around for what I've mentioned, include your car model and get educated on it. To save you some time, if your EGR is genuinely sticking then it's likely you're not driving the car enough. Modern diesels are built to pummel through about 20k a year. If you're doing anything under 10k a year, you're going to get issues.

Consider yourself warned.

Very friendly bunch of people who teach set meditation courses from the Tibetan school of Buddhism. I haven't been for a year (but may well start again soon) and although I'm strictly secular, I found them useful (as long as you can tolerate a small amount of ritual with a wry smile). These courses are very easy going, break for tea and chat etc. I think they're £6/class or something. 

Triratna: http://www.edinburghbuddhistcentre.org.uk

Different school entirely, this is a very western side of meditation/Buddhism. These courses are somewhat more intense and concentrated, but I found them very useful to dip my toes into meditation practices. My memory is that you pay in advance for short courses. 

I'm very strictly non-religious, and although both groups represent some form of Buddhist belief, neither was ever pushy about it and entirely open to secular people. 

Never done yoga, sorry!

Come to think of it I should probably go back to one of the two again this year.

Some European sunscreens are considered ""the best"" because they state the SPF (protection against UVB) and PPD (protection against UVA) or you can work out the assumed PPD from the Boots Star System.

Asians round it up into categories but it's anyone's guess as to the exact PPD once it's PA++++ (Japan)/PA+++ (rest of Asia).

So to guarantee the best protection against UVA (the aging bit of light) people go for European sunscreens, specifically La Roche-Posay and Bioderma.

If you want to be super mole-like and erring way over on the side of caution, also avoid CFLs which are those energy saving light bulbs and opt for LEDs instead.

The amount of people who have been arrested for 'upsetting the wrong person/people' is much, much, MUCH, smaller than the press would have you believe. The event is so rare as to be an anomaly, and even in those cases it can often be chalked up to individual error on the part of a specific police force/magistrate, rather than a systemic nationwide problem.

Please understand: If you post on Twitter that you think David Cameron is an idiot. Or that all gays will go to hell and be damned forever. Or even that black people are somehow a sub-race of people, nothing will happen to you whatsoever.

If's when you cushion those comments within threats of violence, or alongside harassment and public order offenses, that you get in trouble. But mark my words, when you've been arrested, the Daily Mail will jump on the story that you were apprehended for 'speaking your mind', or 'having controversial opinions'. But no matter how much you believe it, that simply won't be the case.

If I were arrested for inflammatory, but perfectly legal, remarks on Twitter, I'd fight it all the way to the highest court in the land, and win.

Young people don't vote because they feel disillusioned with politics in general, it's unbelievably hard to know which party genuinely represents your views, and who is telling the truth. 


For instance, can you tell me what happened with the Tory analysis of the Labour spending plan? 

The tories are claiming they produced a ""thorough, objective and detailed"" dossier, while Labour claim it's complete bollocks. Some of the facts seem to have been disputed, and there seems to have been an attempt by the Tory's to make the dossier look like the Treasury Budget Red Book. Both parties are saying completely different things, one of them is lying.

What's very clear, is that the public are deliberately being mislead by politicians, and the media, and this is now the norm. 

So how exactly are we supposed to stay informed? 

These sort of things popup every few days, without spending hours researching every day, it's very difficult to actually stay informed these days.

Books, sure.

* The Tiger that Isn't - If I had my way, this book would be required reading for voting...  To many people have basic maths misconceptions, because our schooling is so poor.  This book has helped me explain and work with people who have conceptual gaps in their understanding of fundamental statistics, the authors did a great job of communicating concepts.
* Freakonomics - The sequel, superfreakonomics is really fun too.  It's an entertaining introduction to how economic theory can be used to explain things.
* The Undercover Economist - More of a free market is better than top-down planned economies, basically why socialism might be nice but will fail due to the complexity that is the real world.
* The Black Swan - Talib's book, it's so important for discussion, but I'll be honest, I hate it, I don't like books that could be properly summarised in 8 pages dragged out in book form, his follow up Fooled by Randomness has this trait too.

Well, certainly tricks. Had Evans had a lawyer from the outset he would have been told to keep his mouth shut instead of being honest that he had done nothing wrong. It was this honest depiction of events that enabled the conviction.

&gt; I see it as it just being based on the evidence

The evidence is that she doesn't dispute that she gave consent. The evidence is that witnesses for both sides say she wasn't too drunk to consent. The evidence is that the judge did not instruct the jury that being drunk is no impediment to ability to consent. The evidence is that it has all the hallmarks of a stitch up.

&gt; The website uses deleted tweets from months after the case

That directly refer to the case

&gt; it shows videos of her drunk

Or rather not appearing drunk at all.

&gt; it is a smear campaign against her character over anything else and is potentially in contempt of court. 

None of the material that was deemed admissible would put the website in contempt of court. The only thing that could is if she could be identified but as her face has been pixleated out, just as they do on crimewatch and so forth, she cannot be identified.

&gt; Is it not far more likely that he had sex with someone who was too drunk to consent, hence is by definition a rapist?

Neither the testimonies nor the video evidence support that conclusion, no, which is why so many people are up in arms about the conviction. He claims she gave consent, she doesn't argue that fact. The other witnesses say that she was in a fit state to consent, she doesn't argue the fact. Her argument is that she was too drunk to remember if she was fit to consent, but again the evidence about how much she drank, how much she was capable of drinking, which drugs she had taken and her condition and ability to consent at the time the incident occurred all contradict that she was unable to consent. 

If she wasn't able to consent and Evans took advantage of that I'd be on the other side of this debate. The evidence suggests that she was able to consent (and did) and at the very least there is more than sufficient reasonable doubt that the judge should have instructed the jury not to convict. As already discussed, however, [rape is a heavily politicised crime](http://bunker8.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/misc/brighton1.htm) and pressure about this, as well as perhaps about his relative celebrity status, meant that the wrong instructions were given and the wrong verdict reached.

Basically, your statement about ""a small portion having caused huge damage"".   Those people were definitely fueled by greed.

The problem is, their damage should have been contained, it wasn't.  Part of this was due to the US real estate market, mostly correlated risk.

I live in AniTown it has 100 houses.  What are the odds I'll default on my mortgage?  Let's say 1 in 100.  So AniBank prices that in, but it actually sells mortgages to all 100 houses.  You could say that means 1 will surely default.  Easy right?

The problem is, everyone in AniTown works at AniCorp, which sadly went bankrupt.  The odds of this happening could still have been 1 in 100, but suddenly all 100 mortgages are defaulting.

This is the correlated risk.  The problem is, my little example there is simple, the real world, the correlation is massively complex.  Imagine instead 10 mortgage providers.  Each of those selling their debt, effectively this is a natural obfuscation.  This is ironically an example of how planned economics fail.

So now individual institutes protect themselves, CVA is a common way of doing this, they look at the counterparty they are trading with, and try to model their total liabilities against them, to ensure that they aren't over exposed to say Bear Sterns going bust, by having all their different departments having trades with them.

I dunno if you are familiar with the millennium problems, but P=NP is a nice way of saying, it's easier to multiply 10 by 10, than to figure out all the factors of 100.

&gt;So how exactly are we supposed to stay informed? 

By drying your eyes, putting your trousers on and taking a little bit of responsibility for your own enlightenment. You could start by reading the executive summaries of important white papers, you could read a few books by authors of different walks of life (I've just finished The Establishment, and started Russell Brand's Revolution, even though I hate the two of them). You could read some of the classics (Das Kapital, Communist Manifesto, Wealth of Nations, even Mein Kampf). Read reports by the big Think Tanks, learn how they lean politically and adjust the salt you take accordingly. Most books can be knocked out in less than a week with an hour or so in the evening. It's not a lot to ask, and you have a lifetime to think about it.

This kind of stuff should be done as a matter of course anyway, just like exercise. It keeps your brain sharp and your wits about you.

Both cities have a massive Irish influence, in fact they are probably the two most Irish influenced cities in the world outside of Ireland. They are also quite unique in that you can sail on a cruise ship straight into the heart of the city rather than to the outskirts, not many places where that's possible.

Then series 6 happened. Then series 7. By Time of the Doctor, I found everything about the show so uninspired and ridiculous and insipid that I almost gave it up. I didn't pay attention and missed series 8 entirely. After some persuasion by a friend, I finally watched the entire series in December. It took me two days.

For me, Capaldi saved Doctor Who. I had become so *tired* of the weird geek-chic quirkiness that soaked through so much of Smith's run. I was tired of (and frankly embarrassed by) the bowties and fezzes and stetsons and the twirling and the pointlessly frenetic pacing. I was tired of the poorly-developed timey wimey plots, of Weeping Angels, of River Song. I was tired of how goddamn *indulgent* everything had become.

Capaldi was such a drastic departure from Smith, and he brought with him a complete shift in the tone of the show that I happily embraced. All of that self-satisfied self-indulgent nonsense had been cut away. And no, the writing this past series wasn't great, but I think it was a hell of a lot better than what we got in series 6 and series 7. I think it was a step in the right direction... or at least, a step in a direction which I prefer, though obviously we all have our own opinions.

All that said, I'm currently in the middle of a rewatch of Nu Who. I'm hoping that upon a second, marathoned viewing Smith's run seems less like rubbish to me.

I've heard it all now.

Pregnancy is a consequence, a result off, a subsequent eventuality too a conscious decision and that decision is the decision to have sex, get jiggy, have nookie, do the big mambo, the wild thing etc etc

Abortion is the unfortunate consequence to a bad decision. Contrary to popular belief there is no such thing as free love, sex always has consequences, it's great fun, I love it BUT you gotta be a big boy (or girl) and man up to the consequences of your actions, not take it out on the next generation.

Before you cry rape let's be serious, of the  +200,000 abortions in the uk last year probably less than 0.25% were down to rape, the percentage is so inconsequential it's barely worth mentioning as a reason in a pro abortion argument.

We are a sick society, we deny our nature, we run from the consequences of our actions and come up with terms like ""forced birth"". We cull our offspring to feed our appetite for consequence(less) sexual liberty. Never in history has a society controlled it's own population and called it freedom in quite the same way.

Before you then quote fatal foetal abnormality or danger to mum Etc I have no problem with intervention in those circumstances, who couldn't be moved by those.

But the reality is that's not what this is about, no matter what it's sold as. The overall long term goal is to make our system the same as the mainland UK and THAT would be a disaster for NI. I have no doubt whatsoever that LESS Children will reach the royals maternity wards if this goes through. 

And as a citizen of this country I am just as entitled to express my well thought out view as anyone else, I'm happy to explain it and defend it and at this point in my life I'm not to fussed if it's not popular or doesn't improve my karma on reddit

To be fair, it's 2015.

If you rely on the TV and rags to inform you on political issues, well . . . well there's not much hope.  The internet isn't a novelty.  

I'm likely to vote Green (not that it matters, I'm in a safe Labour area).  But the entire world needs energy, lots of it.  It won't need less, it will only need more, even if everything we use is efficient.  Access to energy equals progress.  Imagine what we could do with 10x the energy we generate today, but cleanly.  The thing we could achieve!

Nuclear is a very good stop gap.  Something that along with heavy investment into renewable / alternative energy is the most pragmatic choice today to ensure the earth is a good place for humans.

But /u/forgottenoldusername has a very valid point.  If you're voting for a party, you should at least know the basics.

Maybe we need a new party, The Technocrats or something like that?",null,0,null,1420660667,null,0,1420661126,0,cnhko1a,null,t3_2rme17,null,t1_cnhko1a,null,t1_cnhdg9x,null,null,null,1425006064,null,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7,null

Anyway.... Again I'm really surprised you continue to defend abortion on thd basis of rape, incest, fatal foetal abnormality or threat to the mothers life........ They account for less than 3% of the total.

Would you argue in favour of the monster raving looney party running the country because they had the same percentage of the vote?

Again, I have no issue with these medical intervention in these circumstances but there's a massive 97+% elephant in the room.

There is no doubt that if our countries system is aligned with the mainlands our people will by popular culture change to regard abortion in the same way and rates will increase exponentially. It's ridiculous to suggest otherwise.

There's a few ways.

Any player outside of Britain that we talk about has *probably* been linked with us in the press, even if it's a bullshit nothing story. From there we look at the players discussed as best we can and end up having an opinion one way or another.

Then we have fans who have a 'specialist subject', like, for example, a random Danish Swans fan who goes on forums and says this or that player is good and should be signed.

You've got a final category of fan who plays FIFA and Football Manager, sees a player who is good in the game, then looks at him in real life to see if he's as good and talks about him from there.

We absolutely do not rely on Gerrard to win us matches and I'm starting to think his brace against the wombles is something of a curse. 

We haven't relied on him to win us games in a long time. It was Suarez and sturridge last season and now after winning us ONE game with a brace we suddenly rely on Stevie again? 

Liverpool fans, although we love him like a brother, have been reiterating for the past 12 months that stevie needs to play less, and shouldn't be in the team on merit alone (not saying he has been but there have been times where it's looked like he wouldn't have been on our strongest xi). He's been anonymous in dozens of games over the past 2 years and yes, while his passing range is outstanding, he has not been outstanding for us consistently in any way. 

The most frightening our midfield was last season was against spurs (0-5 away), without him, our midfield was quality against swansea too last week. We were gifted with a goal or two but our intensity and press forced those errors. 

Gerrard will be a huge dressing room and leadership loss but on the pitch over the past 3 years, he is absolutely replaceable. Not in his day he wasn't replaceable, but he's a very different player now and anyone who has followed Liverpool since he broke through will know the player now and the player at peak are worlds and worlds apart. Totally incomparable. 

We have Sturridges, Sterlings, Sakhos and Coutinhos in our squad. Plenty of world class and potential world class. Gerrard has scored a handful (at best) number of goals over the past 2 years from open play, we categorically do not rely on him to win us games.  

What a load of bollox that is. I'd nearly prefer he didn't get that brace the other night for the shitstorm the media is creating over him being out best player.

ISAs aren't earning much right now and if you have spare £4K which you're not spending (which you aren't else you would have spent it already), you can use £1000 of it to transfer between accounts to satisfy almost all requirements for guaranteed high(er) interest, relative to an ISA.  Couple that with incentives that First Direct and Halfifax give you for switching to them (use any current account, you don't need it to be your spare one) and you're laughing.  5% interest with Nationwide, £60/yr with Halifax, plus 3% with Santander, and I think 4% with Lloyds.

You want to talk about fundamental flaws in strategy? If unionism hadn't been so despicable as to spend 50 years discriminating against Catholics (treating them as untermenschen, in your words), the communal divide would have disappeared by now. Mistake number one.

As for uniting Ireland by agreement, that's another one you can thank unionists for. Ireland is divided on the basis of the arbitrary and artificial 'unionist majority', you made yourselves the roadblock to reunification and set the rules of the game as 'majority wins'. Another stunning lack of foresight there, since demographic change has permanently erased the unionist majority.

Yes, this is impractical. This is why comparison websites are useful. It's not in my opinion anticompetitive not to appear on them though, since any customer of a company not appearing on comparison website can simply go on a comparison website to check the prices of those that do, and switch if appropriate.

&gt; The more expensive insurers don't like comparison websites because they increase competition.

Where's your evidence that the companies which aren't on comparison sites are more expensive?

You seem to be overlooking one important fact: comparison sites take commission for each sale. Being on a comparison site is a form of advertising. The major difference between advertising on a comparison site and advertising on TV, for example, is that on a comparison site you pay per unit sold, whereas TV advertising will cost you a flat fee (to my knowledge).

So in the end you have the party with the best image winning. 

Now of course this is wrong and shouldn't happen, but it does and will continue to happen. Unless politicians start being honest and telling people what they actually plan on doing and how they will do it people will carry on voting for Politician X (i.e. Nigel Farage) who simply promises to give them what they in spite of all the negative repercussions because he will use some bullshit statistics to back up his point.

All in all it's a sad state of affairs with no clear solution, but telling people to simply read more is not the answer.

null,false,kierdoyle,null,null,null,"A centre back who's better than Cahill, can slowly creep into JT's role, will eventually partner Zouma (possibly a certain Frenchman currently in Spain). 

I would also say a central midfield player, maybe not an out and out holding player in the Matic role, I think Mikel is suitable there, but the more creative deep lying player would be truly beneficial. Suggestions would be Pogba (extremely unlikely), and Koke (substantially more likely). 

Additionally I'd like a right sided midfield player, not necessarily a Hazard-esque winger, but an old fashioned player who's going to beat his fullback to the byline and get crosses into the box. We routinely lack width as a side, I think that would be beneficial, but obviously a world class winger would be alright too. Suggestions I would say Shaqiri maybe, seems like his work rate would be good, Reus is the obvious name but I genuinely don't know who too suggest as that role.

Overall we need depth, and when I say depth I don't mean young players who are going to be good going forward and will take some minutes here and there, we need depth that can slot into the first 11 in any match and do the job. The drop off from our first 11 to our second 11 (in midfield and in the attacking 3 is the most notable one, less so in the back) is considerable. You look at Bayern, or Real, or any of the top top teams that compete for everything year in year out, they don't stop adding players cause they're content with their side. They add because constant improvement is needed to compete on all 4 fronts year in year out. If that's our goal as a club, that's what we have to do.

Grab a vector file of the world (think of it as an outline map with each country being it's own ""shape"").

Average the direction being faced of the UK coastline at a certain scale every X miles/km and express that using 0-360 degrees. So now you have line segments with an average heading. Buffer each of those segments outwards until they intersect with another country, and then give each line segment that country as part of its attribute table.

By zooming in and out you could alter what distance in averaged, so if you zoom right into a bay, it might compute the entirety of the bay in 10m sections, but if you're zoomed out to the extent of the whole UK you might be looking more at 20km segments or more.",null,0,null,1420667522,null,0,false,0,cnhp46e,null,t3_2rjr3y,null,t1_cnhp46e,null,t1_cnh7dqr,null,null,null,1425003948,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

He has not gone back to the same job he had before. He earned £20k a week at Sheff Utd and if he would have continued his form for them would probably be earning double that now. Instead he spent two and a half years in prison and has apparently accepted a contract worth about 10% of what he was earning before. There are plenty of footballers who have criminal records. Neither having a criminal record, nor being a convicted sex offender impacts your ability to perform the role of a football player.

These unnecessary bits and overpaid bobs (Lallana, Markovic) could have gone into a really good bid for Bony who has PROVEN goal scoring quality. I even got ridiculed by fellow fans who said Bony doesn't fit our style, system etc. Does Lambert fit our style? Does Balotelli fit our system? Bony would have been PERFECT for us.

Urm, even the numbers are not good for France at the moment. And its not just the media, most analysts, investors and economists feel the same way.

I knew before I even clicked the link it would have that chart, its so ubiquitous and endlessly frustrating but I can see why its used. Its very easy for Joe public to see the French line is higher than our line, and who want to be eaten by the French!

However, the important thing is that it is indexed to before the financial crisis. So not only does it show the pace of the recovery but the size of the initial fall. I graph purely showing the recovery would be indexed to 2009, it is obvious to see that the UK was hit much harder than France due to our bigger financial sector.

The other thing to note is what the lines have done in the last 2 years, I don't think you will find many analysts, investors or economists who would rather be in France's shoes than ours right now.

Its just that LA/NY are better destinations for people who want to make endorsement money and live a cool rich person life than the random midwest cities that can offer comparable financial packages. 

MLS has a stated goal of parity. They may not always act in that interest, but LA cant just buy everyone a la Real Madrid. You get 3 big names and then a bunch of shit, just like everyone else.

- Two vouchers for free shipping during a season. It isn't a voucher code, so during a 30% off sale, you can use your free shipping and the 30% off code

- £10 voucher 

- Little season preview booklet and fixture list

- A One Hotspur pin

So if you were to place two orders from the online store, and use the £10 voucher, you would save yourself £37.98 (international shipping is £13.99).

To be clear: If it were me in the position of an accidental pregnancy as the result of my own choices then I wouldn't be having an abortion. But that's fine for me as I'm in a privileged position where raising a child is more than viable due to my monetary status and good mental state.

Does it not matter to you the context of why those women felt the need to abort those foetuses? Please be assured that I have no illusions to the fact a reasonable number of them were carried out for the sake of the parents just not wanting children due to mistakes. I do not condone their actions but I support the fact that it should be their choice to make the decision on whether they are capable of raising a child or not. Something a blanket ban doesn't take into consideration at all.

* Remy deserves to be second choice over Drogba. We all love Drogba and some people claim his hold up play is the reason he gets the minutes, but the reason we play that way is because Drogba is on. I believe Remy adds a bigger threat because we don't change our entire style for him. When Drogba's on, we play a long ball style for him to get the ball to his feet, hold up play and pass it on. With Remy, we can still play our fast paced style and be more clinical. 

* Those complaining about how Schurrle doesn't mesh in as well as Willian need to look at this. Of course he's not going have as good chemistry when he's had 642 less minutes (7 full matches worth) and mostly with lineups that aren't the strongest (cup games with lots of rotation players). He's been in terrible form, but people need to cut him some slack about not playing as well with the team or they need to stop with these false chemistry issues, implying the rest of the team doesn't like to play with him. 

* Zouma should get more minutes considering how shaky Cahill has been. If he's not as good as Cahill, then put Cahill back and it might even inspire Cahill. If he's about the same or better, give him a run of games to see if we're stronger defensively.

* Mourinho loves Ivanovic, but he really should try the Luis-Dave fullback combo. Offers the same bit mix of an offensive fullback and defensive fullback, but Luis is much better going forward and just as good going back. Plus, Luis has the pace to get back when a counter starts whereas Ivanovic is sometimes left behind since he's just not quick enough. The Luis and Hazard linkup play seems to be more effective than Willian and Ivanovic.

[Aqua Reward](http://www.aquacard.co.uk/MSMreward1) - 0.5% cashback, no surcharge for purchases abroad and (through this link only) a £20 Amazon voucher

[Capital One Classic Extra](http://www.capitalone.co.uk/creditcards/classic-extra-credit-card.jsf) - 0.5% Cashback and a £10 credit each year if you pay all your bills on time

My suggestion would be to apply for the Santander card (one application won't really impair your creditworthiness). If you are unsuccessful, then try one of the above cards.

As a fairly 'lefty' person, I do agree something needs to be done, but using emotion and feeding hate isn't the solution, it creates blind escalation leading to mindless violence which resolves nothing but pandering to groups who can whiled the most power. 

But I will shut up, if you can give a clear and outlined solution to this problem which isn't prescribed by a result of hate or emotion, but of reason and rational direction. Do we really need to go pre-enlightenment again?

That perfectly natural emotion when it comes to something as stressful/disturbing as such events, but I think people collectively grieving and show open contempt to these actions is far more civilised and reasoned then just firing off randomly like some total nutter.

&gt; Don't we need to rise up and become far more robust in defending Western values?

So we know 3% are covered for the reasons listed but which of the 97% would you deem worthy? What reasons aren't? Wrong sex? Wrong partner?  Etc etc

Yid is offensive as it stems from back when football fans were much more hooligan-esque (think 70s, 60s and 50s) and Spurs always had a jewish culture associated with them because it seemed as though they had more Jewish fans than any other team (probably so at one point in time, but questionable as to whether they *always* did). Anyway, when Spurs used to play another team the cunts of the opposing fans would chant ""yids"" at Spurs fans, which is derogatory whatever way you look at, even shouting ""jews"" at someone is offensive (idc what anyone says - it is). Spurs fans eventually spun this into their own thing in order to take the fans ammo away (so-to-speak) and referred to themselves as ""yids"" and eventually fans stopped chanting ""yids"" at them.

null,false,quantumpenguins,null,null,null,"OK, so some general culture you will definitely want to experience. I'm from the south, so a lot of this might not necessarily apply to the north, but it's all pretty much the same.

Food:

* Welshcakes. Essentially scone mixture with sultanas, flattened to about the size of your palm and shallow fried, the coated heavily in course sugar. Homemade they are simply stunning, but if you come to Wales then nearly every coffee shop or cafe will sell them.

* Cawl. This is a lamb stew full of potatoes, root veg (especially leeks) and lovely stuff. Best served with warm bread and welsh cheese. This is best bought in a cafe, generally one that boasts traditional welsh food.

* Welsh Rabbit. Not what it sounds like - it's basically cheese on toast with more flavour and a slightly saucier texture to the cheese(often called Welsh Rarebit). Some people reckon the name comes from the fact that if a poor man's meat is rabbit, then a Welshman's rabbit is cheese.


Sport.

* Rugby (often spelt rygbi, especially by welsh speakers, but it's pronounced the same.) Rugby is everything. The most heated derby is the wales-england game, but I would also reccomend going to see a New Zealand as well, just for the hacka. The atmosphere is incredible, not to mention the singing (I'll come to that later)

* Football, but only if you'll be coming to Swansea. Our team, Swansea City or just the Swans is the only decent one in Wales (sorry bluebirds...) and we like to remind people of that.

Music

Definitely listen to some traditional tunes on YouTube, though no one's expecting you to learn them. I'd say Canon Lan, Ar Hyd A Nos, The Ashgrove, Cwm Rhondda/bread of Heaven, Sosban Fach, and Suo Gan are the most well known. Also, try to get to know the National Anthem, Mae Hen Wlad Fy Nhadiau, of only so you know when to come in on the chorus. As long as you can shout ""Gwlad!"" with convition, you'll be sailing.

Also, listen to some Max Boyce - he's writen plenty of funny songs about rugby and welsh life in general. As its in English, I really encourage you to listen to ""Hymns and Arias"", as it has become a bit of a secondary national anthem, and is sung at most Welsh rugby matches (and at Swans games).

Lastly, watch a couple of episodes of Gavin and Stacy, a sitcom about a couple where the girl is welsh and the guy is English. Not serious culture but it gives a good idea about how a lot of south Wales looks and how the accent sounds, as well as language oddities. And by god is it funny.

Not everything in the list is necessary, in fact most of it is probably not, but if you really want to throw yourself in the culture then these are a good place to start.

This Doctor has range: he can be silly, playful, snarky, cold as iron and downright harsh, but he's a the guy I'd want driving if I got to travel the universe. Besides, under the protective armor of coolness, dry humor, and guarded reserve, there lurked a person of deep and conflicted feelings, trying to find his own way into his new life instead of trying to woo the natives with cuddly, sparkly high spirits.  Push comes to shove, and he goes straight for emotional bedrock: ""Do you think I care for you so little that betraying me would make a difference?""  It's a mater of taste, of course, but I'd take that over ""Clara, my Clara!"" any day.

And he doesn't give up because it's tough and even hurtful, trying to establish a working relationship with his companion, not always successfully (""That was me respecting you"", but not from Clara's perspective).  That's how he makes you know she's important to him -- he keeps on trying different ways to connect with her.

And that made Clara herself a much more interesting character, struggling to understand and cope with this formidable, alien person fearful and erratic in his new circumstances, but passionate at heart(s).  
Some of the stories were really strong (Flatline, Deep Breath, Listen), one (Mummy) was a gorgeous, shiny, set-piece of a mystery, and some were light on plot because what was more important was the interactions of the characters.  I thought the season was a great fistful of explorations in different styles and directions, with both major characters developing strength as it went along.  I've been re-watching some episodes and finding good stuff that I missed at first, every time. That, to me, is a good sign for the future.

null,false,ianrush88,null,null,null,"A couple of things I disagree with. Firstly we don't have a possession obsession, we have on average 55% possession which puts us 6th overall this season http://www.whoscored.com/Regions/252/Tournaments/2/Seasons/4311/Stages/9155/TeamStatistics/England-Premier-League-2014-2015 .

That level of possession puts us right in the middle of the better teams in the league. You'll notice in the english league that all the teams in the top 8 except west ham have 53-59% possession while of the crap teams only everton have &gt;50%.

It may look like our defenders are simply passing the ball around to keep possession, but I think it was more that until we moved sterling up front there was no mobility ahead and so no one to pass to. I also don't think Rodgers is putting style over results, its more that he believes his style of play is the best way to get results.

Which leads onto set pieces and atletico madrid's over the last aeason and a half. Especially this season with 19 set piece goals (only 13 in open play) already is ridiculous and in my opinion highly unsustainable. Stats people who look at these things suggest that set piece scoring tends to be pretty random, an example of this being us last season compared to this. Last season we scored an insane number of set piece goals, this season hardly any for the first few months. As much as people remember the fast break goals against everton or arsenal those wins were built on breaking the deadlock with set piece goals. I don't think Gerrard's delivery has got worse, or skrtel isnt attacking them as well, I simply think we had a freakish run last season that has dried up and shows how volatile it can be to rely on set pieces. As much as simeone is a great trainer, motivator and defensive organiser (at the expense of some creativity) I will happily bet that their set piece streak won't continue and their goals will dry up at some point.",null,0,null,1420680183,null,0,false,0,cnhwggq,null,t3_2rohsf,null,t1_cnhwggq,null,t3_2rohsf,null,null,null,1425000411,null,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3,null

That's such a simplification that it makes it almost impossible to have any discussion about it, because it sounds right.

But what does it mean? Who are we? That has to have some meaning. I think from our perspective we are a human rights loving, free, peaceful society and so our narrative is that's what they hate. Whereas from another perspective we are a resource hungry, ruthless, capitalist monster chewing up their part of the world, manipulating and screwing them over every chance we get - the capitalist way.

There is no justification for terrorist acts. The fact that some of the reasons are directly our fault, doesn't justify the attacks in any way. But it is a fact that ""who we are"" is defined by our actions, which seemingly to countries in the middle east, are not so good and seem to have a caused a mass resentment.

The real problem we have is not the extremists, it's the incompatibility of the Islam with Western ideals - that's the bit where ""who we are"" is relevant. For example the actions of today are not supported by the majority, but the banning of cartoons of Mohammed is supported by the majority, in direct contradiction of Western ideals. We don't seem to have an answer to tolerating religion, while also stamping out its ""wrong"" beliefs. However, I don't think those incompatibilities on their own would be enough for violence.

This is how these groups operated, they gain strength during war and conflict. Whenever there is a move towards peace they have to do something to stop it and turn up peoples hate again. All you have to do is look at any war zone right now and see how extremist groups gain control rapidly during times of turmoil. They love it and thrive of it and they want the same to happen here too. Just look at how rapidly ISIS has grown in strength and power due to the civil war in Syria and they gain strength by exploiting conflicts between Islamic sects like Shia and Sunni. 

The same thing happened in Ireland, the IRA and UDA gained power during the troubles because people flock to these types of groups during turmoil as a defence mechanism.

I'd not think like that.   Generally speaking I think Brits are welcoming to tourists.   We do get an awful lot, lots of people's jobs are supported by tourism, I think also many people are proud of the history/landscape/etc we have and 'secretly' love an excuse to show it off, tbh!  So if you're openly touristy but essentially polite and amiable, you get a positive reaction.  ""Oh cool, where are you from?""  ""Oh, it's your first time here?  Nice, what do you think so far?""  ""London's alright I suppose, but you should totally find time to check out &lt;my area&gt;...""  

Some cultures have sufficiently different norms that people may wholly unintentionally fail that ""polite and amiable"" threshold, but that's really not the case with you guys imo.  You have all the basic concepts of please and thank you, waiting your turn, chewing with your mouth closed, and I'd advise that reading up on the comparative intricacies of formal society etiquette will be a waste of time owing to the wide variations by class, time and geography in practice.

null,false,Peli-cant,null,null,null,"I'm very late to the thread, but I thought I would put in my two cents.  I think we need either 3 or 4 players to strengthen the squad.  We need a striker, obviously, a fullback for each side, and a defensive midfielder.  Here's who I want:

**Idrissa Gueye, 25, Defensive Midfielder (Lille)**

Gueye is my dream signing at this position.  He has 2 goals and 2 assists so far this season for Lille, but his main strengths lie in his defensive capabilities.  He makes 3 tackles and 2 interceptions per game, meaning he'd lead our team in tackles, and have the third most interceptions per game, while also being able to contribute offensively.  Because Lille has had financial problems this season, he should be available for around 4-7 million.

**Arkadiusz Milik, 20, Striker (Bayer Leverkusen/Ajax)**

Milik is a young striker on loan at Ajax this season and has scored 8 goals and made 3 assists in 11 appearances (8 started) in the Eredivise alone.  He fell slightly out of favor at Leverkusen and is reportedly available on a 2.5 million buyout for Ajax.  If we could manage to sign him for under 4 million, I'd be very happy, but the right circumstance would have to happen.

**Djibril Sidibe, 22, Fullback R/L (Lille)**

I'm going for the Lille double swoop.  Sidibe and Gueye will be out for AFCON, but they're too good to pass up on.  Sidibe kills two birds with one stone as he plays on the right and left.  He makes more tackles than Gueye and can also make a great offensive contribution.  He's been good this season, could fetch 4-6 million.  If we can get Gueye and Sidibe for under 15 million, considering its a double swoop in January, I'd take it.  

**Adam Matthews, 22, Fullback R (Celtic)**

Clear choice.  Local, talented, cheap, useful.  2-3 million.

**Window Total (Maximum Prices with January Bumps)**

Gueye and Sidibe: 15 million

Milik: 5 million

Matthews: 3 million

Total: 23 million

Profit: 7 million


Error:  I don't think Sidibe is going to AFCON, but I could be wrong

null,false,icStatic,null,null,null,"There are three types of green supporters, roughly speaking. 'Bright greens', 'Light greens' and 'Dark greens'. Bright greens believe in using technology to improve our lives and help save the planet. Dark greens believe technology has done enough damage and we should all grow our own food and wash our clothes by hand. Light greens are half way between - or something like that, read about it here. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bright_green_environmentalism

Yes it isn't as cut and dried as that but that's the general gist.

I'm a bright green. I believe technology is our ONLY way out of the mess. Dark green leads to societal collapse and mass starvation of people that grew up in the era of unlimited energy and a global economy.

My thought process is roughly this:

We're using too many resources, therefore we should stop. This is mainly because there are too many of us on the planet, or rather there will be soon.
Therefore, our population growth is our largest medium-term problem.
Therefore we should slow our population growth, and being lefties we believe we should do it passively - ie no genocide or forced sterilisation.
Birth rate is directly linked to education.
Therefore, long term the aim should be to increase education especially amongst the poorest, fastest growing nations.
Education is directly linked to energy consumption - and this makes sense because the more energy people are using the less manual labour they have to do, so they have more time to read, teach their kids etc.
The poorest nations will do whatever they can to meet their energy demand, and they will use the cheapest source of power they can to do it - ie coal.
Coal is a pollutant, therefore we need a new source of energy that is cheaper than coal.

So therefore by providing an energy source cheaper than coal you can reduce explosive population growth, stop overpopulation and massively reduce our burden on the Earth.

Now...

Wind and solar are extremely expensive sources of energy both in terms of manufacturing costs, raw resources and financial outlay. Many green groups spin them as 'job creators' because they need constant attention. 

The only way any green groups are able to successfully make wind and solar a large chunk of their energy mix is with storage technologies (that do not exist yet, and are obscenely expensive), and by turning off parts of the grid when the storage runs out (see smart grids). Economies don't stop just because the wind stops, and industry requires vast amounts of energy. I did some analysis on even domestic consumption and I think their savings calculations are way off - and I told them this multiple times. The numbers they have just don't, and can't work - and 'top scientists' are all shouting this. They're dead technologies.

So even if you magically balance the national grid so its completely green, you then have all those nice, new and efficient central heating combi boilers running on gas and all of industry still using coal and oil for things like smelting. You can't just fix the national grid, you need to fix it all - including all the fleets of cars. To do that you need even more power in your national grid, which you've just balanced. So you don't just need to balance the grid, you need orders of magnitude more energy, and even if you put solar panels on your windmills and covered the entire country with them, you'd still not have enough power.

The only proven 'green' technology that does not have the intermittency or reliability issues and can meet that kind of demand, is nuclear. All other issues aside, if you want to STOP climate change you need to so much surplus energy that you can start pulling carbon from the atmosphere.

If you ignore the stigma of the word nuclear and consider the current reactor designs, such as the Molten Salt Reactors, I think you'll find things have changed a lot. My 'grand plan' is a molten salt reactor in every town, maybe even one per street.

If you want to see one of many possible designs take a look at http://thorconpower.com/

Personally I would want to mass deploy the LFTR (google for Thorium Remix), I'd hand the plans out to every country in the world and have them being churned out by the thousands a year.

Just a few bonus features of the LFTR (and most molten salt reactors):
* They're walk away safe, they can't explode and they can't melt down - physically impossible as it already uses a liquid fuel
* They're MUCH MUCH cheaper to produce as they don't use high pressures
* The eat existing nuclear waste as fuel so it can reduce the existing stockpile
* The fuel is so prevalent it's literally in dirt, and the stuff comes up by the tonne when looking for other rare earth minerals used to make wind turbines etc.

By the way, I read a statistic a few days ago that said nuclear power SAVED approximately 1.8m lives by offseting pollution due to coal. ( http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/the-curious-wavefunction/2013/04/02/nuclear-power-may-have-saved-1-8-million-lives-otherwise-lost-to-fossil-fuels-may-save-up-to-7-million-more/ ) And nuclear waste is a non-issue, the amount of waste produced is absolutely tiny, especially compares it to the billions of tonnes of coal slag produced by burning coal. Don't believe me? ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=slag+heap&amp;es_sm=93&amp;biw=1200&amp;bih=1776&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-N-tVJDWKsSAU8aWgtAG&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ | https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=slag+heap+disaster&amp;es_sm=93&amp;biw=1200&amp;bih=1776&amp;source=lnms&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=feCtVODHOMWAUbb2gNgL&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAA&amp;dpr=1 )

Yes there are some problems that need ironing out with nuclear power (and LFTRs), but most of them can be solved in the next few years by throwing money at it.

You asked if I'm passionate about nuclear power, no I'm passionate about solving our planet's problems and I'm a pragmatist. If you take an ideological stance on fixing the planet you'll get nowhere.

He told us how surprised he was that someone would speak to him for so long and that people just walk past him and don't even treat him like a human being.

* As others have eluded to, when we are comfortably leading, Mourinho  likes to use Drogba for the last 10-15 minutes to be a ""false defender"" (if that term even exists) in the opposition half. Plus, Drogba is marginally better in defending set-pieces. But Remy needs to start domestic cup games. And when chasing the game, be used in a 442 or 4132 line up.


* Like Remy, Schurrle needs a good cup game run to find his form. I still think he is erratic in his decision-making and needs to learn to read the game better (see: Hazard).

* Mourinho doesn't like making big changes to his starting 11. When comparing EPL experience, Cahill should get the nod in league games. BUT, Zouma needs to start cup games.


* Azpi is a natural RB. Being right-footed, his deliveries look deadlier when hitting them in from the right. The reason Azpi has been played ""out of position"" is that Luis needs some time (in cup games) to get used to playing in a new team. We should gradually see Luis slot into the LB role. The issue now is where does Ivanovic fit in? Maybe challenge Cahill for CB?
