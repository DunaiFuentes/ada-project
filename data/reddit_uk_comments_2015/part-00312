Actually just e-mail them and ask whether it is worth applying, they  should probably be able to tell you if they accept non-standard applicants.

£8.50 an hour is well paid, imo. Although I mentioned it here on reddit one time and got laughed at for considering that a decent wage, so idk.

I was musing a few nights ago about how I've been working there for 2 months already and am not suicidal from the sheer drudgery of the job. Turns out I was right all along about retail being bad for me, as all the retail jobs I've had in the past have never failed to make me hate life within the first 3 days. I work in security now, as a concierge. Not only am I pretty content where I am, I also have more prospects ahead of me in the future. Where I currently concierge at a youth hostel, I'm getting valuable experience. I could be doing corporate security doing less work for £15-16 an hour in a year or two.

As for being meaningless... it can feel like it sometimes. I actually do very little during my shifts. However, in the meantime, I'm being 'a presence'. Someone to keep an eye on the place, keep the tenants in line with rules, be a human being they can talk to. So while I sit there being a living paper weight for 12+ hours, I'm playing an important role regardless, and I recognise what that role is. When I was stocking shelves, it really didn't feel like I was anything but a cog in a machine. Fair enough, without cogs, machines fail, but that whole thing could have been done by a robot. The job I have now cannot. If you tell a robot to lock a kitchen door at midnight, that door is getting locked at midnight sharp, with no flexibility.

They aren't abstract numbers. And yes of course a certain number of members logically are shit. But to some how jump to a majority are shit is a big reach and needs some evidence support. What historical cases are you speaking of? 

&gt;Nottingham Forest - 2 European Cups, more than any British club except MUFC and LFC. Where the fuck are they now? Think anyone outside greater Nottingham gives a fuck?

What does other clubs have to do with us? It also happened in a different era of communication and this sport.

&gt;Leeds. Champions League semifinalists, tons of fans...not anymore.

Once again you can't take other teams fans in completely different times and try to draw a direct correlation. 

&gt;People want a Premier League club to associate with and call their own. If that changes, they'll fuck off to the next thing. Ever try streaming a Forest or Leeds game? First, it has to be on TV first (many aren't.) And if you have gone through the trouble, you'll know the majority of these ""fans"" aren't going through the trouble.

Yes I can stream any game. The internet is deeper than you have researched.

&gt;Your argument is is crap either way, whether or not you believe the 135 million number. You've made my point for me. Don't know why you care so much about defending people who literally couldn't name more than a handful of players or remember the last trophy we won prior to 2005.

I'm not defending anyone. I'm simply stating your tiny number of people you are viewing is not adequate enough to draw the conclusion you are trying to conclude. Yes we most likely have shitty fans. Every team does. But to claim that over half of them are shitty is a stretch.

You could argue that both Xavi and Rakitic could play Stevie's AM role from 2007-2009. 

I think the point is a good one and interesting to think about, but IMO it's not something you could apply to Liverpool. Our DNA has always been a counter-attacking one. Our best sides were counter-attacking, and Barca for the last 10 years has been all about control and dictation, with their achilles' heel being pacey, explosive counter attacks (the clasicos during the Mourinho-Pep years were fabulous spectacles). We do have the personnel to play like that and a manager who has brought elements of it into our style, but there's a lot more going on than playing players who fit a certain profile, in a certain position for a certain formation. And our best season under said manager was as a devastating counter-attacking team using highly technical players.

We have one of the deepest and most technical squads in the entire league, but I seriously doubt we will deviate from what made us successful in 13/14 just on the basis of the concept of the One and Can being the player that could grow into that role with a frightening effect.",null,0,null,1439434595,null,null,false,0,cu16frt,null,t3_3gsa62,null,null,null,t1_cu10z5h,null,null,null,1440448292,null,2,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null

Our last two second-placed finishes have come with sides that were great at counter-attacking, but arguably didn't come first because they needed to be better at controlling the game - see all of the early draws in Benitez's 08/09 season, and then see the Chelsea game where we couldn't break them down (or, before that, games against Hull and West Brom - yeah, Toure's mistake costs us 2 points, but only because we were barely ahead).

That's why Rodgers brought in players like Lallana and Lambert last season, to help us break down sides that don't give us space to counter-attack in.

Mummy on the Orient Express (episode 8) is easily in the top 10 Dr. Who episodes, but most of the rest of the season falls flat with me.  Time Heist (episode 5) isn't too bad.  At least the plot doesn't have too many holes and the character development is pretty good.

Kill the Moon (episode 7) may be one of the worst episodes, and not just of the season, but ever.  None of it makes sense.  I can't decide if I dislike it or ""Love and Monsters"" more.

I gave up on the season after episode 9 and haven't watched the last couple episodes.  I'll probably catch them when season 9 starts.

Sure he was good against Stoke, but he spent most of the game matched up on Jon Walters. Don't get me wrong, strong and ""crafty veteran"" though he may be, he ain't the best wide man in the league. You wanna know how we kill the kid's confidence and stunt his development? Stick him in there every damn week until better teams with better players start to figure him out and he starts to get exposed constantly, which *will* happen if he stays in there. Then the crowd will gradually start to get on his back and he's ruined, cause he won't be able to cope with the pressure and the spotlight once he's getting skinned every weekend by more experienced wingers. 

Best thing to do is get Moreno back in and continue to give Gomez opportunities in games where he matches up well, thus growing his confidence and experience in a methodical way. As long as we have Moreno healthy (who is a highly talented and touted young player as well who we also need to be trying to grow), then there's no sense in sending a far less experienced player out there every week...it'd be sheer stupidity at the moment.

And, of course, all of this ignores the fact that he's supposedly weakest on the left. Giving him chances on the right and centrally would be better for him in the long term. Giving him an extended run at LB, his least natural position, likely just fucks with Moreno's development without giving massively appreciable gains to Gomez, since he's unlikely to end up in that spot in the longterm anyway.",null,0,null,1439435923,null,null,1439436204,0,cu174ds,null,t3_3gp4l0,null,null,null,t1_cu0w5m6,null,null,null,1440448614,null,2,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null

As to the argument about age, he was just clutching at straw to bring another argument in after he got called out on his BS.  I would have thought it would be much easier for a younger player to learn a new position than an older player.  I don't think think age has to do with it but whether the player can handle it.

Fact is we are trying to bring our young players through to the first team.  If they want to establish themselves in the first team, they would need to grab their chances with whatever position is opened.

Dave is young too and he is a DR but we play him as DL.  Kind of shoved him on the left but it works.  Don't see how age has anything to do with it apart from covering his BS.

null,null,daman345,scottish,Scotland,null,"&gt;But women earn about 70% of men's average income so there are indeed income inequalities between the genders. 

Only if they're over 35 though, and even then the gap is 17.5% overall and 9% looking at only people in full time work. Women aged 20-35 earn slightly more than the same age group of men. But obviously as you say paying for dates depends on the individuals and circumstances rather than overall statistics,. 

No idea why someone would think paying equally for a date has anything to do with treating people equally. Treating people equally should be something everyone does automatically; paying for dates is no more relevant than paying for beers or weed when guys hang out together. There's always a scrounger or someone who can't chip in for some reason, but no man assumes from that that its a problem with the entire male gender, because they see themselves and other males chipping in so know it just depends on the man. Why this logic goes out the window for some men, when thinking about women, is beyond me.

If one person never pays for shit, its a good reason not to treat them equally, but says nothing about how you should treat others of their gender, or race, or any other factor.

But it was actually part of the larger narrative of the season in which the Doctor was reexamining himself, his morality and his role in the universe. This was driven home by the exchange between him and Clara at the end of the episode. That line wasn't to talk down and explain to the audience what he was doing, it was to give us insight into what the Doctor is thinking about himself. At that point in Flatline, he sees himself as someone who is not necessarily a ""good man"" but the one who will do what needs to be done to stop the monsters. Hell, that whole episode explored this idea through him slowly seeing how he has changed Clara to the point that she is no longer his ""carer"" and is manipulating, lying and moving on quickly from deaths for the good of the group just like he does. 

So no, I don't think it's stupid. I do think there was some subtlety and even though I thought they were pretty in your face with this it seems like you *still* missed it. 

Similarly, the trailers are always kind of corny and I'll wait to see it in context. The trailer is just to get people to watch the show that might not otherwise. In the series 8 trailer there was a bit where they had the exchange, ""I've made many mistakes, it's about time I did something about that."" ""Where are we going?"" ""Into darkness."" Which turned out to be bits from completely separate episodes but had people bitching about the writing trying too hard to be edgy.

null,null,brakaza,null,null,null,"I don't think Swansea game is a good example. He was told to cover Montero so when Montero attempted to break free he followed. But he's not a seasoned defender and obviously doesn't have experience with making offside traps. So I don't think it's his mistake. It wasn't him swans exploited - Bane was the reason.  
As for positioning and viewing things. The way I see it, defending as a team requires players to cover specific zones. When team like Chelsea defends (organised defence), there are no free zones for opponents. So it's hard to attack against us. Opponents try to move the ball around as fast as they can to see if any zones open up. Usually we can keep up with them. So they try to take on player one on one (like Montero against Bane) or use counter-attacks. Willian is hard working player who can hold his position or specific opponent. Also he usually tracks back very fast on counter attacks against us. He's not tackler so he doesn't need to attempt it. His zone is covered so opponents pass the ball somewhere else. Oscar on the other hand is more proactive in defence. He likes trying to win the ball back. He runs at opponents, tackles, tries to intercept. But it often leads to unnecessary bookings, fouls. Sometimes when he misses interception he opens up zones. And he doesn't run as fast as Willian, so sometimes people run behind his back and he can't keep up.  
Overall I think Oscar has much more skills to win the ball from opponent, but Willian works harder to close positions and tracking back. And I think this is why Oscar misses a lot of big matches. Mourinho prefers organised defence against big clubs.

Historically we have a lot in common with Canada, but whenever I meet western European people, I feel like they'll understand where I came from a lot more than your average Canadian. Canada shares most of its modern, day-to-day culture/experiences with the USA, not Europe.

*  **The main sports here** are (obviously) Ice Hockey, Baseball and Basketball. A lot of people who call themselves sports fans consider 'Soccer' boring. If you say 'The Metz', everyone will know who you're talking about. If you say 'Bayern', 'Inter', 'Réal' or 'PSG', most people won't have a fucking clue.

* **Alcohol availability** is very limited compared to France/Germany/Spain etc. You can ONLY buy your booze from a couple of specifically licensed outlets, and there's a tiny, tiny selection for you to choose from. You can forget buying it from supermarkets or corner shops. That's strictly not allowed. Also, any notion of getting a bottle of wine for $5 is completely foreign. Alcohol is expensive. You also can't drink a glass of wine down the park while having a picnic with your girlfriend. That's illegal.

* **Tipping culture** is broadly the same as the USA, except you usually tip 15% instead of 20%. The barman took the lids off of both your beer bottles? Thank you sir! Here's a 2 dollar tip for you! 
The waitress brought your beer to your table? Thank you my dear! That'll be a a dollar tip.

* **The idea of popping out** of your front door and having a stroll down to the nearest corner shop/highstreet to get milk/tea/packet of digestives/baguette isn't a common experience. A lot of the streets in suburbia don't even have pavements. Why the fuck would anyone walk anywhere? How you do it is... You fire up your giant 'SUV' and drive to a giant 'strip mall' car park where all the shops are in a horse shoe shape around the edge.

* **If your mate lives in the next town**, how are you going to get there? The train? The bus? No, you're going to have to get a car and drive yourself. Outside of the cities, public transport is virtually non-existent. Railway networks here are designed around taking 2-mile long freight trains from one side of the continent to the other, not for fast passenger trains to zip between towns.

* **If you want to take a week off work** for a 'vacation' during your first year at a company, you can expect your boss to pull all kinds of grimaces and pained expressions, then ask you whether you take your career seriously.

Don't get me wrong, Canada is an amazing, beautiful country and the people are sound as fuck - but its culture is very different to any European nation.

Given what we know of Poche from one season of lineup decisions, it's only sensible to predict that he continues his trend of not being flexible and remaining confident in his personnel decisions. And I don't necessarily mean that as an insult, but rather that nothing happened during the United match that would suggest to Poche that his lineup call was incorrect.

The Dier midfield experiment and Dembele in the attack decision were both relative successes, and I think given the early stages of the season and the fact that Stoke also present a formidable attack means both of their defensive/possession contributions are needed. I could see Alli for Bentaleb but I don't think one giant mistake and one overall poor game warrants that.

---

This year our greatest weakness appears to be our squad depth, I'll try to keep this very short but give you a quick summary of each first team player. 



**Keepers**

- *Thibaut Courtois* - One of the best goalkeepers in the world at only 23 years old.

- *Asmir Begovic* - Signed this summer for Chelsea after club legend Petr Cech departed for Arsenal (Club rivals). Unbelievable back up who hopes to challenge Courtois for his starting position. 



**Defenders**

- *Branislav Ivanovic* - The Serbian bear plays on the right side of our defense and is known more for his ability to contribute to the attack then his defensive plays. Ivanovic is key to Chelsea set pieces as he is dominant in the air. Many believe him to be a weakness to our defense as he is often too aggressive and leaves our right flank exposed. 

- *Gary Cahill* - Plays in the center of our defense alongside John Terry. Some might argue that Cahill makes too many mistakes to be starting each week but I attribute most of these to Ivanovic being too far up the field leaving Cahill to cover the right.

- *John Terry* - Captain, Leader, Legend. John Terry could be the club mascot if he wanted to. Terry has been a Chelsea player his whole life and is a rock too our defense.

- *Cesar ""Dave"" Azpilicueta* - One of the best defenders in the world plays on the left side next to John Terry. Azpilicueta is unique due to his low to the ground defensive style of play.

- *Kurt Happy Zouma* - Zouma is what I would call a utility player as Mourinho plays him in multiple positions depending on what the team needs. His natural position is in the center of the defense and we all hope that he will end up being the future of our defense.

- *Baba Rahman* - The club hasn't confirmed that we have signed him, but Baba is one of the most young left backs in the world. Many hope that he will take over the starting left back role in the upcoming years and Azpilicueta will be moved out to the right (his natural position) to replace Ivanovic.


**Midfield** 

- *Nemanja Matic* - The worlds best defensive midfielder only rivaled by the purse class of Francis Coquelin /s. But seriously he is one of the best if not THE best defensive midfielder. 

- *Cesc Fabergas* - The maestro of our midfield Cesc is known for his ability to pick out passes that seem impossible.

- *John Obi Mikel* - Many believe he is past his prime and no longer first team quality. Mourinho often plays Mikel when he wants to guarantee that we do not concede. 

- *Ramires* - He is better in Fifa.

- *Ruben Loftus Cheek* - Promising product from the Chelsea youth team who has received much praise from Jose Mourinho. Even though many users of this sub have only seem him play less than 180 minutes of football they like to speak against Mourinho who has undoubtably seen more than 180 minutes of his game time.

- *Oscar* - Mourinho believes that this could be Oscars year to shine as Eden Hazard matured last year as a player. Oscar scored our opening goal this season against Swansea City and plays naturally as a center attacking midfielder.

**Wingers**

- *Eden Hazard* - Arguably Chelsea's most important player from last season's title winning campaign. Eden Hazard is known for his acceleration and ball control in tight spaces.

- *Willian* - Willian plays up and down the right side of the field contributing not only to the attack but helps cover for Ivanovic when Bransilav is out of position. Some argue that Willian needs a final product but I believe he fits his role perfectly and very few players in the world can do what he does.

- *Jaun Cuadrado* - Purchased from Fiorentina last winter and hasn't done much since arriving. Poor form has kept him on the bench behind Willian and many fans hope for him to move on from the club.

- *Victor Moses* - Returned from loan last season and looks to have replaced Cuadrado as Willian's back up due to his pre-season efforts.

- *Bertrand Traore* - Spoken highly of by Mourniho but probably won't see much playing time this season due to our depth on the wings. Traore is still very young and will most likely go out on loan sometime this season.

**Fowards**

- *Diego Costa* - Known for his fearless play style and willingness to pick a fight. Costa is a machine when healthy but has a hamstring injury which he can't seem to fully recover from.

- *Radamel Falcao* - After a disappointing season at Manchester United, Falcao has joined Chelsea on loan where he hopes to regain his previous Atletico Madrid form and enter the starting XI.

- *Loic Remy* - Scored key goals last season to help us secure the title and also hopes to challenge Falcao &amp; Costa for the starting striker spot.

I volunteered to be Quality Officer.  That meant I was in charge of the process manual for our office.  Every week I was sent a pack of new processes and process updates that were supposed to go in the manual.  There was a process for updating the process manual.  I ignored it and threw them straight in the bin.

Every year, the Quality Audit would happen and someone would come and interview me.  The conversation would go like this:

**Them**: Can you tell me how to [do something boring like order new printer toner]?

**Me**: No, I do not know how to do that.

**Them**:  Aha!  And what do you do when you don't know how to do something?

**Me**: I look it up in the process manual.

**Them**:  Excellent! [ticks box].  And where is your process manual?

**Me**: Right here on the Process Manual Shelf.

**Them**: Excellent [ticks box].  Can you look up the process for [doing the boring thing]?

**Me**:  Yes, one moment [flick flick flick].  Oh dear, we appear to be missing that process.

**Them**: Oh noes!  What would you normally do in this situation?

**Me**:  [turns to page one and points proudly] I would follow Process 001A - How to Order Missing Processes To Update  Your Process Manual.

**Them**:  Excellent! [tick, tick, tick]

That was the only time anyone ever opened the process manual and, as you might expect, I never actually got around to ordering the missing processes.  But every year we would get a 100% Super Excellent Quality Mark^TM all the same.

*FSG meet with Rodgers for the end of season review...*

Werner: Brendan, it's been a disappointing season. 

Henry: A group stage exit in the Champions League,

Ayre: Underperformance from the three Southampton players you chose to buy despite other members of the committee perceiving them to not be value for money,

Gordon: a poor performance in the FA Cup semi-final when we were favourites,

Werner: a 6-1 loss to Stoke City in the final game of the season,

Henry: An almost 50 percent drop in the number of goals scored,

Ayre: An increase in the number of goals conceded since your first season despite heavy investment in central defenders,

Gordon: and a drop from second to sixth in the Premier league.

Henry: So, based on all of that, Brendan, why do you believe you should stay on as Liverpool manager for next season and beyond?

Brendan: Your transfer committee thought we could replace Luis Suarez with Mario Balotelli.

That's currently the case, although at the recent budget the government announced they were planning to change the rules so that any emission-producing car would need to pay car tax. But that hasn't come into force yet and probably won't be back-applied to already-purchased vehicles.

&gt; What about regular yearly/biyearly/??? car checks?

Any car needs an MOT check on its third birthday, and then every year after that. It's quite a stringent test and it's illegal to drive a car that's failed its MOT.

&gt; How do we find a good second-hand car? We can recognize rust, and that's about it. It is possible to do a test drive and have the car checked at a garage? Are there special garages for this, and what are approximate prices?

Not garages as such, but organisations such as the AA and RAC will do car inspections and produce a report. Besides that, it's possibly also worth getting an HPI check which will search a number of databases to determine if the car has outstanding finance agreements or has ever been written off by an insurance company.

&gt; Insurance: can we buy a car without having insurance, or do we need insurance first? As we've never lived in the UK and didn't own a car in years it might be difficult to find an insurance company. But how can we insure something we don't own yet?

You need insurance from the moment you own the vehicle to the moment you sell it. The only exception is if the car is permanently on private land. If  a car is on the public road (even if it's just parked up permanently, not being used) and its uninsured it can be seized by the police and crushed.

&gt; Any good websites that list cars which are tax-free and for comparing insurance rates?

For insurance the three big ones are probably comparethemarket.com, gocompare.com, and confused.com. All have hugely-annoying adverts on the telly.

Necessary steps, as already discussed. 

&gt;making them, selling them only for them to be scrapped a couple of years after purchase is an incredible waste to human labour and natural resources, resources which could be put to better use.

I already agreed with this part and acknowledged it. No need to rehash.

Actually you need to flick back. I didn't bring it up, /u/34mbit initially linked the iPad to increased quality of life in our own society. You claimed it was disingenuous because he used the example of an iPad instead of an iPhone. I'm saying you're demonstrably incorrect.

Not at all.

Your only response to this was that he was talking about a different type of technology, which he actually wasn't. 

&gt;It's a strawman argument

Nope, it's a facet of your generalised argument. You have to consider all aspects of how this technology, developed through the incremental process you so denigrate, affects people's lives. It's essential, because the way you're portraying it right now is as a one-dimensional vehicle for all the ills of capitalism. That's rather disingenuous tbh.

3) Phone lines - All charges will be listed on the company's website. Don't forget to check the coverage map.

4) Banks - Charges and clearing times should be on their website. Be aware of what documentation you need to open an account.

5) Any hidden costs that may or may not pop up - Books, games, Netflix and Spotify membership, alcohol, cinema tickets... A lot of students fall down by not budgeting enough for their leisure time. Internet may not be included as a utility.

6) Clothes - You can shop to your budget here. Primark, Matalan and supermarkets are budget shops.

Checking the car is the same as anywhere else in terms of what issues to look for. You can get a test drive if you buy from a dealership but a private seller might be reluctant, although he should drive around with you in the car at least. You can (I think) pay the AA (a roadside recovery service) to come and look at the car with you. 

You need to insure the car before you buy it, or immediately when you become the owner before you drive. Insurance companies will allow you to set up a policy in advance. Eg if you were picking it up on Monday, you could sort insurance today to start on Monday. There's an official ownership form you need to fill in when you get the car called a V5, the seller can help you out with that though. You also need to tax the car yearly starting when you buy it, I don't know the exact limit but yeah some are exempt. It varies but for a typical car maybe £100 a year.

Not to mention the fact we've spent the last 25 years in relative obscurity, so don't have anything like the overseas market share that some other teams have.

Personally I'd rather see us sustain a top half finish, see if we can nick a 4th spot or a cup every couple of years than gamble our finances, or ownership to some foreign tycoon whose motives we can never be sure of. We've got exciting youth development and our football is showing signs of becoming vastly more entertaining than it has been in recent years.

null,null,stilldontknow2,null,null,null,"Cars which produce under 100 co2 are exempt from car tax at present. There are lots of medium size diesel engined cars which achieve this and some more modern small petrol driven cars manage it too. 

Your car will need to be insured and there's a plethora of choices but in your situation it might be worth looking out companies that specialize in people with overseas driving experience as many of the standard insurers may not insure you or charge a premium for doing so. If your car is more than 3 years old you will need to ensure it is MOT tested annually, it's a pretty comprehensive health check for your vehicle. 

You'll be allowed to drive for a year on your foreign licence but by the end of that year you'll need to have completed your test for a UK licence. You'd be advised to take some lessons with a qualified instructor to ensure you know what to expect during the test. 

Methods for buying a second hand car are from a dealer, private seller or car auction. Unless you have a mechanic friend or really know your stuff I'd advise sticking to the former of those options. 

Look for a car with a good service history, fewer owners the better and check if there are any outstanding loans against it or it's been involved in any major accidents. Sticking to a reputable dealer should minimize the risks involved but it's always good to check for yourself and once you know the registration number of your intended purchase it's easy to do online. 

Any good dealer will allow you a test drive and if they don't, walk away. 

Main things to remember is to make sure your car is taxed and MOT'd  if it's not exempt, get it insured and make sure you have passed your UK test before the 12 month foreign licence holder exemption is up.

So it's not really disingenuous to talk about how the iPad might provide someone with a tangible increase in quality of life in a discussion about iPhones.""

Nope, it's a strawman argument. I never argued the case for what you were claiming that I was saying, yet proceeded to say that I was defending such a case. That's a strawman.

null,null,pacifismisevil,null,null,null,"&gt;Yes. I never said they were occupying Gaza rather they are blockading it. Which is what they are doing. People within Gaza don't have the right to leave freely not to those outside have the right to enter freely. Similarly Israel patrols the coast meaning the fishing - one of the few sources of revenue left for Gazan's - is limited to zones 20km of shore and no further.

The reason it was mentioned was to show that Israel has no power to police Gaza's border with Egypt. I don't know you missed the obvious context... So Israel could allow in 0 goods to Gaza and wouldn't be morally right or wrong to do it.

&gt;Oxfam

[Not a reliable source of information](http://www.thecommentator.com/article/4684/explaining_oxfam_s_bigotry_against_israel). 

&gt;Most of the water supply is unsafe to drink and there are power cuts of 12 hours a day.

The fault of Gazans. [Israel left them good water supplies which they destroyed](http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/199256#.Vcw9uvlVhBc). Fuel shortages are because Hamas refuse to pay market rates. You still didn't answer - why should Israel provide them with anything? They are an enemy, they can get water and electricity from Egypt.

&gt;Because Israel occupies the land of Palestinians. Gazan's are Palestinians. What you say is equal to Israel capturing and occupying Kent, removing those who live there and then saying 'well there's lots of space in Russia, go there'. Similarly Gaza has been consistently reduced in size which each military attack by Israel upon it. Only last year the Israeli invasion pushed the de facto border back by 20km and destroyed all houses within that area (to create a so called safe zone).

All false. Israelis are just as much Palestinian as Gazans. 30% of Palestinians were Jewish prior to the creation of Israel. Whitewashing Jewish history in Palestine is anti-semitic. A lot of Arabs migrated to Palestine in the early 20th century because Zionist Jews were bringing prosperity. That the Jews decided to name their country something else and the Muslims kept the name Palestine does not make them the indigenous people, they are just Arabs as any other. 

It's more comparable to the partition of India. Hindus and Muslims didn't get along, so they each got their own part of the country. 14 million people were displaced in the partition of India, far less than were displaced by the partition of Palestine. The difference is that the Pakistanis accepted their country rather than trying to destroy India. [Jews and Muslims didn't get along](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1929_Palestine_riots), so they each get their own part of Palestine. It's happened many times in history. Muslims rejected the partition and invaded Israel a bunch of times, then Jordan &amp; Egypt occupied the rest of Palestine for 2 decades, then they lost another war against Israel and after that they decided to [invent the idea of Palestinian nationalism to destroy Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_nationalism#After_1948.E2.80.931964). To this day, Muslims control the holiest site in Israel and forbid Jews from going near it, calling it an act of war for Jews to pray at their holiest site.

&gt;Palestinians living in the occupied terrorises for example aren't Israeli citizens however they live under Israeli occupation (in violations of international law)

[That is heavily disputed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law_and_the_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_conflict#Jerusalem). Both sides want to occupy the other, just because Israel has the power right now does not make them more in the wrong. Being occupied doesn't give you a right to citizenship, Iraqis weren't granted American citizenship. Those Arabs who lived in Israel's borders in 1948 were given citizenship. Since 67 the borders are in dispute between both sides and residence or place of birth does not indicate citizenship. It's accepted by the international community that a 2 state solution will involve mutually agreed land swaps, and no right of return and Israel will never return to the 48 borders. The red lines of both sides are completely uncrossable, so there has never been a chance of a peace agreement and any negotiations are a sham.

&gt;The vast majority of Palestinians live in the occupied territories, Gaza, or displaced further afield in Jordan, Lebanon etc.

They are kept in refugee camps in other countries indefinitely, violating any norm of refugee treatment in history.

&gt;If Israel lets it have free trade with the rest of the world then it wouldn't need those supplies. 

Did you miss the bit where they have a border with Egypt? Israel legally controls the maritime border, and its own border with Gaza, it has nothing to do with the Egypt border. No country has a right to trade with its neighbours if they don't want to trade with them, Israel's providing of goods to an enemy in war time is worthy of extreme praise. Israel does not want to be at war, and knows that boosting the Palestinian economy is the best way to stabilise the conflict. Hamas in turn try to destroy the economy so that Gazans will be unhappy and blame Israel.

""Shaer said Hamas was using materials brought to Gaza for reconstruction and rehabilitation to rebuild terror infrastructure and execute terrorist activities, and that Hamas leaders ordered operatives to use homes for weapon storage, including his own home.""

&gt;The Israeli's have taken most of the water supply out of the hands of Palestinians and most of the best arable land. 

False. Israel has provided more than enough water to the Palestinians, as agreed in the Oslo accords. 150-200 million cubic meters of water a year are available to Palestinian Arabs, virtually for free, with only changes to policy and accepting help from the West. They are refusing to take it. This proves two things: 1. Palestinian Arab leaders don't care about their own people. 2. Rather than act as a peace partner, Palestinian Arab leaders prioritize demonizing and damaging Israel in the international arena. 

West Bank settlers consume 1.7 times more water per person than Palestinians, which isn't abnormal when Israeli GDP per capita is 10 times higher. Israel has [the best desalination program in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desalination#Israel). Palestinians are free to create their own water systems, and they end up wasting the water and then people like you blame it on the Jews.

&gt;Israel is worse than apartheid ever was (and I've heard and met many anti-apartheid activists who say it).

Anti-apartheid activists aren't necessary moral people. [Read this](http://www.aish.com/jw/me/Israel_Sudan_and_Me.html). Israel is actually the least apartheid-like country in the middle east currently.

The Israel-Arab conflict is one of the least significant conflicts in the world, and the only reason that the world is so concerned with it is because it involves Jews. It's the 48th most violent conflict post WW2, and in 2014 with its most violent year ever it was only the 14th most fatal conflict of the year. The much greater conflicts in the rest of the world are widely ignored because there is no obvious evil Jew to blame for the problem.

&gt;I've been to the racist state called Israel

Neither Arabs or Jews are racial groups, both include black and white people.

&gt;I've seen the separate pedestrian zones

It's obvious why they have separation, it prevents terrorism. Just a single checkpoint in the west bank found over 80 people trying to bring bombs into Israel in 2013. In 2015 so far, Israel intelligence has foiled 17 suicide bombing attacks. It's not racist, or Palestinian citizens of Israel would be separated too. They are not. They even choose to [serve in the army](http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=5727).

&gt;the separate ambulances and licence plates reserved for Palestinians.

Israel provides medical care to anyone. [The leader of Hamas sent his own daughter into Israel for free medical treatment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_in_Israel#Palestinian_medical_tourism). During last years war, Israel operated a medical facility at the border that had capacity to treat thousands every day. ""There was opposition on the Palestinian side to injured civilians receiving treatment in Israel thus the hospital stayed almost empty."" They even treat wounded Syrian terrorists at the Golan border. Cannot find any source on google that says Palestinians cannot be treated in Israeli ambulances, of course they have their own ambulance system in the west bank and Gaza.",null,0,null,1439451018,null,null,1439451433,0,cu1d29o,null,t3_3gplva,null,null,null,t1_cu0i7kl,null,null,null,1440451479,null,0,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

Personally, I'd rank a number of factors way, way above the smoking ban as reasons why pubs close:

* The antics of PubCos like Spirit and Punch.
* The fact that many pubs were, quite frankly, shite.
* More diverse leisure markets.
* Increased cost of living.
* Increased take-up of multi-channel TV (in the 90s, the chances are that to watch the game, you went to the pub. Now, more and more people access Sky Sports at home).

I'm sure I can think of others. 

Plenty of pubs around here are absolutely thriving and the ones that have closed were the shite ones that nobody misses anyway. I can only think of one of my locals I liked that recently closed, and that was because the PubCo fucked the landlord into the ground.

Sweden runs a flat rate of 33% income tax: most British people would be paying more tax in Sweden (median salary here is ~£26,000). Norway taxes at 28%, again meaning the average Norwegian pays more in tax than we do. 

Bagging on ""the rich"" is both a hallmark of the left and doesn't require a single bone in your back to do, because saying you'll raise taxes on the 1% isn't even remotely the same thing as saying you'll raise *everyone's* taxes: lower, middle and top earners.

Socialist countries tax people a lot more. All people, not just the rich.

null,null,pacifismisevil,null,null,null,"&gt;Israel completely disagrees with the two state solution in practice.

[Nope.](http://i.imgur.com/OnTCs9n.jpg). Only if you're going to argue that in practice a two state solution requires that Israel give the Palestinians the right of return, which destroys the whole point of Jewish right to self-determination.

&gt;Why are they evicting Palestinians from land they've held for centuries to make way for Israeli settlers?

That rarely happens. Settlements are built on non-privately owned land and any new settlements get demolished. Only already existing settlements get expanded to keep up with natural population growth. There's no such thing as an Israeli settler, they are Jewish settlers. Muslim-Israelis are not called settlers if they live in the West Bank which is obviously anti-semitism, so don't try to hide your anti-semitism by saying Israeli. Israel is willing to ethnically cleanse some Jews from the west bank (as they ethnically cleansed Jews from Gaza in 2005), but not all, and the position of ""67 borders with land swaps"" is supported by Israel, the USA and UN.

&gt;Why has Israel with the backing of the US, blocked the creation of a Palestinian state so many times in the UN. 

Because a Palestinian state must be created by negotiation on the various contested issues, Palestine has no power to just declare they will make their state with everything they want.  They are not going to get Jerusalem and they are not going to get the right of return, and they will never give up on those 2 things so peace is realistically never going to happen. Israel would be delighted if the Palestinians declared their state if it gave up Jerusalem, gave up the right of return and gave up any claim on the largest settlement blocks. They dont do that, they declare their state on disputed land and [demand that all of Jerusalem be theirs](http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.568060).

null,null,Kitchner,cnty-wales,Wales,null,"As someone who's job involves looking at processes, controls etc let me say often the wages for people working in finance are justified. 

I categorise finance people into a couple of pots:

""Strategic"" role are basically roles in finance that decide or help decide the organisation's financial strategy. This can include things like ""OK we want to fund a new development project how do we fund it? A loan? Sell more shares? Shall we use some of our cash?"". Without getting into the detail these decisions can make or break a company. 

""Specialist"" roles are ones that require a huge amount of expertise in a complicated and niche area. If it's really niche they will be a contractor who charges through the roof for their services because companies want to hire someone for their advice but doesn't want them full time. If it's less niche the chances are their knowledge costs or saves the company a shit ton of money. Two of the highest paid roles like this in any company will be a tax manager and a credit risk manager. The former because their tax strategy is the difference between saving millions of pounds or getting caught doing something illegal. The latter because your credit risk strategy directly links to how much money you make and lose, and a poor decision in a credit risk strategy could result in losing millions of pounds. 

Finally you have ""Control"" roles. These roles basically just exist as a control in a process. I submit a purchase order because I want to buy something. Someone checks it.   Accounts need to be submitted? Someone checks them. Invoices recieved? Checked. 

In my experience it's not uncommon for companies to hire over qualified staff for this role. You do not need to be an accountant to check a purchase order or an invoice. You could take someone from college and teach them how to do that (though if they want their boss' job they will need to be an accountant so it would limit their career options). 

The reason these guys are paid more than it looks like their job is worth is one simple question:

How much would you pay to make sure someone is checking your invoices worth £20m every year? 

Because when you have someone making sure you're spending £20m properly, a 20-30K wage seems like a good deal. 

The last role is the one that  in my experience people find the most me noiseless though. You exist as part of a process to make sure the process works. When I process map the process you're a box on it and that's about it. The better software used by the organisation though the less of these jobs there are. 

I mean I don't think my job is meaningless and objectively you can easily point to where I've sparked positive changes in organising. However my old manager feels the job is pointless as after 10 years doing it his attitude is no one cares about your work when you're gone. You build a building and it stays there, I write a good report and in even 5 years time I guarantee no one even remembers it.

My first choice was ACB for geography at the University of Nottingham but I only got BCD. They gave me sociology as an offer. I decided to accept it so I could use it was tool to try and get a place at other unis because to them I was just a walking £27k. I phoned all of my choices again and explained how Nottingham gave me an offer I didn't want and I would much rather be somewhere else. 

I then tried Sheffield which was a place I never considered due to the AAB entry requirement. I tried my luck and they phoned me back at 4 to confirm that I would be starting in September. I had also received other offers from Russell group universities.

So it doesn't matter too much if your results don't bang, just keep trying. I woke up with no places and went to bed unknowing that Sheffield would be the best fucking choice I have ever made.

Kendall is the other exception, but she seemed to decide that adopting opposite stances on policy to the majority of the party in several emotive areas of Labourism (support for Palestine, punishing the poor, immigration) was the best way to win an election among those same members. Baffling.

What it shows above all else is that the leadership campaigns other than Corbyn's would be likely to run an awful general election campaign. Despite the Blairite mantra of 'only we know how to win' they, and especially Kendall, show no practical understanding of how to win an election. Rule 1 - know your electorate and butter them up!

&gt; If queerism is so great, let us know why. If multi-culturalism is so great, let us know why. Put yourself in the firing line, as I have done and accept responsibility instead of accusing your opponents of other abstract nonsense like 'racism' of 'homophobia'. Come on let's be having ye!

What is a party? I always assumed that the different parties espoused different ideals... Labour were traditionally left, Conservative right etc... Now recently that's changed with Labour erring more to the right. Clearly that was popular.

But why was there a change? What shifted? Was it the Labour MPs? Or the Labour voters?

They want to sell you insurance and they will try their best to give you a good price over the phone. 

So give them any information you can think of, and try to get letters from your old insurer stating years of no claim etc. Also, get yourself a UK driver's license. I was able to transfer mine straight over because I'm from Australia.

However, for the reasons set out in my longer post this is not quite correct - your tenancy does not end on Monday. The landlord's notice of his intention to seek possession expires on Monday. That is fundamentally different. A landlord cannot end a tenancy, only a tenant or a court can. 

Basically you can carry on as normal, and wait for legal documents and then a Court order (which would likely give you two weeks notice). The landlord can only commence proceedings on Tuesday when the notice has expired. It would very likely take him past 30 September, so try to convince him not to bother as if he does there may be some costs implications for you (maybe a few £100). Read the points in my other post about possible risks and solutions (eg changing the locks temporarily). 

If anyone tries to throw you out without a court order phone the police. They will try to say it is a civil matter but that is not correct, it is criminal - both for the attempted eviction and for trespass, and potentially harassment.

I would call Leeds later in the week and chat to them about it, work out your options. Today they'll be really busy so not worth the time on redial. 

One question, why are you not going to take the B subject on to A2? If doesn't matter if it's not particularly relevant so long as you have the required subjects. If it's something you are better at I would recommend it to lighten your load a little.

I'd also talk to your school, get some advice from them on your A2 choices and find out what support they can offer you. There may be help they can give that you don't know about.

Finally the whole 'top uni' thing, this largely exists because newspapers love league tables, they mean they can quantify everything and put things in order. What you really want to know is whether a degree will get you where you want to go. For example there are tons of forensics courses out there and very few jobs actually working in that field. The majority of their graduates go on to do other things. If Leeds turns out not to be an option start looking around at other unis, ask them the difficult questions like 'what do graduates of X degree actually go on to do?' try to get some stats that are important to you and use that to make a comparison.

I think this should probably be stressed more, as it's a completely legitimate thing to do.

Cut state funding for places on courses like Media studies or Film or stuff, so only those who are best can get into them, and we don't have thousands of unnecessary people taking positions on these courses when it's a waste of their time and tax payer money.

Germany has a good system iirc where, based on assessments through school you're allocated a ""career path"" that determines whether you go to a technical college or academic university.

It's a bit unusual as they are only open Friday and Saturday night. You have to book in advance and choose your table and you have to turn up about 7pm and you're there until 10:30. Also you don't get a choice of what you're eating.

Basically, what happens is that all 30ish customers eat the same 5/6 course meal and it all comes out at the same time for everyone. The chefs come out before each course and do an announcement of what you're going to be eating and everything is plated where you can see it being done.

So, it is quite unusual, but the food was absolutely phenomenal. I mean, I love cooking and so a lot of restaurants I go to and think ""I could do this at home without too much hassle"", but this restaurant I knew I'd have no chance of creating a lot of the things there to anywhere near this level. (as an example, there was a sea bass tartare with crispy skin as a pre-starter thing and it was so good I decided to emulate it at home and it was just nowhere near as good).

So, yeah, highly recommended. It's £39 a head for food and then drinks are on top (be warned, they're not cheap as all the wines are local organic wines, so it's about £24 a bottle), so assuming even assuming 2 bottles of wine (We were there for 3 1/2 hours, don't judge me) + tip, it came to about £150 for a couple, which is definitely expensive but I felt was worth it.

Bleh. Just read that back and I sound like a sales rep for the restaurant.

&gt; Because the truth is that Jeremy is offering old solutions to old problems, not new answers to the problems of today

But earlier in the article, we have

&gt;  Cooper, the only trained economist in the race, will describe his plan for further quantitative easing as “really bad economics”, saying “no good Keynesian would ever call for it”

Wat.  Even if you don't agree with Jeremy's QE—and I take it Yvette doesn't, and thinks that [no true Scotsman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman) would agree either—it is most certainly not an old solution (yeah, we've had QE before—for banks) and it addresses something that is most certainly not an old problem (lack of investment across the board is a thing that's happening in 2015, not 1983).

Also, I love the fact that Yvette's decided that the best thing to do is to go on the negative and attack the shit out of Jeremy's platform (at least I suppose it's his platform and not him today), instead of playing him at his own game and demonstrating the positive benefits of her own position.  And she and the others wonder why this contest is so one-sided.

&gt; It’s not enough to be angry at the world. We’re the Labour party, we have a responsibility to change the world or what’s the point of us at all?

Dare to change it then.  One of the reasons Jeremy is vacuuming up support is that, whether or not he actually _can_ change the world, he's doing a very good job of convincing people disillusioned at Labour's record in opposition (and I suppose towards the end of government too) that he is the one that gets this the most.  He has convictions, ideas based on those convictions, documents based on those ideas, speeches based on those documents.  And they resonate with people.  We can argue about whether they'll work (and honestly I think Jeremy would want us to, because he's not conceited enough to think he has all the answers, see also his openness on the Northern Future policy track), but you can't deny that they electrify people the way Cooper, Burnham, and Kendall's don't.

Ooh.  Incidentally, a point.  If the voters really think ‘wow, that Cooper/Burnham/Kendall has great ideas and I want them to lead the party’, surely they'd join as a registered supporter?

What course are you doing?? Might be worth to see if it's done in any EU universities...quite a lot will teach courses in English especially those in Scandinavia/Netherlands.

Just do as many past papers you can find, old syllabuses are very similar to the current ones, so you can do those. And afterwards go through them with the mark scheme and find what you need to do in order to get full marks. If you had no clue you need to find where that is on the sylabus and highlight it and do extra revision/ask a teacher to explain it!

Also universities take into account your predicted grades that the teachers input into UCAS as part of your application, so sometimes you can get your teacher to bump you up a grade (if it is doable) to help with applications!!",null,0,null,1439459742,null,null,1439459926,0,cu1f9b7,null,t3_3gtnxq,null,null,null,t1_cu1epuw,null,null,null,1440452513,null,2,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

I feel like the ref totally ruined that game with 2 horrible decisions (Jerome goal &amp; Bassong pen). However, I think we looked very nice when Jerome and Redmond came on so I don't feel to distraught, had it not been for the ref I feel we would have won that game.

&gt; The appointment of Alex Neil in January had a massive impact on results. How do you think he will handle himself in the Premier League?

I think he'll do well, great motivator, much more positive play than previous managers. The only thing I'm worried about is that he's not very experienced in the transfer market and from the players we've been linked with I think we could see one or two panic buys who flop.

&gt; Who are the Norwich players that fans should be keeping an eye on this season?

It's got to be Redmond, he's been showing a huge level of improvement in my eyes, but I can see him breaking my heart when he's linked to a move away at some point. Apart from him I've got to go Tettey because I love him.

&gt; You’re rumoured to be looking for a striker at the moment. Who’s on your shopping list before the window closes?

We're linked to quite a few strikers who aren't really good enough in my opinion, Dwight Gayle (I don't think we should be competing with Bristol City for players), Glenn Murray and Ross McCormack (...). Mattia Destro would be an interesting signing, though, if it wasn't too pricey then I'd be excited to see what he can do for us. Apart from that we desperately need a cb, I don't know who I'd want but I think we need a cb more than we need a striker, someone with good experience and isn't slow off the mark.

&gt; The last time both teams met, the game finished 0 - 0. What’s your prediction for the game?

I think this is a game we really should be winning, but I have to say, looking at your defence, it's got to be 3-1 or 3-2 to us.

&gt; Sunderland are one of the favourites for relegation. What are your thoughts on Sunderland’s chances this year, and what do you make of their squad?

yeah soz, but I see a season of struggling and Alan Shearer having a section on the Sunderland defending often.

null,null,captf,Scotland,XJ6 Manchester,null,"Assumption here, by the way: you're on a 125?

Generally, you won't shift multiple gears at once. At least, not without bringing the clutch back out again briefly.  
A bike isn't a car, and has a sequential gear box - you *want* to engage each gear unless unavoidable.

How I do it is, when I'm slowing down, I wait till my revs have dropped to ~2k before dropping a single gear. Let the clutch out to at least the biting point, so that the engine can now be brought down to the right speed. If I'm still slowing down, I'll bring the clutch in again and drop another gear.  

The goal is to drop to a gear where the revs are the same as when you were last cruising.

When you change gear, what's happening is the spinning of the wheel - and your speed - are briefly driving the speed of the engine until the resistance of the engine takes over and slows you down. The revs are related to this speed, with lower gears having higher ratios.  
For example, a [hypothetical] bike could have it such that in 4th gear, 30mph is 4500 revs.  
Dropping to 3rd gear will still be 30mph, but now up at 6000 revs.  
2nd gear at 30mph would be 8000 revs.  
If you stop briefly in 3rd, it will cause the engine to attempt to slow you down to the 4500 revs it was previously at. It won't get all the way, unless you don't shift out, but it'll drop you down a decent bit. For example, it may get to 5200. So, when you went to 2nd, you'd only be at, say, 7000.

And 4th gear in a car park [""parking lot""? You're not American! :p [edit: oh, maybe you are...] ] sounds way too high. On a 125, you'll be needing to do about 30mph at least for that sort of gear!

&gt; So for a scenario lets say im riding down the dual carriageway at gear 4. I notice traffic starts slowing down so i decide to shift into second gear. I pull in the clutch and let go of throttle then down 2 gears let go of the clutch then boom rpms just skyrocket.

Yup, it will. As described above.  
And, to go down 2 gears here, the traffic would have needed to suddenly stopped. On a 125, 2nd is a ""I'm going sloooooooow"" gear; ~10mph

Also, Instinct here is telling me that you drive a car too?

Let me tell you my story about being in STEM; I hope this will help some of you looking at ""The Wrong Grades"".

I finished secondary school with the equivalent of BBB (first disaster) in 2000 and luckily got a place a Russell Group university through clearing. I dropped out of my original course after one year (second disaster) and switched to a different course in the same university. I eventually graduated with a 2:2 (third disaster).

I found a 10-month paid internship in my field, which gave me some real world experience. I then managed to get a research assistant position at a different Russell Group university, which helped to pay for an MSc. 

I then returned to my original university for a Ph.D and now I work in a Dutch university as a scientist.

Yes, there may be a slight element of ""survivor bias"" here, but the point I'm making is that you probably have more opportunities than you realise.

null,null,RKanharn,null,null,null,"&gt; What did you make of your opening day defeat to Crystal Palace?

We should have nicked a draw if it wasn't for that disallowed goal I feel, on the whole though Palace were the better team but it could have been worse.

&gt;The appointment of Alex Neil in January had a massive impact on results. How do you think he will handle himself in the Premier League?

He'll be fine, he's play positive, attacking football that we haven't seen since Lambert was in charge and I feel with another decent signing or two we'll be fine.

&gt;Who are the Norwich players that fans should be keeping an eye on this season?

Nathan Redmond is the only real game-changer in our squad, you could also argue that Hoolahan or Jerome may turn the screw when needed but these are the players that opposing clubs will need to look out for.

&gt;You’re rumoured to be looking for a striker at the moment. Who’s on your shopping list before the window closes?

One of Mattia Destro/Ross McCormack/Dieumerci Mbokani/Dwight Gayle/Glenn Murray and hopefully a CB.

&gt;The last time both teams met, the game finished 0 - 0. What’s your prediction for the game?

It all depends on Sunderland's attack, both sets of defenders look a touch dodgy and I think we'll score but it will be down to whether a player like Defoe can nick a goal or two. 1-0 Norwich.

&gt;Sunderland are one of the favourites for relegation. What are your thoughts on Sunderland’s chances this year, and what do you make of their squad?

I think their defence still needs a bit of work and the first set of games isn't really enough to tell but I think it will be Sunderland/Villa and the promoted three fighting it out.",null,0,null,1439461216,null,null,false,0,cu1fm1b,null,t3_3gr42o,null,null,null,t3_3gr42o,null,null,null,1440452746,null,2,null,NorwichCity,t5_2sv0y,2,null

AS grades are not the end of the world. Speaking from personal experience - I got CDE at AS-level and i ended up with ABC and a place in a top-10 Russell Group uni. You certainly can still get into UCL.

Use what you feel now as a motivator for next year. For me, it was a summer school - whenever i was tired, or didn't want to revise, or felt like giving up, i thought back to my experience and it pushed me on.

BBBC is not a bad result at all.

 * You are the person who could be deemed to have been negligent or at fault in the event of the crash. Thus, it's always OK to summon you personally - you're expected to get your insurance involved in dealing with it if you want them to pick up the bill.
 * The insurers will pick up the bill if you lose, as long as you get them involved ASAP and follow their instructions. Section 151 of the RTA makes them liable to pay out if you lose, unless you meet one of the exceptions in section 152 (which boil down to not telling them about the summons, lying to get insurance, or cancelling the policy).
 * Because the insurer is liable, bailiffs will not normally come round to your house - they'll go to the insurer's offices instead, as there's more money there. If they do come round, they're likely to clear off quickly upon discovering that there's an insurer to pursue; should you lose, ensure that your parents have your insurance details near the door, to give to the bailiffs.
 * Your insurance will take over full control of the court case. That's what they're there for, and they're the ones who'll have to pay out if you lose. As long as you follow their instructions, they're on the hook for your liabilities; if you think they're doing something wrong, or if their instructions don't make sense, ask them to clarify.",null,0,null,1439461749,null,null,false,0,cu1fqol,null,t3_3gqvni,null,null,null,t3_3gqvni,null,null,null,1440452806,null,1,null,LegalAdviceUK,t5_32g6u,1,null

In light of the claim being related to a sexual assault, I would assume that she has suffered enough to get such medical evidence for her and therefore protect her as much as possible. If it is a criminal matter, they are more geared up to facilitate this but the civil courts have options for her too. 

If it is a civil matter, then we can say that the majority of cases do settle and never even get to Court so it is likely that getting a Solicitor involved is her best option to try and deal with everything on her behalf and handle everything so she doesn't have to. A written witness statement should be all that a law firm like ours require to deal with matters for her and we will avoid having to ask her to go over what happened to her any more than just the once.

Dier played well in midfield against United, plus he's defensively disciplined, which we'll need against the Bojans of Barcelona-on-Trent, and can kill and eat Charlie Adams when no-one's looking.

Bentaleb because he's a real talent and anyone can have one bad game, but if he's sloppy again, then off for Alli or Mason at half-time.

Stoke are well-organised and I don't think Dembele's pressing makes up for his attacking mediocrity in games like these; Lamela's improving every game and is less predictable.

Well, how about because when you take money from the big, bad government, it doesn't just disappear, that's money that someone else CAN'T have now. Someone who needs it. 

If people can't learn to fucking share, then no-one gets anything.

I'm currently working but entitled to a number of benefits because of how much I make and where I live, etc. I don't claim a single one of them, because I make enough to pay my rent, keep me fed and watered and have fun sometimes. 

I know plenty of people who would take the extra (I think) £3k a year just to drink away, or whatever, but that can't be how everyone is, or no-one gets any.

Anyone who says otherwise needs to go get some additional training RIGHT NOW and should not be handing out advice on how to ride on the internet.

Now, that's done, to business:

Imagine you're in 2nd gear at 7500rpm (for instance).  You speed up to cruising speed and change to 4th (absolutely fine riding, don't let anyone tell you you have to use third because you don't).    Watch the rev counter; it goes down (say to 3500 rpm for the sake of argument).  Now, if you're changing down at the same speed from 4th to 2nd, doesn't it follow that the revs would need to rise from 3500 to 7000?  This is why you often hear bikes 'blipping' the throttle on downshifts.  It's actually possible to lock the rear wheel if you don't blip on a downshift from a high gear to a low one.

Try this (it'll take a bit of practise but soon will be second nature):  Ride along at an appropriate speed in 4th brake to your second gear corner speed (or just shif gear for the sake of practice - make sure it's an appropriate speed for the engine of course), pull in the clutch lever and as you change down two gears, blip the throttle (in other words, rev the bike).  Do this quickly and bring the clutch out - if you've done it right it'll be lovely and smooth.  Don't rev and hold those revs, it's just a quick on/off, then back on the power as you engage the clutch.

It's easier in practice than it is to describe.  I'd wager there's a thousand YouTube videos about motorcycle rev matching. ",null,0,null,1439462884,null,null,false,0,cu1g0zu,null,t3_3gtzd7,null,null,null,t3_3gtzd7,null,null,null,1440452942,null,4,null,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,4,null

Don't do this. You can get kicked out for non-payment of rent irrespective of whether you've used it to fix the broken property you're renting. There's a [very specific procedure](http://england.shelter.org.uk/get_advice/repairs_and_bad_conditions/tenants_repairs_and_improvements/tenants_doing_repairs) you'll need to follow to be able to deduct the repair costs from your rent.

Making a scene at the estate agent's office and/or kicking off on social media will probably get you results faster unless you're renting from a slumlord.

I didn't say that they do.

&gt;performances there mean fuck all as Dave failed to understand when it came to the debates.

Dave still won the election though - although I agree that it wasn't entirely because he did a great job in the debates. However, I think Osborne would do better than Dave in any debates.

I also think Osborne did MUCH better in that PMQ session than Cameron has EVER done in ANY PMQ. If you watch, he didn't really attack anybody. He dodged less questions than Cameron too. He gave straight answers. And he really came across as centrist, and not some crazy ideological posh twat.

If he gets more TV time, he could win over a lot of people IMO.

&gt;Every single person who isn't into politics I know thinks Osborne looks like an untrustworthy, slimy shit.

He's getting much better now. He lost a lot of weight. He got a better hair style. He's been wearing more trendy suits that make him look like less of a cunt. All of that helps.

Honestly man, I think you underestimate him. Osborne will do very well.

Again, it seems odd to me to fault people for pushing for a movement towards greater representation in their own parliament. Why the upset? 

Are you saying that because a vaguely defined proportion of the populace disagrees - keen on Blairism/austerity - other people should be contented to remain marginalized? Or they should join a minority party maybe - a party with one seat to launch its opposition from, even though that party might represent as much or little of their views as Labour does? Should they not use this open opportunity to use democracy to get what they want, using Labour's own system to raise up Labour's own politician? I honestly don't know what you think Corbyn supporters, or people like me, should do. Shut up about it already? Just be happy to live in a society at all, even as it moves progressively further from your hopes, dreams and ideals?

&gt;This is a vote for remaining in opposition but having the Labour party you want.

That remains to be seen, but even if it proves to be the case it's not a prospect that I find hard to bare. It may prove to you that we're all nihilists or something. However, many of us are still trying to hold onto some kind of ideal, such that we're unlikely to elect a candidate like Cooper or Kendal to parrot in opposition the idea that the unemployed are the source of all our economic woes, even if - and especially because - they are just saying it to get some power.

Don't get me wrong, I appreciate your argument and the pragmatism behind this ""party of government"" angle most trumpeted by Blair, Campbell, et al.

It is GINI coefficient vs household disposable income, over time.

A right winger might argue that the increasing gini coefficient of the thatcher years ""set the stage"" for a compensating increase in disposable household income in the major and blair years - one that increased the wealth of all including the poorest.

Thatcher however argued it happened on her watch. I distinctly remember Thatcher during her PMQs even arguing that while the wealth of the rich had increased a lot, the wealth of the poor had also increased, so everybody was a winner.

null,null,Harrod200,null,null,null,"&gt; Any car needs an MOT check on its third birthday, and then every year after that. It's quite a stringent test and it's illegal to drive a car that's failed its MOT.

You can drive a car that has failed it's MOT *as long as the previous year's is still in date*, meaning if your car fails and your old one hasn't yet expired, you can still drive it around until the certificate expires. You'd only generally do this if you want to use a different garage for the repair works, or if repairs can't be done for a couple of days.

Some garages are more stringent than others; some will put some defects in as an 'advisory' and pass the car, while others will fail the car on those same defects.

Something that has not been mentioned so far is Gap Insurance. Typically, even the most comprehensive car insurance policy will only give you the current market rate of your vehicle if it is written off. This means that if you buy a car for £5000 and a year later it's written off in an accident, you may only get back £2500-3000.

I mean aside from his lack of technical ability, vision of the field, poor shot selection....he is a jackass. Walking yellow card, crier of rivers, fish flopper expert. His only redeeming quality is he can run, but he's essentially a marathon runner in a soccer kit.   

There is no defense of him. except for **the odd but loud vocal minority here in /r/chelseafc who mistake his work rate and energy for quality,** no other explanation as in soccer terms he rarely contributes anything of worth to those who know the role he's in. perhaps people cling to the one good year he had and a fluke goal in barcelona. But it's similar to saying torres won us the CL because he won that corner kick. consistently ramires has been very poor for us for three years running, how he's still in a job speaks to idiocy from the coaching staff or deals that didn't go through for a better player (a la witsel.) It's a position that has needed strengthening for three years and he's still stuck to the club like a leech. 

I don't have to subscribe to your notion of what a fan is. If it's blind support of every player on the roster than that's just sheer stupidity and an insult to the game. He's a player that is not good enough for the team I support. I have no obligation to support him. If I walked into him in the street I'd tell him there is no man I've watched wear the blue jersey that I've disliked more than him to his face. It's a truth. Same as I'd tell curtois to stop relying on his height and work on his footwork. I'm a student of the game and always have been. 

and to have that dolt on our squad wasting space another player could be developing in baffles and offends me.  

So he can fuck off to whoever will take him and I will be happier for it. Seeing him with the flu at the end of last season was great because I didn't have to worry he'd end up in the XI.

null,null,Timmeh7,cnty-wales,Swansea,null,"Without question, failure to adapt to the change in didactic environment.  The first thing I do for every group of students enrolling on my first year modules is define the term ""autodidactic"", and understanding it is key to success at university.

An autodidact is a person who can teach themselves, someone who can self-direct their own learning.  Students starting at university should be under no illusion that one of the primary skills they're coming to learn, regardless of the subject they're enrolling on is how to be a successful autodidact.

This, for the majority, presents a massive paradigm shift.  Up until enrolling in university, the vast majority of teaching students have seen has been didactic; a teacher has given them pretty much all of the information they need, and any additional reading is laid out specifically.  It probably shouldn't be this way; ideally there should be a gradient through which colleges and sixth forms prepare students for university by gradually releasing the reins, but colleges and sixth forms are assessed by the performance of their students at exams, so frankly the teachers do a lot more hand holding than they should - good for the exam results, bad for the ability of students to learn, but that's another rant; it is as it is.  The fact is that students coming to university are used to a very different style of learning.

University is a totally different environment.  Students now have maybe 8-14 hours of lectures a week and an unprecedented level of personal freedom.  This is, however, a 2-sided coin.  Lecturers won't call or e-mail to find out why a student missed last week's lecture and ensure they catch up.  If you're falling behind because you're out converting your student loan into liver damage, your lecturer won't sit you down for a motivational chat.  And this sounds uncaring, but it really isn't the case; as a university student, **you are now in charge of directing your own learning**.  You motivate yourself, you go and do independent work to fully understand the lectures you attend - indeed the reason the timetable seems so mysteriously light isn't because the university knew you needed a spare 20 hours during the working week to perfect your noscope headshots, but because students should be at least doubling or tripling their lecture time in independent study time on related topics.

Now, that's definitely not to say you're on your own.  I have all the time in the world for students who are sincerely trying, but struggling to understand a topic - I have office hours every day, feel free to take up as much of my time as you need and I'll help you work through whatever you may be having difficulty with (including things I didn't cover during the lecture).  If, however, as a student paying a small fortune to attend university you don't care about your education, why would I?  The onus is entirely on you to take charge of your education - attend the lectures, understand the content, and use things the lecturer mentions but doesn't expand upon as breadcrumbs for further reading.  This is not something you can cheat, or something which you can find an easy way around - American films have lied to you; the 30% first year dropout rate is chiefly comprised of students who believe they can barely work through their first year and still pass at the end.

This is what students struggle with, the sudden paradigm shift from a didactic teaching style at A-level, to effectively being responsible for their own education at university.  Often those who struggle most are those who found A-levels easy; the change in level, pace of work and mind set is significant.  Absolutely manageable, but significant - take it seriously from week 1, find a good balance between academic and social life.  I recommend pulling a full working week, i.e. 9-5 (or 11-7... I know students don't do well with 9am), and scheduling your social life around that – of course, have a social life, enjoy what is for most the first time being away from home, but don't forget that you're paying £27k in fees, and ""losing"" probably £50k in opportunity because you're studying rather than working – take your education seriously.  Ultimately, just realise the paradigm shift is coming, take your education seriously from the outset, don’t underestimate the undertaking of a degree, but endeavour to find a good balance between academic and social and you’ll have the best few years of your life.",null,0,null,1439465735,null,null,false,0,cu1gtu4,null,t3_3gtnxq,null,null,null,t1_cu1fxg8,null,null,null,1440453320,null,31,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,31,null

Parents earned too much for me to get grants, but they ran their own business which had just moved premises and they'd just bought a derelict house which they were in the process of renovating (themselves, while we were living in it). This meant they didn't actually have anything spare to contribute.

My grandparents offered to help out. Their offer was to pay my uni fees, but only once I'd graduated (and only if I got a good enough degree). Which was nice of them, but didn't help me at the time.

I ended up having to take out three jobs during the summer and winter holidays to earn enough to pay for my food &amp; accommodation during term-time. I worked in a pub/restaurant at weekends, plus worked evenings at a factory order-picking, and nights at a different factory forklift truck driving (which I only got because I had forklift experience and a ticket from when I worked at my parents place at 16). I slept between the hours of 8am and 3pm, had to be at my evening job for 5pm.

I was doing a physics degree which had a stupidly busy schedule which ruled out working during term-time.

Parents like private schools not just because of the grades though but also the social aspects, the sports, the etiquette the work ethic, the aspirations that can be developed in the pupils. These are things that the raw grades don't show.

So yes, their conclusion may be sound but that doesn't mean that private school graduates are getting more than they deserve, if they - for example - work harder [statistically], or apply their learning better or have more drive to achieve then that could explain the difference.

I'm more talking about the last few weeks with Corbyn, not the election. The left are very energised by Corbyn (the rise in people from other parties applying to join to vote for him attests to that) but that doesn't translate to the whole country.

I suppose my point is that the left (including this sub) can (and probably will) get carried away with it and convince themselves that their pro-Corbyn echo-chamber resonates throughout the country.

However, I did get my results today so I can tell you what I see from the perspective of a current student with parents born in the 60s and 70s. 

The competition for places is so much higher than it ever was before. I'd say that out of the 180 people in my year at secondary school, about 140 of them went to sixth form for A levels, 20 or so went to college for vocational skills, and the rest dropped out.

Another reason that competition is so high is that it is also financially accessible in a way that didn't exist before. I knew people in pretty dire financial situations who just knew that they were going to uni, and didn't even give other opportunities a look in. Broke student living is seen as preferable to broke entry level job living. 

As for the inflation on a year-by-year basis? My hypothesis is that as the same syllabus is used, students will become more adept at passing the exams. There are more past papers to study from, the teachers are better at teaching the material and exam technique. The result this has is that instead of the Cock Hero – Mr. Edger – Instructions grades being distributed close to normally, there is a negative skew. So more of the results are bunched up at the higher end of the grade boundaries. This leads to inflation in that more people got the same marks on exams.

Finally, to address your point about your friend who went to Oxford; to As and 1B were probably the equivalent of two A*s and an A these days.

null,null,Sir_Bantersaurus,null,null,null,"&gt; What you say about the figures may be true, but it's my view that minorities deserve representation too and this surge in Corbyn's popularity is probably in direct response to years of marginalisation and under-representation during the Thatcherite consensus. Again, it seems odd to me to fault people for pushing for a movement towards greater representation in their own parliament. Why the upset?

I am faulting the logic that the party should appeal less broadly to the public and instead double-down on a small portion of their base. Yes it's 'better representation' but only to a small section of society. What about all the moderate Labour supporters? People who are generally fine with free markets and capitalism but want to protect benefits for those in need?

&gt; Are you saying that because a vaguely defined proportion of the populace disagrees - keen on Blairism/austerity - other people should be contented to remain marginalized? 

No I am saying they should push for aspects of it in a broader party. It's a minority view that won't win wide support from the electorate. However if they throw their support behind a collation of interests (i.e The Labour Party) in return for some of their platform (i.e Rail Nationalisation) then that will actually stand a chance of achieving something. Instead Corbyn represents Labour retreating into the comfort zone of some of it's base with a ideologically pure platform that is tailor made for them but fails to appeal to the rest. 

&gt; Don't get me wrong, I appreciate your argument and the pragmatism behind this ""party of government"" angle most trumpeted by Blair, Campbell, et al. The fact remains that we who are worst affected by austerity don't comprehend the logic in the Conservatives' targeted cuts and chosen victims.

Here is the thing. Blair, by winning an election, did more for those people than Corbyn either have and, with my view he'll lose the election, ever will. Corbyn will retain the moral high-ground that comes from never having to deal with the dirty realities and compromises of power. The minimum wage, increased benefits for those who needed it (and maybe some who didn't), massively more spending on the NHS and Education and writing off third world debt. Hell, Blair may have shifted right but he also caused the Tories to shift left. Cameron had to make loads of noises about the NHS and the Environment to be credible in 2010. Now the Tories can undo that. Why? Because they won. How do we stop it? By winning. 

That's how we stop the Tories. By booting them out of No 10. Are all your ideals so important that it's not worth compromising some of them to get the Tories out and a party that will protect disability benefit in?

&gt; We'd like there to be a legitimate and powerful platform for opposition against a system which appears to be cruelly punishing the completely wrong people.

You do that by posing an electorate threat and then winning an election. An opposition that has little prospect of unseating the Government is toothless. Corbyn can verbally oppose but the Tories will pass the bills. Tory MPs in marginal seats won't feel under threat and are more likely to vote as whips dedicate.

Granted, Doctor Who isn't a show where we generally care about the science. But the things they got wrong are so basic that it's just looney tunes. We're not talking about time paradoxes here. We're talking about basic gravity and mass, things that everyone learns in grade school and high school. 

""Oh, the embryo shifted, so now you're floating."" Facepalm. I face palmed constantly. And then it lays another egg that is its same mass. Oh, and I guess Apollo didn't find minerals, because it has none, because it's an egg. We've only been studying the moon since forever. Then there's single cell bacteria that are spiders the size of dogs, which are obviously not single cell organisms. And the Doctor had no idea this whole time?

a few points-

1) The new rules on car tax will not apply until 2017, and won't be retrospective- if you have a car free of tax now, it will still be free of tax later in its life. It's not a real big point to have a car entirely free of road tax, because all small ones (except sport models) will be at worst very low tax. When I bought one recently I had to choose between a 1.0 (free) or a 1.2 (£20). Insurance will be a much bigger cost.

3) as others have said, the yearly check does not apply until the car is 3 years old anyway. Even then, it is not usually a problem till the car is very old. In most cases the garage will fix any problems that arise at the check before retesting

4) There are a lot of ways of buying a good second-hand car, e.g. 'approved used' from a dealer, or AA/RAC inspected. In most cases you are buying a car from a company, not a person, so you can insure it before you drive it away.

They can give evidence via video and not have to step inside the court and will be supported the entire way by victim support. They won't need to hire a Solicitor, but will instead have victim support with them as the Criminal Prosecution Service (CPS) are the people who will bring the charges against the person who sexually assaulted them because it's a criminal offence and not a civil case.

Firstly they need to make sure that they report this and then they'll have to go through some investigative procedures by medical professionals. This is the beginning of the police gathering evidence against their attacker. When these procedures are done, there wont be anybody in the room who doesn't need to be and they can have someone in there with them to support them through it. These are discreet.

The funny thing is, I see much more criticism for Ramires on /r/chelseafc than I do anywhere else.

His work rate is of much more value than you make out. There's a reason he plays against the big teams. He closes down like no one else. He presses the opposition in their half very effectively. 

Technically he's no where near as bad as some suggest. Even on the wing (where I'll admit he's wasted) he puts good balls into the middle. He's a decent dribbler, mix this with his pace and he's great on the counter attack. His finishing is much better than people give him credit for too. That outside boot finish against Everton last season was very cheeky.  

You don't have to *like* every player on our team, but as a supporter you should at least *want* him to play well. Saying shit like ""Seeing him with the flu at the end of last season was great"" just makes you a crappy person in general.

You might be right but here's how I'm seeing it: say you're currently a smoker and you also smoke weed (the case with a lot of ppl who smoke weed today in the UK seeing as though tobacco is almost always mixed with it). Then one day tobacco becomes illegal. Next time you see your drug dealer, he happens to have decided to sell tobacco now that it's not legally available. Now you've got supply and demand and this will happen enough to create a black market.

Will it be walled gardens only? Will it be based on a footprint? E.g. any garden with at least three walls under 700 sq. ft? 

So, would a terrace area outside a café be affected? How far from the café would you need to be before you could smoke again?

In the end, you have a whole pub to go at, where the government have made it illegal to smoke. Pubs are already struggling, and the reality is, lots of pub-goers smoke. There is a clear demarcation between inside and outside, and often there is no need to go through the garden to access to bar.

They've said that my A level conditions have been met but I will still have to wait on the GCSE result next week before I get accepted. The offer was for an A in the GCSE and although I'm pretty sure I won't get that I have a good feeling they will let me in anyway due to my A levels conditions being accepted. However my main problem is if in the off chance they do reject me due to the GCSE result and since it comes out a week later, will I be a serious disadvantage in terms of clearing and getting a place at a different University? 

I had an offer from University of Manchester for AAB but with a condition for a B in the GCSE subject however I rejected it due to other problems. In my mind I am wondering if my first choice do reject me (University of Kent) there might be a chance for me to get back into the University of Manchester (slim chance I know), however if I wait a week won't this chance be severely less likely or will I still have a decent chance?

Another way to look at it is like this- people usually join a party because they have a list of policies that they support and want to see enacted. Generally speaking, the aim for many politicians is to see as many of these policies enacted as possible. Rather than lacking the same principles, many of the Centrist supporters (myself included) have taken the view that by leaving aside some of the more radical policies, the opposition stands a much greater chance of enacting the remaining ones.

Shouts to a team mate during training, timing seems disrespectful to Pascoe for sure but hardly major crime. Pascoe didn't seem generally bothered with how he acts there twice mentioned in interviews how hard Balotelli was working in training.

Scores an own goal in training. So what, really. Certainly worse incidents have happened there.

Has a late night before a game kicking off in the evening, and no actual time given. Not as if it was a midday match regardless. He wasn't one of the worst players and wasn't subbed off during the game.

Speeding clearly not a good thing, considering he had more than a dozen waiting for him in Italy whilst playing for City, it's not like the club could act surprised either. It's not like he's alone in it, we renewed Kolo's contract after he was fined for speeding twice in a few days. Johnson had a speeding ban in 2014. Rush lived up to his name for it too.

Not knowing the players names, seems a bit tenuous, especially as they have them on their shirts. From what has been said about meals at Melwood before the team seems to split into English and not for those and he doesn't seem to have had any trouble mixing with those not English.

All the stuff about N'Ze, so what.

&gt; Those who witnessed Balotelli’s efforts in training admit that he might as well have joined him.

&gt; Put to him after the game that Balotelli would now be making headlines for good reasons, Pascoe said: ""Of course. That is Mario.

&gt;""He is working hard in training and he got his just rewards coming on and getting the goal.""

&gt; ""It (the goal) is great for Mario. He wants to work all the time.

&gt; ""He is still a young lad, a tremendous talent and that is what he wants to work on - his movement, his finishing.

&gt; ""After every session he wants to do that. For himself, it was great to get that goal.""

And February

&gt; Balotelli took just nine minutes to find the net after replacing Daniel Sturridge in the second half, and Pascoe said the Italian deserved his big moment.

&gt; “Mario works hard in training,” he said. “Recently he's been ill, and he's had some knocks on his foot where he couldn't get his boot on. It's testament to himself that he kept on going and got his rewards tonight with the winning goal.

&gt; “Is he happy? He's immensely happy. You get the winner at Anfield, you're happy!

Can you point to any governing party in the last 300 years that didn't have decreasing majorities in each election, apart from Cameron's?

Decreasing majorities don't matter *as long as you have a majority* and can still legislate your agenda.

The more salient point is that in the hundred years Labour has existed, *all* it's prime ministers have come from the right of the party.

When the left try to take over the voters give the big thumbs down.

If Corbyn and Benn hadn't been such c%%nts in the early 1980's, a moderate Labour party would have been back in power by 1983. But they paved the way for **18 years of Tory government**

In wedge politics you create a divisive issue that 'divides' the opposition into two camps. In this case the issues is austerity.

It's the reason Cameron invited the Greens into the debates. They wanted to create an internal rift amongst Labour voters.

&gt;The easiest way to win marginal electorates in Australia is to appeal to people who will react to single issues, which are often divisive and do not reflect values held more widely by society. If people are forced to vote but don't have any particular interest in bigger political questions, then attract them by **giving them simple messages that appeal to their most basic instincts, usually fear.** Immigration is a touchstone issue in this strategy. **Personal attacks on opponents is another key element.**

Sound familiar? Well that's an article from 2012 talking about Crosby in Australian politics

Expand your mindset further than ""Isn't it nice to have a few lettuce growing in my garden"", to how much food you would actually need to grow to sustain yourself. 

Sorry, no I don't sign up to only eating food that can be grown in the UK. The system we have now is much better. 

Have you ever considered moving to a commune, or becoming Amish?

To mass produce self sustaining houses, will require lots of money. Easier to do in a growing economy. 

Its hurting me because even a small amount of rational thought shows how stupid these ideas are.

null,null,Mardarkin,eng-norfolk,Norwich,null,"&gt; Yes it's 'better representation' but only to a small section of society. What about all the moderate Labour supporters? People who are generally fine with free markets and capitalism but want to protect benefits for those in need?

I agree with you in principle - the moderates need a voice too. Luckily, they had and have the opportunity to vote. If they decide not to, it hardly seems fair to blame the side that was more eager and motivated to get involved.

&gt; No I am saying they should push for aspects of it in a broader party. It's a minority view that won't win wide support from the electorate. However if they throw their support behind a collation of interests (i.e The Labour Party) in return for some of their platform (i.e Rail Nationalisation) then that will actually stand a chance of achieving something. Instead Corbyn represents Labour retreating into the comfort zone of some of it's base with a ideologically pure platform that is tailor made for them but fails to appeal to the rest.

It seems to me that it is exactly the Labour party's broadness that has caused this whole painful protracted split in the ranks. New Labour broadened its church rightwards without ever ejecting any on its left wing. Now I think you're seeing members pushing for a few allowances for their beliefs and you're criticising them for doing exactly what you propose: pushing for a few ideas to be represented by that broad party by showing and voting where their allegiances lay. It's up to the Labour party as a whole to either accept or dismiss their views. As for your latter predictions here, I'll say what I've said before. You *may* be right, but without my crystal ball I'm hesitant to completely deny the possibility that Corbyn understands some aspects of negotiation and compromise and the task of bringing the party together inherent in leadership. It might be a purist ideological leftwing agenda that he ends up putting forth but I personally doubt it, though I don't doubt it will be portrayed as such in the media.

&gt; That's how we stop the Tories. By booting them out of No 10. Are all your ideals so important that it's not worth compromising some of them to get the Tories out and a party that will protect disability benefit in?

As I've said I have some admiration for the practicalities of your argument and the whole ""Third Way"" project. There's no doubt that being in power allowed for a massive transformation of our state and, in many cases, for the better. At the same time, New Labour was frighteningly comfortable wielding authoritarian legislation, entrenching the power gap between rich and poor, dealing arms, war and death around the world. 

I think it's a mistake to assume, like you keep insisting, all Corbynites are incapable of compromise. I couldn't be much more enthusiastic about Corbyn, but I can see the sense in a maximum cap on benefits received and the practicality of a system that, for a start, can accurately measure and record the amount of migration into the country. That's two small examples. But liberty, equality, peace - these are ideals I'm not eager to compromise on. If I have to pretend not to favour these things or steps towards their accomplishment in order to achieve them, how am I trustworthy thereafter, and how was it worth it? I believe you have to take the moral high-ground sometimes and work on the (admittedly very difficult) task of bringing people around to your thinking with argument.

&gt;You do that by posing an electorate threat and then winning an election.

I believe that the mass mobilisation to vote for Corbyn indicates that people in this country are prepared to vote for something that isn't, as yet, being offered. I also think it's possible that a Corbyn Labour might be more likely to oppose, not vote with, the Conservatives' measures. This could potentially solidify a large bloc in Parliament completely opposed to the Conservatives which has a certain appeal, where other candidates could end up giving the Tories an unofficially larger majority by pandering to the Daily Mail narrative, a far more toothless act in my view.

I sense we won't agree on this, but I'd like to thank you for the non-hostile discussion all the same.",null,0,null,1439469061,null,null,false,0,cu1hyn1,null,t3_3gqxtq,null,null,null,t1_cu1h4as,null,null,null,1440453853,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

First of all, the Computer Systems Engineering is a BEng rather than a BSc like Comp Sci, which means you'll be focusing more on circuits and all that electrical engineering stuff. [Looking at the modules list](http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/Documents/college-eps/eece/modules/computer-systems.pdf) you'll do a module that covers C and algorithms first year, however you won't touch object-oriented design and data structures until 2nd year, which is a fundamental concept covered in 1st year CS modules. You won't cover things such as web technologies or databases, however you can choose some optional modules related to multimedia processing in 1st &amp; 2nd year, as well as more CS-like modules in final year such as Compilers and Languages, Human Computer Interaction, Natural Language Processing and Applications.

I think it'd be worth accepting if you love the idea of working with hardware as much as software. However, if you're purely interested in software and see your career going in the direction of building websites or enterprise-level applications, then I'd recommend trying to get on a CS course.

New Labour worked in the 90s because left wingers felt they needed to vote Labour but its Thatcher-lite policies appealed to right wingers and the centre. So they cannibalised the Tory support while retaining their base, brilliant politics.

Now however Left wingers are voting Green or even UKIP already because we feel the Labour party is not our party and does not represent us. Instead of trying to recapture this lost ground the right side of the Labour party is openly and scathingly at war with any leftist or leftist thought. If Corbyn was running for election as Tory party leader he probably wouldn't have got quite this level of vitriol.

What this means is that no leftist with a lick of sense can support the Labour party if the Blairites win, they've set out their stall in the most clumsy and offensive way possible.

It probably wasn't even needed. Look back to how Natalie Bennett got destroyed by Neill and others earlier this year. All you have to do is argue that the policies are flawed and depend on magical fairy money and Corbyn may have floundered as badly as Bennett did - or at least failed to convince a lot of people.

Yes there was tax credit stuff, freezes for 4 years to child tax credits and the ""ground work"" with wording changes to impose the re-jigged bands and amounts, which as you say, will come later.

What I think will happen is that the min wage rise will be put in with the bits that actually change the bands/thresholds/payment amounts.

The steps are:

•Step 1 – report the repairs to your landlord. It's best to do this in writing and give your landlord a reasonable time to do the work. Keep a copy of your letter or email.

•Step 2 – if nothing happens, write to your landlord again telling them that you will do the repairs yourself unless they arrange for the work to be done. Keep a copy of your letter or email.

•Step 3 – allow a further reasonable period of time for your landlord to do the work. If nothing happens after this time, get three quotes for the cost of the work from properly qualified contractors. 

•Step 4 – write to your landlord again enclosing copies of the quotes and giving them a final chance to do the work, for example, within two weeks. The letter should warn that, otherwise, you'll do the work yourself and deduct the cost from the rent. Keep a copy of your letter.

•Step 5 – if there's no response, arrange for the contractor who gave the lowest quote to do the work.

•Step 6 – pay for the work and send a copy of the receipt to your landlord and ask for the money to be paid back to you. Keep a copy of your letter.

•Step 7 – if the landlord doesn't pay back the money, you can deduct the cost from future rent, but not other charges such as service charges. Send your landlord a breakdown of the amounts to be deducted, when they will start and when they will end. Keep a copy of your letter.

You can all sit around wanking each other off saying ""John Stones 2.0!!!!"" all day but I think most of you forget that he didn't play for us in his first season here. Yes, he did sign when we had Distin and Jagelkia playing well, but he still wasn't good enough for the first team then. I remember him having fantastic composure, but getting caught out on the ball often and playing sloppy passes. He's had two seasons of first team football now. Holgate has played only played 22 senior team appearances for a team that finished mid table in League One. He's no way good enough for the first team yet, even as a back up. We can hope he is, and if he is that's fantastic but we need more players with first team experience. Imagine Holgate and Stones facing Chelsea or Man City?

That still leaves us with two centres backs. One who's never played more than 26 games a season and the other who's gonna be 33 soon. It's not good enough! I can't think of many other teams or fans in the PL who would put up with this type of thing with such a passive ""Oh they'll sort something out"". Look at Newcastle! They all stopped buying season tickets (for a bit) and now they seem to have finally invested some money in the first team. Watching teams like Stoke and Southampton getting quality players in makes me die a little bit inside. Shaqiri and Virgil van Dijk seem like players we should be competing for, but to be honest who would want to join a team who's highlights in the last 20 years have been an FA Cup and finishing 4th once?!

It seems to me that on the last election  the conservatives were filling the news with soundbites they knew everyone wanted to hear. Labour did the same, then when they come into power they slip in all these stealth laws anyway whilst playing lip service to what the people wanted.

Now, this Corbyn guy comes to the fore and none of them can understand why he is so popular. They say that he is too far left and you have to hold the middle ground to win an election. I think that they are completely missing the point as to why he is so popular. It is because he believes in something and has conviction and integrity (as far as i can see anyway)

So anyway I was worried about what to do, at that age I was desperate to go to uni since all my friends were and I wanted to leave my hometown. So I went through clearing to grab any place I could doing the subject I wanted. Settled for a Uni I wasn't keen on and knew nothing about and that was that. 

Honestly, don't do what I did, I ended up leaving that course within 6 months after I'd stopped attending. I didn't make friends on the course, and honestly I think that was because subconsciously I didn't want to be there and was just going through the motions. I made friends outside the course and within a few months I just stopped attending everything and spent all my time drinking and worse. 

I went back to work for a year and a half, reassessed my priorities and tried to figure out what my options were. It gave me life experience regarding work and what I actually wanted. Then I reapplied for university after looking at everything I could do with the grades I had, focussing more on the experience that I wanted from university. 

Looking back on it now it makes me realise that when you're that young you've got a lot of time still, you don't have to rush off and do university just because that's what other people are doing. If you're not certain about something it's better to go away and work for a year before going back into education than to rush into stuff you don't want to do.

Coutinho was pretty good for Espanyol when he was 19 in 2011/2012, that season made us scout him, then 6 months after that season ended he moved to us and was one of the best attacking midfielders in the league as soon as he came here.

Mata was absolutely destroying international age groups (including 12 goals in 13 games for Spain U19) and was starting regularly and doing well for Valencia at the age of 19. 5 goals in 24 appearances for an attacking midfielder is pretty good. Next season at the age of 20 he became one of the best attacking midfielders in La Liga with 11 goals 17 assists in 37 games.

Di Maria I think is one of the few who did actually have his breakout season a year or 2 later than the rest. But I think judging him based upon goals scored is a bit harsh as he has never been a big goalscorer. He was still decent in 07/08 and 08/09 when he was 19/20 though.


Hazard had 7 goals and 11 assists in 38 games for Lile when he was 19.. if you don't think that's fucking amazing then I'm not really sure what to tell you!  Even at the age of 18 he scored 10 goals and had 14 assists in 3.7k minutes. That's incredibly impressive!

Then there's also Walcott, who by Ibe's age (19 years 8 months) had already played in 92 games for Arsenal, scoring 11 goals with 13 assists and was starting regularly for England..

Meanwhile 19 year old Ibe who's turning 20 in just a few months has 1 assist, 0 goals in 888 minutes for us and also created one of the lowest amounts of chances out of every attacking midfielder in the Prem last season. There's absolutely nowhere near as much hype around Ibe as there was around players like Barkley, Hazard, Sterling, Rooney etc.. so I really don't understand the 69m euros shite. I'm sure he'll be a good player, on a similar level to someone like Tadic/Lallana.

All of the players I mentioned above were better than Ibe at 19, for some reason we keep pretending that he's going to be world class though. Probably due to the Sterling situation and wanting a replacement to get behind.

null,null,cypherspaceagain,null,null,null,"You said the public voted Tory. I disagreed. The Tories won a majority, but that's not the same thing. Your statement echoed the narrative promoted by the Tory party and the mainstream media, which I think massively misunderstands the electorate. There was not a massive endorsement of Tory policy, or a mandate given to them for the dismantling of the welfare state.

There was a huge chunk of people who voted for parties other than the conservatives, and so saying that the public voted Tory is disingenous, especially when parties such as the SNP have such wildly different policies. People voted for UKIP because of their anti-immigration stance, not because of their economic competence. They voted against, if anyone, the Lib Dems (-15.6%), so areas that were formerly Lib Dem now had the liberal vote split, which means they went Conservative.

Labour's vote share went up by 1.6%, and Tories by 0.8%. This is despite a huge swathe of Labour voters deciding to vote SNP (and [yes, this is what happened](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-scotland-32635871)).

The Conservatives lost 11 seats (10 to Labour and one to UKIP in Clacton) and gained 35 (27 from the Liberal Democrats and eight from Labour) making a net gain of 24 seats.

Labour lost 48 seats (40 to the SNP and 8 to the Conservatives) and gained 22 (12 from the Liberal Democrats and 10 from the Conservatives) making a net loss of 26 seats.

In other words - the Tories got slightly more votes but many more seats. Labour got a bit more votes but lost seats. SNP got many more votes and loads of seats. UKIP got millions more votes but no seats. Lib Dems lost millions of votes and lost many seats. 

It was not a landslide. It was not a huge swing from Labour to the Conservatives. It was not a giant endorsement of the Tories, or of Labour. It *was* a massive vote of disappointment with the Lib Dems. 

Anyway, why is this important? Because I think you assume the public won't vote for a left-leaning candidate at all. I think they will. There was no anti-Labour vote except in Scotland. There was an anti-Lib Dem vote, which happened because they lost their semblance of integrity when they broke their promises. Corbyn, if anything, is a candidate with integrity. I think he will earn more votes than people suspect - he could win all those votes that formerly went to the Lib Dems.

Was there any kind of discussion about payment for his services before this letter demanding £240?

Check the contract you had for this employment carefully and see if there is any mention of this OG or anything related like that.
Check all your emails with the OG too and if applicable, with the CEO if you discussed it over email.


What the CEO said though may not be relevant, even if he is a friend of the OG. The OG is presumably not an employee of the CEO so whatever he says is not binding on the OG and the CEO is not responsible for whatever the OG does.

If the above answers are ""no"", then I'd be minded for a letter in response like:

""All debt to you is denied.
The work you provided was done on the basis that it was done on 'pro bono', as per the recommendation from [CEO]. At no point during our conversations did you explain that costs were being incurred that I was expected to pay.

If payment was expected then a quote for the work being undertaken should have been provided at the outset, at which point *** I would have obtained quotes elsewhere to compare offers / refused your offer of work*** [probably want to edit this to suit].

[Next bit up to you, you can use it now or later if further demands come or not at all]

In light of the circumstances I am prepared to offer £?? as a full and final settlement.""

Only correspond with the OG from this point onwards by letter, no phone calls as you might need a paper trail.
You also might want to get a quote from some accountants for the work that was undertaken, to see just how reasonable his fees are.

If you do include the settlement offer include the words 'without prejudice save as to costs' in your letter, probably at the top. This means this letter can not be used in court as evidence that you were willing to pay money for the work done.


As an aside, it almost seems like the CEO has a bit of a racket going on with his friend. Employs contractors, says his friend can do accountancy work for free, contractors ends up with a bill and the CEO disappears, probably with a slice of the bill.

There are some high frequency trading algorithms (HFTs) that use the public information on order flow to determine market demand (I.e lots of outstanding buy orders for a stock, buy that stock and then sell it again almost immediately when those orders raise the price).

What these guys did was enter lots of large orders so they were publically visible and then cancelled them at the last min. This causes the price to spike and then fall again when the orders are cancelled. They can profit off this.

All this happens in milliseconds so it doesn't massively effect your everyday ordinary traders. It's a way to take advantage of relatively dumb HFTs.

null,null,Haisheikah,null,null,null,"&gt; That would mean you objected to me changing Lamela's position.  

This is correct, because the knock on effect of changing Lamela's position was you shifting Eriksen to the left, and the knock on effect of that was to remove Chadli (our best winger) from the squad.  

And hence, your 'solution' for the right wing, ended up removing the best winger in our squad. Maybe I should have replaced 'best winger' with 'second most effective outfield player', but I considered the former more precise.

I guess as a Lit student your logic train doesn't usually travel more than a few stops and so reaching that conclusion was tough for you, but that's okay, everything will be okay. I'm a Scientist so I can handle everything from here.

That said it is a great city in a great country. However, the student life *is* different in the Netherlands to the British student life.

In fact this goes straight to the heart of right-wing political/market views.

Markets do not at efficiently unless they have full access to all skill levels. Inequality locks off entire portions of the population who cannot compete and thereby limits the markets effectiveness (For example if the market can select from 1,000,000 potential employees not simply the 500,000 most wealthiest then they are more likely to find those most suited to the job).

Hayek (an economist Thatcher thought highly off) even argued for 100% inheritance tax with the entire proceeds invested in education to level the playing field.

Chadli achieved far far more last season than Eriksen, and against more important opposition.

My route through education has been a little different to others: due to ill health I've never been to secondary school and have had to study through distance learning; I was only well enough to take one GCSE (English, for which I got an A*) and have since taken my A-Levels one at a time due to my disability.

I've already received an A* for English Literature and an A for History, and now I'm taking English Language - I got my AS result today, which was an A, so I'm very happy with how things have been going - and I'll be 24 by the time I hopefully start Uni next September. However, there's only one University I *really* want to go to, because I already know people in the city and it's close enough for my family to drive up in under an hour if I needed them, but that University has a minimum entry requirement of three GCSEs.

I'm concerned that all my hard work will be undone by the fact that I wasn't well enough to do more than one GCSE because of my health (although at least it is the right one, as I want to study English at Uni).

Considering it is well documented that this surge has been largely funded and forced by the unions and other parties.

I don't believe Milliband would have been a great prime minister, but he was a good leader of the opposition and often framed the debate, leading to better policy. Andy Burnham and Yvette Cooper can do the same and have the possibility of winning an election which makes the government have to listen to what they have to say. On a wide range of issues, Jeremy Corbyn will be out of step with the electorate and that same pressure will not be there. That is not to say the Jeremy won't have appeal to large sections of the electorate, but I suspect they will be heavily concentrated in seats held by Labour. 

I worry about what effect a Jeremy Corbyn victory will have on my own party. It could be that at the next election the Conservatives will move to the centre to gain as many votes as they can, in which case I am happy.

I'm not going to pay my £3, not only as I no longer can, but as I'm a member of another political party and it's completely undemocratic to be trying to vote in another party's internal election especailly when the candidacy list was known so long ago which really makes me question the legitimacy of the entire process. However, even though I am not a Labour supporter or member I care a lot about this country and it doesn't help it one bit for the main opposition party to be a joke.

You do not need a ""strong"" opposition who blindly vote against everything the government does but a credible one. In case people haven't being paying attention the Tories already have dropped almost every green policy from the coalition, just today they announced government can override local decisions on fracking bans, taken yet another chunk out of welfare, shot up the chances of young people aiming to be socially mobile through turning maintenance grants to loans, chopping tax credit and excluding under 25s from the new minimum (not living) wage, likened immigrants to little more than insect pests, bumped up inheritance tax and given a tax cut to banks, shafted Scotland even more so in a move that will only hasten the break up of the Union, oh and then there's the EU referendum/negotiations bullshit ongoing along with Gove apparently standing ready to scrap the Human Rights Act with whatever he can come up with using his English degree. Pretty good start in only 3 months! And what are the Labour party doing in this? They're busy fighting a rearguard action to try and salvage any semblance of credibility with the centre ground voter. For every step Labour take further to the left it gives the Tories leave to take a step away from the centre ground as well to the right and I don't know what will be left after a further four and a half of them having essential free rein to do with as they please.

The only upside of it is the Green party may actually have an actual opponent in England as opposed to being allowed to just do literally whatever at the moment and get away with it. Green party, only ever had some control over Brighton City Council, had their only MP say they were doing a shit job and managed to reduce the recycling rate to 25% (one of the lowest in the country). Absolute joke of a party with the exception of Lucas and the sooner they fuck off the better.

Unfortunately there is nothing compelling about austerity, there is nothing exciting to be said about not spending more than you earn. But this country is spending ~£50bn a year on paying the interest on our debt. Just think of all the stuff that could be done if we were actually able to use that for something else. It's not a short term plan, hell, it may not even be one I see coming to fruition in a lifetime but unless the world is going to change away from capitalism then you either beat it and keep your head above water or be shackled to debt like slaves and drown as you're now seeing with Greece. It's sink or swim, simple as.

There are multiple reasons we're not in the state Greece is in now but here's one thing most people probably don't realise. The UK deficit is 6x larger than that of Greece. However the reason we're getting by and they're drowning is the total debt. Their total debt as a % of GDP and the repayments they have to make on it are so much higher than ours they don't have a chance.

And we have to get the deficit down to stop that happening to us, as sooner or later it's going to mean total debt as a percentage of GDP creeps up on you. And then instead of paying £50bn a year in interest repayments it's £75bn, so instead of 7% of our GDP then it's &gt;10% and then you've got to try and find the equivalent of the entire transport budgets worth of savings to make up for that.

It's all fun and games saying we won't accept austerity but then you find yourself spending 20% of your GDP in debt repayments and a youth unemployment rate at nearly 60% and it's not really much of a laughing matter any more.

Yes, Yvette just somehow turned nationalisation into a gender and race issue.  Wat.  I don't even.  I'm sorry.

Of all the criticisms of nationalisation I've heard, some much more reasonable than others (up-front costs, lack of choice/innovation/competition compared to a theoretical free market, etc) I don't think I've ever heard ‘it only affects white middle-class men’.  Because that's really a ludicrous argument that uses the symptoms of genuine race and class biases to somehow emotionally charge something that has sweet, precious little to do with finding proper solutions to those biases.

2. As one of Italys best young strikers he is banking on the fact that there will always be a starting place open for him at a midtable Italian club. If so, he doesn't really need to try as hard to showcase his abilities, so long as he performs in his first season back in the Italian league then he can afford to indulge his missus and miss out on another season of top flight football.",null,0,null,1439475702,null,null,false,0,cu1l56d,null,t3_3gthnz,null,null,null,t1_cu1jzh3,null,null,null,1440455352,null,2,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null

It is well documented that in the months of instability up to an election companies stop hiring (this has happened when both Tories and Labour have been in power).

In addition Milliband was relatively hostile to businesses which did worry some of them.

I am not blaming Labour and the SNP for this fall, however the election instability is definitely involved in this. In addition the UK has just experienced an insane jobs boom compared to other developed country's (this is not a political statement, just a fact) and naturally this would one day peter out.

For example per the ONS (see: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10604117) 'The employment rate now stands at 73.3%, the highest rate of people in work since the ONS began keeping records in 1971.'

At such levels is only natural that unemployment may rise in some quarters.

In some cases it's entryism, maybe. In all cases, no, it's not near as pure and simple. I'll use myself as an example: according to Vote For Policies, I'm represented to the tune of 33.3% each by Labour, Liberal and Green parties, so none speaks for me entirely, and that's to be expected. If you're a card-carrying member of another party - fine, that's entryism.

Where do you draw the line on participation in this?

&gt;You do not need a ""strong"" opposition who blindly vote against everything the government

I haven't seen anybody crying out for this. What is being proposed is a clear and visible counter to this particular *version* of austerity which punishes the poorest and most vulnerable and least culpable first and foremost. I think most people can see the sense in balancing the books (even if they question the narrative that Labour's tax-and-spending was/is the ultimate cause in the crisis, or remind us of the many decades in which the country functioned fine while running a reasonable deficit). The question instead is how you achieve the balancing act and who should bare the brunt.

There is NOTHING to suggest that the players don't like and respect Rodgers. Origi, Gomez, Ings all said during the summer how much they were looking forward to working with Rodgers.

Pascoe and Marsh got shipped because they weren't up to it, with at least one reliable journo saying that players specifically didn't enjoy their training sessions. ""Their"" in this case being Pascoe and Marsh.

As for the usual crap trotted out about Gerrard, Reina, Agger and Johnson; do me a favour. Reina and Johnson weren't good enough to be kept, plus Reina specifically agitated for a move despite being first choice under Rodgers for his first season. Agger was still as injury-prone as ever, and on a large contract, we needed to free up some space on the wage bill. We all know that Gerrard didn't want to accept not being first choice, and his performances last season didn't warrant that.

Hence the creation of pay structures that stop rewarding skill and experience in ""producer"" roles at a certain point.

The problem with this is that this creates an incentive for skilled workers to decamp to management and become useless. I recognise that good management is a skilled task, and has value, but I contributed far more to the bottom line as a programmer than I did as a manager (and far more than any manager could do without skilled programmers like me).

I went for a management role for 2 reasons : i) I wanted more control over what was going on (because I felt with some justification that my management were making stupid decisions) and ii) The extra pay was nice. I realised that   i) I was a bloody useless manager, and the problem is probably not my level of authority but my ability to present complex ideas to people, coupled with the inability of those people to understand complex ideas and ii) the pay was not worth the loss of job satisfaction BUT I'm really averse to giving up the pay because I'm human.

People need to recognise this and create pay and promotion tracks that recognise the investment in skills and experience of workers.

I like 85% of the picks. Elias makes zero sense, and Lucas Lima isn't really going to set the world alight. Choosing Kaka, to me, is a complete waste of time. He's 33 years old and will not be in any of our tournaments going forward. I agree that the team needs experienced players, but he's been saying this about Kaka and others for years. I just don't understand that selection. 

Coutinho being out is a bit stupid but I am not shocked at all. He did not play well at the Copa America. Not all his fault, but our attacking flow was quite off when he was on the pitch. Dunga clearly favors Oscar for that role, which I can't even argue with on the national team. 

Overall, I'm more shocked Firmino is there than Coutinho being out. Firmino played out of position at the Copa America, but if Dunga is expecting him to play as a forward than the national team is in trouble. 

Also, why is Neymar there? If he is suspended for the first 2 or 3 WCQ's, shouldnt the team.. um.. you know.. practice and play without him? Maybe prepare for whats to come?

null,null,penderyn2000,null,null,null,"Your two best options are Cardiff o'r Eryri (the  two options that have been put forward already!)
Cardiff is a fabulous city, with plenty of history at its center (the castle being the obvious choice), and as another member has already pointed out, the brecon beacons are just an hours drive away, with great hiking location.
But three days might be a bit much just in Cardiff.
Personally I would suggest Eryri as your best bet. When traveling along the A55 across north Wales, you could spend a day in Conwy (there's an amazing castle there and a lovely town inside the castle walls, full of history, pubs, old shops and other lovely buildings), where you could spend the night. Then going onward, Caernarfon is just over half an hour drive away, is the most famous town in the area, again, located by the sea, with one of Wales' most famous castles. There are free trips around the town talking about its extensive history and past battles, as well as great little pubs and restaurants. Just six miles away from Caernarfon is the village of Llanberis, which is at the foot of Snowdon. It's an old quarry village which is surrounded by about a dozen different walking routes, as well as a massive lake, the quarry itself, a little castle, two old train stations and plenty of pubs and eating establishments. Caernarfon and Llanberis would drown you in welsh culture as well (especially in the language)

Unfortunately, he seemed to have lost the confidence to be the clinical finisher he was at Valencia.  His first instinct changed from goals to passes.  

I think the Fiorentina game wasn't when he finally lost it, but it was when we finally realized, the killer instinct to be a striker was totally lost.  We don't need a #10 that can't score, and while he can certainly contribute, the loss of his finishing touch made him rather one dimensional.

So I'll try to respond to everything you've mentioned/asked. 

1) sebaceous filaments: I can't say if I can tell the difference. I think I'd always been told I have blackheads both on my nose and around face. I absolutely have cystic acne. I'll give more time to reading about this, as you've kindly supplied so much info. I would say my pores are huge on my nose &amp; badly damaged. From a lifetime of medications (topical etc) and probably lifestyle (squeezing when one shouldn't but didnt know better). 

2) medications: I've been on accutane, it worked (!) for approximately 1year before the acne came back. I've also been on hormone pills, antibiotics, honestly, everything. But nothing has worked. Now because of my poor health overall (my diet is excellent though! Lots of health fruit &amp; veg, plenty of water and mixed grains. Also did see a registered dietician a couple of year back in relation to a problem but she happily hi-fived me saying I was already doing everything she would have recommended. Yay!) I can't go back on the antibiotics. BUT I truly appreciate your super knowledge on this, especially as I didn't know they act as an anti-inflammatory. 

More details on topical meds: I'm using TRETINOIN 0.05% every day on my nose &amp; specific cycstic acne that's coming up. My nose doesn't get red &amp; flakey thankfully (Rudolph is only cute with antlers!) but it's not slowing down or stopping what is either sebaceous filaments or blackheads. But it's very slowly (!) closing some pores. Would adapalene do the same? 

Routine: well, this comes as a shock. My previous derm, who put me on accutane told me to ALWAYS use Aqueous. Growl! 

I use Simple's face wash gel. It lathers, not sure if that's the same as foams. Ingredients not in any order are: Aqua,Cocamidopropyl Betaine,Propylene Glycol,Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose,Sodium Chloride,Panthenol,Disodium EDTA,Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, 
Pantolactone, Tocopheryl Acetate, sodium hydroxide 

AGAIN previous derm &amp; this derm said this wash was good for me skin. Double growl, haha! 

OVERALL HEALTH: not that I don't trust you, seriously how could I not given how helpful you've been already!? But without going into too much detail, I have a number of conditions that are neurological &amp; haematological. They cause inflammation of the CNS (central nervous system), and cause my body to react to what it perceives as an attack and just generally toy with me! I'm quite pragmatic about it, and I'm aware that this could be causing the aging process to speed up. Which is why I need to get my butt in gear to get this sorted! I don't want to be a pimply prune at before I reach midlife! Honestly, if you saw me in a cafe you'd never notice there was something wrong...unless you knew me and were familiar with the bad days. ;)

So, what do you think? Change to oil cleansing method &amp; maybe adaplane? I have this huge fear that with the OCM my cycstic acne is going to go bonkers! And what about moisturiser? 

If you have any other questions or I've missed something let me know. I think you're right though, it's worth slowling down on the harsh stuff if it's doing loads of damage. I'm looking at Vit C for help too.

How do we measure how hard someone works? Why should they be paid more? What if they enjoy working harder? What if someone else is unable to work? What if they work really hard but produce nothing?

Furthermore, Cameron didn't win by landslide. He squeaked in by the skin of his teeth - mainly because English people didn't want the SNP to be in government. 

Secondly, Cameron won because Miliband WAS a shitty Labour leader. He only came out of his shell right before the election. He did really well in the second debate, which was too late.

null,null,avapoet,null,null,null,"The Bodleian Library consists of three buildings, all iconic in their own way:

* the Radcliffe Camera (big dome-shaped thing, appears on about 1 in 3 postcards from Oxford, accessible to readers only),
* the Old Bodleian (really old to moderately-old buildings surrounding a quad, tours are available), and
* the Weston Library (formerly known as the New Bodleian until its recent revamping, large portions are freely open to the public including the exhibition rooms, Blackwell Hall, the cafe, etc.)

They're three separate buildings and they're not connected (well, not overground - there are underground tunnels between some of them which are awesome in their own right!), but they're very close to one another. The Weston Library is on the North side of Broad Street. On the South side of Broad Street is the Clarendon Building (archway-shaped building), on the other side of which is a quad, on the other side of which is the Old Bodleian. Through the Old Bodleian's quad and out the other side is Radcliffe Square, where the Radcliffe Camera is. Walking the route I've just described it's only about 2 minutes walk between all of them (longer if you need to divert around the steps to the nearest accessible ramp).

[Here's a slightly out-of-date map](http://blogs.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/history/files/2013/06/bodleian-central-map-updated-autumn-2012.gif) (it shows the Weston Library as the New Bodleian and still under renovation, and Reader Admissions has now moved).

In summary:

* **Weston Library** - North side of Broad Street, free exhibitions etc. are here, and often other things like lectures (often free) and events.
* **Old Bodleian** - across the road and 90 seconds walk to the South, lots of publicly-accessible bits, tours if you want them.
* **Radcliffe Camera** - another 30 seconds walk South: the square is publicly-accessible, but you can't go into the Camera itself without a readers' card - sorry!

I used to think Nepotism and all that class privilege mantra did not exist until I graduated from University and started looking for work. 
You see I got a 1st class in Economics. But for some reason I found it hard to find a Job [I had zero experience]. 

Anyways I eventually found myself in company x [FTSE 250] doing a temp admin based role. I only took the job because of cash flow problems and good name for CV. One day I see this young man walk in with a very expensive looking suit, and he was being introduced to all the investment managers on the desk. Immediately, they had him attending client meetings and assisting with higher ranked duties e.t.c 

I approached him at the water fountain one day and we spoke. His God mother was the regional director on one of the trading desks [Ha!] This was his second internship at the firm, his first was when he was 19 (he's 23 now). 

Oh did I mention that this firm does not have an official Internship programme? He was only there for 2-weeks though. He graduated with 2:1 in History.

After our conversation, I developed a surly outlook on life in general. Because when I graduated a few months earlier I e-mailed the HR of this company asking if they could take me on as an UNPAID intern, and they said that they do not have an official Internship or Grad programme at the time of asking. 

So here I am - 1st class in Economics and he 2:1 in History but yet he commanded the more 'intriguing role' at the firm whilst I was reduced to a temp admin role.

Whilst it is really useful, don't worry about it for now as what have described is a problem in a couple of ways:

- You can't yet judge from the sound and feel of the engine what gear you need to be in, let alone anticipate it

- You will lock up the back wheel and likely come off if you do let the clutch out as you're downshifting way too hard

Engine breaking on a bike is an advanced technique. Don't concentrate on it out the box. From a safety perspective you are better off with the rear brake.

So... once you have got ALOT more experience on the bike and have started to get a feel for what gear you need to be in without looking at the rev counter, then start shifting down one gear at a time. Start introducing it gently.

He won't get a criminal record for smoking weed in his house. Also you're sounding like a bit of an arsehole for making that false dichotomy.

Be rational, if you've already tried talking to him about then the first  step is to tell the people responsible for the building. Inform your letting agent about the problem beforehand, then they can't possibly accuse you.

It's widely accepted by fans, pundits and journalists that Sakho is a better defender, which means that there's another reason why Lovren got into the team ahead of Sakho. 1) BR prefers ""his own"" signings over ones made by the committee. Maybe, although i've ready Coutinho and Sturridge were committee signings, and they walk into the starting 11, which shows that talent come before his agenda on at least 2 occasions. 2) Sakho missing training due to the birth of his child. Again, very plausible, but Henderson rushed back from his second child being born to play against Blackburn in the cup, although there could be differences due to culture. 3) Lovren is busting his balls in training to earn a place in the team. This is the one I would go for. I have a feeling after reading his interview in the Echo about him being blamed for poor performances and some other things i've read he seems like the character (nobody say anything) to try and improve himself to prove his critics wrong. 

It wouldn't be the first time this has happened at the club. Henderson is another good example of a talented, but not overly brilliant technical player that has had to make up for a partial lack of **natural** ability with pure hard work, grit and determination. There's a reason he was offered to Fulham when we were trying to get Dempsey, and since then he's gone from being an average player to being captain of Liverpool football club and a regular starter for both club and country.

Part of the purpose of an opposition is to hold the government to account, and offer an alternative. Even if they don't get elected, they can push the government to be moderate. 

The current government has performed pretty badly. They came into power promising to balance the books by making rapid cuts, and made one year of cuts. This had a crippling effect on the economy so they stopped doing it, falling back to labour's original plan. Now they are promising a new wave of cuts without explaining why it will be different from last time when they had to abort.

null,null,terrymcginnisbeyond,,Labour Member,null,"Liberalism and Social Democracy aren't the same thing, what's proposed would be more properly called the Progressive-Swing-Voter Party (with less choice).  If we believe Jeremy Corbyn can't win on the proposals he's making then we can be damned sure that anyone working with The Greens or pandering to their base will be equally un-electable.  The Greens in fact have many policies that Jeremy Corbyn shares in his personal manifesto; nationalisation of infrastructure, investment in renewable power, retirement of Trident etc, on the other hand Jeremy Corbyn hasn't needed a member of the House of Lords to rescue him during interviews, for all his faults.

Joining all these parties together to form some kind of rosie eyed vision of the US Democrats (a party which Stephen Moss might want to take a closer look at), could also be bad for democracy as a whole, the US has suffered from two party politics for decades, no smaller party even gets a look in, it's either the GOP or Democrat at the polling booth, anything else is simply throwing your vote away, this makes corruption worse, personality politics rule the campaigns and drives the two parties essentially to the same agenda anyway.  We don't have a perfect democracy in Britain, not by a mile, but in comparison to the US it's Utopian.  

What would the in-fighting look like in a party which has members that both advocates against the policies of 'Us' and 'Them', which former Lib-Dem leader Nick Clegg warned against and a party which is all about identity politics The Greens?  How will the ideas of individualism vs collectivism gel together?  

This all sounds like a hair brained scheme of smaller parties by throwing out the baby with the bath water and bringing 'loser' parties together to run on a platform we've all been shown considering the (largely media and right-wing) backlash against both Socialists and the Lib-Dems can not win.  The only party that could possibly gain from this is probably The Greens and The Conservatives.  I would personally suggest sticking by Labour, supporting the democratically elected leader and allowing them a chance before jumping over-board for the life rafts, if you don't like Jeremy Corbyns politics, that's fine, I totally sympathise, but really surely the backing of Labour makes it less likely he'll be able to implement them all, a new 'progressive' party would likely split the vote, have nearly all the same policies as Corbyn and would be equally mocked and vilified in the press, this would probably collapse the Labour Party and this new party, and lead to some Conservative government with UKIP in opposition, each trying to outpace each-other on who can recreate Dickens London all over the newly isolated England the fastest, if that's what Labour members want, well it's their funeral.

Our society is obviously exacerbating that problem somehow. Even if the benefit system is the root cause in supporting (or even encouraging) obesity I'm not sure removing the safety net for them is the best option.

&gt;genuinely disabled

That's a really difficult thing to characterise. In fact weeding out people with a genuine physical or mental hindrance to finding a job is an expensive and time consuming task. It will also never be a perfect system. False negatives will always be a problem, meaning pursuing this course of action will leave some ""genuinely disabled"" without help.

Pushing the onus onto the individual washes the government's hands of any responsibility of how our system might encourage these things. It also means they are justified in not giving out any support.

It is obviously very difficult being overweight enough for it to make you disabled. It isn't a desirable state of body or mind to be in. The only way to help people who refuse individual help is to fix the societal catalysts for the problem.

In this case a huge factor in obesity seems to be poverty. Not sure how reducing the amount of money they have is going to help that.

I'd love to reassess our country's attitude towards food. [This page](http://frac.org/initiatives/hunger-and-obesity/what-factors-contribute-to-overweight-and-obesity/) lists some studies that look into the causes of obesity in the USA. Some of which I think we could do with looking at here.

* Increased consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (Duffey &amp; Popkin, 2007; Nielsen et al., 2002)
* Increased snacking (Duffey &amp; Popkin, 2011; Jahns et al., 2001; Zizza et al., 2001)
* Larger portion sizes (Piernas &amp; Popkin, 2011; Young &amp; Nestle, 2002; Young &amp; Nestle, 2003)
* Higher calorie-density of foods (Kant &amp; Graubard, 2006)
* More meals consumed or purchased away from home (Kant &amp; Graubard, 2004)
* More exposure to advertising that encourages food consumption and promotes unhealthy foods (French et al., 2001; Powell et al., 2011)
* Value-sizing of less nutritious foods (e.g., value meals at fast food outlets) (French et al., 2001; French, 2005)

Attacking these might be a better use of our time. 

I'm just trying to explain my own (pretty left wing) reasoning for why I'm not in favour of benefit caps on the obese. As you explained why you are for it.

So what could Murdoch have hoped to gain? Certainly not damage control: that had been and gone and was in the past. If anything, having The Sun issue another apology, *and* tear into those responsible would have been a gain for him, in terms of restoring the reputation. [As they did](http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4535743/23-years-after-Hillsborough-the-real-truth.html), much, much later.

So: having already taken a massive reputational hit, and lost a big market in Liverpool, what motive did Murdoch have for preventing an enquiry? Certainly not financial. So the question remains: why would he use political capital to avoid an enquiry? The only people who benefitted from that were those whose actions would have been exposed: the police and senior politicians at the time, who instigated the cover-up.

If I had to take a guess, I'd say he was doing a favour for one of those people, in return for something else. I wonder if any senior politicians were involved in making decisions about his business at that time? 

Let's see.. the article says it was quashed in 1998. The [same year that calls began for a monopoly investigation into Murdoch](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/murdoch-monopoly-inquiry-demanded-1149200.html). Also the year that BSkyB Digital launched.

Probably LSE but I only know one or two people who applied there and can't remember if they had interviews or not. Bristol, Manchester, Bath and UCL all did informal interviews but they were all more about you getting to know the uni moreso than the uni getting to know you.

Very few unis use interviews as a differentiating technique. They cut candidates based on these criterion (roughly in order): predicted a-levels, AS results, personal statement, [UMS at AS], [interviews], extracurriculars, very occasionally GCSE results, and then it's just the ones that don't meet the offers.

By the time they cut out the people who have bad predicted grades and low AS results (that aren't adequately explained - a lot of unis will give you a chance to explain away bad grades at AS if you still have high A2 predictions), it's probably around a third to half of the total applicants remaining. Then they'll skim through personal statements and cut out people who look like they just haven't bothered or don't seem excited about the subject, and by then they are normally down to the right number of people. If not, they're probably a uni that holds interviews and can cut out a few (or a lot) of people that way, depends on the uni.",null,0,null,1439480480,null,null,false,0,cu1o2lz,null,t3_3gtqtr,null,null,null,t1_cu1godk,null,null,null,1440456798,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

He needs to be on the same wave length as Kane, Eriksen and those around him. What's frustrating is he had that connection with Soldado. When the two of them played together they both elevated their game massively, but Bobby's troubles in front of goal tended to overshadow this neat interplay they had.

We can see how Kane and Eriksen are getting there with their understanding of each other, they know when to make runs off the ball and each of them know to look for the other in passages of play. When Lamela comes on the pitch it feels like he's on his own team; every ball he plays, every run he makes never quite matches up with what the other players are trying to do. It's a real shame as quite often he's making the most intelligent decision, and it's Dembele or Chadli or Mason that hasn't kept up.

Annoyingly having only come back to training two weeks ago he's not had pre season with the squad to improve this, so now it's a case of wait and see. If he can keep his place and get a consistent run of games this year, along with improving his English and bonding with the squad outside of matches, hopefully we'll see him a little more connected to the rest of the team.

That makes sense now. I hadn't realised Solihull was a borough; I thought they might have just said Solihull because it is close.

In terms of the commute I wouldn't want any more than 30 minutes if at all possible. Definitely no more than 45 minutes but I'd be hesitant at that. To be honest though the level of traffic is more important to me. I had a job last year that took 45 minutes to get home from due to traffic instead of the 20 minutes it would normally take and it was very miserable.

As for accommodation and budget, a one bed flat would be ideal, but I was thinking a room in a house from somewhere like spareroom.co.uk would be more realistic. If I was looking at a one bed flat I could probably go up to around £550. If it was a spare room, I was looking maybe £400ish with bills included.

As for the area, ideally a local shop, like a garage or mini supermarket, with possibly a take away within about 15 minutes walk, with a larger supermarket and possibly a few other shops like clothes shops etc, kind of like a small town centre, within a 15-20 minute drive. A local pub would be nice but if there's a couple in the town centre type thing I'd be happy with that too.

null,null,ppphhh,null,null,null,"There are two 'base' licences, the CBT which you would have to retake every two years, and the A1 which you'd never have to retake but would restrict you to 11kw. That's enough for your scooter, plus you'd be allowed on motorways, to carry passengers, and you wouldn't need L plates. You would need to do the CBT before you did the A1. Strictly the CBT is not a licence in the same sense but it's an argument in semantics.

It would cost you about £100 to do the CBT, £25 for your theory portion of the A1, and just over £100 for both portions (off road manoeuvres and on-road practical) of the A1 test. Say £250 total. This does not include any training or bike rental. https://www.gov.uk/driving-test-cost


The CBT requires no prior training and should supply a bike. The theory test requires no training (you can practice online for free.) The A1 tests will require a bike, you may need to hire one if your bike doesn't fit the requirements, and you will *probably* require training to pass. This obviously varies massively but you should probably budget another £250 at least.

It's ultimately going to save you money to get a full license, assuming you actually ride the 30mph scooter for like ten years. Most people ride around on a CBT for close to two years and *then* do the test, because they've had that time to practice. That's what I recommend you do rather than rushing into a test, since you're not after a bigger bike anyway. It will give you a while to think about your decision at least.

For what it's worth the higher levels of licence allow you to ride *roughly* a 300cc bike at A2 then any size at full A. The DAS takes you straight to A without the faff at smaller sizes. Each level has different age/experience requirements and is rather complicated. **All you ever need for a small moped is a CBT or an A1.**",null,0,null,1439482254,null,null,false,0,cu1p8hi,null,t3_3gu0xu,null,null,null,t1_cu1lia0,null,null,null,1440457346,null,3,null,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3,null

I'm skeptical of this assertion, because I personally know at least 5 people who are unaffiliated to any union or party but who have considered, or even followed through, with joining the party to vote for Corbyn. These people are not loony far lefties, but they are people who have felt disillusioned by politics because they feel there has been nobody to present a traditionalist left-wing platform in politics for a long time. They are people who, twenty years ago, would have joined the Labour party by the time they were eligible to vote, but were driven away by the New Labour obsession.

As for the idea that it's funded by other parties, I disagree. Yes, there are members of, for example, the Green party joining. I'm a GP member and have stood in council elections as a paper candidate. However, I don't make any illusions that Old Labour are my natural bedfellow; my granddad was a pit foreman and a union activist and those values were what I was raised with and which still influence my worldview. I've considered joining to vote Corbyn, but I've decided to wait and see what happens with the election and see what happens with Corbyn leading the party for a while before jumping ship. I know a lot of the GP members joining are in a similar position to myself, feeling as though they're finally able to leave a party of convenience or protest for one of the heart.",null,0,null,1439482644,null,null,1439482937,0,cu1phrk,null,t3_3gtxce,null,null,null,t1_cu1krjq,null,null,null,1440457467,null,7,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7,null

Having said that, to get into Cambridge you will need A grades at AS level (unless you can provide some reason for lower grades, which you are automatically given space to do in your application). From the college's perspective, the most important thing an applicant can provide is evidence of academic ability. Usually this is high AS level grades, but it could also be high GCSE grades. To give yourself the best chance for Cambridge, to aim for A and A* grades, improving your AS grades is key. I don't explicitly know the university's position on repeating whole years - try and find some information online or from an admissions officer at the university.

The next step is to do some maths, and figure out what grades you would have to achieve in all the remaining A level exams/coursework given your current grades.

Out of all Corbyn supporters, 13.7% of them responded that they would leave the party if their ""least favourite candidate wins"".

&gt;2) Nothing really, people have just adapted to our way of playing and we haven't had the answers.

Well, Distin and Howard both had career seasons that year. In addition, Distin was in the lineup which has a positive impact on Bainesy.


 Distin always drift wide which means Baines was already in a more advanced position when he receives the ball. Distin's primary outlet was also Baines which means Baines had a lot of touches. 


I don't need to stress how important Baines' creativity is to our team, but just in case you didn't know, he led the Europe in chances created. Jags, while great playing as a left sided CB, naturally drifts inside as a right footer. Jags also loves to do cross field diagonal long passes, which means Bainesy gets less touches and less involved in the build up of the play.

Also Tofu isn't bad for your health at all. From what I've read soy is a good food source (especially for protein). Here's a few studies:

[Soy: A Complete Source of Protein:
](http://www.aafp.org/afp/2009/0101/p43.html)
&gt;Soybeans contain all of the essential amino acids necessary for human nutrition and have been grown and harvested for thousands of years...Overall, soy is well tolerated, and because it is a complete source of protein shown to lower cholesterol, it is recommended as a dietary substitution for higher-fat animal products. 

[Resistance training with soy vs whey protein supplements in hyperlipidemic males](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2660282/)

&gt; Soy based protein supplements appear to be as effective as animal-based protein to support strength gains. Our results also suggest that soy protein supplementation during resistance training warrants further study in larger samples over longer periods of time since previous work has shown that regular soy consumption improves lipid profiles and the insulin-to-glucagon ratio and lowers oxidative stress.


Also, the estrogen thing isn't true. Studies below:

[Soybean isoflavone exposure does not have feminizing effects on men: a critical examination of the clinical evidence](http://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282%2810%2900368-7/abstract)

&gt;In contrast to the results of some rodent studies, findings from a recently published metaanalysis and subsequently published studies show that neither isoflavone supplements nor isoflavone-rich soy affect total or free testosterone (T) levels. Similarly, there is essentially no evidence from the nine identified clinical studies that isoflavone exposure affects circulating estrogen levels in men. Clinical evidence also indicates that isoflavones have no effect on sperm or semen parameters, although only three intervention studies were identified and none were longer than 3 months in duration. Finally, findings from animal studies suggesting that isoflavones increase the risk of erectile dysfunction are not applicable to men, because of differences in isoflavone metabolism between rodents and humans and the excessively high amount of isoflavones to which the animals were exposed.

[Effect of a phytoestrogen food supplement on reproductive health in normal males:](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11352776)

&gt;This is the first study to examine the effects of a phytoestrogen supplement on reproductive health in males. We conclude that the phytoestrogen dose consumed had no effect on semen quality.

[Effect of protein source and resistance training on body composition and sex hormones](http://www.jissn.com/content/4/1/4)

&gt;In conclusion, it appears that both soy and whey supplementation in free living resistance training men results in lean body mass accretion without negatively affecting serum androgen levels.

I tell this to all of the new foreign fans of the Premier League, just enjoy the football and see where your heart takes you. I think it is the best advice anyone can give you. Perhaps the other foreign fans who chose to support Everton recently can provide more background as to how they made that decision but I can give you a very short history of our great club.

First off, the Premier League has only existed since the 92-93 season. Before that it was simply called the First Division of The Football League. Before the emergence of the Premier League, Everton had more first division titles than Manchester United. We are a very historic club and I would say history means more to an Evertonian than to most clubs currently in the Premier League. We aren't a wealthy club and we don't buy the big names. Our last major trophy was the 1995 FA cup. Young Evertonians have never seen a league title celebrated. If you want to support a club that is going to win a lot of trophies we probably aren't your best bet. If you are the type of person though that enjoys tradition and history then this club is quite special. I would say the best quality our club has currently is our ground Goodison Park. It is one of the few historic football grounds that still remains in the Premier League. If you want to know more about the club there are plenty of YouTube videos (My grandson showed me them).

Wherever I look I see Jeremy Corbyn described as genuine and that will resonate with the electorate. Additionally rather than just the degree to which we accept economic liberalism Jeremy Corbyn will offer an alternative choice. In day to day discussions, I meet a larger proportion people who reject, or are suspicious of, economic liberalism than you are likely to find in parliament.

Corbyn has a difficult path to take a centrist party, still smarting from an unexpectedly large election defeat, along with him as he pursues, what is by modern standards, a radical left-wing agenda. I am not sure how he can accommodate many of the more experienced former cabinet and shadow cabinet members into his own cabinet. If he cannot include them does the parliamentary party have enough strength in depth to find adequate replacements? Will those not included be relied upon to stay on message? Ed Milliband appeared to struggle to keep the backing of the party in the run-up to the election, are Labour members with far less in common with Corbyn likely to sit on their hands again?

The press has been very restrained in their treatment of Jeremy Corbyn so far. Ed Milliband was fairly moderate and they still managed to whip themselves up into a frenzy. Jeremy Corbyn has been on record saying things that go against mainstream opinion on a wide range of topics, he also appears honourable enough to stand by what he has said. For this, he will be punished. A large part of Jeremy Corbyn's charm is that he is a man of the people, it may be all to easy to paint him as a - sometimes dangerous - contrarian who few can relate to on a range of issues.

I do not doubt that Jeremy Corbyn has appeal. I believe he can create new Labour voters. In doing so, he will lose many of the moderates along the way. I am not sure if he can increase their vote share in many swing seats. I expect in most he will lose more votes than he gains.

To be a strong opposition Labour need to have the threat of winning the next election. Offering a choice is only a threat if the electorate is likely to take it. I don't believe the country is with him yet. For him to be a realistic threat he has to convince many people, including former conservatives, to take the country in a very different, and to many, risky direction. Had the conservatives been in power in 2008 and Corbyn led Labour at 2010 perhaps people would have taken that risk, I doubt they would today nor in five years.

Yes.

No. And Santander didn't ask me this when I overpaid a lump sum a few months ago. They just asked me whether I wanted to use it to reduce the monthly payments or reduce the capital. 

**Ring them up and tell them you want to make a capital payment**, not overpay. It could be that the drone you had on the other end didn't fully understand what you meant as ""overpaying"" only gives you reducing monthly mortgage payments or the term if you maintain the same monthly payments.

If you really don't know why this is then you're missing some very valuable knowledge about how gears work in a general sense. There's nothing wrong with that but it's worth knowing. You'll pick it up with experience anyway but as a general guide, more rpms = more speed, I'm sure you know this. At constant rpms, different gears will give you different speeds. 8k rpm in second for instance might be 20mph, but in third might be 30mph. To stay at 20, when you change up to third you need to *decrease* the revs, maybe to 6k.

When you're changing down two gears at once you're not actually slowing down too much (during the change), so suddenly your wheels going along drives the engine speed up. That 2k revs you were doing in fourth gear is 'worth' 8k revs in second gear at the same speed, and once the clutch is out those revs are going to come on regardless of where the throttle is. Does that make sense? Of course if your throttle is 'off' then the engine resists these revs and you slow down, which is how engine braking works.

What you should be aiming for is to adjust the throttle when you change gear. So you roll off, change gear, and roll back on to a new position which gives you the right revs for your speed in your new gear. There's no way to teach you this online but you will get it with practice. It's called rev matching and is a relatively advanced technique so don't worry about it for now. For now if I were you I'd rely on the brakes more to slow down, and only change gear one at a time. There's nothing wrong with changing a couple at once but as you've discovered, it can alter the bike's behaviour quicker and that's not something you want while you're inexperienced.

Paulinho struggled similarly for two years. He was equally as bad as Soldado, kept his head down and never caused trouble, tweeted about the team/positive results etc and yet he was everyone's favourite punch-line for being shit. Especially when he left, now that Soldado is finally leaving we're expected to treat him like a war hero?

Soldado's work ethic also isn't clearly so high, he shrinks out of games as badly as anyone else, I'm not going to give him a pass on that because I feel bad for him. The whole Soldado runs a lot and Ade doesn't is a myth. Plus if you want to slate Adebayor for not working hard enough, why not have a go at half of WHL that boos him whenever he comes on, how is that supposed to motivate him to run around?

Notice that your bleeding heart doesn't extend to Adebayor and how willing you are to chuck him under the bus despite him being absolutely incredible for us for periods of his career. Not to mention when you factor in all of the personal issues he's faced, how come he isn't deserving of our eternal coddling the way Soldado is? This isn't me bigging up Adebayor either I want him gone as well, it just does my head in how we treat one and not the other. I've actually seen Adebayor take control of MANY games for us, score loads of goals and win us many games, same can't be said for Bobby, simple as.

* Ben Bradshaw started to privatise parts of the NHS management when he was Minister of State in the Department of Health. 

* Stella Creasy is young but seems genuine. I'm having trouble placing her, because she hasn't really had time to make any mistakes. Her big thing is fighting against payday loans.

Seriously, the Soldado circle-jerk is so embarrassing ffs Paulinho was a ~good professional~ but he was the butt of everyone's jokes. I'm not going to coddle a professional footballer for producing NOTHING in exchange for a weekly paycheque akin to what my entire family makes in a year, and your suggestion that I don't support the team because I refuse to is just stupid.

Every time he pulled the shirt on I gave him a chance, in exchange I was given nothing but dissapointment and misery. Now, if the deal were to fall through and he continued to pull the shirt on, I would continue to support. That DOESN'T mean I can't be relieved to see a crap player go.

null,null,Badgerfest,cnty-england,England,null,"I'd be really interested in your sources for this as this has been a major area of interest of mine for some time the first time that I have seen someone seriously suggest that the original aim of overthrowing the Taliban was anything other than to aid the destruction of Al Qaeda.

Bin Laden may have not have been invited to Afghanistan in 1996, but he quickly found an ideological ally in fellow salafist Mullah Omar and, with Bin Laden's resources seriously depleted after a forced expulsion from Sudan, the relationship was mutually beneficial.  Bin Laden gained a base to regroup, Mullah Omar gained a wealthy, influential ally who could help limit the influence of the Northern Alliance.  The relationship only began to sour around 1998 when attacks on the US Embassies in Tanzania and Kenya brought increased American scrutiny on Al Qaeda and, by extent, the Taliban.  The bombing of the USS Cole in 2000 is believed to have seriously strained the relationship as Bin Laden focussed on international attacks, whilst the Taliban needed to secure their power at home.

The final nail in the coffin of the relationship appears to have been Bin Laden's aim to draw America into a costly war in Afghanistan in the hope of reliving his glory days during the Russian occupation and bleeding America dry.  It is important to note that many Mujahadeen consider Russia's withdrawal from Afghanistan to have led directly to the breakdown of the USSR – Bin Laden believed this could happen to America as well.  The Taliban wanted no part in this as it would directly threaten their rule of the country.  Al Qaeda's final act before launching 9/11 was to assassinate Ahmed Shah Massoud, the Northern Alliance's senior military commander and a Talisman for the Tajik minority, in order to hinder the Alliance's ability to fight in support of the US.  As for the Taliban offering to capture Bin Laden, there may have been some political will to do so, but the mainly Pashtun Taliban are bound by Pashtunwali, the hospitality code of which makes you personally responsible for the well-being of a guest, even if they are your worst enemy.  Breaking this code would have grave consequences for their reputation and that of their tribe.

Probably the clearest indicator that the aim of the NATO response was not to occupy Afghanistan is that operations started on 7 October 2001, less than a month after the attacks, and took the form of air strikes and small groups of special forces to assist the Northern Alliance – hardly an invasion force.  For his part Bin Laden stayed in Afghanistan until December 2001, after the fall of Kabul, and only opted to retreat through Tora Bora in the face of increased threat to his life.  This is why we didn't need to focus on the border areas immediately.  The escape was also a close run thing: Sandy Gall estimates that US special forces may only have been a matter of hours away from catching up with Bin Laden and could here his voice in ICOM chatter, but were hindered by unreliable Afghan forces.  

I would also caution comparing the worst excesses of the Northern Alliance with the Taliban.  Massoud was renowned for punishing commanders who brutalised civilians and whilst the likes of Rashid Dostum committed atrocities against Taliban soldiers, there would be no Northern Alliance attempts to deliberately attack civilians.  In a country so ingrained with tribal politics and political violence it is nearly impossible to find a “clean” politician – but that is what we tried to do with Karzai and look how that turned out!

Ribery, first time he broke 10 goals and got as many as 5 assists was for Bayern in 2007-2008; and he never got 10 goals or 5 or more assists at any point before that. Willian is another example. Closer to home, Steve McManaman--didn't click until 97 for him really, but then it all really came together and he became a more consistent player. Gareth Bale: it took until 2010 for he and Spurs to work out he was not a fullback and then it all came together.

The potential is there. If he has the it-all-clicks season that similar wide players have had, his potential is really high.

The starting line up was usually Howard, Coleman, Jagielka, Distin/Stones, Baines/Oviedo, Barry, McCarthy, Barkley, Mirallas, Osman/Deulofeu, Lukaku. 

We played counter attacking football mainly concentrated around winning the ball near the halfway line and countering rapidly with our front 4 and overlapping fullbacks. A key part of our success was our rampant fullbacks, with a lot of goals coming from their crosses or them themselves, often having them both in or around the area. We played a lot of possession football to limit the opposition's opportunities but the majority of our goals came from speed and directness. The reason this didn't work last year is because people learnt how to stop it by stopping our fullbacks, and we lost the huge asset of Deulofeu's pace. When Lennon came back into the line up we saw some of that return.

     ---------------Drogba----------------

Ivanovic has proven himself as our maybe best right back of all time. Now he seems older, and a bit more tired. But from 10/11 and till 14/15 he was unstoppable. A defender with a strikers sense of goals - amazing player.

The Terry/Carvalho pick was more of a partnership. centrebacks need to work together, and understand eachother - and these two did just that. Amazing partnership, and let in the fewest goals ever in a single season. Brilliant.

Essien/Makelele/Lampard. The most dynamic midfield EVER. No need to explain further.

Hazard is turning into one of the greatest today, and i think he is the greatest winger we have ever had, and i had to find a place to put Zola, so i sat him on right midfield, could play anywhere in attack though, almost a perfect player.

And of course Drogs, no explanation needed.

Honorable mentions: Desailly, Robben, Flo, Di Matteo &amp; Joe Cole

I said nothing of my personal thoughts on Adebayor (or any other player, including Soldado.)

Not his performance, or his personal struggles, or his skill. 

I haven't shown a ""bleeding heart"" to Soldado, and I haven't chucked Adebayor under the bus. I pointed out the perception and image difference in the two and why that has caused some fans to gravitate to Soldado. There's an equally compelling argument for why fans gravitate toward Adebayor (which pivots on his flashes of brilliance, like the 2-2 draw with Chelsea with he and Siggy on the score sheet.) There are also examples of why people would push away from Soldado (evident by your posts) and, again, why people would push away from Adebayor.

One cheeky idea though: Find a shop in the airport online and get the store number. Ring some shops till you get someone and explain the situation. There is a post box in the airport so if there is still a tenner in it, then the shop assistant might be tempted considering all they need to do is wrap it and drop it in the post box.

I even found one number for you. It is a long shot, but if it was me working in the shop i'd prob do it.

Your OP said that Soldado's work ethic was ""so clearly high"", it also said Adebayor's is ""consistently absent"". 

If you can show me some numbers that suggest Soldado covers massive amounts of ground, or puts in massive amounts of tackles then I can begin taking this claim seriously, until then I can not.

Can you also help me in pointing to the conclusions I jump to? Anyone who praises Soldado is up-voted immensely and anyone who expresses anything but sadness at him leaving is down-voted aggresively. This tells me that as a fan-base we, for some reason, value him as a player and are willing to excuse anything and everything.

Now, given that it looks like we agree that suicide is rarely a rational, avoidable choice, would you not agree that there are other conditions that are a result of circumstances, or mental health issues, which are also unavoidable? 

Including obesity. 

Now, where the benefits issue comes into this is not whether refusing help is a lifestyle choice or not, but how accessible that help is. Things like 'exercise on prescription' are *not* free. 

I got gym membership on prescription on a recommendation from a physio as part of recovery from an injury, but it still costs £37 a month. I can afford that, but I have a decent job. If someone lives in an area where something like that is absolutely all that's on offer, and they just can't afford it, then they're placed in an impossible position. There are loads of other reasons why they might not be able to. What would the childcare costs be like for someone to go to a gym enough for it to make a difference? 

Is someone refusing 'help' because they want to be fat? Or because the help on offer just isn't feasible for them? 

Government programmes aimed at helping people get into work have about a six percent success rate. They've got a much higher success rate at simply shifting people off the books and into the grey or black economy. But basically, they're shit and deliberately difficult to engage with. I can't see that this help with obesity or eating issues will be any better.

You misquoted me by saying ""is so consistently absent,"" which is jumping to a conclusion. The whole point I tried to make twice is that the fan base you're pointing at has a *perception* that Soldado puts forth more effort because, in that same groups' collective mind, Adebayor *seems* so consistently absent.

I'm not making any statements about who's good or who's bad or which fan view is right or wrong. Instead, I'm saying how there are lots of fan views, and the one that you're commenting on is coming from this perspective. Again, I'm not trying to convince you (or me) to like (or dislike) Soldado (or Adebayor) (or parentheses). I'm just discussing that fan perception and why it makes some people celebrate Soldado.

As for the conclusions, sure.

* Calling me a bleeding heart for Soldado
* Assuming I don't like Adebayor
* Assuming I've forgotten how quality Adebayor has been in the past
* Assuming I forgot about Adebayor's family
* Assuming I'm trying to say Soldado performed better than Adebayor (lols)

And in your last response:

* Saying anyone who praises Soldado gets upvotes and anyone who expresses anything but sadness about him leaving is downvoted aggressively

You and I are about even in this little thread. At the time I posted this, you actually had one more upvote (from me, probably.) :D 

Though, I'm just being silly with the last one. You're pretty much right there. People do get loads of upvotes for Bobby-love. 

At any rate, I honestly think your opinion on Soldado is pretty solid. I only wanted to comment on why the group you were commenting on acts/feels the way they do.

null,null,PerfectlyNormal77,tardis,TARDIS,null,"Why doesn't the Doctor go to Gallifrey in the past? I think there are two reasons: personal and technological.

The personal reason is this: To the Doctor, he IS the last one left. The Timelords in the past are just shadows to him. Gallifrey (until the events of ""Day of the Doctor"") is gone. 

The technological reason is this: There's a good chance that there are safeties built into the TARDIS that prevent it from going back in time to Gallifrey. If this were possible, wouldn't the Doctor have just gone back in time to warn the Timelords about the impending Time War? In fact, this could very well have happened, which may have triggered the events of Genesis of the Daleks, which RTD mentioned as being one of the first shots of the Time War. If the Doctor went into his own past, there's also a chance he could start creating paradoxes that he couldn't stop (see ""Father's Day"").

IIRC, there's also a mention in the Classic Series that Gallifrey is synced with all the TARDISes, so they can't go back into Gallifrey's past. 

So how does Listen happen? Well (aside from explaining it as Moffaty-timey-wimey-ness), the Doctor removes all the TARDIS safeties and uses the telepathic circuits as a direct interface with the TARDIS itself. Since it's Clara piloting (the Impossible Girl who is a fundamental part of the Doctor's timeline), and not the Doctor, the TARDIS can do what's necessary (create the fixed point of the scare). If the Doctor tried it, I bet the TARDIS would stop him from doing so.

And I believe that Moffat has hinted in interviews that the Time Lock really doesn't exist anymore (or it doesn't work the way the Doctor thinks it works), which could be very interesting for upcoming series.",null,0,null,1439490137,null,null,false,0,cu1unh0,null,t3_3gutbh,null,null,null,t3_3gutbh,null,null,null,1440459898,null,3,null,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3,null

First off - these aren't the only allegations against Corbyn.  There are now many more questions.  We're talking about a pattern that's being established.

To answer your question.  I think that it is worth the media pursuing just what he meant by 'friends' and I don't think that the excuse that this was being used as part of diplomacy is entirely convincing.  Again - there is a pattern emerging.  This isn't a one off and it's more significant than just a tabloid style 'gotcha' moment because a politician used the wrong word by accident.

&gt;Paul Eisen is not someone Jeremy Corbyn's office has any dealings with.

Well the Holocaust denier Eisen claims in his blog posts that Corbyn donated money to his group and has attended every one of his events.  Who's telling the truth?  I don't know, but I think these allegations are serious enough that Corbyn should be quizzed about them by an experienced interviewer.  Preferably before he becomes the next leader of the Labour party.

&gt;For anyone interested, Left Foot Forward is a blog created by Jack Straws son.

I disagree with you that dribbling has nothing to do with pace. You think Leo Messi would beat multiple markers the way he does if he was a slouch? No, it's his burst of speed combined with his intricate dribbling that allows him beat defenders. He glides past them like they're statues because he's got such quick feet.

Anyway, personally I think Townsend and Lamela are just about as effective as each other.

Corbyn supporters are seriously underestimating the divisions within the party.

I definitely agree that inequality has negative effects and is particularly an issue if the people on the lowest end can't afford to live. However economic growth would stall under socialism with productivity dropping massively. This makes the countries GDP drop; businesses have to fold meaning unemployment sky rockets and tax revenues decrease so the government can't provide public services. 

That said, I'm not saying that elements of socialism aren't good and necessary to protect people.

Title - Clinton Njie (Lyon), five years in Tottenham

Pic sub - Njie already left the OL.

 (L'Equipe)Absent from training Olympique Lyonnais on Thursday morning, the attacker Clinton Njie (21) flew at the same time for London. In the afternoon, the Cameroon international has spent the early part of his medical with Tottenham who found an agreement on Monday with OL for a transfer which the allowance is 14 M € (+ 3M € bonus).

After completing the medical examination, it should commit Friday for five seasons with the Spurs. The London club hoped to formalize its transfer very quickly in order to align to receipt of Stoke City Saturday (16.00). But it is unlikely that Njie gets his work permit by then. His signature in the Premier League will, in any case, allow him to multiply his salary by six (from 30 000 euros gross monthly to 180,000). Negotiations on the revaluation at OL failed in recent weeks.

I find this opinion offensive. Off to jail!

His job is to present a radio show that people choose to listen to, his job is to be himself and entertain. If people don't find it entertaining, if they find it offensive, they can switch it off. Saying no one is allowed to hear it (PSB or otherwise) is not acceptable in a free society. If the BBC don't want people expressing opinions on their stations, why would they have a phone in show at all? Why hire live broadcasters over pre-recording educational shows? As a PSB, it should also be their responsibility to broadcast ALL opinions regardless of how ""offensive"" one group or another finds it, because that represents how a portion of society feel. The comments in all the usual discussions range from agreeing with what he said to what we see in the news story posted. If that's how people feel, that's how they should be allowed to feel. Again, if they find it hurtful - go listen to something else.

&gt;If he said every disabled person should have to walk around with a sign around their neck so everyone else could identify and stay away from them, **would that just be voicing his opinion?** 

Yes. Yes it would. Turn it off if you don't like it.

&gt;If someone wants to have discriminatory opinions you are quite right they are entitled, but they also need to deal with the consequences of having that opinion.

The consequences should be ""I disagree because X"" and ""you are incorrect because Y shows that..."". Dialogue. Discussion. Exploration of ideas and ideologies. Loss of listeners. Online **discussion**.

Not ""you aren't allowed to work any more"".

&gt;If I suggested to my manager at work that I didn't like the look of asians and they should be made to identify themselves so I could stay clear i'm not sure if I'd lose my job or if he'd just label me an arsehole.

&gt; However economic growth would stall under socialism with productivity dropping massively,  This makes the countries GDP drop

thats impying that GDP is the be all and end all of success, we only operate under than assumption because alls we've ever known as a modern society is capitalism being required for jobs to be done, but when over a 3rd of population feels their job is meaningless, surely that means all the worlds problems are fixed right? no?

so rather than having 37% of people who feel their job is meaningless, why not put them to work on problems that need fixing.

Every country is currently in their own competitive bubble of GDP, without worrying about whats actually important to a happy, healthy society.

Jobs that are meaningless can be automated and those that had those jobs to give the impression of self worth can contribute in other ways, You have no way of knowing if productivity would drop, if we had a lot of people working less hours on week on mandatory jobs. 

instead we give them free time to work on what they are passionate about.

&gt;  businesses have to fold

if a business folds in an attempt to make the average worker happy then it wasn't economically viable.

I think countries are too obsessed with a public image of 'growth' as we describe it but the country (not the people) on track to improving numbers, trickle down doesn't work, because even when countries are successful with GDP (the U.S) there is still huge inequality in society, millions in poverty and millions without access to basic requirements such as affordable healthcare.


&gt; However I do believe that if the country went too far to the left economically it would end up hurting the people that it hopes to protect. 

i think we are already there conservatively, 800,000 children in poverty for the next decade, on a scale, I think the country can afford to go more left than right.",null,0,null,1439491660,null,null,false,0,cu1vq20,null,t3_3gtqtr,null,null,null,t1_cu1v1hh,null,null,null,1441230991,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null
