The p11d (percentage of list price) affects your personal allowance. For example, because of my company car, I lose £5500 from my personal allowance, and then an additional £4000 for having a fuel card (business and personal mileage). 

You then pay an ADDITIONAL tax on a monthly basis, which depends on the CO2 emissions and the level of tax you pay. 
So the 2k tax break is only what you lose from your personal allowance, you also get taxed more throughout the year.

It's worth remembering though that most companies offer cash-in-lieu if you want to buy your own car instead. So you're not getting that money (easily £30k+ per year for a high-flying £150k+ earner), you're getting taxed  per month (a Mercedes E220 Estate SE (i.e. basic) will set you back £300 a month if you earn above the 45% threshold) AND you're losing that £2k tax break.

The problem is it isn't, in that case, you probably have threaten them, you have assaulted them, it is battery, and ABH, you have purposely punched them, there is no accidental punching. Then the outcome of death is an unfortunate occurrence that no one wanted. But in those cases they have meant to assault them and cause harm, here you could easily argue that that isn't the case, the guy is drunk and unsteady on his feet, he isn't threatening or attacking anyone, it could easily be argued that his stumbling is an accident than a malicious act, however of course the same could be argued in the other directions, but I think we can all agree, given the act the outcome is exceptional, you knock into 100 people a 100 times, this is pretty much the worse case outcome and it is hard to rule on worse case outcomes, without the trial becoming unfair or setting a silly precedent for future rulings.

&gt;  If you shove someone, it turns out that they're exceedingly frail and your shove as just broken a hip, then you're looking at a charge of GBH.

Exactly if you shove them, but does he shove this person? You would have to be using a very liberal definition of the term shove to class it as that, it is a tap or knock at worst, it is the outcome that is terrible not the act and then the reaction to the outcome that is disgusting. But to take another example, if someone walks in the road and gets hit by a car and someone laughs at it, that doesn't make someone a criminal, just a dick, of course that doesn't directly relate to this because they have effected the person causing the outcome.

If you were having to choose between, say, KCL, and then a couple of less reputable institutions (that you perhaps preferred) then you'd have a question and a point. However choosing one very good university over another won't matter much, if at all.

I'd look at it as like secondary schools (but sort of in reverse...I'll explain).

When applying to university, they don't really look at your school, and won't take it into account unless it's one of the top public or grammar schools (Eton, St Paul's, etc). Going to one comprehensive over another won't change a thing - it's about your grades.

Conversely, the universities won't care as long as it's one of the top ones. Obviously Oxbridge would get your foot in the door (but by no means guaranteed).

**Price of product:** £2.99 for 75ml/2.5 US Fl.Oz.

**Where did you purchase:** Boots

**Product claims:** *""This anti-ageing hand cream deeply hydrates and smooths skin, reducing the appearance of fine lines. The non-greasy formula contains 5 star SPF 15 to protect skin from the damaging effects of UVA/UVB rays. Dermatologically Tested.*

*Active plant extract, Ginkgo, is packed with anti-oxidants that work to protect skin from external damage, helping skin look younger for longer.*

*Our beauty scientists have worked with the world experts in plant science at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (England), to bring you beautiful, plant-powered skincare that's proven to work.""*

**About you:** Easily tanned hands, dried out by excessive paper handling due to work.

**Your opinion:** New hand cream favourite! Previous was The Face Shop Vita Berry, but I think the prolonged exposure to the alcohol ended up negating the moisture completely.

The scent is a lot lighter than the super overpowering No7 Protect &amp; Perfect, so light that it's closer to a generic cream smell. It's not as good at moisturising as the No7 but hasn't ended up drying up my hands from prolonged use, and there is a bit of a greasy feel initially for me. But like the No7 it has excellent UVA protection and unlike all the others I've tried so far the value for money factor is hard to beat so I'm content for now.

Stoke away is tough, as is Tottenham at home. Sunderland away has been a bogey fixture in recent seasons, though they're not playing great so who knows. Villa are resurgent atm, Leicester are in a relegation battle and then free fall or not, City won't be easy.  

If we get a good points return from the last 6 games in the region of 10 points, we'd still be assuming City only get 5 out of 6 games, and I think that is asking too much no matter how out of form. 3 wins out of their last 6 would likely secure it for them, as I can't see them losing enough points given their run in too.

With that in mind I'd think it'd be better for us if City beat Tottenham (assuming we could manage to beat Tottenham too) to help us secure Europa League. We may lose a few players that way, which will be a shame, but for the club and fans as a whole that'd be incredible.

There's something that irks me in the first one, I'll quote it: 

**How can trade in food products be simplified without compromising food safety standards on both sides of Atlantic?**

*Having differences in our food safety legislation doesn’t mean that it is not possible to facilitate trade for agricultural products. Trade is not always hindered by the level of protection, but rather by red tape.*

*If you want to sell certain European product on the US market, you need to go through an import application procedure that could take up to 10 years because of the burdens of the data that you need to provide, and the fact that inspections that you have done with one member state are not acceptable in other member states. This is an extremely complex procedure.*

*One of the things that we believe should be possible in this agreement is simplifying the import application procedure for food products. Let us take an example of inspection: When there is a problem with food exported from the US to Europe, we often accept it and we do not need to inspect further their food manufacturing facility. But the USA often requires inspections of European food manufacturing facilities. There are a lot of things that will not affect the level of consumer protection, but rather ensure that we have less complicated procedures.*



For one, he's acting as if the US has the superior food standards. That is a nontruth. He's drawing attention away from the EU's higher standards. It's weird he keeps drawing attention away from the EU regulations, in favor of the supposedly very strict American food standard that the EU will have to reach. In addition, he wants to 'simplify' inspections, obviously so it's easier for the EU to reach those apparently high American inspection standards. What he fails to mention, is that in America the corporations are responsible for their own research and inspections. That does not fly here, but obviously he would like it to, because it is, after all, only red tape. 

 That second article also has a ridiculous load of political doubletalk in it. Call me a cynic, but I wouldn't trust them as far as I could throw them.

The short answer is *yes* in England and Wales.

The long answer is that whilst you will be liable the civil courts may, at most, award a nominal sum (a few pounds, certainly not hundreds), because they will take into account the motive of the trespasser.

Clearly, however, if you hide on your property with a gun waiting to shoot a persistent trespasser, you will be assessed somewhat differently and the penalties will be more severe (including prison time).

Some easy trips out by train from Cardiff are Penarth pier and Barry Island - both are seaside resorts that have undergone bit revamps in the last couple of years. Barry Island in particular has a lovely beach and nice walks. 

Castell Coch ('red castle' in English) is a nice bike ride from Cardiff up the 'Taff Trail' cycle path. Cardiff has some wonderful parks - take a walk through Bute Park and Roath Park while you are here.

In town there are some good shops. As well as the big chains/department stores, you should check out the independent shops in the historic arcades. I love Spillers Records, supposedly the oldest record shop in the world. If you are feeling homesick, visit New York Deli for bagels and coffee. 

Cardiff is famous for its nightlife. The city centre can get quite wild on weekends but you can have a quieter/more cultural time if you prefer, depends where you go. If you like beer, try the City Arms or Chapter Arts Centre's cafe/bar for a wide choice of local and guest beers. 

In terms of restaurants, I often prefer ones outside the centre. Some to try: Bangkok Cafe, Ichiban and Chai Street in Canton. Vegetarian Food Studio in Grangetown. Canteen on Clifton Street in Splott. Milgi in Roath. 

Take a trip down to Cardiff Bay by boat, bus or train - visit the Senedd (Welsh Assembly) - the do tours. Also the Millennium Centre and Norwegian Church. There is a big Dr Who exhibition and also location tours for that and Torchwood if you like those shows. If the weather is good, walk (or hire a bike) and go across the Cardiff Bay barrage and back. Great views across the channel to England.

I don't personally like sport, but if you do, try to go to a rugby game, especially the internationals if you can. You can take tours of the Millennium Stadium too, which could be fun.

My favourite museum is a short bus ride out of town - St Fagan's museum of Welsh life. Reconstructed buildings from around Wales - a good way to get a sense of Wales' history and culture. Well worth a visit.

If they have been given permission to errect the sign by someone then the next question is ""does the person who gave them permission have the right do so?"".

If the person who gave the letting agent is the owner of a house who has some rights over the communal gargens, then they may very well have the right to allow an agent to errect such a sign.  But it will depend on the deeds, probably.  

So try and find out if one of the houses in that block is being rented, and see if you can find the deeds to the property via the land registry, and see if the deeds grant such permission.

They may - and probably do - have the same rights that come with your property. You don't say if you rent or own it, but if you own it see what your deeds say.

Why did these concepts not arise in Rome? Or Greece? Why did al-Andalus not produce these ideas?

If the equality of man is such a universalistic concept then why does it have such a hard time taking root in Muslim societies for example?

Correlation is a useful starting point. Using to make conclusions, however, is not a good idea.

I grew up watching the Jon Pertwee, Tom Baker, and Peter Davison episodes--they were out of first run, of course, but my PBS station never got them anywhere close to new.  I still remember them taking it off the air, finally--this would have been about 1987 or 88--and writing to the station asking them to bring it back.  I wish I still had the letter I got in reply (basically explaining how they get their programming, and that the decision was above their level).

During the ""wilderness years"", I still was fascinated with Doctor Who, even though it was off the air, and even though I was moving on to other shows (I was always a huge sci-fi fan, and Star Trek: TNG was my thing then).  But my library still had a ton of DW books, mostly novelizations of the Davison-era stories (though I remember checking out the TARDIS technical manual so many times that I probably wore it out).  My parents hated going into the downtown area where the library was, so I got my books via the bookmobile; the mobile librarians knew me, and would pick up every Doctor Who book they could lay hands on for me.

When the movie came out, I was really excited.  I watched it with the kind of ""shut up, leave me alone"" intensity that British fans say was the rule during the classic series run.  I didn't know Sylvester McCoy's Doctor then--my channel never got to him--but I knew vaguely that he was the last Doctor of the show, and I was thrilled that they just picked up from his era.  Watching with teenage eyes (I was 17 then), I didn't see anything ridiculous about Paul McGann's portrayal, though now I compare it to his appearance in The Night of the Doctor and think that his first appearance was kind of silly by comparison--Paul, if you happen to haunt this sub (unlikely, I know), I think you're great, and never got the opportunity you deserved, but that appearance was definitely a product of its times, too.  At any rate, mostly I was just a little disturbed by the way the Master regenerated (the whole snake thing), and surprised (but secretly excited) by how different the TARDIS was.

After the movie, I did move on, and while I never forgot the show, it got relegated to memory.  I spent the next decade or more far too busy to get back to it, though I would have loved to.  It was well into David Tennant's tenure when I discovered that the show was back on the air--that's how far removed I had become--but the minute I discovered it (with a rerun of The Satan Pit, if I remember correctly), it was like my entire childhood flooding back.

&gt;“We’ve not robbed our social services departments to make it look like we have artificially inflated our health service budget”


&gt;The Conservatives have consistently baited Miliband with the indisputable fact that, unique among the four home nations, Wales has cut its health budget in real terms since 2010. “That’s simply a distortion of the truth”, says Drakeford. The reality, he insists, is that the Welsh government has protected health and social services spending because they see them as one joint, and vital, single package of services, given so many people – especially the elderly – rely on both. “Our critics are distorting the strategy that we’ve had, which is to fund the system in the round. It’s no use to an older person to find themselves admitted to a hospital that appears to have had its budget protected, only for them to find that they can’t return to their home because social services are no longer there to support them.”


&gt;Welsh government figures show that since 2010, health and social care together have been receiving a growing share of a budget that has been reducing. In 2010-11, they accounted for 41.3% of Wales’s total budget. It was 42.5% in 2014-15 and will rise again, to 43.4%, or £6.7bn of the government’s £15bn total spend, in the year just starting.

My introduction to Doctor Who was reading about Daleks, Cybermen and K-9 in a book about fictional robots when I was 10 or so. I immediately wanted to know what this Doctor Who show was but the closest I could get were the Target novelisations I found at a library. I ran through their collection in pretty much random order and loved it all.

I then hunted at every bookstore for those I hadn't read (and my favorites that I had) and I ended up with a collection of maybe 50-60 books that are still packed away in a box at my mom's house. :) Besides the novelisations I also had a few Doctor Who quiz books, a programme guide and a book of monsters also published by Target that helped me piece together the Whoniverse.

The first show I watched was The Sontaran Experiment, a fourth Doctor adventure. A classmate at school had brought back a VHS tape of it from one of his vacations abroad. (Rich kids, eh? ;) )

Much later in the 2000s, I got to watch more ""classic"" Doctor Who and the revived show from 2005 thanks to DVDs borrowed from the British Council Library in India.

In return, EU companies can buy bits of the U.S. healthcare system (which is already privatised) and possibly bits of their education system. Also, there is free trade and movement with the U.S. This benefits companies, so the Conservatives are in full support of it. UKIP also think it's brilliant for reasons known only to themselves. The Liberal Democrats support it (probably because they support all that is evil). Labour does not support it but says it will not try to block it in the European Parliament. The Green Party are the only party willing to do anything about it so will try to block it. The reason the government wants nobody to talk about it is that it's supposed to be secret and the European Parliament are not very happy that the British public even know it's name.

EDIT: The privatisation of the education system is expected to be opposed at all levels but is in the draft bill. It is likely to be removed in the final treaty.

And lo and behold, the poll results suggest that those who align themselves with Republicanism are a mere 9% more populous than those who align themselves with Unionism (if we assume this is a fair sample of the active contributors to this sub-reddit, which is up for debate).

If you think that Republican viewpoints are more popular here, it's literally because there are slightly more people with that viewpoint.  

I've also heard people say that the DUP get a lot of bashing in the comment threads. Again, there is no insidious agenda by Sinn Fein keyboard warriors here, the poll results suggest that the two biggest parties represented on this sub-reddit are Alliance and Sinn Fein.

Bath is lovely, but I only went to one open day there and don't know too much about it so it'd probably be better to ask someone else. It's student satisfaction is great and bath is an excellent uni.

My sister went to Warwick, it's a very good uni, though bear in mind its much closer to Coventry, which was bombed to hell in WW2 and is now full off some of the most disgusting architecture in the country and is a bit of a shithole, and that unfortunately is where you'd go for things like nights out.

The material on my AliExpress shirt isn't the same as the legit one. The color is correct, the barely-there stripes in the blue exist, but the actual fabric is more shiny, and less breathable. I often wondered how anyone could play a sport in an umbro kit 'til I got my legit shirt.

The stitching isn't as nicely presented. It all holds up, but stray threads need trimming, etc. The Everton patch is a little less fancy looking -- stitching is just a bit sloppier than the legit; it's by NO stretch of the imagination BAD, just not as nice looking in direct comparison.

Names and numbers I couldn't directly compare as it was UEFA vs BPL, but they look good.

[Some photos in poor lighting](http://imgur.com/a/WQrUD)

Of note - my shirt took at least 6 weeks before it even shipped (and husband had to hassle them by email a little to ask about it), and then another week after shipping to arrive (to midwest US).

Overall, if you're looking for a thrifty kit, it's pretty good. On the other hand, I've read that all kits go on extensive sale through Everton Direct in the off-season.

Living as an adult 30 or 40 years ago would be fine, I mean I like the internet and all but I am smart, practical and not prone to getting ill. I'd probably be okay in most decades. I don't think that was the point you were trying to make though.

Conflating all aspects of life 30 years ago with a single aspect such as economic equality is a bad argument. If I was black, or a miner, so on and so forth then obviously I would be worse off than I am now.

&gt;Why do we need to decrease the gap?

Because its [better](http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2011/09/berg.htm) for the [economy](http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2011/sdn1108.pdf)^^^^pdf for a start (which I think is the argument which will appeal most to you) and its better for people in general, life expectancies are longer. People are able to stay in education for longer. Crime rates are lower.

&gt;Who decides what's ""fair"" or not?


Not me, but to me fairness is irrelevant. Better levels of equality equal a better society.

I don't buy that the SNP are coordinating these people at the highest level, but there are certainly elements within the SNP ranks that are completely at ease with mindlessly hating everyone that isn't them. Being of a nationalist mindset enables an ""us vs them"" mentality to be acceptable.

There's already a clear distinction for what is and isn't a christian country and its the question of whether or not there is an established state religion.

I appreciate the eagerness of secularists (myself included) to distance the UK from its  christian roots but until the head of state isn't the ""Keeper of *the* faith"" they'll always be jumping the gun.

I expect this will be resolved when they bring up the no doubt gigantic bucket of evidence they will have that it is a very genuine relationship.  

It specifically states they didn't submit enough evidence, but doesn't state at all what they did submit.  That's what's news here!  If they submitted 10,000 photos together over 45 years and got rejected, that's clearly absurd; but if all they submitted was their marriage certificate; well maybe requesting more evidence might be appropriate as a general rule.

&gt;Summers said, adding the paperwork for her appeal includes numerous photographs chronicling their decades as both partners and parents to a now 42-year-old son.

It seems she didn't submit these first time.

Furthermore, shouldn't she have applied for Family visa *before* moving to the UK, rather than attempting to get one *after* buying property here.  She clearly didn't attempt to apply for the correct visa until she had already been to Malta!

It was at this point that she decided to apply for an extended visa that would grant her the same travel permissions as David, who holds a British passport.

&gt;That application included a copy of her marriage license dated 1970 and a change of name deed from 1985. 

I would call that minimal evidence!

&gt;Summers said the entire family changed surnames at that time for personal reasons.

I am also **personally** aware of foreign nationals who have stayed married solely for immigration purposes *after* the end of the relationship, I support UKBA requesting appropriate evidence.

Information regarding a visa to join a UK partner is here: https://www.gov.uk/browse/visas-immigration/family-visas

It's clear that you only get 6 months unless you apply for the visa before hand.  She literally expected to be able to move here without a visa before hand, and of course can't.

However, if she'd followed the procedure correctly, it should have been easy to show she qualifies for this unless there's something they're not telling us: https://www.gov.uk/right-of-abode/commonwealth-citizens (e.g. remarriage.)

So, as I said, for the price quality is pretty fantastic. The Iconic range are excellent and dupes for the more expensive urban decay Naked palettes. The iconic 1 is a dupe for Naked 1 etc. I also picked myself up one of their ""own"" palettes which wasn't a dupe because the colours were so fantastic - [Iconic Dreams](http://www.makeuprevolutionstore.com/index.php/palettes/iconic/iconic-dreams.html). It is gorgeous but I haven't used it yet.

They have recently released an [Iconic Elements](http://www.superdrug.com/Make-Up/Eyes/Eye-Shadow-Palettes/Makeup-Revolution-Redemption-Palette-Iconic-Elements/p/446400#.VSrRHvmUeCk) which is a dupe for the 2 Naked Basics palettes in one. 

I recently bought the [Iconic Pro 1](http://www.superdrug.com/Make-Up/Eyes/Eye-Shadow-Palettes/Makeup-Revolution-Salvation-palette-Iconic-Pro-1/p/446600) - a dupe for the Lorac Pro, and I adore it. I have a lot of palettes yet am reaching for it pretty much constantly since I got it. The pigmentation is fantastic, no fallout and long lasting. The texture is great and they feel much more expensive than they actually cost.

If you're interested in dupes they also have a dupe for [Too Faced chocolate bar](http://www.makeuprevolutionstore.com/index.php/palettes/i-makeup-chocolate-palette/i-makeup-i-heart-chocolate.html) which I bought for a friend and she said it was great.

I replied to OP regarding Police Scotland separately, however the SFS is essentially the same rationale. Both services now have more local involvement than they did in the past, and they're no longer structured around the now non-existent 1970s local authority organisation.

&gt;Overruling local councils on planning matters, largely around wind turbines.

This is largely an unfortunate side effect of devolution, however I don't think it's a good example of 'centralisation'.

Energy policy is explicitly reserved and so arguably the only lever that the Scottish Government has to shape energy generation (which isn't just wind) is by [using the planning system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_policy_of_Scotland).

That's clearly not what planning should be used for, but if you want Scotland to be able to take a different path to the UK in terms of energy production then you use the tools you have rather than the tools you'd like.

&gt; Freezing council funding with an ""agreement"" that stipulated any councils that refused would have their funding grant from the Scottish Government reduced to equal whatever they gain from raising council tax.

The same system is [operated by the UK Government](https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/making-sure-council-tax-payers-get-good-value-for-money/supporting-pages/council-tax-freeze).

If councils want additional funding they need to stick to an agreed limit, if councils don't want that funding they're free to ignore it and set whatever level of council tax they like.

&gt;Taking control of colleges.

Some colleges [have merged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_further_education_colleges_in_Scotland) as a result of the new 'college regions' structure but I fail to see how that's really ""centralisation"". That we had one particular arrangement of colleges in the 1990s doesn't mean that those colleges must last forever.

Indeed, some of those colleges were themselves formed by merging previous colleges - Aberdeen College has been merged with Banff and Buchan College, but Aberdeen College was itself a merger of three older colleges.",null,0,null,1428869487,null,0,false,0,cqa32o2,null,t3_32b8yo,null,t1_cqa32o2,null,t1_cqa1u4u,null,null,null,1432351548,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

You seem desperate to find a racism angle. When you walk by yourself who are you going to intimidate? Who are you going to threaten? What's being white got anything to do with it?

But if you get together with a group of males - no matter what your colour - then police interest in you will be piqued especially depending on what you wear and how you present. All wearing suits and ties? Probably not a problem. Look like a bunch of university geeks in T-shirts, jeans, and scruffy hair? Probably not a problem.

It is when you're in a group presenting yourself as an intimidating group that you'll get the most attention from the police. And rightly so.

Now you're *desperate* to find a racism angle in this. But you've not stopped to ask the person above why the police are so interested in him and his friends. What were they wearing? How were they acting? Is it reasonable or foreseeable that lone members of the public may feel threatened or intimidated by them?

I was hooked. 

I guess I was one of the few lucky ones that had cable and thus UK Gold and they played classic Who every Sunday? morning.

Yes, Those That Must Not Be Mentioned. There was a group called Floorten and they made some excellent little stories that have shaped how I make my own fan audios (see www.doctorwho.damproductions.org) and then there were the likes of ""Time and Again"" featuring Dennis Kuhn as a quasi-McGann fan doctor and it was exciting and new and different and I loved it.

&gt; The youngest recorded member of the junior IRA to die in the Troubles is thought to be 12-year-old Cathleen McCartland. She was killed in what was described as a ""roof-top"" accident in west Belfast in August 1973. She was claimed at the time as a member of the female junior IRA wing, Cumann na gCaillini, but her name has been removed from republican memorials.

This is nonsense the memorial plaque is [still there](http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/viggiani/images/MURALS/Belfast/Republicans/Local%20IRA%202.jpg). Cumann na gCaillini was a youth wing but no one that age was on Active service, this girl fell off a roof.

&gt; Another girl soldier, Eileen Mackin (14) from west Belfast, was killed by the accidental discharge of weapon during an arms training session in Ballymurphy in May 1973. Her name too appears to have been expunged from official republican record.

Historically, yes the rates have been ridiculous, buts it's a political issue now for two reasons: a lot of people are mortgaged to the hilt; many people (who also are likely to vote) have their retirement plans based on high house prices.

Same here, the only negative effect it does have, that affects everyone is the Sunday trading laws.

Other than that, it's just like every other religion, I tend to ignore it, let people do what they want to do and get on with my life.

We're lucky enough it isn't so far ingrained in our culture any more that it's affecting laws more further afield than what times the shops can open.  It doesn't have a presence in school really, personal freedoms such as who you're allowed to marry or what you do with your body, whilst getting a lot of reaction from some Christian groups, aren't defined by Christianity anymore.

Certain social expectation or judgements such as sex before marriage, single parent families etc are more or less gone.

We may have been built as a Christian country, and it may still be there as a backdrop, but with a few exceptions it doesn't really affect anyone unless they choose to engage in it which is as it should be IMO.

You wouldn't. You think GlaxoSmithKline would be the size it is? BP? Shell? Did you read about the recent Shell merger/takeover of BG? You think that would happen?

The simple fact is for there to be any sort of industry you need financial services. It is the UKs largest export and frankly your term of ""destructive business"" just goes to show you don't understand the industry and have no clue what you are talking about. Educate yourself before making statements such as you have made.

I would point out we are not good at only one thing, we have two of the top three largest oil companies in the world based in the UK, we have some of the largest mining companies (Glencore Xstrata), largest pharmaceuticals companies (shire and GSK), telecoms companies (vodaphone).

I wanted to try Python because this is one of my first projects and I felt more comfortable using Flask.

I decided to go for sliders because it makes the scoring algorithm more relevant for the person taking the quiz. If for example a parties score score (1 being against, 0 being for) is 0.32, then having a sliding scale would be much more precise than having lots of radio buttons that represent ranges. I'll try some other options and see how they are though.

At the time I thought it was in need of a serious refresh. Most people hated it. Its ratings were very low. One thing to understand: you couldn't admit to liking Doctor Who. You would be mercilessly taunted and ridiculed. Geek culture was not mainstream - geeks were treated like sad loners. Today it's the opposite, you can wear a comic book hero t-shirt and it is accepted as fashionable. Also there weren't as many female fans. The vast majority were male. Thankfully this has changed now and females are on board. But if you told me back then that in 20 years Doctor Who would be a worldwide universally loved hit that girls were fans of too, I would not have believed you. 

I'm glad it went off the air and that JNT was no longer involved. They did a charity song 'Doctor In Distress' to get the show back on air. It was an abysmal embarrassment and only added to the public perception of it being shit. It stayed on air a few more years. Then it was cancelled. 

If you're interested, read [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/g9tlq/when_the_classic_series_ended_heres_what_happened/) I wrote a while ago about the wilderness years.

Star Trek TNG sort of filled the gap. The TV movie was a surprise and I enjoyed it. Then every so often there was a rumour of it coming back, maybe as a cartoon, movie etc. By then I knew it was a question of when, not if. 

This show is a true phenomenon. I'm still amazed ten years on since its return.

People are quick to write him off because he only has 1 assist and no goals, but I don't think anyone has watched them this year. Their defense is atrocious, and morale is certainly at an all time low. How do people really expect to give him grief about his assist numbers when all of their strikers COMBINED have less than 10 goals in league play? You're not going to get assists if nobody wants to finish your passes. Even Adler, who has been a mainstay in the German squad and looked to take the number 1 shirt before it was given to Neuer is being made look average at best. 

Check the stats: http://www.espnfc.us/club/hamburg-sv/127/squad

They have 8 goals in the BL amongst their 3 strikers. Their leading scorers are two 30+ vets in Olic (5) and VDV (4). That's a problem, and only 3 midfielders, including VDV have scored goals all season. I mean seriously... They have 19 goals all season! Their leading scorer has 5 goals!!!! You're asking if an attacking mid is having a good season on a team that gets pinned back in their own half for 80% their games. Then you look at his performances for Fulham who were of similar quality to Hamburg this year, and he nearly won player of the season even though he only joined on loan in January! 

People are taking his numbers out of the context of the team he is on. 

Here's an example! Before Harry really got a look into the team, Eriksen didn't have any assists, and we clearly struggled to score goals. He's in a similar situation, just a season long one.

Police, planning, council tax?

Planning is the only one that I think could be seen as centralisation, but even then that power was exercised by previous Holyrood administrations too.

The Higher Education Governance Bill? That was proposed in 2012 but it hasn't actually been passed yet. Even when it is passed it won't give the Scottish government control over college boards.

The [consultation paper](http://www.gov.scot/Resource/0046/00462633.pdf) from 2012 is still a good summary of what's involved. The most controversial aspects of it are that chairs for University boards must be elected and that governing bodies should include people like student representatives, associated trade unions, and ex-staff. You can read some of the University arguments as to why they shouldn't [have elections here](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/scottish-universities-attack-governance-bill/2019606.article).

Fact is, he doesn't do that anymore. The team gets run off the pitch in the middle of the field, nearly every game. Doesn't matter if its barca or burnley.

We have some very good players, who work extremely hard for the team. And then we have yaya, who is one of the highest earners and is all but guaranteed to play every match for some reason. 

And he simply couldn't care less. His body or his attitude, one of the two, is no longer allowing him to play well in any aspect of the game. He is a liability, and it really isn't coming from someone looking to pick on certain players during a rough patch with the club. He really is fuckall useless. His attitude is shit, and this is the worst part of it.

When you have just one player who slacks off and doesn't do his part, the whole system loses its shape and falls apart.  It pulls certain players out of position, it slows the attack.  The team cannot press the opposition if yaya is on the field.

You need to find a law (or precedent) that shows this is the case, and I'm not convinced it is against the law.

When you say

""The fact that they're allowed to use the full version of the electoral register as a cheap and convenient mailing list doesn't allow them to contact everybody on the full register.""

You need to consider the line before:

You might find that your local Labour Party / Tories / Lib Dems doesn't bother checking if you're registered with the Mailing Preference Service or have sent the party a data protection notice. If so, they're breaching either the Direct Marketing Association's code of practice and/or the Data Protection Act 1998. 

Breaching the DMA's code of practice isn't illegal, and because you haven't sent a Data Protection Notice, it doesn't breach the Data Protection Act either.  

I'm not seeing any illegalities here.

Your argument was that people move because they can earn more money overseas, I've shown they can earn more money and yet they don't move.

I see ""centralising"" as implying the removal of local autonomy and replacing it with central government control (particularly when the implication is that the government that took that decision did so to increase their own power in that area).

I don't think that's what happened. Indeed the structure of Police Scotland requires more local involvement than there was in the past, and the creation of a new independent body that separates the police from ministers.

Look at somewhere like Glasgow. Over time they've been covered by the City of Glasgow Police, Strathclyde Police, and Police Scotland. That these bodies all merged together over time doesn't imply centralisation to me, as the key question there is how much local accountability there is. I would say what's happened with policing is just consolidation, not centralisation.

At this time it felt like it belonged to us. We were debating on rec.arts.drwho pre-web, keeping the flame alive, and for me it's wrapped up in discovering you could talk with people around the world on the ""internet"" for the first time.

The fans were even writing most of the New Adventures books, and many of these were truly great and were trying new things in a way the new show simply isn't. It wasn't just a nostalgia fest - the editors forbade reusing old monsters for the first year at least. And the Daleks were never allowed due to ownership issues. This meant they were forced to be inventive and not just rely on ""X is back!"". And when they did bring the Ice Warriors and the Cybermen etc into it they had interesting ideas and were used sparingly, as classic monsters weren't essential like they are now. Although some of the good ideas from the NAs have in fact carried over, I must say.

Now I look back I realize that for me growing up Doctor Who was only half show and half the Target novelizations of the show. The actual show was ephemeral, caught once and then gone in the days long before you could buy stories on VHS. The novelizations were how I experienced them again and again, and discovered the older and missing stories. And in books the effects were always great - having grown up with the Tomb Of The Cybermen novelization when the story was found it was quite a bit less impressive! So the New Adventures were a good fit for me.

That is what happened with the 50% tax rate, it actually took less money, because people who could actively avoid it did, at 45% it is so similar to other equivalent nations it either isn't worth the hassle or at least isn't going to save you much.

I think pumping in with that level of noise and passion against some of the other teams we played at Loftus Road, we might have swayed things a bit for a point or two more.

Rob Green has pulled off some amazing shot stops over the course of the season, but as I mentioned on the other thread his distribution is just so sketchy. I thought the midfield were ok today in challenging in the air, but there have been other times when I wished Green could put it out with a little bit more finesse.

Edit: But I don't want to be overly harsh on Green. In the catalogue of mistakes this season, there have been costlier ones: Austin's missed penalty against Hull, Vargas' conceding the penalty at Stamford Bridge, Traoré and Yun switching off when Sterling took his free kick against Liverpool, Barton red card at Hull...

I'm a tad concerned over what McCarthy will do in the summer. Another year sat on his arse might not be what he was expecting here. 

I don't think we were helped in our very limited options from the bench. When you have to have three kids who haven't even been out on loan dressed and ready, you know you've got problems.

Warming to Ramsey again after the last few performances after the bizarre decision to roll SWP out for a game. We have a nice storyline coming up with him I guess, because I'm pretty sure there's a job waiting for him at Villa if he wants it.

I'm still pessimistic about our chances though. It's just a bit gutting that we'll finish so low when we've really only posted a handful of truly dreadful performances throughout the season.

I haven't read the entire white paper but I've read enough to see that the utopia of an independent Scotland isn't likely to happen. Much of what is planned is increased spending while tax remains the same (recently revealed however that government spending would be slashed even more than it currently is in England). Recent plans in regards to the implementation of Devo max have shown a black hole of £6.6 billion according to the telegraph, £12 billion according to the herald scotland, £40 billion according to the express (as of march this year). Oil has continuously played a big part in the planning of an independent Scotland but with the fall in the price of oil and the amount of oil left, it's clear this isn't likely to be feasible.   It's true that more tax is collected in Scotland (something like £10,000 compared to £9,000. about 9.1% of of UK tax with a population that is 8.3% of the UK total.) but quite a large part of that is from oil (completely remove oil from the equation and it's 8.2%) and spending per person is higher (£12,500 compared to £11,000. 9.3% of spending for 8.3% of the population). Figures are from the BBC. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-28879267 They are just under a year old so the only real difference is that the oil price has fallen dramatically causing a drop in the tax that would be collected, and the coalition government has continued deficit reduction in England meaning slightly less money spent. 
An independent Scotland is feasible but the huge black hole in it's finances would mean far deeper cuts than are being implemented and policies and reform that have been stopped from happening by the government in Hollyrood being implemented to balance the books.
As for banks warning against an independent Scotland, they'd keep the local branches open but the investment into small and medium business would drop significantly. yes they like money but if they aren't going to get the money they loaned to people back then they wont want to give it out.
I think tommyncfc mentions trident because of the direct jobs it provides. The maintenance of nuclear submarines and their facilities aren't exactly transferable.

Iowa Public Television eventually started showing other British science fiction shows like Red Dwarf and Blakes 7 together with Doctor Who in a block of programming called Sci-Fi Friday Night. It was a great time and we even had a live chat set up to get together during episodes at [SFFN.COM](http://www.sffn.com/),  I wish I had kept in closer touch with everyone who was a part of it over the years. At least [U.N.I.T](https://www.facebook.com/groups/480321935314687/) ""United Network of Iowa Timelords"" is still going. 
Man... [Mike Frisbie](https://www.facebook.com/MikeFrisbeezSciFiFriday) was such a great host for those shows. Getting to see him record some of the pre show clips was amazing.

For a Doctor Who fan, Wilderness Years or not, Iowa is such a great place - considering [IPTV has been showing it almost continuously since 1974!](https://venusianspearmint.wordpress.com/2013/11/13/doctor-whos-american-age-is-pushing-40-because-of-only-one-state/)

Anyway you didn't answer my question. I didn't ask why does the deficit have to be reduced, I asked why does it have to be reduced as fast as they are aiming? Why did they pick the 2017/18 figure, why did Labour pick the 2020 figure? As long as the deficit decreases &amp; eventually the debt too why do we need to rush this &amp; cause damage to our economy in the process? To my understanding while rates are low taking on new debt isn't the disaster it's made out to be. 

To my understanding all the major politicians have signed up to reducing the deficit, they just disagree about how long it should take or how we should go about doing it. The Tories are looking for cuts in public spending, Labour are looking for cuts in public spending &amp; increased taxes, the LD want to do the same as Labour but slightly less taxation, the SNP / Greens don't want to cut spending but do want to raise taxes more than all the other parties as well as raise the minimum wage to increase tax intake &amp; productivity.

You have to be a pretty terrible scientist if in the absence of any other data you choose a value that sounds about right and use it to make a face-value comparison.

It's totally the wrong comparison to make, it's like saying the average height of UK residents is higher than the Dutch because on average we weigh more. There might be a correlation between height and weight but it's a completely incorrect conclusion. Economics doesn't have controls but it does have normalisations and calculations that allow things to be compared better. 

Saying high taxes for top-rate earners doesn't make people move because they would have already moved to a country with higher average wages if they cared about money is the sort of comparison a child might make.

Slash the military budget. Save the billions that would have to be spent on Trident renewal, HS2, etc. Start an oil fund that can be paid into when oil prices are on the up, and taken from when necessary if they fall.

I graduated from HS in 1996, so the TV movie was right before graduation.  I grew up with VHS tapes from Sunday night Doctor Who and the occasional Blakes Seven. Novelizations and VHS tapes were how I watched Troughton, Pertwee and Tom Baker stories.  It wasn't until The Three Doctors came out on VHS that I saw a story in parts, before that they were released as a 90 minute movie.  The cliff hangers were edited out/together.  This was how the stories were on PBS as well, though I think they left in a cliff hanger halfway through.

I had a Doctor Who Magazine subscription at the local comic book store which kept me in touch with Doctor Who news.  When the New Adventures came out, I would read the books monthly, it was new Doctor Who for me.  I remember when BBC took over the license but didn't have USA distribution immediately.  That was a little silly.

Once Amazon came into being (1997-ish), it was easier to buy the books, I was also able to order them from the UK.

&gt;Catholic: 50% | Protestant: 41% | Difference: 9%

&gt;So I hope this lays to rest any ideas of a 'Republican agenda' afoot in this sub-reddit. 
If you think that Republican viewpoints are more popular here, it's literally because there are slightly more people with that viewpoint.  

33% more in fact. And you do realise that bolsters the argument, not 'lays [it] to rest'...

&gt;I've also heard people say that the DUP get a lot of bashing in the comment threads. Again, there is no insidious agenda by Sinn Fein keyboard warriors here, the poll results suggest that the two biggest parties represented on this sub-reddit are Alliance and Sinn Fein.

Slashing the military budget won't give Scotland enough money to fill the black hole. We spend just over 2% of GDP or 35ish billion on defence in the UK. Just under 10% will be 3.2 billion(or there abouts). Scotland plans on spending 2.5 billion on defence. So they save less than 1 billion. Trident renewal will be spread out until about 2030 and will probably be included in future defence budgets so not a great deal of money saved there.

Maybe US regulations will be improved and EU regulations will stay the same or improve in some areas but if that were the case then what exactly is the point of calling it a liberalisation treaty when it increases regulation? Why would US corporations be happy to support this process and voluntarily subject themselves to environmental or working standards regulations that they have consistently fought against for decades? It all seems totally illogical. Major corporations have been intensively consulted on the text of the treaty and I find it really hard to believe that they've been encouraging the US to regulate them as thoroughly as the EU unless there's some other way they are going to gain. 

I don't know either why the US government would be so happy to accept that the EU standard should be used as the new base line. Would there not be some compromise agreed where US regulations are improved and EU regulations weakened? I just doesn't seem likely to me - and if what I've said above is remotely true then you would expect significant secrecy about what exactly was being negotiated so that pressure groups and citizens themselves don't have time to organise like they did with ACTA. We would expect secretive cross-party agreements negotiated by lobbyists to ensure it passes first time before anybody has time to oppose it. 

When the UK government wanted to pass 'emergency' counter-terrorist legislation to further expand the secret services' mass surveillance infrastructure what happened? They secured the agreement of the main parties and despite protestations pushed it through parliament before anybody had even had time to read the legislation to ensure it passed. This sort of thing happens all the time. 

EDIT: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-28237111

Given how much money corporations and politicians stand to gain from TTIP I would be genuinely shocked if European politicians could not easily be offered kickbacks and indirect bribes to vote in favour of TTIP once certain favourable terms had been negotiated. 

Of course I could be totally wrong, but no-one can prove me wrong because we still have no information regarding what the text will took like or what specific issues are being negotiated (except through texts published by wikileaks). The European Commission has said it's fixed people's concerns about ISDS but they haven't published an updated proposed text so no-one has any way to know. The only reason EU position papers have been published is because of fierce public opposition. Had they had their way we wouldn't have known anything. 

I really really hope to be proved wrong because there are many good things that could come out of a comprehensive trade deal but I think until we actually know anything concrete we should be very sceptical and should make sure the Commission knows people have concerns and closed-doors political machinations will not be allowed. I don't believe the EU has provided any concrete reason at all why people who are concerned with the deal should be less worried. Maybe they will soon but they haven't yet. It's all just opinion about how good it will be and hopeful ideas of what we *might* get out of the treaty, nothing real.",null,0,null,1428884960,null,0,1428885226,0,cqabf92,null,t3_32bdez,null,t1_cqabf92,null,t1_cq9w591,null,null,null,1432355554,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

If a horse has a problem with something it won't do it. Horses don't bottle up thoughts and feelings because a bunch of evolved primates are counting on him.

Do you have a source for this? I've found multiple references to a 30 year moratorium on the publication of relevant documents agreed by the Commission before the negotiations began (admittedly all from interested pressure groups and citizen's right organisations) but no mention of a specific timescale for scrutiny by parliaments. 

I can understand why negotiation notes would need to be secret not least because you don't want the other side seeing them but why not at least keep people updated on what's been agreed so far.

There's an awful lot of fascinating stories that I did not touch upon, too - there's Caractacus (*Caradog*), who lead the resistance against the Romans after the initial invasion. After his final defeat, he was carried back to Rome with the spoils of war to be displayed and then executed in Claudius' Triumph. First, however, he was allowed to address the Senate directly, and the speech that he made so impressed them that they forestalled his execution, and he was allowed to live out the rest of his days with his family within the walls of the city:

""*If the degree of my nobility and fortune had been matched by moderation in success, I would have come to this City as a friend rather than a captive, nor would you have disdained to receive with a treaty of peace one sprung from brilliant ancestors and commanding a great many nations. But my present lot, disfiguring as it is for me, is magnificent for you. I had horses, men, arms, and wealth: what wonder if I was unwilling to lose them? If you wish to command everyone, does it really follow that everyone should accept your slavery? If I were now being handed over as one who had surrendered immediately, neither my fortune nor your glory would have achieved brilliance. It is also true that in my case any reprisal will be followed by oblivion. On the other hand, if you preserve me safe and sound, I shall be an eternal example of your clemency*.""

You seem to presume that the regulations that are going to be removed are those that protect EU citizens, despite this repeatedly being explained as not the case by senior EU officials. The kinds of NTBs that generally are going to be removed are those such as requiring dual certification for things where the standards are essentially the same. Both the EU and the US have similar regulations with respect to how water-tight tyres are meant to be (virtually identical even), however because there isn't mutual recognition of eachothers certification then the ceritification for the same aspect of tires has to be completed in each country, an extremely costly and time consuming endeavour when you have a lot of different areas that need testing. Not to mention that it stifles innovation, due to said cost. Not standard health, safety, and quality regulations. The EU isn't stupid, and if anything particularly egregious went through I imagine TTIP would be shot down the same way ACTA was by the EP.

&gt;Given how much money corporations and politicians stand to gain from TTIP I would be genuinely shocked if European politicians could not easily be offered kickbacks and indirect bribes to vote in favour of TTIP once certain favourable terms had been negotiated.

Bribing the EP + 28 national parliaments, directly or indirectly, is a gargantuan task, regardless, I find such talk of easily bribed politicians to be rather juvenile. There are certainly problems with things like the revolving door of politics, but nowhere near to the level of harm that you propose. As to much of the rest, such as the involvement of corporations, I would refer you to my other post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/32bdez/my_grandad_reads_the_paper_everyday_and_hasnt/cq9w6y2).

&gt;Of course I could be totally wrong, but no-one can prove me wrong because we still have no information regarding what the text will took like or what specific issues are being negotiated (except through texts published by wikileaks). The European Commission has said it's fixed people's concerns about ISDS but they haven't published an updated proposed text so no-one has any way to know. The only reason EU position papers have been published is because of fierce public opposition. Had they had their way we wouldn't have known anything.

Again, this is simply an area where you're completely wrong. The TTIP negotiations have been *the most transparent trade negotiations in history*. This isn't hyperbole, or exaggeration, this is fact. You say there is no information about what the final texts will contain, but that is just plain [wrong](http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/press/index.cfm?id=1230). The EU has published countless documents detailing positions, rationales for positions, what they hope to get out of it, where their red lines are, etc. Furthermore, the EC hasn't said that it has 'fixed' the concerns surrounding ISDS (most of which are completely overblown), [but that they've shelved negotiations on ISDS until they come up with something more acceptable to the public.](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-15-3201_en.htm). Regardless, this is as a result of people not even bothering to educate themselves about [how the EC has proposed to fix many of the potential abuses in ISDS](http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2013/november/tradoc_151916.pdf) which have been floating around for more than a year.

In this example you wouldn't actually be liable for any IHT on the property as your parents' combined allowance of £650,000 would cover your suggested increase in value. Also, your parents wouldn't be ""punished"", as the tax is paid by the person inheriting.

&gt;I agree with inheritance tax when it applies to the absolutely richest with plenty of liquid assets

Essentially what you're saying is the amount of tax payable should be determined not by the value of property changing hands but by the convenience of the recipient raising the funds to pay it. 

&gt;Despite my anti-neoliberal stance and want for equality as well as my utter disagreement with Tory policy I don't think the middle class should be in any way effected and raising the threshold to assets far above average wages seems far fairer.

Yes but as a part of the overall system a tax cut for IHT creates a shortfall that has to be made up elsewhere. That has to be done by either increasing other taxes (i.e. taxes on earned as opposed to unearned income) or through spending cuts (which disproportionately affect the poorest in society).

I've quoted this elsewhere but been told it's a shitty opinion piece. To my knowledge the New Scientist was reasonably reliable but there you go. 

&gt;Are you suggesting the debate will be behind closed doors? If so, why?

I have no idea, I guess we'll just have to wait and see how much money lobbyists are willing to throw at the problem. We know the government can force things through parliament as they did with [the 'emergency' terror laws last year](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-28237111). All you need is a cross-party agreement and the bill get's force through without anyone having had time to read it or consider it and in the face of huge opposition at the lack of democracy. We also nearly saw it with ACTA, the treaty was kept is total secrecy until 2011 at which point the contents outraged people and after widespread protest, petition and opposition from powerful internet based companies and the very public resignation of the European Parliament's rapporteur for the treaty which he called a 'masquerade', the parliament finally rejected the treaty. It's possible this will simply be another repeat - it's certainly following the same pattern. Years and years of secrecy followed by outrage at what the treaty actually contains except in this case all of corporate American is in favour and there would be no significant entities against. In other words if the public doesn't like it when it's published it likely won't matter because (rather like how opposition to ACTA was treated in the beginning) it will be dismissed by politicians as uninformed people making a fuss and an attempt will be made to pass it anyway. if lobbyists through enough money at people to ~~bribe~~ persuade them to vote in favour then we could indeed see it pass first time will very little debate at all. 

It really depends whether you trust that the government or the European Parliament is independent enough from the economic and political powers that stand to gain if a version of the treaty which fucks over the citizen and promotes big business is passed. I'm not sure and I'm certainly not going to take their word for it but I'm happy to change my mind should I see any evidence that the process will be transparent. The trouble is, if you insist on total secrecy it become very difficult to prove you have legitimate aims so I have to stay sceptical.

My daughter(she is 15 in a matter of days) and I have a special bond by watching the new series and she said I had this weird look on my face that she had never seen before. 

I like others watched it on a PBS station. We lived out in the country and then some. Mom and dad had one of those rotating antenna systems that made a weird chirping sound when it was turning the antenna on top of the house. Unfortunately I could never use the TV that was connected to it because dad had it tweaked to get all of the local stations.  

I was relegated to Saturday night in the basement, mind you a huge basement. Depending on the season it was mostly cold and really dark, even in summer it was cold most of the time. I would sleep down there and I could build a fire in the stove and heat it all up like crazy. Actually caught the chimney on fire a couple of times because I got a little over zealous. Dad wasn't pleased when that happened either. I would lay on the old hideabed that always smelled kind of musty from being in the basement. That's weird I could smell it as I was typing this. The basement was so big that there were actually two stairs going down and the couch with the bed in it was at the bottom of the stairs in the middle of the house. There is another stairs right at the back door to the house too. I liked sleeping down there even though I had my own bedroom. 

I can still remember getting excited when it was cool and clear outside on a Saturday night. I knew I could pull in the Indy PBS station and I could see an episode of Doctor Who. On some REALLY good nights I could actually get stations as far away as Chicago. On a TV in the basement that to me was pretty awesome. Now this TV was a very old 10 inch black and white TV that my parents were given for one of their anniversaries. The antenna was a set of bunny ears that you would have to move around open and close pull up and down to get the channels to come in. I remember this old TV having to use a tuning ring I think it was called to turn over and over to get the channels to tune in. Some nights it would come in right away and others it would take some real maneuvering to get what you wanted just right. One night I might get 2 or even no channels and others it would feel like dozens. 

I don't really remember much about episodes even now. I can't recall much about what I watched. I can still watch something on TV and not remember much about what happened five minutes after it is over. I do very vividly recall Tom Baker, the long long scarf, his smile and his hair. You know for years I didn't even know what colors were in the scarf. I don't recall if I even knew the TARDIS was blue. It was a special night when K9 was on. Honestly I don't to this day know who his companions were other than K9, girls were still a little icky. I put K9 into the same slot in my brain as I do Twiki, it just fascinated me to no end. Still does actually. I don't know if I even watched a complete episode before I would fall asleep and be all pissed off on the morning. 

Then I met puberty. I was on to other things... 

OPINIONS FOLLOW:  
Fast forward to the new series. Thanks to the internets I remember reading they were bring it back and the excitement. Doctor Who was coming back!! The first of the new series was horrid I hated the dumb blond and Eccleston. Then we got David Tennant and unfortunately blonde, but things were better with John and Freema. David stole it for me, he might have became my Doctor, but alas my daughter has stolen him as her own. Matt Smith is a very close second/third for me. It is a little tiring that they seem to be fighting Cybermen and Daleks' over and over. Then they shoved Capaldi in there like a sneeky Eccleston retry. Even my daughter can't stand him and we both can't wait for that to run its course and he regenerates. I would actually be stoked for a female in the role or even a season of back story starring John Hurt.

Beyond that we had books, lots of books.  8th Doctor's movie wasn't too hot in my opinion but wow the books were great. 

It's sort of like Firefly now.  Lots of people like it, feel it's a crime that it's off the air, and there's still a quiet following.  That said, Doctor Who was a multi-generational thing.  By its end you had grannies - original fans - watching it with their kids and grandkids.

Warning, unwarranted opinion from an old cranky guy to you young bucks and does out there.  Doctor Who was at its best from the Hartnell Era - the Tom Baker era.  I can mark the first story where the high water mark had left its stain and the most awesome of the awesomeness was at an end.  The Leisure Hive, Tom Baker.  From that point on, it wasn't as good as it used to be, and Tom knew it - and he quit shortly thereafter.  The stories and doctors that followed were good, just not as good.  Then the long dark between 7 and 9.  I think all the old fans were really excited to see new Doctor Who, finally.  Unfortunately, we were in for a bit of a shock.  Things had changed, and changed drastically.  Some of these changes were fine.  Some of the ideas were great.  Others though, not so much.  The whole dalek/time lord war we never saw but somehow changed the Mythos of Doctor Who.  I don't like that.  The fact that the sonic screwdriver has become a multitool that can solve any problem and do anything.  It was a screwdriver before, and rarely more than that.  Also we have at least two very young, very uncharacteristic doctors who seem to be everyone's favorites (10 and 11).  Worst of all perhaps, we had really impossibly epic conclusions where the entire multiverse/universe etc was going to hell in a handbasket and suddenly ""cause I'm the doctor"" he makes it all go away.  It's foolishness.  The Doctor is becoming a godlike being, and that just wasn't the Doctor before.  He just outsmarted his enemies of old.  I feel like it's become a very, very different show now, and it just doesn't feel like Doctor Who as much to me.  Capaldi changes this a little, and I have hope for him.

Can you hear yourself? Firstly, it's Liverpool fans downvoting you. I also want to point out nobody at any point called you anti-Semitic. 

History or fan base has absolutely no bearing on how good a team is right now (look at inter and AC). That said, Spurs absolutely have achieved great things in football. Remember you are comparing them to the second most successful team in English football history. 2 league titles, 8 FA cups, 2 uefa cups and 5 league cups (and that's just the pick of many trophies) is plenty of silverware and history if you ask me. By your judgement no team has 'history' if it hasn't won a boat load of trophies. So Liverpool, United and Arsenal are the only ones to have contributed to English football and the rest are all cunts with no ""history""? This is what you are implying. If anyone is having delusions of grandeur or are being ""uppity"" it is you you poor soul. I don't know if you noticed but Liverpool have won about as much as Spurs have in the last decade.

I'm not majorly concerned either way, the biggest problem with QPR was disciplined deep defending. Neither Arsenal nor United have stellar defensive records this season (neither do QPR obviously but they definitely played well) and they'll be looking to gain points themselves.

Secondly, many people killed on the roads are killed due to non-head injuries, where helmets won't make a jot of different.

Thirdly, there's also some evidence that drivers are more cautious around cyclists without helmets (e.g. Giving more room when overtaking) and cyclists cycle more cautiously, both of which reduce the chances of having an accident in the first place.

null,false,Buffaluffasaurus,null,null,null,"Of course I understand it's a fairly normal tactic to play attacking fullbacks.  I don't have a problem with it as a tactic, I have a problem when a player such as Rose was more of a liability than a strength in that role.  That may have changed in his performances in recent weeks, but it was a fairly common occurrence throughout the last two seasons to see him be directly or indirectly responsible for more goals conceded than scored.  That's not a problem with some overarching philosophy in modern football... it's a problem with a particular player in a particular role.

And besides, not all top teams play with two simultaneously attacking fullbacks.  It's actually arguable that you can have better balance by playing one of each.  Chelsea, for instance, play Ivanovic in a fairly maurading role (and yet I'd argue he's still good enough to not neglect defensive responsibilities), but possess possibly the best fullback in the entire league in Azipilicueta, who is hardly known for his goal threat.  Plus they have the league's best CDM in Matic, whereas we play pretty much without one, at least in a traditional sense.

Poch is not a bad coach, but jury's out on whether he's a particularly good one.  His first season is no better or worse than AVB's first in charge, and look how that turned out.

null,false,yerjam,,Craigavon,null,"Right this might be bullshit but I read it in a little book that came with, I think the Belfast Telegraph a few years ago about strange non-paramilitary related murders in Northern Ireland. I read it a while back so I mightn't get the details right. It concerns a murder that happened in the Holylands in I think the 1980s:

So it's summer and most of the students have gone home leaving the Holylands mostly empty. This left the area as easy pickings for burglars and the like. So our culprit came into the area, found an empty house and broke in, only he didn't steal anything. He left the front door unlocked and went out on the town. The book mentioned that this wasn't an uncommon thing to do, knowing the houses were empty plenty of local teenagers used to do this so they could drink and get drunk out on the town and have somewhere to stay,  away from the prying eyes of their parents. 

Anyway, the culprit pulled a girl while he was out and brought her back to the broken into house, pretending he lived there. Once inside, the culprit started to rape and beat the girl, pretty badly. He beat her with a variety of objects he found in the house; golf clubs, a hammer and bizarrely, a telephone. Eventually he beat her to death. The injuries to the girl were mainly on the face and were so bad I believe she could only be identified via dental records. Not long after murdering the girl the culprit fled in such a rush he left the front door unlocked.

Some time after a burglar broke into the house and while searching for valuables he found the girl's decomposing corpse in the bedroom where the culprit had left her. Upon discovering her he left the scene and anonymously called the police to report what he'd saw. When the police arrived at the scene they believed the girl to have been dead for a number of weeks before the burglar found her. 

I'm not sure if they ever caught the fella, I can't remember unfortunately. Maybe if someone else remembers this crime they can chime in.

I think schools which spend more time teaching children about morality (which is basically what religious services and sermons are for) are more likely to get superior moral results. I also think that having an underlying enforcer of morality in the form of a deity helps keep many people in line until such a point that their understanding of religion can develop to the point it becomes unnecessary. I also believe that religious schools have attributes and activities that give their students an advantage over other schools; the likes of choir, bible study and church events all provide networking and transferable skills that many would otherwise not get. That might seem trivial to you, but there are lots of successful people who attribute their success to their early church activities.

As to the Lords point you seem to have decided you wanted to make a point irrespective of what I actually said, making it silly and you unable to understand it. If you actually bothered to read what I said rather than your made up version, you would realise my point is entirely different.

Religious people have a way of talking and phrasing things which sounds different from other people. They are influential community leaders, tend to be educated and articulate, and make a proactive point of talking about morality and church initiatives. They are not the only ones with morals, but they are the ones that can contribute those things. This tends to be good and positive, I have read numerous House of Lords speeches where their interventions have been useful, effective drivers of consideration and discussion. In short, things that make good peers of the realm.

To;DR just because you can live a good, moral life without religion, have good schools that are not religious, and good peers without them being bishops does not mean that having a religious undertone to morality does not help people, that religious schools can have superior attributes to their secular counterparts or that the Bishops are not better peers than most.

&gt; http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/general-election-2015/11511944/David-Cameron-should-not-be-afraid-to-talk-about-food-banks.html

&gt;If a charge sheet were to be written against David Cameron, listing the social ills that have crept in over the past five years, food banks would be placed at the top. Everyone from Ed Miliband to the Archbishop of Canterbury seems to regard their very existence as an outrage, giving the lie to Mr Cameron’s talk of an economic recovery. If Britain is prosperous, runs the argument, why has the number of food banks quadrupled? What kind of society cuts tax for the richest, while those at the bottom are forced to queue in church halls for the very basics?

&gt;Jeremy Paxman went a stage further last week: did the Prime Minister actually know how many food banks there are? He didn’t – proof, to his critics, that he didn’t care much either. The Scottish National Party has been using food banks to prove that Britain, as a country, does not work any more. Alex Salmond talks about them as a disease spread from Westminster. After independence, say the placards, “the only banks we will lose are food banks”. And now Labour is promising that they will be a casualty of Ed Miliband’s government.

&gt;Three million people work but are still poor. What are the Tories doing for them?Poverty has been redefined to the point of meaninglessness. Soaking the rich won’t cut poverty or inequality

&gt;Had Iain Duncan Smith foreseen any of this five years ago, he might have reacted differently when he was approached by two Tory backbenchers with a bright idea. Robert Halfon and John Glen were struck by the growth of food banks under Labour, even though the last government barely acknowledged their existence. They helped people who fell between the cracks of a notoriously unreliable welfare system. If benefits payments were late, or if there was a delay while a claim was being processed, food banks offered the basics to those in genuine need. It struck them as a great idea, deserving of the government’s support.

&gt;This met with much resistance from officials in the Department for Work and Pensions; they saw this as a question of control. And of reputation. The fact that food bank usage had risen tenfold under Labour was a sign of the welfare state’s failures: why help draw attention to this? To Duncan Smith, this argument cut straight to the heart of why the Conservatives were in government: to change the way things worked, to acknowledge that the government machine doesn’t get everything right. If charities are providing a much-needed service to vulnerable people, he asked, don’t they deserve support?

&gt;So under David Cameron, food banks became part of the welfare state. There was no attempt to nationalise them; their food comes from voluntary donations, the work done by charities. But Jobcentres would stock their pamphlets, and mention them to people who might need them. Councils were then given power over handing out welfare “crisis loans” for emergency support. So from Bolton to Southend, applicants were referred to food banks before cash was handed out. It was all seen, back then, as the Big Society in action – a perfect example of government, charities and communities working together.

&gt;Now, Mr Duncan Smith must bitterly regret lifting a finger to help food banks. The project has grown faster than he, or anyone else, anticipated. The Trussell Trust, the largest food bank chain, has 430 centres and wants to open in every town in the land. But even it has started to beat up on the Government, saying the demand for food is being fuelled by welfare reform. So out of nowhere, Mr Cameron has started facing an accusation that he will hear time and time again: that the explosion of food banks can only be explained by the explosion of poverty.

&gt;Given how much we’re likely to hear about food banks, it is probably worth Mr Cameron’s time explaining the situation. Yes, food banks are there because people need to eat – but it’s not as simple as poverty. Surveys since the crash have shown no real increase in people unable to afford food. Just one in five food bank customers mentions low income, and one in six cites changes to benefits. There are heavily indebted families, abused women seeking shelter or people who have suddenly lost an income. There are people like David Greenhill, a former Rolls-Royce engineer who lost his job when diagnosed with osteoarthritis and then lost his benefits when wrongly judged fit to work. His benefits were reinstated. But in the interim, he relied upon food banks.

&gt;Britain’s welfare state still has more “clients” than Ireland has people. It is a vast bureaucracy, making tens of thousands of assessments of tens of thousands of lives each week. Delays and mistakes are inevitable, and who helps those on the wrong end of these mistakes? Food banks are not an alternative to welfare: the Trussell Trust only ever offers three vouchers for food parcels. Only in exceptional circumstances is help offered for longer. The question is not why food banks exist; the question is what such people did before they existed.

&gt;The “Big Society” was an awful name given to a good idea. Food banks embody the way in which charities and communities can come together, to help people failed by government. Food banks have been growing the world over, including in Germany, which has one of the most generous welfare systems in the world. All of this does present governments with a challenge: what do you do, if charities start coming up with popular welfare solutions? Fight them – or help them?

&gt;In politics, no good deed goes unpunished. When it comes to winning elections, Labour’s cold approach worked; no one taunted Gordon Brown about the tenfold rise in food banks. Even now, Labour’s pledge that food banks “can never be allowed to become a permanent feature of British society” sounds as if the party has a steely commitment to social justice. But consider the implications of the threat: would it be possible, let alone compassionate, to stop church halls offering help to people who need 

&gt;Food banks started to grow in Britain long before the crash, and they will be with us long after the recovery. Prosperity will not make them disappear, just as poverty did not make them arrive. If anything, as a country becomes wealthier, people think of ever-better ways to help. For example, in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, a “social supermarket” has opened, selling food at greatly reduced prices to locals who are judged to be in need. Unlike food banks, these supermarkets serve customers as often as they like. Another has opened in Lambeth, South London, and both are hugely popular. Ought they to be lambasted, as signs of social decay? Or saluted, as a successful community-driven social enterprise?

&gt;The Prime Minister should not be afraid of talking about this, because it raises a question that sits at the heart of this general election. Food banks will always be with us, because there will always be people who need help faster than government can provide it. If charities are willing and able to offer help, how should government respond? Labour sees them as impostors, and wants them extinguished. The Tories view them as friends, and offer help. Here is the difference between Miliband’s socialism and Cameron’s conservatism.

&gt;Food banks highlight a solution, rather than a problem. They have helped hundreds of thousands of people who were not being helped before. They show the shape of welfare to come – where government works with communities and volunteer groups to take help to where it’s most needed. Mr Cameron may not want to admit it, but they do underline a point he made almost 10 years ago: that there is such a thing as society – it’s just not the same thing as

So let's take women's rights as an example: as a man, would I like it if I were discriminated against because of my gender like women are/have been? No - so I'll try not to do it myself.

null,false,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,null," I think this has three components, two of which I can't see being addressed so far:

a. Erosion of lunch breaks:

I don't actually know what my employment contract would currently say, if I had one, but when I started I had a 42 hour per week contract with one hour per day paid lunch. Lunch has been eroded for nearly everyone I know to snarfling a sandwich at their desk.

b. There is much less local work. 

Nearly all large employers have consolidated their premises. This means your working day, if you factor travel, is likely to be significantly extended. It also (I think) makes it more likely to hang around until something is finished.

c. Expectation creep:

I think this is the big one, actually. The has always been someone willing to do a little more, or put in a little more time, or go the extra mile. In the past that would be rewarded with a raise or a promotion.

Pay progression pretty much died long before the financial crisis. Then expectations crept. Instead of Bill who put out 20% more widgets getting a promotion or a pay rise employers started looking at their other employees and asking why they weren't working as hard as Bill. Instead of working hard to progress it became a treadmill to avoid being last.

Possibly the clearest embodiment of this attitude was stack ranking; famously introduced by GE in the eighties. This was sometimes described as Rank And Yank; literally a mechanism where employees ranked and those rated lowest disposed of.

The public sector now uses essentially this model with staff literally told that it is not sufficient to merely do their job well. Companies like Microsoft abandoned it because they discovered that (and this shouldn't come as much of a surprise) it led to internecine conflict between staff, whose best interest was no longer to cooperate.",null,0,null,1428908453,null,0,false,0,cqaluip,null,t3_32bpf9,null,t1_cqaluip,null,t3_32bpf9,null,null,null,1432360537,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

My grandmother on my mother's side was afraid of... well, everything: being burgled, the local kids, etc. She admittedly lived in a moderately-rough neighbourhood of a North-Eastern town, but it was honestly nowhere near as bad as she feared. In any case, she'd... *acquired* herself a couple of weapons, including a revolver and ammunition.

Sick of kids climbing her fence to get their balls, frisbees etc. out of her garden (the particular position of her house meant that more landed there than anywhere else in the estate), she invited into her house one of the smaller but more-gossipy little ones and showed him her guns, how she loaded them, etc., and then sent him back out to tell of his friends about the crazy old lady with the firearms who didn't like people coming into her garden. From then on, kids *really* steered clear of the place, and my grandmother would go out into the garden a few times a year and fling back over the fences and into the street outside the dozens of balls that were invariably piling-up in her yard, by the point. Meanwhile, the children outside would argue about which ones were theirs based on their hazy memories of football games played the previous summer.

When I heard about this, one summer, while overhearing some children playing cricket in the street (""don't play there - the woman in that house doesn't like the balls hitting her fence, and she's got a gun!""), I told my mother and my grandma about the reputation that she had. My mother asked if she *did* have a gun (because damnit, we weren't entirely comfortable with the idea) and she showed us that what she had was a starting pistol (turns out that she *also* had a starting pistol).

It was only after she died that we discovered her *real* gun. Also a collection of knives clearly designed for combat and a makeshift spiked mace. We turned in the firearms to the police station, naturally, thereby helping to remove the *real* threat to life from my grandmother's town by far more than she thought she was by owning them in the first place. Because honestly: a slightly batty old lady with a pistol is not something you want to tangle with, I'm sure.

null,false,suzych,null,null,null,"""Just"" a companion?  Well, yes -- the companion he desperately needs to get back on his feet, and -- at last! -- a person with a life of her own, goals of her own, and faults of her own.  With Smith she was an empty outline, moved around as the plot required, a weird cross between pre-destined slave, an animated piece of purpose-built property (being ""born to save the Doctor"", as your shoes are born to keep you from cutting your feet when you walk around outside).  

In Season 8, she turned into a person.  Season 8 was all about why the Doctor absolutely could not walk away from her, try as he might (for her sake, not his own).  He needs her as his teacher, taking cues from her, a human being to teach him everything he'd learned  about human relationships before his very fast and brutal regeneration from Matt Smith.  She needs him to give her life range and significance, thrills and wonders.

So they're ""casual acquaintances"" now?  As in, ""Do you think I care for you so little that betraying me would make a difference?""  Really?  Not to mention, ""You look at me and you don't see me.  Do you have any idea what that's like?""  Mmmm, yep, casual, she doesn't matter a bit to him.  Or, ""Clara Oswald, you'll never look any different to me.""  As in, the touch-phobic Doctor recoils from the man who pushes rudely past him on the train -- but Clara can take his arm and hug herself close to his side, because he loves her and she's said she's going to leave after their ""last hoorah"".

But she's rejected him multiple times, for being ""old"" looking, for being colder and scarier than Matt Smith, for being manipulative and deceptive in his drive to keep her with him; so he's pulled back from the romantic relationship that went with his previous life because he doesn't want to drive her away -- she's already skittish about staying, attracted, scared, toying with the idea of an ordinary life with Danny -- no, I think fucking is definitely off the table here, which leaves space for developing the actual love between them, which is much more interesting and flexible.  There may indeed be some random nitwits around, but neither Clara nor the Doctor is one of them.",null,0,null,1428911311,null,0,false,0,cqaml44,null,t3_326scr,null,t1_cqaml44,null,t1_cq8u4kr,null,null,null,1432360885,null,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3,null

Generally speaking, the rule of thumb is that for a ""comfortable retirement"" you should be saving half of your age as a percentage of your income, based on the age you started saving.

So, a 20 year old should save 10% of their income for the rest of their lives, but a 40 year old with no prior savings should save 20% of their income for the rest of *their* lives. This illustrates the power of compound returns.

That doesn't necessarily mean in a pension; it could be achieved in any long-term arrangement.

Have a read through [the £x section of the FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpersonalfinance/wiki/lumpsuminvestment). There is a comparison of pensions and ISAs for long-term savings.

null,false,TheAntiqueTraveller,null,null,null,"The bar is actually higher than most people think. But let's use an extreme example to show why this law exists: 

You own an open area brown field site near some flats. You don't put a fence up but anyone walking over it is technically a trespasser. You own a bear trap business and decide to store you spare stock on this land, but let it become overgrown. A pedestrian takes a short cut and injures themselves. 

Hopefully this example is extreme enough for anyone but the most rabid Daily Mail reader to agree that the landowner was in the wrong more than the pedestrian? The law recognises this per the above law. 

Now let's say you see the risk and erect a small white picket fence and a sign that says ""private"". That should stop pedestrians but what about kids playing and kicking a ball in? Are we really to be so strict that they can't claim? Isn't the landowner still really in the wrong?

Or you build a better fence but decide to diversify your business - you forgot to account for the lack of bears in the UK so the bear trap business isn't doing great. So you decide to move into the kid's slides business! You store you stock on the same land... even with this better fence can't we all see what will happen?! 

The point is if you want to store bear traps and kid's slides in the same place you need a high fence that no kids can see through to see the slides, razor wire, massive signs saying ""bear traps!"" and maybe a security guard to look over the place. 

The point of this law is *not* to catch people who have a loose paving slab, or someone stumbling on a tuft of grass. It is there to make sure we don't have kids sliding into bear traps. That is why this is an important law and the blanket approach of ""my land your risk"" isn't fair.

null,false,twersx,null,null,null,"historically, Grammar Schools were there to teach Latin. Over time the curriculum broadened until they were there to provide a general secondary education.

""Comprehensive"" refers to the fact that those schools did not discriminate against entrants for wealth or ability. 

In the 20th Century we had a system called the Tripartite system. At the equivalent of today's Year 6, all students would take an exam and based on that exam they would go to a ""modern"" school, a ""technical"" school or a grammar school. The intention wasn't to purely segregate people by ability, Grammar schools weren't supposed to be ""better"" than the alternatives. Instead, Grammar schools would teach more academic subjects like complex maths, latin, classics etc. while the other two types of school would focus on practical skills (Modern schools) and scientific subjects like chemistry and engineering (technical schools)

It was initially praised by almost everyone as it meant that poor people with ability could attend Grammar schools and therefore the new system would lead to increased social mobility. However, technical schools were not well developed which meant that people tended to go to either a Grammar school or a modern school. On top of that, Grammar schools received the majority of education funds.  There was fear, especially from Labour politicians, that Grammar schools were fostering even more inequality, as you'd have a huge adult population that was significantly less educated than those who attended Grammar schools. 

The comprehensive was devised and intended to provide a grammar school level of education to everyone. However as you might be able to tell when you have the smartest and quickest kids being taught in the same classes as the slowest kids who struggle the most, standards are going to be extremely difficult to maintain. 

Today, a comprehensive is the same as it always was in most cases, they will admit near anyone without requiring an entrance exam or fees etc. Grammar schools tend to be selective and many require you to pay fees (or qualify for a scholarship/bursary). A lot of things are associated with Grammar schools more than comprehensives; teaching of Latin, visiting music teachers, school Cadet forces, etc.",null,0,null,1428912324,null,0,false,0,cqamtnu,null,t3_32e3az,null,t1_cqamtnu,null,t3_32e3az,null,null,null,1432360997,null,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3,null

[Look at the UKRC stipend.](http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/media/news/rcuk-doctoral-stipend-levels-and-indicative-fees-for-2014/) This is what the ESPRC and BBSRC use so it's what most PhD's will be getting paid.

So you get £14k (tax-free) p.a. for 3.5 years to carry out extremely challenging work under very stressful conditions. (Most people take 4 years to finish so live off savings for 6 months and work weekends and long hours in an attempt to keep it to 6 months).

If you are in London you get a bit more than £14k probably, but it just goes straight to your landlord and some of the CDT's might pay the princely sum of £16k or so.

And finally after that gruelling experience you might be lucky enough to get a post-doc where you could well end up on the same take-home pay as now you pay tax. And the contract is only 1-3 years.

Maybe after several of those you will get a faculty position. Maybe. Or maybe you will have to leave science and all the specialised knowledge you spent years obtaining is pretty worthless in most commercial work (the transferable skills you can get from a Masters).

I did Physics, my (hypothetical) children will do CS and I wouldn't advise anyone to go into science as a career.

I don't think most people have any idea how broken science is due to lack of funding. [This was written in 1999 pertaining to Physics](http://physics.wustl.edu/katz/scientist.html) and it's only gotten worse since then.

null,false,SpecialPudding,null,null,null,"Hi, Do you know if they stopped your housing benefit at all when you changed to PIP? It's very important to keep housing benefit updated with all of your changes in circumstances.

 If you are on housing benefit and other benefits stop or change, it can sometimes cause hosing benefit to stop unexpectedly - for example if your DLA claim was stopped for a while, your housing benefit claim may be stopped due to a change in circumstances, then restarted.

This can be tricky because you don't always realize straight away and your arrears can mount up. If this is the case, you can write to your housing benefit department at the council and ask them to look at your ""underlying entitlement""  - you will need to provide proof of your income during the time housing benefit was stopped - paper copies of your bank account will be fine. If it is the case that you where entitled to housing benefit during this time, it's POSSIBLE that the council will pay what you were due. 

Someone at the CAB would be able to help you to do this. Chat with Shelter as well, they are amazing. As soon as you know whats going on and why, let your landlord know in writing, and keep a copy of the letter. If it comes to getting evicted and your landlord takes you to court to do this, you have a better chance of the courts going easy on you if you can prove you're trying your best to sort it out.

Crisis loans no longer really exist, you can apply for a budgeting loan from the job centre, but you need to be receiving income related benefits (eg JSA, ESA etc) for over 26 weeks and you will pay it back out of those benefits within 104 weeks. I would explore the possibility of your underlying entitlement first before going down that route, and AVOID pay day loans at all costs - it will make life a LOT worse!

It sounds like your in a tricky spot. I second the advice for stepchange, they may be able to help with your phones and any other debts so you don't gather more charges.

If they aren't making you more than 200k a year, you cut their pay or cut their job. It's not sustainable to pay somebody if they aren't making you money. 

If you are earning 200k a year and not working hard enough to generate a profit, you won't keep the job long unless you're working at dad's company. there are a lot of people willing to work extremely hard and get that sort of money, so why would they prolong your employment if there are other potential employees that are better investments?

The view of board room execs who spend very little time working and let the grunts down below do the charlie work of the law firm or investment bank is a little more grounded, but the only reason they are there in the first place (in all likelihood) is because they were worked to the bone earlier on. To become partner at a prestigious law firm, you have to work insanely hard. Once you're there, not so much, but it's still a hard graft. A relative of mine is working at an extremely prestigious law firm and in his first two years he has worked 10 hour days almost every day of the week. He's had holidays cancelled last minute because something came up. He's probably not going to have the opportunity to make partner for over 12 years, during which he is going to have to work even harder and even smarter because there's going to be a couple of spots and a horde of associates all over the world who want to be partner more than almost anything else.

Yes, there are people who work extremely hard who don't get that sort of pay but that's largely due to the industry they work in.

&gt; 3\. Any particular estate agents you'd recommend/avoid? We're just looking to rent somewhere but don't want to get shafted – plenty of horror stories here in the capital about Foxtons...

I've had some particularly bad experiences with Oulsnams and Greens, to the point where I won't look at a place offered by them. YMMV.

&gt; 4\. Anything else I should be thinking about which might not have occurred to me? Someone I chatted to who's already made the same move pointed out that most estate agents in Brum will assume you have a car, which we don't – anything else like that?

Most *people* will assume you have a car, generally. The majority of Brum is suburbia rather than dense housing, so having space to park a car where you live is the norm, unless you live right in the city centre.

However, not having one is definitely no hindrance - Brum has a great bus network as well as some very good cycle links (if you're looking at Edgbaston, much of the Bristol Road and Pershore Road have cycle path coverage, and cycling is actively encouraged on the canal towpaths which have had some great resurfacing work completed recently).

I'd personally shy away from Kings Heath - the traffic can be horrific - but if you're after some green space then Moseley/Edgbaston sounds a good bet given the proximity to Canon Hill Park as well as the city centre.

I imagine the /r/brum meetups are considerably quieter affairs than the London ones!

However;

It's all relative and the fact is that 2015 has so far been a failure on every level. The football has often been dreadful and the players have looked uninspired. We have exited the Champion's League and the FA Cup with a whimper whilst dropping out of the title race just when we should have been kicking into gear. The fact that this squad is facing a straight fight to finish fourth is a damning indictment of a manager who appears to be at the end of the road. 

The players should be meeting much more criticism than they are, but they look like strangers a lot of the time and that is a failure of management.

I would disagree about this. Sure, there's a lot of moralistic stuff in the Bible but there's also just stuff about the story and there's stuff regarding unnecessary morals (i.e., how you should love/trust God or not make objects in his image). 

&gt;I also think that having an underlying enforcer of morality in the form of a deity helps keep many people in line until such a point that their understanding of religion can develop to the point it becomes unnecessary.

This is like, horrible in my opinion. You think it's work indoctrinating your child into a worldview you don't believe in just because it might make them more likely to follow moral guidance? To me, this is borderline amoral. I wouldn't send my child to be taught what I consider a gross misunderstanding of the Universe just because (and in fact exactly NOT because) there's a scary God who'll they'll fear and become obedient. Sure, maybe they'll ""grow out of it"", but maybe they won't. 

 &gt;As to the Lords point you seem to have decided you wanted to make a point irrespective of what I actually said, making it silly and you unable to understand it. If you actually bothered to read what I said rather than your made up version, you would realise my point is entirely different.

Well, you said:

&gt;Bishops in the Lords; religion and morality is important in general life [...]

which to me implied that Bishops are the people who fill this ""moralistic"" role. 

But I don't know. Maybe Bishops are good peers but I just don't know. I would definitely rather have them replaced with peers just as good who aren't religious, but whatever.

Paying what you can afford and saving up is fiscally responsible - what you're doing is (generally) a good thing.

There's no such thing as a universal credit score.  Different lenders will look at different factors to decide whether they want to lend to you.  If you've never borrowed a small sum of money, people may be wary of giving you a larger sum of money.

So, to answer your questions....

1) It depends!  Register for a free credit report from https://www.noddle.co.uk/ - you'll get an idea of what lenders see about you.

2) Apply for a credit card.  Make sure you PAY IT OFF IN FULL EVERY MONTH.  Do *not* be tempted to spend the full credit limit on it! As others have said, a mobile phone contract can also help - as long as you don't forget to pay your bills.

3) If you're buying, say, a fridge - look to see if you can pay for it in (interest free) instalments.

If lenders can see that you're reliable and haven't missed any payments, you'll (probably) get a better credit score.

Personally, I think he should be fired.

I'm not in favor of switching managers all too often, nobody is really, and I'm all in favor of giving them time to build - as long as they're showing potential and good signs. I definitely think LVG, Poch and Rodgers should be getting more time, for example. But Pellegrini is just an amazingly mediocre coach in my opinion - and I said that last year too when they won the title. I don't think Man City will go to far with him.

I think they need to find their Mourinho/Guardiola, and I'm sure Pellegrini is not the guy. Here's my assessment of him:

Pros:

-Attacking football - his team are generally attacking and score a lot.

-Quiet dressing room atmosphere/positive press.

However, here's my case against him:

-Constant big game underperformer - losing both title showdowns last year (Chelsea and Liverpool), knocked out by Barcelona so easily, outplayed by Bayern last year (in the game where they actually cared), there are so many examples.

Even in Madrid, he lost the title because he lost both Classicos (Barcelona wasn't as naive as Chelsea/Liverpool and dropped the points back to him).

-Completely tactically inept. Going up with 4-4-2 against Barcelona this year was laughable. It seems to me like almost every major tactical change he makes is quite misguided. Even Wenger has out-tacticed him this year.

-Lack of leadership/motivation issues - players are having fun under Pellegrini, but they're not fighting for him. I don't see players sacrificing themselves for him, like Mourinho for example. They seem to enjoy it while it's going well, but once things go wrong, their mentality is awful. I don't buy the 'all the players are at fault here because they don't give a shit'. It's the manager's job to motivate them. You almost never saw a Ferguson or Mourinho player not giving a shit.

-Lack of discpline/defensive issues - starts from the wingers not tracking back, Yaya Toure not defending, awful defending from the defenders, I feel the whole defensive shape is just off. It's been like this in Madrid too. Usually it's enough against the smaller teams, but it gets exploited again and again by the bigger ones.

-Lack of decisiveness in brave decisions - basically the fact that Kompany and Toure are still sure starters, means Pellegrini either don't watch the game or afraid to make big decisions against his stars.

-Short term thinking, lack of belief in youth - 0 youth players promoted in 2 years, instead prefers to use players out of position (Milner as striker, etc), buys short gap players to fill position instead of youth (Lampard, Sanga).


-Bad transfers - obviously Txiki share the blame, but some of those are clearly Pellegrini players. Their transfer deals in the last 3 years were awful.


I think that's it. I said all this last year too, they got lucky that both Chelsea and Liverpool bottled the title, but his flaws were very clear. I think as long as Man City don't find a real top coach, they won't have a great team.",null,0,null,1428917599,null,0,false,0,cqanxno,null,t3_32cmpu,null,t1_cqanxno,null,t3_32cmpu,null,null,null,1432361520,null,1,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,1,null

1. UKIP does not believe in shutting the door to migration. The current policy is more racist as it discriminates against places like India and New Zealand as we need to regulate the immigration from there more to make up for our open borders to the EU. UKIP would use a points system that places emphasis on speaking the language and having a skill set that we need. Immigration has positives and negatives and we would lose the negatives with this system.
2. UKIP are one of the most open parties to asylum seekers, we believe it is British tradition and were one of the first to campaign to take in asylum seekers from Syria.
3. UKIP does not believe in privatising the NHS in anyway. We plan to assist hospitals in paying off PFI and plan to enlist more nurses and doctors by saving in middle management so the NHS can do its job. The current NHS looks a bit like the hospital episode in Yes Minister.

On a more serious note, just based on my own ponderings:

1. How would we even know? We've only been sending probes to other planets for a few decades, whereas we've been measuring the Earth's temperatures for at least a couple of centuries, and have climate data from ice cores, lake-bed sediment cores, and tree ring data that give us data to analyse temperatures going back a few thousand/tens of thousands of years - means of measurement we do not have for other planets, for obvious reasons. So how would we eve compare other planets to our own?

2. Why would we measure other planets to compare to Earth when we could just measure the output of the sun directly? Other planets could have other effects such as increased volcanic activity, elipitcal orbits and orbits that last much longer than Earth years that mean that any influence from the sun is dampened/confused by other factors that aren't the sun. Mars could be warming while Venus is cooling, Uranus could be closer to the sun as part of its normal orbit than it was 30 years ago (I dunno, these are just ideas) that would mean, obviously, that it'd be warmer than 30 years ago, not through any change to the sun's output but just because of its regular orbit. So if the sun was getting hotter, wouldn't we ignore the impact on other planets and actually just measure the sun's output? We can do that; the technology exists and is sufficiently advanced that it can measure the sun even at night, through the centre of the Earth. So why would ""other planets are warming"" be the argument instead of, simply, ""the sun is getting hotter"" - if indeed that was the case.",null,0,null,1428918592,null,0,false,0,cqao56j,null,t3_32c4bo,null,t1_cqao56j,null,t1_cqalocc,null,null,null,1432361619,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

&gt;Aston Villa Review: Episode 116 - Villa defeat Tottenham Hotspur and set course for Wembley
It didn't start brilliantly but the past week came up roses for Aston Villa. A 3-3 draw against Queens Park Rangers at home demonstrated both the fragility of Villa's makeshift defence and the extraordinary quality of striker Christian Benteke, whose hat-trick highlighted an otherwise disappointing night.

&gt;No matter, though, because Villa got their unexpected win. Benteke was on the scoresheet again as Villa won 1-0 away at Tottenham Hotspur, leaving Tim Sherwood's side on 32 points with five games to play. In this week's show Chris and Steve examine those two matches and Villa's four-point return and, of course, look ahead to this Sunday's FA Cup Semi-Final against Liverpool",null,0,null,1428919545,null,0,false,0,cqaoc5y,null,t3_32fdd9,null,t1_cqaoc5y,null,t3_32fdd9,null,null,null,1432361710,null,2,false,avfc,t5_2s569,2,null

Well, the ban on the Grand National would be one example... That should cover their ideal of animal welfare as well as the means. Of course I believe, as most people do, that animals need to be treated with respect and not tortured etc. But proposing to ban a race isn't really a sensible way of achieving the 'higher standard' of welfare the Greens advocate. It would be smarter to reform the length of the track and the height of the hurdles. The only reason they want to ban it outright is because of a sense of self-righteousness and a relatively heavy moralistic approach. Another example would be in the corporation and stakeholder submission. 

Of course you're also right that my complaints, at the most abstract level, could be levied on each and every political party. I frequently use that as an argument *against* Green party moralisation myself. 

But what I said stands: I find the Greens (like UKIP) rhetoric particularly distasteful in its attempt at shaming people or certain groups for having other more nuanced beliefs -- beliefs which the vast majority share as being good get shamed because they aren't as extreme as those the Greens advocate. This in conjunction with the practical and occasional ideological absurdity of their proposals really puts me off.

I work as a software developer. I can complete the other two years of the course (or x credits, over however many years) at any point in the next 13 years or so without having to start over, so I can return to it easily if I decide it's worth it.

I would honestly just get stuck in and teach yourself, build some toy projects for your own enjoyment and see where it takes you. That's how I got my start.

&gt;austerity

Is a word, not a policy. Labour and Tory policy in the area of reducing the deficit is very different. Labour will borrow for infrastructure, the Tories won't. Labour are not promising a precise timetable, the Tories are (even though they've shown such a timetable to be useless in this Parliament)

&gt;inequality

Are you kidding me? Cracking down on tax avoidance, raising taxes on property and high incomes, lowering VAT, introducing apprenticeships for half of all school leavers, raising the minimum wage, encouraging the living wage and cutting business rates vs. raising VAT, lowering taxes, for high earners, restricting trade union activity and pretending inequality isn't happening/doesn't matter/is someone else's fault?

&gt;Neither will actively work to create democratic electoral system.

Labour will introduce an elected House of Lords, just as Labour abolished the hereditary principle in the House of Lords. The Tories blocked an elected house of Lords just a couple of years ago.

&gt;Both will continue to blame immigration and the poor for the recession.

Ed Balls was on the TV this morning pointing out that the recession happened because of a crash in the US mortgage market. Actually, this particular accusation can't be levelled at either side, because the Tories blame Labour and public borrowing, not 'immigration and the poor'. Labour also have very different policies on immigration, which link strongly into their policies on inequality. The aim is to prevent exploitation, not immigration.

&gt;NHS

The NHS won't be privatised if people don't want it to be. Private services offering some treatments isn't the same as privatisation.

its like looking at the lottery by gender and seeing men spend 10 as much as women on tickets (hypothetically) and claiming the lottery is sexist because most winners are men, and then deeming the lottery oppressive to women because they are under represented in the winners, while completely ignoring the fact that men invest ten times the amount and hence lose x10 the amount when they don't win and statistically there are more losers than winners.

&gt;The Green Party will end the exploitation of animals in horse racing, greyhound racing and all  situations where animals are commercially raced. There would be an immediate ban on the use of the whip in horse racing and in jumps racing, and on the use of a non-linear track in greyhound racing. A single regulatory authority would be put in place for each sport, tasked with establishing and enforcing strict welfare standards. There would be a requirement for full traceability of all animals involved in racing  throughout their lives (using microchip technology where applicable) and full publication of injury and  death statistics. These statistics would be used as evidence to close dangerous tracks and ban trainers with poor records. Breeding and import of animals for racing will be tightly regulated and monitored to  improve welfare and prevent over-breeding. There would be regulation on the conditions and times of  transportation of animals used in sport as well as the housing of all animals. A high level of compulsory levy  would be imposed on all betting, to be used solely for welfare improvements.
(policy number AR425)

Bennett never went as far as you or indeed the headline implies.  In truth the article does a disservice of representing the Green Party's policy on this matter. It seems that they couldn't take 5 minutes to read the official policy. It does seem that a specific race could be banned but only if it wasn't up to the standards set by this regulatory authority they propose. 

However an outright ban on horse racing is not the policy and the policy certainly isn't an arbitrary ban of a specific race. Rather it is simply to establish newer and more stringent regulations about what is allowed in the sport. 

Whether you agree with the ideas set out above or not. It is hardly the knee jerk arbitrary and outright banning that you are implying.

What's more serious is that you've signed a tenancy until 7 August when you seemingly only wanted it until June - which means that, unless she agrees to amend the lease agreement (which she definitely won't if you're refusing to pay her bullshit cleaning/gas rent increase), you will have to pay her rent until August.",null,0,null,1428920604,null,0,false,0,cqaokbc,null,t3_32dm8c,null,t1_cqaokbc,null,t1_cqa9ccg,null,null,null,1432361817,null,5,false,LegalAdviceUK,t5_32g6u,5,null

What counts as 'exploitation' of animals in horse racing? They want to enforce 'strict welfare standards' -- how do they plan on measuring that? Of course there are lines to be drawn, but ultimately it's going to be a judgement call for a human (like it already is!) and not an animal. 

Further, someone said this had nothing to do with gambling, but clearly it does as they want to tax the betting highly. So in sum they want to establish an expensive regulatory body imposing 'strict measures' on the races (implying they aren't already regulated anyway...) and to heavily tax bets. They could very well kill the race with their kindness even if they don't ban it outright. 

The fact that they 'won't rule out a ban' is the equivalent of the SNP saying they won't rule out another referendum. Of course either won't do that, because in the main it's a big part of what they respectively stand for. If they can't get reforms to the standards they decide are adequate, they will look to implement the most extreme solution, and chances are, things will never be up to their standard.

&gt; Whether you agree with the ideas set out above or not (I am assuming not as a Liberal).

It depends on how you would characterise 'the ideas set out above.' Don't you get it? The Greens will characterise it in a more extreme animal rights fashion than another party. I of course, as I've already said, believe, as do the vast majority of people, that animals should not be abused or tortured or made to suffer needlessly. I can see what they're trying to do, but since when did more bureaucracy and taxes become the best way to tackle environmental or animal rights issues?

What we know is that users go after a certain effect. When MDMA sources dried up MKAT appeared on the scene due to similar effects.

What could be done is the legalisation of poppy tea. Weak enough to give an effect but not cause overdose.

Professors Nutt and Transform have covered this area extensively. The only drugs that there seems to not be model of legalisation are crack and meth.

Roman Abramovich's personal adviser/scout is the one who seems to be unhappy, not at Vitesse but at the way things have gone for a few loanees at the club. Like Wallace and McEachran, probably. The Vitesse-Chelsea partnership will go ahead, but there'll be a change in the quality of players going there. Higher quality, from now. Mutually beneficial. Like Traore, Piazon and Kalas.
As far as the rumured partnership with Belgian club Mouscron-Péruwelz goes, you'll probably see the ""lesser quality"" kids go there. And those who can't get a work permit in other desired places will go there, as it is much easier to get work permits in Belgian football. For example, Mouscron-Péruwelz could be the place where players from South America as it is difficult for young kids from there (even without the proposed change in work permit rules) to be cleared to play in a few countries.",null,0,null,1428922504,null,0,false,0,cqaozr9,null,t3_32dptu,null,t1_cqaozr9,null,t3_32dptu,null,null,null,1432362019,null,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3,null

I'm looking at forward rates (FRAs) for GBP, in layman's terms: rates at which banks and institutions can borrow money, in *x* years' time, for *y* years. So say in your example, you're thinking of fixing your rates for 5 years, but are then unsure about what the average rate is going to be for the remaining 25 years of your mortgage, you'd be looking at 5-25 forward rate. 

Markets think:
0-5 rate (i.e. borrow now for 5 years) = 1.38%

5-30 rate (i.e. borrow in 5 years' time for 30 years, 5-25 isn't quoted) = 1.99%

5-5 rate (borrow in 5 years' time for 5 years) = 2.11%

etc. 

In general, it's forecasted that rates will not exceed 2.5% any time soon. 

Mind you, these are *institutional* rates. One, as a retail investor, you'd be paying more than an institution. The cheapest 5 year fixed mortgage is probably in the range of 3.25% for 85% LTV mortgages. More for even higher LTVs (90 or 95%).  So nearly 2% over the institutional rate. Two, you haven't really got the access to these products. You're only options now are, 2, 3, 5 and 10 year fixes, really (or trackers, but in your situation, a fixed rate mortgage seems more appropriate).

[EDIT: obviously, trackers OR fixes are available] 

Depending on what your LTV is, I'd fix for 5 or even 10 years (use moneysupermarket.com or similar to see the best available rate in your circumstances), and work off the assumption of 4.5%-5% rate afterwards.

null,false,ScheduledRelapse,null,null,null,"&gt;What counts as 'exploitation' of animals in horse racing? They want to enforce 'strict welfare standards' -- how do they plan on measuring that? Of course there are lines to be drawn, but ultimately its going to be a judgement call on a human (like it already is!) and not an animal.

You are reading a policy proposal as if it were completed legislation. If this were to ever become an actual law it would have specific standards codified into law. In fact some example of the types  standards are even mentioned in the proposal. 

Conditions and times of transportation of animals used in sport, a maximum transport time would fairly easy to set and a minimum amount of space that the horses should have during transport would be easy to set too. 

full publication of injury and death statistics. These statistics would be used as evidence to close dangerous tracks and ban trainers with poor records. - Maximum numbers of deaths per year. Once a race course exceeds the number it either has to make changes to make the course safer or close down. 

It doesn't seem the insurmountable subjective task that you are implying. You could quite easily set up measurable, enforceable standards that would improve the welfare standards of the sport. 

&gt;Further, someone said this had nothing to do with gambling, but clearly it does as they want to tax the betting highly. So in sum they want to establish an expensive regulatory body imposing 'strict measures' on the races (implying they aren't already regulated anyway...) and to heavily tax bets.

The tax is to pay for the regulatory body. 

&gt;The fact that they 'won't rule out a ban' is the equivalent of the SNP saying they won't rule out another referendum. Of course either won't do that, because in the main it's a big part of what they respectively stand for.

You are wilfully or unwillfully misinterpreting that statement by ignoring the context of the question she was answering. She was answering a question about the Grand National specifically not horse racing in general. She said they would introduce new standards and it is quite obvious that she can't rule out banning it since the standards give banning power over race course to the regulatory agency. As set out in the policy a race course that is considered dangerous by the regulatory authority could be banned. 

&gt; If they can't get reforms to the standards they decide are adequate, they will look to implement the most extreme solution, and chances are, things will never be up to their standard.

Complete hearsay based on a misinterpretation and your own bias. 

&gt;The Greens will characterise it in a more extreme animal rights fashion than another party. 

Not sure of your point here, other than the Green Party hold a different opinion than other parties. We want a diversity of ideas not an intellectual hegemony. 

&gt;I can see what they're trying to do, but since when did more bureaucracy and taxes become the best way to tackle environmental or animal rights issues?

Well the Animal Rights Act 2007 introduced a lot of new restrictions on what could be done to domestic and livestock animals. As well as introduces new types of convictions for Domestic animal abuse. Thus the bureaucracy of the courts got involved in the treatment of pets for the first time in British history. The RSPCA credit that with greatly improving animal welfare in the UK and helping them prevent animal suffering. So sometimes new restrictions and bureaucracy do indeed help.

The main benefit is that then it can be regulated. At the moment, people are shooting heroin cut with who fucking knows what. That's dangerous enough and it also makes it super easy to OD if they get stuff that's a lot purer than the garbage they're used to.

This same logic can be applied to pretty much any drug.

What people put in their own bodies is their choice and if it's cheaply available from a shop the benefits are various. Firstly, legalising reduces the stigma. Secondly, people can buy it safely. At the moment, regular, law abiding people who prefer drugs (from weed upwards) to alcohol have to associate with undesirables to get their fix. Thirdly, general safety of use. Heroin is so cheap to produce, they could basically sell pre-filled syringes or give syringes with the drug, so no dirty needles. Added to the fact that drugs would be regulated and mass produced makes use far safer.

The usual logic I hear against legalisation is the ludicrous idea that if heroin was legal, everyone would be on heroin. It's stupid and defies logic and human nature. For instance, I can go and buy as much booze as I want perfectly legally. Yet I hardly drink at all. All the people in Colorado aren't currently sat at home eating Doritos and giggling.

null,false,AnxiousMo-Fo,,Labour Member,null,"Will do when I get a chance. There's apparently only five 'new' policies in there, according to the Guardian:

&gt; **Raising the minimum wage**

&gt; Today, we are setting out the detail of that pledge: we will give the Low Pay Commission the clear task of raising the minimum wage to more than £8 by October 2019 – accelerating increases and guaranteeing the NMW increases by at least twice as much as it has under the Tories.

&gt; It will mean someone working full time on the National Minimum Wage being £800 a year better off compared to continuing with the rate of rise under the Tories.

&gt; **Rail fare freeze**

&gt; Instead of an uncosted Tory plan they have no idea how they will pay for, Labour will deliver a fully funded rail fares freeze for one year, a strict cap on every route for any future fare rises, and a new legal right for passengers will be created to access the cheapest ticket for their journey.

&gt; The cost, of just over £200 million, will be fully funded by switching spending within the existing transport budget from delaying road projects on the A27 and A358 for which the economic case is still uncertain.

&gt; **Not raising taxes**

&gt; We will not raise the basic or higher rate of Income Tax, National Insurance or VAT. Nor will we extend VAT to food, children’s clothes, books, newspapers or public transport fares. Instead, we will cut taxes for working families by bringing in a lower starting 10p rate of income tax by reversing the Tories’ Marriage Tax Allowance.

&gt; **Protecting tax credits**

&gt; Labour will protect tax credits that working families rely upon so they rise in line with inflation from next year, not cut them as the Tories plan.

&gt; **Setting up a national primary childcare service**

&gt; The Tories have let down working families by scrapping the legal requirement to provide after-school or breakfast clubs and allowing numbers to fall with only half of parents able to find suitable term-time childcare to fit with their working hours. Only 17 local authorities in England able to provide after-school clubs at all primary schools.

&gt; Today Labour is announcing a new National Primary Childcare Service, underpinning a legal right to guaranteed access to wrap-around childcare in breakfast or after-school clubs from 8am-6pm.

&gt; This will increase the amount of affordable wrap-around childcare by delivering it through CRB-vetted volunteers and using the lower overheads of primary schools. And it will increase the amount of high quality childcare by providing a route for talented people from arts, sports or music organisations to bring their skills and expertise into primary schools.

&gt; The NPCS will be a not-for-profit organisation acting as a hub to match primary schools with volunteers and a range of quality extracurricular sports, art and music activities before and after school. It will be paid for by ending Government funding for the New Schools Network, an organisation set up to promote the Free Schools programme.

In some of these cases, the policy isn't exactly 'new' but the detail is.

Firstly, how in the world do you actually make that transition? From Class-A illegal to available over the counter? Can't be over-night, not without extensive education of the population on the relative risks of each substance... We have the benefit of generations handing over the knowledge on the risks of alcohol, a substance known to have huge harm potential to health and social well-being... How are we going to replicate that level of knowledge and education for these newly legalized substances which for a lot of us will have been illegal ""because they're too dangerous""....

Secondly, how do you source a safe, stable, and ethical supply of these substances? As far as I understand it, a lot of the supply of illicit substances comes from illegal activities around the world.. e.g. Columbian/Peruvian farmers forced to grow Coca by the local gangs etc., could we knowingly support this trade? I don't think so, so we're at the point of needing ethically sourced drugs... Which will of course be more expensive than street drugs.. So there will be a black market for the cheaper option... How do we go about policing this? Seems like even if we legalize these substances we're still going to need to police the incoming/outgoing traffic for illicit substances....

On principle, I don't really have anything against the legalization argument...

If it were to be legalised we could have information prominently displayed and available in store. Enforce age restrictions and other standards at point of sale. Provide in-peron education at the same location as you buy it from. Provide the option of counselling or support for those who are in danger of being addicted at point of sale. The opportunities that legalisation opens for better drug education are almost endless. 

Legal supply will likely become cheaper than black market drugs once the legal market hits any decent amount of scale. This is beginning to happen in Colorado with Marijuana already. The price of legal Marijuana started much higher than the black market (though this was primarily due to the high tax introduced by the state) but came down over time due increased manufacturing scale and increased competition between outlets. In many areas it is already down to close to street price and it continues to trend in this direction and it is still only the first year. Once they hit scale and the professionals get more and up to speed I fully expect it to be cheaper to buy legally. 

Legalised drugs can br grown or manufactured much more efficiently instead of lots of makeshift manufacturing that gets shut down and restarted randomly you can have professional and reliable manufacture at scale.

Surely if you're going to care about anyone's feelings over him being dropped, it'd be Balotelli, and I'm fairly sure even Mario isn't dumb enough to believe he's ill just because the club say so. 

b) He's faking illness because he can't be arsed playing, and his employer who are paying him tens of thousands of pounds a week haven't cottened onto that. Despite having an entire team of doctors and medical staff who you'd at least hope would be able to spot someone pulling a sickie from someone who was genuinely ill. 

c) He's legitimately ill and it's just unfortunate.

Always tricky with a lot of mutual friends but we had a catch up at the pub after a month, before starting larger social gatherings. Still good friends and that's not something either of us want to lose, so it's very nice if disconcerting to have such an amicable split.

I had a right fuckup with work before Christmas - got offered a job, accepted, got a contract, handed my notice in, then had them renege and say they'd lost a client and now couldn't afford to take me on. The recruiter was bloody furious. But talked to bosses and we worked out a deal so that I would stay on until April, so that I could help them through some stickier projects and I'd have a safety net whilst looking for something new.

99% sure I've got the job I interviewed for on Friday, so going to arrange to get a start date in mid-June and live off my savings for a month and a half.

&gt;The __Burryman__ or __Burry Man__ is the central figure in an annual [ceremony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceremony) or ritual, the Burryman's Parade, that takes place in [South Queensferry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Queensferry), ([Gaelic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goidelic_languages) Cas Chaolais) near [Edinburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh), on the south bank of the [Firth of Forth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firth_of_Forth) in Scotland, on the second Friday of August. The custom is associated with, but separate from, the town's Ferry Fair.  The meaning of this ceremony has long been forgotten, but it has been the cause of much speculation.  It is sometimes said that the custom was first recorded in 1687 (when the right to hold the Ferry Fair was originally granted ), but it is widely believed to be much older.

It's much more likely to do with gender roles we've had from a long time ago in which men are expected to be dominant/repressive of their emotions and women submissive etc. I support feminism because I am against strong gender roles and think it has a negative effect on both genders, but lets just forget about feminism and if it's not doing enough/focusing on the wrong things; you could easily argue that the mens rights movement is even less helpful but either way its just gender wars bullcrap that gets us nowhere. 

What I think we need to do is support men being more open with their emotions and allow them to get support - possibly through supporting policies like the lib dems' mental health efforts (not voting for them, but its a good example) and removing dumb ideas about masculinity (e.g. you're less of a man for being open emotionally, submissive) by changing how we act in our own lives. idk. I'm just bored of this constantly going back to feminism and it leading nowhere.

also, someone below has already jumped to the 'biotruth' about how traditional gender roles exist with great reason, failing to understand that these expectations are likely a cause of mental health issues with men (stigma of being emotional) and instead suggesting that men ought to live up to this standard of masculinity still. *That* is one of the issues.",null,0,null,1428926149,null,0,false,0,cqapz29,null,t3_32faua,null,t1_cqapz29,null,t1_cqaojlt,null,null,null,1432362551,null,48,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,48,null

&gt; ""Oh but the money made from drugs can be spent on the NHS"" it does not sit comfortably with me to privatise addiction of the vulnerable and sick for the benefit of big corporations.

I think you made an unjustifiable leap from ""funnelling tax money from into the NHS"" to ""privatising the NHS"". It isn't privatising (which is a very scary word). There's no move from public to private control: users pay tax to the government (public sector) which then in turn puts it into the NHS (public sector).

Also, not all drug takers are ""vulnerable"" - again, another scary word. If you're talking about all drugs (like you said) then I'd say 95% of the population take some form of drug, yet wouldn't class 95% of the population as vulnerable.

If we take away vulnerable and privatisation, your argument is that you're not comfortable with a certain set of people paying for a certain service off the government. What about TV licensing, the BBC, roads, hospitals, schools etc. They're all paid for in exactly the same way: taxes, some of which target the users (e.g. ""road tax"", TV license, prescription costs.)

&gt;  My biggest concern is flooding the market with recreational drugs we would be opening the floodgates with drug problems (stealing, asb etc.)

My understanding was that a lot (if not the majority) of drugs related criminal behaviour was from individuals who struggle finding work because of previous drug related convictions, or time out of society from drugs related custodial sentences. In my experience, the average drug taker (e.g. weed smokers, coffee drinkers, ecstacy users, tobacco smokers) doesn't engage in the crime you're talking about because it drugs don't consume their entire life. That sort of crime is committed by a tiny minority of drug users. Just as a minority of people use kitchen knives to kill others, we don't restrict the liberty of others by saying nobody can buy knives, but we do restrict super dangerous knives from being sold to super ""vulnerable"" people like children. I think most advocates of legalisation think cannabis and other drugs should be treated like tobacco or knives: available from trusted, regulated sources for those who want them and are old enough to understand the consequences of them.

Much of this is anecdote, but I'm pretty certain there's evidence out there to support my main arguments.

And if you're not one of the highly sought after males, how can you not have a bleak perspective?

Thier blushes are also very pigmented. Great to work with and also very pigmented. None of thier products look ashy on me and the reviews I've read from darker skinned people are very positive. Also stocked in Boots and Superdrug which are both doing 3 for 2 on Makeup at the moment.  

Makeup Revolution is a really good cheap brand but I've only got a few singles buy them. MUA is also anther good cheap brand which I have singles for. Of the two I much prefer MUA singles, they're nicely pigmented and are a dream to work with. Either of these two are good starter palettes for the price, pigment and general raves about them. 

I'd like to reccomended you get some eye primer, for me especially having hooded and oily lids they help stop creasing. You can get them from a lot of shops. some sheer, some pale nude/ some medium nude and the odd dark nude. If you want recs let me know.

however people like you who think you should dictate how society should related with a forced program and agenda i really dont like.

you have every right and should have to put value in characteristics how you see fit.

if you want to think its manly to cry then you are free to do so, if you think the opposite you are free to do so too, but you should not dictate to others what they should and shouldn't value.

There were massive shortcomings in the squad. Losing any of the key players during any time of the season could've been a disaster - we didn't have cover for positions. It didn't happen. Sturridge was injured only for just over a month and didn't have that much niggling injuries - that was extremely lucky. 

The 16-game unbeaten run at the end was the reason we could even think about getting anywhere near the top of the table. By the end of that run the key players were fatigued, Henderson got suspended against City, Sturridge got injured against City. We were instantly significantly worse without them. That *drop* was overdue, and because it came so late it felt like the title was much closer than it really was.

You could only do that much with the resources that you have. And that 84 points was pretty much maximum you could get out of that team. Even that amount still looks unrealistic.

One of this decades biggest lies. Men under perform in virtually every social metric compared to women, from education to social factors, suicide rate, health, and life expectancy.

Patriarchy was only ever about benefiting a smaller elite class of men.  I guess none of those coal miners or conscripted soldiers or any of the hundreds of thousands of men who occupied the dogshit tier of society can ever complain though, because most men benefited from patriarchy.

People like 'SCIENCE' when they can use it as a stick to beat their political opponents over the head with. So the left loves 'SCIENCE' when it comes to global warming, drugs and prison reform and the right loves 'SCIENCE' when it comes to GM crops, nuclear power and genetics / heritability. Neither side will talk about experimental results which cause problems for their preferred position (which is what the theory of science - rather than SCIENCE - is actually all about), and neither side will ever suggest putting a pet theory to a test which could disprove it, which is what the empirical part of science - rather than SCIENCE - is predicated on.

Any politician that was genuinely interested in doing science rather than the particular brand of SCIENCE pushed by his or her tribe would quickly find themselves out of a job. Science is high-status, so obviously voters will *say* they care about it, and SCIENCE is hard to distinguish from science if you don't think about it carefully (which nobody really has much incentive to do, because it might cast doubt on a pet theory). In reality all I think most people care about is using SCIENCE whenever it supports their worldview and dismissing any data which does not.

I am very against this. Every time someone invokes SCIENCE to win an argument they cheapen the credibility of 'science' as an activity, even if they have the best of intentions, and eventually science is going to end up like statistics - a field which people can just dismiss out of hand (""You can prove anything with statistics"") without even bothering to consider the argument being made.

First of all, the long term effects of even the less harmful illegal drugs are currently unknown. For example, there is evidence to suggest cannabis, in the form of skunk, can cause psychosis later in life. Outside some corner cases (such as those who take cannabis for MS) the health benefits of most illegal drugs is undoubtably negative, regardless of how small that negative is. As the name implies, these drugs are for ""recreation"" as they are not necessary, thus why should we allow people to worsen their health or little or no reason? Though one could argue most recreation comes with a risk, drug use is not a recreation for anything meaningful and constructive. A society where people spend their free time getting high instead of bettering themselves at something does not sound like a great aspiration. Drugs are risk without little long-term reward.

Secondly, the drug industry is already very large and corrupt. Unlike alcohol that can be produced domestically and therefore better controlled most illicit drugs need to be grown in countries that we have little control over. In almost every one of these countries the drugs market is under the thumb of criminal organisations. Every time we buy drugs  we are putting more money in the hands of criminals and extending the suffering of those under their control or innocent people who just get caught in the middle. Legalisation is not going to change this, it's just going to make them more powerful. Look at the diamond industry in Africa, for example or pretty much any commodity above a certain price threshold.

Domestically it's a similar story because, as Colorado has shown, legalisation does not stop black market trade and, in fact, increases it (http://www.cnbcprime.com/marijuana/video/pot-after-hours-the-black-market/)

Again, before I get angry PMs about this. I'm playing devils advocate here. I agree with most of what OP says. I don't really care about hearing the counter arguments because I know them. My point is, there are arguments for keeping them illegal and they shouldn't be completely ignored.

null,false,ex-turpi-causa,eng-GreaterLondon,London Liberal,null,"&gt; You are reading a policy proposal as if it were completed legislation.

Sort of, but not quite. I'm reading a policy proposal *envisioning* how it would look as legislation, and how it might play out in practice. I do this because I'm a lawyer, and because policy always comes before and after law is made. 

&gt; If this were to ever become an actual law it would have specific standards codified into law. 

This isn't necessarily correct although it isn't impossible either. They would have to weigh up how rigidly they want to or are able to frame the law.

&gt; In fact some example of the types standards are even mentioned in the proposal.

This contradicts your point about me reading the policy as legislation. It's not legislation, obviously, but it is the starting template. 

&gt; Maximum numbers of deaths per year.

I think it's good they continue to statistically monitor all of this. My concern is that it translates into bad law. It's a bit like having a weight class/restriction in wrestling. When at or nearing the boundary, people do even worse things to avoid detection or attempt to bypass the system. It's the simple fact of unintended consequences, which are even more pronounced when sweeping changes are attempted. As the famous legal adage goes, ""Hard cases make bad law."" 

&gt; You could quite easily set up measurable, enforceable standards that would improve the welfare standards

You could indeed, but the standards themselves would be highly disputable and flakey considering they relate to the welfare of an animal, which cannot tell us as well as a human about how these standards impact him/her. This isn't to say we should have no standards, however, but rather that I believe the Greens want to move the bar too high, too quickly. 

&gt; You are wilfully or unwillfully misinterpreting that statement by ignoring the context of the question she was answering.

Not at all, I'm drawing an accurate analogy between two parties that are highly principled on certain hot-button issues. Neither will rule out these questions because the issues are a big part of what they stand for, so will undoubtably want to retain those kinds of options, lest they appear to contradict their own philosophies. 

I mentioned in another post (not sure if with you) that the distinction between the Grand National and other races would be too tenuous to sustain in the legal context. You could outline a very specific exception, but it would probably fall apart because if you start imposing these kinds of changes to the flagship of all horseraces, you will eventually need to do the same for other animal races or even other animal competitions more generally. You can consider in a less technical way as well that it could shift the 'contraband' to lesser regulated events, which the rules will eventually have to expand and chase down again. 

&gt; Not sure of your point here, other than the Green Party hold a different opinion than other parties. We want a diversity of ideas not an intellectual hegemony.

What I'm saying is that this is my issue with the party. Like Ukip, their stances on the issues they consider important are extreme and relatively unhelpful in any practical sense. Diversity of ideas is good, but unfortunately the Greens are a rather homogenous party, demographically and ideologically speaking. 

Their idealism tends to trump real-world considerations in favour of rapid and radical changes that in the context of an old, well-established democracy like the UK are plainly impractical. What a democracy like the UK needs, and how it works, are baby steps gently steering the behemoth's course. Meanwhile the Green party is barely able to crawl but insists that they and everyone else should start sprinting. 

&gt; Well the Animal Rights Act 2007 introduced a lot of new restrictions on what could be done to domestic and livestock animals.

I agree, and very much welcome such a display of disapproval against animal cruelty. But what this Act does, and requires, is falls short of the extent of bureaucracy it would take to regulate a sporting industry independently and to levy an additional tax on some associated activities. It's also of somewhat negligible practical effect: 

&gt; ""The vast majority of pet owners and others involved with the care of animals have nothing to fear from this legislation. This Bill is aimed at those few who do not properly fulfil their responsibilities for the animals in their charge.""

Again, I don't think anyone disagrees with the principle since cruelty is at the extreme end of the specturm. The problem is what the literature refers to as 'scope creep' on the back of relatively vague notions of welfare. Ironically as well, the Bill was introduced in the House of Lords, one of the Green party's favourite institutions. 

&gt; Complete hearsay based on a misinterpretation and your own bias.

It wasn't really hearsay as it came from my own thinking rather than a third party once removed. 

Call it a misinterpretation is you like, but it's more of an educated characterisation based on the number of things they consider to be problematic. I'm merely extrapolating from that, their rhetoric and what their members are like who, incidentally, lie about being supporters for no real reason other than to be able to tell me I ""misinterpreted"" some text.

There this reliance manifests itself as (respectively) financial ties to the arms lobby who have a vested interest that is provably contrary to public safety [see what happened in Australia] and voters who don't want an increase on a tax that has been declining in real revenue for the past 20 years [13% loss in revenue on fuel taxes].

Your points: If drugs were legalised, regulated and taxed:

&gt; Far less money spent on the police, prison and legal system

You have the problem that if all recreational drugs were legal, then a lot more people would likely use them. Which would lead to a lot more people dealing with the side effects and ending up causing problems while intoxicated.

&gt; Greatly reduced levels of crime especially organised crime

Organised crime will still find something to do. A new drug would likely be developed which is yet to be covered by legislation and then you're back to square one.

&gt; economic growth from a new industry and subsequent taxation

While there would be benefit from taxation, I don't think building new industry and economic growth around widespread recreational drug use is really a wise direction to head in.

&gt; Reduction in accidental deaths due to improved drug quality and transparency of substances.

Increased use via legalisation could increase the rate of accidental death.

&gt; Drug addicts receive treatment instead of a sentence that makes finding work extremely hard making them a burden to society

And yet, because it could allow more people to become drug addicts it would end up increasing the burden on society which a larger population having to receive treatment.

&gt; Reduction in prescription overdoses

This point has little standing.

&gt; The availability of drugs other than alcohol will lead to a reduction in alcohol related crime and accidents (IMO)

And lead to other drug-related crime and accidents.

&gt; Decreases the availability of these drugs for children (IMO - Growing up it was far easier for me to get cannabis than alcohol)

I would have to accept your own experience on that. For the most part, in my opinion, it wouldn't particularly have any affect on availability to children.

The tories have announced they're going to raise the threshold for inheritance tax to (effectively) £1 million. The public discussion on this has been moronic. Obviously all tax is annoying. Here are my top 6 reasons why inheritance tax is equitable, moral, and sensible.

1. We’ve lived through an era of appalling growth in income and asset inequality. Locking that in for a 2nd generation is very bad news.

2. Growth in house value is generously excluded from capital gains because you need to live in it. When you’re dead, that excuse is gone.

3. Housing wealth derives from the value of the land, which rises because of the actions of everyone in the country, not you.

4. Caring for the old is very costly. The old didn’t foresee this, and didn’t pay tax to fund it. Housing wealth will do nicely.

5. A country where you get ahead best by luck and inheritance, rather than hard work, is a lazy unfair country that will fail.

6. I totally get the primordial desire to do your best for your kids, but if your plan is to do that with banknotes, you’re doing it wrong.

You can structure games which resemble this feedback loop.  Say you have a game that revolves around rolling a dice, and whoever gets the highest score over a certain number of rolls wins.  The winner of a round is rewarded by being given, say, an extra point or two to add to any face of the die they like, thus making them more likely to win the next round.  Over time these advantages add up and the game becomes extremely unbalanced.  Inheritance is, essentially, a way of passing that weighted die onto your children and ultimately continues the feedback loop in perpetuity.  As Marx correctly noted, one of the great ironies of market based capitalism is that it destroys competition and inevitably leads to monpolies, both socially and in business.
