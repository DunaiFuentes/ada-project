The current government does this too, so don't forget that.

I often see Border Agency raids going down in the area of London I work in, and our government includes the left-wing Liberal Democrats so political leaning is a little irrelevant there.

If they're here illegally they'll get deported if caught, no matter who is in power.

And as far as accuracy goes, it would usually take a minimum of two years to leave the EU due to the Lisbon Treaty, not within 100 days.

You're basically betting that ad income of a paper with circulation (M)assive will make more money than ad income plus purchase price with circulation (S)mall

A good bet if your potential ad income per reader is quite big, and the potential increase from S to M is quite big

Neither of which seem applicable.  With the _Evening Standard_ for example their potential readership is ""anyone in London"", so the potential increase when they looked at going free was (8 million - paid readership) which is huge.  The NME's potential readership is ""people who like indie/rock, at a time when that represents the smallest slice of the popular music world probably since rock was invented"", where are the untapped millions of readers there?

Plus the value to advertisers can't be that great, the main thing you know the demographic wants to consume is music, which nobody buys anymore, in fact they're probably teens/students with low disposable in general.

It's very hard to make a case that it's one of the most biased publications in the UK. Although it tends to advocate a editorial line it does so openly and usually their editorial is accompanied by a in-depth piece on the issue involved that tends to be fair to both sides. 

For example it's much fairer to Ed Miliband than any other publication outside of The Guardian and The Mirror that I have seen. 

It's not really elitist either. It's argued for increasing the minimum wage for example and against CEOs having pay wildly out of proportion to their employees. It's argued for nationalised healthcare.

At £200,000 your stamp duty will be £1500, solicitors probably £1200-£1400. Mortgage valuation and mortgage arrangement fee could both be zero but equally could be £400 and £1000 (although you could add the arrangement fee to the mortgage itself). That's over 4k which you need separate to your deposit. That's assuming no home buyers report (optional) and no light refurbishment needed nor any need for any furniture nor any need for emergency fund. I'd want at least another £1000 but ideally £3,000.

Your purchase price is no where near what you are aiming for. If you do not have cash separate for these costs you will have to reduce your deposit. If we assume £5,000 separate then your deposit is £20,000 and you can therefore only buy at £195,000.

My job is safe and the field I am within is growing rapidly; *however* the NHS is short of funds which means not enough Radiologists are being trained (increasing the work load for everyones) AND may find it difficult to fund new MRI, CT scanners. I'm worried the NHS will make the mistake of turning to the private sector - this has happened before in Radiology and has been a fairly poor deal for patient's and the NHS which end up paying more overall for a lower quality service and not even owning anything (like the machines) at the end of it. So although I am personally in a good position I do worry about the bigger picture and whether the NHS is being run well for the patients long term. Ironically it's not government neglect that is the problem, but rather ideology-driven interference. I don't think it matters who *owns* the NHS (private public etc) but rather that it just isn't feasible to run it as a for-profit venture AND provide universal cover AND cost the same. Politicians don't seem to get that, and it worries me that we're sleep walking into a for-profit system which will cost much more overall.

I'm not sure where you've got that from and i think that you're linking my argument to a whole host of other things. I was simply pointing out your logic was flawed and could be applied in an argument the direct opposite of your point.

Simply the petition is to Selfridges, not the government, it may be cynical and i can't speak for everyone signing the petition but it does feel like getting outraged for the sake of it. Removing the spikes does absolutely nothing to alleviate the state of the homeless and if the post on here claiming a homeless person was interviewed on the news and said no one even slept there then it gives some evidence that the petition is more for the people signing it than actually helping the homeless.

I'd absolutely be all for more pressure on the government to tackle homeless (albeit a petition would likely be useless in achieving this) at it's root causes e.g. our god awful drugs policies, poor social care, poor treatment of mental health issues, non-living minimum wages, un-affordable housing and the labour abuse we see with zero hours contracts.

Sure the spikes are pretty immoral but all this petition does is let a few people pat themselves on the backs thinking they've done a good thing whilst the homeless go back to living on street corners.

If Aberdeen want more tickets build yourself a bigger fucking stadium and stop blaming other people (Celtic in this case) for your fucking problems.

Bottom line: I'm almost certain Celtic didnt spend millions buildIng and maintaining a 60,000 seater so they could give away fans more tickets.

Last season away, MP went with Kolarov on the left, right? Does anyone else expect them to do it again? 

Our form has been horrendous at home (at our standards) but I really think that we should go out and attack this. With that in mind:

-------------Hart-----------------

Sagna----Kompany---Demi------Clichy

-------Yaya--------Dinho----------

Nasri--------Aguero---------Silva

--------------Bony---------------


I am quite worried about the speed of Demichelis at the back, Dinho's ability to win hard tackles, and the tracking back of Silva/Nasri. But again, I really think City should try to win this at home. Barca has been known to be much more vulnerable when teams actually attempt to take it to them. I really feel like this lineup could counter-attack effectively (if Barca control possession) and control/create (if Barca cede possession). Of course this is provided Bony is fit and fitting in.

Sometimes the chances are not that you will find work. People who have particular skills may find there are no jobs around for their skills. Moving house is not easy for many (plus is expensive and not actually financially feasible). If you have done one sort of job for ages then companies assume you may not be interested in their (different) role, or just assume you are stuck in your ways.

I can give you an example. I just hired someone who has changed careers. I am really pleased to give this person a leg up. But they had to jump through some serious hoops to get the job.

The franchise was always set to make money and would have probably returned profit for those companies who threw it away towards the end of the 10 year period.  However it was always predicted with the rising passenger numbers that it would only happen at the end of the period, so I can understand why the companies were uneasy about it.

That said, we already install artificial limits on the prices of tickets, because the rail lines are monopolies and there is no option for the passengers to take it.  If we wanted to, we could install artificial limits that reduced the prices significantly, thus reducing the premium we'd get from each franchise (or we could pay companies to do them).  There's no reason to suggest that lower prices couldn't be achieved within the existing structure and there is nothing to suggest that if they were nationalised then they would be any cheaper.

* Stridex Red Pads

Not really. The government today already handles the purchasing decisions for trains, and they effectively buy them. If the government wanted to get rid of the pacers today they could do it. They haven't. Same reason why down here in the SW we have to deal with a train line that hasn't seen upgrade work since Brunel was alive, and we have trains from the 70s/80s too.

If you actually look into how much say and control the government has, nationalisation wouldn't drastically change this.

I'm a contractor so move from Company to Company - after a tough few years companies are spending money again, the Government is spending on infrastructure again and the market is benefiting.

The 'noughties' was a big period of outsourcing of work to India, China and Eastern Europe however increasingly this work is coming back to the UK. Companies want to be able to meet face to face with their suppliers to solve issues and work together and this isn't possible if the customer and supplier are 1000s miles apart. It's also no where near as cheap as first thought and as the industry becomes increasingly precision biased we are playing in to the UK's ""right first time"" ethic. We have a long tradition of quality, reliability and creativity in Engineering and other countries are coming to us.

The biggest challenge in [Engineering is the shortfall](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/11204563/UKs-engineering-shortage-must-and-can-be-fixed.html). There are not enough people out there leaving school becoming Engineers. Great for me now - wages are rising steadily - however not good for the future unless we can get people to start becoming Engineers.

If you're reading this, you're in school/College consider Engineering. Wages are good and getting better. The career is stimulating and interesting, from building Jet Engines or Performance Cars through to getting dirty in a processing plant there's a huge variety to the career and it's what I think the UK is known for.

null,false,domalino,logo,,null,"It's Barca, I reckon we'll only play Aguero, especially given Bony only arrived today. Kolarov on the left was to counteract the Alves-Messi partnership which was Barca's leading way of scoring goals (and it worked against us after Kolarov was sacrificed because of the red card) but Kolarov was in much better form and Messi-Neymar is the big threat out on our RB area these days. 

I see Navas playing because he does a much better job defensively than Nasri (remember Southampton? So good the bbc and MNF did an in depth analysis of his defending) and his pace is going to be vital on the counter attack - which is obviously Barca's biggest weakness. Pellegrini's old side Villareal tore them apart a few weeks ago, and if they had finishers like Aguero, they'd have thrashed Barca. And he'll keep Alba pinned back and give us width, Barca will love it if we play narrow in tight spaces. 

The back 4 picks itself, demichelis is definitely the better choice at the moment, Yaya is suspended so it will be the two ferns, and the only big decision really is Milner or Nasri. Milner is playing great and will work really hard, inattack and defence, but Nasri holds onto the ball like no one else, and we can't concede the possession battle to Barca - plus he showed he's up for the big games against Roma. Whichever starts, and I guess performances on Saturday will play a part, the other will come on at about 65mins anyway.

Positives: We walk away with a a draw and a crucial away goal, despite being outplayed for long stretches of the game. Hazard looked excellent as always. I think seeing Cech get more starts has lit a fire in Courtois, MOTM without a doubt in my mind, absolutely killed it today, without him we don't walk away with a draw.

Negatives: Defense looked very susceptible today, several times they left people unmarked in the box and let them get free headers at goal. Cahill at fault for the goal, left Cavani unmarked right behind him, with Zouma's form lately I can see Cahill losing even more minutes now. Costa looked nothing like himself today, though I suppose it could be chalked up to rust, having not played a game in over 2 weeks.

Like you say, quite a few players have come out and bad-mouthed his man management. It's weird because Rodgers has this rep of being a very modern manager, but in this respect he's pretty old-school, expecting his players to just deal with it and not really seeming to be bothered by any sort of psychological approach.

While I anticipate automated testing only getting more prevalent, I also agree with [James Bach](http://www.satisfice.com/blog/archives/58) in that manual testing is still necessary - at the very least because we can't yet program computers to think like humans.

The exception is computer games testing, where automation is more difficult. But it's notoriously low paid and unlikely to change - manual testers are ten a penny because *everyone* thinks they can test video games. On balance you'll tend to get two or three *good* testers out of every ten hired (assuming the same level of experience), who will work up the ranks to become test lead, realise that they're still making barely two quid above minimum wage and either retrain to go into project management or learn Python, become automation testers and find work in non-games software testing.",null,0,null,1424209556,null,0,1424209872,0,coojhf1,null,t3_2w6vq7,null,t1_coojhf1,null,t3_2w6vq7,null,null,null,1424644881,null,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2,null

They also questioned whether or not Spurs really could finance it, if they were actually committed to do it which is a bit laughable - they made the point here that we were exploring the possibility of moving into the olympic arena which is void anyway, and if it was a viable business plan to build  the stadium. 

Archway's QC then went on to say that the Secretary of State is clearly not being informed of the most up to date info before he's making his decision which is retarded.

After Archway's QC was done giving evidence, a QC from the Treasury Solicitors Department then went up and slammed Archway's claims - saying there was no ground of challenge on the validity of the CPO adding that there was a ""degree of artificiality"" about the claims (rekt). He blasted the claims that the Secretary of State wasn't kept up to date and said he had been very involved and didn't take the decision lightly.

It doesn't mean that the people doing the shaming are necessarily right - only that they have the most social power.  After all, 100 years ago, it would have been politically incorrect to support homosexual rights or rights for people from different ethnic groups.

Want someone to stop expressing an opinion you disagree with?  You have to actually change their mind through reason.  You have to convince them that they're wrong.  

Edit:  A common response I get is that some people don't listen to reason.  Well, if a person can't be convinced that his/her ideas are wrong, then doesn't that person still have a duty to speak his/her mind?  Isn't it a form of moral cowardice to not speak simply because you fear being socially shamed for your opinion?

I'm seeing a weird split lately, I know of a lot of schools and local authorities outsourcing to premises management companies, and o also see new academies and redeveloping schools going back to residential caretakers, living in a semi or detached house on site.

Still a lot of the traditional. Caretaking jobs about, not many immigrant caretakers I know, cleaners yes, caretakers no. Local authority funding is most definitely putting a squeeze on us, which means maintenance costs have to keep coming down which means sometimes the schools aren't in perfect condition. This leads to the articles in the daily mail saying schools are unfit but in my opinion I believe it is due to lack of understanding of what actually goes in to keeping a school safe, clean and looking decent.

The thing with maths is that if you know the content then you know you can do said content. For example, if you know how to factorise, then you can do any problem - it's just with different numbers, but it's the same steps. So most importantly - learn the steps when solving problems. 

Do past papers. Print two copies off. Do the first one completely independently and mark it. Annotate it if you wish, but do this in a different colour. Then, with the second paper, answer the questions with the mark scheme next to you. Highlight what you need to do to get different marks, whether with an actual highlighter after, or in a different pen. The point of this is to learn the *game* of the mark scheme. I'll use GCSE biology for this example, but the same applies for maths: 

*""What is osmosis?""* (3 marks)  
The movement of **water particles** from a **dilute to a concentrated** solution across a **partially permeable membrane**.

After doing many past papers, you'll be able to read questions and see what it is you need to do for the marks. It is, essentially, a game - and those that play it correctly get the top marks.

The dentist won't do anything you don't want them to do (they are YOUR teeth). They will remove the tooth if you ask. Let me tell you though, having a tooth removed is much more unpleasant than repair work, and you still need to let them anesthetise the area. Fillings are painless, modern anesthesia is magic, and you very quickly forget there is any metal in your mouth. This is from a girl who stopped looking after her teeth in her early teens and didn't start again until adulthood. Let the dentist do whatever they want to fix your teeth now and you'll be in the best possible position to not need any more work in future. Be brave.

If you don't like the repair then get the tooth pulled, same end result but at least you tried.

I know all the great coaches and managers have sticky situations, especially when they're young, but you've got to admire how Rodgers dug himself out of the situation. I think Rodgers learned a harsh lesson on the reality of top level coaching in regards to confidence and personal issues, him sticking with a keeper with no confidence that was getting worse every week, Gerrard's legs going and still not being removed out of the team, Skrtel and Lovren just not working and Rodgers not changing it and immobile strikers upfront that couldn't follow Rodgers' blueprint. Those were the reasons for how badly we were doing at the start of the season. But he's changed it all, the formation change was spot on and he's getting the best out of all the players.

The comparison with Klopp is interesting because anyone with a fairly decent standard of coaching experience would've told you that what Klopp was trying to do was never going to last. His coaching methods are extreme (althought not Magath extreme) levels and I'm not surprised as to how badly they are doing this season. If Klopp tweaked some of his coaching methods he could fix the situation. And for me, that's what separates a good coach from a great coach. The ability to fix issues within a team. An average coach would've just panicked (something I suspect Rodgers did do) and just continue with the belief that everything would become right in the end whereas a great coach would try different things and make adjustments here and there. Rodgers dug himself a hole at the start of the season with persistence of doing something which just wasn't working and I admire that he fixed our issues.

Was better suited on the right wing playing in a defensive team, or as the most aggressive player in a 3 man central midfield.

 It's worth noting as well how people actually consume news.  

[This](http://www.gallup.com/poll/163412/americans-main-source-news.aspx) gallup poll gives a pretty good picture of national news consumption in the US. Television accounts for 55% of news consumptions over there; they don't have the same broadcasting regulations that we do so national news comes through sensationalists like CNN or unashamedly partisan channels like MSNBC and Fox. Internet sites comes next - which is obviously far more advertising driven and entirely unregulated; judging from the stuff my freinds post on facebook these are sites like the drugde report and breitbart that make Guido Fawkes look liberal. A bulk of this will be tweets sumarising stories or comments on the page rather than the stories themselves too. Print comes next - and, aside from the new york times, the publications you mentioned aren't even there - the bulk of consumption will come from gossip magazines and tabloids. Finally - talk radio makes up 5% of consumption and in the states this is basically right-wing crap that truckers listen to like  - Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh and even Alex Jones.

In the UK things are on the decline and we have some big popular outlets like the Daily Mail and the Sun and some people even get their news from things like the Lad Bible on Facebook. Still though, the BBC makes up for the vast majority on news consumption over here - and although it has its flaws, you only need look at the way american redditors talk about it to see how much better it is than 99% of what you get in the states.

Your payslip should show your tax and NI so I would check that first.

He would look poor playing next to matic in that system as well. Fabregas is wasted in this system we play against tough opposition regardless where he plays. All of Fabregas' best games have come were we have more possession. His constrant distribution of the ball is amazing and when we don't have control of the game possession wise our passing is much sloppier and his passing is less effective. Fabregas' best attribute is making the best pass all the time, wherever it's a short pass to a CB or a flashy long pass. Options on the ball are limited in this system and the player do not look comfortable in keeping possession, probably from fear of loosing the ball high up the pitch. This if further shown as our GK only punted it up-field on goal kicks, instead of distributing it from the back like we always do.


Jose doesn't like it, but I'd rather we play the normal 4-2-3-1 system with oscar which presses high and we are willing to be patient in it's build up. In the current one, we look to get it up the pitch and find costa or pass to hazard. He has no options on the ball of course as we lack support so his only option is too dribble past several players and get fouled. Notice he isn't fouled as much in normal games because we play more expansive, we hold the ball therefore we can find him in greater space where he has space to run into and players to pass to. We don't move forward enough to give the player on the ball options  so we end up conceding possession.

&gt;Yet is offal equal to the beef before?

If you want to account for the substitutes inferior quality, that's what hedonics does.

But for something where it's hard to measure the inferiority of offal vs beef quantitatively, hedonics becomes highly speculative and you're better of just leaving it alone.

Yes, the substitution principle doesn't account for inferiority in the substitute, that is a well known flaw. Using hedonics to 'fix' the flaw is a bad idea, so we don't do it.

But because substitution does occur in real life, models are needed to account for this. Flawed models, but better than no models. There is no such thing a perfect model anyway.

Hedonics and the substitution principle aren't perfect. In statistics, every model, formula and stat has it's pros and cons. Only amateurs pretend statistics are a perfect presentation of real life, because they never are.

The CPI isn't the perfect representation of inflation, it's why other stats like core CPI and RPI still exist, so that policy makers can look at everything to glean a truer picture. 

But taking the substitution principle out of CPI would make the CPI less accurate, not more.

While the obvious example is hate speech which is, rightly in my opinion, against the law here there are more subtle examples of where political incorrectness can have dangerous consequences. If it is okay to make ""offensive"" jokes and comments about certain element of  society it is possible that these jokes creep in to the national consciousness and harden in to prejudice and discrimination. Its the slippery slope argument and i think it does have some merit to it.

You seem to have fallen into the trap of looking at a notional figure and thinking that's the value of the trade. I can make a 1 yard (billion) trade with another counterparty tomorrow, and the PV (value) of that trade tomorrow will be 0, not a yard. Yet misinformed journalists will report that I've made a billion pound trade, when I absolutely haven't. When to comes to funding that trade (which costs - yet another deriv in that funding strategy because I might have to find in a currency that is not my home one - oh no!), I won't get anywhere near that amount. 

Plus, you could just compress the hell out of the notional outstanding figures - but there's no real need most of the time. 

Anyway, read up about the notional on a deriv and you'll start to understand its a meaningless headline figure. I can understand why headlines of X trillion in derivatives are outstanding, but it's a total horseshit number. It's like me lending you £20, you lending your friend £20 and that happening a hundred times. Really only £20 is owed cumulatively, though if you wanted to sound fancy you could say £20,000 is outstanding - when it isn't. We could compress those loans to the total outstanding is back to £20, but economically it's all the same.

&gt;If it is okay to make ""offensive"" jokes and comments about certain element of society it is possible that these jokes creep in to the national consciousness and harden in to prejudice and discrimination.

Who said it's OK?  You're confusing the idea that it should be possible to express a statement with the normative claim that it's desirable to say that statement.

Supporting free speech *doesn't* mean that you think that all opinions are morally equivalent!  And it certainly doesn't mean that you think that there's no harm to e.g. racist remarks. 

Furthermore - you claim that it's possible that bad ideas could harden into prejudice.  But that's exactly why free-speech is needed!  So that we can criticize *any* idea, no matter how pervasive or entrenched it's become.  

There's no evidence that eroding free-speech actually removes bad ideas from the idea-pool.  In fact, last time I looked, countries in which Holocaust denial is banned actually have *greater* levels of Holocaust denial after the restrictions come into effect.

null,false,Jo3Fr3sh,newcr-1,Nai Smith Naismith Optimum,null,"The coach.

1. The style of play that changed with Martinez becoming the head coach was anticipated by other teams in the league this year. 

2. The team also lacks depth as Martinez doesn't play the youth unless he is forced to. 

3. He has fielded players out of their natural position: Naismith, Barkley, Lukaku. 

4. Poor substitutions. This year Martinez has gotten it wrong more often than right. There was one game he didn't even make a substitution. 

Players 

Osman, Barry, Distin, Pienaar all are pushing retirement. Last year's run was a combination of a strong defense with a new style of play, Martinez's School of Science. Osman and Pienaar have been oft injured while Distin form had dropped off to such an extent he is no longer on the bench most games. 

Barry has had good games but he is also getting past it. For some reason Martinez has played him in almost every game this season. His lack of pace in the midfield develops problems as other players need to cover when he loses the ball. 

Barkley has not developed at the rate everyone had hoped for as a player. In addition with McCarthy, Besic, Barry, Naismith (properly more of a false 9) and Oviado, when he doesn't play left back, the midfield gets crowded. We don't have a good rotation for the midfield along with injuries and lack of depth in addition to the Europa league games have added to the drop off.  

Goaltending- Tim Howard has let in some howlers this season that has lost us games. Hopefully he will find his form here on out. 

Lukaku - just doesn't look interested lately after playing injured for the beginning of the season (World Cup hangover?) he has a horrible first touch and gets caught offsides way too much. 

Tactics 

Martinez has seemed reluctant to change his philosophy till the past few games when we have since tightened up defensively. Much of the passing and ball control seems pointless and doesn't develop into a threatening attack in the final third. Instead we seem to lose the ball near midfield and are exposed to a counter attack. Most teams this season have been playing a higher defensive line as a result. 

Then again I could be wrong.

&gt;You're confusing the idea that it should be possible to express a statement with the normative claim that it's desirable to say that statement.

I have not confused it, i just disagree with it. i am saying that the undesirable statements (such as hate speech) should be limited by law.

&gt;Furthermore - you claim that it's possible that bad ideas could harden into prejudice. But that's exactly why free-speech is needed! So that we can criticize any idea, no matter how pervasive or entrenched it's become. 

From an idealistic point of view i agree but from a practical point of view i do not. If those bad ideas are limited and not allowed to spread then that itself is a unspoken criticism of the idea.

You should not be surprised now that Sully still plans to fire Sam if we don't make Europe. Right now Europe is all but dead. I'm not saying we won't make Europe, just saying the cards a stacked against us.

But we spent north of 30M last summer and the board has said we plan to keep improving every summer. Despite spending 30M we were still in the black last year (one of only three BPL clubs, if I'm remembering it right). It isn't unrealistic to expect us to add another 10M to the total this coming summer. If we spend 40M we can easily purchase Song + Lukaku/Benteke + odds and ends. Remember, we bought Sakho for 3.5M, Cresswell for 3M. There are good, quality players to be had without breaking the bank, so to speak.

What I'm saying is, if we don't renew with Sam, you can expect to see some of Sam's guys go, in addition to the money the board is already willing to spend.

Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backward—reversing cause and effect. I call these the ""wet streets cause rain"" stories. Paper's full of them.

null,false,WeaponizedKissing,null,null,null,"The fact that you paid the previous tenants your deposit money, rather than it being officially entered swapped/whatever in a DPS is probably problematic. I think you may have to be prepared to treat the deposit situation as if you have been there from the very beginning and any damages are actually your damages.

&gt;However, she acknowledges this damage was not caused by us or flatmates during our tenancy - but by previous tenants who were on the original tenancy from 2012

The above might prove useful if you wish to argue the situation, as if she has said the above in emails or writing then you have written proof of her admitting that you are not liable for any of the damages. However, you don't have any proof/contract that you paid any deposit money, so while you may not end up being liable for anything you may not get anything back. This particular point might be better addressed by some legal counsel that knows what they are doing.

For future reference, don't ever just give money to previous tenants. Do it all officially!

Despite all of that... in all of my renting experience one person has acted as the main point of contact, so hopefully one of the current tenants is still on all the paper work and can be that main point of contact, get any refund once the issues are resolved, and distribute it amongst you all.

However...

&gt;however has pre-warned us we are not likely to get any deposit back due to damage

She can't really just say and do that.

If the landlord has put the deposit in a protection scheme, then at the end of the tenancy she has to provide an itemised list of all of the deductions she intends to take from the deposit for repairs/replacemnts. You can then argue ones that you feel are unreasonable. If the landlord still won't budge, then you can take it up with the DPS company to act as an adjudicator, and if that still fails, you can take it to court.

There are a number of things that the landlord has to consider when deciding how much money to ask to take from the deposit:

1. She can only charge for things that are beyond general wear and tear, and when deciding if something counts, she has to consider the length of the tenancy, the number of tenants etc. For example, if the original tenancy ran from 2012 and it's a 6 person flat then you are going to expect carpet/wooden floor wear in heavy traffic areas. However, if you've burnt a hole completely through, you would be liable for damages.

2. If the landlord intends to replace actually damaged items with new ones, you can only be expected to pay like-for-like. For example, if the property was furnished and included an old 22"" CRT TV that you've broken, the landlord can't charge you the cost to replace it with a new 42"" flatscreen.

3. If the landlord intends to replace carpet/furniture because it's worn/redecorate because paint work is lacklustre, she can't charge you for that. It's likely that carpet would have been there for many years and it is completely unreasonable for you to be expected to pay because she wants to redecorate.

The most important thing to remember about the deposit is that it is legally yours (or in this case, the previous tenants') at all times. The burden of proof is on the landlord to prove and make a compelling argument for damages. If it goes to adjudication through the DPS you can submit whatever evidence you have to prove that you are not liable for damages.

You're asking from a different perspective though, if what you're doing is seen to be disruptive or intimidating, you could find yourself in trouble.

Interestingly, I think, in Japan there is conventionally a strict contrast between what you say in public and the opinions you share in private.

I'll ask again - what is the absurdist commentary of this joke?

'I have a theory about the reason Jordan married a cage fighter - she needed a man strong enough to stop Harvey from fucking her'

Because it sounds like you don't understand it either and instead of taking a simple blunt shock joke on face value, you're attempting to obscure it in pretentious bollocks.

Take the other joke he does about Jordan...

'Apparently Jordan and Peter Andre are fighting each other over custody of Harvey, well eventually one of them’ll lose and have to keep him.'

That does have genuine ""subtext"", even if the target of the joke on face value is a child with down-syndrome, so you could argue it has a redemptive quality. Even then its a joke about the vain, selfish nature of celebrity culture.

But what defense does the cage fighter joke have? Its clearly a nasty, nasty joke that appeals due its shock value, cruelty and taboo-ness.

&gt;How long will it take me to find a GP?

If you know where you are going to be living you can find your local one [now](http://www.nhs24.com/findlocal/) if you want. Bear in mind that most surgeries cover a particular geographic area, so you may or may not have a huge amount of choice as to where you go.

&gt;Do you have walk-in clinics like in Canada where I could just tell a GP what prescriptions I'm currently taking and have him or her write me new ones?

They do in some areas (there is one in Manchester near where I live). I don't recall there being any in Glasgow when I lived there, but that was a good few years ago.

&gt;Or will I need to make an appointment?

Yes, but you will have to go in to the GP's to register anyway, so just be sure to ask them for an appointment when you go in to register, and have going in to register reasonably high on your list of things to do when you get here.

&gt;If so, how long might that take?

Depends, where I live if you tell them it is urgent you will get seen within a day or two, if not it could be a week (or two at the very worst). If you want to see a particular Doctor expect to wait longer than you would if you just take the first appointment available (which is what I usually do).

&gt;Will I need to have another evaluation done before I get my prescriptions filled, or will the new doctor just look at my current file and help me based on the information there? 

I would guess that the Doctor will want to have a chat with you before prescribing medicine to you, but I doubt that you will have a problem, particularly if there are negative side-effects if you come off your current meds. It would probably not be a bad idea to bring your medical history if you can, but I would bear in mind the fact that if you are bringing you medical file over from Quebec, and it happens to be in French, it probably won't be terribly useful to the average NHS doctor and they will probably just take your word regarding your medical history and start a new file for you from scratch. If they do this, it would be handy to have your file to hand anyway so that you can clue them in on your history, but as long as you know what meds you are on and why, you should be ok.",null,0,null,1424229283,null,0,false,0,coourf0,null,t3_2w8o2h,null,t1_coourf0,null,t3_2w8o2h,null,null,null,1424650252,null,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1,null

Also the mileage you rack up on a job like this isn't worth it in my opinion with your own bike. 

Also from what you said about chav areas in my experience the smaller places get targeted more as the drivers their usually have less safety protocols in place from drivers. Big chains like Domino's have rules such as the driver can't leave his bike alone if it is not a known address in the system and drivers can't carry more than a certain amount of cash on you (we limit our drivers at about £15 in our stores).

Rather, and I think this has already happened in defense and maybe midfield, the team has to change its game. It's a paradigm shift. 

Brendan has managed to amp up the defense in the wake of carra's departure. Whether or not the back three is a viable long term solution is another discussion. But even now in the midfield I think we've shown we can cope without Gerrard. It seems a bit wrong to say it, but he may not have as much the impact on the team in an operational sense.

There is nothing worse for a keeper than not playing. Regardless of the good, the bad, and the ugly, playing as much as possible is what makes a keeper better. The only time IMO he should ever be benched is when he is fatigued, or when he has *multiple* poor matches.

What I really love about the new setup is that it allows for a lot more of the sort of flexible players that BR wants to build his system on. The two wingback positions are great in that they've allowed us to get young players like Markovic, Ibe, on the pitch. Because it's a hybrid attacking/defending role it allows for an education on both for the young player. Same thing with the two wide CB roles, they also have this sort of hybrid role which has allowed for Can and Sahko to showcase their abilities to do more than just defend.

Ok, has the laughter ended?

 Nottingham. It's a compact city - everything in the centre is within around a square mile or two and the streets are easy to navigate - no labyrinth-esque spiderweb alleys for the most part, solid public transport that can get you anywhere around town for two quid (or free on a disability pass), and a wide range of age groups out on the social scene. Two uni's, one of which attracts the youngest and brightest and one that attracts the hard working grafters of all backgrounds, very good proper pub scene if you like that, enough party life to find it if you want it and go without if you don't, cheap day to day living (low rent - my two bed terrace is £475 a month, can get houseshares for much less or a one bed flat in some parts for less), low cost for usual daily stuff), and despite its 90's/early 00's reputation, really bloody safe unless you're in St Annes or the Meadows - and even then, trouble is rare unless you're somehow connected to the remnants of the bad times. Few are.

Other benefits include easy access to the rest of the country thanks to being slap bang in the middle of it, two big hospitals if you have health concerns, a good police force due to the 90's/00's stuff (I have seen it in action from both sides and have no complaints), and of course, Forest if you like your sports and/or need an alternative to Eastenders. Great music scene, a growing selection of good restaurants (and plenty of shit ones if it's been a hard month) and a budding grassroots comedy scene also. And Annie's Burgers for a solid helping of unhealthy grub.

As for friendly, I reckon we are! We're not isolated here and the uni's, geographical position in the country and general history mean plenty of people come and go in Notts and as such unless you meet the worst examples we're pretty welcoming of any and all.

And it beats Derby.

What? Of course it matters. It would matter if it was only 3 or 5 years. Let alone **10** whole years. 

Courtois already probably edges out Cech regardless of age, but when you throw in the difference it is insane not to make Courtois the main keeper. Thankfully Jose agrees, and Courtois was able to play a killer game today.

I am not really sure what you think Chelsea would gain from keeping Courtois benched. You are literally giving the player who is really the future of the club one less chance to keep proving himself. The more experience he gains the better he becomes and more confidence he has.

That said, there are times I am confused by his selection, and by far my biggest disappointment in his term at LFC was his treatment of Daniel Agger. In my (very) unprofessional opinion, Agger could still make a difference at the club, but he seemed to be run out of town against his will. I would swap Agger for Lovren any day of the week.

I think he's a very good manager on track to get even better, and he definitely has shown that he learns from his mistakes, which makes me excited about my future. That said, it's hard as a fan to have players you consider to be top class being run out of the club every summer.

&gt;

&gt;The __Locomotive Acts__ (or __Red Flag Acts__) were a series of [Acts of Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acts_of_Parliament_in_the_United_Kingdom) in the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom) regulating the use of mechanically propelled vehicles on British [public highways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_highway) during the latter part of the 19th century.

&gt;The first three, __The Locomotives on Highways Act 1861__, __The Locomotive Act 1865__ and the __Highways and Locomotives (Amendment) Act 1878__ contained restrictive measures on the manning and speed of operation of road vehicles; they also formalised many important road concepts such as vehicle registration, registration plates, speed limits, maximum vehicle weight over structures such as bridges, and the organisation of highway authorities.

&gt;The most draconic restrictions and speed limits were imposed by the 1865 act (the ""Red Flag Act"") which required all road locomotives, which included automobiles, to travel at a maximum of 4 mph (6.4 km/h) in the country and 2 mph (3.2 km/h) in the city - as well as requiring a man carrying a red flag to walk in front of road vehicles hauling multiple wagons.

Good for him to realize that it wasn't working, but that should have been far sooner. I don't know why he has a tendency to wait until the second half of the season to do so.

Second of all, you really need to not listen to what people say on /r/soccer. They are using this racism incident as an excuse to bash chelsea and the fans, that is almost as despicable as the act itself. 

Lets take a look at this incident shall we? We have about 10 drunk twats walking about in Paris displaying racist behaviour. WOW! Holy shit! This must have never happened before!11! Only Chelsea fans would do this!!! Typical Chelsea! 

Give me a fucking break. This shit happens all the fucking time in europe, this one just happened to be filmed. I went to the Camp Nou and saw a black Valencia fan being jeered outside the stadium by Barca fans making monkey noises, I've seen it a hell of a lot in Germany and Russia, and even though I haven't been to Italy I know its really prevalent there, as there have been MANY fan racism incidents reported from there. 

English fans have a bad reputation abroad in general, and the fact that these United, Liverpool, Arsenal fans are acting as if its ONLY chelsea fans that do this, not their own precious lot, as though they weren't fellow countrymen, is a JOKE. They literally think Chelsea fans are of a different breed. Believe it or not but even some Bayern fans are getting in on it (how fucking ironic)

So what does this mean? This incident was a perfect opportunity for these narrow minded bigots to bash more on Chelsea. They're jealous. They bring up a number of reasons why they hate Chelsea so let's take a look at a few of them. 

1. Sugar daddy club- Lol. As if Chelsea are the only club to be helped by money. As if United didn't just spend a ridiculous amount over the summer only to achieve nothing. As if Tottenham wouldn't have gladly accepted Abramovich taking ownership and pumping money into their club. As if City, Madrid, Juventus (notorious for this) etc.. aren't ""stealing talent"" from other clubs. Safe to say this is just another pathetic excuse to be jealous. We've been doing smart business over the last few transfer windows (actually making a profit) while they remain butthurt that they spend crazy amounts resulting in no success. 

2. Cunt players. Yeah that cant be right. prior to Costa, who was a cunt on Chelsea? Terry? Lol give me a break. If Terry's a cunt then giggs or rio would be the mother of them all. Even our team right now bar Costa... Oh yeah, Eden Willian Oscar Matic, Dave, they're all cunts! Absolutely dirty! lol.. Again, another stupid excuse.

3. The fans. I already explained this. Every team has its cunts, whether or not Chelsea has a few more or less then other fan supports shouldn't even fucking matter. 

4. Unattractive football. This one is my favourite. How can a team who's scoring the most goals and having the season with the most goals be unattractive? It must be a sin to defend it seems! Oh but its okay when Arsenal does it at City, that's ""smart and defensive football"". Mourinho's literally hitler for playing for a result. If we played attacking against that Barca team in 2012, we'd end up like Arsenal (not winning shit). Again, plenty of other teams do this, so this can't be the reason. Another sorry excuse.

What does this leave us with? Our success. We haven't lost against another top english side for over 2 seasons. Home and away. Imagine the frustration liverpool fans have that they could have won the league after so many years without trophies, only for it to be stopped by a handicapped Chelsea beating them at home. They couldn't break us. Arsix-nil speaks for itself, although they have some experience in taking it dry. Tottenham will never ever compete for a champions league and will never win a premier league, they're just a butthurt lot in general. They have nothing better to do but ogle over their hot young prospects (who eventually leave them) and bicker about Arsenal and Chelsea. They haven't beaten us at the bridge in over 20 years.(way before abramovich era)

I used to be like you, angered by the comments on /r/soccer. But it doesn't bother me as much anymore.

If other people's opinions bothers you too much and you really want to jump ship, then Barca would be a good team for you. Neutrals love them and they will always be top 5 in the world.

A vendor selling large volumes of cheap alcohol on a low margin for example could have the volume of alcohol on the licence reduced, making the vendor switch tactics and sell a smaller volume of higher margin alcohol.

International fee income is also very attractive because it is one of only two sources of income which unis can spend however they like (donations being the other). 

International students are financially propping up UK universities and subsidising the education of UK students. Any shiny new buildings on university campuses are often largely funded by international fee income, for instance. 

It's also worth noting that until some funding reforms which essentially uncapped the number of UK/EU students unis can take, there were separate student number quotas and international students simply weren't competing with UK/EU students for places.

On late goals he says, ""if Eriksen carries on at his current rate he will pass the flying Welshman with ease"". Eriksen's current rate is 3 in 25 games. Keeping up that same rate for the rest of the season would put him at 4.56 late goals, which isn't even higher than Bale's 5 for the 12/13 season, let alone passing him with ease.

The author has also decided to use the relative change in our league position if you removed Eriksen or Bale's points from our current and 12/13 totals because that's the only way that shitty stat even fits his perspective.

As others have pointed out it's a pretty meaningless thing to look at anyway, but if you take Eriksen's rate of 13 points won in 25 games and extrapolate it across a full season, you get him winning us a total of just 19.76 points, significantly less than the 24 points Bale supposedly won for us in 12/13.

But outside of London, there's really no stigma against immigrants in the legal professions. People in the legal professions tend to be highly educated and intelligent. Highly educated people are far less likely to be prejudiced in general. 

In any case, much of the friction between immigrants and others comes from the (usually false) impression that cheap immigrant labour is undercutting local workers. The high barrier to entry for most legal professions prevents that ever being an issue. Anyone acting as a solicitor in the UK will have gone through the same or similar education and training as I have, which takes years of work.

The focus on proof of posting tends to come from a reading of the [Interpretation Act 1978](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1978/30). This allows Govt and other public services (esp. the Courts) to assume that if a document has been posted (e.g. a court summons) it is accepted that it's arrived as intended, in the timescale intended, unless the recipient can prove it didn't arrive.

Proving a letter didn't arrive is clearly very difficult, unless you get a statement from your postman saying they clearly remember not delivering something.

Here's the text, it's Section 7:
&gt; Where an Act authorises or requires any document to be served by post (whether the expression “serve” or the expression “give” or “send” or any other expression is used) then, unless the contrary intention appears, the service is deemed to be effected by properly addressing, pre-paying and posting a letter containing the document and, unless the contrary is proved, to have been effected at the time at which the letter would be delivered in the ordinary course of post.

So if you are legally required to return documents by post under an Act of Parliament, or if a public service only gives you the option of returning documents by post, there's a good argument that the public are also entitled to rely on the provisions of this Act. It's up to the recipient (e.g. DVLA or Job Centre) to then prove that the letter you claim to have posted never arrived (which as noted is very difficult to do).

Some public bodies try to get around this by arguing that it's delivery, not posting, that is required in which case hand-delivery or recorded might be sensible.

I would be pushing back to the Job Centre by quoting the Interpretation Act 1978 S.7 and telling them that registered delivery is not required; ask them to prove that the document was not received (which they won't be able to do). They will probably push back but it's a good starting point - you can then ask them to show you where it's explicitly required that proof of delivery is required, and if it's not the legislation you'll have a decent claim against them.

If you think about it even registered delivery doesn't help - all that proves is an envelope was received, it doesn't guarantee what's in the envelope; nothing to stop the Job Centre saying it was full of junk mail.  Only way to fully cover yourself is to get an independent witness to watch you put the paperwork into the envelope, then walk with you to the post office while you send it... most courts would consider that unreasonable.

I accept it's not your duty to provide public seating. Sometimes shop owners lobby the council to remove existing seating outside their shop. And they prevail. That's partly why so much of it was removed. 

EDIT: If you're talking about the skallies that gather outside corner shops in the evening, that's another matter. 

Curiously, a lot of this removal of public seating in city centres appears to have taken place starting in the 1990s. This is the same decade that saw the rise of the international superbrand cafe chain, such as Starbucks, Costa and Nero's. Only a cynic would see this as any more than coincidence, of course. But with public seating scarce, or lacking a backrest, what are weary shoppers to do except sit down in one of the many conveniently located superbrand cafe chains that sorting to mind. They are not always primarily interested in the coffee. 

You are right. The council's job is to provide seating, though that's not all your taxes go for.   In some cases, however, they have been removing seating at public expense to suit individual businesses who don't like their location. 

There is a legitimate private interest here, but the problem is that it conflicts with the legitimate public interest, which it is the duty of public bodies to preserve. For whatever reason, they have not always done so. 

It was the Victorians who brought in this business of public parks and public seating all for the common good. There was a time when a nice wooden bench with a back rest was never far too seek anywhere in our city centres. With the pressure suitably relieved from ledges outside department stores, nobody needed spikes, or bevelled edges, or strategically placed ""handrails"".

All that has changed. It's hard not to suspect that it represents an illegitimate victory for organised private interest over the public good. 

BTW: You may well pay your taxes, but that does not appear to be the case with, for example, our friends Starbucks. You might want to have a word with them, or with HMRC, or with your candidates in this election season. The tax regime needs to change. It's just economics.

Only tangentially related. The courts decided that tenancies that were created before the deposit scheme legislation came into force had to be protected when that tenancy became periodic. 

There was financial penalty in the same way there would be if a landlord doesn't comply with the legislation at all, now. But they couldn't service a section 21 notice.

There were a few interpretations of this, some people think that this mean landlords should re-protect the deposit when a tenancy became periodic, other believed that the implication was that a new tenancy was created every 30 days. 

A lot of places advised landlords to be cautious (which I believe you know from reading landlordzone)

I don't follow legislation closely any more, so can't tell you if it has come into force, but the government decided to amend the legislation surrounding the implications from Superstrike Ltd v Rodrigues. When this comes into force (if it has - at work now so can't spend a lot of time researching) Landlords are fine as long as the deposit has been protected at the start of the tenancy. If the tenancy began before 2007 then the landlord must protect the deposit within 3 months.

Re. your situation now, find a solicitor. This is beyond CAB and the shelter advice line. WeaponizedKissing's advice in the thread on /r/UKPersonalFinance is good, some here and over there isn't taking into account that you've not actually paid the landlord any deposit, you've paid the outgoing tenant.

[diamorphine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamorphine) *is* heroin (usually from a full synthetic source) but this is rarely mentioned in the press because your Gran being injected with heroin for an operation or other pain relief does not fit with the government approved narrative that everyone who touches heroin will become a lifetime addict.

NXEC had different obligations to East Coast. As I said in a different comment, it's hard to call East Coast successful when it's able to rewrite the franchise agreement to its benefit and carry on. NXEC made commitments based on pre-recession assumptions and decided that they couldn't carry on. East Coast got a fresh start (as would any private bidder, if they got the chance) and unsurprisingly does a bit better. 

FGW did a similar thing, their franchise had the option to extend for 2 years automatically if they wanted it, but knew that the franchise agreement was not written with the future in mind (it was written before the government decided to electrify London to Bristol and new trains) and they wanted one that was. So they refused the option and got a new temporary agreement for the next few years

http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Built-Environment/Housing/BuyingSelling/Home-Report/buyers/advice

&gt; The Home Report legislation gives buyers a statutory right to damages if the Single Survey report is prepared in a way which is negligent or biased. The surveyor therefore has a legal liability to both the seller who instructed it and the buyer, and will write the survey report with both parties in mind. Surveyors are bound by complaint and redress systems including the independent Surveyor Ombudsman Scheme.

However, things are never that clear in these cases... one of 3 situations is likely:

1) The surveyor was told about it, but didn't think it was that bad so didn't document it. Buyer has to prove that it is serious enough to justify a claim of negligence against surveyor.

2) The seller claims they never had any damp problems, and never knew of any issues.  That's what they told surveyor. Now buyer has to prove they 'covered it up' by getting statements from neighbours etc.

3) There really wasn't a damp problem, as the sellers claim - or at least there were no signs of it until after the buyer moved in.    The sellers weren't being dishonest, and the surveyor didn't notice any signs when surveying.  Buyer has to show negligence of surveyor in not doing a proper survey, or of sellers for not mentioning (if they knew) that their neighbours had a damp problem on an adjoining wall).

You get pretty much the Visa exchange rate, which is more or less bang on the actual exchange rate. Your bank may charge you (depending on what bank you're with, typically they charge about 5% and have charged that cap out at certain values. I found it was best to withdraw money in £100 batches. I know there are some banks that do not charge anything for foreign transactions though). 

It still works out better than buying in the UK though; the actual rate was something like 5.1-5.2 PLN per GBP at the time, the post office were willing to sell me 4.6 PLN per GBP (unless I was buying more than £1000 or something stupid), and using my debit card I was able to withdraw ~5.0 PLN per GBP from am ATM in the middle of Krakow as and when I needed it. 

Just make sure you withdraw in the local currency; I think you'll get hit with another layer of transaction fee if you convert to GBP at the ATM you withdraw from. And check if you plan on doing this. I think it mainly applies to EU countries (it is probably bank-specific) and banks charge different rates. About 2 minutes of Googling should bring up the costs of banking abroad for your bank.

I think a large number of people over 50 see it as being for the 'underclass' and 'benefit scroungers'. 

The other side of the coin are the new-age 'spiritual' types who also seem to be very vocal about legalisation. I could see how someone who reads the Daily Mail could assume that cannabis rots your mind and turns you into a spaced-out hippy. 

I actually think the latter group are a large part of why 'normal' cannabis users distance themselves from it. Cannabis culture is embarrassing. It ranges from telling people that cannabis cures AIDS, to playing up to the dumb stoner stereotype.

It was around the time of the transfer window threads where going about and suggested we should go after Klopp.  My biggest frustration with Rodgers is his stubbornness and he reminds me a lot of Wenger in that regard. 

We were playing absolute awful football for most of the season.  Everyone could see why and Brendan just continuing with the same. You can get away with playing awful football if you are winning, for the most part but when your not you can't. 

What I suggested at the time, and I still stand by this, is to get a new No 2 or coach whos more experienced.  Someone who I feel would question him and I dont get that impression of Pascoe. I do believe hes a good manager, not fantastic, as the first half of the season as shown us. We also have big question marks over is transfer dealings. Most of them I hope come good as most them have shown glimpses.

During are awful time I said he undid a lot of his good work from last year in the space of 3 - 4 months.  I still stand by what I said at the time that during that period was my worse watching Liverpool even under Hodgson! Maybe it was due to the contrast of the football from the season previous. 

We are back to good form and playing good football again.  The big question which cant be answered yet is has his stubbornness at the beginning of the season cost us the champions league place. 

Rodgers got us playing the best football I have ever seen us play last season.  I looked forward to every single match and believed we could win them all. Rodgers also had us playing the worse football I ever seen us play. I maintained at the time, despite the joking of sorts, he should be given some more time. However I do think the game which saved his Liverpool career was the Capital One game against Bournemouth. 

Hopefully this is the start of some stability and he will have lots of success. As when his teams play they are very very good and when they are bad they very very bad. He is out of the woods now but they can still be seen. 

This seems to be overly negative which I didnt intend. I was fleeting over to he must go and can admit it.

3 points. 3 points is all that matters. We were winning last year, climbing the table and tearing teams to threads. And being entertained like nobodies business.

Winning things is the only thing that matters. The ethos of this club has been that since it came into existance.

null,false,Sir_Psycho_Sexy_,lfcflame,,null,"&gt; 3 points. 3 points is all that matters. We were winning last year, climbing the table and tearing teams to threads. And being entertained like nobodies business

but if our defence was better in other games we would have gained more points, no? Hull away, our inability to deal with setpieces, multiple errors from defence and little cohesion as a unit and we might have picked up more points. We've improved on these aspects recently.

&gt; Listen, we would have won the league last year, and no one would have ever said 'look they're so imbalanced'

but we didn't win the league, and the one of the reasons was lack of balance. The only other time I remember a team doing what we did, was Ferguson's last season when he bought RvP and blitzed the competition and even in that season, the nearest competitor, City, were very poor.

&gt; At the end of the day, unless you win stuff, improvement will count for absolutely nothing.

I don't understand you. By improving, we increase our chances at winning things. If we had started this season in the way we've been playing in the last month and a bit, we would be doing very well in the league. Is it a surprise to you we are in the quarters of the FA cup and very likely to make it to the semis and then go on and win it? Or that we made the semis of the league cup and could have potentially beaten Chelsea had Sturridge been fit for us? Seeing as we played very well against them y'know.

So, by making improvement to our weak areas, and that was quite obviously our defence, and then still getting the 3 points, are we not then in a better position to go on and succeed? Because let me tell you, what we did last season against most of the teams we faced, would not have taken us to the latter stages of the Champions League. We might have got goals against the top teams but if you can't defend then you'll get exploited.

I would also point out that you are suffering from an understandable conformation bias; history does indeed show that governments can abuse the minorities in their country and abuse powers given to them such as limiting free speech but it is easy to forget that it is not always the case. Because of the nature of persecution and genocide and the like it is much more dramatic than its opposite (peaceful coexistence) and thus more easily remembered.

null,false,Kitchner,null,null,null,"While I appreciate you may genuinely be seeking to discuss this, as in get two sides of a debate, this generally won't happen on Reddit. 

In almost every instance I've ever discussed or seen drug legalisation discussed, nearly everyone on Reddit is in favour of decriminalisation or legalisation and anyone who disagrees gets heavily downvoted.

I don't agree with legalisation, and my views on decriminalisation are complicated as I think minor drug possession isn't the only crime which can fuck up someone's life with a criminal record, so I don't think it's a ""drugs only"" issue. However, there's not much point in me explaining my position.

I mean there are 47 comments on this page in 5 hours, and already the even relatively anti-drugs messages are downvoted to the bottom. 

EDIT: As a couple of people have asked, I'll lay out my point of view, which definitely isn't in line with people's points of view on Reddit in general. 

I'm not against legalising anything if it can be proven that it shouldn't be illegal any longer, and I'm not opposed to banning anything by law if it can be proved that we should. I also don't really believe in changing the status quo without a good reason. So my arguments for not legalising weed aren't really ""reasons to ban it"" but rather ""reasons why I don't agree with the arguments to legalise it"".

So point 1 that is usually raised is that if you legalise weed it will reduce crime. I totally agree this would happen, and you already see it in countries where they have decriminalised drug use. However, if you decriminalise say, GBH, you'll see a drop in violent crimes too. By definition, if you legalise something that was previously illegal, you will reduce crime. There is an argument to say that people steal to fund their drug habits, which is true and as a result thefts may decrease, but then it's also argued that weed isn't addictive (which I will get to). I don't believe most drug related thefts are to do with weed, I'd be happy to change my mind if anyone had data that said otherwise though.

So this argument can equally be applied to any other law. If you legalise public nudity crime will decrease if nothing else because all the arrests last year for indecent exposure would no longer have happened. Therefore, for the reasons above, I don't think that the argument it will reduce crime is a valid one, as people generally do not suggest this as a valid reason to do a whole bunch of other things.

Point 2 is usually that since you can't stop people doing it, you might as well control it. This argument is similar to above in the way that this is not why laws are written. Laws against embezzlement aren't there because it stops embezzlement, they are there to discourage it, to punish those caught doing it, and to reflect the society we live in which frowns upon embezzlement as an activity (yes you can say society doesn't frown upon cannabis use, but that's a separate point for later).

Again, as you can apply this argument to any law and any crime, I don't think it's a valid argument.

Point 3 is that you can make money by legalising cannabis. The reasons for me disagreeing with this is in two parts. The first the the same as the above points, that it can be applied to any law, yet it never is by those who support it for weed. The second is that there's no definitive evidence that long term and widespread use of cannabis doesn't result in increased healthcare costs. In the UK an increased burden on the NHS could hypothetically wipe out any gains from taxing cannabis sales. I'm not saying it would, I'm just saying I wouldn't want to definitively say ""It will make us money"" without knowing that it definitely will. 

Point 4 is that weed is less harmful than smoking and alcohol, and both those are allowed. I'll handle these in two parts because I think they highlight separate issues. 

Smoking, I would  LOVE to be able to just say yeah let's ban it. It's a crutch used by people to relax when really they should (ideally) be able to cope with their lives without needing a cigarette. It's addictive, and it costs the NHS millions a year in treating the effects of it. However, smoking was introduced and became popular before people were aware of the side effects. Thanks to big tobacco companies, they helped suppress academic research into the harm of cigarettes for decades. Furthermore, tobacco companies still abuse the fuck out of third world countries that threaten to introduce measures like indoor smoking bans and plain packaging that has been successful in cutting smoking rates. The problem is we can't just out right ban cigarettes because: a) it would leave a gaping whole in the budget in the short term, b) smokers are voters too, and banning cigarettes will piss them off to no end, this is a democracy after all, c) tobacco companies lobby governments to prevent this shit all the time. 

I don't want to live in a world 20 years from now where there are widely accepted negative effects of widespread cannabis use, but we can't do shit about it because of the power of the cannabis lobby and the number of cannabis smokers in the UK who don't know what's good for them.

As for alcohol, it's often cited as a point in favour of legalising weed, but I actually think it's a point against it. Smoking a joint once in a while has no negative effects, we can all agree on that. Drinking a pint of beer once in a while has no negative effect, we can all agree on that too. However, Britain has a huge binge drinking problem, which causes liver cancer, costs to the NHS, social problems, and harm to those involved. This is because it is socially acceptable now to go out and binge on alcohol, possibly to avoid thinking about how miserable life can be or in order to relax. I don't see how weed would be any different, there would be no self restraint for a lot of people, just over use. Reducing the price and increasing availability will increase the supply and more people will partake. As per my smoking point, I believe we will see in the US big companies selling cannabis forming, and they will do what the tobacco companies did and what alcohol companies do now, get people into the idea of buying as much weed as possible. 

I don't know about you, but I've known people who were heavy, regular smokers and I don't think it had any positive effects on them, so I don't like this argument. Before you ask, do I agree with banning alcohol? Again, in principle yes, despite being a drinker. It would be good to live in a society where no one needs a drink in order to relax or feel social. Again though, there are a ton of things stopping us from doing that right now.

Point 5 is basically that weed isn't harmful. This is a bit contentious as academics on both sides of the argument can claim it is or isn't and we could spend weeks finding a variety of peer reviewed sources for both sides. As such I don't feel either side is able to claim scientific certainty on whether or not it's harmful. So I fall back on my own, personal experiences, and nearly everyone I know who took part in weed regularly did not benefit from it. Their memories were effected, they were less productive, and it became a big thing in their life. Weed may not be chemically addictive, but like anything you can mentally end up leaning on it as a crutch to support yourself.

Finally, Point 6 is that it should be decriminalised because people arrested with minor amounts of weed on them face criminal charges that ruin their lives.  I agree this is disgraceful, as mistakes breaking the law as a teenager shouldn't rule you out of a good job when you're 28 or whatever. People who use drugs should get support to help them stop using, they should be *rehabilitated* a word not used enough in the UK. I think this doesn't apply to just drug use though. A guy gets into a bar fight, gets arrested, thats a criminal record and now no employer will hire him. Is he helped? No, he's thrown into jail with criminals, who will tell him he's got no future on the outside now and instead train him to be a better criminal.

The entire UK justice system is about 100 years out of date. The focus should be on taking members of society and, in some sort of fashion, make them into contributing citizens not inclined to reoffend. So I don't agree with decriminalisation per se, as that implied it's no longer a criminal offence to carry an illegal drug. Instead I want it to remain a criminal offence, but radically alter how we treat criminals in the UK.

Anyway, that's my very long and probably boring opinions. I could probably write more but I think that's a good place to stop. there's no TL;DR sorry, because I don't think it's a topic you can sum up in a sentence.

Firstly, I think you own you ledge and can ask people not to sit there at the risk of offending potential customers, but shop owners also have to get used to the fact that they don't own the public space on the footpath outside their shop. For example, if someone were to just stand there  on the footpath smoking a cigarette, that's his right, but if would still conflict with your interest. Nobody owes you an unobstructed view to your window from all angles. 

Secondly, it's hard for me to think that people, no matter how unreasonable, would chose your meagre ledge over well-placed, purpose built seating, with back rest, in such large numbers and with such frequency that it would cause a  significant loss of sales. What I'm saying is, for some reason people are choosing your ledge over public seating nearby, so the incentives to chose the latter could be improved by an improvement in the seating. 

Which way is the seating facing? Does it have a back? Is it conveniently located? 

If all these things are sorted, they would be less likely to choose your ledge. 

What if the council were to put a seat right outside your shop facing the street? You wouldn't like that, but if it's on public space you ought to lump it in my view. Public space is for public people and private interest has to be subordinated to public interest in a civic society. 

Part of the the problem is that you will go to the council to complain about your little patch as an individual with very much more vigour than any of the individuals whose collective interest is being diminished by the lack of public seating. 

If your town really is replete with well-situated and inviting seating in easy reach throughout the centre, then I take all this back.

#Explanations, caveats and answers to common questions. 
**The level of unemployment is not calculated from the number of people on out-of-work benefits** so sanctions or the actions of job centres will not affect it. These figures are based on a survey called the Labour Force Survey which samples around 40-45 thousand people every quarter. There are unemployed who are not entitled to out-of-work benefits  (e.g. those with a large household income due to a spouse, those with large savings, or those on sanctions) and there are people who claim JSA but are not unemployed (e.g. those who work less than a certain number of hours or fraudsters), so the two are not the same. The number of people claiming out-of-work benefits is reported separately as the Claimant Count. (See above for those figures)

Zero-hour contracts are not regularly measured (they were measured once in Apr-Jun 2014 at 2% of employment or 1.0% of full time and 4.9% of part time), however there is some regular measure of “underemployment”  by measuring those who are in part-time work but wish to be in full-time work. People self-select whether they are full time or part time. Equally those on temporary contracts who wish to be permanent are counted. (See above for these figures)

The rate of unemployment is an economic measure of spare labour in the workforce not a political measure of how well a government is doing at making sure everyone is happy with their job situation. As such, those on workfare, government training programmes or unpaid internships are not counted as unemployed; they do not currently have spare labour to add to the economy. However those on “Government supported training &amp; employment programmes” are reported separately so you may recast the figures should you wish. (See above for these figures) 

The definition of unemployment requires someone to be actively seeking work in the last four weeks and able to start work in the next two weeks. Those who are out of work and say they want a job but don’t meet this definition are reported separately under Inactive. Note that the Inactive category is only for 16-64 year olds. (See above for these figures)

The figures are calculated by the independent Office of National Statistics based on internationally agreed conventions. The government cannot interfere with the calculation of the figures or set the way in which they are calculated. However knowing how the numbers are calculated does mean governments can set policy accordingly and create targets which may not be in the best interest of the public. 

The numbers are seasonally adjusted, so there should be no effect from things such as Christmas jobs.

Given that the numbers are based on a survey, the figures can never be perfectly accurate and there is a margin of error, e.g. the 95% confidence interval for the unemployment rates is ± 0.2%. The numbers should be seen as approximate and are best understood in terms of the trends they show over time.

Items highlighted with * have more recent data available, so I have used these data instead, and used the same offset for the historic columns to maintain comparability.

Really ""bullshit"" is not much elevated above ""cunt"" and neither word proves anything. That's my point. I'm not being stupid. You're being vulgar. I'm being quite intelligent. Why don't you join me?

As for whether you believe me, that's entirely up to you. I'm not going to get upset if you don't. I can't make you believe me. All I can do is tell you the truth. I know it's true because I have taken a fairly massive cut to my income for the sake of doing something more worthwhile and directed towards the common good in the past. Furthermore, unlike you, I don't doubt that this is normal. Human beings are basically quite a decent lot. The problem may lie with a system of private profit which motivates businesses to act like psychopaths without regard for anything except themselves. 

I'm sure that, left to your own devices as a human individual, you would take a pay cut for the sake of others sometimes too. Why wouldn't you. 

You might have learned all this from me in the first place if you hadn't been so vulgar. Using words like ""bullshit"" makes me think you're a bit of a skally yourself, trying to prove what a big man you are. Then ""cunt"" would do just fine. See how it works?

Government protected minorities because it was popular and in future thanks to precedent and mandate people like yourself are advocating for it can persecute again, I hope it doesn't. 

Another way of looking at it.. We always talk about protecting minorities from public but what about protecting them from government? Maybe not now but 100 years? 150 years? We got it wrong with blacks, women, LGBT.. 

Another point: enforcement of law is threat of and in some cases actual violence. Using that against people for simply being racist (for example) is immoral.

null,false,lancashire_lad,null,null,null,"Someone else already asked me this and I said I'd reply more extensively at the weekend when I have more time. I will give a short response here, but won't have much time for a back and forth. I feel there are a multitude of reasons, but for me the strongest ones are:

1) Trade access.

While the EU is currently 40-45% of our exports, this is falling rapidly. The EU is both (a) demographically declining and (b) locked in a poorly functional currency and a liquidity trap that it does not have the political capabilities to overcome. The conditions of EU membership prevents us from signing trade deals with both higher growth economies (the BRICs and MINTs) and higher productivity economies (Canada, USA, Australia) without unanimous EU agreement, and that agreement is highly difficult to get. We would get 90% of the trade access to the EU via a bilateral trade deal along the lines of the EU-Korea deal, but would also be able to sign deals on our own terms with other nations, for better global market access overall.

2) There is a tremendous regulatory burden of being in the EU. While some of these regulations are sensible ones that we should maintain in our law after leaving, many are not. The Common Agricultural Policy is an obviously damaging one which completely unnecessarily raises food costs for our citizens, something that is particularly harmful for those on the lowest wages. There are also a great many product regulations that are excessive that could also be removed. While we would still need to keep these excessive regulations for exports to the EU, we would not have to for our domestic economy or for exports elsewhere, which would help our economy.

3) Disengagement with democracy and governance. 

Currently, the EU is highly undemocratic in many of its structures, and there also seems to be a mentality of disdain for popular sentiment among EU types (see the various ""elections don't matter"" quotes, the ignoring of the Dutch and French referenda, the removal of the Greek and Italian PMs). Also, even if democratic structures were put in place and the elite was changed to a more democratic minded one, I think it is unrealistic to get the people of this country to identify primarily as Europeans and follow political debate on a continent-wide basis. This is particularly the case when it contains nations of different political cultures, mentalities and assumptions. On top of this, the EU allows our own politicians try to avoid being responsible for policies because they blame it on the EU-level, even when they supported it themselves in the EU discussions. It also binds future governments who wish to reverse policies agreed at the EU level because topics will not be opened again once they are 'settled' for a decade or so. The whole combined effect turns people off politics and makes for an unhealthy democratic culture.

4) Immigration.

I am supportive of immigration and think it can positively help our economy and society. However, I feel that current rates of immigration are just too fast for us to adjust to the effects. Living in London, I see first-hand how transport infrastructure and housing can not be built fast enough, how there aren't enough GP surgeries and school places to keep up with the increasing population. The impact is higher housing costs, increased congestion, and poorer service levels in public services. I believe we would benefit more as a country if we had a points system for European migration, so that skilled workers with employment can still come here easily, but minimum wage workers that compete with our own working class are more limited.

5) The pure financial cost.

The EU currently costs us about £10 billion a year directly, and maintains control over another £10 billion a year that comes back to us on EU projects but could be spent much more effectively on our own priorities. This saving is a valuable one in a time of deficit reduction.",null,0,null,1424261768,null,0,false,0,cop4y0a,null,t3_2w7qm9,null,t1_cop4y0a,null,t1_cop2ilw,null,null,null,1424655074,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

However, don't EU rules prevent this happening? Only three EU countries (UK, Ireland and Malta) have zero rate VAT and the UK had to fight to prevent the removal of the zero rate of clothes for kids (and if we ever did want to tax them because they aren't in the list they'd have to be taxed at 20%). The EU doesn't like reduced and zero rate VAT for many reasons and their  rules appear to prevent adding new items to the list of zero-rated items.

I'm happy to be corrected, especially since there's a lot of legislation to go through, but it seems to me we should also be petitioning MEPs since they have power here. But then due to there only being three member states who actually use zero-rate it seems very unlikely to happen.

Tampons are included in the EU's list of items that can be at a reduced rate, and they are in the UK, being taxed at 5% not 20%. Which is something, especially given somewhere like Denmark that doesn't even have a reduced rate, just the standard 25%.

A desire to leave the EU and to change immigration policies doesn't make it a racist party. It is a legitimate party in the UK, and I say that as someone who doesn't agree much with them. It has more MEPs than any other UK party and has recently won 2 seats in the House of Commons and will almost certainly gain more in May. To reduce that party to simply ""a deeply racist party"" ignores far too much and appears quite ignorant. But then when your counter to that party is a sticker saying 'Fuck UKIP' and your issue is whether or not you should maintain or remove a letter you can't really expect much.

Shaking up and change can be provided in a nationalised service by appointing and rotating competent people while making smart long term investments.

You honestly saying that the Tories in particular aren't demonising being poor and unemployed because what they have done to the benefits system and wages since they came to power almost seems like a deliberate act to create this very scenario.

NHS privatisation is not systemic at all.

What on earth... It's confusing so it's a moot point? Where the logic in that. Obviously the tories can't fix it or they would have by now.

I'm not saying any one party can necessarily do better but I am saying the tory government has had 5 years and only made it worse so they have had their shot and to pretend all the fuck ups they have made don't exist or need to be ignored is just the most ridiculous disconnection from reality combined with political bias I've heard.

One of them sacrificing even a single regeneration (and knowing that not only their looks but also their personality could change completely) is far too selfless an act for what the Time Lords became. 

With the events shown in the End of Time episodes, the Time Lords were willing to destroy everything in the universe, ceasing even the march of time itself, to win.  They had an out - they were going to become beings of pure energy or thought or something.  This, to them, was not a sacrifice but the ultimate win - there would be nothing left but Time Lord consciousness, forever and ever.  How very Dalek, no?

The rogue Time Lords - the Doctor, for example, were the ones who thought against the growing corpulence of the Time Lord society.  Some of them are good(ish), some are bad, but they're *better* than the bulk of Time Lord society because they can think outside that.  Even the Master.

- much regulation will need to be observed anywhere to continue to trade (again - not an option to stop trading) - the norway complaint is that it has no say in these regulations because of its status, but has to worry about them anyway. 

- everyone always assumes that EEA or EFTA arrangement is a reasonable swap in for true free market - but this is only true for big businesses. Small and medium sized business trade to europe would be decimated if we left the free market because the alternatives are nowhere near as frictionless. i've never met anyone that trades across borders that is not seriously concerned about this part. 

- as above - we wouldn't actually get to keep all our 'fees' if we want to continue to trade.   ",null,0,null,1424266508,null,0,false,0,cop6btp,null,t3_2w7qm9,null,t1_cop6btp,null,t1_cop4y0a,null,null,null,1424655721,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

My experience with the NHS has been that in the first instance you'll get referred to a community psychiatric nurse. Whether that's helpful or not depends on what the problem is. Some of my friends have gone to them to work through mild depression, addiction, tough times in their lives and they've benefited a lot from the services on offer. I found it less useful because I needed someone who specialised in Complex PTSD, so I kept asking to be referred on and eventually they sent me to a psychotherapist at the Royal Edinburgh. 

Basically, OP, persevere. It might take you a few tries to get to where you need to be within NHS services.

The direct quote from the article in regards:

&gt;There are some funds in existence which do that type of work and that is something that strategically we regard as one of the roles of the institution

This information of the OO land funds was provided in relation to the report on so-called ""colour coding"", the practice of denying sale to another person because of their associated religion.

His situation at Liverpool is entirely different from what he's into at Barca now to the point where a comparison is almost laughable.  If you put Messi on last season's Liverpool team then Suarez never would have had the season he ended up having, the glory would have gone to Messi.

Ultimately with Suarez at Barca you're seeing 3 things: The first is the Messi factor.  He's just flat out head and shoulders above everyone else, period.  Of course he's the focal point for everyone, including Suarez.  The second is that Suarez is on a new team, with new teammates, and coming off of a huge ban.  He's going to take time to get going again and he's always started slowly when moving leagues.  The third is the players around him are all a cut above what we're currently got at Liverpool, so Messi or no there's a lot less individual repsonsibility on Suarez to make things happen.  Think of it as more of a trust thing, Suarez was insanely selfish at times last season and although more often than not he could make magic from nothing, there were also plenty of misses that he should have moved the ball on instead of have a go himself.  

Yes, Rodgers did really well to bring the best out of Suarez, to create an environment that capitalizes fully on his strengths and to reel him back in after all the transfer shenanigans of the 2013 summer window.  He deserves credit for that, and he receives credit for that constantly.

They went for the right one, Eric Pickles, but the sticking point is that in 2011 while they were asking for a CPO, the club and Haringey were discussing changes to the proposal (bigger stadium + more redevelopment) without, according to Archway's QC, the SofS's knowledge. 

Justice Dove can only ask the SofS to reconsider the CPO with all the info at hand - this is where it gets quashed if the SofS wishes to do so. The QC representing the state said yesterday that the SofS has known all along that the plans might change and is aware of the changes already planned. Additionally, it already has the backing of the borough and the Mayor of London, so Justice Dove might conclude that the SofS will reach the same conclusion again and that dragging this around in court any longer is to too much of a public expense just in court costs + holding up a beneficial project like this isn't in the interest of the community as a whole and will just uphold the decision of the CPO. 

But yes, as you say, if it has to be reconsidered and gets quashed then we are looking at quite a bit more money to be spent on Archway's land and several years of legal battles added to it.

This is a pretty poor argument as you can use it for every single crime in the UK. People are going to do it anyway, so why bother? Why not educate them and charge them for it with a tax?

Why not set a speed limit and educate drivers why it's important, but then let them pay a £5 speeding fee if they want to break the speed limit by up to 20mph for a day.

Why not legalise it so people are free to choose not to wear helmets or seat belts on/in their vehicles? Educate them and let them pay a ""No helmet/seatbelt tax"".

These will also reduce crime rates, as suddenly hardly anyone is illegally speeding and no-one is breaking the law by riding without a helmet. However both these bans have significant impacts on public health, specifically the NHS which you are clearly a supporter of. Every person injured through speeding or through not wearing a helmet or seatbelt is a cost anyway, not to mention the impact it has on their family if they die.

Well I hope the below explanations help you to understand. 


&gt;You honestly saying that the Tories in particular aren't demonising being poor and unemployed because what they have done to the benefits system and wages since they came to power almost seems like a deliberate act to create this very scenario.

I would firstly remind of the recession and the country’s huge deficit, cuts had to be made. In fact cuts were planned before the crisis by Labour as by their own admission spending was too high. “*the Labour government was planning a fiscal
tightening to reduce borrowing to 1.3%*” [IFS 2015]( http://www.ifs.org.uk/uploads/gb/gb2015/ch1_gb2015.pdf). So cuts were planned before the crisis by Labour and after were then vastly recalculated and increased by both sides. Now in this election both parties are singed up to austerity, we simply have a choice of how much to cut, a £25Bn choice as that is the difference between Labour and the Tories plans. Both parities are making the same cuts the Tories just go further as they which to achieve a budget surplus.

&gt;NHS privatisation is not systemic at all.

Then why has it continued regardless of who has been in power? 

&gt;What on earth... It's confusing so it's a moot point? Where the logic in that.

The logic is simply this, before you change something you must understand it and in this new world of enhanced globalization and rapid technological advancement that is not something easily done.  


“*If you think of it, children starting school this year will be retiring in 2065. Nobody has a clue, despite all the expertise that's been on parade for the past four days, what the world will look like in five years' time. And yet we're meant to be educating them for it. So the unpredictability, I think, is extraordinary*” (Ken Robinson)

This is not helped by the fact that in 10 years we have had 6 Education sectaries, there is no coherent vision and changing every 2 years isn’t going to help that.


&gt;I'm not saying any one party can necessarily do better but I am saying the tory government has had 5 years

5 years. Exactly, legislation takes time to pass, amend means test and implement. I have heard it said that often governments leave office before much of their work is ever realised. 

&gt;all the fuck ups they have made don't exist

On the whole I would say this coalition government has worked a miracle, it has functioned, brought stability and seen us through some very difficult times. 

&gt;It's all very well to want to vote tory for your own reasons but when you start making up reality you don't have a good point for arguing that it's the moral thing to do.

Making up reality. Right, I haven’t.

Big Business want governement media that is as weak as possible. Why is why we are seeing an assault on governement media all around the world. In Canada, they accuse CBC of ""leftism"" because CBC investigates and attacks climate change denila, in the US they want to cut PBS which was one of the only channel to talk to americans about the TPP,  in the UK they attack the BBC, in France they want more of the budget to depend on the advertising.

Frankie Boyle has consistently said that HE wants to do political satire etc and that its the TV people who won't let him. Maybe I didn't put that point across clearly enough, but its not my building expectations out of thin air, he has consistently said he wants to do better stuff than celeb baiting. But when he had full creative control of his own TV show 'Tramadol Nights' and when he does his own live stand-up, he still does the same stuff, none of the cutting satire on issues he was being prevented from talking about, to paraphrase his own words. Its not my preference, its not my expectations, its straight from the horse's mouth, do you get that point?

He has literally said words to the effect of ""I want to do more political, social, cultural satire but people in control of TV don't want that"", yet when he does his own stuff with full creative control, whether on TV or live, he does the same stuff he's always done.

My problem is that he has created this myth, where he's some sort of shackled genius, being prevented from putting the world to rights and being limited to writing jokes about Jordan marrying a cage fighter to stop Harvey from fucking her (hilarious). He's a complete hypocrite and every time he writes about the quality of standards in the media/comedy, professes how he's not allowed to do anything but when he's given free reigns, he falls back onto his old stuff, people lap it up and it builds this myth.

That looks like a good basic routine, but I don't see any acne fighting actives. These include sodium ascorbyl phosphate (form of vitamin C), niacinamide, retinoids (vitamin A) and green tea extract. Check out [our ingredients Wiki] (http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionUK/wiki/ingredients) and the mega reviews threads (sidebar except [vitamin C] (http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionUK/comments/2vvj7h/the_vitamin_c_reviews/) which is brand new). Niacinamide and green tea extract are useful in reducing excess sebum production.

Do you use sunscreen spring through autumn (see sidebar for [official recommendations] (http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionUK/wiki/sunprotection))? Zinc oxide gives broad spectrum protection and is naturally antibacterial and soothing/ calming, can also help mattify the skin.

Also review your diet and lifestyle choices, ensuring you consistently meet or exceed ALL our government's recommendations for healthy eating and lifestyle. At this time of year and when using sunscreen oily fish is particularly important for the long chain omega-3s and bioavailable vitamin D (UK experts recommend up to four servings a week).

You don't need to drink a lot of water if you are eating enough low sugar fruits and non starchy vegetables - UK guidelines are *at least* five a day, but most countries advocate seven to nine in the full rainbow of colours. Lastly check out /r/skindietandnutrition/

Now, couple of ways around this. One, have someone simply carry the stuff in off a flight from the U.S. in person.  There are limits to what you're supposed to just bring in without declaring it, these are higher than postal limits. The chances of being checked are pretty much nil anyway. Two: under-declare to the shipping company.  There are two problems here, first, if the stuff is lost, you're not going to get its true value refunded, next, doing so is illegal of course.

null,false,thehippieeconomist,null,null,null,"Forget the naysayers here, there's plenty to do in this city - you just need to know where to look to keep up with what's going on.

The music scene is fantastic and vibrant in this city, and there is always at least one great gig going on weekly - to keep up with the local scene I recommend you check out BBC Introducing in Oxford - if you miss the aired show on the Saturday night you can easily catch up with it on the iPlayer. However if you wanted something with more regularity as someone hinted to earlier the Catweazel is a great night out, whilst the Bully host a Jazz night on Tuesdays that are always good fun (and free!), and I believe the Jericho Tavern regularly hosts Jazz or Blues on Mondays too. Also it's handy to keep up with what's going on at the O2 - whilst it's a really poor venue, it does occasionally have some awesome acts.

Beyond music we have plenty of other things to crack on with, from theatre acts to talks to other wacky things. Again it's just knowing what's on, to tackle this the great guys over at DailyInfo post a new podcast every Wednesday which promotes their favourite events to go to in the next week (Thursday-Thursday) - I thoroughly recommend checking this out and seeing if there's anything that takes your fancy.

Whilst we may not have any huge or big clubs to go to, there are usually some funky nights being hosted at some of these clubs. I recently went to one called Itchy Feet that was a swing night at Warehouse, it  was bloody great and completely different to the normal nights you have at Warehouse.

You may also be interested in film, and here you can find plenty of things going on from quirky indie films being shown at our indie cinemas (Ultimate Picture Palace on Cowley Road, or The Phoenix in Jericho) or cozy film nights at some bars such as Bar Tarifa. Just keep your ear to the ground and you can find something out there.

Sorry for the wall of text - it's just I work in this industry here and it frustrates me when people say there's nothing here, when that clearly just isn't the case.

While I don't partake in re-creative drugs and never have, I don't believe that we're solving issues by taking someone to court over a few ounces of Weed - you can get Weed in Prison and it doesn't stop dealer or the proceeds going to fund bigger crimes. For every one person who stops buying for personal consumption, there's 10 more waiting to buy. 

I know people personally who are fantastic people, insanely intelligent and have lots going for them, they could easily be in better positions than they are now.
