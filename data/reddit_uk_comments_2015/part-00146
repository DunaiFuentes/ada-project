Doesn't work like that. The only deposit the mortgage companies are interested in is the one where you write a cheque to your solicitor. 

Basically how it works is the house is say £100,000 and you want a mortgage of £75k so a deposit of £25k. You give your solicitor the £25k which they hold in their bank. The mortgage company and your solicitor then transfer £100k to the sellers solicitor. The mortgage company will not release the funds until they have notification from your solicitor that they have cleared funds for the deposit.

As for borrowing, very few if any mortgages will accept a deposit that is funded by borrowing.

I haven't dug into the Trussell Trust website yet so I haven't got the data for all the years discussed in this piece, so it this may be a fair point. However it is worth noting that in both the [2013-2014 stats](http://www.trusselltrust.org/stats) with 913,138 and the [first half of the 2014-2015 stats](http://www.trusselltrust.org/mid-year-stats-2014-2015) with 492,641 people, low income as a cause is at ~20% and with changes to benefits takes up a greater percentage than delaying of benefits. The changes to benefits category can include sanctions and also (I assume) those who have had benefit reductions from the conservative reforms, and this makes up ~15% in the 2013-2014 period and ~17% in the mid 2014-2015 period.

&gt; Polling for the [OECD](http://www.conservativehome.com/localgovernment/2014/03/fewer-people-are-going-hungry-than-under-labour.html) suggests that fewer people are going hungry than under the Labour Government.

Taking into account population growth it says there has been a drop of ~865,000 from ~6 million (9.8%) to ~5.2 million (8.1%), from 2007 to march 2014, in people who answered yes to the question 'Have there been times in the past 12 months when you did not have enough money to buy food that you or your family needed?'. This certainly seems to be a good figure but I find it hard to pin down its particular relevance in reference to this because of the lack of data to show any correlation to food bank access. According to quotations at the start of the article people using food banks has risen by 851,670 (to 913,138) from 2011 to march 2014 (a coincidentally similiar number to the decrease in 'yes' answers) so the most obvious assumption to me at this point is that people using food banks may make up a specific subset of those who would answer yes to this question, whilst a larger subset has experienced an improvement.

edit: Also it's worth noting I only took into account the numbers the Russell Trust reported, as I understand they don't represent all statistics on foodbank use in the UK.

Doctor Who during the Moffat/Smith benefitted from a slowly increasing US audience which was held back by the fact that Doctor Who was only available to watch on pay-TV of one sort or another.  It was on BBC America , which is a premium pay channel that you pay extra for and aired months after the UK, not sure how much because I only have basic cable.  Or they could have watched it on Amazon Prime Instant at $90/year, (but not any more), or Netflix $95/year.  Individuals may have their own way of having watched the show but most started out with the episode Rose and went on to watch the entire series up to whatever cut off point Amazon or Netflix had, which was still at least months or years behind the UK audience.  To say it took off internationally because of Moffat/Smith downplays all of those delaying circumstances.

For the actual South East (Kent, etc.), more effective use of HS1 would be a great start. No more differential fares, get everyone needing longer distance services onto HS1 to use the capacity that's there and free up capacity on the congested slower lines. If HS2 ends up with differential fares I will be rather angry — it will be a sign that they've completely missed the point.

There are a few bottlenecks that can probably be cleared up around the place. This is of course already being done at places like London Bridge and (less South-east-y but still worth mentioning) Reading. Doing work like this in more places would be good. Also of interest is building flyovers on flat junctions. It's amazing how much this affects capacity. This is being done on the South Western Main Line — there are rough plans for new flyovers at Woking and Basingstoke (for the Reading line), eliminating the biggest bottlenecks on that route. I know there are plenty of these bottlenecks in the rest of the south east; I don't know of any plans but that's only because I don't live on those lines! I think though that there is or will be a plan to clear up East Croydon's massive bottleneck, correct me if I'm wrong?

Yaya used to be able to storm from one end of the field to the other, and back again. For the past 2 years he has been complaining of muscle fatigue from simply working his legs into oblivion. At the world cup he could get a slow jog going at best.

He needed rest and he didn't get it, now he is physically incapable of going box to box every game, 40 games a season.
If i can see it why didn't pellegrini do anything about it? God only knows... Pellegrini should have played yaya as a CDM and told him to never get into the oppositions 1/3 unless the ball is just being recycled and give him the opportunity for a long shot.

Pellegrini should have utilised his strengths and minimised his weaknesses by playing him in the Xabi alonso role.
This would mean a whole change of system but yaya was so key to us for so long it would only make sense to shape the team around him (to some extent).

Not to say yaya isn't at fault because he most definately is. Up until this season he has been a lazy player yes, but he's more than made up for it in the goals he has scored/created and his retention of the ball.

This season he has not done that nobody is expecting 20 goals but if he isnt going to score goals, he needs to make sure he isn't conceding them.
His mind seems ti be elsewhere and he doesn't seem to genuinly commit himself unless he feels like it.

null,false,Muzer0,eng-hampshire,Hampshire,null,"Re rail fares. I agree, the existing fares structure is ridiculously complicated. But I have not yet seen a convincing alternative. The current fares structure has been around for a long time and has matured into quite a comprehensive system filling every niche of travel requirements quite well. Unfortunately, it's been the advertising that's lacking — without a single body to advertise all of rail travel (why don't ATOC do this under their National Rail brand?) the strong advertising of the choices we had under BR has been lost. I'm reminded of an old British Rail poster I saw recently in the National Rail Museum. Unfortunately, the photo I took of it didn't come out, so here's one I found scouring the internet, from an ad from an old magazine on Google Books: http://tim32.org/~muzer/fares.png . But bear in mind that (with the notable exception of advance tickets, which were a later invention) the fares structure back then was quite similar to what it is today.

So the main issues with the fares structure are the variety of routes and what you can and can't do with them, and the peak time restrictions. This is basically what accounts for the majority of variation and confusion (there is also advance tickets, but correct me if I'm wrong, I believe they're generally quite well-understood — the ones you buy online that come with a compulsory reservation and require you to travel on that one train). The time restrictions at the moment is a ridiculous situation, where the conditions of carriage require that the train operator advertises the peak restrictions to you, yet rarely in a ticket office or at a ticket machine will you be told (correct) information regarding these! Fixing this would be a good start, and I believe some steps have finally been taken recently towards doing so. The routeing is a bit more complicated — basically post-privatisation the old British Rail vague rule of ""any reasonable route"" was actually specified — so you can now look in a set of documents called the Routeing [sic] Guide and manually determine all possible reasonable routes, definitively (with some caveats and edge cases that aren't quite as well-defined). Unfortunately, that set of documents is ridiculously complicated and, again, not well-advertised even to staff. So realistically, this is mostly an issue of staff training. I think creating some electronic system to use the SAME DATA as the publicly-available version of the routeing guide, and tell you which routes you can and can't take, would be an excellent solution, and I'm surprised one hasn't come about yet.

One issue wrt routeing that came to mind recently was the general obscurity of many of the locations used. For example, on a recent journey I made from Southampton to Bletchley, the routes available were KEN OLYMPIA and +ANY PERMITTED. The latter is relatively self-explanatory (I do say relatively... but most people's idea of a reasonable route usually correlates with the Routeing Guide's, so there's no issue there). But ""KEN OLYMPIA""? Most people would have no idea if the train they want to get goes via Kensington Olympia or not, even if they know what it stands for! For the record, this requires you to change at Clapham Junction onto a Southern service to Bletchley directly*. I'm not quite sure how you'd fix this issue, though, aside from the method above — but who's to say a thing showing you all the routes you can travel on would even be useful? Hrm...

I agree with the rest of the rail-related points, though. Though I'm not entirely sure of the fare reductions one — I think a better way would be for the franchise to specify fare reductions, then for the private operators to acheive that through whatever means they see fit. Having effectively a tax on profits for rail operators only would be a bit odd, to say the least.

Because we just didn't really want to? We decided that it just wasn't a very good idea?

No, I think what we're seeing here is that there's a real glass ceiling in the Premier League. We can do well, but we don't match the top teams in money; the top four teams those years are mostly Arsenal, City, United, and Chelsea; Liverpool has snuck into the Champions League twice in that time, and we have once. Overall, though, it's a stable league, and that's largely because the finances are relatively stable. Without a global brand, a big stadium, and/or a very wealthy owner, we don't have the resources to break into the top four consistently. 

Overall, I think we've done about as well as we could reasonably expect for the years above. One could obviously point to certain moments and say ""We should have bought this player,"" or ""We should never have spent our money on that player,"" or whatever, but that misses the point. There's always going to be personnel moves that are good and bad.

null,false,redindh,null,null,null,"There was no such thing. It was a brand not a group. It was supposed to be a group full of officers and soldiers who defected and wanted to topple the government. Reality was different from the crap we've been hearing.

One guy and his friends defected and called themselves that. They got popular on the propaganda channels who's owners and government wanted the Syrian government toppled. Next thing you know, backwater areas of Syria had Free Syrian Army popping up. The reality was that the vast majority of Syrian soldiers defected they didn't join the ""free syrian army"". They either just went home or went to refugee camps. Some rejoined the army later on.


The Free Syrian Army is what civilians who armed themselves used. Every thug, smuggler, jihadist, sectarian idiot and people who were desperate for money joined local groups. They called themselves that name to get access to the supplies that countries like the UK and the US were giving. They could ""liberate"" villages and towns and systematically loot them. John McCain went and visited a Free Syrian Army group called Northern Storm. They were smugglers turned rebels and spent 80% of their time kidnapping people. One of the beheaded American journalists was sold to ISIS by the very same group McCain visited.


That is the problem. The ""fsa"" groups are too criminal. Every single major victory was won by jihadists who are intelligent enough to keep their presence low key. The ""free syrian army"" spend too much time stealing and looting. They take credit for what jihadists do to get more supplies from the west. That is why despite outnumbering jihadist groups, they always get crushed when they piss one of them off.  Too many of their men get disillusioned and join jihadist groups like Al-Qaeda or ISIS. They sell whatever weapon they get from foreigners to both groups. ISIS used weapons the Americans shipped to Syria to kill Iraqi soldiers.

I'm really pissed off at the situation. Al-Qaeda and ISIS were dying organisations in 2010. Cameron for short term gain took part in their rise by being part of the stupid attempt by France, USA and the sectarian backward rulers of Turkey and Saudi Arabia. He and other leaders turned a blind eye to Turkey becoming jihadist central. They all thought those idiots would just die and never threaten the west.

&gt;**I’m having another baby. But I can’t tell you what it will look like**

&gt;As you may have heard, the BBC has taken my gun and my badge, and I must admit it’s all been a bit of a shock. For more than 12 years Top Gear has been my life, completely. It was an all-consuming entity, a many-tentacled global monster that was dysfunctional and awkward and mad but I loved it with a passion. I loved it like my own child. Which in many ways it was. But then, one day, I read in Her Majesty’s Daily Telegraph that my contract wasn’t going to be renewed and that they were going to give my baby to someone else.

&gt;I felt sick because after I’d lost my home and my mother, I’d thrown myself even more vigorously into my job and now, idiotically, I’d managed to lose that too. The sense of loss was enormous. I used to think about Top Gear all the time. It was a black hole at the centre of my heart. I woke every morning worrying about every single line. And I went to bed at night worrying that the changes I’d made during the day were wrong. Friends would talk to me when we were out and, though I could see their lips moving, I couldn’t hear what they were saying. My mind was always elsewhere. I was comfortably numb.

&gt;Two days before the “fracas”, I’d been told, sternly, by my doctor that the lump on my tongue was probably cancer and that I must get it checked out immediately. But I couldn’t do that. We were in the middle of a Top Gear series. And Top Gear always came first. The hole it’s left behind seems to stretch for eternity. And eternity is a big place. Imagine a ball of steel the size of the Earth. Now imagine a fly landing on that ball once a day, and then taking off again. When it eventually has worn the ball of steel away to nothing, that is just the start of eternity. And I’ve somehow got to fill it.

&gt;Playing patience on my laptop is not the answer. Because when you get bored, and you will, it’s still only eight in the morning and you can’t even think about going to the pub for four more hours. And then you have to decide not to go to the pub because that’s the road to ruin and despair.

&gt;So you watch the lunchtime news and it’s full of Ed Miliband doing his new Dirty Harry act and David Cameron in a hospital with his tie tucked into his shirt and his sleeves rolled up, and it’s still five hours until the start of Pointless. So you go to the shops, and for the first time you are aware that every penny you spend is coming from a pot that’s no longer being topped up. So you decide not to spend anything at all.

&gt;The only good thing is that my son is currently living with me in London, doing A-level retakes. Which means I can spend, ooh, about 16 hours a day reading about the Cold War and helping him with his creative writing coursework. But soon he will be gone, and then the yawning chasm will open up once more.

&gt;We read often about people who live on benefits, and it fills us with rage that they are sitting about with a plasma television we bought, eating chocolate biscuits that aren’t bloody well theirs. Yet after a couple of weeks in the same boat (well, all right, mine’s more of a liner), I’m beginning to develop a bit of sympathy. Because what the hell do they do all day to stay sane? I suppose it helps when all your friends are on the dole as well. You can all hang out in the bus shelter together. But selfishly, most of my friends have jobs, which means that until eight at night I have almost no one to play with.

&gt;This means I have to make everything last for hours. I have set aside this afternoon to fill in the membership form for a local tennis club. And then I shall use all tomorrow morning to take it round. The afternoon? Not sure yet. I may organise my jumpers. And so we get to the nub of the issue. When you are thrust into the world of early retirement, it’s no good living from day to day because then you’re just a twig in a stream. You just get stuck in an eddy till you rot. You need to have a long-term strategy. You need something that will fill the void.

&gt;But what? Squash? Really? I’m 55 years old, which means that long before I become good my knees will explode and my ears will fill up with hair. Fishing? Hmm. I’m not certain, when you’ve spent a life being chased across the border by angry mobs and shot at in helicopter gunships, that you can fill the hole by sitting on the bank of a canal, in the drizzle. It’s the same story with gardening. When your Maserati’s done 185mph you’re not going to get much of a thrill from a rhubarb growth spurt.

&gt;One of my friends, who shall remain nameless, save to say that his name begins with R and ends in ichard Hammond, decided to fill his enforced leave by training his dog. And now, after just a couple of weeks, he reports that the dog in question hates him and hides whenever he comes into the room.

&gt;Things will only get worse because recent studies have found that people who retire early stand an increased chance of developing dementia. They also live in a constant state of anxiety and will die nearly two years sooner than they might had they stayed at work. At 55, then, you’re in a limbo land where time is simultaneously with you and against you. You are too young to put your feet up but too old to start anything new.

&gt;Which is why I have made a decision. I have lost my baby but I shall create another. I don’t know who the other parent will be or what the baby will be like, but I cannot sit around any more organising my photograph albums.

&gt;Especially as most of the pictures I have are from a fabulous chapter that’s now been closed. The child is grown. The dream is gone.

I think that's highly unlikely but *you* might go back to that while others continue to enjoy a high tech lifestyle (oh, didn't you say you're a lawyer? You could be among the privileged few, I guess). 

Meanwhile, the hole in the ozone is not cured and there is a whole raft of other problems that make that just one catastrophy among many and there is absolutely nothing being done (5% of British electricity comes from windmills now, if I remember right). 

&gt;I don't know if you've noticed but this planet is dying anyway. 

This is a crap thing to say, go to hell. You are dying anyway and I'm pretty sure you would take some pills if, god forbid, you got a fatal illness that could cut short your life. I'm pretty sure if someone you care about got killed in an accident you wouldn't think - oh well they were going to die anyway. Shithead! 

&gt;Or we figure out how we're fucking up, solve those issues and then go further...

*We* are clearly not doing anything like you suggest. There are reports about the ecosystem that are telling humanity what to do - roll back industrial civilisation, it is very clear. Meanwhile, there is no technology that can get us anywhere like far enough to look for new places to live, it's entirely delusional to think we can. They haven't even worked out how to make a decent battery so you can have a practical electric car yet. The low hanging fruit has been consumed, it was all down to oil and the oil is running out fast and if we burn what's left we are going to make it harder for future generations to cope with. 

I find it amusing how propaganda about debt hits people so hard that I keep hearing how high levels of borrowing are going to affect people in the future when money is just an artificial system that could be reset any time you want to but when the subject of pollution comes up it's - don't worry, we are so clever we can solve the problem, burn baby burn and drill baby drill!

null,false,leftthinking,null,null,null,"House Prices and the the rental market.

how to fix them:

Mortgages om residential property to only be allowed for owner-occupiers. no more buy-to let.

Social rental housing needs a huge boost. 

First remove all the housing from councils (political meddling is too easy) and place it in the hands of not-for-profit Housing Associations, and from them into a national network.

End Right-to-Buy and Help-to-Buy. Offering discounts like is simply pushing more money into house prices and does nothing to build more housing.

Replace them with a Right-to-Purchase, where a tenant can buy the home they live in from the Housing Association bit by bit in shared equity. If the tenant buys 5% of the home they get 5% off the rent, and pay 5% of the repair bills. The housing association gets the capital investment in the home freed up early to re-invest in more housing.

Cap the equity the tenant can own at 45%, to buy out right they can go and get a mortgage and it means the HA retains control of the repair budget.

Allow the equity a tenant has to be movable within the national system so if a couple move from a one bed flat to a two bed house when they get their first child the can shift the investment over to their new home.

This should all put a large amount of freed up capital in the hands of the Housing Associations to build more homes.

One of the big problems with housing is the builders. I don't mean the people who put one brick on top of another, but the huge companies that they work for. These companies like huge estates of thousands of new homes to be approved that they can build over the next decade. It gives them the chance to plan their strategy and means they can *limit supply and keep prices high* thus maximising their profits.

I want these leviathans place in the system to be taken by the Housing Associations whose plan is not to make a quick profit though sale but a long term profit through renting. It would mean many more smaller developments would get taken forward, a better quality of housing as the HA are looking for long term investment, and more housing being built as there is no incentive on HAs to limit supply.

There also needs to be an expansion of the housing association idea into the multiple occupation/house share market. A social landlord that will rent to a group of people who share a house.

I completely disagree, I don't see any any sign of this upcoming collapse and consider it rather a good thing that ordinary people didn't lose their life savings. What other realistic option to putting your money into a bank is there?

&gt;Other banks would have replaced them and house prices would have fallen dramatically.

They may have done, maybe, but they sure as shit aren't going to be giving mortgages to first time home buyers after last time.

&gt;

&gt;__Elisabeth Clara Heath-Sladen__  (1 February 1946  – 19 April 2011 ) was an [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_people) actress best known for her role as [Sarah Jane Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Jane_Smith) in the British television series *[Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)*. She was a regular cast member from 1973 to 1976, alongside both [Jon Pertwee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Pertwee) and [Tom Baker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Baker), and reprised the role many times in subsequent decades, both on *Doctor Who* and its spin-offs, *[K-9 and Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-9_and_Company)* and *[The Sarah Jane Adventures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sarah_Jane_Adventures)*. 

&gt;Sladen was interested in ballet and theatre from childhood, and began to appear on stage in the mid-1960s, although more often as a [stage manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stage_manager) at this time. She moved to London in 1970 and an appearance in the police drama *[Z-Cars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-Cars)* led to her being selected for a part in *Doctor Who*. She stayed as a regular cast member alongside Pertwee and Baker until 1976. She subsequently starred in other roles on both television and radio, before semi-retiring to bring up a family in the mid-1980s.

&gt;She returned to the public eye in the 2000s with more *Doctor Who* related appearances, which culminated in taking a regular lead role in *The Sarah Jane Adventures*. The show earned the [Royal Television Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Television_Society) 2010 award for Best Children's Drama. She also made regular guest appearances on the main television series, and provided voice-over commentaries for its releases to DVD.

&gt;Sladen died of cancer on 19 April 2011. Her death made national and international news headlines, and major television stations and newspapers paid her tribute.

Maybe it was just that game against Sunderland that made him seem so good, or maybe, as much as he wanted to play with Pelle, what Tadic needs is a striker to run between and behind the lines so he can find space and create proper space for others. Pelle and Tadic both try to find the ball for onrushing wingers, but if both are on the pitch that usually means only one onrushing winger really, and that can end up being easily marked.  I had hoped Djuricic might be an answer for that trouble, and maybe he could have been if he'd got the time to adapt and fit in with the team, but he hasn't quite managed that either. The problem is we have so many attacking midfield players that can play in varying front 3 positions that I don't see us getting a Tadic replacement.

&gt; Why are you assuming that someone who doesn't want to do what the doctor suggests isn't seeking some other remedy to their problem. [...] you have to be extremely lucky to get good treatment from a GP, let alone get referred appropriately.

For a diagnosed condition (which they will need to claim inability to work) NICE provide evidence based treatment plans. There comes a point where frankly people need to be told that the medical professionals knows better than them. 

If one doesn't wish to follow the treatment plan for a condition that keeps them from work that's their right however to then claim money to subsidise their ignoring of the evidence and expert opinion is wrong.

If Mrs X wants to engage in aromatherapy to treat her depression that's fine but don't expect the taxpayers to subsidise the years she will spend on the dole inexplicably not cured and ignoring the experts.


&gt; In your mind, maybe there are people stuffing their faces on KFC as an excuse not to go to work but I don't think that's very likely. 

I didn't insinuate that anyone is purposely making themselves unwell to avoid work. I do however think that many people get themselves into a cycle where they don't actually want to take meaningful steps to improve their lives or even accept they may have a problem.  These people need a kick up the arse.


&gt; And if a few people are doing that, why should you care? Surely their fucked up situation is punishment enough so that your impeccably moral life will not be impinged by the unmeasurable sum of money coming out of your paycheck to sustain them?

You can keep belittling the taxpayers but that doesn't mean they shouldn't have a right to care where their money is going.

I really don't know how you twisted their words into this.

A black community, fed up of years of 'random' stop-and-searches targeting them, who already had tensions building between them and the police, became incensed over a police shooting of one of their own, which led to protests and riots. It doesn't make any of the criminal acts during those riots any less criminal, it just goes some way to explaining why the backlash against *that particular shooting* was so strong.

I really don't know how you got from this to ""certain races are entitled to commit crime"". Some fantastic mental gymnastics going on there mate.

2. I don't have a cavalier attitude, I have to put a certain sum of money on the side every week to pay the powerful agents who will make me suffer if I don't. I therefore recognise that that portion of ""my"" income was never mine in the first place. The amount of money available to me is determined by way of a social construct. The value of the money and what happens to it is absolutely nothing to do with me, I don't pretend I have any influence on how it's spent. I do not feel it's anything to do with me. Only the money that remains in my pocket after paying the expenses I have to pay for rent and utilities is mine in any real sense. The rest is only passing through, I am without agency. The fact that money is deducted from your wages as ""tax"" is a psychological trick. You are headfucked and don't know it. 

3. I can't, your basic perception of reality is too different. All I can say is you are a naive person who is far too trusting of authority. This is not something we can engage about and have any sort of useful conversation and for that reason I can't be bothered. 

As I token I will offer this: It is my perception that there are areas about which the medical profession is completely clueless. If you  read the literature on ADHD (I am entirely a layperson on this matter) you will see that doctors are dispensing speed to children willy nilly without any of the close support that you'd need to see if that's the best solution.

With regards to privatising the NHS, I understand UKIP had an internal debate regarding the NHS, and Farage's ideas were shot down. I know he's since changed his mind.

With regards to scrapping colour discrimination, I think it's too early t do that, but scrapping laws on nationality, at least for employment, is fine. Gordon Brown was right on that one.

There's plenty of offenses committed by councillors that don't make the national news. In the week of the EU elections, around 20 councillors were charged with criminal or civil offenses. I guarantee if one of them were UKIP you'd have heard about it.

If the Scots get less money then they have a real and legitimate call for another referendum. I'd like to see Farage suggest that the Scots don't get a referendum on *that*.

""Tories undermine patient consent
The Conservative party’s election manifesto contained an extraordinarily retrograde assault on the rights of people with mental and physical health problems in receipt of benefits.

On page 28 of the manifesto, under the euphemistic heading; “We will help you back into work if you have a long-term yet treatable condition”, they propose that; “People who might benefit from treatment should get the medical help they need so they can return to work. If they refuse a recommended treatment, we will review whether their benefits should be reduced.”

In other words, people with mental health problems, drug and alcohol problems, or who are overweight will no longer be able freely to choose to consent, or withhold their consent, to treatment – to decline a recommended treatment will result in benefits sanctions, and consequent misery and poverty. This is particularly ironic, given that poverty and social inequality are significant contributory factors to many long term health and mental health difficulties in the first place.

This suggestion undermines a fundamental principle of medical and psychological healthcare, namely that of informed consent: a person who is capable of giving their consent has the right to refuse to receive care or services. It is wholly inappropriate to threaten the withdrawal of benefits in order to influence that decision. This is particularly true in mental health care, where therapy based on coercion simply will not work.

We are pleased that all political parties have made commitments to increase investment in mental health care. We profoundly regret the fact that the Conservative Party appear to believe that it is appropriate to constrain the freedom of choice and basic human rights of the most vulnerable people in society. If this is not their intention, we call on them to clarify their stance.

I am particularly useless with dates, times and numbers. Words on forms, letters, documents etc. make sense individually but collectively carry little meaning. My understanding from a situation is often not the same as other people given the same information. I often accept the interpretation given to me by a trusted person. I am signed up to an Advocacy charity in case things get more difficult.

To people I meet I probably appear OK, if a little eccentric and I am recovering from the worst of my issues. I am, ""Fakin' it 'til I'm makin' it"". Which is working towards a ""cure"" but also feels like a person who is illiterate saying they, ""Cannot find their glasses"". I used to have a good job in education with a pension. Now I don't.

But forms and officialdom take me right back to the worst of panic attacks. An ATOS interview is a life-threatening event.
So far I have not even tackled the form for reduced costs for happy-tablets. I just pay the cost and hate myself every month.

Currently I am volunteering at my local foodbank which is great progress but now I have to fill in a form from the DWP about, ""Permitted Work"". It took me four months to ask for the form and I have had it for three weeks.

This story is freaking the shit out of me. Tomorrow I have to deal with this form before the DWP notice it hasn't been returned and stop my benefits. I could be the first person to lose benefits for volunteering with the foodbank as therapy towards a planned return to work.

Given all that information about my life can anybody explain how I would cope with Mark Jacka's situation? How would anybody? Can't somebody at the DWP see that some people are going to need more support and actually offer that support? Can't they make a tick box for that? Can't someone at the job centre go over and ask, ""Do you need any help?"" It really is that simple, people don't need to die for lack of support!!!


A lot of what is written above is not immediately obvious to the onlooker but I don't imagine my situation is too different from many others.

To me the BBC was wrong to sack him and not try to help him instead and the fact that they compared him to a pedophile while he was dealing with everything else is in my opinion really a very scummy move.

Just some things it's know Clarkson was dealing with not to pardon him but just to make you think of how you might start to fray also under the same situation.

3. You can set up a Limited company in about 5 minutes.  You can assign 50% of the shares to your parter (or any percentage really).
4. If you think that there's even a *chance* you'll hit the VAT threshold - register.  It will save you a lot of pain and expense in the long run.  Take a look at the [Flat Rate Scheme](https://www.gov.uk/vat-flat-rate-scheme/overview)

What proportion of those working in the South require access to London offices to do their job?

That makes explaining the cause of and changes since the financial crisis to the general public very difficult. They don't want to hear about colaterized debt obligations or credit default swaps, they want to be able to point at someone they can blame. The high salaries and subsequent (fairly unrelated to the GFC) scandals have made 'bankers' an easy target (admittidly deserving so).

This problem is compounded by the fact that politicians are quite happy to sit back and let banks take all the blame since it hides their role in the whole thing and the general public do the same to avoid the truth that irresponsible mortgage lending goes hand in hand with irresponsible mortgage borrowing.

The short answer is that new Basel limits are incredibly tough, one of the reasons so many banks have stopped lending in the last few years (the 'credit crunch') is to build up enough reserves to meet them. That combined with the plan to ring fence high street from commercial banks should mean that will banks may still make loses we should never need to bail them out again to protect the savings of the general public.

That deals with the known factors and to some extend the 'known unknowns' however the problem is the 'unknown unknowns'. These of the things that you don't even realise might be a problem until they pop up and destroy you.

null,false,[deleted],null,null,null,"&gt; Essentially: how does self-assessment work for someone like me? I will need to declare earnings so they can tax me, but would my self-assessment include information about pay from my current employer?

OK self assessment. When you do your self assessment each year there is a section for self employed and PAYE employment. You fill in both, putting how much you earned self employed and how much you earned on PAYE and what tax you paid through PAYE which you get from your P60.

The total profit/loss from self employment and the gross income is added together and the tax due is calculated. The tax you paid through PAYE is deducted from this figure. If you made a profit self employed you pay the difference and if you made a loss you get a refund on some of the PAYE income. For example if you earned £12,000 PAYE and paid £400 tax but made a £2000 loss self employed, the sum total of taxable income is £12,000 - £2,000 = £10,000. Because you paid more tax through PAYE than your tax bill should be, you'd get a refund of £400. 

NI contributions - being on PAYE you won't have to pay Class 2 but you will have to pay Class 4 depending on profit.

Just to add, your income for income related benefits such as Working Tax Credit is the total taxable pay for both combined so as in the example above where we made a loss, your declared income for WTC is £10,000.

&gt; Something more business than finance: is it that much more difficult to setup as a partnership than as a sole trader?

Not really. A partnership with two people requires three sets of self assessment to be done, one for each partner for their share and one for the partnership. However where it gets complicated is the legal side, making up the agreement between you both.

&gt; A final question that really has me stuck: should I register for VAT straightaway

Only do this if the majority of your customers are VAT registered, i.e business otherwise you become uncompetitive very quickly. For example two people buy a widget for £10 from China and sell it on Ebay for £12. Fees aside, the person who is not VAT rated walks away with £2. The person who is VAT rated will either have to walk away with £1.67 or increase the price by 40p to get £2. A buyer who is VAT registered won't care about the extra VAT because they reclaim it so the net cost to them is nothing. A non-VAT registered buyer will just see it as an extra £0.40 on the price as they can't reclaim it.

Davies got bought expecting to start for us, and he got benched in favour of Rose way before Rose got to his recent purple patch.

The Dalek Emperor's ship also fell through time, escaping destruction at the end of the Time War. He created a new race of Daleks, human Daleks. These are not of the same breed of Dalek as those created by Davros before the war, these ones worshiped the Emperor. Rose destroyed them with the power of the Time Vortex, reducing the army to dust.
The Cult of Skaro also survived, taking the Genesis Ark into the void to escape the Time War and ensure the Daleks' survival. The army of Daleks released from the Ark above London was sucked into the Void, the Cult initiating an Emergency Temporal Shift to escape.
The Cult again appeared in Manhattan in the 30s, again trying to use humans to create Daleks. They also mutated their leader to create a hybrid. Three were destroyed and killed, Caan activating another Emergency Temporal Shift to escape.
Caan arrived in the Time War, loosing his mind as he passed through the Time Lock. He guided Davros' ship from the War, saving him from the Nightmare Child. Davros used his own cells to manufacture a new Dalek army. The army was all but destroyed by Donna.
A Dalek ship escaped, falling through time to arrive in 1930s Britain were three posed as Ironsides fighting for the Allies in the Second World War. They activated the Progenitor, establishing a New Paradigm of 5 Daleks. The New Paradigm exterminated the Davros Daleks, them being impure, and forced the Doctor to allow them to escape through a time corridor. From there they built the new Dalek Empire.

b) Since I was considering not voting, a friend pointed out to me that voters for extreme parties (like UKIP) will all be voting, and if I could help to sway the balance then that would be a good thing.

I hate to be all right-wing, but it *did* cost you.

* The population of the UK is ~[65 million](http://www.google.co.uk/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=sp_pop_totl&amp;idim=country:GBR:DEU:CAN&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en)

If you were in the USA, a [""Silver"" plan would cost ~$4,000](http://www.webmd.com/health-insurance/insurance-costs/insurance-cost-calculator) / £2,700.  You'd also have a deductible meaning you'd have to pay the first $5,000 of any treatment.  Plus a cost for visiting your GP.

null,false,FezojT,null,null,null,"&gt;They whine on about tuition fees despite the fact that they are getting a grant to cover them so what difference does it make how much it costs.

Granted whilst you're at uni it's not a concern. Now that myself and a lot of my friends are on the final leg, people are beginning to realise that £700 - £1000 per year repayments for the next 30 years or more isn't great, and that's on the old fees. The kids coming through behind us will probably mostly never pay back their student debt in full throughout their working lives. It really does make a difference, and my life would be easier if tuition fees weren't so high. Compare our system to Germany's, where a university education typically costs about 500 EUR per year, or to the Scandinavian system, where higher education is free. 

On top of all this we're being told that in order to have a functioning economy, we're more likely to die before we'll be able to retire, the ladder onto the housing market is being pulled up by the preceding generation and the government policy of sending everybody to university means that in some areas there is a sizeable graduate job market saturation; I know too many people who got good degrees (first class marks from the top end of the Russell Group) in the wrong subjects (English literature, History) and are trying to scrape together the beginning of the rest of their lives on a salary of £20k with a job based in central London. The younger generation is being mildly fucked in order to cater to an older demographic who is more likely to elect people into government. It's absolutely right that students should engage in politics, both individually and through organisations such as the NUS (as absurd as they can be at times) because nobody else is going to make decisions in their interest.

It's maybe not universally the standard but it is very, very common.  I worked in a bunch of bars and did a trial shift (as far as I can remember) every time.
  
As most people have said, it's a legally grey area, and to be honest with you I really don't think it's worth pursuing, in reality.  How long did you spend shadowing versus performing actual tasks?  Say you spend 2 of the 3 hours doing work of a regular employee, so that's about 14 quid in London?  

We always very deliberately and specifically made it clear that ""this is a trial shift, in the event that you are not offered a position it is unpaid as part of the interview process"".  

Where they've fucked you a bit is making you do it on a Saturday night.  We would always have trial shifts mon-thurs, pair you with an experienced staff member, etc.  

The part that I don't agree with is that it's a deliberate ploy to get free labour from a series of interviewees, 3 hours at a time.  Bar restaurant work is pretty straightforward, we hired most of the people who got to the trial shift stage, we didn't offer some a position because they clearly were unsuited for it.   You said that you decided at the time you weren't right for it - I can almost 100% guarantee if you didn't fuck anything up massively and seemed keen on the job they would have offered it to you.  It's definitely not worth the effort to process CVs, book in interviews, have someone spend the first hour being shown the ropes and then scam them for 2 free hours of potwashing.  

In conclusion:  All work should be paid, but in practice unpaid trial shifts are very, very common.  They shouldn't have made you do it on a busy night.  They weren't deliberately scamming you.  You're not wrong from a legal standpoint and sometimes you have to take a stand against these things, but how much more of your time is this actually worth to you?

If it ends up being permanent, I think the party's entirely in the wrong in this matter. Caving in when confronted by hysterical Breitbart witch hunts isn't what the party ought to be doing- particularly given this thing's context. 

""kill all men"" is a stock phrase- practically a meme. It's a joke employed with the express intent of winding up the sort of MRA that takes the slightest pinprick as a prelude to a cultural marxist death squad breaking down their door. It's the same sort of edgy humour that prompts things like the #DeathToTheWest hashtag- it's a *joke*, and, to anyone with the slightest bit of awareness of the context, not a problem at all. 

As an indicator as to the sort of imbecile propelling along this bandwagon, [do examine these tweets](https://twitter.com/sarahlicity/status/589131715869859840).

null,false,r155,cnty-uk,Swansea/Bristol,null,"**Government:**
I think the problem's with the out dated Westminster system of government. Equal devolution for all Countries in the union. Proportional Representation. Directly elected Executive (i.e. the PM wouldn't just be taken from the biggest party). Republicanism and a focus on meritocracy and transparency, not on money and elitism. A written constitution, enshrining protection of a fully reformed fair-government system and the NHS. A fully secular state. Better local government systems, where MPs are elected to run constituencies (like a mayoral role in the US).

**Education:**
The consecutive governments lack of willing to create mandatory lessons in schools, educating teenagers about Politics and Law - two fundamental parts of our society that are completely overlooked in secondary education. Rigid lessons and subjects that don't cater to an individual students needs (see CGP Grey's criticisms of the educations system).

**Law and Order:**
Scrapping PCSOs, utterly pointless, I would much rather have one police officer than two PCSOs. Community initiatives, educating primary school children and showing them that the Police are there to help. Proportional justice - i.e. yes you should be punished for hurting another person, but there should be a massive focus on reformation and education while you serve your time. Decriminalisation of the most harmful drugs and better support for those who seek it. Legalisation of cannabis. Help for small businesses and the people when going to court - if they're a fundamental part of government they should be free and accessible for everyone (I'm talking about court fees, not solicitors).

**Health:**
Enshrined protection of the NHS from Private enterprises. A guarantee that if the NHS can't provide treatment for a life threatening illness, it will pay for the all expenses, for it to be completed privately; even if it has to be done abroad.

**Defense and Security:**
All treatment for veterans to be paid for - mental or physical health; governments expect to send young men and women to fight wars and then drop them as soon as the jobs done with no support. An emphasis on peace and neutrality - although we will not hesitate to defend democracy or the vulnerable. **Edit:** Some bloody laws on privacy and spying.

**Economy:**
Less reliance austerity. Primary funding and tax breaks for the Engineering and sciences - to encourage growth in these areas. Less focus on London. Expansion of housing projects, by giving tax breaks and incentives to competing building firms. The internet should have legal protection - i.e. all citizens should have the right to assess some level of private internet. 

**Culture and Society:**
A secular state. Promotion of the British Identity - i.e. creating a state we can all be a part and  proud of; focusing on Unity - people saying British rather than English. Funding for grass roots arts and sport.

Sure, there are those who are opposed to the NHS on ideological grounds, or believe that health care is not something that should be provided to those who cannot pay - or indeed that it should be turned completely into a profit making venture.

But for the most part people like the system the way it is. Is it perfect? Of course not. Could it be better? Absolutely.

Do you know what the main differences would be between setting up a partnership, or setting up a limited company and having equal 50% shares? I know that if you setup a limited company then essentially the company is it's own entity and I work for it, but hold shares. I'm not sure how much more difficult it would be to establish a limited company, and I'm also not sure of the proper method to take a 'salary' from a limited company. Salary is obviously variable and depends upon sales, does it need to go through some sort of PAYE system? Also, if I went limited and there were two of us, does that now classify us as 'employees' and mean that we need things like liability/business insurance ?

Public transport cannot support that many people  and with so many out of work, the economy and this your efforts to be environmentally beneficial, cannot be sustained.

There is an issue, and we need to change something. However, equally there are some who just keep saying 'we need to change' and offer no credible methods of changing without having a monumental impact of infrastructure, the food chain or other aspects of society. We would in effect, trade one global disaster for another. We cannot have radical change because if it goes wrong, we cannot fix it quick enough. We need to  slower but safer , fixing the issue and reducing emissions to an acceptable level while maintaining society's functionality. 

&gt; we eat oil

I'm unsure what you mean  by this., if it's liberal (cooking oil) or metaphorical for our fuel consumption.  Oil is currently at very low prices in comparison to recent years but I'll stick with your organic farming  point. It's not that the food corporations want you ignorant, just that it's not financially feasible and costs a lot more. Plants are eaten by birds, insects and other animals. If we are to produce enough food (without meat) for ourselves, we would have to use pesticides to protect them. It's not a garden patch we're talking about, where you can get away with just keeping an eye in them.  To produce enough food and quick enough to support the world's population, we would have to use fertilsers (and the production of Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium which are crucial to fertilisers, will have an environmental impact too). Then, to ensure that the crops reach every corner of the country/globe without rotting, we would have to preserve them somehow (and fly them there). 

It is far too easy to overlook the necessary costs of crop-dusters, tractors to collect the crops, planes to transport them, which would increase exponentially as the need for crops grows.

There is no way of negating these environmental costs without breaking apart society and living in small colonis where transport isn't needed, and that won't happen.",null,0,null,1429449215,null,0,false,0,cqheytx,null,t3_32wzun,null,t1_cqheytx,null,t1_cqgrun6,null,null,null,1432478217,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

I really cannot see this being a choice; rental properties in my city are overpriced and undermaintained because landlords can get away with it. I would rather buy a less nice house and put my own time and effort into improving it and at least feel a sense of satisfaction in that but there simply are not small, affordable properties available right now.


As for flexibility and comfort in not needing to worry about the property - that's counterbalanced by the fact that you have to worry about your landlord ignoring you when the heating breaks or the shower stops working or there's damp coming in from the roof - it means that when your yearly contract is up you have to worry yourself over whether they're going to put the rent up or decide to sell... and if they do decide to sell (which 2 of my landlords have done) then you have to worry about trying to get your security deposit back and trying to find a new place.

But why? As I said previously, there's nothing on your ballot to indicate who you are so unless enough people do the exact same, it will always be explained as a failure of the form rather than a protest.

Whether spoiling or boycotting, both are recorded and both tasted as a failure of the electorate rather than the person contesting. You need as many people as possible to do the same if you want any hope of it being treated as a protest.

As an example based on memory, the PCC votes had incredibly low turnouts, and it was reported in the media as though the public didn't want the policy rather than laziness. Boycott and spoiled ballots both only work if enough people do it to show a clear trend, and boycotts probably got a bigger head start than spoiled ballots.

Given the number of badgers and cattle herds infected will need a suite of tools to tackle the problem. Badger vaccination is one, but practically difficult until an oral vaccine is perfected (not on the horizon). Cattle vaccination and a development of a DIVA test will be a real positive step forward and I believe 'nearly there' provided the legalities of using it can be sorted out. Badger culling is one of tools, but is (arguably: watch the sparks fly) only appropriate for small, well defined areas where there is a very significant level of infection in the badger population... it will never be used on a wholesale countrywide basis. 

It's important to remember that this is a disease that affects many different species (deer, alpacas etc.) and causes a great deal of suffering in the later stages: we need to consider how we maintain a healthy population of wildlife as well as farmed species... the welfare of cattle is maintained by testing and culling before they become sick.

Seriously though, Skrtel has been an absolute rock at the back for us this season. I think in the future our CB partnership will be cemented as Sakho and Lovren, however Skrtel should be staying so far as I'm concerned. I think he's vastly underrated and under-appreciated. For me he's been one of our iconic figures in recent years. I can see why Skrtel may go if we could get a decent price for him, but I don't think our defence is ready for life after him just yet, unless we can bring someone else in.

What I mean by that is Rodgers seemingly hasn't gotten the players that he wants. It's been well documented that he wanted Vorm, Williams, Siggurdson and Dempsey. But he didn't get any of those, and that's the biggest problem. How can Rodgers build HIS team, with his vision without the players that he wants? The way I see it is if we are 5th or 6th, then Rodgers can say 'I didn't want those players. It's not my fault we are where we are now'. 

What we need is for FSG to say to Rodgers 'Here's 40 Mill for the summer transfer. You can buy whoever you want, for however much you want. If you want to spend it on 1 player for 300 grand a week, you can. If you want 5 players on 50 grand a week, go ahead. But Alan here is the finance guy. He'll tell you your limitations, how much money you have and how much you can spend. But I remind you of this: If we get top 4, your job is safe. If we narrowly miss out on top 4, I want an explanation. If we come any lower than 5th, you might lose your job'.

That way, Rodgers either sinks or swims with regards to decisions on who to sign. Because I can guarantee you this, if we got a player who fits Rodgers' system and scores goals (instead of Balotelli), we would be challenging for the top 4 and maybe even the title. It's an absolute travesty that Rodgers, who said that we were't signing Balotelli, was forced to take him on at the last minute because of the transfer committee's ineptness to find a player similar to Suarez (stylistically).

In the end, teenagers can be bloody stupid and stubborn, and rebellious, and the right person with a persuasive tone may well be able to convince them that ISIS is a good thing, and they'd not be terrorists, merely going over to help out innocent victims etc.

If we can stop that happening before these young people get to the airport, well, we've saved far more trouble than dealing with them once they're in ISIS' hands, and also saved them from the reality of what they've signed up for.

Very easy to go 'they've made their choice, fuck 'em, but I imagine most of us were bloody gullible and foolish and wanted to fit in back in our early teens.  A charismatic older person very likely could sway a few minds.  I'm in no way comparing ISIS and the National front, but at the start of the 90s, I remember some of my friends ending up hanging around with older guys, and suddenly starting to talk about 'we should go kick some pakis heads in' and 'why don't they all fuck off back to their own country', when they'd never been like this before.

Statistically most votes simply do not count unless you are in a marginal seat, and even then there are many other forces conspiring to ensure the person you want has no realistic chance of success. (And the idea that all non-voters will unite behind a single candidate is absurd.) So the system is broken. To vote is to say ""I support the broken system, please continue"".

For the record, I think there is a much better solution, one that ensures everybody gets exactly the government they want, but that is another topic and I don't want to derail the thread.

(Also for the record, I always vote, but only in order to fit in with the majority where it is safe to do so.

That's EXACTLY what the literature states - it's exactly what [Figures 1 and 2 in the UCLA lifecycle analysis states](http://www.environment.ucla.edu/media/files/BatteryElectricVehicleLCA2012-rh-ptd.pdf), exactly what [Figure 2 in Notter et al's paper states](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/es903729a), and exactly what [Transport Research Ltd., the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, The Center for Sustainable Systems of the University of Michigan, Schweimer et al, the MIT, and the Argonne National Laboratory state](http://www.pacinst.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2013/02/hummer_vs_prius3.pdf). That's the whole point of a lifecycle analysis in the first place - to provide directional indicators on the overall environmental impact of cars.  If you don't believe the literature can at least estimate lifecycle environmental impact proportions, then you haven't read the literature at all.

Besides, you're contradicting your own claim at the beginning, where you yourself stated with unequivocal certainty at the start that the production of the battery alone is worse than ""buying and running four Hummers in terms of the impact it has on the planet"" (which was an oddly specific number at that).  If we cannot accurately state lifecycle environmental impact distributions, then how do you know what you argued to be the case?  You can't both know, and not know only when it suits your argument.

&gt;the notion that more complex and unique components have greater environmental impact is a sound one.

This was never in dispute in the first place.  The question is whether the environmental impact incurred on account of the battery's lifecycle is sufficient to make electric cars worse for the environment.  As the lifecycle analyses have demonstrated, the answer to that question is a resounding ""no"".

&gt;Some batteries may be taken out and recycled, others won't and may be sold for scrap. This radically affects the carbon debt values and initiatives like the scrappage scheme cannot be predicted ahead of time.

That's already estimated for by the UCLA's paper, for which the base case already assumes a 50% battery replacement over lifetime, as well as recycling thereof.  Once the battery's made, the battery's made, and the paper accounts for both production and recycling, essentially all the carbon emissions that could be incurred on account of the battery.  If the battery were to be scrapped, that would actually lower the carbon emissions incurred on account of the battery.

&gt;Correct me if I am wrong but that is entirely dependent on how the fuel for them is produced and stored with current methodology being primarily fossil.

Not all fossil fuels are made equal.  Your insinuation is that coal, natural gas, and oil are all equal in terms of emissions.  This is patently not the case; according to [the Intergovermental Panel on Climate Change](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_greenhouse-gas_emissions_of_energy_sources), coal emits a median 820 g/kWh, while oil emits 778 g/kWh, and natural gas 443 g/kWh.  As you can see, even natural gas, which is still a fossil fuel, is still much cleaner than coal, the latter of which is only slightly worse than oil.

And you have the braying of the far-right wolves who love the idea of calling all brown people cockroaches, love the army and for some reason don't get the connect between ""Dehumanising a civilian population"" and ""What the Germans did before we beat them in that war that was so cool"".

Somewhere around the middle you have UKIP going ""Woo! Votes! Fuck the Immigrants!"" and labour falling into the trap of ""Lets take a touch stance!""

All whilst a bunch of people are shouting about how horrible she is, a bunch of people are chatting about how they agree and a terrifying group of people are going ""Well, she comes across a bit strong, but she is just saying what we are all thinking. Maybe not cockroaches, they are still mostly human after all""

And then we, as a country, imprison those that make it here, watch those that try and make it here die and do nothing to help the situation.

Do you think Nazism appeared out of nowhere? Do you think it was just a surprising force? A bunch of people got together and went ""Why the fuck not discriminate and then slaughter millions of people?""

- Yaya (and Zabaleta) looked like he has had a rest and looked so much better. He even had the energy to run into space - whereas there's been times in other games where the game has opened up and he's just not run into it. 

- Mangala looked brilliant. He's not going to be a Maldini type interceptor, but he makes a load of blocks*, big tackles and was good positionally. 

- I hope Silva is alright, but Nasri has always played his best football when Silva is injured and he becomes the main playmaker. Interesting that every pundit has said its intentional while /r/soccer, and the sky commentators thought it was accidental.

and lastly, on a much more random note, yaya looks like 10 kg/lb (same expression) lighter without that undershirt. Seriously though, he cant play CDM anymore, he looked exhausted at the very end. the dude is 32, he is getting up there in age now.

The bureaucrats who are put in charge of monitoring the performance of the outsourcing company and making sure contractual obligations are being kept to, are often completely out of touch with how things are actually going on the ground. The bureaucrats sit in their office on the opposite side of the building (or 100's of miles away in some cases) and ultimately the only information they are going to get about how the outsourcing is going is from the outsourcing company themselves.. Site inspections? The bureaucrats wouldn't even know what to look for, and would probably give a weeks notice to the private company in any case. 

Moreover, the bureaucrats job security depends on the continued existence of these outsourcing contracts. If they start cancelling contracts or scaring the outsourcing companies off with heavy re-negotiations, the bureaucrat is quite literally redundant because they will then have no outsourcing to oversee.. At a time of austerity they can't rely on being given a new job role if their current role disintegrates.

I don't know what the public expects to happen. Every individual/company in this scenario is acting in a completely rational way, this is merely the end result.

It not the normal way and nor would people expect someone who gone to a university to go into skilled labour.

As I said before pretty sure when the government had this obsession before it led to a decrease in people going into those sort of areas of work. 

As quote from an BBC article from around that time.

&gt; The recent shortage in the supply of plumbers in the UK was **partly due to the expansion of higher education which drew people away from skilled trades**, he says. Apprenticeship schemes became less prevalent and there was a lag before higher education colleges stepped into the role.

I think that's borne out by other studies too, I just don't happen to have a link handy to those atm.

You do have a point, but then, I think a lot of the time it really depends on the metrics you consider to be the most important things. A large part of the reason I'd be okay with healthcare systems in some non-Britain countries is because it's in large part socialised and incurs minimal personal point-of-service cost.

If somebody else is instead more concerned with access to novel and cutting edge therapies then they might be a bit more concerned about the NHS, but the point of the NHS isn't to deliver the newest therapies or drugs or whatever (which are often not even that much more effective if it all), it's to deliver the best possible healthcare to the largest number of people for the lowest possible cost. That's important to me and would cause me to rank it more highly than another system which wouldn't have that.

So I guess sometimes criticism is ideological and based in how we think healthcare should be delivered. That's okay, but we should always remember that despite what our ideological stance might be regarding the NHS, it *does* deliver excellent healthcare for low overall cost.

Nobody wants a US style system. It is misleading to directly equate the private provision of services as being synonymous with moving to a US style system. The drugs are made by private companies- should we attempt to nationalise them? Maybe, but nobody is seriously proposing that at the moment.

It may be best (as UKIP have in fact decided) not to use private provision, but there is an excess of hysteria over this issue that doesn't help the best decisions to be made on the basis of facts.

Sometimes I think these guys make it up on the spot.

UKIP MEPs have some of the worst voting records in Europe, and often vote for/against motions that go against what many would consider to the majority opinion within Britain. For instance, in January 2014 six UKIP MEPs, including party leader Nigel Farage, voted against an EU motion to clamp down on the illegal ivory trade. The 2014 UKIP European election video contains a section attacking the EU for the damage that has been done to the UK fishing industry. This again is a matter of opinion, but the claims in this video would have more credit if Mr Nigel Farage, a member of the European Fisheries committee for three years, had bothered to turn up to more than one single meeting out of 42.

The UKIPper in question quickly rushed to say that UKIP would vote against any measure that would give the EU more sovereignty over Britain, regardless of the way it was proposed. 

I then asked him to respond to the motions proposed in the 2010 manifesto (which has strangely been deleted from their webpage and no longer widely available) which, amongst others, advocated it to make it legal to discriminate against gender in the workplace, abolished maternity leave and removed the European employment right to paid holidays and breaks in the working day.

The response I received was simply 'Farage has disowned the document since then'.

All that said, before you commit yourself to it, you should consider the very real possibility that accountancy *(and especially the non-bespoke end of it)* is one of the areas likely to be under threat from automation sooner rather than later.  On top of the normal drivers to this, the government announced in the last budget that the requirement for most people who submit tax returns will be phased out within five years.  I think this is a terrible idea, since I don't trust HMRC to get things right, but it'll have a serious effect on the accountancy industry.",null,0,null,1429457152,null,0,false,0,cqhi204,null,t3_334chu,null,t1_cqhi204,null,t1_cqhg0k5,null,null,null,1432479673,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

&gt;&gt;Hello darkness my old friend I've come to talk with you again because a vision softly creeping left its seeds while I was sleeping, and the vision that was planted in my brain still remains, within the sound of silence. In restless dreams I walked alone, narrow streets of cobble stone. Neath the halo of a street lamp I turned my collar to the cold and damn, when my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light, that split the night. And touched the sound of silence. And in the naked light I saw, ten thousand people maybe more, people talking without speaking,  people hearing without listening, people writing songs that voices never share and no one dared. Disturb the sound of silence. Fools, said I, you do not know, silence like a cancer grows, hear my words that I might teach you, take my arms that I might reach you.  But my words, like silent raindrops fell, and echoed in the wells of silence. And the people bowed and prayed to the neon god they made and the sign flashed out its warning, in the words that it was forming and the sign said the words of the prophets are written on the subway walls, and tenement halls. And whispered in the sounds of silence.

Go back and look at some of the discussion threads from the dark times towards the end of AVB. The consensus seemed to be that a big part of our problem was missing Rose.

It seems clear to me that his problems were two fold. He was coming off of a long term injury and was definitely not back to 100 percent health. And, he was coming back into a team that refused to play a defensive midfielder and was playing Eriksen as a left mid leaving him extremely exposed.

I think it's unfair to immediately jump to motivation as the problem when there are other perfectly good explanations for his poor performance. These are professional athletes, not to say that there aren't any players that struggle with motivation, but I don't think it's the default.

Your firm choice *has* to be the university you want to go to the most because, assuming everything goes well, it's the university you'll end up going to. In the situation you've described where the MPharm is your firm and the MChem is your insurance, if you get the grades for the MPharm, you'll end up going to Belfast. If you miss the grades for the MPharm then if I understand you correctly, you'll get a place for the BSc at Manchester. So the plan you've described is allowed, but it's only a good idea if you'd rather go to Belfast than Manchester. If you'd rather go to Manchester, then it would be silly not to put Manchester as your firm because if it's your insurance, you won't get in if you meet Belfast's requirements.

So we need to take action at the level of society, that means reorganising things so most people work closer to home or we have better public transport and more efficient ways of using cars or vans and so on when they are needed. (EDIT- So I'm not saying you have to give up your car all on your own but when there is a system that can act to mitigate the consequences of the destruction of the ecosystem by industrial civilisation, car ownership will be a thing of the past.)

Again, the reality of eco-meltdown doesn't care about your job. 

If you study the process of industrial agriculture, more or less oil is turned into fertilisers and powers machinery to grow the massive quantities of stuff so when the price of oil goes up you get the Egyptian failed revolution or whatever you like. 

We eat oil. The food we grow is a product of the fossil fuel industry. 

Oil equals your dinner. 

No, I don't mean rapeseed oil. 

&gt;There is no way of negating these environmental costs without breaking apart society and living in small colonis where transport isn't needed, and that won't happen.

It will happen, it's inevitable. The sea is going to rise and take away a chink of the habitable space. The UK's weather, based on the disruptions to the gulf stream, might end up like Canada's weather, what will you be able to grow? 

If the ecosystem breaks down, you won't be able to ignore it.

null,false,somescott,cnty-scotland,Scotland,null,"&gt;Being a trainee doctor is and always has been an absolutely savage few years.



You have no idea what you are talking about. It's actually improved marginally recently but for a long time people just had your attitude that of course it's horrible.


That is not acceptable, not only does it mean the training being provided is inadequate, it means that you could die. If a trainee doctor is overwhelmed that means they aren't coping and will almost certainly make mistakes, any one of which could be deadly.


I'm sure your tone would change if your family member died due to a mistake of what you call a ""shit"" doctor, not even in your comment do you recognise the connection between inadequate training and conditions and mistakes.



&gt;And what they don't tell you is when they get to consultant level they get paid very well for a lot less hours than you'd think.


Consultants work very hard and have an unbelievable amount of responsibility. If any doctor in their ward has a question or is unsure, its the consultant that they go to, the consultant has to have all the answers. Not only that but as you can guess from the name they are at the pinnacle of their training and have to constantly keep up with new developments in healthcare. That makes them incredibly desirable, a consultant, especially in fields like Emergency Medicine like OP is in are gold dust to countries like Australia and definitely Britain too.


But it turns out Australia right now is offering a much better deal, which is why you're seeing lots of people in that field and others emigrating. If conditions here were as kind as you say they are then we would not be seeing so many doctors move their entire lives halfway across the globe.",null,0,null,1429458186,null,0,1429458490,0,cqhijj4,null,t3_334chu,null,t1_cqhijj4,null,t1_cqheuts,null,null,null,1432479902,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

null,false,Muzer0,eng-hampshire,Hampshire,null,"To be fair, the line between Dundee and Invernees via Aberdeen is (as far as I know) significantly quieter than the main route, so the lower price is probably justified. The main issue is that the slower lines around HS1 also double as significant commuter lines for the local stations on that route — those people have no choice but to go on those trains, whereas the people making longer distance journeys could pay more and go on HS1. So loading longer distance, would-be HS1 passengers onto the already-busy commuter routes is just stupid.

Split ticketing is basically an artefact of the franchising system. It's basically just a fact nowadays that some operators are more expensive than others. On top of that, some operators have generally stupid pricing policies.

Here's an example that I'm familiar with. Say you're going on a CrossCountry train from Southampton to Banbury. CrossCountry are quite an expensive operator, and they're the primary method of getting from Southampton to Banbury, so they price those fares. So you end up at £44.50 for an off-peak day return.

But if you can find a split where the primary operators, the ones who ""own"" those fares, are less expensive, then you can make a significant saving. So in this case, let's split at Basingstoke — Southampton to Basingstoke is priced by South West Trains at £13.20, and Basingstoke to Banbury is priced by First Great Western at £15.80, which adds up to £29 — a VERY significant saving. The same principle applies even if there's just one operator, if you can find an anomaly in the fares policy of that operator (for example, I believe another CrossCountry example is that sometimes longer distance fares are more expensive per mile than shorter distance fares, which means that you can sometimes still get savings by splitting (though not as big as this) even if both fares are still priced by CrossCountry)",null,0,null,1429458462,null,0,false,0,cqhioel,null,t3_331e31,null,t1_cqhioel,null,t1_cqhi5ck,null,null,null,1432479965,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

I don't wear foundation much tbh but it's medium coverage, and not really suited to oily skin as it tends to get rather greasy and break me out a little every time I wear it. Looks great on, though, especially when applied with a beauty blender.

The concealer pencil is good for blemishes and I never had a problem with it. The eyeliner is nice and pigmented and smudges easily - a plus for some, but a worry for me with my oily hooded lids.

I don't recommend their eyeshadow though, it has awful pigmentation! Some nice looking colours but they don't build well and I can barely get them to show up even with primer.

There's also this:

""The rules for getting state healthcare in Spain are different from those in the UK.""
""If you are not covered for state-run healthcare through any other means, the Spanish regional health authorities offer a special pay-in scheme (convenio especial). This is a public health insurance scheme available nation-wide where you pay a monthly fee to access state-run healthcare. "" 

 https://www.gov.uk/healthcare-in-spain

So even though we're in a political union, that we contribute billions of pounds of tax payers money to every year, we often still cannot access free health care in our so called 'union partner' countries.

It's especially frustrating since they campaign so hard on Britain's (or England's) fishing rights and blame the EU for the decline in the fishing industry, yet make very little effort to put it right beyond advocating an exit from the EU altogether. Wanting to leave the EU is a perfectly legitimate opinion, but if this issue was so important to them, they would be working *with* the EU for the time being to try and get a resolution.

Their is a saying ""boarders don't exist for doctors"" and it's true. If you're a doctor you can go pretty much anywhere in the world. Conditions are lot better in other places and you'll make a lot more money. 

I know someone who worked in the NHS for years then decided enough was enough and made the jump to France. He is happier, healthier and has a far better quality of life. 

Really do appreciate anybody currently in the NHS because anyone of them could easily move (even with family) country and have a much better life.

Then, twenty minutes in, you move Can out on the right making him ineffective defensively, you leave two central midfielders with no holding/defensive midfielder, leaving massive gaps in between our defense and midfield. 

I know a lot of people will blame Gerrard for a poor performance, but I think it's to be expected. I more so blame the manager who decided to play a unfit, rusty player for 90 minutes.

And I can accept the fact that players get less good as they get older, but that half-assed attitude is totally unforgiveable, espcially given that a) he got sent off in our biggest league match of the season for lacking the composure and restraint expected of someone with his experience and b) the fact that he was trusted to go straight back in the team in our most important game in all competitions this season. Shocking. How Allen, Moreno and Markovic got hooked and not him is beyond me.

Don't get me wrong, that was a collectively terrible performance and the lack of any fight or passion is absolutely sickening. Rodgers got it completely wrong with the 343. I thought it had been made patently clear that other teams had sussed that formation out? Granted, we changed formation (4/5 times?) throughout the course of the game but nothing seemed to work.

To critically evaluate your claim, where's your evidence that it encourages no modal shift? One of the large benefits of HS2 is a step-change in capacity south of Rugby, and the freeing up of train paths on the WCML more generally. That extra capacity is to be redirected, in part, to improving the commuter-rail systems in, and around, our major conurbations. Such improvements *will* encourage modal shift from cars to rail. 

On the subject modal shift, have you considered the modal shift from air to rail as HS2 extends northwards to Scotland. Millions of passengers per year fly between the central belt of Scotland and London/English cities. As the journey times move towards three hours, which phase 2 and then subsequent improvements in Scotland will lead to, precedent would suggest about 80% of them will shift to rail. For the most part, you'd expect only people who were making connecting flights in London to continue using planes. That's a big reduction in GHG emissions (and also frees up a lot of landing slots for the expansion of international services from London airports etc.).

null,false,strolls,null,null,null,"&gt; The first question posed was regarding the freedom of movement within the EU, and what would happen post-exit for both EU nationals arriving and British nationals living in other nations. He mentioned that there would be no change to the principle of free movement, just more deterrants towards ""those who would come here to claim benefits"". …  I asked him, theoretically, what would happen to all the British nationals living abroad in EU countries if Britain abandoned the right to free movement. He didn't really see an issue, as the vast majority of Britons living in Spain (my example country) were self-sufficient with their funding, and didn't require help from Spain's social system. (I'll need to fact-check this one later)

This is classic kipper - making claims that aren't in the manifesto. 

Meanwhile, it's classic UKIP to avoid making manifesto commitments on certain things that are controversial, thus allowing their supporters to advocate anything they personally believe in.

As I recollect, EU's free movement only allows you to move here if you have a ""realistic prospect"" of getting a job, anyway. But Farage is on record as saying that he'll ban admittance of *all* unskilled workers ([1](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/generalelection/nigel-farage-calls-for-fiveyear-ban-on--unskilled-immigrants-as-he-promises-ukip-policy-would-not-stigmatise-wouldbe-migrants-10083830.html), [2](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/04/nigel-farage-new-immigration-watchdog-ban-unskilled-migrants), [3](http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/428943/Nigel-Farage-Ukip-migrants)) not just ""benefit spongers"".

That would lead to a very complicated visa process for Polish plumbers and Spanish statisticians, presumably requiring them to prove they're skilled and that a job awaits them - a visa process that EU nationals do not currently face. 

UKIP can't say what would happen to British people living in the EU - they'd lose their right to stay if we just left. But what would *probably* happen is UKIP would make a reciprocal deal, allowing anyone who are currently resident to stay. Mark Reckless was castigated for implying he might send them all home, but such [a reciprocal deal was what he'd previously discussed with Farage.](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/ukip-mp-mark-reckless-left-feeling-sore-after-nigel-farage-changed-immigration-policy-9877429.html)

I don't think Polish plumbers working over here, or Brits living on the Costa Del Sol, would have to worry about repatriation if UKIP were to take us out of the EU, but that's not really what you should be taking away from this.

UKIP will say anything to get your vote, and they can get away with saying anything because they'll never have to follow up on it. If UKIP ever had to form a government they'd fall apart within weeks from infighting.

The *only* policy that UKIP have consistently campaigned on is leaving the EU. Then, each manifesto, they back it up with a lot of filler that no-one in their base can disagree with - support for the military (three aircraft carriers vs. guaranteed jobs for ex-servicemen), more money for the NHS, lower taxes, free road tax for the drivers of classic cars.",null,1,null,1429459596,null,0,1429466642,0,cqhj9lb,null,t3_334ci2,null,t1_cqhj9lb,null,t3_334ci2,null,null,null,1432480313,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

A list of mistakes:

* Wrong starting line up, Gerrard should not start
* Change of formation lead to Can consistently being out of position
* Change of formation put Gerrard into an even worse role in the team
* Markovic for Balotteli was the wrong substitution; didn't fix the problems with the formation or the personnel on the field
* Coutinho was mostly invisible in the second half, due to the formation change.
* Sterling wasn't much more present in the second half, he doesn't perform well on the wing when he can't cut inside and play quick passes with the forward/attacking mid.
* Allen for Johnson was again wrong. Allen was having a fairly good game keeping possession and passing well. He was moving better than Gerrard. This was the sub that should have removed Gerrard from the team.
* Subbing Lambert on and going for long balls/plan B in the 90th minute? What the hell?!

I'm incredibly disappointed in Rogers today. The players didn't do well enough, but they were hamstrung by poor tactics and terrible decisions from Rogers.

On the inevitable question over whether Rogers should go, I cannot make up my mind.

Yeah, something that costed over 100m pounds. 25m on an injured Lallana, 20m on an un-confident Lovren and a mid-table Markovic. Hell, the one most people were un-excited about, Can, has been the best out of all of them. And he's not even been THAT great, it's just people want to think he is to justify the crazy amounts wasted elsewhere on the squad.

&gt; If United had sacked Ferguson when he had that shit patch he would never have become what he became

The difference is Ferguson had already established himself in Scotland, where all Rodgers has done is won a play-off. No way should Rodgers be our manager for the future. We need someone who can win trophies, get us consistent European football, and throw us the odd title challenge. With the resources Liverpool managers have avaliable it honestly shouldn't be such an ask to overturn Villa in the semis of the FA Cup, or lose less than 9 games in the league (which will probably be over 10 by the season's end). We shouldn't have the second worst GD in the top 7. We're an ambitious club with a great history, we need a manager to match this.

&gt;1 fucking lost FA Cup

How many times are we going to say this before we sink in to mid-table mediocrity?  Like it or not, we need change. The only manager in the last 25 years who has come close to matching what Liverpool need is Rafa, with Houllier not too far behind.

&gt;The change between 1987 and 1991 was one of the very few reliably recorded falls during the entire period covered by this article. Two significant aspects of the educational scene between 1987 and 1991 were that

&gt;the National Curriculum was introduced, and

&gt;the proportion of teachers in primary schools leaving their job during a year increased sharply, from 9 per cent in 1987 to a peak of 14 per cent in 1990, the second largest group of leavers being those taking early retirement.

Having seem the drop in literacy caused by the change to a new curriculum, the  Secretary of State for Education nevertheless decided to introduce a new curriculum in 2013. The rollout was haphazard and poorly planned. I wonder if we'll be seeing a corresponding drop in literacy.

Meanwhile DfE has helped cause a decline in the number of people training to be teachers, which was also associated with a decline in literacy rates.

UK rent prices have little to do with population. It's not as if we have hundreds of thousands of people literally on the street because there aren't homes for them. If that were the case then, yes, it would have a huge impact. 

The biggest single influence on UK house prices has been the promotion of the notion that property is an investment. People get themselves a Buy To Let morgage, purchase a second property as an investment then rent it out. The rental price essentially derives from how much their monthly costs are.

Now I know how we're all feeling. What a fucking shitty state of affairs. Villa played tremendously, as we all expected them to so full kudos to them. We certainly could have played better. Much, much better. Both goals could have been stopped with a bit more solid defending, we could have had an equaliser if we were a bit more clinical and DO NOT get me started on that offside call for Balotelli.
All this said though it's not the end of the world. Granted chances of getting top 4 are slim so when we look back on this season we will have 5th place and two cup semi finals. Definitely not the kind of hopes we want to be achieving but for a very young squad that still hasn't gelled entirely yet not bad.
The future is bright friends. As long as we buy a decent striker in the summer and one or two good players we could be in for a cracker next season. I know many of us will be worried about the strides teams above can make in the market and how much they will be able to improve their team but we do have a fantastic set of players. Given a fully fit squad we genuinely have a top fucking team.
So we'll take this loss and we will be disappointed and we will feel let down but it's not the end. The last few years have been tricky for us and Rodgers is doing a commendable job in creating a winning team for the future and I have every faith he will. All the young players in a team with fantastic potential will take this match as part of their learning curve and use their disappointment to come back next season stronger and hungrier than ever.

null,false,ggow,null,null,null,"Is that really UKIP's immigration policy though? As far as I'm aware, they *do* intend to remove the principle of freedom of movement, with the intention of replacing it with an 'Australian-style points-based immigration system. It's not about removing the incentives for 'benefits tourism' but about making it straight-up harder for EU citizens to move here (in theory it becomes easier for people from outwith the EU to move here, but I'll believe that when I see it. The immigration targets that keep being made and unmade would suggest not). 

How the impacts on UK residents who happen to be EU citizens I do not believe has been made clear. Legally speaking, I believe the protections they enjoy due to EU law are currently enshrined in British legislation i.e. they would not automatically be required to leave. That said, the parties that would see us leave the EU would also so see us leave the ECHR and, therefore, there would be very little to prevent the British government of the day altering the immigrations status of those EU citizens here. Gradually, I would imagine the way EU citizens were treated would become more like how those from out with the EU were treated, in terms of access to benefits, healthcare, education, etc. Depending on the political mood of the country, or the relative influence of different parties, the situation could be better or worse. 


In terms of how British citizens are treated in the EU, for example those in Spain, the situation would likely be quite similar, except that their rights would likely be better protected as a result of Spain staying in the ECHR etc. Their rights to access healthcare, via the multilateral framework that is in place at the moment that ensure equal access, would probably be rescinded (if the UK left the arrangement, which I'd imagine was likely), and there'd probably be other consequences, but it wouldn't be more inconvenient than anything else. For those who wished to go and make their life in the EU afterwards, that would be a different, much harder, matter. 

Really, these things all come down to the politics of the day. UKIP cannot give assurances on how the rest of the EU would react. The fact that those Brits in Spain are self-supporting is besides the point as immigration status doesn't really work on that basis. The legal rights of rEU citizens in the UK would be a bit precarious, legally speaking, but I can't envisage a political environment where it was OK for them to be unfairly treated (after all, we'd still be seeking FTA's with the rEU and scewing their citizens over would not go down well). 

TL;DR That's not UKIP's immigration policy. The system they'd put in place would make it much harder for people to move here. The situation of those left behind post-Brexit would be a political, not legal, matter. Likely, with the interplay of having to maintain good relations with the rEU, it would be ok. Their situation would likely be worse off in terms of entitlements and rights, and the same would be likely of UK citizens in rEU, but it wouldn't be any worse than legal migrants from outwith the EU.

This ridiculous bitterness against Doctors for their salary is a joke, they don't earn that much per hour and it is usually people who are just bitter but believe the Daily Mail when they suggest FY1 earn 200k a year by doing locum work and all drive Porsches.

Tactically, I genuinely think he's clueless and just kind of shoehorns players into formations. And a lot of the time, his subs are baffling. 

But the biggest issue for me is that I don't trust him with anymore money. Since he's been here, he's made 3 good buys: Sturridge, Coutinho, and Emre Can, all for relatively cheap too. Everyone else was either shit, or we paid waaaaaaay too much for them. Although, I do think Balotelli was a decent buy for the money, however, Rodgers hates him. 

Anyways, I feel like we don't have much of a chance at Klopp. I'd be more than happy with Frank de Boer though.

null,false,Rc72,null,null,null,"&gt; It's odd you say it's decent. I recently read some reports that said elderly care is virtually non existent in these countries, Spain especially, and that the British who retire there often have to come home for end of life care. 

A source would be nice. Back in 2000, [the World Health Organisation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization_ranking_of_health_systems_in_2000) ranked Spain's health system 7th worldwide, well above the UK at 18th. France, Italy, Portugal, Greece and Malta, to name but five other EU countries which also receive significant numbers of British ""snowbirds"" also ranked above the UK.

The [Bloomberg ranking](http://www.bloomberg.com/visual-data/best-and-worst//most-efficient-health-care-2014-countries), which apparently concentrates more on cost-efficiency, puts the UK between France and Italy, which rank better, and Spain, Greece and Portugal, which rank worse (but not *much* worse, at least not in Spain's case).

&gt; There's also this:

&gt; ""The rules for getting state healthcare in Spain are different from those in the UK."" ""**If you are not covered for state-run healthcare through any other means**, the Spanish regional health authorities offer a special pay-in scheme (convenio especial). This is a public health insurance scheme available nation-wide where you pay a monthly fee to access state-run healthcare. ""

&gt; https://www.gov.uk/healthcare-in-spain


&gt; So even though we're in a political union, that we contribute billions of pounds of tax payers money to every year, we often still cannot access free health care in our so called 'union partners' countries.

You have seemingly overlooked the ""If you are not covered for state-run healthcare through any other means"" part. As well as the passages above it specifying how you *are* covered ""if you are in receipt of a UK old age state pension or long term sickness benefit"", and can be covered ""if you are a worker seconded to Spain, or the family member of a someone making UK national insurance contributions"". This is all *thanks* to the EU.

So he doesn't get any blame for them being rock bottom in the first place? They are in 9th, we are 5th. I don't understand how you can say he has done better this season. Bare in mind also that it's a weaker league.

&gt;He also lost influential players last season and only had a fraction of the amount of money we had to replace them.

They had a net spend of £53m. We had a net spend of £46m. Hardly a massive difference in the signings. Besides he has alsp wasted a lot of money in the transfer market. Ramos and Immobile have been very poor.

&gt;He also didn't get completely embarrassed in Europe

We were poor but embarrassed? We were a goal away from going through the CL group stages. Henderson had that effort cleared off the line. Again we were poor but embarrassed is very harsh.

null,false,ShittyNameCreator,null,null,null,"No, at least I hope not. Today was very poor form the players AND from Rodgers. But I cant imagine who we would get in who would be better and is a realistic option. For me, Liverpool are a still a huge club however its plain to see we are quite a bit behind the top teams in the league in many departments. Yes, we've spent money this season, but Man City, Chelsea, Arsenal and United have also spent a lot and not had to sell their best players to do it - at least not this season. Furthermore, aside from Arsenal, those teams completely dwarf us in the amount in wages they can offer out to players. This is why I accept Rodgers and FSG's philosophy that we have to buy young players with potential and attempt to grow into a top side and because of that i'm willing to afford Rodgers a lot more time. He has shown today that he still has a lot to improve on, because today was terrible, but I think in his 3 years here he has also shown what kind of manager he can be if we give him time.

To play devils advocate, some would say we have given him plenty of time, but I think if we are to stick with the philosophy of buying young players then even 3 years is an unrealistic amount of time to expect immediate success. But this is all relative to the league, as none of what I just said can be used as an excuse as to why we lost to a relegation candidate team today. Some might think this post is ignoring all the negative things about today but in honesty, I just don't even want to think about it, as everything was just that terrible. However we need to start being able to criticize the manager - hell even tear him a new one at times, without it then snowballing into calling for him to be sacked. 

I'm not saying Rodgers will in the end be a success at Anfield, but I think he's still shown us enough good capabilities as a manager to give him at least another season, with hopefully no more big players leaving (looking atchu, sterling) or injuries to key players.

His hold up play was terrible. Although there were times where he did what he was meant to and laid it off perfectly to Sterling/Coutinho, the vast majority of his hold up play was so bad. His pressing was virtually non-existent until the 80th minute. There were a few times where I couldn't see him on the screen when Villa had the ball in their half.

He didn't get wrongly called offside twice, it was just the once (fair play to him for getting in that position though). But what I'm so pissed at is not Balo getting called offside after making a run (exactly how Suarez did last season, he would get loads of offsides), it was him getting called offside because he was still walking back to the half way line when the play transitioned! That's not an area that requires skill? It's just attentiveness. And he was so incredibly inattentive for perhaps the biggest game Liverpool have played while he's been wearing the red shirt.

It's not surprising we stayed shaky but we found a great run of form. And that's promising.

null,false,OdetoaLiverpool,null,null,null,"Rodgers was one person on a transfer committee, so any blame is shared between members of the committee. That said, I don't think the players themselves were necessarily poor purchases, but instead the type of player we were looking for. Our transfer strategy underpins these signings but it is too soon to evaluate as a definitive failure since we are building for longer term sustained success, rather than trying to beat out sides, that have an obvious advantage over us when it comes to attracting and funding top talent, at their own game. 

It certainly seems that Rodgers has himself championed certain players that haven't worked out, such as Lovren, and he deserves personal criticism for this. But crucially the answer is not to fire him. For the purposes of the argument, let's just accept, for a second, that Rodgers is a very good coach and suggest that his performance in the transfer market is his biggest downfall. Then a good plan, instead of sacking him, might be to give him less responsibility on the transfer committee, or even to implement the original plan of FSG and install a DoF. But yes, instead of this let's go about uprooting our manager, paying him off, replacing him with a replacement that may be much worse but probably at best will only be marginally better given the feasible replacements out there, backing this manager with the funds required to let him implement his own vision and letting him sell players that don't fit said vision (as we saw with Rodgers when he came in), going through *another* transition phase, and then potentially following this with a rinse and repeat. That makes sense. And it might had Rodgers not shown himself capable of managing LFC. But he has. We massively, massively over achieved last season and even this season we have enjoyed sensational form since Christmas. Yes, we were abysmal for the majority of the first half of the season but there were also many factors at play that were out of Rodgers' immediate control, not least losing 80% of our goal output. And before you say ""well we should have signed someone then"", I agree. That's my point. We need to evaluate our transfer strategy and the system that underpins it. And we can do all this without taking a monumental risk in the process. 

Fans, such as yourself, are so naive to the harsh realities. We are a team with the resources, both with respect to finances and player quality/depth, that is about 5-7th in England. You can't expect much more than we have achieved this season by doing the dance in the same way as a Chelsea, for instance. They can afford to shuffle their managers and financially back them up and they can afford to buy proven guaranteed quality. We can't. That's why we have the transfer philosophy that we do, and that's why we shouldn't sack our bloody manager.

I guess you &amp; I could argue whether fairness is measurable (personally I believe very strongly in dismantling hereditary wealth inequality), but incentive based stuff absolutely can be tested.

Things like recidivism rates of criminals can be measured, comparing the results of prison sentences with those of various kinds of rehabilitation.

One of the great things about the current move to teaching ""academies"" is that allowing schools to operate as they wish will allow the results of various methodologies to be tested and measured. If a head teacher sees that the school down the road is getting better results by sending all the kids home with a study pack, then he can adopt it for himself and improve his own yield.

Nurses are getting screwed over too, nobody suggested otherwise. To suggest it is easier for one group or another is totally wrong, both work damn hard for their specific job roles and I think there is too much shitting on each other / competition for a healthy working relationship.

picky about shifts being worked? who do you know wants to work 8-8 on a friday and saturday night when they should be having a life?
They are forced to do some of those shifts , there is no choice about it.
So picky, mean it how you want but it makes no difference you will not get a say in your shifts.

I'm glad you have taken something from this, I'm trying to be constructive by providing you with facts.
Being paid more in the long run has its own problems as well, you know a doctor can get paid 120k / year as a Reg at a drug company right? 
They are in the NHS because they want to be, they have the qualifications and intellectual capacity to earn a lot, lot more. 
I'm sure its no different for a lot of really good nurses. 

You can have your opinion, but this well paid and picky shift thing from the other side of things is true to an extent, but not the whole story.
btw there is talk of removing overtime / etc for weekends and nights for doctors AND nurses.

null,false,[deleted],null,null,null,"I've taken the stance, and I will stick to it for the rest of the year, that Rodgers does not deserve to, should not, and will not be sacked. People will point to the amount of money he spent this summer, but if you look at the players we bought, it very obvious that the intent was not to challenge for the league again, but to secure our future as a perennial top four side. Selling the third best player in the world in the prime of his career and replacing him with youth is not done without both eyes on the future. FSG have done a brilliant job in making level-headed, that keep in mind the future of the team with the Red Sox, and I think they have learned from their first few years. We're never going to going to get a 6th Champions League without stable management, and smart investment in youth. Liverpool, in their current state, don't have the ability to outspend United, City, or Chelsea, but I don't think we have to in order to hang with them. Almost the entire team is well before (Coutinho, Markovic, Sterling, Can) their prime or about to enter it (Henderson, Sakho, Sturridge, Balotelli, Lovren, Lallana, and Migs). 
Meanwhile, Rodgers has a real strength in man management. The fact that Henderson, who was thrown to the scrap heap in the summer of 2012, is three year later set to become our captain speaks volumes. He, along with Coutinho, Sturridge, Mignolet, and Sterling have had significant development with Rodgers at the helm.
Finally, everything is being overblown. We went five years without a fourth place finish. Last year we were inches from winning the title, and eleven months later we're calling for the same managers head for being only a four points off of a free-falling fourth place in a transition year? In each of Rodgers' three years at Liverpool, there has been significant roster turnover. Let's see what he can do with a young team of his own that has one more year under its belt, in a year that City's top four place should be vulnerable.
Side note: When Rodgers lost his best player, he went from 2nd to 5th, when Klopp did (and a worse player at that), he dropped to 10th.",null,0,null,1429462452,null,0,false,0,cqhktow,null,t3_334xlg,null,t1_cqhktow,null,t3_334xlg,null,null,null,1432481048,null,14,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,14,null

I didn't know they banned unionists. That's equally unacceptable in my book.

I can't find any information about that though? Can you send me a link where I can find more info. I can only find info on the old Rule 21 that's gone.

null,false,tripstreet,num1,,null,"Great to get back to some winning form, even though we were fairly shaky at times.  Paulinho had some brighter spots in the first half as far as playing some forward cutting passes (even though he missed on a lot of them), but he made way too many mistakes in his passing and he single handedly killed a counter attack or two as well.  In the second half he wasn't nearly as tenacious defensively and made even more poor turnovers.  Also seemed to take way too long on the ball with his decision making and reverted to his more backwards oriented passing style.  Mason may not be exactly what we need in midfield but he fits our system much better slotted in that spot; relentless pressing, always looking to transition forward with his passing, and to me makes less mistakes. Paulinho was better overall than in times past but I still don't think he should be in Poch's starting 11.

Lamela....I want to like him so much but time after time he makes the same mistakes...Way too much ineffective dribbling at players, gets muscled off challenges way too often, turns over the ball with bad passing choices to start opposition counter attacks....poor finishing in the 1v1 with Krul in the second half.  Poch and the rest of the coaching staff really need to work with him in the offseason because right now he's a mess.  

Bentaleb did really well defensively in the midfield today.  Was impressed with his performance.

that's another thing you guys have drastically underestimated. suarez was the new gerrard. he'd bail us out of games. he'd pull individual genius. combined with sturridge and coutinho, who were both smart purchases, that exploded into an offensive force to be reckoned with. So much so that rodgers completely fucking neglected the back line, and played gerrard as DM. we were leaking goals left and right. but yeah, we won right? we were so lucky suarez was so fucking good that we didn't get outscored when teams were actually challenging us.

rodgers' purchases have been terrible save for those two. we can't even get an average performance from the rest, except for lambert, who was dirt cheap to begin with. that's millions squandered. coutinho and sturridge can't add up to one suarez. suarez was better than those two combined. yeah they're young, but they've got a team behind them too.

that 10 game run of form? new formation, after a desperate run of games where rodgers panicked to find something to win with. he was halfway in the noose. and it's the final stretch, and guess what, it's been out-tacticted now. that's 3 losses, one lucky win against swansea (who outplayed us), and newcastle, who have been so bad since pardew left it shouldn't even count. the win against blackburn was also dire. nothing. it took coutinho's brand of magic to pull us out of that one, and we've been relying on that lately. sooner or later, that's gonna run out of steam as well.

He was my choice. I don't ever think that I have seen him so free in any game so far. I have seen what he can bring offensively when he plays for us in Africa, but for Tottenham he usually sits deep. Today he was making tackles and interceptions on one side of the pitch, then dribbling, shooting, and making plays right on the opponent's 18. Should definitely have an assist, and probably a goal too. Flicking, chipping, and launching the ball into space (sad face) were all part of his excellent game today.

I have to disagree with the 'we eat oil'. The majority of fossil fuels go into tar, petrol diesel, paragon, candles, etc, not oils for plants. It contains none of the Nitrogen, potassium or Phosphorus plants need and as oil is immissible in water, plants can't absorb it, so it makes no sense.

There are dozens of potential offside decisions every game from every different angle of the pitch. You need a human to instantly decide and make those decisions, because technology will never be able to give an offside decision as instantly as a linesman. And the whole point of offside decisions is that they are suppose to be instant.  

We should just stand around looking at video replay for every marginal offside call? That would make the game ridiculous. Plus I haven't heard any Reading fans complaining about the two offsides or Debuchy hand-ball from yesterday. Bad offside decisions happen, you need the linesman because generally speaking he gets 90% of them right.  

&gt; Or do you not remember the 2nd half of the 2005 Champions league? Don't think we would've made it to extra time without that penalty.   

What kind of argument is this? How the hell does anyone know if we would have made it to extra time without the penalty. We may well have found another way to score.  

You know what did decide the 2005 Champions League final? - Our atrocious defending in the first half and Kaka playing like a god in the first half along with Crespo's finishing. *That* was why we 3-0 down.  

And the factors that decided the rest of the game was Gerrard keeping his cool with the header, Dida making a hash of Smicer's shot, and Alonso keeping his head after the penalty save. Not to mention Dudek's save in the 118th minute and Carra's heroics. *And people only moan about refereeing decisions after a loss. After we won the Champions League final was anyone moaning about Nesta's blatant handball on Garcia just before they broke away and scored their second? No, because we ended up winning the game. We were fucked by a blatant missed penalty in the 38th minute but that didn't matter because it was the proceeding effort of our players that was responsible for winning the Champions League.   

We won the Champions League final based on fucking merit, not because of referee decisions. Just like we are out of the FA Cup this season based on merit.   

We finished second last season based on merit. Sure, Sterling was onside at the Etihad, and everyone claims that that goal would've resulted in a 3 point swing at the end of the season, but we ultimately lost that game because we didn't take our chances, Sterling missed an open goal and Mignolet fumbled Negredo's goal.

Our midfield was awful because players were moved out of position to compensate for Gerrard. Allen and Henderson were both initially played deep, completely neutering them. Gerrard was then shifted to holding midfield which left us completely exposed and allowed our midfield to be trampled.

I'm not saying that Klopp wouldn't likely be a step up from Rodgers but it's incredibly unfair, imo, to try and oust Rodgers at the present moment.

Generally, these conditions will be grades you need to achieve in your final exams. For instance, one of my offers is conditional on getting the grades A*AA across any of my 4 A2 subjects. This means that, as long as I get those grades, I will get in. If I miss them, it's up to the university's discretion but generally you would lose the place. 

**Unconditional:** You are guaranteed an offer at the university, full-stop. There are no (academic) conditions you need to fulfill to get your place. Technically, it's still conditional on you being able to provide the funds for your studies but if you're a domestic student, the government will take care of that for you (in most cases). Generally, there are only two cases in which you'd get a conditional offer. If you've applied *after* your final exams then you will have already fulfilled any necessary conditions so the offer will be unconditional. Also, some universities are starting to give out unconditional offers to their best applicants to persuade students into accepting them over universities that are higher ranked. For instance, Birmingham is a very good university in the UK (Russell Group) but they will lose some of their best applicants to places like LSE or Imperial, so they hope that unconditional offers might encourage students to pick them instead.

There are many reasons why you might be ""unhappy"" with an offer. In the UK, most students will apply to 5 universities (the maximum allowed in most cases). Generally, there will be one or two they really want and the rest are there in case they don't get into their top choices. So unless you get rejected by most of them, you will have to end up declining offers. There are other reasons too.

null,false,Moondogunit,null,null,null,"A P60 is given to employees who are employed on the 5th of April (the last day of the UK tax year). It is produced by each employer that has you on their books on 5 April. If you left employment before 5 April then the employer you stopped working for will give you a P45 and you will not receive a P60 from them. 
The important parts of the P60 are as follows:

*Pay in this employment - will show your taxable gross pay from that employer only before tax received between 6 April and 5 April. However if you started working for that employer after 6 April it will then instead show gross pay from that date until 5 April.

*Tax deducted in this employment - tax deducted by this employer between 6 April (or the date you started work for that employer if after 6 April) and 5 April.

*Previous pay and tax boxes - can show pay and tax from (a) previous employer(s) if you changed jobs in the year.

*Total pay and tax - just a total of pay in this employment and any pay and tax from previous employment(s)

*National Insurance Section - In addition to tax employees will pay National Insurance (NI). Simplified - National Insurance payments among other things pay towards your entitlement to certain state benefits such as Jobseekers Allowance.

You will pay NI through your salary on amounts over certain limits. The box ""Employee's contributions due on all earnings above the PT"" shows what NI has been deducted by that employer in the year - it is what you have already paid through your salary in the year.
NI is worked out by your employer every time you are paid and therefore unlike tax you cannot get a refund of NI (except in unusual / exceptional circumstances) because you'll have paid the right amount already - therefore it is shown as ""due"" because it's what you will have paid in respect of that employment - and you won't be getting any of it back.

The tax deducted box isn't shown as tax ""due"" because it might not be what tax is due. You could have paid too much or too little tax (for example if your tax code was wrong).

- Paulinho is joint first for goals from all CM's in our squad. He was our third highest PL goal scorer last season.

- Paulinho is the best corner taker in our team.

- Paulinho regularly plays when we kept clean sheets. If not for another wrongful decision we would have gained another today. Paulinho presses the midfield aggressively and often makes key interceptions in this area. He also is the CM most likely to be found in our own box.

- Despite popular opinion claiming otherwise. Paulinho actually does exhibit a good passing range and regularly plays the ball forward.


Overall the verdict is quite clear to me, Paulinho should be getting played ahead of Mason in the CM role.

It doesn't necessarily mean that your employer has not deducted tax and NI and reported your details to HMRC, it simply means you didn't pass the security questions. 

It could be that your record is not up to date, for example have you moved and not told HMRC, changed your phone number and not told HMRC? 

Another common thing is that employers often use different names. You may well work for Mega Emporium Stores (totally made up name!) and that may be the name on the store front, but this store may be owned by Bloggs Retail Ltd and you may be telling HMRC you work for Mega Emplorium Stores but HMRC have you working for Bloggs Retail Ltd - so naturally you won't pass security.

My advice would be to write to them, tell them your current address, telephone number, current employer (include all names they are owned by / known by and the PAYE reference shown on the P60 and include a P60 copy) and when you started working there, tell them what employers you worked for between 06/04/2014 and 05/04/2015 and whether or not that was your only income and ask if they can check if you have overpaid tax.",null,0,null,1429466077,null,0,false,0,cqhmqcd,null,t3_31w7x3,null,t1_cqhmqcd,null,t3_31w7x3,null,null,null,1432481946,null,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1,null

No one expects scientists to immediately create a brilliant battery, but the private industry has created many cars and the market is clearly there, as shown by Elon Musk's success as well as the smart vehicles and the general trend towards Electric and Green vehicles. It also serves better service to the countries as it decrease reliance on some of the worst abusers of human rights such as Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E.

Ok, but that's one problem and thousands of others are not addressed.

&gt;The U.K itself is a post-industrial nation, 

The general population are going back to the third world and the rich elites are the ones making money from the labour of the Chinese. India and China are fucked up but I am here and I see what's here while I am here. 

&gt;No one expects scientists to immediately create a brilliant battery, but the private industry has created many cars and the market is clearly there...

Using electric cars is just as polluting as non electric cars, it's just moving the pollution to some other place. Meanwhile, I would expect scientists to have developed better batteries during the massive leaps in technology of the 20th century but we have plucked the low hanging fruit and I suspect that it's not a given that progress is our birthright. Actually, we may have just reached the limit and that's why cars are still the same as when they were invented but with a computer tacked on the side. 

&gt;And I'm pretty sure all consequences are considered with new technologies, and if dangers do show up, instead of abandoning the project completely we simply work around them and develop better methods with compromising development. That would just be short-sighted.

So far, the consequences have not been considered. How do you think the people involved have managed to increase their intellects and emotional capacities to deal with such things? Is it a miracle?

 On issues such as gender, race and class some people believe in equality of opportunity for example, while others believe in equality of outcome (eg enforcing company boards to be 40% female).

Yeah, he has had a number of shit performances this year, but keep in mind he is young (only 23) and is essentially in his first year in the Prem as he was injured last year. The talent is there, and we have seen glimpses of it this year, although admittedly against weaker competition.the number one thing he has to improve on is his strength on the ball, which will come down to his summer workouts, as it's hard to build strength during the season. 

It will be interesting to see what happens with him this summer, as he is going into the offseason healthy this year and can work on improving his game rather than just getting healthy. His ceiling is probably higher than Townsend's, but he does have areas he must improve in, especially his strength and decision making. The strength is easier to fix, as it's more physical, but his decision making would improve if he would just relax and play within himself. But the raw skill he has is tantalizing and I don't think Spurs should just give up on that. 

He may never reach Bale's level (which I think many were hoping for due to his being our record signing) but he can be a solid winger. If nothing else he can provide competition for Townsend if he can improve a bit. I'm just not ready to give up on him because he is young and is adjusting to the Prem game. That being said, he has his work cut out for him to improve this summer if he wants to play for us consistently. 

TL;DR: Be patient with Lamela. He is young, talented, and finishing his first full year. Give him a healthy summer period to improve before writing him off.

There's no protection against MITM for existing contactless payment cards, so far as I'm aware. (Unless you're pressing a button or doing something on or to the card, or doing something else on a side channel, how could there be?) On this sort of technology (NFC, RFIDs, etc) they often talk about the limited range as a security measure, but various people have demonstrated much longer ranges with customised equipment, or shown how the limited range isn't always such a problem for an attacker.

Other parts of the threat model might be, say, a dishonest family member you don't want to report to the police. Before contactless, your cards would be somewhat safe from abuse by such a person, but with contactless you may be in a position of having to point the finger at your family member in order to be reimbursed.

Or the additional risk of small fraudulent transactions that you don't notice on your bill (and so don't get reimbursed for).

Basically, I hate contactless payment cards as a non-optional feature. (A couple of small holes in the card to break the antenna connection can stop them working for normal contactless payment - but specialised equipment may be able to do better with it.)

The bigger worry for me with all this stuff is the trend of banks trying to push liability for fraud onto customers.

Paulinho is a decent player at best. He had his time in early 2013 and played well. Picked up an injury and it slowed him down. He was able to come back and since then has never put in an overwhelmingly incredible performance. 

I've never fully trusted any of the CMs we have outside of Bentaleb because none of them are that good. The fact is that Mason is the best compliment we have and that's why he plays week after week. None of the other 4 show much when they play and that's why we don't have the rotation.  

I'm not denying that he played a good game today. He did, he played well. But those performances are scarce. He rarely shows this ability when he plays - if he did then he'd have accumulated up more than 20 appearances this year. 

He's done little to command the 2nd CM spot as you assert week after week. He hasn't. No matter how much you scream for it, its not going to happen.

His record argues that he's massively improved many of our players and players like Markovic, Can, Sterling, Ibe, Moreno, Coutinho are still in their early 20s. They're only going to get better, all of them.

His record argues that in his first season we started against Manchester City with Sterling, Downing and Suarez up front and came out with a draw. City are the richest team in the league and two years in a row we've beaten them at home.

This year we've played the entire season without a striker. Balotelli simply isn't good enough and Lambert doesn't have the legs to play from the start and despite the lack of goals, despite the lack of firepower we're somehow 5th. In **the most** competitive league in Europe, to be where we are is incredible and the person behind that is Rodgers. His record argues that he's boxing with the heavyweights while wearing gloves that don't even fit. 

We don't have Yaya Toure, Di Maria, Fabregas, Ozil, we've got Joe Allen and Jordan Henderson and somehow, we're competing. Somehow we're still in the top 5 teams.

She's serious about the argument she is making, not about the rhetoric.

&gt; Does Katie Hopkins truly believe that just because these people have come from a different country, that they don't have the same rights as us

People from different countries don't have the same rights as us. 

&gt; Do other people in the UK actually believe this?

It isn't an article of faith, it's a fact. That's often precisely *why* they want to come to the UK, because the UK does offer rights that other countries don't have. 

&gt; It'd be interesting to see a UK without immigration, like Hopkins probably wants.

Like UKIP, I doubt very much that Hopkins wants zero immigration, far more likely that she wants immigration controlled so that only people that will benefit the UK can immigrate. 

&gt; Does anyone agree with Katie Hopkins?

That people trying to enter the country illegal should be sent back? I think most Brits agree with that and certainly most The Sun readers.

What I mean by that is Rodgers seemingly hasn't gotten the players that he wants. It's been well documented that he wanted Vorm, Williams, Siggurdson and Dempsey. But he didn't get any of those, and that's the biggest problem. How can Rodgers build HIS team, with his vision without the players that he wants? The way I see it is if we are 5th or 6th, then Rodgers can say 'I didn't want those players. It's not my fault we are where we are now'.

What we need is for FSG to say to Rodgers 'Here's 40 Mill for the summer transfer. You can buy whoever you want, for however much you want. If you want to spend it on 1 player for 300 grand a week, you can. If you want 5 players on 50 grand a week, go ahead. But Alan here is the finance guy. He'll tell you your limitations, how much money you have and how much you can spend. But I remind you of this: If we get top 4, your job is safe. If we narrowly miss out on top 4, I want an explanation. If we come any lower than 5th, you might lose your job'.


That way, Rodgers either sinks or swims with regards to decisions on who to sign. Because I can guarantee you this, if we got a player who fits Rodgers' system and scores goals (instead of Balotelli), we would be challenging for the top 4 and maybe even the title. It's an absolute travesty that Rodgers, who said that we were't signing Balotelli, was forced to take him on at the last minute because of the transfer committee's ineptness to find a player similar to Suarez (stylistically).",null,0,null,1429469812,null,0,1429470046,0,cqhoqi9,null,t3_33588s,null,t1_cqhoqi9,null,t3_33588s,null,null,null,1432482891,null,55,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,55,null

He did it once. He happened to find great players with very cheap cost. Do you think it was him who just happened to know they are that good? He was at a club where he could afford to make mistakes.

So who is this *talent* that he has pulling power over? What does it even mean? That's so abstract point.

&gt; Current squad motivated to play for him (the new manager boost) 

Completely irrelevant. Happens rarely.

What's wrong with Rodgers? He's one of the best behaved and talked managers. That David Brent part... Are you a fucking child?

&gt; Rodgers brought us our highest finish in years ( mostly due to saurez imo)

So you're one of those guys who thinks that Suarez was the manager last year? Who worked out the system to use players in right positions? Who tried diamond when it looked rather unlikely to even work? Who put Sterling under the striker to get the best performances out of him? Who got the entire team playing better than they have for years? Suarez? You're having a laugh.

His bigger money signings didn't make instant impact and had injury problems as they missed their best player for months. Wouldn't say it was that much different. Rodgers' Liverpool showed that they can play football even when heavily handicapped. That's what they are. We've fucked up transfers for years (for one reason or another). We bought 2 players who weren't fitting in our system because we fucked up the transfers. We fucked up the deal with Konoplyanka because we just couldn't make the offer earlier - that was ridiculous.

There is one massive problem with democracy, populism. Populism is unavoidable, although it can be mitigated with the right education and various other measures. If we had just two elected houses, then the parties would do whatever they could to get as many votes as possible. They would appeal to the fears and whims of the day in order to get votes, leading to an overall weaker country. The House of Lords is a buffer from this precisely because it is unelected. It is under no obligation to pass what the voters want, and can draw from a wide range of experience to try to do what they believe is best for the country, due to how they have a vested interest in seeing it prosper and therefor them and their families prosper. Although I am sounding like a one nation tory, there are countermeasures in place that restrict the power of the lords from becoming an oligarchy, such as the removal of hereditary peers and how everything that goes through the Lords must also go through the Commons. Thats the theoretical reasoning for the Lords existence, if it works or not is a different matter. On a more practical note I fear that changing the House of Lords is a one way system.

I know a bit about it, actually. There are several areas that the system is overpriced - not just the pharmaceuticals. My fiancée is terminally ill, so we actually (unfortunately) have a lot of experience in this area.

My favorite recent bill is a blood draw (from a place that only does blood draws) that was billed as a minor surgery. The total cost to test a few vials of blood was... ~$400 (about £260) IIRC. There was a copay, and insurance covered the rest...

Surgical procedures are overpriced as well, from what I understand of the actual costs between our system and yours. I know we also have an unfortunately bad habit of sending a lot of people to emergency rooms when they don't need emergency care. This is especially common in lower income areas where a doctor office may be closed for walkins or not accessible by bus route and there isn't an accessible Urgent Care clinic (i.e. walkins, but not emergencies).",null,0,null,1429470976,null,0,false,0,cqhpdaa,null,t3_3347ae,null,t1_cqhpdaa,null,t1_cqhmtk0,null,null,null,1432483190,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Then I re -watched his masterclass of a performance against Germany. I'm still not sure about that.

From what I've read on the transfer committee, it is made up of people who aren't football guys. They have no knowledge of the game and I'm specifically talking about systems. They probably looked at Balotelli and thought 'You know what, he scored some great goals against Germany, he's scored goals in a poor Milan team, he's an international etc....' but not at what type of player he is. How can anyone credibly say that, after watching Suarez and Sturridge last season, Mario Balotelli would've fitted into our mobile, pressing system? It's beyond belief, and the blame is not on Rodgers at all. When an amateur coach like myself can tell you that, then how have we employed people paid millions to make dreadful decisions like that!?

Woah, hang on a second there. 'They're just not good enough in the long run.' Do you have any proof of that? When Rodgers' made his team at Swansea, he chose who he wanted and formed a decent team. It's entirely possible that Rodgers needs somebody to spot players that fits into his system (see Clough and Taylor partnership), but we're not even sure that is the case. I think we need a Director of Football to work with Rodgers. FSG seemingly don't want to allow him to make his own decision, and if he works with a DoF, somebody who knows the game (like Cruyff, LVG or even Rafa (now that would be interesting!)) and picks players for his system, then it can work.

What makes our transfers so disappointing is that we had a very good chance to push on this year. We just finished second, guaranteed CL and playing fantastic football. Also, we received 75m from Barcelona for Suarez.

I think the mistake we made was trying to buy a bench and not first-teamers. We needed at least 1 world class player.

So many quality players moved this summer for good prices:

Griezmann- went for a fee similar to what we paid for Lallana and earns less

Mandzukic- went for a fee similar to what we paid for Balotelli and earn a similar wage. He suited our style better

Fabregas- I'll rather pay him 200k per week than pay Lallana 90k p/w because he is a proven world class player. I feel we could have cojvinced him due to the Chelsea-Arsenal rivalry

Costa- Understandable we missed out on him

Sanchez- 35m for a proven player. We wanted him, but, he didn't want us.

Remy- too bad we didn't get him.

Completely agree, but if someone is investing a few hundred quid into shares, they should be looking into index funds (something that our mutual friends over in /r/investing love). That way you're still investing in shares, but it's part of a larger fund that invests across the whole stock exchange.

If they release these shares to the public, I'd buy some. But that aside I totally agree that an individual buying an individual share is no different to putting everything on red.

As an aside, I don't personally agree that this is as risky a share as you think it is. It will be (apparently) sold at a lower amount than its intrinsic value, plus the stock is still in the throes of being suppressed following the crisis. Banking isn't going anywhere, so short of Lloyds spectacularly fucking everything up and going under of its own doing (rather than through a systemic crisis), it will hold its value at bare minimum, and I would be genuinely surprised if it didn't go up.

But I'm not a professional speculator or investor, therefore my opinion is worth fuck all.

made a champions league final beating real madrid on the semifinal, made the quarterfinals being barely edged by real madrid again after losing mario goetze and got out of his group this very season after losing lewandowski, with a god awful team several levels below rodgers' liverpool.

&gt; He happened to find great players with very cheap cost. Do you think it was him who just happened to know they are that good?

do you have any clue of what it means to 'build a squad'? it's not only about transfers, it's about getting the best of them. liverpool's current squad potential is not any lower than dortmund's last season.

again, what are you talking about? he competed directly against bayern munich, who despite making the CL final in 2010 finished 3rd behind leverkusen in 2010-11, klopp's first german title and a season schalke 04 made the CL semifinals. he won the league again in 2012, when bayern munich once again featured in a CL final. in 2012-13, germany had 3 teams in the CL group stage and all 3 advanced to round of 16, with klopp's dortmund and superpower bayern munich bulldozering to the final. similarly last season, germany had 4 clubs qualified for the group stage and all 4 advanced.

I have many colleagues that still go back to France/Belgium under their EHIC card (or just outright pay for it), just to use medical care there.

NHS gives you a nice ""wow I got free stuff"" feeling, because you can walk in somewhere and pay nothing. We're not used to that in todays society. I'm glad to pay for this for other people, but you are slightly chauvinistic if you think that NHS quality is a good standard.

Maybe it's just that London is overcrowded and it causes quality to degrade. Maybe it's much better outside of London. I'm sure quality isn't universal throughout the UK. All I know, is in my personal and anecdotal experience, I'm not a large fan of the quality.

I think the main issues lie with:

- Speed of getting an appointment.

- Age of the equipment. (This might just be an impression, the possibly dated equipment might have equal quality.)

- You feel like you are in a factory.

2) I just looked up examples of it but it's really as simple as writing what each portion of your code does. I did both flow charts and pseudo code and the former is definitely easier

3) my writeups for both were around 40 pages each, mainly due to diagrams

Other tips:

• with python, at the end of each line, use a ""#"" symbol to then summarise what that line does

• Rather than copying and pasting your programmes to your writeup, use pastebin to give them proper syntax highlighting and then paste that

• You don't need to practise testing, just do it. Make a table with the columns: Test Number, What you're testing, What you're inputting, what you expect to happen, and what happens. Test the following things: The maximum and minimum values for what should be accepted, unacceptable values and unacceptable characters (such as words instead of numbers)

I ask because my car is 17 years old and has 41k on the clock, 4k of which have come in the last 6 months since I've had access to it. It rarely did any actual driving before I owned it, but it was driven around to keep it everything in good order regularly and at the very least it was started and left to run for a while with the idea that it would go some way to preventing the issues you described. 

It's mechanically sound, thankfully. Other than broken exhaust which I'm sure I managed to do anyway, no service/MOT/inspection or otherwise has found anything of concern, not even rust in other areas. 

How likely is it that it came down to being ran daily and driven short distances regularly... or is it just luck?

And the electric we use for those cars can come from safer resources, such as Solar, Hydro, Kinetic or, in the future Bio-Fuels. That then makes them much less polluting for the environment and eliminating cars would not only stop that research completely but also mean the complete loss of cars. Something the global economies just can not afford, and that would certainly not help the poor. 

&gt;that's why cars are still the same as when they were invented but with a computer tacked on the side.

Cars are in no way the same, any shape or form, to how they were back in the early Twentieth century, that's just a completely untrue comment, even if you don't include the computers on the inside. The Engines are more efficient, the metals used are better, the shape, form they have used since then are different, the organs of the car are in no way similar to the early Twentieth century ones, any larger changes then it wouldn't be a car. 

&gt;So far, the consequences have not been considered. How do you think the people involved have managed to increase their intellects and emotional capacities to deal with such things? Is it a miracle?

All consequences have been considered? You're acting like Scientists don't try and work all of this out before carrying out their research, it takes years upon years and lots of testing to minimise any damage done to everyone? So no, it's not a miracle. It's Humans just researching something before they do it, something they do all the time. 

&gt;Using electric cars is just as polluting as non electric cars, it's just moving the pollution to some other place. Meanwhile, I would expect scientists to have developed better batteries during the massive leaps in technology of the 20th century

They're trying their hardest with the technology that they have, give them a break. No one just comes up with the idea of an electric car, it's not something someone can sit down and do in 10 minutes or even a year, it takes research to find the risks, it takes years to find the materials, and do the Maths behind it all.

With him being a Tottenham fan, it has surprised me that he hasn't seen what a *little* bit more investment can do in terms of taking a team from distinctively mid table to challenging for Europe or at least on the periphery. That would also then make them more appealing from a potential buyer (although still probably way off that £400m pricetag he has on them). 

As an aside, from a football pov, De Jong has been a huge miss for them this year too and I think he'll be like a new signing for them next season so who even knows. Especially if Lascelles can come in and be the player they want him to be at center half. 

**Edit:** I didn't really like Newcastle much for my football supporting life, most perceptions were that age old bigger team in a city/feelings of entitlement etc that came with being better than Sunderland and their success in the 90s.
