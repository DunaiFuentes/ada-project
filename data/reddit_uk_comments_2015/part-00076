All players go through these, and it affects different players differently, some players, (Suarez can be the ultimate example) can get worked up and overly aggressive and sent off. Players like Gerrard can sometimes try to do too much, and force the play/take it off other people's toes. Then there are players like Torres who start to over-think things/sulk and become anonymous. All players have weakness/cracks that begin to show when things aren't going their way, and this happens to be Studge's. 

People are making so many personal assumptions about him, when the problem likely is that HE feels under pressure because EVERYONE (including this sub) has been making such a big deal out of his return, and he now probably feels like  every game he goes without scoring he's letting people down, which makes him more frustrated, which makes him play worse, it's a vicious cycle which is only perpetuated by people making insanely personal criticisms like this.

Bradley explains itself. Some absolutely crucial goals, more often that not screamers. He's up there with Grabban and Hooper for goals and even when we haven't been playing well he's often been fighting, and still scoring like in the 2-1 loss to Reading. He's having a great season.  

Cameron Jerome because 16 goals can't be ignored! When we signed him I didn't really understand why we needed more strikers but he's been incredible. Starting or off the bench. His attitude, particularly after his goal against Blackburn, has been one that suggests he wants to stay and get promoted.  

Grabban because when he's been given a run in the team he has delivered. He was our goal outlet when we were top in September and went out of favour with Adams. Now given a chance against he's started scoring again and is doing it with a smile on his face.   

Russ because he's been a great captain, happy to be played RB or CB and seems to have a real presence with the team.

Utterly despicable note he made on Autism

&gt; [Is my right hon. Friend aware that there is clear evidence that homeopathy is effective in treating autism, especially when doctors have not found a solution? Now that the Society of Homeopaths is regulated by the Professional Standards Authority, will he make more use of homeopathy in the health service generally, and in this particular instance?](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm150113/debtext/150113-0001.htm#15011343000271)

And on pushing homeopathy...:

&gt; [Does my right hon. Friend have any plans to increase personal health budgets, and will he ensure that there is greater awareness of the health professions that are regulated by the Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council, the Health and Care Professions Council and the Professional Standards Authority, which has recently accredited the Society of Homeopaths and the British Acupuncture Council?](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm141125/debtext/141125-0001.htm#14112530000311)

And apparently applying science to homeopathy is not fair because:

&gt; [With homeopathic medicine, which I have long supported and advocated, it is impossible to run trials on every dilution: some are so dilute that they do not show up.](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm141121/debtext/141121-0001.htm#14112160001302)


On Tea Tree Oil as an alternative to antibiotics

&gt; [Does my right hon. Friend agree that a critical problem that A and E units will face in the future is antibiotic resistance? Is he aware that the Science and Technology Committee, of which I am a member, has been looking at this issue, and it also interests the Health Committee, of which I am also a member? Can he assure me that he is talking to the Prime Minister about how to stimulate new antibiotic research, and will he also remember that nature has its own remedies, such as tea tree oil?](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm140610/debtext/140610-0001.htm#14061052000242)


Previously on Astrology when on a jolly:

&gt; [In this instance it is just possible that Jonathan Cainer [Daily Mail horoscope writer] has something that people do believe in, and I have made a study of astrology in connection with health care over the past 20 years. I was on the last parliamentary delegation to Hong Kong before the Chinese took it back, and Governor Chris Patten said, “David, what would you like to do? Do you want to go up to the Stanley barracks, go out on a frigate or to the new territories?” I said, “No, Governor. I would like to see your astrologer.” And as Governor of Hong Kong he had one. I went to meet the astrologer and he was very concerned about the buildings around Government House.](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm140722/debtext/140722-0002.htm#14072262000784)

And last but not least on the fact of blood not clotting during a full moon and we need to put money into working out whats going on:

&gt; [In 2001 I raised in the House the influence of the moon, *on the basis of the evidence then that at certain phases of the moon there are more accidents*. Surgeons will not operate because blood clotting is not effective and the police have to put more people on the street. I am arguing for more research. I have been criticised for raising the subject, but the criticism is generally based on a misunderstanding. It is based on the idea that I am talking about the stuff that we see in the newspapers about star sign astrology, but I am not. I am talking about a long-standing discipline-an art and a science-that has been with us since ancient Egyptian, Roman, Babylonian and Assyrian times.](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091014/debtext/91014-0022.htm#09101453000053)

And just in case you think he is some cuddly harmless old fool here he is attacking some NHS doctors:

&gt; [However, homeopathy has been under attack, despite the new Royal London Homeopathic hospital. The hospital and those who support homeopathy have faced difficult times, not least the attacks by the so-called scientific establishment and a letter that purported to come from the NHS-it had the NHS logo on it-in May 2007 which was signed by many retired professors of medicine. That letter should never have been sent out under the NHS letterhead.](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091014/debtext/91014-0022.htm#09101453000053)

When he joined us we were playing terribly under AVB and he got absolutely no service, but he was still scoring goals - mostly penalties in the prem of course, but I remember seeing him bag a hatrick in the Europa league. This was all while he was new to the premier league, didn't speak a word of English and adjusting to a new managers style of play. Then that manager got sacked and Sherwood came in and gave the lead to Ade. Meanwhile off the pitch his wife had a miscarriage. 

Come the end of the season the manager is sacked again and it's back to square one. Under Poch he has improved but his confidence took a severe beating in the meantime. However in the last three matches he's played with a huge amount of confidence and nearly scored four goals (one went in, two very good saves, and the other one we all know about). In my eyes that's not too bad. Our crosses into the box last night were dreadful, I think Chiriches was the only one to get a decent ball in (another player that everyone loves to shit on when he's done an admiral job of stepping in at right back without complaint and was actually massively involved in our attack yesterday).

Bottom line though, get off his back. He's a Tottenham player like the rest, and still plays his heart out. There's obviously a reason he's still named in the squad when the likes of Kaboul, Capoue and Ade are MIA. Kane can't play every minute of every match and starting him tonight would have been suicide for the (far more important) final on Sunday. Yes he'll likely be gone in the summer, but the fans voices won't play any part in that decision (look and Sandro and Holtby as examples). Until then, just keep supporting him and your team.

I used to be a mountaineering instructor and ran a company organising expedition logistics in the Sahara so spent years using a GPS outdoors, often in the dark and on the tops of Scottish mountains in winter training aspirant Mountain Leaders.  In terms of ""fun"" caching, in 2006 I set up a 3 week off road drive round Algeria, Libya and Mali that covered an area of desert the size of France (with no roads, villages or anything really) where the participants had to look for fuel, water and beer we had buried the year before otherwise they wouldn't make it to the next cache.

I would also increase the CBT and A1 to ~250cc with a power/weight ratio to keep it sensible.

The bikes required for the test should also be re-examined. Currently, if you are upgrading your licence, you need to sit it on a bike that's more powerful than your current. This puts a hurdle on people going through the tests themselves.  

Edit: Reading through [an old consultation](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/motorcycle-lorry-and-bus-driving-licences-and-driving-test-rules/further-european-changes-to-driving-licences-and-driving-test-requirements), it seems that this is due to get worse, as a power requirement of 50kW is to be required [67BHP], with a minimum weight of 180kg.

If teams didn't drop down from the CL the group stage of the EL would be less pointless, and it'd ease the huge number of fixtures.

You could also have linked to the many media outlets who instead chose to focus on the 24% figure. It's hardly been hushed up. There are two sides to this coin; on the one hand, or turns out the majority of British Muslims are well integrated and hold values most of us would agree with. On the order hand, a significant minority don't. It's not black and white, and you can't blame the UK's public service broadcaster from publishing a balanced article reflective of the truth instead of solely trying to scare monger about the less significant finding here. We have the daily express for that.

I say give him until the end of the season and if he doesn't show any significant improvement, put him on the transfer market and again get as much as we can for him.

null,false,Kai-Tek,lfc99,,null,"Okay hear me out, I noticed a definite pattern with our centerbacks ever since Brendan took over. Literally every single one of our CBs struggled at some point and they struggled badly. This is not a criticism of Rodgers, it is simply an observation and I would love to see Carra write an article about it because it's right up his alley.

We all remember what happened to Skrtel, he was absolutely hopeless for an entire season, he just couldn't adapt to Brendan's style, even his last season was riddled with silly mistakes. Agger is another one who simply had to leave the club because Brendan wrote him off completely, his confidence hit rock-bottom. We're talking about Agger for Christ's sake, a player who could have joined Barcelona on more than one occasion. A player like Agger does not simply turn so horrible over night that he has to pack his back and go home to join a lower league team.

Then Sakho came in as a supposed solution for our ""horrible"" centerbacks but the guy struggled so hard and looked extremely shaky in his first season. I have never ever seen a more nervous player on the pitch than Sakho and I've been watching football all my life. There were a few games where he kept passing it short straight into the feet of opponents and often falling flat on his ass when panicking.

The same thing is now happening to Lovren. He is a commanding ball-playing centerback which was exactly what we needed for so long. Lovren's passing is excellent for a centreback, he showed that in preseason where he was absolutely brimming with confidence. He can pass long and switch flanks easily just like Gerrard can, that's what impressed me the most. I think he can become one of the best defenders in the game in the next few years. There's no doubt in my mind that a more defensive manager like Rafa or Jose would get the best out of him right away. He is obviously low on confidence currently because he hasn't played in basically any of the games where the team was winning, he was only a part of our first team early in the season when the entire team played badly.

So obviously it's a coaching issue for me, Brendan directly improved a lot of our attacking players but our centerbacks seem to have a hard time and they actually go backwards. Most pundits seem to think that we need a defensive coach to fix that ""flaw"" in Brendan's coaching style but Brendan obviously doesn't see it that way. His comment regarding that the other day is clear as day, he seemed insulted and a bit of ego/arrogance surfaced. I just don't think it's a coincidence anymore, there is probably no centerback out there that we can get who can walk into the team and play amazingly. It's almost comical if you ask me, Brendan ""auditioned"" A LOT of centerbacks any simply NO combination seems to work. We have spent a lot of money on Sakho and Lovren and both have struggled, even Kolo who is very experienced has found it pretty tough. His temporary fix that he is using right now is to use 3 of them by putting an ""extra body"" in that backline like he said himself the other day, but can we really use 3 of them long term? I have no idea.

It’s about how collectively a guy has been provoked. Granted, a mask may have slipped, but up until that point Joe had been subjected to some pretty unpleasant remarks and behaviour.

Yes, racism should be challenged. Yes, bigotry and discrimination are things to be actively discouraged. But there are ways and means, surely? I’m disappointed that Joe posted the vids, but as I’ve said before I will not change my behaviour and attitude to him, and continue to engage him in an adult manner. I might try to change his beliefs but I will not hold it against him if I fail, any more than if I tried to convert a Muslim to Judaism.

Regardless of what you think of him, you owe it to yourself to act like an adult, calmly and rationally, and treat him as you would any other human being. The moment you do otherwise you close the argument and turn it into a shouting match. We enlightened liberal lefty types expect that of the UKIP types, but when it comes down to acting like adults then Joe actually has us beaten for the most part. We can sneer at the howling mob of Daily Mail readers but we can howl pretty loudly ourselves too.

You do not stamp out racism by discrimination.

Why on Earth would I bring this up? Allow me a moment to be my usual Blunt self; I think most people on reddit are pathetic. I think most of the time they exalt the values of freedom of speech and expression, but only so long as it falls in line with a liberal society agenda.

You're permitted to say what you like about homosexuality, so long as you don't mention that you don't agree with it, and it's not your thing - a prime example of this was evident over the past year upon mentioning the subject of Gay marriage. You're allowed your opinion of Muslims, so long as it's a positive view that does not, under any circumstances hold a negative view of the society as a whole.

You're allowed your views of Israel, so long as you don't draw parallels with what they're doing to the Palestinians *at this very moment* to the way the Germans treated the Jews at the very beginning, before they began committing their atrocities.

Freedom of speech is nothing more than an illusion, and I had honestly - perhaps naively hoped that /r/britishpolitics would manage to avoid behaving in a way that happens all too often in /r/ukpolitics -it's fairly evident that the same bullshit has made its way here, in that anyone with an alternative view is down voted to oblivion and chastised for simply *voicing an opinion*. There's no discussion, no dialogue; not even the *illusion* of cordial discourse; simply diatribe for not subscribing to yet another liberal agenda pushing subreddit that gets their sensibilities offended the minute someone says or thinks something *different* from the status quo. Shame on you. Shame on you all - especially the mods who appear to have already forgotten why they wanted an alternative to /r/ukpolitics in the first place, and already shrugging off any pretence of impartiality.

edit: I have something more to say.

I want you to think about what the subreddit is for. Hell; I want you to consider what *reddit* is supposed to be for - it's supposed to be about discourse. It's supposed to be about gaining insight, *seeing* the different angles and discussing them evenly and not bandwagon voting for a fucking popularity contest.

You should welcome racists. You should *welcome* radical muslims, ex members of the IRA and even paedophile priests to the subreddit, because that's how you *learn*. That's how you understand *why* they think the way they do; celebrate the diversity and *savour* the challenge of someone with an opposing view that you stand a chance of maybe, just *maybe* changing the mind of by helping them see the flaws in their logic; or hell, even agreeing with them.

The reason I dislike this blog post is because it conflates the whole deficit and debt thing.  For all the crowing of austerity, we've not really seen much, most people think austerity means a reduction in how spending.  Not just a reduction on the increase in spending, in many areas, that's all we saw, in others, even less.

Much the same way the deficit was growing the debt (as we can't service the debt, we must take on more debt), the current government plans just reduced the increased spending, in fact, unless we view the spending in 'real' terms, it increased.  Viewing in real terms means to discount the effect of inflation.

As a result, imagine what would have happened if we had a program that really cut, say did away with tax credits, cut pensions or maybe didn't have the NHS ring-fenced, so that the NHS suffered some cuts too.

There is a nice blog post explaining a lot of the debt related stuff here:

As Strachan said last night some strikers want to ""score goals, and then play football"". It is their be all and end all.

Sturridge might sometimes appear selfish, but no-one calls him selfish when he scores. Atm he is scoring with every shot, so people call him selfish.

As for why he is so rusty, just think about how much football he has missed. For him, this is like starting pre-season all over again, with the added stress of worrying about an injury and a team which is reaching a really key point of their season. 

Against Besiktas yes his touch was poor, yes he turned when he should have shot, and yes he was out of the game a lot. But he is coming back, slowly. Leg injuries are the worst for a player like him, who relies on confidence so much, because they undermine you entirely. Give him a month or two, and then start criticising again.

&gt; Throughout most of its history, astrology was considered a scholarly tradition. It was accepted in political and academic contexts, and was connected with other studies, such as astronomy, alchemy, meteorology, and medicine.[3] At the end of the 17th century, new scientific concepts in astronomy and physics (such as heliocentrism and Newtonian mechanics) called astrology into question. Astrology thus lost its academic and theoretical standing, and common belief in astrology has largely declined.[4] **Astrology has been rejected by the scientific community as a pseudoscience, having no validity or explanatory power for describing the universe**. Among other issues, there is no proposed mechanism of action by which the positions and motions of stars and planets could affect people and events on Earth that does not contradict well understood basic aspects of biology and physics.[5]:249[6] **Scientific testing of astrology has found no evidence to support any of the premises or purported effects outlined in astrological traditions**. In one study, participating astrologers attempting to match natal charts with profiles generated by a psychological inventory produced results not significantly at variance with random chance.

The coalition pledged to reduce the DEFICIT, i.e what we spend vs what we make. They are doing this, all be it slowly, so per year the debt is decreasing, but this still accumulates to a larger debt.

For example. I earn £5000 a year, I spend £10000 a year I am in the red by £5000. I reduce my spending by £1000 in the first year to £9000 I am still £4000 in the red, £9000 overall. BUT I have reduced my spending i.e my deficit:

Year 1 Earnt £5000 Spent £10000 Overall debt £5000  Deficit £5000

Year 2 Earnt £5000 Spent £9000 Overall debt   £9000  Deficit £4000

Year 3 Earnt £5000 Spent £8000 Overall debt £12000  Deficit £3000

Year 4 Earnt £5000 Spent £7000 Overall debt £14000  Deficit £2000

Year 5 Earnt £5000 Spent £6000 Overall debt £15000  Deficit £1000

Year 6 Earnt £5000 Spent £5000 Overall debt £15000  Deficit £0

Year 7 Earnt £5000 Spent £4000 Overall debt £14000 (Budget surplus and I can actually start paying back my debt)

This is a very simplified version, which also disregards the interest rates we pay on our debts, but as you can see even with a reduced deficit my debt is increasing and it's not until I am actually in surplus I can start to pay back my debts. 
THIS is why the economy is so fucked, THIS is why we are still creating debt every year. The only way to start to reduce debt would be to magic a budget surplus... how do we do this? Reduce spending,  or increase earnings. 

TL;DR: Even by decreasing debt per year, your total debt is going to increase. The coalition are reducing the deficit which year on year will EVENTUALLY stop the accumulation of debt if continued. If they ran surplus some debt could be paid back.

http://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/astrology_checklist

&gt;Astrology is not a very scientific way to answer questions. Although astrologers seek to explain the natural world, they don't usually attempt to critically evaluate whether those explanations are valid — and this is a key part of science. The community of scientists evaluates its ideas against evidence from the natural world and rejects or modifies those ideas when evidence doesn't support them. Astrologers do not take the same critical perspective on their own astrological ideas.


http://www.astrosurf.com/nitschelm/astrology_english.html

&gt;Astrology, which has been built since its origin on completely irrational bases, is thus undoubtedly classified among the false sciences and cannot in any case be classified as a real science. Indeed, it remains completely inadmissible in a scientific vision of the Universe for a great number of reasons: divergences between astrologers, hazardous and often unverifiable nature of astrological predictions, vague nature of the so-called astral influences, etc.

I'm dyslexic, so sometimes add/flip words, or spell chequers do their thing.  But I'll try again.

Austerity, some people understand the word to mean a reduction in spending.  However, spending has to be increased inline with inflation to be the same in 'real' terms.  If you simply keep spending flat, whilst inflation is happening, you are reducing spending in 'real' terms.  You don't have to actually reduce spending in anything but 'real' terms, to have austerity.

&gt;So you're saying it could have been worse if he'd cut more?

Yes, but by worse it will be subjective.  Cutting pensions, cutting child benefits, tax credits, would have zero effect on me personally, because I'm a thirty year old single male, but for other people in my family it would have obviously made things difficult.

&gt; Is there evidence that he wanted to cut more and was reined in by someone? 

No, it's more that there are certainly elements who wish for it to be more austerity, as to how this view is held by our chancellor, I've no idea.

&gt; How do you answer the claim, made by almost every financial expert and institute

This is demonstrably false view.  Just look at what is going on with Greece, there are plenty of 'financial experts' who are pushing them on austerity.

You know the old joke by Churchill?  Put two economists in a room and you will have two differing opinions, three if one of them is Keynes.  You will always find a well respected economist, at a top institute on each side of this debate.

Myself I'd always thought I was a Keynesian for the last 15 years at least, I would still identify as one, but my personal view is that debt should be used for investment that will generate a return, using it to try and prime the economy is risky, using it to pay for pensions is down right wrong, why make a future generation pay with interest, for something that was of no net benefit to them.  So in answer to your last question, I don't think he did badly, mostly because I don't think he did much, doing anything drastic would have had big risk to say the least, by having a pragmatic, conservative (small c) view on the economy, I think we've done fairly well.",null,0,null,1425035572,null,0,false,0,coytv0k,null,t3_2xc5f6,null,t1_coytv0k,null,t1_coytmhx,null,null,null,1427484191,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

*Some* communities are segregated, sure. But I think that's as much the fault of the Brits as the immigrants. My position is that if we were a little more sympathetic then it would be easier for immigrants to adjust. Living in Sweden I see both sides. To some extent the Swedes do things far better than the UK, at least in *some* areas of immigration and multiculturalism. But equally there are some pretty hefty flaws with the system too. Although I have tried to adjust and integrate, even though my Swedish is actually not too bad and I try to join in with their fika etc. I do still feel excluded.

People are welcome to debate the issue, but where I think UKIP really fails is that there is no acknowledgement of the lack of understanding that the UK has generally. UKIP is very much rooted in tradition and conservatism and I honestly believe that their attitude, policies and overall thinking is suited more for 1955 than 2015.

Can didn't shine without the protection in front of him but he should definitely stay there as Lovren works back into the team.

The problem with this strategy is that when times are good the opposition while this is happening can say we should cut taxes, spend on schools, hospitals, etc, or increase the wages of public sector workers while denouncing the running of surpluses as being ideological. There is a significant political cost associated with doing this, whereas spending lots of money is popular.

The result being what Labour did, which was pretend recessions have gone away entirely and spend and borrow enough during the good times to make all of the good, effective investments that we could want.

[Towards the 2008 SNA - Timeline of Events](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/nationalaccount/timeline.asp)

So here's the real deal: The UK Government Cameron/Osborne are being disingenous in their presentation of their response. I suspect they knew the rise would be very high due to the change in accounting standards applied by September as the UN -&gt; EU -&gt; Nation member states adoption took effect.

And here's why:-

Because different members attempt to cast the EU in a light of their choosing.

* Greeks and Italians insist they don't have to pay money due

null,false,Eljero,null,null,null,"Well, I disagree, but I won't downvote just based on that and I'll actually tell you why. 

Firstly, I don't think it was Rodgers' tactics tonight that was the problem; at all in fact. This is a similar enough formation to the one we've been in the whole time we've had this great run. I think the fault here lays with the players.

Starting with Sturridge and Sterling, I think most would easily agree that on average they are our two most dangerous players and while they are different their pace, individual skill levels and sheer determination have led to a lot of goals over the last few years. Tonight I thought both were off. Sturridge seems maybe lacking in confidence, isn't making as many runs as he normally does, is taking quite a few touches nearly each time he gets possession and is ending up wasteful. Sterling, is the more curious one to me because I couldn't quite put my finger on it but I thought he struggled to find space and when he did link up to great effectiveness, especially thought he should have played better off of Balo's great hold up play. That's not to say they didn't show anything at all but both had poor games in my opinion. Next onto the midfield with Can and Allen. People seem to be praising Allen for his performance or making excuses about being overrun in midfield but I thought he was quite average tonight. His defensive work was good, he harried and worked hard and no complaints there. However I thought it was his support of our possession and attacks that was lackluster, I don't think he was looking for the ball enough when we were pressed back and we really needed that because it wasn't coming off for Can tonight. 

Onto him, as you said I thought that he was asked to do a tough role tonight; be Henderson.  This is also the reason I think Allen wasn't looking for the ball as much as he should, because Rodgers asked Can to come short for the ball when we gain back possession, and charge up the field after safely recycling. This I think was a fine tactical decision but as many have noted he seemed to just get tired very quickly and then the rest of his game fell off as well, for the last time I promise, this is where I thought Allen should have recognized that and tried to step into that role with him. 

Ibe and Moreno I thought were a little mistake prone but worked decently hard, in the first half when Besiktas wasn't playing very well we looked fine but as the game got more nervy so did they. To their credit both never stopped their effort (until Ibe was subbed of course) but seemed to be forcing it a bit too much.

In terms of our three center backs, I thought they did well in the first half and in the second were just so harried by the press and forced into distribution mistakes, ending up with them doing a good deal more defending then they should have been required to do.

Finally Balotelli and the link in to why I think our formation and tactics were fine, the players just didn't perform. Overall I think he and Migs are very close in my mind to who showed up the best tonight. His work rate was quite high, as it has been of late, his hold up play was excellent, and I don't need the stats in front of me to note how many fouls he drew throughout the course of the game (although I did think he was embellishing some a bit.) Also he fashioned a great chance for Sturridge, who I think 8 times out of 10 scores that and we win the tie. Lastly, and why I think the tactic was fine, was his defensive work ethic. I thought he was great in that area, he pressed and made life hard for them, he tracked back both into the center and his side of the bitch, and put in a harder shift then anyone maybe barring skrtel (dude always plays hard.) 

That simple reason is why I think the tactics should have been fine, Balo worked so hard for the team, he covered enough, he was an outlet a ton of times, he put in more defensive effort than sterling and sturridge (and in my mind, Lallana) combined. When we lost possession in the first half, Besiktas looked pretty blunt and we fairly easily dealt with it, even with the tiring Can in midfield, but as the game got later everyone seemed to tire and stop helping to beat the press. Let's face it, Besiktas while they wanted it bad that half, are far from the best pressing team we've played or will play this season. We just couldn't cope with it, but our formation should have allowed for that easily. With that set-up when we regain possession it should become a 3-5-2, with our wing backs able to combine with the central players and make darting overlapping runs and diagonals to suck the defense out of position while opening up our creative 3 up top. This just didn't happen though, there would be several sideways passes with no one slipping in the space and then a forced ball either long that missed or back to the keeper and long or into a seemingly overrun midfield because no one was stepping into the space. We were much too stagnant in possession today and that was the killer I think, we lacked that overall energy. I also don't agree that our fullbacks were asked to do to much, it's a lot yes and it's brutal but that's what we've been asking in this system. I don't know if Ibe was a bit tired tonight or if Moreno was just off it tactically but that and the poor performance of Can, combined with Sturridge and Sterling being a bit blunt were the biggest reasons. 

This actually just made me appreciate Henderson even more, we all know his insane work rate and stamina but I think if he is in where Can was (don't know who you take out for him, maybe Lovren and put Can back there?) we would have had a much easier go of it tonight. Hendo's running is so crucial to our style. Perhaps as you said Can was given an near impossible task, not many players can do it, Henderson can.

Lastly I think Rodgers did make an error in taking off Balo when as you could guess I'm sure. I think Sturridge or Sterling for me would have been much better. Lallana was fine when he came on, made mostly good positive passes, was working hard both ways, and making runs off of the strikers.

In making this statement, he is not calmly acknowledging the fact that everyone is prejudiced against other people (whether subconsciously or consciously and whether we like it or not); he is implicitly laying blame at the feet of 'certain groups' because of 'negative experiences' he has had. This is racist. That he is willing to argue a racist viewpoint is wrong, whether he does so calmly or not.

Your argument, then, seems to be: Joe was racist, people called him racist then he got annoyed and revealed what a huge racist he was. This does not lead me to feel a great deal of sympathy for him.

I didn't see the game last night so my opinion will be based on every game he's played since Robles got dropped minus that one. 2. I believe that the WHOLE TEAM is underperforming massively, but I'm only talking about Howard here.

Why are we continually making excuses for a player who's 35? That's what I want to know. Howard's performances recently have been subpar. He has not been himself this season and it's a clear sign that he's on his way down. He has NEVER been a top goalkeeper anyway. Maybe top ten, but not worthy of being placed among the greats.

Robles was starting to string together some good performances and we were actually keeping clean sheets. You mention here that Howard had good games against Chelsea and Young Boys. While you can argue that he made some good saves in those games, you cannot deny that he has made some absolute howlers as well. Look at the first goal at Young Boys away. He almost dives AFTER the ball goes past him. He gets beaten at the near post against Chelsea. Not purely his fault but he can definitely do much, much better in both of those instances. Then there's the two goals at Leicester.

My point is, why are we trying ardently to defend a goalkeeper who's in the twilight period of his career, and who's making mistakes regularly, when we have someone in his early twenties who has nearly a full career ahead of him and who was starting to gain confidence? Howard has cost us points on his own this season.

I like Howard but I don't even see why this is even an argument, and I'm sorry if this offends the Americans, but I DO believe there's bias there. Just my opinion.

I've heard suuupper mixed reviews about that entire product line. It's important to know that collagen is too big to pass through the skin, so collagen really does nothing in topically applied creams. That's not to say this product is bad or won't be moisturising.

If you're interested in trying it out and can be patient,order some samples (this is a reputable seller) from Korea and test them out.

What I do what to say though is two quotes that I kinda subscribe to that seem a bit contradictory.

Firstly.

""I may disagree with what you say but I'll defend to the death you're right to say it"" - Voltaire.  

We all know this one, I even have it tattooed on my back.  However, I also think this is true 

""Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them"" - Karl Popper.

They has to be a line as to what is acceptable because ultimately, dehumanising language can descend from throw away comments to much worse. i.e. the Chelsea lot on the train. Most find their actions unacceptable. Would it have been better had they just chanted and not blocked his access? Should they not have faced consequences because ""free speech""? Their langauge went from spoken racism to actively preventing someone from doing something because of the colour of their skin.  This will always happen if you allow certain things.

So we need to strike a balance between the two, and also remember that ideologically freedom of speech means anyone can say anything. This doesn't mean they have a right to be heard, or given the platform to do so.  It just means that (within reason I believe) the Government can't stop you from saying anything.  Though obviously there have to be caveats as it can contradict other peoples rights as humans so we have to strike a balance.  It must protect us from the Government but also from each other.  i.e. I will defend someones right to speak, but not necessarily tolerate what is being spoken. They can face social consequences for ridiculous and hurtful assertions, as long as the Government doesn't get too heavy handed with the way they intervene and to be honest, as long as they don't start going after political activists that disagree with them and stick to racists that are actually aiming their words of attack at someone in a malicious intent to dehumanise them (and the like) I have no problem with that.

Now, from what you have said about this joethepro36, if it's true that people haven't afforded him a challenging response and just been plain rude, then frankly, I find that a shame.  However, I also stand by the mods for any actions they deem necessary.  As I said, everyone has the right to speak, but you don't have the right to be heard necessarily ... the comments could have and should have challenged him properly and thoughtfully and politely, but also the mods have a right to restrict certain things so the sub remains how they intended and how they want it to run.  Arguably, the white genocide thing could be seen as a conspiracy and fall outside of genuine British Politics worth discussing.  Or it could just be that they want to keep the sub free of anything that is to the extreme, hateful and hurtful so the balance and worth while content is posted that can spark healthy discussion without descending into calling each other cunts for our views

Sir Jeremy Heywood is the current Cabinet secretary, and arguably one of the most powerful men in England. Would you say he's ""upper class""?

If not then it sort of proves my point, power correlates with class but doesn't define it. John PRescott was once Deputy Prime Minister, was he upper class?

If you do consider the Cabinet Secretary to be upper class simply because he's in government, then by definition Robert Fitzwalter wasn't the ""upper class"" of the time as he wasn't ruling the country.

So no I don't not have a book on my shelf that says ""At the time of the Baron War this is how you would define the middle class of society"". I have made a statement based on the generally accepted definitions of what a middle class is (i.e. not the ruling class but above the working class).

If you want to dispute my definition of a middle class being not the ruling class but not the working class I'm happy to provide definitions agreeing with that.

If you wish to disagree that Robert Fitzwalter was not part of the ruling class, I can provide evidence showing that he was not involved in ruling the kingdom (but hopefully you know this because you're aware of the fact he needed to rebel to enforce change).

If you agree to both those above points but still disagree, then that's a matter of opinion. My original point was it's always the better educated classes that aren't ruling that organised successful revolutions against established orders. You point was there were ""upper class revolutions"" but the entire point of the Baron Wars was a class of noble forcing the ruling class of noble (the monarch) to provide them with certain rights.

I've not only already pointed out that, in my opinion, I don't count them as successful as they didn't even achieve their most basic aims (the magna carta being largely ignored by many kings). I also pointed out that, in my opinion, the first war did not count as a revolution as they were address specific grievances not trying to end the established order.

Even if we ignore these points though, the point still remains that in the society at the time, there was a ruling class, a class below that, and a class at the bottom. You had the monarch, you had lesser nobles, and then you had everyone else. The class in the middle (AKA what I am referring to as the middle class) at the time were land owners, due to the way society was organised.

If you want to disagree with that you can do, but that's a matter of interpretation and opinion. You will equally not be able to link me something definitively saying there was only two classes in society at the time of the Barons Wars. The actual evidence is the same and you're not actually disputing, what you're disputing is how I interpret it, which is fine, but that's not because I lack evidence, it's because I view it differently.",null,0,null,1425038289,null,0,false,0,coyufop,null,t3_2x7zxc,null,t1_coyufop,null,t1_coyhv0h,null,null,null,1427484458,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

So if he did, for some reason, decide to kick you out for not paying the rent, you'd have plenty of chances to get things straightened out, possibly with the help of the courts.

It is not an overwhelming majority. That is biased reporting by a publicly funded news org (funded in the hope that it is non-biased).

&gt; You could also have linked to the many media outlets who instead chose to focus on the 24% figure. It's hardly been hushed up. There are two sides to this coin; on the one hand, or turns out the majority of British Muslims are well integrated and hold values most of us would agree with

Of course I could. So what? We are talking about the source of this thread, the BBC. 

&gt; ""Let me say that again. One in four do not oppose killing as a retribution for a drawing.""
&gt; That's a bit of an extrapolation from the data presented to you from the survey though isn't it? You can't really claim that, and it's that kind of hyperbole that can make things dangerous.

Prove me wrong with the actual wording then. If one group are opposed, then are the others not opposed? Step up, don't insinuate. 

&gt; To be honest, I wouldn't be surprised if similar numbers of British people ""supported acts of violence"" against the arseholes who burn poppies on remembrance Sunday. The figure is disheartening, yes, but ratcheting up the rhetoric at the risk of demonising a whole demographic group for views they do not hold is a pretty immature response to take.

Really now? You would not be suprised, and that is not much of generalization of an entire demographic? You don't mind defending one group, but you would not be 'surprised' about the other. I don't think its possible to be much more biased then that. Two faced in fact.

Two very striking examples of this are the historiography of the Paris Commune and the Spanish Civil War, and even the Russian Revolution, and you can go all the way back to the Peasant's Revolt or even, like I said, Spartacus, and see the same phenomenon.

While he still has a shit tonne of work to do to be considered as reaching his potential I think he finally seems motivated to be the player everyone thinks he can be.

I do wonder though if the dressing room is entirely happy with him being there.  The penalty incident recently and seeing him called out by Stevie and watching Sturridge's reaction might demonstrate that there's something going on.

Essentially once the protectionism was taken away the local tea importers and smugglers couldn't compete with the East India Company so were pissed off and wanted the law changed back - using nationalistic arguments about taxation and representation was a clever way to get the public on board rather than arguing from blatant self-interest (which would harm the American consumer who had to pay more for their Tea)

It is. 

&gt;Of course I could. So what? We are talking about the source of this thread, the BBC.

I was under the impression we were talking about public attitudes generally. Fair enough if that's not so, I guess. 

&gt;Prove me wrong with the actual wording then. If one group are opposed, then are the others not opposed? Step up, don't insinuate.

From the BBC article:

&gt;Asked if acts of violence against those who publish images of the Prophet Muhammad can ""never be justified"", 68% agreed that such violence was never justifiable.

&gt;But 24% disagreed with the statement, while the rest replied ""don't know"" or refused to answer.

Acts of violence =/= support for killings in the street. I'm not defending it, but equating that statement with advocacy of murder is worse than just cherry-picking statistics; it's an extrapolation without basis.

&gt;Really now? You would not be suprised, and that is not much of generalization of an entire demographic? You don't mind defending one group, but you would not be 'surprised' about the other.

I'm not defending anyone. I'm saying people are dicks whatever their demographic. There's a lot of uproar and hyperbole because these people are Muslims and I think this is unhelpful. Case in point, you (amongst many others) are wanting to make a big fuss about the 24% who are at odds with our society, yet I rarely see the same outrage at the rise of far right groups such as Britain First or the EDL. All I'm saying is that we should be careful and not misrepresent facts, or put emotive spins on news stories like this, otherwise we just end up stirring the cauldron.

&gt;I am done FezojT. You don't have anything beyond generalizations and 'I thinks' statements. Good day to you.

Well I'm sorry you feel like that. Have a nice day.

That's today, after an elongated recession and its aftermath. My hypothetical is based on a faster recovery.

Noticed the automated machines? Staffing levels are going one way

&gt;And I have no clue why you're bringing up tax avoidance. That is a separate issue.

If you are looking for recovery you want the cash to change hands as much as possible. Not go gov-&gt; guy-&gt; tesco -&gt; caymans

So it would seem that the most 'efficient' industries should be avoided.

All it does is convince people that sterotypes are true and that people on the left never back up what they say with fact.

It's the same reason the working poor are turned against the unemployed, because the Daily Mail says all unemployed people are like this and attaches a stigma onto it. Your attitude and response makes people think ""Well if I support left wing policies I'm going to be associated with arseholes like that"".

&gt;What I have said is substantially true; working class movements do have a history of being hijacked by middle-class people who proceed to make them fit their own agendas, and then bourgeois historians write biased accounts confirming their own prejudices, the centrality of the leader-principle, the idea that everything good comes from the middle classes, and so on.

So do you actually have any evidence that shows that these revolutions would have been successful without middle class involvement? Or is it just a conspiracy theory without any proof to back it up?

I'm happy to read anything you've got that explains this with examples, but simply saying ""Well they all would have been successful even without the middle class, they just hijacked it"" doesn't actually prove anything.

There is a pattern across the world which shows when the middle class united with the working class you got successful revolutions (Russia, France, America) when the middle class sided with the upper class there was no revolution (Britain, Japan).

If you're suggesting that the above pattern is a coincidence, and actually in those examples the middle class was irrelevant, but they managed to hijack the revolutions and re-write history, then I would love to read something actually explaining the point properly, not just listen to you insisting it's true without backing it up.

""no... not at all. America for example... if you have sources/experts supporting your opinion then do share as the preponderance of any google search is on my side.""

I don't really understand what you're trying to point out here either, but as you brought up America: That is a country with huge social issues *and certainly not one we should aim to emulate in all aspects*, but one thing is certain... The yanks are on a totally different level to the rest of the world in terms of growth since WW2, and GDP per capita, even including countries like Norway with vast oil wealth. The country is also governed in a WAY more right wing manner than any other advanced economy. In fact you look at the economic growth of all advanced economies over the last 50 years or so, the more right wing the government, the better economic growth is. Hence why the majority of Economists are at least moderately right wing in regards to regulation and fiscal spending.

My original point was that the markets have already proven the theory that we could have spent our way out of the crisis wrong. You can see this by looking at borrowing costs over the last 5 years. They have been as low (or recently lower) than they have ever been before, and lower than almost any other country in the world.

The stuff that stops things getting built, like the aforementioned tunnels or homes or schools.

In addition it is a publicly known and acknowledged fact that Hamas specifically, deliberate and wilfully uses civilians as human shields. See the school that was used as a storage of Qassam rockets, any incidental civilian deaths while admittedly tragic are definitively within the legal definitions of proportionality for jus in bellum. Israel tries to warn civilians within the immediate vicinity of a strike and then bam.

Something that many people do not understand is that in this case a doctrine of proportionality is a legal term of art, most people think of it terms of slicing cakes or ""I get one, he gets one and you get one and we go on and that is fair and proportional."" etc etc. No.

In conflict a doctrine of proportionality is...

&gt;Proportionality in international law is not about equality of death or civilian suffering, or even about [equality of] firepower. Proportionality weighs the necessity of a military action against suffering that the action might cause to enemy civilians in the vicinity.

Furthermore a definition of proportionality is

&gt;Under international humanitarian law and the Rome Statute, the death of civilians during an armed conflict, no matter how grave and regrettable, does not in itself constitute a war crime. International humanitarian law and the Rome Statute permit belligerents to carry out proportionate attacks against military objectives, even when it is known that some civilian deaths or injuries will occur. A crime occurs if there is an intentional attack directed against civilians (principle of distinction) (Article 8(2)(b)(i)) or an attack is launched on a military objective in the knowledge that the incidental civilian injuries would be clearly excessive in relation to the anticipated military advantage (principle of proportionality) (Article 8(2)(b)(iv)).
Article 8(2)(b)(iv) criminalizes:
**Intentionally launching an attack in the knowledge that such attack will cause incidental loss of life or injury to civilians or damage to civilian objects or widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment which would be clearly excessive in relation to the concrete and direct overall military advantage anticipated;**
Article 8(2)(b)(iv) draws on the principles in Article 51(5)(b) of the 1977 Additional Protocol I to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, but restricts the criminal prohibition to cases that are ""clearly"" excessive. The application of Article 8(2)(b)(iv) requires, inter alia, an assessment of:
**(a) the anticipated civilian damage or injury;
(b) the anticipated military advantage;
(c) and whether (a) was ""clearly excessive"" in relation to (b).**

I would argue that the numerous times Israeli forces have called off attacks when seeing Palestinian Militants use human shields or when they warn civilians to leave an area because it has been deemed to no longer be a civilian facility any more but has become a valid military target that they are displaying, to a degree, a level of restraint and adherence to the doctrine of proportionality.

Then we have this gem of a line...

&gt;""The Israelis kept saying rockets were fired from schools or hospitals when in fact they were fired 200 or 300 metres  away. Still, there were some mistakes made and they were quickly dealt with,"" Hamad told The Associated Press, offering the first acknowledgment by a Hamas official that, in some cases, militants fired rockets from or near residential areas or civilian facilities.

http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/hamas-admits-rockets-were-fired-at-israel-from-gaza-neighbourhoods-1.2764125

The problem is this ok? http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/6-30/f630_5.htm#REF32h4

&gt;b. Danger Close. DANGER CLOSE is included in the method of engagement when the target is (rounds will impact) within 600 meters of friendly troops for mortar and artillery, 750 meters for naval guns 5-inch and smaller, and 1,000 meters for naval guns larger than 5-inch. For naval 16-inch ICM, danger close is 2,000 meters.

You think Hamas doesn't know this? Even with precision guided munitions which the Israeli uses and not carpet bombing ok, modern military explosives are so freaking powerful and the standards of construction in Gaza are so shit, that ONE bomb even one of the smallest ones that could be fielded as a stand off weapon, will leave the area looking like in the video afterwards pretty fucking easily. In addition there is something called CEP circular error probable where with modern precision guided munitions can get down to about 3 meters.

http://i.imgur.com/bCUlzar.jpg

See this chart? Well yeah it leads that even with the smallest bomb around we're looking at a casualty range of about 60 meters, add on that Hamas will store and launch weapons in and around civilians and if I blow up those bombs with a bomb then those bombs will also go off increasing the blast radius.

A ""decent force"" of soldiers going in? Look that's what they try to do and then you've got pissed off 19 year olds who are armed with guns and grenades and fire support having rocks thrown at them constantly by kids and having pot shots taken at them by militants, shades of Bloody Sunday coming to mind here (Small incidents like this have already happened and oh god it's an even worse PR incident then bombing a building). It's safer for the Israelis (both in terms of to their soldiers and in public relations) to just bomb the sites. In addition we could end up with Israeli soldiers being captured a la Lebanon. 

I hope I've managed to show you how Israel can and consistently does argue that their response is proportional in the international conflict/humanitarian law framework and so... Well yeah they can basically tell the rest of the world to chin off... I'm not saying that it's going to win the publics hearts and minds. Completely not.

In any case, ultimately Joe outed himself.

If you reduced spending, then lets assume that you can no longer afford to get the bus due to the need to make savings, and thus you have to take on less work, lowering your over all income

If we swang it round and you spent MORE money per year, but that money was being invested in your education and infastructure (like for example a car) then your job prospects increase and thus your overall earnings increase, once you have got the infastructure and education you can then reduce your spending whilst still earning more thanks to your previous investments.

On the other hand, if it would not have existed without him, then perhaps the stereotype has been built around the idea we now have of him as the preeminent example of the type. Furthermore, despite what you say, he was not perceived by the public to be in any way untoward until some time after his death, a few years, not decades, ago. To satisfy yourself of this, try to find an article about him published before his death that describes him as in any way creepy or sexually deviant, as an exercise. Therefore we are projecting our stereotype based on him back unto him andtautologically. First we ""discover"" he's a paedophile, though there has been no trial. Secondly, now that we believe him to be a paedophile, we imagine paedophiles will in general look like him, though we would never have suspected this before. The word ""paedophile"" only became common currency about 15 years ago. Then we say that he looks like a paedophile because he looks like himself. Then we wonder why we didn't know all along. This explains the absurd notion that he was ""hiding in plain view"". It derives from the retrospective attribution of a stereotype that didn't exist at the time, perhaps.

This is correct... of course these things are important, that doesn't mean astrology is real.

&gt; The mumble mumble astrology is stupid, is an easy up vote on reddit by a smug user base that never really question the limits of their own knowledge.

Definition of knowledge aside / No it's not, I'm perfectly aware that I think I know things that are false - that I don't and can't know 99.9%(probably more) of things that are knowable. Don't assume things about people you've never met.

&gt; When we are conceived, when we are born, where we are now are all strongly influenced by both solar and lunar positions

I have no idea what you're saying here... Are you claiming that where and when we are born defines where and where we are?... Did you also know that black = black? Can you clarify.

&gt; lunar gravity and solar radiation are perhaps the most obvious physical influences on the earth and on us

I can think of others, but sure.

&gt; We know this affects menstruation cycles, when to harvest and anything else involving biological cycles.

Riiiight...Not sure how that's relevant.. but okay

&gt; Astrology has evolved over millennia of careful scientific study by all ancient civilisations and used for practical decision making from when to plant to when to wage wars.

This claim speaks of a misunderstanding of both the history of astrology and what scientific study is. Astrology has not demonstrated its effectiveness in controlled studies and has no scientific validity - feel free to [read up](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=8313026&amp;fileId=S1743921311002602) [on this.](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886905004046) Astrology itself is what is known as a [Pseudoscience](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoscience) as those that make the false claims about it are not using the [scientific method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method).

&gt; Be as dismissive as you like but if you think that the sum total of astrology is Mystic Meg in the Sun then that's your ignorance.

And happily so, I am willing to accept that I am ignorant about many many things... And there is nothing wrong with that... I'm happy and willing and eager to learn.. but I won't accept astrology is real without extraordinary evidence convincing me it isn't anything more than either a scam or a bunch of mental idiots claiming they can see the future in tea-leaves, in short something to counter the above.

-------------

Any kind of direct action or unofficial protest? No, we mustn't, because ""the Daily Mail won't like it"" ""it will alienate the middle classes"". 

I've got news for you. The Daily Mail isn't going to like anything that comes from the left, from the most moderate liberal to the most extreme anarchist. When the Daily Mail doesn't like something that you do or say, that is a good sign, not a bad sign. 

As for the other thing, I've already given you examples; the Paris Commune, the Spanish Civil War. You can also apply it to the Russia Revolution, which was hijacked by Bolsheviks, Lenin and so on, who then twisted it to meet their own needs. It can be applied to almost any popular revolt since Spartacus. These self-appointed leaders always end up doing more harm than good. 

The fact that your sources on these revolutions have told you that it was all due to nice middle-class leaders who came along and made everything better, already makes my point. The fact that sources that are sympathetic to popular revolutions are hard to find also makes my point. 

Kropotkin says ""...if all of us have contributed to some extent to the work of liberation of exploited mankind, it is because our ideas have been more or less the expression of the ideas that are germinating in the very depths of the masses of the people. The more I live, the more I am convinced that no truthful and useful social science, and no useful and truthful social action, is possible but the science which bases its conclusions, and the action which bases its acts, upon the thoughts and inspirations of the masses. All sociological science and all social actions which do not do that must remain sterile"". 

Meltzer/Christie say ""The fashionable philosophers of today, whose academic pedantry and class prejudices do not permit them to take note of anybody not mentioned in the university curriculum, will deny that such ideas germinate in the masses and will credit the motivation for social progress to classes of society more congential to themselves"".

That is a crap statement as it isn't accompanied by the necesasry caveats. If the economy is below its potential GDP then stimulus is desirable, while if an economy is above its potential GDP then stimulus is unhelpful.

Since the crash the economy has been consistently under potential GDP (evidenced by unemployment), so stimulus would be rather effective (high multiplier). There wouldn't be much inflation while the economy was under potential (it would mean however there would be less unemployment).

The time for austerity was *before* the crash when we had low unemployment and the economy was doing well (no need for excess public spending to compete with the private sector for limited numbers of employees).

We adopted it in '63 when Gerry and the Pacemakers (a Liverpool band) covered it.  To me, the fans on the terraces represent that little voice and the resolve inside the players that can keep them fighting through adversity.  We obviously can't get on the pitch and kick the ball and that song just shows that there are 40000 people willing them on.  There's something about the song when sung from everyone in Anfield.

I mean.... If we're saying there's only a certain amount of money for the government to spend.... Kinda? 

I don't know how much money your mum and others like her need, but we all know that other people are losing money they *desperately* need, just so the government can keep up with their triple lock pension (which I believe is a lib dem policy). 

I'd love to double your mums pension, but not if it means (for example) getting rid of all JSA and child benefit. Would I personally cut the pension to increase JSA or child benefits? I don't think so, but if I'm cutting everything, as the coalition are, its only fair I cut pensions too. 

&gt; But suggesting that the group in receipt of more benefits should be brought down to the level of the other is immoral.

The phenomenon of older house owners sitting on equity is a function of the fact that during the period from the 1950s to the late 1970s the middle classes expanded in this country and in the 1980's a lot of public housing stock was sold off to people that could afford to buy it.

The middle class is contracting again and housing is relatively scarce in some areas which is why there is a perceived gap between young and old.

What is true is that many opportunities that existed back in the last third of the last century no longer exist, and that isn't the fault of most pensioners at all.",null,0,null,1425045050,null,0,false,0,coywf98,null,t3_2xcgtz,null,t1_coywf98,null,t1_coyw93r,null,null,null,1427485451,null,33,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,33,null

Uh, no it doesn't. Menstruation cycles are different in humans than other animals - many of which only menstruate once per year or when certain other scenarios are fulfilled, like the presence of male hormones. For humans, menstruation is not uniform. For some women it's considerably longer than 28 days, for some it's considerably shorter, for some it's eratic and doesn't happen the same every month. For some there's no menstruation at all, and for others their menstruation is whenever is most convenient for them because they've managed it through pills.

If lunar cycles did effect human menstruation, then all women would menstruate at the same time of month, but that's not the case either, it's spread out all over the month. The close proximity of another woman, such as a housemate or sister, has greater effect on changing when in a month a woman has her period than the moon does.

The approximate frequency of menstruation cycles being similar to lunar cycles is coincidence, linked together as a result by ancient civilisations who didn't know real science.",null,0,null,1425045103,null,0,false,0,coywg0f,null,t3_2x9h69,null,t1_coywg0f,null,t1_coyuvaj,null,null,null,1427485461,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

It was also partly due to the bailout of the financial sector. This was debt taken on to service that bailout, it wasn't a regular cost. The resulting interest payments obviously would result in increased government spending the following year (assuming other spending was as before), but the loans taken out to fund it were a one-off.

Essentially, the thing that shot the deficit up to those ~£150bn levels was the recession, so arguably boosting the economy is/was the best way to decrease it.

There was this assumption that huge amounts of government spending was wasteful and spurious.. it seems to have turned out that the majority of it wasn't.

How much of an effect on the economic recovery the cuts made in the first few years are difficult to quantify (external factors obviously play a part), but it seems that once Osbourne backtracked a bit on austerity then the economy started to improve.

Note that before the Tory government and their policy of austerity, there had been a bit of a recovery under the Labour government who had begun to spend their way out of the recession. Personally, I think the austerity cuts went too far and damaged the recovery, but who's to say what would've happened under Labour's plan (there were still going to be cuts, but no where near as harsh).",null,0,null,1425045242,null,0,false,0,coywhv6,null,t3_2xc5f6,null,t1_coywhv6,null,t1_coyviae,null,null,null,1427485485,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

Ageing is different. Ageing happens to everyone. it's not unreasonable to expect everyone to plan for their old age because it happens to almost everyone. Yet, we give huge benefits to elderly people regardless. Now, of course disabled elderly should receive support but the current state of things is that once you reach a certain age, regardless of health, you get huge amounts of support from the government.

&gt; Well, no, it's made possible by all broadcasters. I'm sure ITV/Sky/BT keep lots of outside broadcast contractors in business through their football and sports coverage, for example.

The BBC dwarfs the others in terms of scale and reach, and has a public service remit not covered by the others (for the most part). 

&gt; It simply isn't. When my taxes pay for a new road, better railway line, hospital or school that's near me, that delivers far more of a benefit to the local economy than helping to pay for yet another BBC employee in Salford or Cardiff. I'd much rather pay towards stuff that benefits me and the people around me. The idea that the BBC is a national must because of the benefits it brings to a few people in a few cities is just total rubbish

I'm sorry this is totally idiotic. Clearly some national infrastructure has to be located in a set number of places e.g. is it a problem that there are no Navy jobs near me? no because the benefit of the navy isn't the jobs it provides - its the defence - the jobs are a secondary benefit. The benefit of the BBC is not jobs at the BBC, its content and services it creates, which is clearly available nationally. 

Saying you don't benefit from the BBC because there are no BBC jobs near you is total, utter,  nonsense.

I'm first of all very much aware of the turmoil caused by defending a racist's right to free speech. Now I've already made myself master of the point that racism is not to be tolerated in our society, and it I will continue to say it until I'm blue in the face.

This is where it all falls down for me, and so far nobody has given me what I think of as an appropriate answer to this: how does exclusion help eradicate racism? You touched on this but it doesn't feel like enough to me.

Armchair psychology alert! In many ways it's counter productive. The excluded individual, already harbouring resentment towards the group that ostracise him, may feel justified in nurturing that resentment. What he already thought was right has been proven to him! Now he *knows* he's right! Perhaps.

For the rest of us, the problem has gone away. No more unpleasant voices or bad thoughts! Except that really all that's happened is the problem has been hidden.

Exclusion does not change matters, it just makes us all feel better and less threatened until Bulldog turns up with an alt-account.

So yeah, I'm an armchair analyst with fuck all to back myself up. I'm stating my opinion. And my opinion is that banning Joe solves nothing. Nor does shouting him down, downvoting him to hell, insulting or belittling him. By excluding or discriminating against someone who feels that way about race it feels like saying ""have a taste of your own medicine,"" and that leaves a very bitter taste in my mouth. It feels to me like hypocrisy, though many will feel otherwise.

I dunno. Sure he broke the rules, but as you point out in your edit above other rules also get broken from time to time, sometimes it seems with no repercussions. In an ideal world this sub would be non-judgemental towards the contributors but sometimes I break my lethargic spells and feel compelled to express my disappointment.

Maybe I should have stayed out of this from the word go. Part of me regrets ever wading in, but I think I'd regret leaving a (perceived) injustice go unnoticed even more. As I said in someone else's comment thread a few days ago I am prejudiced towards Rupert Murdoch. I can't stand the man and his evil empire. But should he turn up on my doorstep with a head injury I think I would still be the sort of person to let him in, sit him down and give him a cup of tea while we wait for the ambulance.

The Wall St. experts who created these financial instruments failed to predict how quickly low-quality mortgages would default to some extent because the national value of housing had gone up for decades. But, as defaults did rise, the value of these derivatives cascaded and the banks and other institutions which held them were required to take massive losses. At Davos, Russian and Chinese leaders attacked the U.S. for the ""failure"" of regulators which allowed the spread of toxic derivatives.

As it was (without additional stimulus) Inflation was 3-4% all the way from 2010 to 2012, and was above 2% until Jan 2014. It wouldn't have taken much to send this too high.

While unemployment did rise during the recession, ultimately we've had relatively low employment throughout the crisis. It peaked at just under 8%, which is less than France (for example) has had for decades!

Ultimately my point is that it is very debatable how much (if any) spare capacity was actually in the economy, but you're stating your argument like it is a fact that there was lots.

Current UK law allows you to carry a non-locking blade with length of 3 inches or less in public, for non-specific day-to-day use.  Think of something like a swiss army knife or similar small penknife with only a slipjoint spring and no other mechanical device to hold the blade open.  

Anything larger or with a fixed or locking blade and you will need to prove ""good reason"" for having it on your person, in a public place.  Oft quoted examples would be a tradesperson who requires said knife for carrying out their job or a chef transporting their knives from work to home.

However, a knife of any size, locking or not, can be considered an offensive weapon by the police if they decide that you have intent to use it as such.  Therefore, telling any policeman that you have a knife, of any type, on you for ""self defence"" is not a good idea and will very likely land you in deep shit.

The knife that you're talking about has a locking blade and is, by design, clearly a weapon and has little use as a utility tool.  For that reason, I can't ever see you convincing a policeman (or judge) that you have ""good reason"" to be carrying it in a public place.  

On top of that, attempting to use a knife for self-defence without proper training (and no, YouTube videos don't count) is most likely end up with you being injured by that very same knife; either though your own lack of skill or by having it taken off you and used against you instead.  You said you were attacked by three guys; when you stick the knife in the first guy, what do you think the other two are going to do?  Most likely kick the fuck out of you, perhaps even beat you to death (they might even get away with it, if they spin it as self-defence against someone armed with a knife).

The best course of action is to try and avoid a confrontation, like the one you describe, in the first place.  If you can't do that, then do all you can to defuse the situation or flat out just run away.  One of my friends is a 6'4"" paratrooper from Northern Ireland; he is one of the hardest guys that I have ever met - even he says that his first action in any confrontation is to try and defuse the situation before it can come to blows, because once a fight starts, even with formal training, the outcome is never certain.",null,0,null,1425047227,null,0,false,0,coyxang,null,t3_2xad6n,null,t1_coyxang,null,t3_2xad6n,null,null,null,1427485857,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

null,false,Zanza_N,,UKIP | It's all about Nuttall,null,"Right, so I'm gonna give a bit of a more public response to this issue on behalf of the mods.

I'll start this off by saying we have had problems with this sub...lots of problems even. It's certainly taken time for this place to become even mildly accepting of UKIP and the right, but it's still not good enough.

What I've tried to help to do since I've become moderator is to make this place a lot more friendly to those on the right of the political spectrum, unfortunately that's not been the easiest of tasks for various reasons and it has actually got worse when we got an influx of subscribers recently.

We don't want people to be downvoted simply for their opinion, downvotes are for those who aren't contributing to the discussion, to those who are breaking rules. Somebody like Joe who is getting mass downvoted and shouted down simply for his political views is out of order.

We all wish there was an easy solution to stop those who downvote based on opinion...but there isn't. We are currently looking at what the options are for it but the only options we have on that is to remove the downvote button or make a popup telling people not to downvote just because they don't agree. The ideal solution however would just be to attract more people from the right of the political spectrum...which is an incredibly difficult task. If you or absolutely anybody has a good suggestion for this, let us know via modmail or PM.

Now...for the issue of free speech. As much as I may personally believe in free speech, each establishment has its own set of rules for what is allowed and what isn't, as a subreddit the rules we have in the sidebar are rules which we expect people to follow, if people break those rules once or twice, we'll give them a warning and let them know that continuing can cause them to receive a punishment.

In the case of Joethepro, he broke the rules of the subreddit a few times and was cut slack on that, as it got more problematic I took it upon myself to send him a personal private message which didn't contain any threats of any kind, just polite advice. Joethepro assumed I was threatening him and got particularly defensive on the subject. He continued to post in this manner despite being told to stop. He was given a further warning by both Locutus and Optio in public this time, which was to be interpreted as a final warning, he was told not to continue on that subject but yet it turns out he had continued to break the rules we had set out.

At that point, further warnings wouldn't mean anything to him, we can't let people continue breaking rules for us only to repeatedly warn them, eventually we must act and give them a punishment as otherwise...our warnings mean nothing.

Free speech unfortunately doesn't apply in this subreddit, we want people to be able to discuss topics but they must follow our rules, the racism rule means that despite however civil you may be in wording the post, if you are to say something which is racist, that is offensive and hurtful to some people and I think most people agree that racism is a very bad thing.

So my main point with this post is to say that we have failed as a subreddit in preventing people from being nasty towards Joe and other right-wingers, we are working hard to stop anybody who breaks our rules despite where they are in our political spectrum but sometimes we miss posts, I encourage anybody and everybody who sees a post breaking our rules to report it and we'll have a look at it. We do have rules which must be followed by everybody, if those rules are repeatedly broken and warnings are not heeded, a punishment will be inevitable.

&gt; Why not join a union, a political party, a co-operative and take part in direct action? Why is it one and not the other?

Well the first thing I'd say is that (probably) the majority of anarchists *are* union members. I'm a member of Unison myself. Speaking broadly, general view amongst anarchist communists (the tendency the AF belongs to) tends to be that although the trade unions are inherently limited by their role as intermediaries between labour and capital, it can still be useful to be a union member, both as a point of contact with other workers in organising at work (which is a major part of what we do as class struggle anarchists) and as a means of keeping some basic level of protection at work (e.g. representation in the event of formal disciplinary stuff). Basically we want to organise at work, and since at the moment the trade unions are where that's mostly happening, we are members of those unions where we think it will be useful. It is worth bearing in mind that anarchism has its historical roots in the labour movement.

Similarly, a significant minority of anarchists are members of workers' co-ops. The AF doesn't have any particular position on this as an organisation but speaking in a personal capacity, while I wouldn't see it as a particularly useful political strategy, there's nothing wrong co-ops as a way of making a living (at least, nothing that isn't already an issue with other employers).

Political parties, on the other hand, are a whole other matter. Since we see the state as not only structurally incapable of giving us what we want, but set up to oppose us whoever may happen to be in charge of it at the time. Often leaders of leftist political parties will make big promises about structural change, and I'm inclined to say that they are *usually* sincere in what they are saying, but history and current events shows us that they will generally fail to actually deliver on these promises. We see this with Syriza in Greece, they stood on a platform of no further austerity and sweeping reform of Greece's debt, but the international financial institutions are simply not going to allow that to happen. The Troika will see Greece's economy crash and burn before they'll let them opt out of the neo-liberal project.

&gt; one thing I can never understand is why they insist on only direct action...Why is it one and not the other?

Well this is partly to do with the very specific way we think about direct action. When we talk about [direct action](http://afed.org.uk/ace/aspects.html#Part12), we mean ""taking control of our own lives and action to create a better world without the mediation of political parties and other organisations that would act on our behalf"". Direct action can mean organising a strike for better terms and conditions at work, email and phone campaigns against a dodgy landlord to get a stolen deposit on a flat back or organising a boycott in support of a strike; in other words action organised by ourselves and on our own behalf, rather than seeking to act through representatives.

This is largely because of what we see as the limited nature of representative politics. Representatives, be they union officials, professional community organisers or MPs, must be able to exert control over the community they seek to represent in order to negotiate, which is to say that they need to be able to guarantee to the boss or the state that when they say ""stop,"" we will stop. We think that this inevitably leads to dodgy compromises and ""sell out"" (not a term I really like but close enough) deals. We see this in, for instance, Ed Milliband making the disastrously daft declaration that it is wrong to strike ""while negotiations are ongoing,"" as if negotiations are a bad time to put pressure on your opponent or local government workers have some kind of moral duty to the state. He's certainly no Marxist ;)

1st Doctor- Between age 200-240 when he leaves Gallifrey with Susan (guessing from the age Susan looks, and the fact that the Doctor said TImelords look teenaged for about 50 years). Regenerates at 450.
 
2nd Doctor- Says he is 450. Travels for about 3-4 years in this incarnation.
 
3rd Doctor- Dies at age 748. Presumably travels around for a while between travelling with Jo and Sarah Jane.
 
4th Doctor- 748 at start. 750 when met Leela. 759 when met Romana. Romana was also a Timelord/lady so they could have travelled for lots of years without obviously aging- this is probably what happened.
 
5th Doctor- 800-900 years. Never actually said his age on screen.
 
6th Doctor- About 900. 953 at time of regeneration.
 
7th Doctor- Aged to 1012 before regenerating (according to the TV Movie).
 
8th Doctor- Some years, including in Time War. In the Big Finish stories, he spent 600 years on Orbis- but I'll not count this.
 
War Doctor- On TV, he is about 900 years old. In *Engines of War*, it says he spent 400 years in the war.
 
9th Doctor- Said he was 900.
 
10th Doctor- Age 906 in *The End of Time*.
 
11th Doctor- His younger self at Utah was 909 and his older self was 1103. Age 1200 in *A Town Called Mercy*. Rounds age down to 1000 when he meets Clara. Depending on what you watch/read, the Doctor spent between 300 and 900 years on Trenzalore.
 
12th Doctor- Claims to be over 2000 after he regenerates.
 
There was a definite change in his age when NuWho started. Most of it is attributed to him forgetting.

So you shoot off at £100bn/year deficit, for two years then a new budget is announced by a politician and he says, to much celebration that the *deficit* is *coming* down. He doesn't say the deficit is zero, he just says it's coming down. You're still hurtling down the road, but rather than £100bn/MPH, you're now going at £65bn/MPH. Each year the deficit decreases (where we are at now with the UK budget), and eventually, the speedo says £0bn. But the celebration isn't due yet. You're £800bn miles away from the start line of Zero National Debt.

If you run a £200bn/year surplus for two years, you're still only half way back. Give it three more years and you're a *negative* distance from the start line (you're in the car park) with not just an annual budget surplus, but a cash-in-hand surplus (like Norway or Saudi Arabia).

But this almost knee-jerk reaction seems to appear almost any time a crime story hits the news, no matter what the sentence is. 

If we look at the comments here relating to the length of the sentence and them being too short, there is nothing specific; the statements could apply just the same to sentences a fifth as long or 5 times as long.

Perhaps this isn't a problem and we should just accept it, but imho it is. This kind of reaction results in politicians calling for tougher/longer sentences, and requiring them, *even if there is no reason for it* (it doesn't even seem to make people feel better having a tougher justice system, as it never seems to be tough enough). And so you get more people in prison, longer sentences, even if there is no public benefit to it (and some public cost, never mind the personal cost).

As [the Sentencing Council notes](http://www.sentencingcouncil.org.uk/about-sentencing/sentencing-myths/#1) on their website, the prison population in the England and Wales nearly doubled between 1993 and 2012, with the average sentence increasing, with the number of indeterminate sentences going up by factor of 4.

I was in the same boat as you, most of my experience was in Project Management (PMP certified) and enterprise level account/sales management. Though i also had experience in vendor management, program management, implementation management and biz analysis. All of it for a eComm/SaaS company. When i was laid off i was Director level but basically serving as an in-house consultant.

So after getting laid off really all i knew was what i *didn't* want to do...which was project management for a software/SaaS/eComm company. Unfortunately that is all anyone was interested in talking to me about....so many conversations with recruiters and head-hunters involved me saying ""I understand it is a highly marketable skill and there is a need for it....but i don't want to do project management.""....none of them could understand why i would say such a thing. I could list off some reasons (i'm sure you could as well) but it really came down to the simplest explanation of ""I am still not sure what i want to do when i grow up."" and i know i can do much more than PM work and have it be more interesting and challenging.

Was just about to bite the bullet this week (5 months unemployed) and accept a PM role when a company came in and has offered me a position (literally waiting for the offer letter to be emailed to me at the moment) in Channel Management. Not sure if it is what i ultimately is what i want to do....but it is something new and it isn't what i was doing before.

Samsungs strategy has been to literally build every conceivable variation of a phone and then spend something like $1billion in advertising, they literally throw money into making sure they build their brand to be the other option to Apple.  Forget that there are a tonne of other Android phones out there, you say Android most tend to think of Samsung because they are literally advertised everywhere as the alternative choice.

And, whilst they may do so well, a lot of Android that use Android for what the software offers (i.e. everything that's different to Apple) will tend to tell you that prefer anything *but* Samsung partly because of all the bloat ware that is shipped on Samsung handsets amongst other things.

Apple tend to do well for three reasons and I don't believe it's anything really to do with advertising.

1. A lot of people genuinely swear by them. Whether it's iPhones or Macs etc. Plenty of users much prefer those choices for a variety of reasons to Android or Windows etc.

2. Hype.  It's less about the advertising and more about the hype that revolves around the product launches and the media store thats generated because they only do 2 announcements a year for their new products.

3. Leading to fashion.  They are still seen by a lot of people that don't really follow tech as a bit of status symbol and fashion accessory.  That's usually lead by celebrities using the products, or them being featured in TV shows as the main devices characters use, and they appear in a lot of US shows ... and everytime, Apple never pays anything for that.  They may supply the products, but it's not product placement in the strictest sense that a company would pay to sponser the show and in return the characters make a big deal about using a Windows Surface tablet, and using Bing to search the net etc.

Advertising certainly helps Apple, but I believe Samsung holds that the title for using it the most to achieve the market share it has.",null,0,null,1425052747,null,0,false,0,coz0337,null,t3_2xcdo2,null,t1_coz0337,null,t1_coywssj,null,null,null,1427487160,null,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1,null

Young people have the strength and opportunities to change their circumstances, the elderly are more or less stuck with what they're given if they aren't already wealthy.

Because we can't just let these people go into poverty, the support they get from the state needs to match the ever-changing economy.

Because as much as they won't admit it, elderly people are generally quite dangerous drivers and need to be encouraged to keep off the roads. Not only that, but some elderly people have great difficulty in getting about so public transport is generally a necessity if they intend to keep up an active social life.

Several scenes in *Last Christmas*, including this one: [""I will mark you, Santa...""](http://youtu.be/Rpyk_dAyxgs)

And so many more that I'm too lazy to track down.

Frankly, you're just wrong. Balotelli put in more of an effort than most of the team last night. He certainly tried harder than Sturridge, who didn't even try to challenge for the ball most of the time. It's not the first time, either, though it's hard for him to show it when he never gets a chance to start.

He can fit a ""high press, possession style"" about as well as Sturridge or Lambert can. Neither of them can press better than Balo.

null,false,DevilishRogue,cnty-england,England,null,"&gt; The need for the aggrieved party to feel those who have wronged them have paid a sufficient price is still a subjective element.

No it isn't. The degree to which it is needed is subjective but the fact that it is needed is not.

&gt; Some would place more emphasis on the effect of the punishment on the offender - whether it is proportionate to what it achieves, rather than how it compares with what the defendant did.

A punishment must fit the crime for justice to be seen to be done, but as for the effect on the offender, that is irrelevant. A man earning lots of money will suffer more than a man earning minimum wage from being sent to prison and losing their job but whilst that can be argued as mitigation the rich should not be able to buy their way out of prison because it has a proportionately worse effect on them, which is the logical conclusion of that argument. 

I'm not sure why you feel that over the last few decades sentencing has shifted more towards vengeance rather than reform. Victim impact statements? That seems to me more about ensuring the sentence matches the crime than avenging those wronged per se. Not to mention that sentencing times have fallen significantly over previous decades.

And whilst probation and rehabilitative funding hasn't increased consistently crime has fallen both proportionately and actually over recent decades. 

As for the sentencing council, of course there is no proof that financial considerations lead to shorter sentences but there is an awfully convenient correlation between the two, particularly as the cost of keeping a person in prison has risen significantly over the same decades period we've been talking about.",null,0,null,1425054128,null,0,false,0,coz0v3v,null,t3_2x87so,null,t1_coz0v3v,null,t1_coyvozj,null,null,null,1427487522,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

In the UK there was a feeling that the deficit had to be controlled to keep our borrowing costs down.

In general yes its impossible to compare the UK with any other country. But we are talking about a very specific subject here so it is rather a good way of gauging the success of certain policies related to criminal punishment.

&gt;  We have a very distinct culture to them

I would argue that compared to other cultures around the world British culture is similar in many aspects to (if such a thing even exists) pan-European culture. We share in ideals such as the rule of law, human rights, freedom of expression and upholding of democracy. We are also rather socialist (NHS, welfare state) just as many European countries are. In fact I would go as far as to say some European countries are closer to us culturally now than even Australia or Canada. The most popular sport in Britain being football just as it is in many European countries.

&gt; differing crime levels

Well this is my entire point, we have higher crime levels because we are a country which focuses on punishment rather than stopping it happening again in the future (rehabilitation). Which simply doesn't work as the statistics show.

&gt;  Not to mention that sentencing has fallen from decades past.

This has happened in literally every developed country on the planet due to the banning of lead in petrol and other toxic aggression inducing chemicals in the atmosphere being reduced.

&gt; Basically what you are trying to say is that justice for the victims of crime or for society doesn't matter and you're wrong.

Not at all. What I am saying is that justice should not be based upon emotions or how you *feel* at the particular time of the sentencing but instead upon the extent of that persons crimes and the perpetrators morality.

&gt; It has nothing to do with emotions and everything to do with justice not only being done but being seen to be done.

This is exactly my point. Firstly you say that ""It has nothing to do with emotions and everything to do with justice"" which is fine. But you go on to say that ""not only being done but being seen to be done.""

* Labour (275.3) + SNP (44.9) = 320 (**3 seats short**; figures rounded)

* Tory (278.1) + Lib Dem (25.9) + Ukip (3.3) + DUP (8) = 315 **(8 seats short**)

* Tory (278.1) + Lib Dem (25.9) = 304 (**19 seats short**)

* Labour (275.3) + Lib Dem (25.9) + Green (1) = 302 (**21 seats short**)

And one he apparently didn't think of:

* Labour (275.3) + Lib Dem (25.9) + Green (1) + SNP (44.9) = **347**

This is the only remotely likely scenario - and by remotely likely I of course mean still definitely impossible - that produces a parliamentary majority (obviously it works even if you drop the Green Party but I figure if Labour manage to accommodate the SNP and the Lib Dems they can probably convince the Greens, too).

He also doesn't mention the SDLP, who would likely prop up Labour, but May2015 [only expect them to win three seats](http://may2015.com/category/seat-calculator/) so that's probably why.

All these proposals contain totally implausible coalitions, only one of which results in a majority government. The Lib Dems won't work with Ukip. The anti-austerity Greens and SNP won't work with the pro-austerity Labour and Lib Dem.

The student loan is a fantastic tool that allows anyone to go to University and then not pay anything back until they are earning a good amount, and even then its progressive so that the better you are doing, the more you pay back. Ergo, the better quality your degree was, you could argue that you pay more for it in the long run as your earnings potential is increased.

Indeed it's a much longer story than you'd believe. Or is that ""tall story""?! :-

And the astronomical levels of confusion that our politics and media seem to churn out, again Dr. North investigates:-

[EU politics: fantasy meets fantasy](http://www.eureferendum.com/blogview.aspx?blogno=85291)

If you want some lines to remember the EU by when it's finally gone (only to be replaced by some other illusion no doubt):-

&gt;*Meanwhile, George Osborne has been unrolling another fantasy, this one to BBC's Newsnight, telling us that Britain had joined the EU as an ""economic proposition"" rather than signing up to a political project.*

&gt;*Other countries joined for different reasons, he said. ""When it's not working economically for Britain, that’s why we get this debate about the membership of the EU. I'm someone who wants to stay in the EU ... but it has to be a reformed EU. I think it is causing problems for us"".*

&gt;*And this is why we're getting nowhere here. The Italians are pretending that we are not going to have to pay some money that the Commission is saying we must, while Osborne is pretending we joined the EU ""economic proposition"" when, quite obviously, we joined a political project.*

&gt;*Everybody is pretending here that their particular corner of the EU is something it isn't, and then to cap it all, Osborne joins with his boss in lusting after something neither of them can have – a reformed EU. One of these days, these people are going to grow up, face reality and talk about the EU as it really is, rather than they would like it to be – or think it should be. Then, perhaps we might just start making some progress. But, as always, it would be unwise to hold our breath.*

I think one of the troubling things with our modern media is it's lack of memory where the latest decision on Osborne being rebuked is ""just another breaking-news story to fill the day"":-

[EU budget – the lies they tell](http://www.eureferendum.com/blogview.aspx?blogno=85300)

It probably comes across as Osborne ""stretching the truth"" or ""exaggerating"" but what I think it does is confuse and confound with an avalanche of detail and delays.

And far far from being done looping back to the process of globalization on another different issue concerning finance:-

[Autumn statement: the hidden hand of globalisation](http://www.eureferendum.com/blogview.aspx?blogno=85349)

&gt;*In fact, though, the EU is not in the frame. The key players, as we remarked in November last year are G20 and UNCTAD (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development)*

&gt;*What is so interesting though is when the G20 met to agree the OECD plan, the November communiqué effectively has the European Council ceding authority to G20/OECD, a recognition that, when it comes to dealing with multinational businesses, global solutions are required. Even the Commission sung the praises of the OECD.*

Ideally you'll run surpluses in high-growth years so you can better afford large deficits when you enter a recession.

When the bond reaches maturity the government has to pay back the full £X. Generally that is not possible as the government doesn't have that money laying around as they have spent it on something (otherwise what is the point in borrowing it), so the government issues a new bond and uses the money from the new one to pay of the old one. However if in the interim interest rates have gone up they will only be able to issue the new bond at a much higher interest rate. Which then means the government has to pay out the higher amount for the every year for the duration of the new bond. The interest rates the government can get now are temporary, they aren't fixed for however long the government wants to keep that money. Governments can go bankrupt. It's not very likely for us, but it's not a case of the only bad thing that can happen is going bankrupt.

The good news is that people are very forgiving. I've done fucking crazy shit boozed up and have maintained those relationships.

The most important reason for not drinking on anti-D's is that it can render them almost ineffective. Also, the last thing you want with depression is that awful 2-3 days of post-binge paranoia that comes with a hangover. Try to be a bit kinder to yourself.

I still drink, but very much in moderation compared to my previous booze intake, because I *really* want my meds to work. It's hard enough finding a set you can live with in the first place without adding further complications to them.

This attitude is of fundamental difference being that we're allowed to do anything that isn't specifically prohibited but they are allowed to do only what is specifically permitted. Also, I'm not sure where you get that Britain is rather socialist as the opposite is true, as exemplified by New Labour.

Our police aren't routinely armed and have a history of being of the people, unlike the more militarised police forces of many of our European neighbours, too, so really all elements of our criminal justice system differ significantly from Europe.

As for how our system operates, it rightly focuses on putting the needs of the individual (the victim) ahead of those of society (the risk of reoffending by the perpetrator). But to say that the UK doesn't focus on rehabilitation as well ignores reality. Recidivism rates are closely monitored and of deep concern. That said there isn't money to throw around and it is more important that the public have faith in the justice system and don't start taking the law into their won hands than it is that offenders remain on the straight and narrow once released from prison.

Because due to heavy socialist sentiment in the North, people were adamant on keeping their unskilled labour jobs as they had received no training or education that would allow them to compete in the new Britain. However for all their protesting, little did they realise that this should have benefited their future generations. Now we have the situation where all these families who relied on unskilled labour are stuck in a rut where their children pick up the same pessimistic attitudes and destructive lifestyles that possess their parents.

&gt;Its the governments job to encourage businesses to set up in areas that need it through using tax incentives and enterprise zones as a carrot and increased taxes and regulations as a stick.

Really there should be nothing that prevents Northerners from setting up businesses just like they do in the South. The transition was always going to be difficult for Northerners but their indignance and reliance on the state has only made it worse for themselves over time.

&gt;Apart from the government would rather have a London centric economy based on finical services because that's where Westminster is so the politicians directly Benifit from it being that way.

In terms of how politicians benefit then it makes no difference, politicians don't need the wealthy to be physically close to them in order for them to have mutually beneficial business and political arrangements with each other.",null,0,null,1425057437,null,0,false,0,coz2t1q,null,t3_2xcgtz,null,t1_coz2t1q,null,t1_coz2asu,null,null,null,1427488429,null,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1,null
null,false,Mr56,,curmudgeonly commie,null,"&gt; Surely doing both - working on my own behalf and through my representative - is the tactic most likely to be effective?

There's the issue of focus. There's an opportunity cost to participating in representative politics, time spent writing to your MP is time not spent doing other things. Given a limited amount of time, resources and energy I'd prefer to spend them on the things that I think will be most effective.

Writing to your MP, for instance, is highly unlikely to change something like government policy on workfare. The coalition government has an overall majority, so will always win any vote on government policy, and in an age of career politicians and three line whips on every little thing, you're almost certainly not going to persuade enough Lib Dem and Con MPs to change their mind on this stuff. Voting Labour won't help either, since Labour have supported workfare both in government and opposition, with a few lame caveats about how it's so terrible when it's a nasty big company like Tesco instead of a [totally benign charity like the Sally Army](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/zinnia-jones/the-salvation-armys-histo_b_4422938.html) getting forced labour for free.

Side note - I'm not a total absolutist on these things, incidentally, where it seems like the only way to effect a situation is to engage with MPs, write letters, collect signatures for petitions, etc. I'm going to do that. E.g. I've done some bits of individual asylum seeker support stuff, where you're basically trying to help an individual navigate their way through bureaucracy and show the officials who hold the power to make or break their application that they have support, roots in the community and whatnot. In that situation, probably the worst thing you can do is be all confrontational and ""Rah, we're the scary anarchists,"" since that's just going to make things worse for the person you're trying to help.",null,0,null,1425057438,null,0,false,0,coz2t26,null,t3_2x8p9j,null,t1_coz2t26,null,t1_coz15bi,null,null,null,1427488429,null,4,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,4,null

First fact: color is entirely relative to the observer and depends upon the quality of light that hits it.

Second fact: this dress is BLUE AND BLACK.

Third MOST IMPORTANT fact: there is a YELLOW (warm spectrum) light shining down and washing across the dress.

Okay, so taking into account these three facts, I can begin to explain how people see a dress that is WHITE and GOLD.

It all revolves around fact 1. Color is a perceived notion determined by the material and the light being cast onto the material. There are two ways that light mixes to create colors. [Additive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_color) and [Subtractive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtractive_color) mixing. If we take a yellow light and cast it onto a blue surface, we see a white surface based on additive color mixing. The black of the dress is being washed out by the overpowering light.

Now, little did I know how significant him being a Chelsea fan was. 2 days ago he sent me a text asking whether I'd like to go to the Capital One Cup final with him as he could get us some tickets, as you'd expect I was ecstatic, but the problem was the tickets cost £90 and I had no money. This guy/fellow Chelsea fan which I met just 5 months ago, with his own money bought a ticket for me and now I'm going to watch my favourite time live for the first ever time this Sunday.

Most Western systems have some level of all of them, but tend to be shifting towards the latter two. But which one or ones should be the goal of the system is a subjective part. For example, it is arguable that the first kind does nothing to improve society.

In English/UK law, generally restorative justice is what the civil laws are all about - if someone has cost you something illegally, you sue them and get your money back. As that's been increasingly inaccessible for most there's been a shift to criminal compensation (starting when the CICB - now CICA - was set up in the 60s), which is mostly handled by an extra fine on all those convicted which goes into a pool handed out to the victims of crimes.

On the shift in stance, that was based on new measures in relation to victims, impact statements, pushes for victims' rights and so on. While there may need to be a balance struck between the historical style (where victims were no more than witnesses as far as the court was concerned) and giving victims complete control over trials, I'm not sure if the current situation is suitable (I'd want to do more research).

It's also worth remembering that s [the Sentencing Council notes](http://www.sentencingcouncil.org.uk/about-sentencing/sentencing-myths/#1) on their website, the prison population in the England and Wales nearly doubled between 1993 and 2012, and the report they cite shows that the average sentence has increased, with the number of indeterminate sentences going up by factor of 4. Whether or not there's a causal link between decreasing crime rates and increasing prison sentences is an interesting question - and I'm not sure if there's much research on it.

Last time I looked into the issue I only found a couple of studies - most are from the US and focus on things like the effectiveness of capital punishment. But there were a couple, iirc either finding that there was minimal link between sentence length and rehabilitation/re-offending rates or that longer sentences correlated with a higher chance of re-offending. There's some evidence that it is more the *probability* of being punished, rather than the severity of the punishment that affects behaviour.

But obviously there is need for more research - as always.

The stuff about financial considerations is a bit odd; if the cost of keeping someone in prison has gone up and the sentencing council were focusing on that aspect you would expect the prison population and average sentences to have decreased, not increased.",null,0,null,1425061234,null,0,false,0,coz53xt,null,t3_2x87so,null,t1_coz53xt,null,t1_coz0v3v,null,null,null,1427489573,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Absolutely. Anti-depressants don't make you do anything.

Lifted that quote from towards the end. Interesting to see that even a religious group is not in favour of this clause.  They argue it's not christian to refuse service to a particular group ie discriminate. They also point out the damage to employment potential for groups likely to invoke the clause. i.e would companies be put off christian employees knowing they might legally refuse to work. vice versa, would athiests make better employees?

Of course, anything can happen. Kiev is the capital city so it's more of a political target than other cities. And there was a bomb set off at a pro-Kiev rally in Kharkiv last week, but no one really seems to know much about who was behind that or if it was even related to the Russian conflict.

At current interest rates that means we will be paying around £1.5 billion a year in interest for this. This is £1.5 billion which we then can't spend on other things. This is also with the low interest rates, if the interest rates go back up to the 4% mark before we reissue the bond (which has been the recent historical value) then we will be paying £4 billion a year for this money we are borrowing. That's for just the borrowing for this one year. Our total debt is £1400 billion. At a 4% interest rate that costs £56 billion per year, that's half the amount we spend on Education. After a point, burdening ourselves with more debt is counterproductive.

Keep it well away from your wheels, tires and brakes. SERIOUSLY! Wash any drops off with a detergent and lots of water. I have heard people having accidents when applied to wheels, as it can drip onto tire and cause a slide.

Clean bike very very well. Very very well. Apply chain cleaner to chain.

Take off as much bodywork as possible, paint on ACF-50 with paintbrush and wipe off excess with a rag. Cover the entire bike apart from above and any part that you touch with your hands or feet or bum (it be slippery, yo!). Paint it on the electrical wiring and connections apart from the battery terminals and your italian bike will thank you for it. This will hopefully form a barrier that will stop water getting into the electrics.

My bike is covered in the stuff all year around. It lives outside, is 14 years old and looks almost like new.

Also, don't let your bike get that dirty, and don't fall behind on maintenance. Bikes get very expensive when they aren't maintained, especially Aprillias. Is yours a 2 stroke?

I mean, there's this from The Guardian, but it's out of date:

http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/mar/08/homelessness-statistics-data

&gt;Only a small number come from abroad - a total of 1,810 foreign nationals were accepted as homeless between 1 October and 31 December 2011. Of these, 280 were from Eastern Europe, 300 were from other EU countries and 1,240 were from the rest of the world. Foreign nationals accounted for 14% of all acceptances, the same as in the same quarter last year, when there were 1,500 acceptances.

We could probably extrapolate that if if 1/3 of the homeless people in London are EU nationals, then a significant proportion of that 1,810 are in the Capital, meaning that the number of homeless people in cities outside of London will be mostly British nationals.

That's without pointing out that, y'know, even if one in three homeless people is a foreign national, that means that MOST homeless people are British anyway.

Then again, that article has 1,800 of 69,000 homeless people being foreign, which isn't a third across the country anyway.",null,0,null,1425063287,null,0,false,0,coz6c7d,null,t3_2xcdo2,null,t1_coz6c7d,null,t1_coz5srs,null,null,null,1427490147,null,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12,null

* The current legislation puts a lot of people off which is the basis for these points. These are people who would rather commute by bike than by car into busy city centres.
* If there were a greater uptake of motorcycles, this would bode well for the UKs manufacturing industry which supplies the motorcycle industry, bringing in more money and possibly jobs.
* It puts more money into dealerships, from more bikes being around, and more servicing happening.
* Motorcycles effectively reduce everyones transport times by being a more efficient user of road space. 
* This means that the UK economy would see a boost alone purely by having more bikes taking up less space. In turn this would encourage more firms to use the roads and get a greater economic use of time.
* More money to insurance companies, ie - more tax money for guvment
* Cheap (safe) motorcycle parking would appeal to us who commute by bike and could be provided quite easily with little modification to surroundings 
* There would be more tests being taken = more money again

Firstly the locals are apposed to having 60K football fans around their neighborhood every other weekend and week nights - and also the stadium is not 'geared up' to host football. Having been to the stadium for Rugby, I totally agree. Mainly because the Twickenham train station is relatively small for two sets of rival fans to be arriving on (not a problem in rugby as emotions are nowhere near as high) so risks of charging and people falling onto the tracks. Also, the station is the other side of a MAIN road into London. The logistics of getting football fans to orderly cross that road while not shutting down one of the two major entrances into London from the West (the other being the M4) would be almost impossible.

On a more positive note, the actual situation regarding the development of the Stamford Bridge site is in better shape than ever. For the majority of the time which we have pursued a stadium expansion the conservatives have been in control of the Hammersmith and Fulham borough, and they were very much against plans to increase the capacity. However, recently Labour gained power of the area who are much more open to the expansion, especially due to the improvements to cycle paths and the rail links at Fulham Broadway.

But nothing will be made open to public knowledge until things are secured or if they need local backing.

Yeah he does say to scrap winter fuel etc but if you means-test pensions you can add it back to poor pensioners by upping the pension. His general point is to stop giving money/freebies to wealthy pensioners.

It's a weak article by Economist standards IMHO though:

IIRC, the state pension got boosted because for a while before that it had fallen behind, either due to not being pegged to inflation or to the wrong measurement (I have a vague recollection it might actually have been Brown who started it). Either way it seems to me to be a bit of a fallacy, I think the pension should be considered against what is livable rather than what it has been historically. 

Winter fuel etc, it's been said that it is uneconomical to means test it. The admin cost isn't justified by the savings in payments. Taking these away and increasing state pension to compensate can be done for no extra cost if the state pension is being means-tested of course. 

The idea of means-testing the state pension is a bit questionable because they have supposedly paid for it through taxes. Yeah this was a bit of a fib and it's not like the money actually went into a pension pot, but it's tantamount to miss-selling if you're telling young taxpayers they'll get a state pension and then taking it away once they become pensionable.

1. All players will miss chances, I know, Soldado has missed a fair few but this one wasn't the worst in the world (its not even the worst of this season Google Junior Malanda or Phillip Hoffman if you want to see truly [physics bending misses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0jv-Ft2HO4).

2. We're not helping. The guy is desperate for some minutes. When you're 26 games into the season and you've only played 7 games worth - in stops and starts - coming off the bench, you are not going to be at your very sharpest (or most confident).

3. The problem is mental, not physical. When people talk about strikers that did really badly in the PL (top of the list Torres/Shevchenko) these were players who as a consequence of repetitive and often potentially career ending surgery failed to regain the form of their glory years. With Soldado there is no such problem which is why his approach play and off the ball work remains good (all that is shot is his confidence in the box). The question for me is what support can the club give him to improve his confidence - there are a number of sports therapists that do just that.

4. What a waste of £26m. Just writing off the cost would be silly - especially if it is something we can improve. The bar is not super high 10-15 league goals is all we need from him in support of Kane. Who around the league can guarantee us that without harming the progress of Kane who is affordable?

null,false,DevilishRogue,cnty-england,England,null,"&gt; there were a couple, iirc either finding that there was minimal link between sentence length and rehabilitation/re-offending rates or that longer sentences correlated with a higher chance of re-offending. There's some evidence that it is more the probability of being punished, rather than the severity of the punishment that affects behaviour.

I'm afraid you do not recall correctly. Short sentences have a strong correlative relationship with high recidivism whereas long sentences have a strong correlation with low recidivism. I can't source this myself but have enough experience in the area that I'm confident you'll find this true on any studies that were done in the UK. As for probability, that tends to be a stronger consideration if offenders have not experienced a long sentence for previous offences, IIRC, although I am less certain of this than about the long sentence/short sentence correlations.

&gt; The stuff about financial considerations is a bit odd; if the cost of keeping someone in prison has gone up and the sentencing council were focusing on that aspect you would expect the prison population and average sentences to have decreased, not increased.

Human rights legislation, risk aversion due to the potential to be sued, staff-conditions, etc. have all pushed up the cost of keeping prisoners jailed. There is (and has been since well into the previous government) a strong push to keep sentences shorter and to look for alternatives to prison. In and of itself this is not necessarily a bad thing, looking after the taxpayer's interests. But when someone tries to kill a priests family including his children and is only prevented from doing so by the timely arrival of the police yet gets barely a year per person attacked the legitimacy of the current justice system should be called into question.

On a personal note, whilst the principles of English Common Law are perfectly sound and valid the actual administration of the justice system in England and Wales is something of a joke. Justice is almost a commodity, with the very rich and the professional criminals able to stack the system in their favour whilst the generally law abiding are targeted for often innocuous breaches of a plethora of new legislation that not even the greatest legal minds of our time can expect to know in full, but they are easy targets and always pay their dues.

It is not illegal (ie, a crime) to breach copyright for personal use.  Doing it as part of a business (read: selling dodgy DVDs and similar) is a crime, though.  

It is unlawful to breach copyright - which means that you can be sued by the copyright holder.  They can sue you for their costs in finding you, the costs in suing you, plus the money they lost from the sale. This would sting (an hour of a lawyers time to write you a nastygram is expensive, after all) - but it isn't terribly likely, 'cos the copyright holder will clear the costs of a DVD sale (read a couple of quid) and has to spend a couple of grand on lawyers to do so.  And you might win anyway, which leaves them with a big bill.  However some rights holders will do this as a deterrent.

It is a crime to watch TV without a license.  Streaming can count for this - basically the law is technology neutral, so as far as the law is concerned it doesn't matter if the picture is tranmitted via analogue transmitters, digital transmitters, satalites, cable TV, or the internet:  if a program is broadcast by a regulated TV station, and you recieve it at (or nearly at) the same time they broadcast it, you need a license.

If you're not watching live streams, then you're in the clear, absolutely.  If you are watching live streams, then you might be OK if it's not a station that's put itself under UK regulation (note:  some 'foreign' stations have done this so they can get onto Sky, so it might not be obvious if they count.  Obviously the BBC and ITV and Sky and so on count, but obscure dutch channels might, too).

Hope that makes sense!

However, if it gets to a point where he is a detriment to the team, and is no longer performing or willing to put in the effort, then he should be let go. The transfer fee may be small but the reduction in wages is huge. 

He commands a massive wage, and is currently a leader on our team. He also is one of those guys who doesn't seem to react well to adversity, and if it ever gets to the point where he will need to sit a few games while someone else shines in his place, I have a feeling he will not take that well. 

City need to look at United as an example. They focused too much on their veteran players without bringing in adequate replacements, and now they are in a very difficult transitioning period. 

I still feel rather bitter towards yaya on account of his attitude in the summer which carried over into the early season.

Take for example the media industry. Because of the high number of folks looking to get in it's often who you know that matters. 

My own story: Currently I am working at the BBC on a training scheme for minorities. It wasnt easy to get to this point however. After I graduated I had to go on jobseekers for a while. My local paper had a big office building down the road, opposite the job centre. I'd walked past it since I was a kid but had never been in before. On a whim, I thought I'd head in after a JSA meeting and see if I could enquire about work placements. I approached the receptionist and asked if I could talk to someone. The editor was ""too busy"" to talk face to face, so I was given her email address and I subsequently sent a long a message asking if I could do some unpaid work experience. I was very politely turned down however, with an email saying they're all full for the summer.

Fast forward a few weeks - I was having lunch with a friend when I passingly mentioned my problem. She told me she knows someone who works at the paper. I got this woman's email address and sent her a message asking again if could get a placement. A couple days later she responded, and I booked a week the following month. 

When I got to the paper, I was surprised to find I was the only Asian person on the newsdesk. Keep in mind that this is an area where over half the population are of Asian decent. I continued to do unpaid work there for over a year, on and off, seeing a number of white faces pass through this newsdesk. During this time I started a journalism course, and my editor kept enticing me back for work experience, saying ""Local news is a great place to learn the skills of the job"" etc, leading me to believe there was a paid job at the end of it. 

A year passed, and when I finally finished my journalism course, I emailed him asking about any job openings, but was greeted with silence. I then emailed another editor, who said they will ""keep me on file"". This is after a year of me bringing in great stories, including one of the most popular one's the papers ever had.

About a month or two after these emails, I got a message asking if I was available for work - unpaid however. I was pissed, primarily because I knew that they had given jobs to other trainee reporters during those two months of waiting (during which I did another two unpaid internships, ironically).

Now my questions to you are: 

1) do you think it's right that my local newspaper, providing news for mainly Asian people, had no paid Asian staff? How can the news they provide reflect the interests of the community, if nobody bloody lives there, or has ties the community in any way?

and 2) Why was it that those people got jobs, whereas I was asked to commit my time for free, despite proving I am capable of the job? Keep in mind I come from a very low income family and had little to no money for the entire time I was studying/working for free.

It's subtle reasons like these why affirmative action is absolutely necessary. And I appreciate it is difficult for white folk to empathise with problems people like me face, because it may seem as if we're taking jobs away from deserving white people. But in reality, these are jobs that should already be given to minorities, but decades of subconscious and subtle prejudice have created an unrepresentative allocation of jobs between races.

TL:DR Because equality. fairness, social justice, upward mobility, etc

Doing it properly and putting ""X"" against your chosen candidate and writing the X in your own blood is a spoiled ballot, because the blood is personally identifiable.

But more interestingly the most important part of this policy - which the economist seems to completely miss is that it's economically sensible in terms of the debt. What are we doing now? Austerity. Why? Because it's wrong to have huge debts that the future generation will pay. Now when is bringing the cost of tuition down bad? Because the debt gets written off for low earners anyway! 



But hang on. That debt isn't just going poof into the ether, every penny that we write off in the future is a penny that we have to find in a future budget. So actually, while the upfront cost (which is covered as they've explained) masks a reduction in liabilities that the government holds with these debts. We already know that the expected cost of writing off those loans has skyrocketed by 40% (before a single person has payed a penny back), we massively mitigate that by massively lowering the debt we issue.

Toure-Skrtel-Lovren

Markovic-Hendo-Allen-Moreno

Coutinho-Sterling

Balotelli 

I'd give Can a rest because he was running on empty after an hour yesterday and has looked sluggish for the last few games. Give Ibe a rest because he's played quite a lot recently and could do well coming off the bench against a tired defense. Hendo and Allen are self explanatory. 

A lot of people will disagree but I really think we should start Balotelli. He's been playing well when he has played recently and we're probably going to be on the back foot for much of the game and when we can get the ball forward, we need someone up top that can hold the ball up and either draw a foul or allow players to get forward and bring other players into the game. This is Balotelli's biggest strength. He did it well yesterday and picked out some good passes to find Sturridge further forward. If we get Coutinho and Sterling running off him and getting forward, we can hit them with quick counter attacks and hopefully score some goals. Sturridge can come on as a sub if Balotelli doesn't play well or if we are chasing the game.

If over 50% of the 18-24 vote isn't appealing enough to appeal to, is an extra 10-20% really going to make that much difference to who politicians target?

It seems to be portrayed that no young people are voting and there's this huge well of untapped votes up for grabs. The fact is the 18-24 segment has the fewest people in total and over half of them vote. The amount of people that leaves who aren't voting but could be convinced to is relatively small in terms of influencing who political parties aim to appeal to.

From Carl Sagan:

""As an example of skeptical thinking, Sagan offers a story concerning a fire-breathing dragon that lives in his garage. When he persuades a rational, open-minded visitor to meet the dragon, the visitor remarks that they are unable to see the creature. Sagan replies that he ""neglected to mention that she's an invisible dragon"". The visitor suggests spreading flour on the floor so that the creature's footprints might be seen, which Sagan says is a good idea ""but this dragon floats in the air"". When the visitor considers using an infra-red camera to view the creature's invisible fire, Sagan explains that the fire is heatless. He continues to counter every proposed physical test with a reason why the test will not work.

Sagan concludes by asking ""Now what's the difference between an invisible, incorporeal, floating dragon who spits heatless fire and no dragon at all? If there's no way to disprove my contention, no conceivable experiment that would count against it, what does it mean to say that my dragon exists? **Your inability to invalidate my hypothesis is not at all the same thing as proving it true.**""",null,0,null,1425069376,null,0,false,0,coza008,null,t3_2x9h69,null,t1_coza008,null,t1_coytjaz,null,null,null,1427491855,null,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8,null

&gt;

&gt;The __Christadelphians__ are a [millenarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millenarian) [Christian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity) group who hold a view of [Biblical Unitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_Unitarianism). The movement developed in the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom) and [North America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America) in the 19th century around the teachings of [John Thomas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Thomas_(Christadelphian\)), who coined the name *Christadelphian*   from the Greek for ""Brethren in Christ"".   

&gt;Basing their beliefs solely on the [Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible), Christadelphians differ from mainstream [Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity) in a number of doctrinal areas. For example, they reject the [Trinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity) and the [immortality of the soul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality_of_the_soul), believing these to be corruptions of original Christian teaching.

&gt;They were initially found predominantly in the developed English-speaking world, but expanded in developing countries after the Second World War. There are estimated to be 60,000 Christadelphians in around 120 countries worldwide. Congregations are usually referred to as *ecclesias*.

The problem is basically that they don't know what someone's income is (or whether they are HR or not) at the time they'd need to make the payments - they don't really know until after the end of the year, maybe not even until tax returns are due in (for November 2015 winter fuel payment, they wont get tax returns relating to that period until 31 January 2017). It's not really acceptable to have a system with a high chance of resulting in people not getting paid when they need it or getting paid too much and unexpectedly landed with a bill - especially not pensioners. To mitigate that you need to have people figuring it out, which costs money, and like tax credits system you still get mistakes. 

This may well change in the future once real time payroll filing is running properly, automatically giving HMRC reliable and up to date information (yeah pensions are paid and taxed more or less like payroll).

You're taking it from the 'more hours if offered' direction....

I'd rather take it from the direction of job security and employees' rights. Someone doing 40 hours a week on a ZHC is going to be happy with that... until the point when they're suddenly doing 8 hours a week, or none at all. ZHCs are flexible with that. There's work when there's work, you can take it or leave it. When there isn't work, you're employed in name only. You have no rights as an employee, because technically you're not one, and you can't really claim anything reliably because you have no idea when your next shift will be. You can't make plans.

In general, the only people I can see being happy on ZHCs are people who absolutely need that flexibility, and people who are getting a steady amount of work that works for them just as well as a traditional contract would (just minus the employees' rights and pension etc.. but who needs those?).

I have been on a ZHC (still am, technically). Shortly before the olympics, I joined a contractor to do event stewarding and parking management. Throughout the olympics, I had plenty of work, to the point where I was quite concerned about the arrangements regarding breaks (they were legally sound, but literally at the very minimum to be so). As soon as the olympics finished, myself and the other few thousand people they'd hired were left without shifts we could do. Being nationwide, there was actually quite a bit of work (as they promised prior to the olympics), but for anyone (like myself) unable to travel across the country weekly for a few hours minimum wage, it was a complete cop-out. Realising that the company had no obligation to lay on transport or have local work available, or indeed do anything apart from pay me for time spent signed in at a venue (excluding 20 minutes out of an 9 hour shift. Unpaid break), and finding that any work I could take from them would cost more in travel than it would earn me, I packed it in.

This is an absolute no questions asked decision. Studge has to start, we know what he offers, we have to be incredible disciplined and defend from the front vs. City, he gives us that and scored goals. 

He is our best striker without any shadow of a doubt and potentially our best player. Risking Ballotelli against the league champions, Christ almighty what am I fucking reading in here? If he starts, so be it, but Sturridge has to start alongside if he does. 

This sub rarely surprises me because you can predict it after a while in here but this is insane. 2 fucking bad games. He's got 2 cracking goals in a handful of matches since he came back from a 5 month spell out and suddenly he's not good enough to start in our most important game yet because of two poor games.  

I'd go sterling studge, without a doubt and use Ballo late on if needs be. 

Edit: Lads are actually calling for him to start INSTEAD of Studge...we've seen him up front alone, we've listened to people moan about how poor he is up there so why on earth would we decide to revert to that option against Manchester bloody City",null,0,null,1425070365,null,0,1425070702,0,cozal9x,null,t3_2xcrpz,null,t1_cozal9x,null,t1_coz54x1,null,null,null,1427492130,null,10,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,10,null

There has been a lot of accommodation development in the centre, though admittedly in a higher price bracket than most HMOs. In a cultural city like Bristol the pull is towards the centre: from the universities' point of view it would be more difficult to build a satellite housing campus than to simply open a teaching campus in a nearby town and let the private housing market develop there.

That all makes sense. 

&gt;HMRC can't afford the very best people. No political party is ever going to agree to let HMRC pay the kind of salaries that are needed for them to.

I find that surprising. I have a handful of friends who work for KPMG and ATOS and while they are well off it's nowhere near at private jet level. 

I suppose the trouble is that people with that sort of expertise tend to move in their own ecosystem. Even if they never work for the Big Four, they socialise with lots of people who do, and seem to end up being quite sympathetic to their world-view.

Yeah.......You know exactly what I meant.

Then they could sell off those debts to someone else who would do the same etc.  These bad debts would be tangled in a mass of contracts and drag everything else down when the borrowers defaulted.  Things like this used to be regulated a lot more heavily.

Um....No.  No, I didn't.  Look for the inverted commas.....Look.  Keep looking....Keep looking.... There they are!  Yay! It was a rhetorical quote trying to illustrate the poster's naivety!

My point was he/she is wrong when they blame the issue on 7 figure salaries and tax dodgers.  Both things have existed long before the economic near-collapse.  It's down to massive deregulation in the 80's.  Something which, by the way - before we all start having a pop at that - also introduced a massive range of benefits into the British economy and massively contributed to almost 3 decades of prosperity that *everyone* (not just the bankers) took advantage of.

A while a go, I would have said; ""find him, bring him back to the UK and put him in prison"". Now my thought is to drop a bomb on him after the intelligence has been made clear of his involvement. He has decided to leave Britain and become a combatant on a battlefield — to stand next to innocent people — while they've been brutally murdered, in the most horrific fashion. 

I'm a liberal and have voted for Labour in the past, but the extreme left shit is really turning me off. It seems to be even worse in America with progressives going too far with it as well.

1. Voting is a part of democracy (I puke at that word and its connection to war) and in order for us to get what we want and not be dictated to by an absolute ruler we have an opportunity to say yes or no. Voting is our opportunity.  You should want to be heard by the people who tell you how your kids will schooled,  or how much pension or working hours or council tax you'll get. By not voting you're denying yourself only. 

2. Easier for whom? The government don't want you to vote because then they don't have to take you into consideration when trying to cling to power. The pensioners get the goodies cos they give the government the votes that keep them in power. By not voting you're saying 'nah don't worry about me, I'll be alright with fuck all you do for me' 

I'd believe you if you said that you don't vote cos it makes no sense and they're all the same, and that you can't be arsed.

If they've got a boss, letter straight off to them. Mention specifically that when your contract is up you will not be renewing because of their unreasonable behaviour. 

You can go to the council over the noise, petty and sometimes a waste of time but a letter and some hassle for them is good. 

The main thing to do though is to very specifically contact your landlord, there's at least a postal address in your contract. Tell them that you are not renewing and why. An agent doesn't really care if you don't renew, its a pain in the arse to re-let a property and hampers business growth, but they make more money from a let than a renewal. The landlord is different though. It costs money (minimum £100, most likely more) to find a new tenant through an agent. If the agent is costing them money through unreasonable behaviour they won't be happy and will dis instruct the agent, and that is how you hurt them.

I had a look through [this briefing paper](http://www.parliament.uk/Templates/BriefingPapers/Pages/BPPdfDownload.aspx?bp-id=RP12-71), which is based on [these statistics](http://www.no-offence.org/pdfs/1.pdf) from the UK. The one-year proven re-offending rate was 56% for community orders, 63% for &lt;12 month sentences, 54% for suspended sentences, 51% for 1-4 year sentences, 40% for fines, 35% for conditional discharges.

So it's all a bit of a mess from that. It's also merely correlative; the papers note that those given &lt;12 month prison sentences got no post-release support, unlike those given &gt;12 month sentences. There's also a correlation between age on release and re-offending, which doesn't seem to have been considered in the study - instead they compared age on initial offending.

Looking directly at papers on recidivism and sentence length, [this paper](http://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/1903/3281/1/umi-umd-3109.pdf) from Pennsylvania found that longer sentences increased recidivism. [This meta-study](http://www.prisonpolicy.org/scans/e199912.htm) looked at fifty studies since 1958 and found that there was a slight positive correlation - with prison leading to more recidivism, and longer sentences leading to more than shorter ones. [This fact sheet](http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/fact-sheets/2013/10/08/prison-time-served-and-recidivism) references a study that found little or no evidence that longer sentences for many nonviolent offenders neither prevented crimes from being committed during those terms or reduced re-offending. [This study](http://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/research-projects-and-surveys/miscellaneous/20140527_Recidivism_2007_Crack_Cocaine_Amendment.pdf) looked at a very specific type of offence, and asked if a retroactive sentence reduction increased recidivism, and found that it didn't.

So... I'm pretty sure that I had remembered correctly. That was the research I found in a couple of minutes of Googling.

As for the rest, I'm not sure what human rights legislation has to do with anything, or if there's evidence of being afraid of litigation. Even if there has (as you claim) been a push to keep sentences shorter, that isn't reflected in the data - sentences have been getting longer, and more people are going to prison.

&gt;  But when someone tries to kill a priests family including his children and is only prevented from doing so by the timely arrival of the police yet gets barely a year per person attacked the legitimacy of the current justice system should be called into question.

null,false,Vancha,null,null,null,"1. No, this is slightly wrong. Representation is a part of democracy and voting is a method by which to be represented. Under the current system voting does not equate to representation because we're working under a majority-rules system, which isn't democratic (the so-called ""tyranny of the masses""). This is why you have the largest population (55s and over) getting all the representation and the smallest (young voters) getting basically zero, despite over half of them voting. I'd love to be heard, but the reality is that unless I vote for the party that wins my constituency, I'm not.

2. Easier for the discontent. 40% spoiling their ballots doesn't look any worse than 40% not voting. They both damage the credibility of FPTP, but it's far easier to convince people into inaction that to convince people to actively vote and spoil their ballot.

Let me make a parallel I came up with recently. I'm sure you'd agree that companies are noticeably more receptive to complaints and criticism when it starts to affect their bottom line. Getting problems addressed can be like getting blood from a stone right up until the moment it starts to damage their profits and suddenly they sit up and take notice. This is literally the dynamic that ""voting with your wallet"" refers to.

You can largely apply this to our current system. The more people vote, the larger the amount of participation, the less reason they have to change it. If you vote tory/labour, you're contributing to the status-quo. If you vote for anyone else, chances are you'll end up ignored anyway (because again, voting for anyone but the winner of your constituency equates to zero representation), but you contribute to their sales figures. They can say ""*75% of people voted this election, clearly the vast majority of people are satisfied with our product (FPTP). Why would we change the system when 3 in 4 people are happy with the way it is?*"".

Put simply, I end up being an irrelevance whether I vote or not. I'm ignored either way, but at least by not voting, I'm not helping prop up the system that doesn't represent me. Voting doesn't make it hard for them or make them listen, they'll win their seat regardless.

Work out your fixed costs, and work out a personal budget. This sub has a good FAQ on budgeting so make sure to read that. It will give far better advice than me.

Ive just moved into my own place and probably spend a lot more than I need to, but here's roughly my expenses broken down if it helps (to the best of my memory): 
Rent £300

House bills £217: council tax, electric, internet+phone, water, tv license, home insurance

Me £215: food, mobile phone, netflix, past debts (credit card and student overdraft)

Car £72: petrol (rarely use, walk to work),car tax (direct debit), AA

I then budget myself £250 per month of 'other expenses' kept in a separate current account used for nights out, car servicing, buying lunch when I'm lazy etc. I aim not to spend it all. The remainder goes to paying off past debts from a much worse budgeted time, and part towards a 'rainy day' fund which is mostly spent on car repairs. Note that while I include the minimum amount of debt repayment in my fixed costs, I always pay more. Currently have about 2 months salary saved, but working towards being debt free and having 6 months salary in the rainy day fund.

Your rent is higher than mine, and your council tax probably will be more too, but you dont have the car expenses, and if you dont have past debts, and dont need to pay for Hull's ridiculous internet prices, you might be okay. 

I'd say it is possible that you can afford it, but that all depends on you. One thing though, ALWAYS make sure your budget has room to put money away for emergencies. They always happen. And in my opinion, you should always overestimate your 'other expenses', but im terribly impulsive.

A quote from the conclusion of the study:

&gt;We are now in a position to argue a surprisingly strong case against natal astrology as practised by reputable astrologers. Great pains were taken to insure that the experiment was unbiased and to make sure that astrology was given every reasonable chance to succeed. It failed.

I can link a lot more of these studies if necessary to get my point across: **Astrology has been proven to have no statistically significant predictive or correlative power.**

The basic point, though, is that debt-to-GDP spiked massively in the aftermath of the 2007-8 financial crisis. [It doubled, roughly.](http://i.imgur.com/gp4iVkE.png)

So, yes, while there tends to be some level of deficit spending, as you can see from the Telegraph graphic, this isn't an issue as long as the economy is growing (at a faster rate), because that means that the debt-to-GDP ratio falls (as you can see from 1997-2002).

Actually it's 976 extra homeless people, but I accept that it’s okay to round such small numbers to the nearest thousand.

&gt;Ignoring that, why are you comparing the figure to the overall population anyway, I can't see how it's relevant.

I was drawing attention to the alarmist way the Mirror was reporting it. They know very well that a '50% increase' is meaningless for something like homelessness because most people don't have a good sense of how many people there actually are living rough - but 50% is clearly meant to sound like it's a BIG increase.

Homelessness isn't like the price of milk, or the number of kids in a typical classroom, or even (thanks to the media obsession with this stat) the level of net immigration, all of which many people have a good instinctive feel for even if they can't quote the exact number.

Given the lack of familiarity with the levels, a more informative way to report this would be to have said something like 'Homeless in the UK up 50% to nearly 3,000 people in 2014'. Then people would have the facts that homelessness has increased, as well as being able to judge for themselves whether or not homelessness was now a big social problem in Britain (since most people have a good sense of whether 3,000 people means it is common or exceptionally rare).

With that in mind, the most striking thing for me about this article was just how few people there are sleeping rough, even after this 50% increase. From a position of ignorance, I would easily have guessed there were 10 or 20 times that number, and I'm annoyed that the Mirror’s headline and use of language ('shocking rise', 'increased dramatically', etc) sought to draw attention away from that raw fact.",null,0,null,1425075099,null,0,false,0,cozdcgr,null,t3_2xcdo2,null,t1_cozdcgr,null,t1_coz4ty6,null,null,null,1427493522,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

* Electricity (looks like no gas?) - £60
* Water - £25
* Phone - £15
* Internet - £15
* TV licence (if you watch TV) - £12

So thats roughly £614 a month.  I've obviously had to guess at figures for electricity and water but I did look up the council tax.  Council tax is paid over 10 months rather than 12, so there would be 2 months you wouldn't be paying that.

The place is unfurnished, so you would need to get hold of at least basic furniture.  Plus it doesn't look like there are white goods (cooker, washing machine, fridge etc.).

Most councils seem to split the yearly charge over 10 monthly payments. You can get a discount if you are the sole occupier. You're probably looking at &lt;£100 for a small flat.

Gas &amp; Electric: Somewhere in the region of £50 to £100 a month, depending on how frugal you are. I live in a 1 bedroom flat in Berkshire surrounded on both sides and above and below and have not had my heating on at all all winter, but I do work from home on my computer all day every day. So my gas use is low, but my electric use is high. My combined bill is ~£80 a month.

Water: This will really depend on if you are in a metered area (where you pay for everything you use) or a single payment area (where you just pay a flat fee). I think it tends to average out at between £15-£30 a month.

Groceries: A single person can easily live on £200 a month, including general supermarket purchases such as cleaning supplies, toiletries etc. You can go really cheap with food and maybe drop that closer to £100 if you really want to cut back.

TV/Internet/Landline: Any package you get will tend to require a phone line rental of approximately £15pm, so that is basically your base price. You might get the line rental discounted as part of a package. My BT fibre/basic TV/phone line package is currently £36 a month including various discounts that I got when signing up. That will go up once the discounts come to an end. You can go really basic for less than that.

Those are your basic utilities.

You'll also have your personal stuff such as contents insurance (~£10 per month), car costs, mobile and you also need to factor in ""entertainment"" costs, such as going out for meals, cinema, clubs and pubs etc but only you'll realistically know what that's going to add up to.

You will also need to buy all your own furniture. You can get stuff for cheap off ebay or gumtree, but it all adds up. Looking at your linked property in particular, the description mentions a modern fitted kitchen, but the photos seem to suggest a severe lack of white goods - the fridge/freeze, oven and washing machine. It is incredibly unusual for rented accommodation to not include those as standard, even if it comes completely unfurnished.

You're not making much sense here. 

It absolutely is possible to run a perpetual deficit, as long as the economy grows at a rate faster than the deficit and the costs of financing it. 

More strictly speaking, in the case of national economies, what do you think is going to happen, exactly? Do you think people will stop lending money to the UK government? Really? 

If the UK wanted, it could keep ""spending beyond its means"" for a long, long time and then just default or inflate the debt away. Argentina defaulted not too long ago and it still has people lending to it. Germany is no stranger to inflating its way out of debt.

Lib dems did well out of being Anti-Iraq, VERY WELL, but the only reason they are not at 100 odd seats is F2P, liberalism *is* popular, the modern new cycle with them as pariahs doesn't change this, only obscure it.

On the other hand..

UKIP might do pretty well in may, but whilst they have the funding they only exist so long as their is not or has not been a EU referendum. Then they eat themselves (they have a roughly coherent Libertarian ex-conservative party core, surrounded by utter fucking lunatics). 

The Greens have no big funding and are barely coherent enough to hold any seats for more than a term once people start to seriously go for them. Even then, appeal outside of Uni seats is nil. Only seriously non enviromentalist party outside of N.I is UKIP, their attempt to distguish themselves as 'green' either runs into some napkin economics democratic socailism or just luddism that devolves into anti-scentific nonsense quickly and the tide is turning on things like GM, possibly nuclear also soon.

Only populists with any staying power is the SNP, though they decied to hitch themselves to north sea oil a while back and whilst they are going to give Labour a hilarious hiding to the tune of 20-40 seats. Scot's allways vote with their wallet on the whole and economic history is going in only one direction, SNP's history so far on a post oil economy is seriously fucking bad, look how many renewable projects they have banjaxed. Source: am Scot. 

Will the Liberal Democrats, to survive as a party though *as is*, thats going to be hard to call - don't forget we are looking at a historic low of catty infighting during their time in government. Have a suspicion the social democrats and classical liberals will be attacking each other post election day. I've put a fair bit of effort into them IRL and I don't think anyones doubting that most if not all university seats might be lost and thats likely down 15-30 seats.

Hypothetical:
C:  The baby stuck his finger in a light socket and electrocuted himself.

C:  I never said that.  The babysitter knew about the empty light socket.
L:  So you’re saying the babysitter is to blame!
C:  I never said that.  The babysitter asked the mom before she left about the empty light socket and she said it was not connected, so “no worries.”
L:  Ah ha!  The mom is to blame because she was wrong!
C: Chill out.  There was no power to the light socket for many years but the estranged dad came over last night and fixed it as a birthday present to the mom.
L: Well then the dad is at fault!
C: No, he left a note but had no access to the house.
L:  God damn it – then who’s at fault?
C: What is your fixation with blame?  Why can we not gather the facts first?
L:  I know what you’re really saying – you’re one of those people.
C:  Huh?
L:  Both the mom and dad are to blame!
C:  Actually, we just found the baby monitor video showing the baby’s brother encouraging the baby to put his finger in the light socket.
L:  You didn’t mention that – then it’s the brother’s fault!!
C: The brother is three years old.
L: You’re so annoying (blaming others for his constantly jumping to unwarranted conclusions based on an eighth grade understanding of logic).

Moreover, your ignorance and black-white mindset contribute to the world’s problems because you fail to comprehend cause and effect, instead actively choosing a knee-jerk, uninformed conclusion of who’s “at fault.”  And no, neither ""push"" nor ""stressor"" implies fault.

They seem to have done a okish job as painting themselves as a general human rights organisation until this point. But they have made some pretty *problematic* statements about Islamism in the past.

They really, really jumped the shark in the last couple of days though. 

Yes the security boys and girls being occasionally draconian as fuck is no doubt horrific to experience. But in this case, they appear to have got it right and got it right appropriately. This guy really was out there actively trying to sign up for quite some time and appear to have only had him on the radar either shortly before or after this became a serious thing. 

In short, even if you have pictures of Snowden up on the wall, someone actively trying to go to places to link up with violent Islamist Millita's... probably is a person to keep an eye on and occasionally interrogate.

And the idea that MI5 going all guantamo on him, sets a reasonable context for murdering in cold blood journo's and fucking aid workers.

That much has been evident for a while.  We're actually very lucky Kane has had the breakthrough season he's had.  He should've shifted Bobby and Ade in either of the last two transfer windows and poured the money into two new strikers.

I agree with Studge being not effective. You would not have bet against him scoring that chance Balo put on a silver platter for him. I think he is  just  overthinking it.

&gt; Sterling, is the more curious one to me because I couldn't quite put my finger on it but I thought he struggled to find space and when he did link up to great effectiveness, especially thought he should have played better off of Balo's great hold up play.

I think Sterling was too isolated. Studge and Balo are too far up, Allen too far back, and Can was trying to connect the dots (and not succeeding very well). Our usual formation it might have worked if Ibe and Moreno comes in the MF more, but they are clearly ordered to ""stay behind the ball"" -- you can see all game they had too much space to cover to get behind their FB. 

&gt;With that set-up when we regain possession it should become a 3-5-2, with our wing backs able to combine with the central players and make darting overlapping runs and diagonals to suck the defense out of position while opening up our creative 3 up top. 

I think that's the *idea*, but I don't think it work. As I said, the FB are too deep, and we only have sterling covering the entier #10 area. If we have 2 #10s like we normally do, they can split the space between them -- 2 players is not just ""an extra player"", it's half the *space* they have to cover each.

I personally think Hendo would have struggled even in Can's position. He is trying to do too much. He gets pulled forward when we are attacking, and then dragged back when we are defending.  YOu can see Lallana suffering from the same problem when he comes in too. Allen's area is being overloaded, and CM are being drawn back to help him cover. If Can is playing CB, he often steps up to help out that area, but our 3CB are holding too deep a line because all 3 are not the ""front foot defenders"" type. Lovren is suppose to be the guy carrying the ball out (we can see he can do it in Soton), but he is too short of confidence at the moment to play pretty footie -- he did his Skrtel-type CB duties well though.

Anyhow, i agree with you that Balo off is a mistake. He should have stayed on, not just because he is playing better but also because he can take a PK. It's clear that we are going for PK during extra-time : we are totally spent. 

Anyhow, thanks for the answer again. We don't have to agree, but it's better than ""can is shit"" ""allen is great"" +1 +1  -1 -1 we get here :)
