I could support those things, but I can be perfectly consistent in thought while rejecting any or all of them. It is quite simple to reject paedophilic marriages as lacking in the mutually consenting adults thing. It is moronic to believe that anyone who supports gay marriage has to support that too. I doubt you believe it, which means your reasons for claiming it are more nefarious. Cut the crap.

Similarly, incestual marriages can be rejected on grounds of the medical problems, as well as on grounds that there cannot be the normal kind of mutual consent between people that are in a family like that.

I don't mind support marriages larger than two, if everyone consents, but I don't doubt that others may reject it with perfectly valid reasoning.

My two cents on the whole thing for what they're worth:

I think last season really did take a major toll on him and changed his plans a lot. From the way the title was lost (obviously we know the slip was just one incident in a myriad that ended with us in second place but damn it if the entire world doesn't want to try and break him by constantly pinning it on him alone) and the debacle of the World Cup campaign, Steven Gerrard is a different man this year. 

He seems beleaguered and beaten down. It's heartbreaking to see. Because while he may not seem so to us, he is human after all and no human should have to endure what he has since April of last year. Endless taunts and scrutiny from every corner; honestly a lesser man would have had a breakdown by now. 

So I wonder if now Stevie has looked at everything and said to himself, ""Screw it, time for something new."" He's passed up on the opportunity many times before in his career to remain with *his* club, but maybe the time is finally right to have one last adventure. 

He's the reason I'm a Liverpool fan. Ever since he smashed that one in against Germany in the famous Germany 1-5 England. And it's going to feel really empty for a while when he isn't on the pitch for matches. But our Captain deserves this. He deserves to try something new because of everything he's given to us over the years.

Seriously though, I'm American, I've only been watching ""soccer"" since the 2006 World Cup, and I discovered Liverpool a couple of years later.  Gerrard was my first soccer hero, someone I really knew and watched. 

Great players come and go, they can't play on forever.  To put a positive spin on it, at least he's leaving the club in the twilight of his career, at least he didn't move on during his prime, he gave his best years to club and that's all you can really ask for.  

He will move on, the club will move on.  The way we've been playing lately (except, ironically, when Gerrard is in) the future looks bright.

I was referring to two consenting adults in a loving and serious relationship who want to solidify their commitment in marriage... They just happen to be brother and sister. Genetics aren't an issue if they choose not to have children and even if they do potential offspring can be tested for possible defects as we often do for other couples.
The reasons to allow this marriage are EXACTLY the same ones given to justify equality in gay marriage. Therefore if there is any consistency and fairness in your argument you cannot disagree with any other individuals or group if individuals who use the same reasoning as you do.
Otherwise you are advocating a system just as discriminatory as the one you wish to change. Gay marriage supporters do not want an end to discrimination they just want a form of discrimination that suits them better. 
Nothing wrong with that as long as you can admit it and not dress it up I. A cloud of smoke called equality.

And why when someone advocates a position that's the same as current public opinion are they called troll and swore at? It gets a bit old fast.

Anyway, I was having a nosy around the website and saw that Atsu, Distin and Alcaraz all have contracts that run out this year (31/5, 30/6 &amp; 30/6 respectfully).  (You can see this [here](http://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/everton-fc/kader/verein/29/saison_id/2014))

Assuming neither Distin nor Alcaraz sign new contracts, we'll be in need of a new centre back come the summer. What are your thoughts on this? Do you think, given our defensive issues, that this is something that should be looked into now during the January transfers or left until the summer? 

As for Atsu, does he realistically have a place at Everton?  
Personally, I don't think so but he is young and he is incredibly fast.  

Also, I totally didn't realise that McGeady is 28!! I thought he was way younger. He's the same ages as Naismith, that astounds me.

This summer we lost Agger, Reina, and Suarez, who were all leaders during their time with us, and all three of them captained us before. Now we're losing the lifeblood of our club for so many years in Gerrard.

Glen Johnson's contract is expiring, and it does not appear that he is sticking around. Say what you want about his play, but he is a leader and a very experienced international player. Toure's contract is running out this summer as well. He's probably moving on.

Players that have either been linked with moves elsewhere or generally not considered good enough include Lucas, Enrique, and Brad Jones. Skrtel and Lambert only have a year left on their contracts.

Considering all of this, after this season, we find ourselves in the position of having our most senior players be Mignolet, Jones, Enrique, Lovren, Sakho, Skrtel, Henderson, Lallana, Lucas, Allen, Sturridge, Ballotelli, and Lambert. Only 7 of those have been with use for more than 1.5 years, and I'd bet money that at least 3-4 of those are leaving within the next year.

If someone attacks Sweden or Germany, then technically NATO has to get involved.

NATO *does* have nuclear weapons - from the US, UK and France. Therefore Trident is part of that.

So one could argue that the reason why Sweden has not been invaded is BECAUSE of the UK, France and the US spending money on nuclear weapons. Certainly Sweden, and the aggressor (let's be honest, it would be Russia) should expect us to use the nukes if it came to that.

The real question is whether anybody wants to rely on NATO. If we give up Trident then we mainly rely on the US and France. And I don't 100% believe that they would be willing to go to nuclear war on our behalf. 

Also, Trident is a system which will be in place until the 2040's or 2050's. We have no idea what may happen to world politics in the meanwhile. The EU might collapse, maybe even triggered by the UK leaving. France might elect a staunch anti-war leader who gives up their nukes.

Your entire line of argument is that if we hold equality as the only ideal then we must support a range of positions that you present to us. Does anyone actually hold equality as the only ideal? If not, then there is plenty of room to balance ideals in a manner that rejects these positions that you demand we hold.

Even if we did, that is no reason not to support gay marriage by itself as a matter of progress in the right direction, as a workable compromise with the rest of society. The argument is pointless, it cannot achieve your any thing that support the position I am assuming you are holding.

What benefit is that to anyone? This isn't just seizing assets. You're talking about a group of people. Almost everybody there wants to remain British. Leaving aside the moral argument of whether it is okay to disregard their wishes, how would we handle that? 

It seems rather odd to hand over a large chunk of British people - who wish to remain British, that Britain is happy to have and have historically been British for generations - to a different country.

The militarisation of a small island that was very recently invaded seems reasonable to me. As far as I know we aren't giving any indication we would ever invade Argentina. It's never been part of our political narrative. Even when you invaded us. 

&gt;I'm not saying they should be 100% argentine, but some agreement on demilitarization and at least regulation of explotation (just some enviromental security so that they don't exploit stuff irresponsibly and maybe some taxes because the resources are so close to us) 

What exploitation? You want to tax the Falklands on the premise of proximity? Can we suggest the same too then? Argentina is awfully close to our island. Demilitarise please because it is rude. Then we want some taxes.

My own view is this - there is nothing colonial about Britain's rule over the Falkland Islands. The people there want to remain an overseas territory. We're not militarily occupying and forcing our rule on native people, we're there because they want us there. 

Argentina's approach to the Falklands *is* colonial. Argentina wants to take land from people who have been living on that land for &gt;100 years because that land happens to be closer to Beunos Aires then to London, and either forcefully rule over people who do not want to be Argentine citizens or more likely evict the 'colonists'. If that's not imperialistic, I don't know what is.

Ultimately historical empires and who planted their flag on a bit of land first are pretty poor reasons to claim some territory as being yours. Especially when that territory is inhabited.

I don't know how many papers I wrote about him for English creative writing where you write about your hero, all I know is that I wrote about him every time up until about 15.

In those 5 games I wished for a Stevie goal just so I could witness something so special in real life... On two occasions it happened, this year against Sunderland he scored a free kick and I was in tears before he hit it feeling that my whole life has led me to witness this moment, it was so special I wish I could could put into words how I felt. The other one was a few weeks back against Basel, it was everything I wished could happen like back in 05 but the night wasn't to be, even though after I seen he scored I didn't even care as much about the result because I felt like I lived my dream. I know people say football is just a game but this man was my childhood and as far as I can remember he was a Liverpool player so seeing him go now at the end of the season will obviously be the end of an era, but for most younger fans and some older ones it'll just feel like the club will never be the same without him.

Shaqiri for Switzerland, where he has the confidence of the manager and knows he's one of the top guys, is a very different beast from Shaqiri for Bayern, where his chances are limited and he probably feels way too over eager to prove himself.  His biggest criticism at Bayern is decision making, which is something he can get wrong all the time if he's putting himself under a lot of mental pressure to make the huge plays and try to force himself a chance to prove himself.

The vitriol and ridicule coming from Europeans/MC fans in these threads is absolutely amazing.

This is about being able to trust the corporate entity that's controlling your club (an entity we're all forced to accept because none of us can afford our own personal MLS club).

We, as a supporter base, have been directly lied to and it's the ownership -- the people who collect and reallocate our money -- at fault.

Neither one is about to take a regular spot from Schweinsteiger, Javi Martinez, Lahm, Thiago, or Xabi Alonso when they're fit (obviously they'll get time when players need to be rested though).  They're amazing young talents but they're currently prospering from Bayern's injury problems more than anything.

He's definitely a gamble, I agree.  So were Sturridge and Coutinho, who were the last pair of talented rejects we brought in (aside from Balotelli but he's just a weird signing all around, he has none of the qualities we should've been looking for) and they've come good in an environment where they know they've got the backing of the manager.  A lot of the things people criticize Shaqiri for are the same sorts of things that were said about Sturridge and sometimes Coutinho.

You know, that's actually one thing I love about football.  Because American Football has a draft, it's extremely rare the hometown kid gets to become a hometown hero.  There's EIGHT starting QBs from Texas in the NFL this year, and yet, the Houston Texans had trouble finding a QB and ended up starting a undrafted guy from the University of Houston the final two games (he won by the way, that's about as close to Hometown Hero you get in the NFL).  BTW... I really hope they end up sticking with this guy actually.  

I can actually only think of a couple of examples, Clyde Drexler.  A basketball player, he was born and raised in Houston, played at the University of Houston, although he originally played for Portland in the NBA, later in his career he signed on with the Houston Rockets and won an NBA title with them.

Complete rubbish. First off, Argentine military is pretty much the exact same military that we fought in 1982 but with even less funding. The hardware is almost exactly the same. Recently one of their ships sank in port... They don't have the ability to launch and invasion like last time. 

Also, we had ~50 military personnel on the island when we were invaded last time. Now we have ~1,500. Along with a new military base, anti air and 4 typhoons. 

We don't need to retake it because Argentina doesn't have a chance of taking it in the first place. At the first sign of trouble the base can be regarrisioned in under 48 hours by air.. That's by design.

This is one factor to consider.  The other factor is that thought the Falkland Isles the UK has a huge claim to a massive chunk of the Antarctic, it's been a while since I've needed to study the area but I believe it's close to a quarter of the continent. If the UK was to lose control of the Falklands it will lose the ""currently"" hidden riches and resources around the isles and also it's claim to the Antarctic region.

The reason that military base is there is because of the 1982 invasion by Argentina and the continued belligerent position of the Argentine government towards the people of the Falklands.  Before the invasion the garrison was less than 100 soldiers which should of been an appropriate amount. Personally I think it was considerably more ""rude"" of Argentina to attempt to annex a British sovereign territory by military force against the will of the residents of the islands. 

While there are many arguments that can be made about who should own the islands the simple facts are that within living memory 250+ British military personnel lost their lives defending the islands from an unprovoked invasion and that 1,513 out of the 1,517 (99.7%) British citizens who voted in the 2013 referendum do not want to join Argentina (or anyone else).

I have a funny feeling that Martinez has set out to win the Europa and get CL spot that way instead of the conventional route. It's fine and dandy if you can get a top 8 finish to go along with it. What good is the CL spot if we drop to the Championship and have to sell all the players we have?


This squad has serious motivational issues starting with Lukaku. I love Lukaku and I was ecstatic when we signed him. He bitches too much and we can all see he's not chasing down the ball. Him throwing his hands up in frustration is a familiar picture that we have been seeing way too often. 


Barry has been pretty shocking lately and there isn't anyone to replace him. I would go with Besic and McCarthy when James is back.

There's still 19 more games left in the season and there will more twists. It's extremely unlikely that there will be no ups and downs over the course of the rest of the season.

However, I still think there are valid complaints we have to acknowledge and can't pretend that losing 5-3 is no big deal and just a random blunder. Ivanovic pushing ahead resulting in counters with only 3 defenders back and goals conceded has been happening since the beginning. Cahill also has many a ton of mistakes, probably due to Ivanovic going ahead. Willian isn't contributing to the offense despite his work rate and effort. We need Schurrle to get his form back because I think he's crucial for us. Right now, there's no threat from the right side and that may be a partial reason Ivanovic does go ahead so often.

Hopefully Jose makes some changes. Personally I'd like to see some of these things: Let Schurrle get a decent run of games to get his form back. Drop Cahill for a bit and give somebody else a chance. Either drop Ivanovic for Dave (and then obviously putting Luis at LB), put him at CB or instruct him to stay back a lot more/not commit as much.

Everton was founded in 1878 , and is one of the oldest clubs in the world, being one of the original founders of England's first football league. Since that time, we have spent only 3 seasons in the second division, and are always a top flight presence. One of the best players in England, Dixie Dean, played for us during the 20's and 30's, setting a record of 60 goals in one season, which has yet to be broken. We have won 9 league championships and 5 FA Cups, making us one of the most successful clubs. Our most hated rivals are the red shite, Liverpool FC (Where you never wank alone). The bastards have had more success than us in almost all facets of the game (damn Philistines) but we always give them a run for their money in the derby (see Jagielka's thunderbastard that made Mignolet and all of Anfield shit themselves). Overall, everton is a medium sized club that doesn't have neatly the same funds as Chelsea, Man U, Man City, or Arsenal.

&gt; First goal from Kane was running towards the right and cutting his shot across to the left. It's one of the hardest shots to save as a keeper, especially when it's hit with that much power.

&gt;Second goal he comes out, makes himself big and forces the shot wide. Hits the post and poor defending from Cahill allows Rose to score the rebound.

&gt;Third goal was from the penalty spot, it's a 50/50. He even dives the right way but couldn't keep it out.

&gt;Fourth goal was poor defending from Ivan, Cahill and perhaps more importantly Terry as he turns his back to Kane rather than making himself big and getting a foot in. Kane's shot rebounds off Terry's open legs and sails past Courtois who would have otherwise saved it.

&gt;Fifth goal, exact same thing happens as with the fourth goal. Literally the same thing, go ahead and watch it again. Rebound off Terry's leg and it sends Courtois the wrong way.

You're also seeming to ignore that De Gea gave up 4 goals to MK Dons and 5 to Leicester. This was one of those games were there are tons of goals conceded, but that doesn't mean it's all on the keeper.

And its not only the sporting game. Just a few games ago he started against I forgot what team and he was terrible. Even in the match thread people were saying he should be taken off. I can't be bothered to check which game it was because I'm on my phone but I think it was Newcastle. 

Everything doesn't work like the way you're putting on paper. There's so many other factors to take in, like set pieces, the opposition etc..  I'm not saying bran is perfect, he's far from it. 

Bran is having problems but he's not as much an issue as Cahill and our right wing. The way you're talking like

&gt; Azpi on to his weaker side and it is **extremely** clear that Luis should be LB with Dave at RB.

Its as if we have the perfect answer right on our bench but it's not, and there's a reason isn't playing ahead of bran.

We need a faster Centre-Back if we are going to persist with a higher line of defence with full-backs bombing forward. If we dont address the problem now we risk a repeat of losing or drawing important fixtures.
Failure is not a problem. How you deal with it is a problem. If you dont deal with it it'll spread like a disease. No-one addresses a problem like Jose can. Keep faith. Shit Happens.

What?? I am not doing anything close to that. I am as honest as they come, I even admitted that Ivanovic is the more stronger and skillful defender.. My problems with Ivanovic is that he just disappears and gets lost up the field leaving our defense open, he has done this countless times, season after season, and **again** just today. It doesn't matter if you are the best tackler in the world, if you act like a striker and stay on the wrong half of the field you are near useless.

It's time. He is done improving as a player and apparently doesn't feel comfortable ending his career coming off the bench. If he ever owed the club or city anything, that debt's long been paid. He has the total right to decide how he wants his career to end. 

And now, Rodgers can concentrate on putting out the best starting XI without worrying about offending any sensibilities. By announcing his leaving, I think Gerrard's performed one last service for his club by allowing it to rebuild, whatever that takes. 

I'm grateful I got to see him play live in the US last year. As for where Gerrard should go next, Chicago Man in Red, please.

Out of all the games he had 2 maybe 3 decent games. Don't you get it? If he is that much of a better choice as you say, then he'd be starting over bran. He's been given plenty of chances to prove himself and he hasn't proven anything more than being a sub. Bran has weaknesses but so does Luis.

Honestly, I'm not saying bran is good enough, he's definitely a problem, the part I am disagreeing with is Luis being the answer. Ugh I hope Luis proves himself and up his game soon because like you I don't think bran will get his shit together soon enough if we want trophies.

null,false,Antsonfire,num18,,null,"Yeah, he throws out some crazy teams that make no sense, like putting Jordan Henderson at wingback. He's defensively strong, but the problem there is that he's not really a wide man. A cool thing I've noticed is that he never plays the same formation against opposition- so if we're playing a five man midfield with the 4-2-3-1, he'll try to overrun it with a two striker system. 

I do have to say that he has the defensive organization of a fridge box fort. Lovren probably would've been fine for us, but under Rodgers, he looks terrible. Maybe it comes down to Poch being a former player (specifically a defender) in top flights and Rodgers not really having that to go by. 

I'll say that Poch is rigid, but deciding where to put some players (Dembele on for one of Lamela or Eriksen I think earlier, Paulinho in that attacking mid position, Harry in Chadli's and so on) is experimentation in itself. That, or the Soldado experiment was a failed one and we had five undroppable players for the front four early on in the season. 

I wonder if Danny Ings can make a successful transition into the wide forward role that Poch likes. I like that he's faster than my other big preference (Austin), so it'd be logical to try him out there. If not, Eriksen hasn't played too badly on the left and with a defensive minded fullback like Davies to cover for him, playing the second striker role while being in the hole would be fun to watch.

It's just using the plane ticket model on trains, but the difference is that trains are (or at least should be) for daily use, whereas flying is a fairly irregular occurrence. The advance ticket model makes tickets cheaper for those who use the train irregularly, but more expensive for people who use it daily. It should be the complete opposite ffs.

And yes, I know season tickets exist, but they're barely any different to the usual cost.

For example, there's a season ticket mentioned on the BBC today - £4888 for a season ticket between Milton Keynes and London.

I do actually quite like Eriksen on the left in our current system, and you can argue that his best games last season for us were on the left under Sherwood.  He will always come inside, but with a true fullback supporting him, he can overload the middle of the pitch and find a bit more space instead of just being crowded out by one or two CDMs.

Still, I do think you always want your best player in the position where they can cause the most damage, and I think the middle of the park is his place of greatest influence for most opponents.

It has to be remembered, that we didn't want to fight, and also that we could easily have destroyed the entire country, laid waste to it's capital, quite safely, from a few hundred miles at sea.  But we didn't, we have never shown any interest in being an aggressor to Argentina.

We can't possibly allow demilitarisation of The Falklands purely because of all the posturing, if a country, which has tried to take them by force in recent memory, still has signs up claiming ownership of them, whilst the people who've lived there for generations, democratically self determine that they are not owned by Argentina.",null,0,null,1420189474,null,0,false,0,cnc0m4m,null,t3_2r216c,null,t1_cnc0m4m,null,t1_cnbz8hp,null,null,null,1425103069,null,23,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,23,null

null,false,RedofPaw,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,null,"Of course it does! That's what all this is about, isn't it. Argentina saying these islands, inhabited for two centuries are theirs and trying to take them by force or arguing the Falklands should be given over to them without force.

However the history of the Islands is FAR from that clear cut, and Britain had military outposts there before Argentina even existed. Indeed an English captain was the first to land there in 1690. 

French and British outposts were the first inhabitants there, way before Argentina even existed and the only time Argentina held control of the islands was for a decade and a half before they lost control of their own people there.

So, by what measure does Argentina hold any right to 'take back' the islands?

The first landing was English, and it was held by Britain and France before Argentina, so it's not about who was there first. Time of occupancy? Argentina had around 16 years of occupancy, while Britain is around 2 centuries. So... I guess it's not that.

You repeat and repeat and restate that the territory is Argentina's and yet:

&gt;According to the law 23968, the territorial waters of Argentina extend 12 nautical miles from the line from the goulfs of San Matías and San Jorge to the outer limits of the Río de la Plata. The contiguous zone extends 12 nautical miles after the territorial waters, and the exclusive economic zone 200 nautical miles from it. The continental shelf extends to either the limits of the exclusive economic zone or the shelf slope. Argentina has signed and ratified the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.

In international law the islands do NOT fall under the territory. Indeed they are 100 miles outside that range at 300 miles off the coast. 

Any dispute would be over over-lapping territories, and indeed Britain and Argentina held joint fishing rights, until Argentina pulled out of that to be more aggressive (and eventually start a war killing thousands). 

What else is there? You objected to Britain being so far away from the Falklands compared to how close Argentina is, yet there is no legal basis for how far the sovereign entity in control of a land must be.

To be honest I can't really see by what argument you or Argentina believe they have legitimate claim. 

Meanwhile you hope to open new talks about the future between the Falklands and Argentina. If so, then I probably wouldn't lead with: 

&gt;it's not ""take"" but ""get back"" in a sense.

Because then some might feel Argentina is continuing with it's aggressive desire to colonise the Islands and start a new war.",null,0,null,1420191235,null,0,false,0,cnc10yk,null,t3_2r216c,null,t1_cnc10yk,null,t1_cnbz9bn,null,null,null,1425102875,null,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13,null

As long as that American doesn't make money from anything but normal wage income, that's correct.

I see lots of arguments that the people on the islands want to remain British. Of course they do, the British planted people on the islands, something that have done countless times in history. A British tactic would be to 'cull' the native population in the area they wanted control over, either through starvation or slavery or in the case of Las Malvinas which wasn't really populated they waited for the Spanish to leave entirely then they struck. Argentina itself was briefly on the islands - the British decided to show their might after the Spanish granted independence. The British had previously, and there is no denying it, agreed with Spain that it would not colonise in this region.

Las Malvinas are thousands of miles away from Britain as you pointed out in your OP. As you stated in your OP there is indeed a colonial legacy with the notion of 'The Falklands' - the very existence of this entity is colonial. 

For instance say Argentina had control of the Isle of Man, you can just imagine the uproar, warmongering and anti-Argentian rhetoric that would follow.

At the end of the day no one should be surprised that the British took control of Las Malvinas. They also took a very small islet named Rockall and to show that it belonged to them they sent SAS troops to it to make a claim over it despite the fact many other countries lay claim to it. The arguments for Las Malvinas to remain under British occupation are contradictory, it is okay to respect the so-called right to determination of the people on the island as long as it is under British control however should the said contested zone not be under British rule or want to break away from British rule then the democratic right to determination is revoked or ignored as history shows us.

Argentina has never stated they would force these individuals to leave should the islands be liberated and returned. If the islands were to be unshackled the planters ('islanders') would have to live under Argentinean rule. I understand your point that they should have their opinion taken into account but why should Argentina make concessions with a set of people who are illegally occupying the islands.

As history has shown us there is little hope in 'peace' ever being achieved with Britain unless you bend on one knee and do what they dictate. I believe the only way forward for Argentina is to launch military action to liberate the islands. It would be best if all 'South American' countries to placed an embargo on Britain.

We didn't have a damp or mould problem, but things were falling apart. There was a sycamore tree growing in the drain on the other side of the kitchen sink - we requested every time we went to Uni Housing that they do something about it before it gets too big and takes down the wall. They never did anything. It was big enough when we left to have healthy foliage saying hello at the kitchen window. AFAIK it's still there. Showers would break regularly, and over one Christmas the valve to the water tank burst and flooded the hall and kitchen. Said valve was shoddily installed and wasn't the right one for the job, and all Housing did was rent us some 50-year-old dehumidifiers and expected us to clean it up. When it became apparent the carpets were ruined, they wanted to only pay for new underlay but the carpet fitter installed a complete fresh one and billed them because the carpet was actually rotting.

&gt;Can I ask what experience you have that enables you to dismiss any semblance of self-determination or responsibility and instead blame anyone else?

Who's dismissing personal responsibility? The class and wealth you're born into has much more to do with how much wealth you live and die with than hard work or whatever. People can expect personal responsibility for personal decisions. But there are societal and structural problems which it would would be insane to blame these blokes at the factory for.

null,false,ClownGnomes,null,null,null,"I'm not very experienced with investing, but I've been using Nutmeg since May 2013, with one ""fund"" set to risk level 7. I've managed to decrease my fee level to 0.9%. The returns since I started are listed as 5.2% on the dashboard, but this seems to be calculated as the all-time gains after fees over total amount paid in to the account. So that figure is useless for determining the performance of their investments, as I started the account with the minimum investment of £1000 and have significantly increased it with monthly contributions. I guess performance without adding contributions would be closer to twice that figure.

Most of it is invested in Vanguard/iShares ETFs, either in FTSE, S&amp;P, UK Gilts and UK Corporate Bonds. From what I've understood, the risk level setting seems to mostly tweak the balance between the first two and the last two. 

Then there's a bunch of small investments all over the world, each one a single-figure percent of my portfolio. I guess this bit is their secret sauce. I say secret... I know how much of each I own, and there's a list of all the funds they use right here, for anyone to see: http://www.nutmeg.com/how-we-invest/our-investments

But to be honest I find my portfolio only performs a little bit better than plain old FTSE (in fact you can see that fact on their own website in the graph here: http://www.nutmeg.com/how-we-invest#our-approach). 

Still, overall I'm happy with it. I love being able to see how many shares of each ETF I ""own"" and each purchase and sale transaction. In fact it is so transparent with what its doing, someone could open an account with a few grand and copy all the investments nutmeg does. But I have no idea how much that would cost in fees, or how much work would be involved. Part of the advantage of Nutmeg is how bloody effortless everything is. Once you set up a standing order there really is literally nothing you need to do.

I reckon I will stick with it for a while longer. I may move to just buying ETFs myself to save on fees, and because I wouldn't mind being more involved and having some experience buying my own ETFs. But at the moment they are offering me good value for money at my current investment balance. Also there's good value added through the user interface (with fund projections, etc), their handing of all things ISA, and the monthly investment strategy email updates, which I always read.

EDIT: Actually, you can read their monthly investment strategy updates online, here's December's one: http://www.nutmeg.com/nutmegonomics/2014/12/04/markets-buoyant-despite-energy-lows-investment-strategy-update-december/",null,0,null,1420195149,null,0,1420195546,0,cnc1uzo,null,t3_2r1w54,null,t1_cnc1uzo,null,t3_2r1w54,null,null,null,1425102486,null,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1,null

Best you'll get is probably around 3% on a santander current account (I read somewhere they don't allow students to use their 123 account, so may need more research) if you're willing to take more risk - much higher (I'd advise against this as you'll just owe even more if it goes tits up). There's a student loan rate calculator [here](http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/students/student-finance-calculator). 

According to this in 3 years you'll owe £31,790. With santander you'll make about £40 in interest a month - an optimistic (very optimistic, this assumes santander has 20k to begin with) £1440 after your degree finishes. Total saving would be 24,600+£1440=£26,040 - you'd then have to pay back the £31,790 making you -£5760 in dept (my numbers maybe way off here, so apologies if this is wrong). Hopefully you see the issue now :)

I'd really advise against any loans - the money isn't yours to begin with; just costs you more in the long run with very few exceptions. That being said if I was forced to play a hand I'd go with santander for this kind of thing, guaranteed the money instantly and you aren't tied in - the only downside is the 20k limit on the 3%. A cash ISA is a crap option, the interest rates are too shit to make it worth the effort; they're great if you've been using ISAS for years and have compounded interest or pay 40% tax; otherwise - go with santanders current account.",null,0,null,1420195438,null,0,false,0,cnc1wzk,null,t3_2qzh0q,null,t1_cnc1wzk,null,t3_2qzh0q,null,null,null,1425102460,null,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1,null

However, the point is this: There has (even admittedly) been a campaign to dig up dirt on UKIP. This campaign became unfair when it started holding UKIP to a higher standard than the rest of the parties. Specifically when it criticised defectors into UKIP for things they did whilst at other parties ONLY when they defected to UKIP.

Your source is a touch biased given the about section states:

It would be far better if you posted more neutral sources or even sources from UKIP itself when making claims about what they want.

UKIP have similarities with the Tories in that they wish for a smaller state, this again is the opposite of Fascism which raises the power of the state over all. A great irony in that you would like to increase the power of the state to pay for public services while increasing taxation while claiming that it is those who wish to decrease the size of the state that are the Fascists.

Digging into their allocations a bit more, I think I've made the mistake in assuming nutmegs more adventurous portfolios (9-10) are equivalent to my current providers offerings (which range from 1-6). 

But my 6 is heavily invested in special situations and emerging markets, whereas even the riskiest portfolio on nutmeg is still quite tame by comparison (being almost 50% comprised of S&amp;P 500 and FTSE 100). I suspect nutmeg isnt what I'm looking for after all, although I do like the look of the platform.

I think I'll probably still dump a lump sum into nutmeg and an identical amount into a new account with my current provider, and just see how they compare over 18/24 months. 
It may be that nutmegs reduced fees will be enough to make it attractive to migrate my whole portfolio over 

If all else fails, maybe I can leverage nutmeg to try and negotiate a lower rate with my provider :)

&gt; I may move to just buying ETFs myself to save on fees, and because I wouldn't mind being more involved and having some experience buying my own ETFs

It would be interesting to see if you can match nutmeg. I think their collective purchasing power would allow them to trade these funds at volumes and commissions us private investors just cant get access to. Don't forget regular rebalancing would be a big part of it too

In some ways I'd like to take a more hands on approach myself, but for my ISA and pension it feels like it wouldn't take much to make one or two stupid decisions and really screw myself.

Not true.

You get £300 expenses a day for showing up at the House **if you're a parliamentary peer**; in a new hereditary peerage, unless they also have a life peerage or are elected, they aren't able to get this.

And yes, we should pay a wage to parliamentary peers and have them on the same expenses system as the Commons, but that costs a lot more than the current arrangements…

&gt; &gt; You have to go and have custom made your ducal robes and coronet for the State Opening of Parliament[2] which will cost you about GB£30k and only be useful to you when HMTQ dies.
&gt; 
&gt; The coronation robes are different to the parliamentary robes. You can hire /borrow the parliamentary robes (or not show for the opening, other than your first time) assuming there are some spare ones for your rank.

Indeed, I meant coronation here, good point (as can be seen from the rest of my sentence ;-)).

&gt; If you can't hire some coronation robes and a coronet then you can't attend the coronation, but is that such a big deal?

Basically, the article is pretty misleading because it implies that they fudged their survey questions so that anyone who acknowledged that humans have made any contribution to global warming at all were categorised as endorsing it, which looking at their paper seems to be factually incorrect.

Spot on. Something that hasn't really been addressed by fans who are flirting with the idea of sacking Martinez, who can replace him? Lennon? McLaren? Warnock? No thanks.

We're going through a dreadful run of form, but there's plenty of time to change that. Nobody could have predicted the dip that Distin and Jagielka's form would take, never mind Stones' (amongst many others) awful luck with injures. 

There's a host of reasons why things aren't clicking at the minute, but hopefully, the rumours that Bobby has lost the dressing room are nonsense. Starting from the back, I'd say we need new blood, a fairly young centre half with plenty of fight to compliment Stones. I couldn't give a fuck if he leathers it out constantly, let Stones play it out, we just need someone who's going to bully strikers and get stuck in. Our defensive problems go beyond dead wood in the team though. Defensively, Martinez needs help, and we need to get back to basics (like clearing set pieces as opposed to trying to play it out through three/four/five opposition players).",null,0,null,1420198571,null,0,false,0,cnc2irk,null,t3_2r2oq7,null,t1_cnc2irk,null,t3_2r2oq7,null,null,null,1425102178,null,6,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,6,null

There is no appetite for demilitarization in the UK (this would be a vote-loser) and Argentina is in no position to force the issue. So demilitarization almost certainly won't happen. The war is within living memory and people see that Argentinian politicians are using the issue for political ends. So there's a perceived threat. Perhaps if U.S. policy shifts and considerable pressure is put on UK then the option will be seriously considered, but that seems unlikely.  

Personally I think the islands should remain British territory. I do not care much about the oil and gas. Also the Israeli government can fuck right off using the Falkland islands to try justify their settlements in the West Bank.

The NHS has been shown to provide phenomenal value for money and seems like a very good model for a healthcare system - obviously without specific details on the performance of that hospital it is hard to judge privatisation but I can understand why people are nervous about it.

I also hated the massive use of PFI under Labour which was in some cases obviously bad for the taxpayer but just a convenient way to shift debts off the books for political points - so it's not like I ""only take issue with when the conservatives do anything"".

In reality when I say that if you support gay marriage for XY&amp;Z reasons then to be consistent you must support other forms who use the same reasons what I'm actually pointing out is that failure to do so is exactly what those opposed to gay marriage are opposed to now ie the dup for instance (no I'm not init) preventing those in a close loving relationship to formalise their relationship in marriage, changing the definition and laws around marriage does set a precedent. It is not a slippery slope, it's a clear change that if operated on the basis of fairness and equality, not would but should allow all these other situations equal validity under the law and new arrangements. Is this an argument against gay marriage? Not really no BUT it is a clear indication of its consequences and some of the abusive and piecemeal responses I've received to that point demonstrate that many who are for the introduction of gay marriage are just as hypocritical and discriminatory as those the accuse of the same. There's nothing wrong with that, marriage has always been an exclusive and discriminatory institution, it's supposed to be BUT it annoys when one group sets it's self up as the righteous ones and berates the other for it's own sins.
Based in the reasons given of ""two consenting adults being in love and wanting to formalise their relationship in marriage"" there is no more inconsistency in someone saying I'm against gay marriage and another saying their against a brother and sister marrying because both groups meet the same criteria. Objecting to one, both or none doesn't make a person evil or bad, it just demonstrates that we each have our own views and the reasons for supporting those views is often inconsistent.

1) Big Conspiracy by elites. Where the vast majority either consciously or unconsciously go along with manufactured narratives about the way the world is.

2) Big Crapfest by elites. Where the vast majority either consciously or unconsciously go along with manufactured narratives about the way the world is.

Either way we are all going along with the illusion of an ordered rational world designed within political democracies to fulfill some sort of engagement with civil society, democratic mandates and long term health and prosperity for all.

What we are getting is a world full of chaos and war. Lack of environmental sustainability or legal accountability. Wars based on lies, sanctioned torture, illegal surveillance, banking corruption at the highest level on multiple fronts. None of this results in prison sentences.

Journalists are not just crap they are non-existent. The job of holding power to account is seen in the enterprise of 1 or 2 journalists and editors across a sea of media reporting soundbites from newswires.

So now we have to ask ourselves how did we get here? 

In a way it dosent matter if we believe in a conspiracy or not we know that the end results is a world empirically going to pot. On an environment, economic and armed instability front. At the same time as none of the levers to change this mess appear to be working and even more worrying and directly related to the message in the video no one is even really talking about this. The state of denial is incredible. Most young people are just trying to get on the housing and employment ladder closing their eyes and ears to the fact that they are moving inexorably to very dark times that their generation must at some point confront.

The reason I personally believe in conspiracy over stupidity is that the elites are doing so incredibly well out every stupid event. That dosent mean that i beleive every event is micromanaged. Simply that the overall arch of history is being intervened with for the benefit of vested power. A little instability here and a little political interference there. This seems more like blatancy theory than conspiracy to me. The reason most journalists go along with this is for the same reason everyone else does:

1) Less stressful to believe we live in a sustainable democracy than the rubble of one. 

2) More rewarding (career wise) to echo the manufactured 'middle road' view of the world than place yourself as a dissenter.

3) Those that we read in our papers or see on our screens have been selected for their (in the main unknowing) lack of integrity or ability.

4) Arrogance: Related to point 1 - we like to think we are worldly and wise and know a bit about what's going on and why. If everything we think we know about world events is debased and hollow we are just another one of the ignorant masses. Obviously this criticism can be leveled at both Journalists that maintain the sophistry of the accepted to view of how the world works and conspiracy theorists who think they know what's really going on.

In 1833 as you say, Spain attempts to give the islands to Argentina, who started a tiny settlement which didn't last very long before Britain came back to reassert our claim over the island.

Like, politicians on the whole are not mavericks. They pretty much just toe the line and do whatever has been agreed.

Secondly, it's not clear why, if sometimes reports get fucked with in one direction and sometimes they get fucked with in another direction, the result is a ~98% consensus and yet where governments have been caught red-handed tampering with reports, they always seem to go against that consensus, not in favour of it. The only realistic explanation for this is that there genuinely is just overwhelming agreement by climate scientists on the issue.

Thirdly, I think it would probably be fairer to say that whichever way it swings is the most profitable *electorally*.

[Basing it off this discussion from 2012](http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/factcheck-are-the-train-operators-the-villains-of-the-piece/11169) and specifically this section:

&gt;According to the ROSCOs’ latest annual reports, profit margins in this sector far oustrip those enjoyed by the train operators. Gross profits across the three major players totalled £350m in 2011, up from £247m in 2010.

&gt;Net profits across the three leasing companies have tended to come in at around 10 per cent of revenue over the last two years on average and some individual profit margins are eye-watering.

&gt;Angel Trains Ltd declared a profit of £123.5m in 2011 out of £341.7m revenue. In 2010 the ratio was even higher: £194m total revenue and more than half of that – £112.2m – profit.

Should we disband ROSCOs and move rolling stock leasing over to an industry-backed body who can leverage purchasing economies of scale by bulk buying for all franchises and then leasing them out? It seems like an easy win in terms of bringing down prices and delivering value for money.

The only reason I can see that it hasn't been done already is because, as usual, banks and private equity are involved and making a tidy profit at the same time. They'll still make money from the finance arrangements necessary to purchase rolling stock, just less than ~10% revenue which is far beyond normal profits.",null,0,null,1420202280,null,0,1420203358,0,cnc39s8,null,t3_2r3d83,null,t1_cnc39s8,null,t1_cnc2xif,null,null,null,1425101829,null,24,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,24,null

Key points

- the authors of the study James Taylor cites both contacted Forbes and explicitly stated he misrepresents and misuses their work.

- James Taylor works for The Heartland Institude. They have ""form"" for these sorts of shenananigans and more axes to grind than the Dwarves in the last Hobbit movie. 

I wonder if your tactic is to try to make the rest of the world bored enough to quit in frustration because you keep quoting and requiring sources that have been demonstrably proved wrong, unreliable and downright disingenuous? Because it sure ain't dialogue discussion and skepticism.

The important thing is not the 97% consensus -- [it's what the consensus was of](http://wattsupwiththat.com/2014/07/11/the-climate-consensus-is-not-97-its-100/).  ""Are humans changing the climate?"" is something that most (non-rabid) skeptics will happily agree with.  So what difference does it make if you're showing you are in agreement with the people you say disagree with you?

&gt; I wonder if your tactic is to try to make the rest of the world bored enough to quit in frustration because you keep quoting and requiring sources that have been demonstrably proved wrong, unreliable and downright disingenuous? Because it sure ain't dialogue discussion and skepticism. 

What kind of argument is that?  I could say exactly the same to you about your ""side"".

I don't really care anyway -- I've been converted from an ""alarmist"" to a skeptic by convincing argument rather than just being shouted at.  I've done my share of arguing and discussion, and I'm tired of it, I have no ""tactics"".

My position now is that I don't care -- I'm convinced that the world isn't catastrophically warming, and no amount of fudging of climate models is going to change that, so I have stopped worrying.  Of all the things government wastes money on, alternative energy sources is one of the least offensive, so I don't worry about that any more either.

In short: do what you like, believe what you like, find as many ""scientists"" as you like to commit as many _argument by numbers_ or _argument from authority_ logical fallicies as you like, shout as much offensive rhetoric as you like at people like me on reddit; in the end the world hasn't warmed for 18 years (in complete contradiction of the 97% accepted climate models) and that's all that matters.

We are in unbelievably desperate need of attacking midfielders. It's so glaringly obvious. Failure to bring any players in for this position would be total negligence. If possible, another central midfielder with an offensive mindset and a striker would be very useful. But the basic essential is a couple of attacking midfielders - doesn't matter if it's a loan or a transfer. They just have to get. it. done.


The defence (and defensive midfield positions) are fine for now. We have the 5th best defence in the country and a fair amount of depth. I would leave any potential defensive moves until the summer.


As for Vlaar and Delph, I would sell either of them if the right offer came in. We need those transfer funds to sign their replacements. But I would want to avoid losing both. Vlaar I think we could get away with not replacing him until the summer. Delph would require an immediate replacement. Cleverley: Don't spend money on him now.

null,false,Reborno,null,null,null,"The problem with our team this season is that our right flank is very weak in comparison with the left flank.
We have absolutely no threat going forward when we have Willian on (he has played almost all our games) which forces Ivanovic to come forward to carry that threat (especially since Hazard overloads the left flank and drags defenders out of position). When we lose possession, our opponent should counter on our right flank where Ivanovic is out of position. If Matic isn't there to protect and get the ball back, we're fucked. Cahill is absolutely awful when he's 1 on 1 vs an attacker, he just backs off, isn't proactive and is terrorized to make a decision (countless examples this season already, since the beginning like against Swansea, Crystal Palace etc).
This is no surprise as Cahill is a very good defender when we play with a compact low block like last season, where he's protected by a wall of other Chelsea players, then he can make last ditch tackles and everyone is in awe. In our new playstyle this season, where we play with a high line, high press possession football, he's not good enough, actually he's pretty bad.
So I keep seeing chelsea fans complaining about Ivanovic out of position and Cahill being awful, but the reason in the first place that Ivanovic comes out is because Willian can't do shit in the final third. He can't score, can't assist, can't cross, can't make a decision, loses possession, make side ways passes and every fucking defender can read him. I don't think that his tracking back (the only real thing he brings) as a £30mil AM/winger is enough, and actually imo he causes more problems than he solves. But somehow he's a favourite of José. I'd love to see him benched and let Schürrle, who is a real threat going forward, get a long stretch of games.

Quite a lot

Honestly there's not allot I can find problems with - Its got a great separate kids library, large dvd rental section. Several floors of books.

Theres a nice exhibition area....In fact that a potential good idea for library that don't do such things. Put on an exhibition.

Interesting fact about the library (well...the only library)....when the old one burnt down many valuable books/documents where damaged not due to fire, but due to water damage from trying to put out the fire. And without immediate treatment these books/documents and manuscripts (some 100s of years old) would be lost. So local companies (who had access to large freezers) rallied round to collect the items to freeze them, and in effect preserve them. 

When they had the time the books where thawed out, in controlled conditions and saved.

That didn't used to be the case (renting only a home, I mean). People rented all sorts of other things like phones, TVs and fridges. They don't any more because those things can be had dirt cheap, if you want them to be.

This discussion has revealed that few have considered the real consequences of changing the definition of marriage, they seem only to interpret the exclusion of gay relationships as inequality, when in fact the inclusion of it alone (and not all other forms on the same grounds) is just as much an example of inequality. This can logically only lead to the further redefining of marriage later. In some ways I wonder if this whole issue is not about equality (which we have seen is relative to whatever group you support) but one of justification, ie my relationship is valid because I can join this club in society and be married if I choose. I suppose it's a mix of all if that in a way.

Inflation is under reported. Wages are stagnant. Anyone who doesn't have investments is getting spitroasted by duff economic policy.

This is far beyond clinical recommendations on treatment times. Thankfully we marched and campaigned and eventually it was ruled as unlawful in court. Unfortunately MPs then changed the law to make it legal, so we'll see what the future holds.

I am not happy with government reforms of the NHS.

&gt;Travel

The rail network is improving but still not good in terms of price and service. South Eastern won their franchise again, somehow.

&gt;Culture

Gentrification has gripped London over the past five years. For my local area this is not a bad thing, which was quite dilapidated despite having a fair number of middle and upper middle incomes in the area. The local highstreet received a £3 million makeover which has improved things. The high house prices have driven out many poorer residents from the area, as well as cuts to funding for special needs and care in the community individuals. I feel that disabled people are worse off today than in 2009, despite the legislation passed in 2010.

&gt;Immigration

Lots of bright young things arriving in London. For nearly every industry this has lead to stagnating wages. Despite this, the quality of innovation and business in London is absolutely world-class at the moment because we are vacuuming up the best of the rest of the world's young folk.

null,false,KlutchAtStraws,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,null,"I remember the invasion of the Falklands from when I was very young.  I remember news footage of Argentines in Buenos Aries burning the Union Flag.  For a long time I hated the Argentinians (with the exception of Ossie Ardiles and Ricky Villa who played for Spurs).  This was even worse when Maradonna cheated with the 'hand of God' in the 86 world cup.  That was all I knew about Argentina and the Falklands.

Recently I discovered a brilliant Argentinian crime author called Ernesto Mallo and his work prompted me to read up on Argentina and the Dirty War, the Night of the Pencils, ESMA etc.  The regime of Videla and Galtieri was absolutely monstrous and I think Garage Olimpo is one of the bleakest movies I've ever seen.

So my view on the Falklands is that Argentina has been through enough and the Argentinian people have been utterly let down by their leaders.  We have nothing to complain about in comparison.  I think you would do well to focus more on your domestic social, political and economic issues before worrying about the Falklands.

As others have said, the 82 invasion led by what was effectively a fascist junta meant any peaceful handover was ruled out as an option for a very long time to come.

&gt;to change marriage for one on certain grounds legitimises the claim of all individuals who wish to make further changes on the same grounds


It sets a precedent that marriage can in fact be changed however it does not mean that any future suggestions will just be automatically accepted. The suggestions must prove to be valid and able to fall under the context and definition of marriage. 

Homosexuality is not a choice no more than race or hair colour is a choice, and allowing gay marriage between 2 consenting adults doesn't cause any more harm to anyone than current marriage would. Therefore why wouldn't civil marriage be changed to include gay marriages? 

In many of the other examples you have given there could be (and I emphasise the *could* as that is up to people more educated in these matters than me to demonstrate) issues that would cause harm to the married persons or people in their environment. If someone wants to change the law they must demonstrate that it is reasonable to do so.

To be honest your position is a tough one to give advice on.  i don't want to sound patronising, but the first step is probably to really understand what investment is vs saving. it comes with real risk and the reason people will be reluctant to start giving advice is they don't want to send you down the wrong path based on incomplete information.

this won't be news to you, but the risk of losing money is real and painful if you ever experience it. you should be wary of people who say flippant things like the quote above - oh, the guy lost a bit of money, but he was ok because the company was 100 years old. there is no guarantee, not age, not prior performance, even thorough research can go awry if you're unlucky.  

while you are starting off and (i assume) investing while also working a day job, you might like to consider investing in asset-managed funds.  the advantages here are that other people do the legwork (doing research into what stocks are cheap) and they are better diversified than your personal portfolio could ever be (so the effect of 1 bankruptcy is limited).  they still come with risk, and without the feeling of being properly in control, so you need to think about what you want to get out of this.

null,false,kingofthejaffacakes,uk,United Kingdom,null,"&gt; How is citing scientists - the people who actually understand this subject better then anyone else - an empty ""appeal to authority""?

It doesn't matter who you're appealing to -- if you claim an argument is right simply because of who says it, it's an appeal to authority.

The people who are going to make mistakes in a field are, almost by definition, the people who are working in that field.  How then can you judge their argument by the fact that they are working in that field?  Instead I try to read what I can about their arguments, and personally, I find those arguments lacking.

&gt; Quite telling how you refer to ""scientists"" in scare quotes by the way. 

Because I believe science is about skepticism, I'm concerned that climate change scientists are [not being scientific](http://neurotheory.columbia.edu/~ken/cargo_cult.html) and hence aren't acting as scientists, but they obviously naming themselves so, so I quote their names.

&gt; It's a kind of scientific integrity, a principle of scientific thought that corresponds to a kind of utter honesty--a kind of leaning over backwards. For example, if you're doing an experiment, you should report everything that you think might make it invalid--not only what you think is right about it: other causes that could possibly explain your results; and things you thought of that you've eliminated by some other experiment, and how they worked--to make sure the other fellow can tell they have been eliminated.

I have been a researcher in my past.  I hold a PhD.  If I were to have presented research with the level of statistical rigour that I see in many of these climate papers I would have been laughed out of my viva.  I am concerned that these people are doing damage to science itself.

&gt; Finally it's not about belief - or rather whether one sides beliefs should be regarded as having equal validity to the others. They don't. One side is millions of times more credible than the other because it has evidence, fieldwork and the scientific method backing it up. To bad that isn't ""fair"", but this isn't nursery school. 

I certainly wasn't arguing that my beliefs change anything -- they are my beliefs though, just as yours are yours; and I was stating them in the hopes that that would be enough to demonstrate that I'm not that interested in arguing about this.  I've given up to be honest, I see which way the wind is blowing -- skeptics who state they are skeptical are instantly assumed to be crackpots.

Just when you understand that you, the customer, are not actually the customer.  Network Rail are the customer, and they ""bought"" the cheapest train service they could from the various providers who bid for the rights to run that service...
Sometimes they chose a slightly dearer service to get a higher level of provision etc. but in effect, they are the customer, and the train cos are the vendor.
You're just the user.  You're a ""factored cost"" for the vendors...how much money they can squeeze from you whilst spending as little as possible on the service is their business model.

Personally I think the best model is state-owned, run by a non-profit...much like the way the ferries here in Scotland are run - they're run by Caledonia MacBayne, a private company.  It just so happens that private company are ""owned"" by the Scottish ministers.

They're not perfect, but I'd warrant they're a lot better than a state-owned state-run company, and certainly better than private companies bidding on state-contracts in some labyrinthian process, shrouded in ""commercial sensitivity"" and kept back from the prying eyes of transparency and accountability.

null,false,BooksBiscuitsTea,null,null,null,"&gt;...What's good about your local library?

The staff are competent and friendly. Unfortunately, from my perspective, that's absolutely it. 

**Disclaimer:** It has been a good two years since I've been into my local branch library; so the following - hopefully - is no longer the case:

The book selection is pitiful, unless you're into books popular with pensioners; the I.T. facilities are even worse - it's a socio-economically deprived area; Good I.T. facilities would be a fantastic resource not only for local unemployed folks, but also people wanting to bid on council properties. 

As it is, the three PCs available are usually booked a solid fortnight in advance, and of the hour you get? It takes at least 10 minutes to get onto the internet. They do offer free wi-fi; of course that requires you bring your own device. If you can afford one.

Almost every day there's an event / club running. That's great - libraries have to evolve from buildings housing dead tree books, into community hubs. Unfortunately opening the doors, to be greeted by the sound of the 'Mother and baby, cup of tea, and a wee-gossip' group is enough to bring on an immediate headache.

In short, if you wanted to use it as a quiet space - a place to learn? No. Bloody. Chance. Even the after school homework sessions are loud.

Now, moaning over...

&gt;*What would you like to see at your library.*

Firstly I'd like it to remain open; having seen the planned decimation of the local council budgets, I doubt it'll remain past 2016. But on the assumption it remains open:

* VASTLY improve the I.T. facilities. I'd want 8 - 10 PCs, 90 minute sessions, rather than just an hour, and change the booking system so people can only book a few days in advance.

* User guides - nothing professional, just leaflets / print-outs people can pick up, not only detailing beginner level I.T. courses available to them either at that library, or the main one, but also a ""Primer"" of sorts, on how to use the 'net for various things that people might want to do, but not know how.

* Improve the available book selection.  Ethel from down the road, who stands at the counter blocking it for everyone, might enjoy her Catherine Cookson, and her Meg Hutchinson, but how about some variety? Your Science Fiction and Fantasy section shouldn't consist of one small bookcase. For both categories.

* Scrap inter-library loan charges. It shouldn't cost £5 to request an inter-library loan. Notice the word 'request' - if after the search they can't find it, you don't get a refund.

* Recommendations. This one boggles my mind; If I mention 'Ooh I'm a fan of [Author] - do you happen to know any similar authors? Or works in a similar vein' I shouldn't be directed to typing the name of the book into Amazon. Or LibraryThing, by the member of staff who will tell anyone he 'hates' eBooks, and Amazon. On that topic.

* Some people read eBooks. Get. The. Fuck. Over. It. You are supposed to be facilitators of learning and knowledge; don't be a conceited so-and-so if someone asks about eBooks. No you aren't an Amazon help-desk; yes you could express that to customers a wee-bit more politely.

No online comments should be illegal.  There is no objective measure for what is 'grossly offensive' and what isn't.  

In any other crime you can measure the damage done.  The amount of physical injuries that a person has received in a attack, the amount of goods stolen in a burglary.  How can you measure how offended a person feels?  You can't because it's inside their head.  

Take these two statements:
""There is a god.""
""There isn't a god.""

They are contradictory but different people would find one of them grossly offensive.  Which statement should we prosecute?  Obviously neither contains a specific offensive word but a small passionate minority would find the statements, far, far more offensive than any swear words.

Income: I'm earning slightly more before tax because of promotions, and  taking home more after tax, because of Tory tax policy change. **+1**

Housing: Since 2009, I bought a property, and I now own it. **+1**

Education: n/a. 

Work: I've been in the same company since 2009, and it is, unfortunately, a company that the Tories privatized.  This has made things much tighter for us all-round, and has been pretty negative. **-1**

Health: The NHS is still great. I haven't used it personally, but the lady did yesterday (we both slipped and fell on the way home from New Years, I got up and kept going because I'm a big burly bloke, she made a faint snapping sound and had to be helped from that point), and she was treated almost immediately. They were also excellent with all three of the grandparents of mine who've died in the past two years. **+1**

Travel: Better. This is more of a personal thing, though, since it's only been in the past couple of years that I've overcome my deep phobia of flying. It's nice to pay £50 to visit a foreign country, *and* not panic to the point of being sick over the prospect of going onto a plane. I'm up over $150 a month now for the lowest tv and internet.
**+1**

Culture: Mixed. Music is getting better. The latter period of the 00s were a bit of a dead zone creatively, but the last five years have given us an absolute golden era for pop. There's still a lot of dross out there, but this is the first time in a long time that I actually get *excited* at the prospect of hearing something new on the radio, because it might actually be something new. Movies are getting better (partly, I think, due to the writers strike becoming history and CGI being used a lot more sensibly), TV has gone downhill, but on-demand access to programming has generally improved. In terms of entertainment culture anyway, I like the way things are going **+1**

Immigration: I've got a lot of respect for anyone brave enough to move to another country and start their lives over, in the hope of getting what's best for them, and best for their families. Absolutely admire that. However, it's impossible to overlook the effects of immigration. Flooding the low-end of the labour pool has massively empowered employers, who can now offer the absolute barest of minimums to any potential employee, and they'll take it, because those people in that labour pool are desperate for *anything*. **0**

One of the reasons I set up a limited company was to protect myself and participants from potential losses. Were the tournament to not go ahead for some reason, my business insurance will cover the full refund of any tickets, as well as having a firm body to be held accountable for any miss-handled business.
I have the company house registration on my site, and I believe you can search for it through companies house.

I am glad that someone has brought up paid entry as a topic however, as I'd like to be fully transparent with the whole tournament.
We do not have any cash sponsors, so sadly this tournament cannot exist without paid entry. We would not be able to provide quality casting, decent raffle prizes or a substantial 1st place cash pool were that the case. 

One thing I think is very important when asking for money off people for anything is providing value. 
To this means, I wanted amateur and semi-pro teams to both be able to get something worthwhile from this tournament. For the top-tier teams, there is an opportunity to compete in a high level UK specific tournament, with a substantial prize pool. And for the lower tiers, an opportunity to play at least 5 games in a competitive arena, with commentators, spectators and raffle prizes for all entrants.

I have put up £500 of my own money for the prize pool, 25% of ticket sales will also contribute towards increasing this. As for the rest of the money, approximately 10% goes to the credit card company for handling, I estimate a further £200-300 will go on additional raffle prizes (we have some now, but we will need more), the casters will need compensating, and I hope (big fingers crossed) to recoup the initial outlay of £500.

I realize this may be a long-winded response to your points, but it has also provided me with an opportunity to raise some important explanations of who we are and what we are trying to achieve :)

He was dealing with who he really is and what makes him good, whether 11 was a mask that he used to deal with killing kids in the time war or who he really is, whether it is right to make life and death decisions for others, whether or not ""the Doctor"" is ""good"" or not, this season showed him stepping back and dealing with te fact that ""the Doctor"" was never his original name and who is this character he choose for himself now? That's why the final revelation that he is really just an adventurer and explorer, passing though, helping out, not looking to do good or bad but doing what is right when he can was satisfying. 

12 seemed to have a lot of conflict between his own non utilitarian morals and the fact that he feels a need to take on choices that necessitate ultilitarianism so that others don't have to. Even if he continues to end up in these scenarios now, he needn't worry about who he really is but just do what is right and move on. 

In Deep Breath Clara references her love of Marcus Aurelius who she previously quoted in Day of the Doctor saying, ""Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one."" That was the conclusion the Doctor finally reached after all these years of time war angst.

Clara's arc this season was about her becoming more Doctor like and also taking on some of his negative traits which increased his difficulty with these questions. The episodes that this was most clear in were Mummy and Flatline which came right after she was forced into the position of making a scary choice in Kill the Moon. Season 8 was about a softening of 12 as he refound himself, and a corruption of Clara as she took on some of his traits and was torn between dual lives. Clara went from his conscience and teacher in Into the Dalek to happily utilitarian in Flatline and just as prone to lying and manipulating to ""help"" as he was by the cafe scene.

The tragedy is that up until 1982 a lot of the Falklanders used to travel to Patagonia for seasonal work, and relations with Argentina were generally quite good. Unfortunately every time an accommodation seemed possible, the Argentine government blew it by annoying the islanders. 

For example in the 1970s the British government decided that it was too expensive to subsidise shipping links between Britain and the Falklands, and negotiations began for a direct air link with Argentina. Unfortunately the air link was provided by LADE, and the islanders were predictably upset by the sight of Argentine military aircraft landing at Stanley.

I personally am delighted if we slot into top 4 this year, but if we hit 5-7, I'm delighted with that as well. Given the type of turmoil in the previous two years, I'm absolutely ok with anything inside the top 7. Yes, every year we sort of ""expect"" top 4, but only the gullible and blind really have believed in the previous two years that we were owed or destined for top four. We don't have (yet!) the depth of quality like City or United. We have players who could be those players, yet are a few years younger. 

The biggest considerations for our club right now is gaining consistency in the play and developing the confidence that comes to clubs who have the big balls in the league. We can't go out and drop 3 points to Leicester, then smash Chelsea 5-3.  Top four clubs don't do that (or realistically shouldn't be). We must go out whether we're playing relegation battling teams or Manchester City with the ""Lads, WE'RE FUCKING TOTTENHAM"" and demand 5-2 wins over either side regardless of their position in the league. I don't care if that comes from balls to the walls attacking, or counter-attacking City's overloaded middle. 

We truly did see the ""WE ARE TOTTENHAM"" yesterday right after going down 1-0. The boys didn't break down, the boys didn't break down and change the game plan. They kept trucking and I think that surprised Chelsea a bit. Chelsea is used to getting up a goal and expecting the opposition to slump into a defensive mess. Fazio kept on hassling Costa, and Rose kept on pissing off Ivanovic. Kane gave hell to the back-line and Townsend embarrassed Azi. Dembele and Bentaleb put so much pressure in the middle of the park we watched Chelsea only play wide for over half an hour. We don' see Chelsea resort to only wide play often. 

Once we can gain some stability in the consistency of our play, coupled with the growth of some key players creating stronger relationships, I think you could see Spurs side be a fucking force. I'll argue that next summer, having Poch secure a couple (2-3 tops) transfers that increase the talent and depth of our squad could be quite nice and a good side for top four football, but with that I truly expect Poch to hold onto the likes of Lloris, Vert, Eriksen, Chadli, Lamela for next year.

null,false,chrisjd,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,null,"It depends on your definition of tax avoidance. Some people seem to want to lump in exploiting loopholes with simply not pay tax due to using the system in the way the government intended. The more sensible way to look at it is that if you ""avoid"" tax by saving in an ISA (which is just the government encouraging you to save) or paying into a pension (which is just the government encouraging you to save again, this time for your old age), this is entirely different than avoiding tax by for example setting up a fake company in the Cayman Islands. I'm sure the Green party take the latter sensible nuanced approach, rather than your slightly bizarre black and white one. The only reason I could see to take your view on tax avoidance would be to pretend that immoral abuse of the tax system is the same as using the system as intended.

HMRC have defined tax avoidance, for the purposes of calculating the tax gap, [here (page 14)](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/statistics/tax-gaps/mtg-2013.pdf):

&gt;Avoidance is exploiting the tax rules to gain a tax advantage that Parliament never
intended. It often involves contrived, artificial transactions that serve little or no
commercial purpose other than to produce a tax advantage. It involves operating
within the letter, but not the spirit of the law.

&gt;Tax avoidance is not the same as legitimate tax planning. Legitimate tax planning involves
using tax reliefs for the purpose for which they were intended. For example, claiming
tax relief on capital investment, saving in a tax-exempt ISA or saving for retirement by
making contributions to a pension scheme are all legitimate forms of tax planning.",null,0,null,1420209821,null,0,1420210146,0,cnc5dll,null,t3_2r3d83,null,t1_cnc5dll,null,t1_cnc51wr,null,null,null,1425100775,null,18,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,18,null

Not one bit of the modern Falklands has any distinctly Argentinian/Spanish feel. It was only successfully settled and developed under British sovereignty, starting over 100 years ago. It's a very tough place, and the Islanders are a hardy type who scratched out an existence until the arrival of resource-based revenue (initially fishing). 

It was also a peaceful place for 100+ years until the 1980s, when a junta (whose despicable morality created ""The Disappeared"" as well) decided that it would cover itself in glory by using the blood a few hundred poor and conscripted servicemen. 

So here we are now. How can you make the claims 'valid'? Proximity is not it (which is why Spain does not want to talk about Ceuta and Melilla when trying to force the Gibraltar issue). All around the world are examples of strange outposts of distant countries.

Claims of 'colonialism' are hollow when made by colonists. But they are made irrelevant by that referendum and even moreso by the UN's position on self-determination.

Claims don't come from well-organised PR events, such as an Argentinian athlete training there before the 2012 Olympic games and the 2014 Argentina football team holding a 'Malvinas' flag in the World Cup. These may play well at home, create some great photos and media moments, but against a near-100% referendum in the Islands, these are no more than stunts.

What's left? Well, Argentina may try to validate its claims by (trying to) take the Islands by force. Events in Crimea and the simmering Senkaku Islands dispute might even make that look a remotely realistic  possibility. I hope for our brothers' and sisters' sake that no-one there acts on that.

You won't recoup your £500 unless 80 teams enter, and you also talk of compensating casters and providing raffle prizes, too. There is also the issue of team stability, and you can't ignore that some teams won't sign to a second season - if FESL taught us anything it's that teams below 3.5k will feel very put off after heavily losing a couple of games.

One of your biggest challenges will be to keep the majority of teams happy, and you won't always get a second chance by saying 'it'll be better next season with different divisions'. I would strongly suggest an exclusive lower bracket after the group stages for the teams that fail to progress. This ensures there is still competition and gives them the incentive to continue knowing they're playing similarly-skilled teams. If you get a sponsor to provide a consolation prize then that would be something. Insomnia run a similar setup, and though I've never been to it, I think it did a good job of giving lesser teams something to play for. It's more administrative work, but if you are thinking of more than one season, you will need sponsorship or you will find yourself just giving the top few teams your own money.

I wish you the best of luck and I probably will compete. It would be really good for the scene and you're right about the value new teams will get from having their games casted. It's a nice feeling, that first time.

null,false,Keratome,null,null,null,"So for a different perspective : Mourinho chose  his normal spurs plan at white hart lane and it didn't work out  
After the Man Utd game , Mourinho thought he could have rolled into WHL with a less physical/more attacking mindset midfield and win. One of the reasons our results @ home aren't great is that most teams come here defensively minded and hitting on the counterattack, the matches we have won are usually due to individual brilliance. Conversely when we are on the road, the home team plays for a win , so generally less defensively which suits our style.  
Mourinho realised this later on in the game and brought on Ramires, and fortunately for us it was a bit too late.  
Not taking away from Kane who was exceptionally brilliant (he already has a plan of what to do before the ball reaches to him, esp when you look at the fourth goal).  
We still need a pacey hard working striker upfront, hope we get one during the transfer window, but who knows maybe chadli is that guy (eventually)  
Games will not be easy for us now as other teams are going to park the bus against us at home, and possibly even away. We have the quality to win and I am optimistic we will be top 4 this season, we are not that far off considering how we started the season, there has been decent improvement, I don't see why that doesn't continue

/u/CarmineCerise logic. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯


With the information provided, it is just as likely that either scenario is true. Unless you have more information, why do you assume that the boys are guilty? Given the age difference, it is actually more likely that the older child took advantage of the younger child. You say nothing in the article suggests that the boys were raped, of course it doesn't. I mean, if sex took place then they were, because of their age, but that's really beside the point because the girls are underage too. Nothing in the article actually even suggests the girls were raped either, it just states that something was investigated and couldn't go any further because of the boys' ages.

The fact is, my comment makes sense, yours does too, but you are making assumptions based on information you don't have. Mine is based on the available information that we do have, which is the ages of the children and the overall general likelihood of other factors based on this. Weapons? Not that likely for an 8 year old. Overpowered? 13-16 year old girls are stronger than 8 year old boys. Manipulated socially or emotionally? An 8 year old is not as mentally capable or emotionally complex as a 13-16 year old.

PS. I was being mostly sarcastic in my first comment, note the ""/s"". 

EDIT: Quoting your comment since you quoted mine just now for some reason. I'm not deleting it if that's what you're anticipating.

&gt;You know literally nothing about the situation other than the fact that the police investigated and recorded it, and they weren't charged because they were under age, but that's clearly not stopping you from going on with your ridiculous ignorant strawmans.

How so? Selling gold reserves at their lowest point in decades? PPI's, huge amount of wasteful spending?
 
&gt; Labour's main mistake with the economy was in banking regulation, or rather the lack of it. This flaw was shared with the Conservatives to a large extent.

Totally agree with you here, it stemmed from policies written in the 80's and 90's by the Tories, but Blair/Brown had 10 years in power and did nothing to prepare for or prevent the crash - and actually enhanced the risk.

&gt; Their level of public spending before the crash, while in my opinion wasteful at times, was eminently sustainable.

Possibly, but during prosperity, you save and pay back national debt, during recessions, you invest. Labour spent spent and spent more.
 
&gt; And cutting spending during a recession has an entirely predictable outcome. 

What, we've one of the few growing economies in Europe? The top debt rating possible? Low unemployment? As I say, don't get me wrong, the Tories are no angels, but to knock their achievements and ignore the total failure of the previous government is disingenuous.

null,false,mab92,null,null,null,"Never said ""patriarchal conspiracy"", don't put words in my mouth. The notion that, in a representative democracy, people from all parts of society should feel they have the chance to act as a representative, is not some radical feminist idea, and when we see such a wide gap like the one I outlined above, it is worth asking why that is, and whether action can be taken to increase representation.

&gt;Fewer women putting themselves forward as candidates?

Yes, that is kind of implied. The question is why, and more importantly, is there anyone discouraged by the lack of women who see the HoC as more of a boys club? It's a tricky one to answer, but representation has been shown to have an impact on career choices so it can't be quickly dismissed: http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding

&gt;More women pursuing careers they don't want to put on hold for a political circus?

That doesn't answer a whole lot. What are these careers women are pursuing that they won't give up, while men in politics seem to be able to put careers on hold? 

&gt;Less general female tolerance for the exposition of public life?

That may well be an issue. It could be argued that better representation would help that (seeing more women in politics encourages more women to take the jump into politics), but neither of us know either way so I'll leave it.

We can disagree over the root causes, but I think it's hard to look at the fact that over three-quarters of representatives are men and say that no explanation is needed.",null,0,null,1420213601,null,0,false,0,cnc6wmd,null,t3_2qxjzs,null,t1_cnc6wmd,null,t1_cnc627j,null,null,null,1425100062,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

* Economy - **+ve** I feel like things have gotten better since 2009, at least there's less disaster reporting in the news about the economy! That's not necessarily the best source, but it's the only judgement I can make myself.

Unpaid internships are a scandal - you can only take them if you are already wealthy and have somewhere you can stay for free in the area (most probably London).

Privatisation of any public services is nothing more than a vehicle for the friends of those in power to make money.  And the formula is so simple, yet the masses that read the media (who, btw, are in on it too) fall for it every time...

If your friends identify a public service that they can make money from, simply cut the funding, and keep cutting the funding until said public service is on its knees and looking awful...then wave the privatisation magic wand, and boom, your friends make a bucket load of money, and we the people have to pay.

null,false,HashPram,eng-yorkshire,Yaakshur,null,"&gt; Income/wealth - do you feel more comfortable about your income now, or back then?  

About the same as before. I've got the same job now as I had then, but I've been fortunate enough to get the odd pay rise.  
  
&gt; Housing - how has your situation differed between the timeframe, or has it stayed the same?    

About the same. I've moved house, but other than that haven't noticed a massive difference.  
  
&gt; Education    

I've been out of education for 19 years now and I don't have kids, so this isn't something I tend to keep an eye on.  
  
&gt; Economy - how do you feel about this?    

Regardless of what they say or like to believe, the government has fuck-all control of the economy because it's mostly determined by the world market (i.e. everyone else).  
I don't feel anything about the economy. It's like the sky: It'll be there regardless of how I feel about it. Mainly I try and avoid it when it rains but that's about it.  
  
&gt; Work and welfare    

I've been made redundant before (2001) and struggled to find work. It was shit and I don't envy anyone in that position.  
Still, I was in a job in 2009 and I'm in the same job now. I wouldn't mind a change, but I'm not going to do it just for the sake.  
  
&gt; Health      

My old doctor's were great. Never a problem getting an appointment and they seemed to have GPs who knew what they were talking about.  
Moved house and the new doctor's is pretty shit. The GPs aren't that helpful (bar information I could get from a leaflet), they mainly seem to act as a referral service to the hospital. Appointments can either be booked a   fortnight in advance, or by repeat-dialling them once they're open and trying to get an appointment on the day. Also I've had an argument with one of their receptionists when I had the temerity to turn up one minute past closing   time on a Friday and ask for my prescription.
A&amp;E, OTOH, have been fucking fantastic.  
Overall then, mixed.    
    
&gt; Travel    

I drive to work up the M1 from Sheffield to Leeds. A good 15-20 miles of it is roadworks. They're installing a managed motorway, which I'm sure will help ease traffic flow once it's finished, but it seems to be suffering from   both feature-creep (it started as ""Replacing barriers - ready in 2014"" and changed to ""Installing managed motorway - expected completion sometime after you're dead - this is your life now, bumhole. HAR! HAR! HAR!"" halfway through 2014), and people doing literally fuck-all. I swear I've seen maybe two blokes doing something on the entire stretch since November. I don't mind going slowly when people are working but just slapping 50mph signs up for 2 years and only working half of that time is getting quite close to taking the piss.  
I stopped using trains &amp; buses 15 years ago when I bought my first car and realised I didn't have to wait in the rain, or for someone else to turn up &amp; give me a lift before I could go out.  
I fly abroad. I hate the security-theatre nonsense. I think I'd honestly rather plummet to a firey death in the ocean than have to put up with a load of pompous cunts scrutinising my belonging for the wrong kind of liquid in the   wrong bottle, although I can see how if they found it it would surely cause the entire fucking world to end [/s]
  
&gt; Culture  

I've stopped listening to music. I'm not bored of it, exactly, it just stopped playing a meaningful part in my daily life. Odd because I write music for a hobby.  
I've also stopped listening to the radio and just listen to podcasts when I'm driving. Can't stand DJs prattling on at me, or the cunts on Radio 4 being all serious about the latest pointless brouhaha.  
I don't watch TV any more - I watch YouTube &amp; Netflix. Occasionally my brother or people at work will recommend watching something - mostly I ignore them because next week I'll ""just have to watch"" something else. It's all a big fucking merry-go-round of watching TV and I never get anything done. I'd rather sit and watch clouds for 3 hours than fill my head with that shit. Breaking Bad was alright though: I did enjoy that.  
Stopped watching comedy when I realised I enjoyed Doug Stanhope and that was about it. Went to see him in Leeds. Actually laughed for 3 hours. That was a good night.    
I saw John Sim at The Crucible doing Hamlet - it was OK.    
I haven't been to an art gallery for years. Don't have much to say about paintings and sculpture - I either like them or I don't and that's about as much analysis as I can be arsed to do.    
I've played some Minecraft. It's pretty good.  
I've played Settlers Of Catan. That's pretty good too.  
I've read a lot more comics the last couple of years. Also read my way through some really quite dull history, some slightly less dull history, a few sci-fi novels, and the odd book of poetry.  
  
&gt; Immigration  

No direct experience of this. Eventually we'll get a world government and teleportation and we'll be free to work where the fuck we like. Until then nation states will continue to get agitated and go on about people not filling   in the correct bits of paper before travelling.  
  
TL;DR  
I'm getting older and grouchier and given that I was pretty fucking grouchy 4 years ago I'm swiftly becoming unapproachably cantankerous. Don't recommend I watch anything on the TV because I'll just ignore you. Still, I'm currently better off than I was in 1989 with no qualifications and Margaret Thatcher's bloody brilliant idea of making everyone in South Yorkshire unemployed. Stupid cow.

I don't agree with you about his physicality though, I think he's good at making tackles, pressing and recycling balls, which is in fact the role of CM, not an AM. I think Mourinho should just play Fabregas in his place as number 10 and play Oscar in CM.

She's representing her [own constituency](http://www.carolinelucas.com/). Why would she be trying to represent anyone else? 

&gt; It's also very much a problem for the wealthy.

The Irony that you're accusing the author of this being out of touch, then you come off with a statement like this. You make it sound like only rich people ride trains, rather than working class folk who are forced to make long commutes because it's hard enough to find jobs these days. Look at the figures she's using:

&gt; whose journey to and from work could cost the equivalent of 8.6 weeks of net earnings – more than £4,400. That’s 17% of the average regional salary

If £4,400 is 17% of the average regional salary, that means the average salary is somewhere around £26k - hardly what you would call ""wealthy"", is it?

Not only that, but with Reus's buyout clause only being a paltry 20 million, and Benzema would probably get sold for at least 50, they'd make a huge profit too. 

As for Bayern, why does it have to stop? They clearly have a need at the wing positions, as Ribery and Robben are in their 30's, and are both very injury prone. He's stated first and foremost that he wants to win titles with the club he goes to, and well there's no place in the world where you're going to win more titles than Bayern, and he wouldn't have to leave his home country which he loves. 

I would jizz literally everywhere if Reus came here. But I don't think there's the slightest chance that happens.

I want to start off by saying how impressed I am with how we've done, we've done so much better than I expected. Our budget is not as large as a lot are reporting, it was slashed significantly in the summer and we've had to rely on lots of free signings. We're playing some nice football and getting results doing it. I am very pleased.

Our stand-out performer, for me, is Stuart Sinclair. He's a machine. He runs for the entire game, puts some brilliant tackles in, causes the opposition a lot of problems with his seemingly unlimited energy. He compliments Mansell so well. 

I would have Mansell and Taylor in just behind Sinclair. 

I have been pretty underwhelmed with a few signings but mostly the loanees. Spiess wasn't great, Wall was a waste of space, and Martin's shite. Most of our first team permanent squad members are brilliant. 

Our best result is undoubtedly beating Macclesfield 4-0 on 28th December. Our highest amount scored in a game against a side, at the time, with the best defensive record in the league. 

My favourite result has to be, surprisingly, the 1-1 draw with Eastleigh. It was an eventful game, we had two players sent off, but showed our heart and desire and pulled back and held on with a lot of fight. Ollie Clarke's goal was insane too. 

The team that's impressed me the most has to be Wrexham. They played nice football and were unlucky not to leave The Mem with at least a point.

I don't think we have the fire power to win the league, unless of course the Tubbs rumours come to fruition and even then it's still a tough ask. We've proven ourselves to be a tough outfit, apart from our poor start we've only lost once and only one of those to promotion rivals. We've beaten Barnet, Halifax, Macclesfield, Gateshead, Woking and Kidderminster. 

Play-offs are a different kettle of fish, though. I'd be quietly confident of winning them but we'll see.

I think, unless they lose Akinde and Martin Allen, Barnet are going to win the league. Play-offs will be Bristol Rovers, Macclesfield, Halifax and Eastleigh.

That's a copyright thing, which is a totally different issue.

&gt; Could be very troublesom though. If you were on TV and held up a big newspaper article which had had a super injunction taken out on it and then said ""but I'm only commenting on it"" as you waved it around the camera and made a few token gestures, then it would probably not stand up in a court of law.

No, you're going to be cited for contempt in that situation and in all likelihood hammered for it. The only way you could discuss the existence of a superinjunction is if you make no reference, direct or otherwise, to the person who took it out or what the story under injunction might be. And even then you'll be testing a court's patience.

- Income/wealth - income has gone up, I was promoted in 2010. The small amount of debt I had was paid off after my Afghanistan deployment in 2009 and the ones in 2011 and 2013 have given me a good amount of savings. 
- Housing - Slightly worse, I now pay £65 for my room on the RAF base where I work, that is inclusive of bills though so I'm not gonna complain, but last year it was £45. Cant complain though, it really helps me save for the future. 
- Education - No change for me. 
- Economy - It's not too bad for me, I'm in a very secure job and should be okay when I leave the RAF in a few years regardless of the economy.
- Work and welfare - As you will have seen, I'm in the RAF. As I've done 18 nearly 18 years my pension isn't really affected that much by the changes that were forced onto us. 
- Health - I have had nothing but positive experiences with the NHS, and I've had a lot of experience in the past year. 
- Travel - Both seem okay to me, I mainly drive and yeah you get some roadworks now and again but I've not seen anything that makes me think it's worse than 2009. Same with rail travel, I like using trains when I do, rarely get delayed and if I do it's not the end of the world. If I were a commuter I may think differently. 
- Culture - I'm 36, I'm pretty much middle-aged, I'm starting to get to that point where 'the youth of today' are very different. I find it interesting to see the changes in not only myself but how young people are. Do I think it's a good thing? Of course not, just like my dad didn't when i was a kid.
- Immigration - Loving all the Polish delis and also I've seen an increase in Chinese supermarkets where I live, that is great for me, I love trying new foods.

Important Names:

* Mauricio Pochettino/Poch/Mr P/MP. Our manager, joined us after a great time at Southampton.

* Daniel Levy, our chairman. Notorious for great deals such as Eriksen for £12m, and awful signings like Soldado for £26m.

* [Christian Eriksen, possibly our star outfield player](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Es1YXxI_Us). Top midfielder in the league for goals and assists this calendar year. Absolute steal at £12m.

* [Hugo Lloris, in my opinion third best goalkeeper in the world.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcPQqqxtIy8) He's also beautiful.

* Erik Lamela. He cost us £30m and has/had huge potential. However, he's been largely disappointing.

* [Nabil Bentaleb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTeys7Y6qzw). Son of previous manager Tim Sherwood. Hugely promising midfielder who only just turned twenty. Came through our youth academy.

* [Harry Kane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XTtPGCVBsQ). Our lord and saviour. Plays as a striker, he came from our youth academy and is a legend. Scores goals, rapes world class defenders, works hard for the full ninety, [and can even play as goalkeeper.
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbhBuZGIm4g)

* Roberto Soldado. £26m striker. Doesn't score.

Also, bear in mind that we had many defensive culpabilities at the beginning of last season - the 4-3 game at Sunderland springs to mind. Our impeccable defensive record towards the tail end of last season gives the impression we were superb throughout; we weren't.

Furthermore, a facet of Courtois' game is how quickly he comes out to gather high balls. Criticise him for conceding a lot of goals, but he flat out prevents attacking players from goalscoring opportunities with the sheer number of crosses and corners he gathers; he's quite simply the best in the world at it. In that respect, Cech was extremely culpable, especially after his head injuries. Look at the line we keep from indirect free kicks: it's generally out of the box, and Courtois is perched at the edge of his 6 yard box ready to collect.

Also you need to use a moisturiser. Even if you have oily skin. This is a misconception by many; they think they don't need it as their skin is oily, but you do! This is a basic routine, so start with that, then if you're not happy, you can add a chemical exfoliant such as an AHA or BHA. Also you should use mineral oil (I use Johnsons first touch as it has no fragrance in) which helps smooth your skin and helps with the dry patches!

null,false,solipsia,null,null,null,"Nutmeg is **very** expensive. I would recommend that you calculate how much you'll paying them and decide whether it's worth it for you.

Consider this: Let's assume Nutmeg gives the same return as investing directly in the underlying trackers (this is what they do after all). Let's say that you get 4.5% growth per annum with them. Now compare that do investing yourself in an equivalent index tracker with the same return. With their 1.5% fee, you will end up paying them ~40% of your profits over 10 years. Staying with them for 35 years (let's saying saving for retirement), Nutmeg would cost you **more than half of your profits**. 

Calculation:

    Profit by self-investing (A) = Principal *((1+growth rate)^years -1) 
    Profit with Nutmeg (B) = Principal *((1+growth rate with Nutmeg - Nutmeg fee)^years -1)
    % profits lost due to Nutmeg's fees = (A-B)/A

Stick in whatever assumptions you want to make and see what a huge slice of your profits you are giving up. These are wildly simplistic assumptions, but the concept is solid. Of course this subscribes to the notion that managed funds don't consistently outperform the market - which is something I believe in.

Furthermore, there have been plenty of cases of very young children engaging in consensual sex (see RvG for one hell of a horror story - ~11 yr old boy convicted properly as a child rapist for having consensual sex with a ~12 year old).  
  
Also, the nature of the crimes very much implies that there was consent. You would expect prosecution under S1 or S3 if there was no consent. I think? It's been a while since I studied this.  
  
Also, getting technical only the girl can have been raped.  
  
Skipping the semantics - the law requires that one is the victim and the other the perpetrator. You can't commit a crime by having a crime perpetrated against you. (see a whole host of funky case law).

Acids for example are not generally the recommended method of exfoliating since they are irritants. Also massage and rubbing should be minimised so OCM/ double cleansing is unwise.

Not really 'forgotten'...

Spain and the UK had a treaty allowing continued British use of part of the island; https://web.archive.org/web/20080616211516/http://www.history.horizon.co.fk/articles/1771decs.html

The UK had to leave the islands soon after due to some uppity Brits with ideas of grandeur in British North America. However it left items on the island as to not relinquish its claim. The UK also continued to use the islands for various commercial activities. These items were forcibly removed soon later by Spain illegally.

Thus Spain had no right to give anyone the islands.

null,false,Firefox7275,null,null,null,"Welcome! Questions .... Which rosacea subtype, and are you prescribed anything for it? Are you using a broad spectrum sunscreen at present? Are you consistently meeting or exceeding ALL our government's recommendations for healthy eating?

If you feel overwhelmed TBH I would research in bitesize chunks maybe even taking brief notes as you do in your studies. You should only patch test and introduce one new product at a time anyway so you have all the time in the world. There is a lot to understand about rosacea - I've posted piles of highly relevant articles on /r/rosaceahelp/ - whilst I am happy to post what I know here but that would simply end up as multiple overwhelming essays. 

You will actually get much better value for money considering online as well for your 'treatment products' and no that does not mean going high end. By all means use the high street (I like Superdrug and Asda) for really basic stuff like cleansers and moisturisers. Boots tends to be expensive except when branded products are half price, and frankly the anti ageing stuff on the high street is seriously underwhelming ingredients wise.

Aside from sunscreen the 'holy trinity' of anti ageing ingredients is arguably a retinoid, vitamin C and niacinamide. All three are in our ingredients Wiki and we have mega-review threads in the sidebar for retinoids and niacinamide (vitamin C is soon to come). I have rosacea myself and am the wrong side of 40 so am reviewing products with those two 'hats on'. High street retinoids tend to be outrageously expensive and/ or too weak for anti ageing, high street vitamin C tends to be the wrong pH or far too low a percentage.

You don't say which of the Simple foaming washes, but the Refreshing version has a good chance of being suited to your skintype, it is sulphate free and has a short ingredients list. However you may be best using this once daily and an emulsifying oil or rich cream cleanser the other time - this will better shift sunscreen and make up. Wipes are pretty poor for this.

It is not always necessary to cleanse twice daily since we do not get 'dirty' overnight and it may be counterproductive. Gentle toners or gentle wipes are useful for very light cleanses, overwetting or soaking the skin can aggravate sensitivity/ reactivity, and overusing foaming products can damage the skin barrier and further dehydrate skin.

No the UK understood the Argentinian government was a brutal regimes that had little concern for the lives of its own people or the Falkland islanders, the deal was to try and protect the islanders from an Argentina invasion that the UK wasn't entire sure it would be able to stop.

The deal was to try and prevent armed conflict and lost of life but Argentina rejected it and decided to go to war instead, the war is over now Argentina lost and there unprovoked invasion was stopped, and the people who lives the deal would have saved are now dead. 

Given those lives have now been lost and it is now clear Argentina doesn't have the military capacity to take the islands by force, what have the Falkland islanders got to gain by giving tribute to the country that murdered there countrymen without provocation?",null,0,null,1420222073,null,0,1420223098,0,cncb97n,null,t3_2r216c,null,t1_cncb97n,null,t1_cnc0uji,null,null,null,1425098034,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Wank Week.

A season of television programmes about masturbation, called Wank Week, was to be broadcast in the United Kingdom by Channel 4 in March 2007. The first show was about a Masturbate-a-thon, a public mass masturbation event, organised to raise money for the sexual health charity Marie Stopes International. Another film would have focused on compulsive male masturbators and a third was to feature the sex educator Dr Betty Dodson.

The series came under public attack from senior television figures, and was pulled amid claims of declining editorial standards and controversy over the channel's public service broadcasting credentials.[16] However, the films it was meant to showcase may yet be broadcast by the channel at a later date.

Read back the threads on the scandal, or any thread containing the word pedophile, it's horrifying, every thread has people arguing why these people are innocent.

Cliff Richard's name is on a guest list of a known pedophile brothel, and everyone jumps to defend him when his house gets raided...

I would love to be able to say we can stay quiet and let the police get on with their job and this will all be solved.. 

Unfortunately way too many important people are involved here, so it won't be;

&gt;Simon Danczuk said a Conservative minister stepped in to warn him not to name Lord Brittan in a Parliamentary committee last week.

&gt;“’I hear you’re about to challenge Lord Brittan about when he knew about child sex abuse,’ he said. ‘It wouldn’t be a wise move', he advised me. 'It was all put to bed a long time ago.’

&gt;Mr Danczuk said that members of the Home Affairs select committee received similar phone calls ahead of his appearance on Tuesday.

[Source - Telegraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/10949366/Simon-Danczuk-I-was-warned-not-to-challenge-Leon-Brittan-over-paedophile-dossier.html)


Also[ watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-cM9ZrDkdE) of Simon Danczuk giving evidence at the Home Affair Committee, he is talking about the biggest paedophile scandal in British history, but when he attempts to say politics is the last place where child sex abuse is covered up... They all defend the idea that that's ever happened. Despite it literally being a trial about that fucking happening. 

This video shows someone presenting huge amounts of evidence about this paedophile ring, and is being told that;

""A formal enquiry would be irresponsible because it might raise the hopes of the victims""

They also talk about how the victims need ""closure"" as another reason the investigation shouldn't happen, along with ""it's unfair to the victims"". 

Truly one of the most shocking videos I've watched recently, and nobody fucking cares. 

Nobody cares that there was a pro-paedophile activist group funded £400,000 by the government, with senior MPs as members (Sir Peter Hayman).. Yes, he's got a fucking knighthood.

I've generally found food and nights out to be similar in price, Dundee sometimes creeping more expensive believe it or not (Papa Joes, Agacan etc all charging a hefty sum). I take the car on a night out or yes, I would get shafted for cab fare where I live. 

I can't just walk to the shops and get my messages now either, have to drive to a big supermarket. In Dundee, I always wandered along to Tesco Riverside and either walked back or got a taxi if it was a huge shop. Definitely need a car in Edinburgh.

Whilst not everyone is triggered by the same things, there is a lot of massage, hot water and wiping in standard OCM. All three of these dermatology experts recommend limiting or avoiding so it's important not to go against that.

If you want to recommend OCM to other rosaceans maybe suggest the modified form - use of emulsifiers, short 'soaks' and very brief massage, rinse with tepid water only, hands or a super soft cloth not a regular flannel, no double cleansing.

One of the reasons OCM is believed to lead to improvements in skin where there is hypersensitivity or a damaged barrier function is what the user gives up - harsh scrubs, harsh anionic surfactants - not simply what the user adds (OCM itself).

If you are referring to unclogging of open or closed comedones that is acne vulgaris not rosacea (the two can sometimes co-exist). No rosacea subtype is characterised by clogged pores.

null,false,StinkyKlinky,null,null,null,"Great thread idea, this has been a rough season. I think we have one obvious weakness (defense) and our best defenseman our out (McCarthy, Stones). Positive things from the Hull match.

Barkley and Coleman are beating defenders off the dribble. This is what gives our attack speed. If they beat a man it creates a numerical advantage. There were 3-5 good runs from the match I would like to see gifs of. Including a should have been goal from Barkley.

Baines' play in the middle. His ability to make a good through ball from deep, takes advantage of Mirallas and Lukaku's best attributes. As a one on one defender (LB) he is starting to slip a little, still competent but he does have flaws. However he is pretty good at breaking up passes and his tackling is solid, he is very good at closing down the man. He was the only one continuously pressing Hull in the 80th+. On a side note a little tangent on  Baines. This is why he is one of my all time favorites. I can't think of a more model professional. He doesn't tackle dirty but he plays hard every time. He will run for the full 90. When he gets tackled, he doesn't go rolling around making it seem worse than it is. Constantly acknowledging when it was a fine foul.

I think this will change RM's tactics and line up. He has to know that the 4-2-3-1 is not working and we are not better with Barry on the pitch. My ideal line up would be something like this:



Coleman   Stones  Jagielka   Baines

     MCcCarthy  Barkley   Besic  
     Lukaku     Naismith   Mirallas (In this formation he has to play D)

or Chainge it Up:


   Stones   Jagielka  ALcaraz/Barry
 
 Coleman  McCarthy/Besic  Barkley  Baines  Oviedo
              
Lukaku     Mirallas

*National Express Bus* (http://www.nationalexpress.com/home.aspx)

If you're traveling from London to Liverpool and have some time and/or want to save money, consider taking a National Express bus. We were able to get tickets for £9/person, and the bus took about six hours. Not the most luxurious way to travel, but it was nice to save a few bucks on an already expensive trip.

**Where to Stay**

*HOAX Hostel* (http://hoaxliverpool.com/)

This is a great spot for people on the younger end, it's right on Matthews Street, a popular going out spot. It's also a short walk away from Concert Square, another fun spot with a few bars and clubs. The hostel is very clean and provided us with everything we wanted (towels, internet, and a private room for a group of six).

Mathew Street can be pretty loud until late at night, so I wouldn't recommend it if that's the sort of thing that will bother you. Also, it's not particularly close to the stadium.

*Malmaison Hotel* (https://www.malmaison.com/locations/liverpool/)

Everton USA members get a discount here.

**Getting to the Game**

*Soccerbus*

From any Merseyrail ticket place (most likely one in Liverpool City Centre) just ask for a ticket to Goodison and you'll get a Soccerbus ticket included. You don't need to get it included, but it's cheaper than if you just got a train ticket and then paid for the bus at the bus.

**Gameday Experience**

For Americans – beer is not allowed in the stands, so make sure you get your drinks in beforehand!

*The Winslow* (https://plus.google.com/112461334509457383697/about?gl=us&amp;hl=en)

*The Brick* (https://plus.google.com/116411374806321116387/about?gl=us&amp;hl=en)

**Getting Tickets/Where to Sit**

For Americans – the easiest way to go about this is to join Everton USA (http://evertonusa.net/) and buy tickets through there.

Other alternatives include StubHub (pricey but easy) or asking a season ticket holder to buy for you.

*Family Enclosure*

Pretty self-explanatory.

*Gwladys End*

The Gwladys End is known for being where the ""hardcore"" fans sit. Expect to stand for a large portion of the game – during the second half, when Everton is playing towards the Gwladys End, it's customary to stand whenever the ball gets into the attacking half. Also, be prepared to sing because there will be a lot of that going on. It's definitely not the best place to bring young children (there was some angry shouting, although nothing too offensive), but I found everybody I spoke with to be friendly and welcoming.

Some views may be obstructed, although this usually isn't as bad as it sounds. Typically, you're only ""obstructed"" from a tiny part of the pitch (e.g. a few feet along the endline), a problem that can frequently be rectified by just leaning a bit.

If you're going with people who aren't Everton supporters, I'd recommend telling them to either cheer for Everton or stay quiet if you do choose to sit in the Gwladys End. I don't think the Gwladys End is the right place for a neutral fan, although I suppose it's mildly acceptable if they're accompanying an Everton supporter.

*Main Stand*

Pretty shit atmosphere, but there's a lot kids here. It's also pretty steep, so you lose that 'someone behind you is screaming vibe.' Not too many singers and not too many conversations. Good view, but you almost feel too far away to communicate.

*Park End*

A little bit dearer and not as rowdy, but no restricted views anywhere. Also, if you're sat in PE5, 6 or 7, you get to give away fans some stick as you're right next to them.Gladys Street: fucking fantastic if we're doing well. Everyone in here seems to believe if we cross the halfway line with the ball, it's going in the fucking goal. The players know this as well, so the corners are fantastic places to see players up close. They will love any American or new fan. They'll love telling you why we are shit as well. Pretty great view, but hard to see the opposite goal (but the best to see goals at your end)

It's okay! They get involved in chants if they're circulating, but it's very family orientated, so it's a bit flaccid. A lot of taking about the team, but feels a bit pointless.

*Bullens Road*

I've had some of the best conversations about Everton in this stand. Fantastic if you're a regular, terrible if you're a newbie. Great view, if you can get the tickets.

**What to do in Liverpool**

*Everton Two at Liverpool ONE* (http://www.liverpool-one.com/store_profile.aspx?retailername=EvertonTwo)

Official team store with a fantastic name.

*The Fab Four Taxi Tour* (http://www.thebeatlesfabfourtaxitour.com)

An absolute must for Beatles fans. Your group gets its own taxi and tour guide and you see many important Beatles sites, including the childhood homes of Paul, John, George, and Ringo, Strawberry Fields, Penny Lane, etc. The taxi can pick you up anywhere in the city and can even drop you off near Goodison (although you have to pay slightly extra for that, as Goodison is outside the city center). It's a little pricier than other Beatles tours, but the convenience of getting picked up at your hotel, the luxury of essentially having a private tour, and the ability for the car to drive directly up to most of the sites (as opposed to a bus, where you sometimes have to get out a few blocks away) make it worth it.

*Maritime Museum* (http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/maritime/)

*Mathew Street*

Great area for nightlife, including the Cavern Club (based on the original Cavern Club where the Beatles played).

*Concert Square*

It's a the US president having an affair right before the election, so a PR team is hired to make him look good again. They come to the conclusion that the only way to make him look good again is for people to focus on something else, so they start a fake war in Albania. There is no war at all, but they fake shots from the war and release them to newschannels and when they ""win"" the war the president is hailed as a hero and reelected. 

The Falklands war was more or less a failed attempt at this. To gain public approval and to redirect focus from children being kidnapped by the military etc. they started this campaign to retake the Malvinas. What is the deal after all? The Britts don't need islands all the way over in South America. 

Well, what they did was that they actually went to war (not faking it), they lost the war horribly (huge casualties for inhospitable islands) and instead of gaining public support for themselves they probably got Thatcher reelected.

The most important thing here that I'm trying to get out of writing this, is that people realise that there are people actively trying to stop an investigation into this happening. The police are perfectly capable of running their investigation, and don't need the public getting involved. However I feel it's important for people to realise just how much evidence is actually out there, and to ensure that there is public pressure to conduct a full investigation, the talk of ""not doing an investigation because it's unfair to the victims"" to me is quite frankly terrifying.

In 1982, the police raided Elm Guest House. They found 12 underage boys on the premises, who testified that they were sexually abused by house guests. The owner was charged with running a brothel - but no charges of child abuse were pressed, nor were any of the guests prosecuted.

 Link: http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/special-report-police-revisit-the-grim-mystery-of-elm-guest-house-8420435.html

Press coverage at the time - http://i.imgur.com/E4zI1cm.jpg


The owners of the brothel, Haroon Kasir &amp; Carole Kasir were being paid by Spartacus pedophile network to host ‘parties’

(On 16th July 2013 Haroon Kasir was arrested again on Child porn offences)


Spartacus claimed to be a gay club, but they were exposed by Sunday People magazine as a pedophile club posing as a gay club http://i.imgur.com/Wf3hTdb.jpg


Guardian article from 1984 referring to Spartacus as “the inter national paedophile information network”

In 1986 The Sunday Times ran a story exposing Spartacus called “ Scandal of Britons who buy young boys for £3 a night”

The existence of a list of guests to Elm Guest House was disclosed by Peter McKelvie.

Mr McKelvie, a retired child protection team manager who has spent more than 20 years compiling evidence of alleged abuse by authority figures, said he believed there was enough evidence to arrest at least one senior politician.

Mr McKelvie, helped bring the notorious paedophile Peter Righton to justice in 1992.


“I believe there are sufficient grounds to carry out a formal investigation into allegations of up to 20 MPs and Lords over the last three to four decades, some still alive and some dead. The list is there.”


Liberal MP Cyril Smith, who is one of the alleged pedophiles, has been confirmed by the police as a guest of this establishment. Link: http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-manchester-24074818[2]


The rest of the list includes the following names;

&gt; Anthony Blunt, Royal Connections, MI5, traitor, Russian spy deceased.

&gt; Harvey Proctor, Monday Club, well known convicted paedophile.

&gt; Sir Peter Bottomley. Worthing MP and Monday Club

&gt; Charles Irving

&gt; Leon Britton, Lord, ex Thatcher Minister

&gt; Peter Brooke, Life Peer

&gt; John Rowe, MI5, former MP

&gt; Cyril Smith, deceased, ex Rochdale MP

&gt; Ron Brown

&gt; Colin Jordan, Politician and author

&gt; George Tremlett, Former GLC Leader

&gt; Peter Campbell, Monday Club

&gt; Gary Walker, Sinn Fein

&gt; Cliff Richard,aged Pop Star, known at Elm Guest House as ‘Kitty’

&gt; Jess Conrad, aged ex Pop Star.

&gt; Ron Wells, aged Musician, aka ‘Gladys’ at Elm Guest House.

&gt; Richard Miles, Monday Club

More info:



In 1983, a Conservative MP named Geoffrey Dickens compiled a detailed record of child abuse within parliament which he told his family would be a massive scandal. He gave it to the Home Secretary Leon Brittan, who claimed it would be given to the police - it never was, and the file was lost. Link: http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-manchester-24074818

Wikipedia - Westminster paedophile dossier 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_paedophile_dossier


114 files relating to child abuse claims between 1979 and 1999 have been destroyed or lost by the Home Office

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/10950563/Former-chair-of-Paedophile-Information-Exchange-claims-he-hid-material-in-locked-cabinets-at-the-Home-Office.html


Leon Brittan is also on the guest list for Elm House.

Here's a very good Channel 4 news bit on this missing dossier, and Leon Brittan's ever-changing story

Witness testaments:


Speaking to the BBC, one of the alleged victims claimed that ""senior military and political figures"" had been involved in the abuse of youngsters in the 1970s and 1980s.

The man, who is now in his 40s and whose identity has been protected, claimed he had been regularly abused by a gang between 1975 and 1984.

He said he was one of between 15 and 20 children, who would be picked up in cars and taken to hotels and apartments, where they were physically and sexually abused.

He said: ""They were very powerful people and they controlled my life for the next nine years. They created fear that penetrated every part of me, day in day out. You didn't question what they wanted, you did as they asked without question and the punishments were very severe.""



The man's claims are understood to be *among a number* now being assessed by the Metropolitan Police.

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/11231088/Westminster-paedophile-ring-investigated-over-murder-links.html


There are also witness testaments available on this channel, some of the detailed descriptions are very difficult to listen to

The beginning dialouge is not flattering for Nick Clegg;

Bill Maloney confronts Nick Clegg and shouts ;

&gt;“4 years ago I asked you what you were going to do about institutionalised  pedophile rings operating in this country, your reply to me was ”I don’t know what you mean“ do you know what I mean now?”

To which Nick Clegg replies

You're getting a lot of 'feelings' on the matter and not much factual evidence. So if you don't mind, a new post!

Your arguments;

&gt;The Falklands sits on the same continental shelf as South America, therefore SA nations should be allowed some income from resources near and on The Falklands. (""I count the malvinas/falkland islands, as part of the patagonian shelf, territory of argentina, or at least of south america"")

This is similar to a situation Britain saw to progress, despite there being no legal requirement for it to do so (honestly at that point the UK gave no shits about such a remote place). However the Argentine Government of the time refused, given its aim was complete annexation. You've said that it would be nice to return to this discussion. However unfortunately it is now too late for that, given the attempted invasion. The UK just cannot do this politically any longer, and still, has no legal requirement to do so.

But proximity, based on being on same shelf, is a legal basis for a claim to *rights* provided there is no legal competing claim and that a state can scientifically prove the shelf is the same. Thus you see no Caribbean nation has exploitation rights for the entire Caribbean sea. The only time proximity of the same shelf would give automatic rights is when the land is not settled adequately nor elsewhere claimed. If it were not the case, nations such as Australia of the 1900s, would have previously given rights to nearby Indonesian for resources it had. Similarly the USA would be able to claim income from Bermuda.

No where else in the world, does proximity to a territory provide the legal basis for financial extraction from it. The UN however does provide an Economic Exclusive Zone about 200miles from the coast. As demonstrated here;

https://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/ibru/south_atlantic_maritime_claims.pdf

...only a very small part of the Falklands EEZ and Argentine EEZ overlaps and is thus in dispute.

Now the situation gets a bit messier when it comes to exploration and extraction rights beyond the 200Mtr EEZ. Rights determined by the UN CLCS. Of which both the UK and Argentina can use their legal presence on the shelf in order to exert claims on the surrounding area.

The problem is, nor the UK nor Argentina have much more of a legal CLCS claim than the other when it comes to disputed areas within this zone. It matters not to the UN whether the Falklands are sovereign in this instance, just merely where they are and who owns them. The UNCLCS, as far as I know, has yet to make a judgement on any claim, anywhere. Leading in many instances for states to come to their own agreements rather than wait (i.e. Bangladesh v India).

&gt;The islands should be demilitarized

Believe me. The British Government would love to do this. However there are British citizens on the islands which face realistic military threat from Argentina. While this is the case, the presence cannot be removed. Britain doesn't just put a massive military presence in places for no real reason.

&gt;Having a military base so close to us that might or might not be hostile in future wars scares me a bit to be honest.

The UK has no real interest in South American military affairs. You should be far more concerned about Brazil.

&gt;The Falklands resources should be shared, as it isn't a sovereign state. It should therefore be South Americas based on being on the same continental shelf and as Argentina is the closest, Argentinas specifically.

I am confused as to why you believe sovereignty confers some sort of automatic grant of rights to the people which would otherwise be excluded. Nations have for hundreds of years had their peoples placed elsewhere on the globe, sometimes sovereign, often not. French Guiana exists within South America itself and is part of the EU, yet I do not see calls from South American nations to annex it.

The UK would grant the Falklanders sovereignty if they wanted it. However just because they don't, doesn't mean they have any less of a right to their island or the resources around it.

You then get the northern line train (from Moorfields or Central) to Sandhills and get the bus from there.


As for what to do in Liverpool, there's lots to do. My favourite place to go is the [Maritime museum](http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/maritime/) but that might not be your cup of tea. There's also pleeeeeenty to do if you're a Beatles fan.  
And you'll want to drop by Everton 2 at Liverpool 1, even if it's just for a giggle at the address. 


When I used to go see Everton with my dad, I'm pretty sure we sat near the corner which was a pretty good view. Can't remember exactly where.
I'll be able to tell you my opinion of where I'm sitting in the Main Stand on Tuesday night after.

&gt;

&gt;___Man Down___ is a British sitcom first broadcast on Friday 18 October 2013  on [Channel 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_4) and starring [Greg Davies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Davies) as Dan, a man who hates his job as a teacher,  and [Rik Mayall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rik_Mayall) as his father in the first series.

&gt;Channel 4 commissioned an additional 25 minute Christmas special before the first series aired,  and a second series was announced during Davies's live tour ""The Back of My Mum's Head"", though this was prior to [Rik Mayall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rik_Mayall)'s death in June 2014. Following Mayall's death, Davies met with Channel 4, to discuss the future of the show (Mayall had been intended to have a more a prominent role in season 2).  However on 28 November 2014, Channel 4 announced that *Man Down* would return for a second Christmas special on 23 December 2014 with a second series due to follow in 2015.

Now I'd agree with you about the trial's secret nature, but I'd say that also applies to the family courts, but that's having some genuinely devastating effects on peoples' lives.

I heard of one case where someone was prevented from visiting her elderly parent, because she was in dispute with the council, saying the parent shouldn't have been taken into care. The council claimed she was disruptive when visiting her parent in the care home, and banned her from the premises. 

Other family court cases - and this seems to happen with some regularly now - involve mothers being separated from their children shortly after birth.

Just like if a woman hits a man, there must be a reason. What did *he* do to make her mad?

While we're coming up with hypothetical scenarios, maybe an adult caught her doing something sexual, and then she made out that she was raped in order to save face or cause a distraction? It happens a lot with kids, it's a common tactic. (not the rape part but the distraction technique)

Look, I agree we can't make assumptions, but what we have here is one person that is above the age of criminal responsibility and one that is not. There is a reason for having the age of criminal responsibility in the first place. So the older child is definitely at fault unless they were forced somehow into it.

Don't you see that a 13-16 year old is much more developed than an 8 year old? That definitely counts for something when you consider this. If you don't think it counts, then I think you are making an error.

If you're going to do it anyway: http://england.shelter.org.uk/get_advice/repairs_and_bad_conditions/tenants_repairs_and_improvements/tenants_doing_repairs

Also if whoever you choose fucks it up you're liable.

Unfortunately whilst the landlord might not be living up to their side of the agreement, that doesn't mean OP can break his (to pay the full rent amount)

OP: What does your tenancy agreement say about repairs?

null,false,ninetyfables,null,null,null,"Whereabouts in Scotland are you? Have a look at average rents in your area. Look at professional house shares or people wanting lodgers, depending on where you are, you could easily rent a room. By renting a room, or lodging, you then only have to pay a smaller proportion of any household bills. I reckon your £200 a month bursary should cover this amount, depending on where you are. 

Next thing to do would be to find a part time job. I say part time, because I feel like full time studying and full time work on top of that would drain you. It would be counter productive in terms of getting your work done as well. It's not worth it. I kept a 18hr part time job on top of full time study, and that was more than enough. I work full time now and I know I couldn't study around that. A part time shop/office/bar job of around 16-25 hours will bring you in a good chunk of money per month, say anything between £300-£700 a month. Enough to pay any extra rent your bursary may not cover and all other living costs. 

Print your CV off and hand it in at some local bars, shops, cafés. Part time work as a general rule, is it a bit easier to find than full time.

Since your dad didn't qualify for Chinese citizenship when Hong Kong was handed back to China and he wasn't yet a US citizen, it applied to him too. It gets him a passport and a slightly easier route to full British citizenship, but not much else. It can't be passed on to your children.

That probably leaves an ancestry visa through your grandparents as the best option. That gets you five years in the UK, after which you can apply for indefinite leave to remain, and then naturalisation.

If you were born before 1997 then I suppose you'd have been a British Dependent Territories Citizen by descent, making you British Overseas Citizen too.

I don't know anybody who's attempted to do both at the same time, but I know a fair few who've worked full time and studied part time or studied full time and worked part time, and many of them felt they were stretched to their limit with hobbies and socialising as well.

Put it this way:  Let's assume you sleep eight hours per day, and spend a total of four hours per day on things like personal hygiene, cooking and eating, and housework.  That leaves you with 12 hours per day, or 84 hours per week.  Full time study is usually considered to be around 30 hours per week all told, and let's say your full time job is 40 hours per week including breaks, making a total of 70 hours working or studying every week.  That leaves you with 14 hours per week, or 2 hours per day of free time, assuming you live right next to both your place of study and your job.

However, houseshares, even if they're not student houseshares, are available all year around.  Bear in mind though, that while students are exempt from paying council tax, your housemates may not be, and they will expect you to pay your share.  Some student houseshares in the private sector do have September-September leases though, often with a reduced rate during the summer; after all, if nobody's paying rent, the landlord isn't making any money.

Either way, my best suggestion would be to consider a student loan.  While I realise you don't want to take on any debt, unlike private debt, student loan repayments are tied to your income, meaning that you'll never not be able to afford to pay.  Student loans also don't appear on a credit report, so they won't affect your ability to get other finance in the future.  If you do need to borrow money, student loans are definitely the best (or least bad) way to do it.  If you get a part time job as well and end up not spending any or part of the loan, you can just pay that amount back when you graduate and start working.

The other option is to hang on and wait until September to move out of your parents' house, and work every hour you can during the summer, saving the money to make up the shortfall.  That relies quite heavily on you finding suitable work during the summer though, and you could end up having to go the loan route anyway.",null,0,null,1420229098,null,0,false,0,cncf8a7,null,t3_2r4lri,null,t1_cncf8a7,null,t3_2r4lri,null,null,null,1425096110,null,14,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,14,null

null,false,notsoyoungpadawan,null,null,null,"OK, let me elaborate on why this trend has occurred this season. We don't play a 4-2-3-1. Well, do on paper, yes, but we actually play a 3-4-2-1. Ivanovic plays as a wing-back and Azpi plays as a very fluid version of a CB; the type Van Gaal wanted at UTD when he signed Rojo. Terry has become a sweeper and you rarely see him making forward runs like he did during the last few years.

So, is this new formation the reason behind why we're conceding more goals? Partially. The problem is that Cahill is left too exposed, and this has also been one of the reasons behind his bad form this year.  Last year we played two proper DMs in front of our CBs, and the formation was quite rigid in that sense, and both CBs were protected because both wings were protected. When Ivanovic was caught out, we had Ramires - who has amazing speed to recover - come back and cover Cahill. When Luiz played you could tell that he had specific instructions not to bomb forward because he had no pace if he got caught out. Unfortunately it didn't always work, but it did for most of the matches. Now you'll often see Cahill defending in right-back positions, which is a CB's nightmare. He has the pace but not the agility to mark a good winger.

This season, with Fabregas coming in there has been a slight imbalance. He isn't the quickest players, nor is he defence minded player. To compensate for that, Jose has asked Oscar to cover defensive positions when Cesc goes forward/gets caught out/etc. Oscar's performances have **severly** dipped in December, and everyone knows why. We no longer see him covering the same amount of ground as he did earlier in the season and fatigue is definitely starting to seep into some of these players.

As expected, Jose brought on Ramires instead of Oscar at HT to bring back that pace in defensive areas and to give Cahill some support. But unfortunately it was a bit too late with us already being 3 goals down. 

So trust me when I say that Zouma is not nearly ready to be able to hold down the fort on his own. Cahill has always been an above average defender and never world-class. We **need** someone like Varane in this team to be completely solid defensively, and I believe Jose will try and move for him in the summer, if not this winter transfer window.",null,0,null,1420229480,null,0,1420240740,0,cncfg02,null,t3_2r44hw,null,t1_cncfg02,null,t3_2r44hw,null,null,null,1425096010,null,14,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,14,null

Lacking the body and the weapon, and the guy was found not guilty, it just looks like the police and the CPS were trying it on because they ""knew he did it"". I understand the desire for justice, but the evidence has got to be there.

Meanwhile the principle of double-jepoardy was absolute. There was never before a grey area, or any room for *what if*s - if you'd been tried and found not guilty, then you'd been proved innocent in the eyes of the law, at least to the extent you could put it behind you and never have to worry about it again.

You certainly make a good point about safeguards, but those do tend to erode. Perhaps I'd be more in favour of this if there was a third verdict - that besides *guilty* and *not guilty*, the jury could declare that you'd been *proved innocent*, and CPS could never come after you again.

I guess if you think that the police always know what they're doing, and they're always sure when they go to court, then your position makes sense.
