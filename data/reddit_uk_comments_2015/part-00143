Sounds dumb, but that's the law.

They think it's safe to dive into a 4ft shallow end thinking the water will slow them down. People go above 6ft and that's almost the exact point poor swimmers begin to struggle and drown.

But should they be?

A studio seems likely to contribute more to the local economy than a storage barn. And no more of an eyesore. Maybe a few more cars visiting per day. Noise? Possibly? But compared to farm machinery?

Green belts are primarily about restricting development to pump up house prices (by inflating land prices).

We're not talking about 'areas of outstanding natural beauty' here, area we. Just land that has not been slowly given over to development.

Housing costs are crippling to the younger generations. We need to make it much easier for the people to build homes and businesses. But oh dear, MPs will risk losing lose money on their overpriced taxpayer-funded properties if house prices fall...

Beforehand we had a shared astro pitch with the school next door, a massive disused field owned by some government agency which the school decided to use, another large field (I think 2 rugby pitches or so) on the other side of the school, and a few random courtyards within the school grounds, and a tarmac ""cage"", the size of 2 tennis courts.

Now, there's still the astro pitch and massive disused field, but also a new all-weather hockey pitch, and a new ""show-pitch"" (predominantly for rugby). There's still the old field at the back of the school but it's smaller now.

null,false,almodozo,null,null,null,"&gt;Well, who do you think does represent mainstream feminism? Who are the feminist thinkers I should be reading?

Good questions, really. I dunno. I was probably presumptuous claiming to know who are, or aren't ""leaders"" - but fundamentally, I don't think there are any. And haven't been for a while. Not even sure there's a feminist movement, as such, at least with the connotations the word ""movement"" has with at least relatively solidified organizational structures and a clear, common agenda and so on? Seems like it's more like what LimitlessLTD says: ""a group of people that shares a similar ideology"". And even that ideology has become very broad and heterogenous. 

Not that that's necessarily a bad thing, but it means you can't really judge it on the work of a couple of on-and-off columnists.

Prefacing this with the observation that I'm really not informed enough to talk about this (but when has the ever stopped anyone on Reddit), I don't think that feminist ideology ""has become increasingly extremist,"" as you wrote in your other comment, I think it's more that it's splintered into many different directions. Which seems pretty typical for ideologies in our time - same is true for socialism etc. E.g.:

* Academic feminism has become increasingly dense and theoretical. I've tried reading some bell hooks and Judith Butler but found it hard to get through. But in terms of sophistication and nuance it's obviously a different universe from feminist CiF columns. Universities also don't look kindly on generalist work anymore; to get published and be taken seriously within their discipline academics face an insane pressure to specialize ever further - making it harder to produce work with any impact on the broader social debate. 

* Political feminism has gone mainstream. Talking about the US: when Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act as soon as he got into office, or when the Democrats tried to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act last year, those were women's rights fights. Senator Mikulski, who introduced both bills, also brought feminist academics into Congress to give presentations for her fellow Congress members, and has said that what she is doing is ""applied feminism.""

* Even the corporate world has coopted some feminist sheen - the ""Lean In"" business and all that. 

* Grassroots feminism has black feminists in the US, for example, focusing on issues like police brutality and mass incarceration, and the impact discrimination and exclusion have on black women - concrete and hard-hitting subjects. And they've taken some swipes at the unreflexive, privileged white middle-class perspectives of their fellow feminists while they're at it.

* And in the meantime you have the college and Tumblr feminists making memes and decrying micro-aggressions, in addition to tackling (in my privileged-male eyes more important-seeming) issues like sexual violence on campuses. 

That's my superficial impression of the landscape, anyway. And it's not necessarily that these things conflict with each other, it's just that their protagonists almost seem to exist and act in separated universes. And maybe because the academic feminist thinkers have kind of retreated into the ivory tower, and the feminist politicians focus on the unspectacular sausage-making business that is lawmaking, the stuff you're most likely to come across browsing blogs and online newspaper columns (and other stuff Reddit links to) is the CiF/Tumblr-type stuff. And of course it doesn't hurt that the likes of Salon love to publish that stuff because of its massive link bait value.

That doesn't make it representative for feminism overall, but also means that there might not be clear ""leaders"" to easily point to as alternative. But this kind of segmented splintering seems to have happened within most ideologies.",null,0,null,1429214097,null,0,1429216878,0,cqeomh5,null,t3_32sil5,null,t1_cqeomh5,null,t1_cqeip2p,null,null,null,1432431038,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

It's good that he's farming it out to people who specialize in UK politics this time, but their predictions don't seem to be that far away from anyone else who is having a go - even [UK Polling Report's very simple uniform swing model](http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/ukpr-projection-2) isn't that far out.  I found it a little bit annoying how much praise Silver got for correctly predicting the last US presidential election with his absurdly complicated model, when virtually everyone else was predicting the exact same results (IIRC, some sites simply averaged the last few polls in each state and correctly predicted all 50 of them).",null,0,null,1429214713,null,0,false,0,cqep10t,null,t3_32slii,null,t1_cqep10t,null,t3_32slii,null,null,null,1432431228,null,1,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,1,null

It includes routine maternity care (not only because of illness or an accident), as long as you're not going abroad to give birth. However, if the birth happens unexpectedly, the card will cover the cost of all medical treatment for mother and baby that is linked to the birth.
The card covers the provision of oxygen and kidney dialysis, although you will have to arrange and pre-book these treatments before you go on holiday. You can ask your GP or hospital for advice, but make sure you are not booked with a private healthcare provider, as these are not covered by the EHIC.
The card also covers routine medical care for people with pre-existing conditions that need monitoring.

You can use it in a nursery or, if you can find a childminder who can accept it you can use it there as well. Be aware that some nurseries have set times when you can use the 15 hours. All children aged 3 and four are entitled to it from the start of the term that follows their 3rd birthday. 

As for the younger ones, some nurseries do offer discounts if you have more than one child attending, but not everywhere sadly. Plus many nurseries start at 2 or 3 years so you may find your options limited. 

Your local council will probably have a children's information service. Mine have a team of childcare brokers who will do all the phoning for you and have a full list of all the options in each area. I use a childminder. She charges £4 an hour and is registered to accept the 15 hours as well. All childminders are checked by Ofsted and the reports are publicly available. As with all childcare options some are better than others, mine for instance takes my son on trips and does educational activities with him every session. However if she is off sick or on holiday I am stuck, which is not something that happens with nurseries. 

There are also playgroups. These tend to be in church halls etc and run for a limited number of hours a day. I'm not sure about the detail of nannies / au pairs so can't help you there.

Back when taxes were up at 75% there were fuckloads of business owners who offshored because they came to the conclusion that they'd paid their fair share and now people were *just getting greedy*.

Someone on £200k loses their tax free allowance, and is on 40-45%.
Someone on £20k has a tax-free allowance and pays 20%.

[In 2015-16](http://www.listentotaxman.com/200000?yr=2015):

* Someone on £20k will lose 17% (£3.3k) of their income to tax and NI.
* Someone on £200k will lose 42% (£83.4k) of their income to tax and NI.

So, even as it is, those earning more pay more - not just in absolute terms (20% of £20k is 10x less than 20% of £200k) - but in relative terms. They not only contirbute more money, but a much larger proportion of their income. And of course they'll get stung even in death because they'll likely have a larger estate to leave their kids, which the government will jump all over as well (not sure why they get a second bite at the cherry having already taxed that money, but inheritance tax is another issue).

you can't debate the ideas without blocking people? Because that's much better than personal attacks (which you also engage in when it suits you) you seem to regularly block people who disagree with you which is interesting...

&gt; So how do critics of nuclear weapons get to a total figure of £100bn?

&gt; That includes the cost of running and servicing the submarines over a projected 40-year lifespan.

&gt; The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) has arrived at the round £100bn figure by two routes. One is to take the MoD's stated intention to spend 5-6% of its defence budget on running its nuclear deterrent.

&gt; CND estimates that at £2bn to £2.4bn per year, and multiplies by 40 - though, of course, defence budgets can go up or come down.

&gt; The different approach is a breakdown of costs. CND estimates £57bn in running costs, plus £13bn to decommission the submarines and weapons in the 2060s.

&gt; Add to that the upper end of estimates for building the submarines, at £26bn, and another £1bn for conventional military forces to protect them.

&gt; CND also adds more than £3bn for the cost of upgrading nuclear warheads and then replacing them in the 2030s.

&gt; That amount is disputed, because the MoD says the warhead and missile replacement costs are included in its overall procurement budget.",null,0,null,1429217298,null,0,false,0,cqeqqta,null,t3_32u5im,null,t1_cqeqqta,null,t1_cqeqgp8,null,null,null,1432432107,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

•	Ensure that spending on mental health care rises within our overall commitment to increase real spending on health.

•	Ensure that no one waits more than 28 days for access to talking therapies.

•	Ensure that everyone experiencing a mental health crisis, including children and young people, should have safe and speedy access to quality care, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

•	The use of police cells as ‘places of safety’ for children should be eliminated by 2016, and by the end of the next Parliament should only occur for adults in exceptional circumstances.

•	Ensure that everyone who requires a mental health bed should be able to access one in their local NHS Trust area, unless they need specialist care and treatment. If specialist care is required, then this should be provided within a reasonable distance of where the patient lives.

•	Implement a campaign to end the discrimination and stigma associated with mental health through supporting the Time for Change programme and offering employment support to those with mental health problems.

•	Invest in dementia services, ensuring that support is available for all affected by this debilitating disease, including families and carers.

•	Pay special attention to any mental health issues of mothers during and after pregnancy, children and adolescents, Black and Minority Ethnic people, refugees, the LGBTIQ communities and ex-service people and their families.

•	Improve access to addiction services, including both drugs and alcohol addiction.

•	Give higher priority to the physical healthcare of those with mental health problems.


EDIT: They also discuss creating an internet bill of rights as well

We would consider combining elements of the policies below into a comprehensive Digital Bill of Rights.
We would:

•	Oppose any case for secret unaccountable mass surveillance of the type exposed by Edward Snowden. We do accept that government law enforcement agencies may occasionally need to intercept communications in specific circumstances. Such specific surveillance should be proportionate, necessary, effective and within the rule of law, with independent judicial approval and genuine parliamentary oversight.

•	Replace the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, which has failed – to regulate the deployment of undercover police; – to support the confidentiality of journalistic sources; – to support legal confidentiality; and – to enshrine an open and effective right of redress.

•	Support and protect Internet freedom.

•	Follow human rights judgments limiting surveillance and data retention in full.

•	Support the EU’s proposals to strengthen data protection laws against opposition from large US data-driven companies.

•	Limit the censoring or takedown of content or activity to exceptional circumstances, clearly set out within a comprehensive legal framework.

•	Make copyright shorter in length, fair and flexible, and prevent patents applying to software.

•	Introduce a more satisfactory law on so-called malicious comments made on social media than the blanket and crude section 127 of the Communications Act 2003.

•	Oppose the privatisation of data held by the government that should be open to all, such as the Postcode Address File, or by companies providing public services, such as data on the progress of buses that can be used by Smartphone apps to predict waiting times.

•	Oppose the sale of personal data, such as health or tax records, for commercial or other ends.

•	Use government purchasing power to support open standards in information technology.

1) Real Ulstermen predate Christianity and therefore Catholicism. As soon as that Welsh fucker Paddy raised the ghost of Cú Chulainn to make King Lóegaire convert to Christianity it all went downhill for the real Ulsterman. I'd also say that the Roman Catholic church is and has been one of the most destructive and hateful institutions on the planet and should probably be crushed. Especially for making out as if someone as cool as Cú Chulainn was somehow in hell. Fucking dicks.

When you have a whole crop that shares the same genetic code, there is an increased risk of it being wiped out by a single disease, sure.  But that doesn't have anything to do with GMO's specifically; some of our crops that have the greatest risk there, like bananas for example, weren't genetically modified, they were created using more traditional farming techniques.  

In fact, genetically modifying crops can be at least a partial solution to that problem.

Point 1. The writer immediately comes across as a... Well fan girl hating close minded... Person. His entire opening statement is just him going 'Tennant is only popular because fan girls!'.

Yes, fan girls are a part of Tennant's popularity, but so are people who love watching a good actor act in well written stories. Tennant's continuing career after Doctor Who proves that he wasn't simply a handsome face on a one off lucky break. 

Point 2.

HIS OVERUSE OF CATCHPHRASES? WHAT? I mean... What? The writer claims to be aware of the 11th Doctor which must surely mean that he is aware that Tennant's few repetitions of 'Allon-sy' pale in the face of 'FEZZES' 'X IS COOL' and 'Geronimo!' every other blooming episode. I mean I'm pretty sure Wibbly wobbly was literally only used in Blink (maybe Time Crash as well). 

'Sorry' is not a catch phrase. Nor is 'Trust me, I'm The Doctor' (maybe across the whole series) and the whats were only done once or twice for humour. 

Rose overshadows every other companion? 

Maybe in his view, I personally remember Donna far more than Rose. Rose was a consistent theme throughout his run but you know what? It was nice to see somebody actually experience grief over losing somebody close to them the way that well... Real people do. No other Doctor has ever portrayed that like Tennants, Smith losing Amy was forgotten after a 5 minute explanation scene from Vastra when we were told he was stropping and that short bit before he regenerated. 

The show survived without him

That means he sucks? No. Some higher ups at the BBC were concerned that because Tennant, RTD and most of the shows crew were leaving the show wouldn't be able to continue. Of course, we know better but it wasn't an unreasonable fear considering the reaction to the news that he was leaving. 

Series 3 is great. Smith and Jones is a great intro, Shakespeare Code is a good romp, Gridlock is fantastic, Daleks is admittedly terrible. 42 is fun again, Lazarus suffers from some bad CGI but has a great introspective on The Doctor, Human Nature/Family Of Blood is simply fantastic, Blink is Blink, Utopia, Sound Of Drums... Most of Last Of The Timelords... It's a solid season, it might be the weakest of Tennant's run but it's only that because the other two seasons are so great. 

A man doesn't read a womans signals means that his Doctor is terrible?

Well... Okay then. 

The regeneration. Yes it was drawn out, yes probably too much but in many ways it was the end of a show, it was the end of the RTD era and although the show has the same name aside from the theme tune being similar everything changed in the Eleventh Hour.

Unless you have 2 years service, there is no unfair dismissal available to you. Though you may technically fit the redundancy description, you have no right to a payment because your service is less than 2 years. 

You maybe have a breach of contract claim but we would need to know more to be more specific. How long were you working there? Did you receive a written statement of terms (not a contract per se, but a precursor to one)? These are relevant to your status and therefore whether you are an employee or a worker because being an employee would entitle you to a notice period -even for redundancy under ERA s136(4)(a). 

Unfortunately, it seems like you'll get nothing, or at least, what you might be entitled to, isn't worth chasing ( something like one weeks notice pay). You can't challenge decision-making unless there is discrimination, and a court or tribunal wouldn't reinstate you here.

My favourite way to cook it is to brown it in a pan, then finish it in the oven. 

Heat your oven to about 200^^o C. 

Take a large frying pan - ideally one you can put straight into the oven. Fry the quail on each breast until the skin has browned. 

Then either put the pan straight into the oven, or transfer the quail to a roasting tin. Add a bit of butter for richness, and roast for about 5-10 minutes, depending on the size of the quail.

Once they're cooked through (juices run clear and the meat's not pink), set the quail aside to rest for about five minutes, then serve.


You can do this in a traditional style, and serve it with roast potatoes, honey parsnips, crispy smoked bacon and a bread sauce.

I also *kind* of think it's partly behind the anti-EU stance. The EU is moving away from being something Britain can hold a bit of guilt-trippy Nazi-beating sway over and onto something that has new ideas, new ambitions, new integrations and doesn't give a toss about Britain.

What?

Does she mean, what they watch informs them of what they should do? As in influence? Maybe, it does but I don't see any studies saying that looking at porn when you are young turns you into a predator, in fact it shows the opposite, but then she brings up statistics of violence against women. It became very clear very quickly what her motives here are.

 This journalist makes some good points but she heavily implies that watching porn is a bad thing and that only women are the ones that have things expected of them. Yeah I agree that porn these days is unrealistic and silly, but the solution is not taking it away, its education which she sais is not good enough. So what's the plan then? Suppose we have no choice, ban porn. 

You can't show statistics about something but then don't bring up the other side of the argument, it's a very weak and cheap tactic.

How is the record of ""protection"" for these groups under Islam (or various incarnations of Islam)? The reality is that these groups are only ""protected"" as long as they: do no build houses of worship; do not try to promote their religions; do no carry out public display of worship; and worst of all: pay the *zakat* - protection money to Islamic religious gangsters.

Everywhere Islam exists, religious minorities are horrible persecuted, attacked, oppressed, and discriminated against. Everywhere. From Morocco to Malaysia.

Since I also wrote that ""in terms of sophistication and nuance it's obviously a different universe from feminist CiF columns,"" yes, in a manner, of course. Just cause it's difficult doesn't mean it's not worth it. I didn't get through the bell hooks book I borrowed, but I still learned from it (and who's to say you're not smarter or hardier than me?).

But you're still ignoring the entire meat of my argument. You wrote that you found ""the leaders of the movement"" to be ""becoming more extreme"", and added that you are judging who those leaders are on the basis of ""Guardian columnists"" and the like. My argument is not just that you're looking at the wrong ""leaders"", but that you're asking the wrong question in the first place.

There are no ""leaders of the movement"". There are different manifestations of feminism in different parts of society. They're in academia, yes, and those women write books you can read. In another comment you wrote that ""of course I have read feminist writers"", so, OK; Butler, to stick with her, seems to have been the single most lauded feminist thinker of the last decade or two. What about her work strikes you as ""extreme""? Then they're also in legislative politics. E.g. Sen. Mikulski or Rep. Rosa DeLauro are not writing feminist treatises, they're writing bills. Yet their work represents a part of feminism too - and of course you're free to read (about) those bills. Do you consider those extreme? Feminism is also in street activism. To stick with the US, it's for example the [Women's Freedom March](http://womensfreedommarch.org/). Do the issues and priorities they highlight strike you as extreme? And finally, feminism is also the bloggers and columnists on Tumblr, Salon etc., sure. 

To judge feminism, as a whole - as silly as I think that endeavour by itself is - you have to take on board all those aspects. The Tumblr blogs; the thinkers who write books - and the feminism FAQ's list of recommended works that I linked to has a bunch more of those; but also the politicians who write laws, and, say, the feminist activist who's helping to organize the National Domestic Workers Alliance to improve the labor conditions of the (overwhelmingly) women who work in that sector.

I haven't been in a while, but I'm going to this one. The only games I've been to this season is the League Cup game against Newcastle, home to Southampton and home to West Ham. 3 awful games. The only consolation was seeing Andy Johnson in the Newcastle game.

I think it's fortunate that we're playing teams that need the points while we're safe. It keeps the remaining games interesting. After this game, it's Hull, then Chelsea, United, Liverpool, Swansea. It's only the Swansea game where there's nothing to play for.

I want to be optimistic, but we're up against Pulis. They'll probably put everyone behind the ball, and get a scrappy goal from a corner in the 85th minute. I really hope I'm wrong though. They really need 3 points to push them to safety. I was a big fan of Pulis, and he did an incredible job for this club, but he thought he was better than us.

Is this *really* the best feminism has to offer - the anti-scientific claim that gender is culturally constructed?  

Oh, then I read:

&gt;Butler was criticized for statements she had made about Hamas and Hezbollah. She had described them as “social movements that are progressive, that are on the Left, that are part of a global Left”.[60] She was accused of defending ""Hezbollah and Hamas as progressive organizations"" and supporting their tactics.

I really don't think he has played to expectations this season yet, I remember most were expecting him to score a few goals to make up for the loss of Suarez and to carry us a bit more but that hasn't really happened really. If he's going to be playing behind the striker in a 433/4231 he needs to be scoring every 3/4 games if we want to be a top team. Even Henderson is currently outscoring him and is creating more chances/assists.

He has been pretty amazing at dictating play for the past few months though, but shouldn't that really be up to Henderson&amp;Allen...?

Even Rodgers has said it that he's more of a Modric type player, not really a traditional CAM so why he's constantly played there I'll never know.

If you compare polls from the same company (using the same methodology) we can be pretty confident about the direction voters are moving. If you look at a few different polls from different companies (to try and average out the methodology errors) you can be reasonably certain about the rough percentages but once you get to the seat predictions you can't be confident of the result, especially in a tight race like this election looks set to be.

Edit: you could build a better seat prediction by doing individual constituency poll for every seat but this would be extremely expensive.

Swiss people pay a Federal and a Canton income tax (Like state and national taxes in the USA, Switzerland is a very devolved nation administratively)

Most Swiss citizens are paid gross and submit an annual tax return and pay their taxes. So are foreign workers with residency

If you work as a contractor without residency, you will be taxed at source.. it isnt PAYE, its a withholding tax - your employer makes tax contributions for you by withholding part of your salary and paying it over, most workers then file a return and make corrections as appropriate

Taxes vary between Cantons and you need to know where you will be working and look up the relevant rules

I've worked in Zurich periodically - most professionals speak English as well as German but tax offices seem to be an exception. I've had to learn German as although I, and most Swiss citizens, speak reasonable French, accents and mutual intelligibility were an issue. You may need to learn the local tongue as I expect French and Italianate cantons have similar issues   -  or find a trusted friend to interpret for you at times.

IMPORTANT NOTE  - I'm an accountant not a tax adviser. In this post I repeat my observations of Swiss taxes as they are practised by my employers.

We are not talking about people, we're talking about a political party. What they did was wrong because it just added to the belief that their party was racist, allowing the media to use it as a weapon.

&gt;On the other hand, from what you've said, you would apologise and change everything that attracts controversy. 

No, I just wouldn't do it again if it was more bother than it was worth. Was adding a couple of pictures of black/asian people a problem? If it wasn't, why not just do it to avoid this kind of story?

&gt;I think that is pointless and petty tokenism. 

But this story wouldn't exist. Nor would the Bloom/Crick incident exist. For a political party, would they rather people keep talking about them and race or would they prefer to ditch the perception of them being a racist party?

&gt;But when the colour of the people in a manifesto affects people's opinion on a party, I get a bit annoyed and speak up a bit.

null,false,WArch,null,null,null,"It's possible if they abandon the pension triple lock, I think that they've backed themselves in to a corner there. If wage growth picks up then freezes in working age benefits won't have as much impact. For the past five years we've had a perfect storm of benefit cuts, inflation and low wage growth, if there's low inflation and higher wage growth in the future then benefit freezes or even cuts would lead to slower wage growth but not wage cuts as have been seen in the last few years. However, high wage growth would also mean that pensions have to rise more quickly due to the triple lock. 

From searching around on the internet this is what they've set out:

* Freeze of working age benefits for two years - £2 billion 

* Remove housing benefit from those aged 18 to 21 - £120m

* Reduce the household benefit cap from £26,000 to £23,000 a year - £150m a year

* Raise minimum wage to £8 - don't know 


So less than a quarter of what they set out. For what it's worth, Labour's proposals:

* Restrict the cash increase in child benefit in April 2016 to 1% - £30m

* Remove the winter fuel payment from pensioners paying income tax at the higher or additional rate - £150m

Possible measures neither have supported:

* Extend freeze to the full five years - £6.9 billion

* Extend freeze to disability as well - £10 billion

* Making Housing Benefit recipients pay 10% of the cost - £2.5 billion

* Restrict benefits for families with children to the first two children - £1 billion 

From [this](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-32084722) 
* Carer's Allowance - this could be restricted to those eligible for Universal Credit. Leaked documents suggest about 40% of claimants would lose out. DWP predicted saving - £1bn
 
* The contributory element of Employment and Support Allowance and Job Seekers Allowance - currently claimants who have paid enough National Insurance contributions can get the benefits with little means testing; DWP analysis suggests 30% of claimants, over 300,000 families, would lose about £80 per week. DWP predicted saving - £1.3bn in 2018/19
 
* Disability benefits - Disability Living Allowance, Personal Independence Payments and Attendance Allowance (for over 65s who have personal care needs) would no longer be paid tax free. Possible saving - £1.5bn per annum (based on IFS Green Budget calculation )
 
* Industrial Injuries Compensation Scheme - could be replaced by companies providing industrial injury insurance policy for employees. Any that did not would become members of a default national industrial injuries scheme, similar to the programme for asbestos sufferers. DWP predicted saving - £1bn

* Council Tax Support - to be incorporated into Universal Credit. Possible saving - not known

* Child Benefit - Limiting the benefit to the first two children. Possible saving IFS estimates £1bn saving per annum in the long run but little initially

* Regional Benefit Caps - The £23,000 limit would vary in different parts of the country, with for instance Londoners receiving the top amount due to the higher cost of living.

null,false,TomShoe,1972crest,,null,"How much of Pellegrini's career did you follow before City? He has a reputation for doing a lot with very little. The year before he took over City, he took his Malaga side to the CL quarter finals *while they weren't being paid*, due to the owners financial troubles. He ultimately lost to Klopp's Dortmund, interestingly enough, in probably the best CL game I've ever seen — I feel it's also worth mentioning that that Malaga side was a much weaker team than that years dortmund. Before that, he was the last manager to break Madrid and Barca's dominance over La Liga with a second place finish with Villareal. That record stood for 11 years, until last years Atleti won the league.

With more resources, he was able to win the league in his first season at both Real — even though he was given little control over transfers, and little confidence from the management — and City. It's also worth remembering that the City team he took over, though immensely talented, was very troubled in the locker room, as it is now, and he was able to calm some searing tempers.

Pellegrini is one of the best coaches in the world IMO, about on par with Klopp. If there is a difference, it's not big enough to get rid of Pellers just to sign Klopp. If the board do decide to let Pellegrini go, I think Klopp is a great alternative, but I don't think it's worth dropping him solely because Klopp's available IMO.

What? If Mikel is fit to play in the position that he actually plays, then he should start, not Zouma. He would be far better for that position that Zouma. 

Why do people here want Zouma playing there when our midfield is fit to play? Even in the tottenham game he was getting dragged around in the first half and looked lost at times. It was his sheer talent and athleticism that made him impressive eventually in the second half. Not to mention it was just Tottenham. The only reason he played there was because it was an emergency measure. We were handicapped..

We shouldn't be playing players out of position. If we want more physicality in the midfield, then Mikel is the man for the job. Just like what we did away against stoke.

null,false,Cursed_Sun,cnty-wales,Surrounded by sheep,null,"Okay, well what would change if we left the EU?


With regards to immigration:

We would lose the most beneficial group of immigrants, as well as some of those that UKIP doesn't want. Even if there was a points based system in place, so only 'desirable' people moved here, how many of these would want to come to a country governed by a xenophobic party who broke a longstanding international treaty? Net immigration would decrease, sure, but it wouldn't be a beneficial in an economic sense. If you wanted to further get rid of 'undesirable' people, like refugee's who technically should still be in Italy, Greece or wherever in the EU they first arrived, you'll have to tighten up border controls massively, which is inefficient and frequently ineffective. These people are so desperate for a better life, and obviously being poor and not having access to the same  amount of information that we do, don't understand European laws on asylum seekers, that measures to stop them would be counterproductive to trade (slowing down and complicating entry to Britain puts off people considering where to sell, as well as obviously reducing the amount of stuff entering the country). Which leads nicely to the next, fairly important point...

Trade:

 Who the hell would we trade with? An average of just under £20 billion worth of imports come from the EU, and about £13 billion of exports from Britain each month since September 2013. That's a lot. Leaving the EU, and judging from UKIP's rational, potentially groups such as the OSCE and the EEC, would hugely impact our economy. Sure, you can show that we'd stop paying into organisations such as these and save money, but compared to the benefits we'd lose, these savings would be nothing. This is just considering the immediate impact, the long term effects on trade could easily ruin our country - never mind the impact on the rest of Europe.



Education:

There are hundreds of thousands of people from the EU studying in the UK. Without them, we would have a shortage of students unless entry requirements, and costs dropped. This would lead to extra funding being required for universities, either from the government, private funds, or other students. Leaving the EU and linked institutions would make it harder to study in the UK as someone from the EU by far. These immigrants are a huge boon to our country, and losing them would have an effect - though not as large as some of the others - on our country as a whole: We'd have less professionals, as well as less funding for the universities. This also goes the other way. Say you're a student, and want to go to one of the many amazing universities in Europe; your choice would be more limited unless you were rich enough to pay extra. This would cause an increase in competition for places in universities here for certain, and probably lead to more people studying in institutions that aren't as good as the ones they could have been.



Possibly less important to you, but the European social fund and other Structural funds:

Lots of the developments to the poorest parts of the country have come from Europe. Without it, there are huge investments in my part of the world that would never have been made, and local economies and outlooks would be even further down the drain.



International politics:

How do you think the rest of the world would react to us leaving the EU? It sure as hell wouldn't look good to them... A rich, powerful country, leaving an international institution which has had huge benefits for it's members... How could we be trusted then?



Long term impact:

More independence as a country (no meddling European laws favouring British dairies, improving trade links, allowing population movement between countries), absolute hammer blow our economy, increased cost for students, worry for businesses and fiscal institutions (no one's quite sure what effect leaving the EU would have on exchange rates, interest rates and the like) leading to a decreased likelihood of investment or any economic risk taking. If we left the EU, and carried on making the UK independent, we would find ourselves more and more well...independent, and there's no way that any country could exist as ours does today without integration with the world around it. 

Even if you disagree with all of this (which is fair enough, I haven't supplied the sources - though they are mostly UK government, with some EU and UN ones, as well as one or two independent studies), and think that the EU is completely broken and of no benefit to us, how on earth could you improve the EU whilst not being a part of it? Assuming you don't want to cut all ties with Europe, the only options are between reforming and maintaining the status quo, one of which UKIP is arguing against, and the other would be impossible if we did leave the EU.",null,0,null,1429228077,null,0,false,0,cqex0ze,null,t3_32ug17,null,t1_cqex0ze,null,t1_cqeurw2,null,null,null,1432435067,null,30,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,30,null

You will not be sectioned based on this, you will never be sectioned unless you are a serious risk to yourself or others. It's an incredibly serious process that no doctor would make move towards without good reasoning, especially since they need a second doctor to agree with them and - this is the most important here - they'd need to ask you to go to hospital for treatment and for you to refuse on top of that.

If you feel like you need to see a doctor for possible depression, please see a doctor. There is no risk to you from them. They are not going to try to screw you over.

null,false,sesamee,null,null,null,"NICOLA Sturgeon has appeared to back down on proposals for full fiscal autonomy for Scotland after days of criticism over a £7.6 billion black hole it would create in Scottish finances.

First Minister said she wants to keep the Barnett formula which provides 20 per cent more funding for Scots than England and Wales in reaction to a Ukip manifesto pledge to scrap it, while pushing back the proposed introduction of full fiscal autonomy.

She said: “So for as long as Scotland’s funding is still determined by Westminster then the Barnett formula should stay in place. Obviously if Scotland was to become in years ahead fiscally autonomous then we are in a different position but the Barnett formula should stay until that time.”

She also said new tax powers could “take years” but opponents pointed out that the SNP claimed independence could be achieved in 18 months,

A spokesman for Ukip described the Barnett Formula as “the Scottish cringe” but pointed out that like the SNP the party “wants Scotland to be self-funding.”

Labour’s shadow Scottish Secretary Margaret Curran said: “Another day, another financial policy from the SNP. They want rid of the Barnett formula but really they recognise how important it is for Scotland so claim they could keep it until they introduce their damaging full fiscal fantasy.”

Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said: “Nicola Sturgeon wants all the benefits of controlling all taxes but none of the risks that go with that responsibility.”

An SNP spokesman said: “We know that transferring devolved powers to Scotland within the UK takes a period of years - the Calman Commission reported in 2009 with the support of the three Westminster parties, the subsequent Scotland Act didn’t pass until 2012, and its provisions will only finally be delivered in 2016, with transitional arrangements in place until 2018 or 2019.

I think riding 2 (or more) abreast should be illegal (and enforced!) unless an overtake is being made, and there should be only certain circumstances where this can happen (straight, visible roads for example). Also bunched up, many party groups should be very much discouraged as they are a nightmare to get past on winding, low speed roads. 

Visibility is a huge issue so lights should be mandatory (helmet/body light front and back) and maybe high viz clothing or strips being made a mandatory part of bike clothing manufacture moving forward. 

I think the complete lack of accountability should be addressed with some sort of unique identifier for either the bike or rider as another poster mentioned. Practically, stickers and plates cost very little to get printed up. I have no idea about existing computer systems or infrastructure capabilities though.

Dedicated push bike insurance (as opposed to a tack on for house insurance) should be mandatory for push bikers (the infrastructure is already in place for this one) as it at the least splits the potential liability for a pay out in the event of an accident and everyone knows tricked out push bikes can cost ££££! It's also to reflect the fact that not every accident involving a push bike is exclusively the fault of the other party and so naturally that other party's insurance shouldn't have to take the brunt of the ££££!

Maybe Levy shouldn't have allowed the Bale money to be spent in the way it was - but can you blame a commercially minded chairman for 1. realising that the past few transfer windows hadn't been successful, and 2. bringing in a Director of football, changing strategy and completely trusting their judgement. To me that is the sign of a very astute chairman. It turned out to be a bad decision, so like every other time he has screwed up, he recognised his error and changed his ways.

Say what you want about Levy, he has sacked a lot of managers, spent money without return, changed things up regularly, but everytime he does, it's because he's pro actively trying to achieve success.

They have not provided a contract, validation (the actual accounting) or are willing to swear an affidavit stating the alleged debt.

Record every encounter with bailiffs as they have tried force in the past.
And remember if you feel distressed by their actions then they are operating unlawfully and you should tell them to leave your property ie front door.
 NEVER, EVER LET THEM IN OR GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO ENTER. 
If they fail to leave call the police and explain you fell distressed and require immediate assistance. 
The attending officer/s took an oath to uphold common law (England is a common law jurisdiction,  no harm, injury or loss to others, not be fraudulent in your dealings and keep the peace just about covers the Law)

Living here in Portsmouth I feel that we are at the heart of this debate, with a large military influence, house shortage, issues with QA hospital waiting times as well as being the only city in the UK that has a population density larger than London.

I have watched both of the TV debates, as well as reading up on the manifestos (I haven't finished yet) and observed the following:

The issues that everyone is trying to answer are the ones that I mentioned previously that affect our city. A lack of (affordable) housing in the UK, fear surrounding Defence, people worried about Healthcare in addition to tackling our deficit and our debt.

Everyone apart from UKIP appears to be pandering to the person asking the question. They want to increase spending on housing, defence and the NHS which is excellent, just what people want to hear. What isn't so great is they aren't being clear about where the money is coming from which frankly stops me from trusting them.

UKIP is the only party to have an independently verified cost assessment of their manifesto (although Lib Dems may have done something similar, but quite I believe). 

If we can put to one side for the moment whether limiting immigration is right or wrong for the moment I would like to say this:

UKIP plan to leave the EU and restrict immigration whilst still allowing foreign students and foreign tourists to separately visit the UK - on the condition they have insurance.

Reducing the amount of people coming into the county means that more of the houses built here can go towards those that already live here - that just makes mathematical sense. The separate question to that is, will the reduced number of immigrants working in the UK prevent those houses from being built.

Less people in the UK also means that there is less of a strain on GPs and the NHS meaning that any additional funds will go further.

My final point on that would be that controlling immigration was controlled, and required skilled workers were the only ones allowed to come here on work visas, that would mean they would be earning a higher wage than their unskilled counter parts meaning the average contribution to the UK per migrant worker would be even higher. You cannot knock a worker in the EU working in poor conditions with poor pay wanting to come to the UK, its precisely why people come down South from the North already.

Now, it UKIP were fortunate enough to be in power, and the public reject leaving the EU. I am still behind their policies in Education to promote apprenticeships and making degrees in science and engineering free. I am still for getting rid of inheritance tax which appear to only affect the working class as the rich can avoid it with careful planning. There are other policies I also agree with and disagree with, but I shall leave it there.

I see UKIP as being the only ones with a serious plan, a verified plan, to reducing the UK's spending and reducing our debt. The thing I like about Farage is he sticks to his guns when it comes to his policies, he isn't looking to make friends and the more stick he gets, the more I feel I can support him to be our PM.

*************************************
Disclaimer: What I am trying to say is that his policy, for better or for worse, makes financial sense, even if you disagree with leaving the EU. I am yet to finish reading everyones manifestos, so until them my mind hasn't been made up, but what I am looking for is a plan that can ultimately solve our immediate problems whilst reducing our spending and debts long term.

If a group of 5 students came up from London to my constituency, the chances are they'd be Tory-leaning. If for arguments sake, the seat was Extremely close and the Conservatives won by 4 seats (the students votes), but the students themselves returned home at the end of the semester, then that leaves the remaining electorate governed by the now minority government. The remaining electorate should, in a fair system, be represented by the second largest party. But they wouldn't. The students would have secured an outcome unwanted by the people most affected by the result, without having to experience the effect of the decision themselves.

&gt; Meanwhile, my vote is more likely to swing the actual result at uni

I won't lie: considering manipulation of the place you vote, to have maximum impact, seems very immoral to me. You're in a position most people aren't in because you essentially have dual residence and your vote should not be able to have greater effect just because you can chose where to cast it.

The issue (as far as UKIP goes) is whether curbing immigration would mitigate these problems. I think not.

&gt; Reducing the amount of people coming into the county means that more of the houses built here can go towards those that already live here

Not really. What about all of the ex-pats living in france, spain etc. If we quit the EU, a lot of those people will be forced to up sticks and come home. It's not the one way street that you assume. We have millions of people retired abroad. Equally important to a lot of UKIP's core voting demographic - what happens to house prices if we assume that the shortage is over? Supply and demand dictates that the price will fall, and we are back in the 80's with millions of home-owners in negative equity. Nice. Building firms going bust? You can bet on it.

&gt; Less people in the UK also means that there is less of a strain on GPs and the NHS meaning that any additional funds will go further.

Have you looked into the [figures](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jan/26/nhs-foreign-nationals-immigration-health-service) to support this? 26% of doctors are foreign. 11% of all NHS staff. This does not include Doctors or Dentists who are not NHS employees. SO let's say the qualified ones are allowed to stay. The figures also do not include cleaning staff, catering staff and other ancillery roles carried out by companies contracting work from the NHS. Who will clean the hosptial when the foreign workers leave? How will you persuade the average british unemployed worker to get out of bed to clean hosptial floors for a minimum wage? I mean, the opportunity is there for him. He only has to apply. In the meantime, people from all over the world are beating a path to the country to fill those jobs. British workers should be more desirable than foreign ones to employers, so why do you suppose there are so many jobs for foreign workers?

&gt; The thing I like about Farage is he sticks to his guns when it comes to his policies, he isn't looking to make friends and the more stick he gets, the more I feel I can support him to be our PM.

His plan is to appeal to the idle who prefer to blame outsiders for our problems than accept that our own work ethic is the problem. Until that is fixed, blocking the flow of workers willing to take low paid jobs will only serve to cripple the industries which rely on them. That includes manufacturing, food service and your beloved NHS.

Think it through. You know that hand car wash near you? Probably ran by Polish workers. That is enterprise from people prepared to get up and get their hands dirty. Where are the British car washes? Anyone can do that. You don't need expensive equipment, or skills or anything more than a bucket, a cloth and some work ethic. So where are the British people setting up in competition?

Levy has taken us from that, gotten us into a much more stable financial position, has progressively tried to acquire people and managers that will help the brand of football played on the pitch, and gotten us into the Champions League once, and arguably should've a couple of times more.  That's all happened in a relatively short amount of time.

I think he's made a number of mistakes, the biggest being too fiscally conservative when it's come to investing in players.  I said it in another thread recently, but spending the Bale money and *just* the Bale money was never going to work.  We weren't trying to maintain the status quo... we were trying to both sell our best player AND finish higher in the league the following season.

And you know this how?

Do you have a personal line to Guardiola?

Quite frankly, it's pretty stupid to talk in such absolutes when you're merely speculating.

I've found the quotes which are the origin of this train of thought. They come from a Spanish journalist who wrote a book chronicling Guardiola's first season at Bayern. The quotes come from exerts of the book with the author describing Guardiola's search for a new club after Barcelona:

&gt;From the start, Pep was well disposed to the overtures from the Bavarian club. A year before, in late July 2011, not long after a resounding 3-1 victory in the Champions League final against Manchester United at Wembley, Barcelona competed in the Audi Cup in Munich.

&gt;Pep liked the set-up at Säbener Strasse [Bayern's training complex], despite the fact that it was smaller than Barça's training ground and had fewer technical facilities.

&gt;The Catalan was impressed and told Manel Estiarte [his personal assistant] privately: ""I like this place. I could see myself coaching here one day. Pep had said something very similar a few months before, at Manchester United.

&gt;The day after beating Real Madrid in the Champions League semi-final, Guardiola and Estiarte travelled to Manchester to watch their next opponent in action.

&gt;It was May 4, 2011, and the pair sat together in the stands of Old Trafford watching Sir Alex Ferguson's team beat Schalke 4-1. Once again Pep had turned to his friend and said: ‘I like this atmosphere. I could see myself coaching here one day.'

&gt;Guardiola has always felt a deep admiration, almost veneration, for the legendary teams and players of Europe.

Paints a very different picture from the one you've presented.

Ancelotti is a brilliant coach and man manager, but tactically, he's really not all that special. His teams are very well drilled, brimming with talent, and have excellent morale, but they don't tend to play that special of a game. I'm sure he could bring us success, he seems to do that everywhere he goes, but in a league with such tactically astute managers as Mourinho and van Gaal, I feel that could be his undoing.

Diego I have an immense respect for, I think he's easily as good as Ancelotti, and perhaps Pep, but I really dislike his philosophy. It's not fun to watch, and it attracts lots of criticism, meaning the board probably won't go for it either. Great manager, but not the one we need.

Klopp is a good manager for sure, but not all that much better than Pellegrini if I'm honest. Very positive style, but in a very different way then Pep. Casual supporters seem to find it more entertaining to watch, although he often lacks a plan b, something Pellers is often criticised for. He also has a pretty poor record in the transfer market. He outspent Bayern by a net spend of 55m, and by a total expenditure of 13m last year, and hasn't really got anything to show for it. I'm willing to assume Dormund's poor performance this year is an anomaly, but I'm still not convinced he represents a significant enough improvement.

Viera will likely manage us one day, but he's not ready yet, end of. He's been managing the youth team for two years and has no management experience prior to that. Granted, Pep was in the same boat before he took over Barca, so anything's possible, but it's a huge risk at this point. My bet is he'll be an assistant manager for whoever does take over.

That leaves Pep. Not much left to say about him that hasn't already been said. He's probably the best football coach active right now. Some people don't like him because he didn't shake someone's hand once or something.",null,0,null,1429247274,null,0,1429248846,0,cqf6sr7,null,t3_32up4j,null,t1_cqf6sr7,null,t3_32up4j,null,null,null,1432439813,null,2,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,2,null

You know journalists often sensationalise stories and present them with their own personal slant, right?

The title of that article is pure hyperbole, gutter journalism. And you've taken the journalist's editorial headline as a quote from Guardiola himself, and presented it as such on here.

As I said, the whole story comes from the exerts from the book, read them minus the journalist's slant on them, and come to your own conclusions.

The meeting with Ferguson shows just how many clubs were after his services in 2012/13 during his year out. If you wanted to, and you were a gutter press hack serving a personal agenda or aiming for click bait, you could just as easily put a spin on that story as Guardiola snubbed United.

Ignore the fluff mate. Always go for the meat and bone of an article: the quotes. It's an acquired skill.

All journalists present stories slightly differently, some sensationalise them more than others. It's important to distinguish between what is editorial, and a journalist's opinion, and the actual facts presented within.

Lloris is up there is saves, 94, but low on clean sheets - 6.

De Gea is up there on clean sheets (10), but low on saves 84.

I think De Gea has been good but even though United defense hasn't been great I would say it has been better than both Swans and Spurs.

I think we would serve ourselves much better if we treated illegal immigrants with dignity- after all it's a rational choice to want to move somewhere safer, and if we radically changed what foreign policy and are our armed forces do. Imagine if a fraction of the resources that army gets to build a military city in the middle of the desert was spent on building a city for people to live in. The sooner we stop killing people, and treat people we don't know very well with dignity and respect these 'immigration problems' will fade.

Immigration aside, it's our largely unaccountable foreign policy that is fucking things up for us.

Years ago I had a g/f who was at Cambridge and spent 2 years more or less living in N.Wales and still got a first in Chemistry. You are committed but if you work hard when you are there - you don't have to be there all the time.

Secondly, If you want to do something else now - do it now.  I was 26 before I got my degree because I wanted to go climbing and piss around in the mountains.

Thirdly don't worry if your not sure of what you want to do with your self at 19.  I have had quite a few careers now (each one lasts about 10 years).  Don't get caught up in the idea that *Whatever you do now commits you for the rest of your life and if you don't sick it out till you die you have failed* - cos that's rubbish.

William S Burroughs once said something along the lines of ""Its unrealistic to expect someone at the age of 18 to know what they want to do with the rest of their lives.  Most people don't know until they are 28.  The most interesting people I know still have no idea at 48"".

We are most likely have a strong nationalist voting block in the from of the SNP at Westminster after the general election. Due to the non-symmetry of devolution; this voting block (who only really cares about Scotland) can vote through bills which only benefit Scotland.

England does not have a devolved parliament. England answers directly to Westminster. This means that England (and in a lesser way Wales and Northern Ireland) can not shield it's self against bills that pass, unlike Scotland who can.

A example of this is the SNP vote for a (massive) increase in the English NHS budget, hence by default the Scottish NHS budget. To help raise taxes to fund this increase they (SNP) vote for a ""Mansion"" tax. Such a tax would most likely affect people in England more than it would in Scotland. If tax is slightly devolved at this time, the Mansion tax could even be blocked by Hollyrood. Meaning that England is now paying for an increased Scottish NHS budget.

Until England gets at least it's own devolved parliament there will always be the concern of the ""The Scottish tail wagging the English dog"" in England. Depending on what the SNP does during the next parliamentary term we may, or may not, see the rise of anti-Scottish sentiment in England.

As well as this it tosses to the side the benefits recreational regulation could have along side medical access.

George Osborne was sharing a panel with Ms Lagarde and the German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, when she made the remarks.
&gt;""Generally in any election year, the teams that provide the hypotheticals on which future deficits are forecast, err on the side of caution and assume that whatever is announced is not necessarily or inevitably going to happen,"" she said.

""It's clearly also delivering results because when we look at the comparative growth rates delivered by various countries in Europe, it's obvious that what's happening in the UK has actually worked,"" she said.

He has done this. We have also written to his MP. There is a stonewall as it is a legal / police matter. However the damage being done is in the time that the process has managed to keep him away from his wife, who he wants nothing more than to care for.

&gt; The therapist is very unlikely to be part of any conspiracy as these allegations do nothing but cause a headache for them, there is no benefit at all to them.

I agree. However there is also no benefit to my friend in going daily to care for his wife, only to use the time to abuse her, particularly while she is under constant medical monitoring and supervision. He was the one that took her to the care home (and could instead have kept her at home if his intent was to abuse her). He was also the one who identified the original 'burn' blister on her arm. Another very similar blister has appeared on her during the time that he has been prevented from seeing his wife. 

The therapist may not be consciously conspiring against them, but she has through staggered accusations managed to keep him away for two months so far, and the indication is it will be two more months before he can be interviewed over the new allegation. There is absolutely no evidence from, or oversight of this therapist and her assessments of the communicative ability of Tony's wife.

&gt;Just to be clear in Sri Lanka he could beat his wife half to death and the authorities wouldnt step in, the ""justice"" system there is entirely male bias.

He is not in Sri Lanka. He is in the UK. The authorities are stepping in in this case without presenting evidence, and staggering the charges to extend the time. It appears to be the lone action of the therapist that is triggering it, and there is no oversight or independent assessment of her work. If she did have her own suspicions, or fears for the safety of Tony's wife, fine, but it seems she is the only one able to make those calls because she is the interpreter of Tony's vegetative wife, who spoke almost no English even when she was able bodied.",null,0,null,1429258388,null,0,false,0,cqfa2g1,null,t3_32v8as,null,t1_cqfa2g1,null,t1_cqf9twb,null,null,null,1432441353,null,2,false,LegalAdviceUK,t5_32g6u,2,null

**2.** I have the top floor of the office to myself, so I'm listening to 6Music and some old post rock stuff I've recently gotten into again.

**3.** Got a bit of work to finish tomorrow morning in London then I'm off to do a big shop before the gym and, finally, a metric shit-tonne of beer in Barnet with my housemates and pals.

**4.** Still finishing off The Bees, but I could have that rattled through by this evening. I'm moving on to Sharpe's Tiger after that.

I absolutely think Cameron and Clegg should have been there standing up for their policies. But that's the thing - I'll be voting based on policies and who I think will run the country best. Also, on which local candidate I think which best represent me, regardless of what rosette they wear. Our previous MP just followed the whip exactly and didn't stand up for us at all. Enquiries were brushed off with ""I completely agree with the government's view on this matter"". So we binned her and our current MP actually represents his constituents, replies to letters, etc. If I lived in Vauxhall, I'd be voting for Labour candidate Kate Hoey, because she's not afraid to rebel against the party even on a 3-line whip if she thinks it's the right thing to do.

That means the cheap shots along the lines of ""look who didn't show up"" will pay *no part* in my decision making process. They simply distracted from the debate over - you know - policies and stuff.

As will voters, because I don't think (well, I hope) people are so stupid as to be impressed by such empty shots. Every time one of the leaders made a jibe about Cameron not being about there, they were wasting 5 seconds of air time to make a useful point about *why they'd do a better job*.

  I'd complained because I use one of those scan and shop things. The thing that look like Star Trek phasers. Usually, I pew pew the food, it goes in the bag, I blinkyblop at the end of the shop, stick my card in and I'm off skipping towards the car thinking *gosh how futuristic and how easy my life has become*.  
 
#No Longer.  
 
  Let's rewind a few weeks. It's a weekday, England were set to have a dreary performance against either Italy or Lithuania or some other arsehole of a bore-fest friendly that I just couldn't have given a fuck about (proper internationals yeah, but friendlies? Friendlies can fuck off) and I thought *ha yes everyone's going to be in front of the TV it'll be dead off to do a massive shop I go* so I did. And I was right, it was deserted, if possible, the air conditioning would have been blowing tumbleweed down the aisles under the glare of the strip lighting, lizards scampering over carelessly abandoned piles of rock, that sort of thing. But, not. Because it's Tesco on Brighton Road. So, it was just quite empty, bereft of even the yoofs asking me to buy them fags and booze and wotsits or whatever. 
 
 So anyway, back to the thing. First off, scanned my loyalty card (I'm not really loyal, it's just a marriage of convenience) and collected my phaser after I'd collected my trolley with my keyring mounted, ready-for-action trolley token and collected 200 B&amp;H Silver for the missus from the Death&amp;Gambling desk and deposited them in my disappointingly right-veering trolley and shot the shit out of my grocery shop. Celery? *Pew!* Passatta? *Pew pew pew!* What's this? Discounted cider because the box is fucked and held together with duct-tape? ***MEGA PEW!*** Also some socks and other things. It ended up totaling about 150 quid. I got carried away, I know.  
 
  So, having gotten at least one of virtually everything they sell, I make my way to the Pen of Privilege. This is where I sail my laden trolley away from the common folk who's items are touched and scanned by a human, and instead interact with a screen and return my food-*pew*er, throw my card into the machine and skip off.  
 
  But no. Today I was selected for a random service check. The willowy pale beauty that descended from ceiling panels explained that she'd only be a moment and started rummaging through my shopping. *Not a problem* I pointed out, and stood back to let her take charge of my things. It doesn't add much to the story, but she was quite pretty and had a cracking bum. She scanned the first thing, the box of cider. But she didn't scan the yellow reduced label, she scanned the normal barcode which set of imaginary klaxons wailing, red lights and riot squad bursting in from the staff room. I immediately informed her of her mistake, she blushed a bit telling me she'd now have to check the lot as that's what the system required. *Probably should have told you that from the out, as much my mistake as yours, really not a problem.* So, she goes and does the lot without a problem and then tells me it's done and I can pay. But... my shopping in now 235 quid. I ask her what that's about and she's genuinely excited, perhaps thinking that she had after all caught a very clever thief. Or maybe it was just the most interesting thing that had happened since lunch idk.  
 
  As it turns out, she'd just scanned the 200 fags as well. Double fail, and undoubtedly a giant red blot on my otherwise exemplary scan&amp;shop record. She rectified it after having taken a moment to blush a bit more.  
 
  So, now we fast forward to present day. I've since attempted to use the *pew*er a few more times (4) and each time I get a full shop check. Meaning someone has to unpack everything I've previously packed and meticulously, anally placed into their correct bags to correspond to my kitchen cupboards and rummage through everything on a special shelf made for bandits and thieves to stand in front of in shame and embarrassment and costs me time and frowns.  
 
  So, I outlined the problem to Tesco, and gave them a thorough run-down of my *dissatisfaction* in relation to my embarrassment and wasted time to which I was given a scripted 'this is random and shouldn't happen don't worry about it response'. No. No Colin, it's not random if it happens 100% of the time. I just want you people to make it stop.  
 
  So, I shall ramp up my complaint. I also want some vouchers or something. I'm not sure I'll get them but I'll make sure to use lots of adverbs and adjectives to outline my fury in the next email so they'll have to resort to giving me something and bending to my wishes.   
  
 I'm also just going to get a new clubcard in the meantime, probably under a completely stupid name. Maybe my old facebook name of Buxton Wilberforce VonFlabberghast. No point searching that by the way, that account died about 6 months ago.

You see drivers being homicidal in trying to overtake cyclists at times, because they're too impatient to wait until they've turned the next corner.  
I agree that groups of them can be annoying, but unfortunately ""they annoy me!"" is one of those things that comes down to opinion - we can probably be safe in saying we annoy them too. Whose rights trump whose?

Visibility.  
Massive issue for us too. Force it on them, you force it on us. Lights already are a legal requirement of bikes [when ridden at night]. There's no need to mandate it otherwise.  
Also, forcing the legality of visibility on to them, rather than instructing people to *look* is just victim blaming. C'mon; we, of all people, should know better! All you end up with is ""It was their fault I hit them because they didn't have hi-vis on""

Accountability.  
Definitely needed. But how? The nature of bikes means they're easily shareable [I wouldn't want that to change], but how can you enforce an identifier on the cyclist? Anything that costs money for the cyclist means that it will potentially prevent people from getting a bike [similar to the insurance issues]. Even having it as part of a cycling helmet means it costs money, since helmets are not mandatory.

Ultimately, you can't 'punish' the vast majority of cyclists who do things correctly, because of the low number of asshats who don't care.",null,0,null,1429259701,null,0,false,0,cqfadf2,null,t3_32s91b,null,t1_cqfadf2,null,t1_cqey774,null,null,null,1432441497,null,1,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,1,null

Bless you?

&gt; 1. I never know what time I finish on a Friday, but hopefully not late as I've got some bits to do tomorrow now...

9am... GO GO GO!

&gt; 2. I have the top floor of the office to myself, so I'm listening to 6Music and some old post rock stuff I've recently gotten into again.

Oh god I wish I had that, I have headphones and some grumpy folk to look at!

&gt; 3. Got a bit of work to finish tomorrow morning in London then I'm off to do a big shop before the gym and, finally, a metric shit-tonne of beer in Barnet with my housemates and pals.

Whey, party weekend :D

He complained about playing time, and Pellegrini gave him playing time. 40 appearances and 25 starts - which puts him in line with players like Fernandinho and Nasri. Even *Zabaleta* who has been pretty much ever-present in the team has only started 4 games more than him.

He started the Bayern game, the must-win Roma game, both legs vs. Barcelona, both derbies, both Chelsea games, both Arsenal games.

The playing time thing is either a lie, or a fantasy, because he sure as hell isn't going to be getting that much playing time, or start all the important games playing for Arsenal.

So then we here that he wants a long contract on a big salary and people criticise the club for not giving it to him.

I wouldn't mind him staying as a squad player, but he's not good enough to start in a Premier League winning team, or one that goes deep into the CL. Not to mention his biggest asset, the thing that sets him apart, is his effort - which only stands out because he's playing in a team with a bunch of players who haven't always given 100% this season. And his fitness is going to run out as he hits his 30's.

When everyone was fit and playing well last year, no one cared about Milner on the bench because Nasri and Silva were creating 4+ goals a game together.

It's not hard to see the logical steps towards a belief system of wanting the death of all men;  I know many people, many *friends*, who say exactly the same thing, and I don't even know if they're joking or not (and, similarly, I would protest if those friends got into a prominent political position, because they aren't the sort of people I would want influencing the running of a country, or even pretending that they know the first thing that it takes in order to do so).

You say that it's a ""ridiculous"" belief, but we have exactly the same belief used in other forms of social stratification - black supremacists nay want to ""Kill all whites"", white supremacists may want to ""kill all blacks"" etc. We have genocide quite widely. In the likes of China, we can already see the gendercide of women, and there will likely be other examples of gendercide one way or another.

Above all, though, it's petty and immature at best. Replace ""men"" with literally any other descriptive term for humanity, and you enrage *everyone of that in-group*. That's essentially *exactly* how the mechanism of saying something derogatory about a group works.

Key Point: If someone said ""Kill all disabled people"", ""Kill all old people"" or ""Kill all fat people"", no matter how much justification they give or how many times they say ""Lol, jks"", they're still in trouble.

Its great to hear that you feel passionate enough to vote! If everyone had the same level of thought towards politics we could really push for change. 

Here is why I disagree with you about UKIP. Immigration has always been a continuous process for the past century as we look to other countries to help fill our employment needs. The reason immigration is an issue, and one you are told to be concerned about, is due to the massive scapegoating of the richest in society. 

If there were jobs to go around and we werent in hideous debt we wouldnt be having these petty arguments about who is allowed in our country. The financial crisis crippled our economy and bank bailouts have left us in this austerity mess. It is a natural cycle for growth/recession but the reason this one is different is because it was not caused by the natural cycles of the economy but directly attributable to the rich financial sector's greed getting the better of them. 

But immigration is still the problem you may say? The real problem is the 'trickle down effect'. This is the entire economic system we are built on. And its not working. The levels of inequality in our country have increased hugely in the last couple of decades, to levels we have never before seen in human history. This is not the fault of immigrants. This is the fault of the money not trickling down to us normal folk, wealth is created from wealth and no actually tangible goods are being produced. Immigrants will always be needed to fill holes in our jobs markets, we cannot as a society survive without low paid workers who are prepared to do the jobs that we dont want to. One quarter of all NHS workers were born in a foreign country. You cant blame someone for trying to make the best out of their life, and the reason they might get the job ahead of a 'British' person is that they are willing to work harder, for less. This is another founding principle of our economy, the cheapest most productive option will always win. UKIP's policys are all about cheapest and most productive.. apart from when it comes to jobs. If they were to have their way and close our borders we wouldnt function as a country, wouldnt be able to compete globally for jobs and many employers would leave, leading to *more* unemployment. 

You say his plan makes financial sense, but it really doesnt. He wants to increase defense spending, making our world even less safe (our country maybe but not our world). It is one thing to be patriotic to our country but another to still imagine us as a world power. The only part of our country still competing globally is The City in London while Westminster allows the rest of the UK to slowly decline and stagnate.

What Im saying is immigration is not to blame for all the problems you see. In fact, the policys against of immgrants is a **symptom** of much much deeper underlying problems with how our country is run and has been run. This talk of stopping immigration will hurt our relationship with the rest of the world immeasurably. The Australian system leaves thousands imprisoned on remote islands seeking refuge and ending up starving and seperated from their families. Its horribly cruel. The simple truth is that people want to live where they can have a nice life, one day that place might be somewhere else on the planet and we will want to go live there! If we close the gates then we are never going to see a world rid of poverty. Just think about the implications of the political movement! Closing the gates wont make the problem go away, the underlying problems I mean.

I am not going to tell you who to vote for, but please examine the wider knock on consequences of the policys UKIP are implying. Think about why they are a problem and who really has the power to change them. Nigel Farage is such as posh and rich as the rest of them. He is a great speaker, but so was Hitler. Of course he is not as extreme, but the road you are heading down is a dark terrible one. I urge you to reconsider and think about what the real problems with our country are, like tax loopholes for corporations, the environmental impact of our lavishes, and financial gambling in the City.

Mikel isn't needed, he has had 9 years to make the DM role his, and 20 minutes into Matic debut vs stoke I was already seeing what Mikel was lacking from his game.

A tackle 20 yards inside the Stoke half, won the ball, took two strides forward and released the ball out wide.  He didn't panic, he didn't do the silly pirouette thing Mikel does when he just slows down play and just invites the tackle in, Matic simply lifted his head and played a ball  out wide ( and forward) to a team mate, and then sat in the position, the confidence to make a stand and back himself against the stoke midfield.

Why of relevance? Because Mikel would have been 20 yards behind play and never given himself a chance to make the tackle.

I am not basing my judgement on Mikel on not being able to offer anything going forward, but on the fact he doesn't dictate the game like a quality DM should.

The sheer number of times mikel makes the tackle or gets possession and then proceeds to play the ball directly back where it came from, or put another team mate under pressure is shocking.

He has rare glimpses of quality I admit, of course at this level every player is going to have ability.

But I have never seen a game from mikel and thought, he bossed that, or he was the difference between the teams.

If there is more than one retraction required, then they should be in order of their importance when they were published ie. front page article first, etc etc.

&gt; Not really. What about all of the ex-pats living in france, spain etc. If we quit the EU...

With the UK not forcing out current immigrants, I hadn't assumed that our ex-pats would be forced to return home. That is something I will look into. As with supply and demand causing house prices to drop, I can understand the concern many home owners would have with that, it isn't a great position to be in. Yet those on the other side looking for somewhere to live are likely not to care about people going into negative equity if they too can afford a house. It would need monitoring by the government to provide some form of balance I would hope.

&gt; Have you looked into the figures to support this?

Actually I haven't seen them yet, thanks for posting them here I will take a look at them.

&gt; His plan is to appeal to the idle who prefer to blame outsiders for our problems than accept that our own work ethic is the problem.

Covering both your points about cleaning floors and car washes - I totally agree with you there. I know of many people in Portsmouth who have been making a living collecting benefits for the past 7 years, becoming 'baby factories' on the way. Those people still have the mind set that a career is going to jump out at them even though they are unskilled and have little-no work experience. This is all whilst they turn their nose up at any job such as cleaning, waste collection and other jobs that they deem to be beneath them. So they sit at home sharing Britain First photos on Facebook, and one by one get deleted.

I personally do not feel any negativity towards immigrants. In Portsmouth at least, there are a great number of them who either take up jobs which need to be done as well as many that have an entrepreneurial spirit about them.

UKIP are still the only party I am confident about in terms of them implementing their policies. I will have more of a read into the issues you have raised though, as I do know that I am unaware of all the consequences of these policies and once again thank you for raising them.",null,0,null,1429263557,null,0,false,0,cqfb7ng,null,t3_32t3fu,null,t1_cqfb7ng,null,t1_cqf48yy,null,null,null,1432441892,null,1,false,Portsmouth,t5_2sjg1,1,null

**Channel 4 Fact Check (2010)**:  The fact the UKIP figure was based on a six-year old German analysis, which in itself had flaws, is enough to suggest this claim is a step too far. Clearly this is a complex issue, and difficult to prove, but there is a lack of evidence to suggest 75 per cent, or even half, of the UK’s laws now come from Brussels.

http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/RP10-62/how-much-legislation-comes-from-europe

**House of Parliament's own research** (2010): In the UK data suggest that from 1997 to 2009 6.8% of primary legislation (Statutes) and 14.1% of secondary legislation (Statutory Instruments) had a role in implementing EU obligations, although the degree of involvement varied from passing reference to explicit implementation.

[Here's a quick summary of the report from CityAM](http://www.cityam.com/1413208641/how-much-legislation-actually-comes-brussels)

[An interesting quote from FullFact.org about osme figures being thrown around](https://fullfact.org/europe/eu_make_uk_law-29587): 

&gt; Sometimes a figure of 70% is used — including in February 2014 by Viviane Reding, the Vice-President of the European Commission — but this is actually the percentage of *EU* laws that the European Parliament (elected representatives of each EU country) and the European Council (representatives of the governments of each EU country) have had an equal say on. The rest are either decided solely by the Council, or with Parliament giving the Council consent to them being passed. In other words, it’s the percentage of EU law that the politicians we elect to the European Parliament have as much say on as our national government.

[London School of Economics blog](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2012/06/13/europeanization-of-public-policy/):

&gt; We looked first at studies on Germany, the United Kingdom (UK), the Netherlands and Denmark. Others on France, Austria and Finland followed. The striking finding is that most of these studies showed rather low shares of Europeanized national legislation: 15.5 per cent for the UK, 14 per cent for Denmark, 10.6 per cent for Austria, between 3 and 27 per cent for France, between 1 and 24 per cent for Finland, yet 39.1 per cent for Germany.

[Article by Robert Ackrill, Professor of European Economics and Policy at Nottingham Trent University from last month](http://theconversation.com/five-myths-about-europe-that-need-busting-before-the-british-general-election-38810):

&gt; A common complaint is that the UK is overwhelmed with legislation from the EU. Yet a recent House of Commons report estimated that, at most, just 12.8% of UK laws even mention the EU. The percentage of laws that originate from Brussels will be less than this. For some reason, UKIP continue to quote the laughable figure of 75% despite this evidence.

If you were made aware of any issues with the bike and the fault is found to be a result of said issue then you are classed as being made fully aware. Forget phone recordings etc and make sure you read through the full description of the bike when it was sold to you.

One thing to note is to keep on side with this dealer. As bad as it sounds the mechanics (if they have any) may have missed something on the bike and the dealer may be more than willing to rectify this or offer a full refund. It may cost you about £100 to get the bike returned, and if you feel you do want a refund for the bike then it would be worth paying this and bargaining the dealer for an extra £100-£200 of a different bike. All in all you could save a decent packet and end up taking away a better bike.

Do not start legal threats or paperwork and please please give these guys a reasonable amount of time for correspondence and to rectify this issue. Try using email to talk to the guys and if need be phone to discuss what you have typed.

If the dealer does (and some do especially the pop up and leave loons) decide to not offer any support then make sure you have everything logged and ask for their decision in writing once again.

With regards to recovery, it is actually your responsibility to get the vehicle recovered to the dealer just as you would be expected to with a car, van or any other form of transport. The good faith sits with the dealer's willingness to have the bike rectified or a full refund given.

I would definitely ask them to troubleshoot the problem and let you know what it is. You can then get opinions of several mechanics in your area as to costs and likelyhood of failure again and if it is too great a risk then you can ask for a full refund.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; So anyway, back to the thing. First off, scanned my loyalty card (I'm not really loyal, it's just a marriage of convenience) and collected my phaser after I'd collected my trolley with my keyring mounted, ready-for-action trolley token and collected 200 B&amp;H Silver for the missus from the Death&amp;Gambling desk and deposited them in my disappointingly right-veering trolley and shot the shit out of my grocery shop. Celery? Pew! Passatta? Pew pew pew! What's this? Discounted cider because the box is fucked and held together with duct-tape? MEGA PEW! Also some socks and other things. It ended up totaling about 150 quid. I got carried away, I know.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; So, having gotten at least one of virtually everything they sell, I make my way to the Pen of Privilege. This is where I sail my laden trolley away from the common folk who's items are touched and scanned by a human, and instead interact with a screen and return my food-pewer, throw my card into the machine and skip off.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; But no. Today I was selected for a random service check. The willowy pale beauty that descended from ceiling panels explained that she'd only be a moment and started rummaging through my shopping. Not a problem I pointed out, and stood back to let her take charge of my things. It doesn't add much to the story, but she was quite pretty and had a cracking bum. She scanned the first thing, the box of cider. But she didn't scan the yellow reduced label, she scanned the normal barcode which set of imaginary klaxons wailing, red lights and riot squad bursting in from the staff room. I immediately informed her of her mistake, she blushed a bit telling me she'd now have to check the lot as that's what the system required. Probably should have told you that from the out, as much my mistake as yours, really not a problem. So, she goes and does the lot without a problem and then tells me it's done and I can pay. But... my shopping in now 235 quid. I ask her what that's about and she's genuinely excited, perhaps thinking that she had after all caught a very clever thief. Or maybe it was just the most interesting thing that had happened since lunch idk.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; As it turns out, she'd just scanned the 200 fags as well. Double fail, and undoubtedly a giant red blot on my otherwise exemplary scan&amp;shop record. She rectified it after having taken a moment to blush a bit more.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; So, now we fast forward to present day. I've since attempted to use the pewer a few more times (4) and each time I get a full shop check. Meaning someone has to unpack everything I've previously packed and meticulously, anally placed into their correct bags to correspond to my kitchen cupboards and rummage through everything on a special shelf made for bandits and thieves to stand in front of in shame and embarrassment and costs me time and frowns.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; So, I outlined the problem to Tesco, and gave them a thorough run-down of my dissatisfaction in relation to my embarrassment and wasted time to which I was given a scripted 'this is random and shouldn't happen don't worry about it response'. No. No Colin, it's not random if it happens 100% of the time. I just want you people to make it stop.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; So, I shall ramp up my complaint. I also want some vouchers or something. I'm not sure I'll get them but I'll make sure to use lots of adverbs and adjectives to outline my fury in the next email so they'll have to resort to giving me something and bending to my wishes.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I'm also just going to get a new clubcard in the meantime, probably under a completely stupid name. Maybe my old facebook name of Buxton Wilberforce VonFlabberghast. No point searching that by the way, that account died about 6 months ago.

Reasons I shop online are above.

I agree with you that immigrants aren't the cause of our problems.

Since taking more of an interest, I realise that the biggest issues are that of the rich and the big corporations avoiding tax. The rewards from fixing that are outweigh making the lives of the poorer even more difficult (even if some to cheat the system).

Two of the parties, Torys and UKIP would seek to widen inequality by reducing taxes and allowing the abuse of loopholes. Labour and the Lib Dems have made minor pledges to try and close down things such as the 'non domicile' tax loophole but this is a drop in the ocean compared to the magnitude of the problem. Although I will admit that it is a step in the right direction. 

We can see from the handling of the HSBC scandal a couple of months ago that noone is really being punished for huge tax avoidance. Some people are dodging millions in tax and are simply being fined, there is yet to be any significant imprisonments for any of them. Terrible considering the sums of money we are talking about. 

There is no point, as you put it, trying to fix the problems left by it. All it will cause is more social tensions, more discrimination against minorities and more hatred and blaming them for problems they are not responsible for! We need to tackle the root of the issue head on.

Right now the only party making significant attempts to cover the real problems are the Greens. Fortunately this election provides the first real time where a vote for them could make a difference, due to the splintering of consensus. We have to examine our countries long term future, and so may have to look past this election to see concrete progress, but by getting the ball rolling this election, people will begin to realise that the Green Party are a viable choice and the only one that is not cluttered with City bankers.

To answer your questions:

1) Yes, I never used to buy anything on credit, being brought up on the idea of 'if you can't afford it you can't have it'. This means you have no credit history which doesn't give bank or lenders much confidence.

2) Get a credit card with your current bank and set up a direct debit to pay off the balance when required. (This will pay off the credit balance just before the interest hits you automatically). I did this through Lloyds Bank and it was amazingly simple. No extra cost and I now have a credit card for online shopping. Then whenever you buy something online just use your credit card.

Then a club may have a certain established scouting network that may then be able to work under the new coach, compare data but ultimately concentrate their efforts on the list of players that the scouting group of the coach has compiled. This way, the coach is getting the player only he wants and only he thinks are able to contribute/play to/in his system. 

Of course every buy has to be affirmed by someone higher up in the club, due to the costs involved, but that's always been the case, no need for a special ""transfer comittee"". 

The exact opposite of that is what Hamburger SV is currently doing: they have a manager (football director if you want) who buys and sells players on his accord. He may or may not discuss this business with the headcoach. As a result, the players that come in are all very good footballers but don't fit together. And as an ultimate result, no matter the headcoach, the team will fuck up. 

Liverpool is currently doing something in between. They have a headcoach in Rodgers who can suggest the players he wants to the comittee. They may or may not choose to buy them. Also the comittee is entitled to buy players without the headcoaches consent, as the Balotelli transfer seems to suggest. In my opinion, this is no recipe for success.

The Idea didn't really take off in England but luckily the 1641 rebellion happened in Ireland and the English admin over exaggerated the rebellion and pushed Anti-Popery which flourished among the already Sectarian planters.

As someone new to politics, if I had only seen the TV debates I would have thought that the greens appear to be out of their depth - in the debates at least. Farage and Natalie Bennett(?) from the SNP appear to be hard arses, sticking to their guns. Milliband makes me feel depressed about our situation rather than making me feel confident that he can solve anything, and no amount of comparing himself to Cameron will change that. David, lets say I agree with all of the positive things he has done in office, thats fine.

I've never had need to grumble with them. They could have charged me an hours labour to fill, charge and fit a new battery - perfectly within their rights to do so - but they didn't. Just charged me the RRP for the battery. Could have charged me an hours labour to diagnose and look at my recent knocking noise too. But they didn't. Just a friendly chat minutes after they opened one morning, quick trip up onto their paddock stand and hey presto - I've just had absolutely stellar service by a garage which will definitely get my custom again!

In all seriousness: 

- ask for a rapid reclaim when you do go to the JC - that will cut the waiting time significantly. Keep a written record of everything and make sure the council are kept in the loop at all times.
- if you're struggling for food you can ask the JC advisor for foodbank vouchers; your local council may also be able to provide this, search ""&lt;council name&gt; crisis grants""
- if you're struggling for electric and are on a meter, local CAB/social work can often persuade electricity companies to ""loan"" you extra meter credit

You are not really sacrificing time, since you are learning and you never know how that learning will be applicable to you, say 5-10 years from now. It is a privilege that is easily accessible to you (since you are living in a first world country) and you should take advantage of it. One thing I will add is that if you do decide to go for it, then you must stick through it till the end, else it will be truly wasted.

The issue was that Gordon Brown's automatic assumption was that Duffy was bigoted, not that she was expressing genuine concern about the effect of immigration on working class people. It was symbolic of Labour's general attitude to immigration at that point; which was to dismiss working class concerns as driven by bigotry or racism, not concern over the effect of immigration on their living and working conditions and quality of public services.

Thankfully, Labour (or Ed Milliband at least) seems to have moved on from that position and recognises that people who express concern over immigration are not necessarily bigoted / xenophobic / racist.",null,0,null,1429270161,null,0,false,0,cqfcscx,null,t3_32t1mp,null,t1_cqfcscx,null,t1_cqfbkl3,null,null,null,1432442635,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

null,false,MrFuckingRandom,null,null,null,"The fact that students spend the majority of the year  at uni  is partly debatable. It's more like half. As a uni  student myself, etching only goes from September to November, and January to March. December is exams as is April/May, but most students go home for the majority of these months because it's the holidays.

The argument could be made regarding the youth vote, but it's not as strong. Firstly, it depends where the constituency is as to whether it would be more right-leaning. I'm in Scotland, so that's not true for any constituency apart from Dumfries and Galloway. Secondly, yes, there's a certain liberalism amongst youth as a whole but there is also a strong trend that young voters - at least while at home under the influence of parents - vote the same way as their parents, so the extent to which they unfairly affect an election is lessened slightly.  Their effect is further lessened by the strong presumption that students will return to their constituency/parents home, at least for a time after the academic year/graduation while they look for a job. This would be especially true in the current economic climate with a shortage of housing and difficulty in obtaining mortgages to buy.

Tactical voting to me is  both strange but understandable. It annoys me that you should have to vote for a separate  party's candidate in order to, in effect, vote for the party you want in government.  Thus,  perhaps voting Green keeps out a Tory candidate which will, in effect, result in a Labour government. I don't have as much of an issue with this as the dual residence voting, because no matter which way you vote, you're still voting  in essence for the same party to govern but more importantly, you can only affect the result in one constituency.  Yes, that constituency may end up with a Green, but if they did so because Labour was  impossible, then it's stands that the community as a whole was ideologically opposed to a Conservative MP, and a Green is more appropriate. I'll give you an example.:

If, in constituency X, the conservatives have 36%, the Greens have 30% and Labour have 25%. There is a 9% outstanding. These are our voters considering voting Labour. However, if they do so, Labour gets 34% overall and the conservatives win. However, this does not represent the  constituency well because 64% (labours 34 and Greens 34)  voted Left yet the 36% minority won. If on the other hand, the prospective Labour voters go Green, then Green get 39% and they win. The constituency gets a left-leaning candidate which represents them better ideologically, and they pray it wasn't Natalie Bennett that was running. 

Tactical voting is a roundabout way of imposing the ideological majority of a constituency, but where one side (Left or right) are split as to which party to vote for, and the other side is new consolidated. For instance, you would repeat the above situation, swapping Labour and Greens for Conservatives and UKIP and Conservatives for Labour and it's the same idea.

null,false,ratatooie,,I don't have a bike,null,"Insurance based on age is a good point that I hadn't considered. Put on your parents until you can get your own or reach the age of 17? I'd have to flesh that out more. Or allow only kids to use the pavement and make insurance only for road use. I think in principle it is a good idea. It wouldn't be particularly expensive in any event unless you had a push bike worth ££££, in which case cost evidently isn't an issue anyway. Insurance would go a good way to protect those poorer people if they do come off with a payout of some money.  Club based insurance would be a good way (for those large group rides). The 1 sided nature of claims and therefore liability needs to be sorted. It shouldn't as a default be the car/biker's insurance that gets hammered.

2 abreast. Where does the cyclist's right to use the road derive from? Genuine question. The 2 abreast rule is necessary. I wouldn't ride like that with a motorbike, because you have immediately halved your potential avoidance swerve area that you can use and be sure of not serving into another. The haphazard nature of the way that a push bike moves while it is being peddled hard adds to this. My main issue here is that where I live, roads go from a 30 or 40 directly to no speed limits. Obviously you drive to the conditions and visibility you have, but it effectively translates to everyone going about 60 on winding single carriageway roads. This means that you very suddenly come to cyclists. The no 2 abreast rule means that they go from a genuine hazard that you have to go completely into oncoming traffic to avoid (speaking as a biker) rather than weaving around one and still staying in the correct lane. If you slow down behind them, you immediately put yourself in much more danger from behind (again from cars or bikes potentially doing a ton or more). So perhaps the no 2 up rule should be extended to roads over Xmph limit. It's not about annoyance for me really, more safety (my own being paramount).

Visibility. I would have no problem with every bit of motorbike gear having mandatory hi viz bits (many already do) and my most recent jacket was bought with this as a requirement. You solve the problem gradually if you implement it at point of manufacture. Make lights a legal requirement at all times. I'm sure I've read studies that show lights on during the day greatly increase visibility. Cyclists are next to invisible at night as it is. How would you increase visibility?

Accountability. How would you do it? I think you put too much weight on the cost element. Even a car plate brand new costs only ~£10. Stickers are pennies. Anything more than walking is going to cost money, that's just life. Either bike ID with a list of riders or a rider ID prominently displayed. It's no more Orwellian than current license plates.

Nothing I've advocated for is about punishment, rather added safety and accountability. It would lessen the ""us v them"" attitude from both sides.

My experience from those subjects (woodworking, electronics and metalwork) was that they were all individually taught subjects, not all in one. Certainly not under PD anyway and you couldn't master them all in a degree or A-level to an appropriate stage where you can do anything useful with it. 

Would a technical role suit you better? You can go to schools for woodworking and so on, though not all three. I'm of the opinion that you're going to hate teaching DT as you won't ever get to do personal stuff.

PD is for designers that generally don't make things that can really work in the final realisation and is all a bit abstract as that is what they're hired to do. To do all that and and have the skills for the real final part, those subjects are Product Design Engineering or Design engineering. 

PD is about the aesthetics, ergonomics and general invention found in a product. Design engineering and those in that field are what takes that and makes it real through design skills and engineering knowledge/experience. Unless you work in a consultancy (or in my case R&amp;D) you're going to be specialising and may not even get your hands dirty.

Also with PD you don't just do the subject and at the end get a diploma. You choose your speciality and have modules around that. I did industrial and transportation. Depending on your uni choice you could specialise in Furniture design which would give you modules that allow for woodworking and metal work. Even electronics if you go wild in an idea. Remember just because you did it at Uni doesn't mean that is exactly what you have to do for work. Can quite easily apply those skills to your area of choice. Just make sure you know what you want from the start.

3 years is a very short time, first year uni tends to be unteaching all the rubbish from A-levels and getting you up to speed. 2nd year is where it really starts and third year throws you into the deep end.

It's not that hard to get tickets to a sold out show there so I go on Craig's list and find a guy who is selling. 

We meet after work and I pull out my Spurs wallet to pay him and he sees it. He asks if I support Spurs (obviously, it's on my wallet) and we talk for a minute or two. He said that he watches Spurs at the Irish Channel in Chinatown and I do too so I told him I would say hi next match and went on my merry way. 

I get to the show and it's my turn to buy the next round of beers. I go up to the bar and pull out my wallet and wouldn't Ledley know it...the same thing happened. The bartender yelled ""I support Spurs too!"" And we did a weird high five fist bump thing. He only charged me for two of the three beers (but I tipped him to make up the difference) and said I would say hi if he's at the channel watching a match. 

That's my story I just thought I'd share here because it was just one of ""those things"" and didn't know who else would find it a cool story.

Why do they want out of Europe? They feel that UK is paying a disproportionate amount of money into European government, and also feel that European policy is detrimental to the country.

The first point is debatable, I would certainly disagree, but it is a valid argument. The second serves only to remove the sanity checks that Europe places on businesses. Things like the working time directive, human rights etc. THAT is what UKIP want away from.

But they don't say that, because then only a complete idiot would vote for them. SO they tell you that immigration is the problem, That we have so many immigrants because of free travel arrangements within European countries. That way they appeal to the Daily Mail readership and the EDL types. Of course we should totally ignore that Farage is married to an immigrant who he would have absolutely NO intention of deporting, and that he employs her as his secretary (obviously a job no UK born person could ever do).

The overwhelming majority of European immigrants are hard working, productive and are paying much more in tax than they are costing.Weeding out the few that are not would cost way more money than it would save.

But you still have those that couldn't afford it, even if it was cheap.  
Particularly those out of work and on benefits [or, increasingly so, those in low paid work and still on benefits who can't afford any other form of transport]

Roads pre-date cars, and bicycles are classed as carriages [due to a court case in 1878]  
Further for the 2 abreast is that these come from a ""should"" clause in the highway code. [Rule 66](https://www.gov.uk/rules-for-cyclists-59-to-82) has ""you should ... never ride more than two abreast, and ride in single file on narrow or busy roads and when riding round bends"", which means there is nothing to legally prevent even 3 abreast. Although you may get a telling off.  
Here's a site with further info: http://ukcyclelaws.blogspot.co.uk/p/the-laws-according-to-highway-code.html

Visibility:  
The point is, beyond a reasonable level [lights when dark], visibility should not be the responsibility of the rider. They can *choose* to enhance it via hi-vis or similar, but the responsibility is for other road users to actually pay attention!  
Yes, that doesn't help when they don't, and we end up injured, but we cannot mandate on hi-vis. Especially since it only has limited use, and in some circumstances can actually be counterproductive. [It's all about contrast, not whether you glow...]  
Flashing LED lights are fantastic for night time cyclists though - they are very noticeable.  
And lights on during the day are becoming less useful now that every bastarding car is doing it too. People stop paying special attention to them when they become the norm.

Accountability: I honestly don't know how it could be done. But the cost involved is also for the set up of any system. Which would not be cheap.

I also saw someone mention that there simply isn't the equipment in the UK to have that many of these set up at once. Surely, the business move for this would be to have one set of equipment and move it around the UK for the events on different days?

Also: Their website. It says absolutely nothing. There is nothing but a form to capture details, a couple of email addresses and links to social media. Absolutely nothing else. No 'about us' page, no address, no Cookies disclaimer (a legal EU requirement btw), no business name, absolutely NOTHING apart from a form to capture details.

EDIT: They've now updated their website with a privacy policy and a cookies policy. It does seem like it was a brand new start up that got much more attention than expected. However their privacy policy does sound dubious:

**Your opinion**: In general pretty good - I was going for an alternative to Asian sunscreens, so wanted something lightweight, with a nice finish and properly hydrating. Occasionally patches of my face would feel (but not look) a bit dry, specifically the chin/around the mouth, which aren't typical problem areas.

The fragrance was actually pleasant, that was a nice suprise. It's kind of fruity rather than florally and didn't seem to negatively impact my skin like they usually do. The finish wasn't matte but wasn't greasy (unlike my experience with LRP and Bioderma).

I don't think it's worth the price unless you get it 3 for 2 and collect Advantage card points. The Asian sunscreens I'm trying to replicate would probably be cheaper, even with shipping!

Android uses three main methods to determine your location.

1. The GPS chip - this uses battery quite quickly, so they often fall back on...
2. The Cell Tower ID.  Google has a big database which says ""If I'm connected to ID 123, the phone is in Derby Town Centre.""
3. The phone will periodically scan for WiFi signals *even if the WiFi is switched off*.  Google has a similar database to match WiFi IDs with location.

At some point, your phone has passively scanned a WiFi hotspot with the same ID as one used in Pakistan.  It could be that they both have the same MAC address / SSID - or it could have been brought back by someone.

In all honesty, there's not much you can do about it.  Once Google Maps sees the GPS satellites it *should* report your location back to Google &amp; they can update their database.

Could have saved a lot of time if the author had just come out and said it rather than taking us on their anti Tory mantra and biased history lesson.

Here it is to save people some time:

&gt;It has been suggested they are worthy of working for less than the minimum wage. They’ve had benefits cuts and been subjected to humiliating medical examination by incompetent private sector assessors to prove their entitlement. The Access to Work budget has been slashed at the same time as the Tories have been telling us there will be jobs for everyone. Hearing aid provision has been cut. 

I'm not going to defend it except for this one:

&gt;It has been suggested they are worthy of working for less than the minimum wage. 

The suggestion was from a Tory minister with a genuine motive, considering that disabled workers could be employed for less than the minimum wage and the balance subsidised by the government. Heart in the right place but a bit of a PR gaff. There really was nothing in this.

As for the other stuff. It can't be effective defended. I have a blind mother (not partially blind totally blind) who has had her life time DLA award taken away and a threat on her mobility allowance as she has been blind long enough she should have leaned to adapt. Unfortunately she hasn't adapted enough to be able to drive a car or take her guide dog on a route she is unfamiliar with. This government needs to get to grips with disabled peoples lives and their this appalling approach to it and not leave it in the hands of private firms with target's to hit.

Oh man I used to watch reggie yates on smile on bbc2 I'm not sure how I feel about him confronting neo nazis and stuff. 

I mean I know that nazi iconography is used pretty self servingly by racist ultra nationalist groups all across the world, but shit it was bonkers to see Russians do nazi salutes and have faux nazi flags. What shit has to go down so that you get a Russian Nazi, and a Nazi member of the 'slavic union' aswell. I mean didn't the actual Nazis have slavs as 3rd on their list of people who should be wiped out behind jewish people and gypsies, I'm pretty sure they at least aimed to murder two thirds of the population of slavs across Europe and have the rest as slaves. I mean Hitler'd be turning in his grave (if he had one). 

I thought overall it was like a strange cross between the 'stacey dooley investigates' type stuff, where a lot of the 'entertainment' of the show comes from her personality and naive reactions to stuff, a louis theroux style documentary, where he tries to subtly get human interest as well as cringe out of people with faux naivety, and an actual proper one person piece of investigative journalism. 

It was part of the narrative that the kind of odd nationalism of SET was some huge organisation, but  he says himself that SET has thousands of people so I think it was overblowing it a little, but it's still popular. The only thing I could find on the russian scary russian action bronson/david brent and russian gareth with his knives was that their party 'Russkiye' ""[boasts tens-of-thousands of members](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2014/11/russian-march-draws-thousands-haters-2014114161437560714.html)"" so not exactly mussolini here. But also on the other hand what he said about 80% of Moscovites favoring kicking all non russian workers out and that
&gt;A poll conducted in early October showed 54 percent of Russians support the idea of ""Russia for ethnic Russians"", who account for about 80 percent of the country's population of 142 million

I think that the brent group has very little chance of getting into power though, because they seem (from all of the arrests etc) to have little or no institutional support (one of the reasons the documentary could go ahead imo). I guess you could argue that the attacks on immigrants are in the interests of employers who want a scared and compliant cheap labour force though. I think it's going a long way before they get to the level of other far right east european parties that have actually taken power. 

So it was kind of not giving a proper picture of what's going on in that way, and I thought it chose scary action bronson/david brent guy over really looking at the reasons behind the growth of nationalism in Russia; like unemployment and poverty, low wages and poor services etc that seem to be associated with rising resentment of 'outgroups' almost everywhere. Also the stuff that preceded it, i.e. Yeltsin and a demographic and economic disaster, and NATO expansion into the old Warsaw pact (which apparently went against either an explicit or tacit guarantee  to Gorbachev not to) and that Ultra nationalism has been fermented as a way to distract from the obvious problems and divisions of the country  to provide a sense of community and a convenient enemy etc.  It's kind of understandable why Russians love Putin so much because he arrested that slide into chaos somewhat. 

&gt;I also found it strange that Putin has so much support, is this something worrying for the rest of the world, considering the strength Russia has. Is this something that could potentially effect all of us, in terms of another world war?

imo there is almost no chance of a major war. The aim of russian nationalism is mostly domestic, something similar has been going on in other places in Eastern/central Europe and also China since the end of the Tiananmen square turmoil.  And the stuff in Ukraine is a result of russian weakness, both economically and militarily, with the EU and NATO encroaching on the some of the inner parts of the traditional russian 'sphere of influence' and Russia 'drawing a line' in a scumbag, sloppy and bloody way, but everybody knows that the stakes are too high for a major war. This is a totally different situation to (only example I can think of sorry) Germany in the 30's which had an explicit aim to dominate Europe and was amassing an unprecedentedly large, modern army and air force or, even Italy in that period. I think that people say that more small and/or 'low intensity' conflicts are likely in the states bordering Russia though.

I feel like he lacks a little bit of cutting edge though.  It's probably inexperience more than anything.  BR is quite young for a manager and before we picked him up he had ONE season managing in the top flight.  He's still incredibly raw as a manager and he has a ton of developing to do.  I think this is part of his charm though, it feels like he's along for the ride like we all are, learning with the team and supporters from game to game to try and put us back on the map.

Here's the thing though: Can we afford to, and do we want to, wait and see if BR develops into the proper trophy winning manager we need to have leading the club?  If you ask me, I think he'll get there, but we're at least a couple of seasons (and good transfer windows) off from that yet. 

There aren't very many managers out there I'd want to come in an replace Rodgers and of those few pretty much all of them are obviously unavailable for any number of reasons. But Klopp is definitely one of those few and now he could potentially be available.  Klopp's a young, innovative manager with an extremely likable personality on him who does very well with young players just like BR.  But Klopp also brings experience at the very top level of competition with him as well as a nice precedent of success and trophies.

Not sure a pure EV is really going to be much use for you with that kind of daily mileage. At least not until they increase the range.

The Nissan Leaf is currently the most popular EV which is technically supposed to do 130 miles per charge but in reality it's more like 80, and if it gets cold, much much less.

null,false,colondee,null,null,null,"Well it depends whether you think you will use up all future years' ISA allowances and when you think interest rates will rise.

If my ISA rate is 1.5% and current account rates are 4%, then I would think that I should keep my money outside ISAs.

But suppose that I think in 3 years time my ISA rate will be 3% and current account rates will be 3%. Then I could have saved £280 in tax that year, if my ISA balance was £47000. But that would have required me to put in £15K each year, missing out on the higher current account interest (taxed) in the first 2 years. If I hadn't put any money into ISAs, then it would take 3 years from that point to put £47K in, and perhaps the ISA rate would overtake the current account rate afterwards, meaning I would have lost out on potential interest in the ISA whilst waiting to be allowed to subscribe the next year.

But now that you can subscribe 3x as much as you used to be able to, many people won't be able to maximise their ISA usage. If you only have £15K of savings, then you can dump all of it into an ISA at any time. So you might as well keep it outside of ISAs until the ISA rate beats the net rate of another account. If you only have £30K of savings, then you'd have to wait at most 12 months to put all of it into ISAs, so it depends on where you see the rate going in the next 6-12 months.

&gt;The paper's nickname ___The Grauniad___ (sometimes abbreviated as ""Graun"") originated with the satirical magazine *[Private Eye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Eye_(magazine\))*.  This [anagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram) played on *The Guardian's* early reputation for frequent [typographical errors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographical_error), including misspelling its own name as *The Gaurdian*.  This good-humoured argument was perhaps played because *Private Eye* itself is renowned for its terrible typography.

Now, within nationalism there is a spectrum, from right to left. This is due to the fact that some nationalists feel that their country needs to become the best it can be utilising the people within it and others see this in a similar way but also as an excuse not to share. So as UKIP may be the former of these two, it also attracts the latter, which 'dirties the water' so to speak. Meaning its hard to see the clean folk from the dirty.

Coutinho------Borini-------Sterling

Subs: Jones, Toure, Manquillo, Gerrard, Allen, Markovic, Balotelli


For all the good we did with Coutinho as a false 9 against , we just looked more dangerous once we had an actual striker on the pitch looking to stretch play.  I chose Borini over Balotelli because Borini will lean on their defenders, make positive runs, and stretch them out whereas Balo will tend to stay more static or drop deep.  Coutinho lines up on the right but really has quite a bit of freedom to float around and just do what he does best.

Can goes into the midfield and Lovren stays in defense because Can will just get absolutely wrecked by Benteke if he plays as a CB in this one (same way Fellaini worked him over).  I think Can offers a bit more dynamic play than Allen does as well, which will come in very handy since Villa play a pretty energetic midfield game and will look to keep things pretty open.
