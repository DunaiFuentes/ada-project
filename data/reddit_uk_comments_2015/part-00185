In an otherwise shitty season, Henderson has probably shown the most improvement in his all round game, along with Phil. His passing has come on leaps and bounds. My only gripe with him this season is probably that he hasn't been making as many of those forwards runs, getting ahead of the striker and into the box as I'd like to see as we saw last season. However I think he's been stifled in that area because of a lack of a decent/top striker in the team.

This idea sort of got derailed with the introduction of the Daleks, but it's still fairly obvious in the first season or two.

There have also been several instances where critics/studio heads have told the writers to tone down the darker aspects of the show, which were starting to seriously frighten children and have an effect on ratings.

This season has only indicated that we need a marauding tenacious player in the Suarez mould for our style to work. For central midfielders to be truly effective, they need players who can finish the chances they create. Liverpool lacks that. However, there have been multiple instances this season where Henderson has shown he retains the ability he displayed last season, and, additionally, I believe this has been his highest scoring season. He's also still very young. I think that if Liverpool can add an experienced striker, a la Tevez, Martinez, or Lacazette (a bit less experienced here) then we will see a dramatic increase in the team's offensive output, and players like Henderson will show more because the chances they create will be finished at a higher rate, and they will have more space in front of them to take their own chances, as all three of the strikers I described will stretch and contort defenses. Henderson should not be a scapegoat for the season, nor should Brendan Rodgers, in fact, it is the owners' fault, because at the end of the day, what keeps us from signing world class players is the inability to offer them the same kinds of contracts as the top teams in the Premier League and in Europe.

like I said, I have watched sterling since he joined the academy. he is FAR from being a pace merchant. he has great close control, good vision, strength, and he actually gets himself in goal scoring positions when he is played up top. he also creates chances for others. HE IS NOT JUST PACE. go watch some videos objectively.

rodgers has fukt about and put him in 5,6 different positions, which is going to have impacted his performance. seriously go have a look at how rodgers has handled him and the mindfuck amount of positions and areas he has put him in. one week he is creating chances uptop at cf, then he is shifted out to the right wingback position. 

fuk man, i could go on and on. but youre just fucking hiding your bias in a politely framed conversation. look at the body of work rather than the months since this whole contract speculation bullshit.

While I have this biased view, I can watch all the videos of him playing great but my conscious will still not register it.
If you really want, I can go watch as many videos AS I can in a couple of hours...but our discussion would not mean anything as my views would still be biased.
Unless you want me to spend a couple of hours watching him play, we can go over this in an hour or so?

Edit: English players do have a hype attached to them. This is not my bias.

&gt;

&gt;The __BBC Radiophonic Workshop__, one of the [sound effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_effect) units of the [BBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC), was created in 1958 to produce effects and new music for [radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio). It was closed in March 1998, although much of its traditional work had already been outsourced by 1995.  The original Radiophonic Workshop was based in the BBC's [Maida Vale Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maida_Vale_Studios) in Delaware Road, [London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London).

&gt;

&gt;Most of the innovative incidental music for *Doctor Who* has been specially commissioned from freelance composers, although in the early years some episodes also used [stock music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royalty_free_music), as well as occasional excerpts from original recordings or [cover versions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version) of songs by popular music acts such as [The Beatles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles) and [The Beach Boys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beach_Boys). Since its 2005 return, the series has featured occasional use of excerpts of pop music from the 1970s to the 2000s.

&gt;The incidental music for the first *Doctor Who* adventure, *An Unearthly Child*, was written by [Norman Kay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Kay_(composer\)). Many of the stories of the [William Hartnell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Hartnell) period were scored by electronic music pioneer [Tristram Cary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tristram_Cary), whose *Doctor Who* credits include *The Daleks*, *[Marco Polo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Polo_(Doctor_Who\))*, *The Daleks' Master Plan*, *The Gunfighters* and *[The Mutants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mutants)*. Other composers in this early period included [Richard Rodney Bennett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Rodney_Bennett), [Carey Blyton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carey_Blyton) and [Geoffrey Burgon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Burgon).

&gt;The most frequent musical contributor during the first 15 years was [Dudley Simpson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dudley_Simpson), who is also well known for his theme and incidental music for *[Blake's 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake%27s_7)*, and for his haunting theme music and score for the original 1970s version of *[The Tomorrow People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tomorrow_People)*. Simpson's first *Doctor Who* score was *[Planet of Giants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_of_Giants)* (1964) and he went on to write music for many adventures of the 1960s and 1970s, including most of the stories of the Jon Pertwee/Tom Baker periods, ending with *[The Horns of Nimon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Horns_of_Nimon)* (1979). He also made a [cameo appearance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance) in *The Talons of Weng-Chiang* (as a [Music hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_hall) conductor).

Firstly, on today's variable-width, and often quite wide monitors, full-width text is a bad idea because you need the vertical spacing of lines to be proportional to the width, because readability demands that the eye does not have too shallow an angle to traverse when tracking lines.

Secondly, relying on user agent default fonts is unwise because many operating systems choose serif fonts that display poorly on the typically low pixel densities of most desktop monitors. You really need retina-like resolutions to make those serif edges distinct; your aunt's bog-standard laptop isn't going to handle them well.

The crux of the issue isn't about competence in terms of the playing squad and staff. It's a legacy issue from years of financial mismanagement that mean that the club as a whole is not in a position where it's likely to challenge for trophies, and even less likely to challenge for trophies that matter.

That's an issue with the sort of results based thinking that a lot of people are going for - 1st is 1st and 2nd is nowhere sort of thing. We don't have the right to think like that about a club who's generally finished around 4/5 over the past 25 years and finished 7/8 between 09/10 and last season. 

&gt;Are we as a club better off than when Rodgers took over?

Is the real question but I don't see how anyone in their right mind could argue that we're not, at least as long as they allow for the fact that a club in our position having a player like Suarez isn't something we can maintain.

In results-based terms, we're going to finish on more points, presumably with a higher league position.

In terms of the squad, last season showed what many of these players can do, and they've only been added to.
Some have disappointed, but they likely won't forever - Markovic, Moreno and other youngsters aren't like signing a Jovanovic or a Joe Cole - we won't have to pay them to leave, they're not on stupidly high contracts, they've a long time to improve and so on.

On the whole, despite what some gobshites are saying because they're having a tantrum, the squad doesn't need wholesale change. It needs to strengthen a couple of crucial positions, as is evidenced by the fact that having a worse squad with those 2 strikers brought on a title challenge.

If that calibre = title challenge, then hopefully a fit Sturridge, a very good player (not as good as Suarez) and a better supporting cast than Borini, Balotelli and Lambert = 75pts and a very strong case to be in the CL.

But not about the economy. They mostly just claimed it was a global recession that was out of their control.

&gt;Meanwhile the Tories couldn't even answer if they thought zero-hour-contracts were something people could actually live on.

I only saw that asked once and it was phrased far more stupidly. Cameron was asked if he could personally live on a zero hour contract. The reason it was stupid was if he said yes, Paxman would no doubt have found one of the small number of zero hour horror stories and twisted it to claim that the prime minister is out of touch. If he said no it would have been seen as an admission that zero hour contracts are evil but Cameron doesn't care.

[The actual truth is that people on zero hour contracts tend to be just as happy as those in standard contracts.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-25098984) That is some people have a shit time but most are fine with their jobs.

Your view is in line with a large percentage of this sub which is the reason I was at first hesitant to make this post hence the small note at the beginning.

Analysis has a long future, though not necessarily through printed means. The business classes will always want analysis of the world - as interpreting the world will give them a competitive advantage. People that work in other areas will not have as much of a financial advantage to subscribing to newspapers that specialise in analysis (obviously there are people who are just interested in the world anyway - but their numbers are going to be lost to articles on the internet more easily, as they don't have the caution when finding new sources that goes with financial interests.) Looking at the Economist reading figures for example, their circulation has increased from 1 million in 2000 to 1.5 million in 2012, which shows how important analysis is now.

Opinion is harder to categorise. In general opinion is split into two groups, those the target market already agrees with, and those the target market really hates. For example if you read the Guardian, you are generally left wing. reading the opinions their that you agree with makes you trust the newspaper even more. It gives you more left wing opinion, which you agree with so you keep buying the newspaper and enjoying having your opinion validated on a national newspaper.

Reminder that each candidate needs 15% of sitting MPs to nominate them to get on the ballot paper. Like I said elsewhere, I did wonder if Umunna would manage to scrape together the numbers considering the more popular Kendall will be looking for nominations from the same group of Progress-minded MPs.

&gt;Worryingly for Tristram Hunt, who is yet to announce his candidacy officially, the shadow Education Secretary polled just 3 per cent among the defeated parliamentary candidates. 

And by the same token, I think that's your answer as to why Hunt hasn't officially declared yet. He stand more of a chance now that Umunna's supporters are back up for grabs, but I'm still doubtful. Considering the lack of enthusiasm for him both in the PLP and in the general membership, I wouldn't be pushing it too hard if I were him.

the original plan was that we'd continue at WHL and for one season play in a half completed Naming Rights Stadium (or a half destroyed WHL, I can't remember which way around it was) but that was deemed unfeasible with the newest building plans, I imagine they'll still start laying down some of the work next season so that there are less chances of any delay.

But given that they have commitments to season ticket holders, they can't move us to a new temporary stadium without giving some kind of consultation about where it is etc and giving people the option to opt out for a year.

null,false,Bosola,null,null,null,"Politics is politics and I don't know how the BBC would handle a disastrous launch, but I expect the pressure they're under to deliver 'value' from an increasingly hostile press means a wonky website would be something of a political liability. Given the site's use of analytics tracking, what I would *imagine* is that the BBC is going to give the new site a 'settling in period' whilst users get over the change, then will look at various metrics to see which have improved and which have regressed in the new design. Regressions will go into analysis - someone will investigate why they've happened - and then typically design will offer multiple solutions that are tried out in parallel as part of a multivariate test. Different users will see different solutions and their metrics will be watched to see how things do or don't improve. Most tracking solutions log user agents, so if the issues are specifically on desktop, I would expect the team to pick that up. 

Responsive design means design can be tweaked on different devices separately, so it's entirely possible for the BBC team to enhance the desktop experience if that is indeed where the new design is lacking (it's also possible the design has some other, more glaring deficiency that no-one anticipated, and this is why ""agile"" practice promotes deploying 'rough' designs and then using real world data to validate them, rather than Big Upfront Design that usually misses a blind spot no matter how Big and Upfront we make it).

Honestly, given the agilist tastes of modern software development I would be very surprised if this was supposed to be a finished product. It's much more likely the Been want to try things out gingerly and then refine them as and when they prove not to be disasters. This kind of iterative delivery keeps risk low and prevents organisations following the sort of sunk cost fallacy you believe the BBC will fall prey to.

I don't know if the Beeb is an agilist shop first hand, of course, but this is an industry I've been working in for a fair while, and I can tell you that these are the common practices in this area. It would be surprising if the BBC eschewed them due to size - from what I've heard from people who have worked there, the BBC likes to keep its digital teams split into small units with quite a tight focus on an individual product apiece.",null,0,null,1431857168,null,0,1431857460,0,crbte09,null,t3_366e80,null,t1_crbte09,null,t1_crbt6zt,null,null,null,1433109980,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Do you honestly think Jamie Carragher was ever a better player than Henderson in their respective positions??? Carragher is a legend precisely for being the type of player Hendo is. A hardworker who puts in a shift but isn't amazing. Reina is the same. Masch is the same. Masch went to Barca because they need a certain type of player, not because he sets the world on fire. And your boy Alonso had been so out of favor that Rafa was trying to sell him before our best season. 


If you're going to argue Hendo isn't up to the CMs in the PL right now at Chelsea, City, Utd, Arsenal, etc, than that's an argument where you might even be coming from somewhere based on pure world class spectrum. But if you're basing it off our own past?? Hendo is probably better or as good as everyone but Gerrard. In terms of what he offers a club, he offers more than most of those other guys.

The reason you think they're better is through the lens of history. Experience the moment man and realize you're enjoying something special. Hendo is a rare player, no matter what you think.

The whole point of agile is that you *can't* validate a piece of software until it lives in the real world. There are just too many variables, too many blind spots, too many factors that cannot be foreseen. And because software is uniquely malleable, and uniquely vulnerable to these kind of validation errors, it makes sense to release, changes, iterate and repeat.

Really, changing a design shouldn't be difficult if you build for that possibility. The application that serves the news stories can be a separate service to the one that renders the HTML. That web service can use a strandalone grid framework for layout CSS with separate helper classes for common visual effects. New designs can be composed fairly quickly and - if code is written with automated testing as a first-class concern - changes can be built and deployed without even having to go through manual QA testing.

Of course, this is the ideal, and most companies don't achieve it perfectly, but larger organisations with the right resources and the right staff should be able to deliver it.

The number of 'predators' ensures that the fox cannot escape and it can only run to it's inevitable death. That makes it inhumane.

On the other hand, one man with a lurcher gives the animal hope. It means that even if it is effectively running to it's death, the fact that it is pursued by only one predator means it always has hope of escaping to a safe haven. In that respect, it is humane. Of course, less 'predators' comes at the cost of effectiveness, but that is the nature of a 'predator v prey' chase.

When I was an Officer Cadet in the RAF the government had laid off a load of pilots who were about to complete their training. This meant that there was not enough pilots to fly the new Airbus ""Voyager"" tanker aircraft, when they started coming into service, so many of them were flown by civilian contractors who earned at least twice as much. Another common thing was the contracting of civilian freighters to fly cargo to afghanistan because we didn't have enough transport aircraft.

The main saving in these cases is on things like pensions in the long term.

The data is even more revealing, however, when you break it down even further. Whilst each new generation generally becomes less socially and religiously conservative than their parents, the reverse is happening in the British-Pakistani community.

Here is an Economist article comparing the Bangledeshi and Pakistani communities: 

http://www.economist.com/news/britain/21644155-britain-bangladeshis-have-overtaken-pakistanis-credit-poor-job-market-when-they-arrived

This government document would suggest that young British-Pakistanis are falling back on their Muslim identity when confronted with their diminishing connections to Pakistan. Particularly language.

*'The identity of different generations varies, with the elders from the first generation still feeling a strong connection towards their country of birth. The second generation also has a deep connection to Pakistan, but to a much lesser extent than their parents. The third generation of young people see themselves as primarily British and this forms a strong part of their identity. As the country of birth of their parents and grandparents, they still have a deep personal or psychological association with Pakistan, but one that is a substantially diminished part of their own personal identity in comparison to their parents. However, the majority of community members of all ages and generations unequivocally describe themselves as British Muslims.'* 

http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120919132719/http:/www.communities.gov.uk/documents/communities/pdf/1170952.pdf


'*The identity factor, which explains that a language may be vital to the maintenance of some community’s identity, was already touched upon when refering to the immigrant community’s core values.'*

All the other teams get it also, and most of them get a lot more sponsorship money than us too. The TV deal doesn't help us one bit, if anything it hurts us because we are going to drop more points to the bottom teams, who the top 4 sides will have more individual brilliance to beat with a moment of magic when they park the bus.

I was constantly getting skincare stuff and stuff I didn't want (like brown eyeliners and red blush). Some of the stuff was really not great but I think there's two things I still use after 4 months of subscription; a lipbalm, a razor. I definitely didn't get anything that I thought I would have bothered purchasing in a store. Not worth £40.

Honestly most of the products went to my little sister or in the bin. It's all drugstore stuff in bad colours and you'd be better off shopping in TK Maxx, because it's the same unwanted crap and at least then you get to actually pick and choose. I wasn't impressed paying £10 plus shipping for little Tresame conditioners and lotion samples. 


I cancelled it soon because I didn't feel it was worth it, but tbh my main issue was that their customer service was beyond shit. I emailed asking what date the packages went out on and got a response saying 'Here's a link to our FAQ on how to track your package!' so I replied saying I'd not received a tracking number or dispatch email and that's why I'd contacted them, and I was ignored for about a week, then I got the dispatch email. Within an hour I got another email saying (rudely) 'we checked and you did get a dispatch email, check again'. Yeah by now I've gotten it but a week ago when I contacted you I hadn't. 

I then emailed a couple of months later asking about customisation, asking could they not send me skincare as I have a skin condition they told me they do not tailor the boxes and everyone gets the same stuff unless they start running out of products. Which pissed me off because they act like they tailor it individually...

Then I had a bottle break in transit (not their fault) and after several emails back and forth (each of which took days for them to reply to) with them demanding more pictures, they eventually agreed to send me replacements for the damaged stuff. Except they didn't, they sent me multiples of the same product (which wasn't in the original box). Seriously. I got like 3 identical Collection bronzers. Same shade and everything. That peed me off so I cancelled and then they insisted on charging me for another month because I ""hadn't cancelled on time"" which normally I'd be fine with but I only hadn't cancelled on time because it took them so long to replay to my emails... When I told them no, I didn't want the last box, they quite rudely said 'we're sending it anyway and charging you. If you don't want it you can send it back at your own expense.'

Promising and signing explicit pledges to not do something and then doing that something enthusiastically at the first opportunity is not ""a poor job of managing expectations"".

The Lib Dems would come across better if they understood what a monumental fuck-up the tuition fees thing was. A large part of their support base was students, who they pledged to protect; they then failed to stand up for that support base. Another large part was social democrats; they then sapped the goodwill that support base as the parliamentary party tethered themselves to a hard right party that was completely against anything they actually voted in favour of. The LDs did temper the Tories but it's not inconsistent to say that they both did that and also fucked their support base over and abused their goodwill to put in power a government very few of them support. Add to this that Nick Clegg presented himself as something different, an alternative, and then proceeded to do all of the above, and you can probably see why the LDs are reviled now.

If anything, your whole critique on Henderson is irrelevant, because its false and very reactionary, which falls in line with this sub - extremely reactionary. Its an opinion which is rubbish. We are literally two wins or six points away from being a top four team...its not a million miles away which you are implying. By your logic, last season Wayne Rooney, isn't a top four player because his team wasn't performing at a top four level. Take for instance James Milner at City, he has a similar playing style to Henderson, the pressing game, hard working player - yet he's been in title winning teams with City - I would say Hendo is on par at least, if not the better player.

Your post reeks of looking for a scapegoat, bias or not, anyone can see Henderson is improving and has improved a hell of a lot this season without a top striker in front of him which would make him even better. Look at his stats, fourteen assists and seven goals.

My view might well be in line with a large section of the sub, because guess what? We're right. We can see that Henderson isn't as poor as you make out and isn't the scapegoat you're looking for. If you're not looking for a scapegoat you aren't masking it very well with a thread like this. 

Forget playing the minority/hesitancy card thats a none issue, say what you like on the sub, its cool, I do it, so do others - but just expect to be pulled up on it.

The whole team has suffered because of the lack of a top striker, but to single out Henderson who has probably been one of the better players I just don't get.

&gt;But then I guess he would have been accused of giving a politicians answer (read: not giving a people a nice and tidy yes or no, because anything more complicated is confusing).

But he didn't. If that's what you think then why *didn't* he just give the politician's answer of ""I could live on a standard and non-exploited ZHC""? instead he made himself look worse by repeatedly refusing to answer the question and finishing with 'but thats not really the question here'.

According to your link

&gt;Just over half of the **456** workers questioned did not want more hours.

There are 1-2,000,000 people working zero hour contracts, do you really think 500 from a single company is a fair survey?

Zero hour contracts appeal to people who don't *need* to work. In my student town, over half the ZHC's are taken up by university students who just need a little side money. They are of course going to be happy with minimal work, while all the adults wanting to work will both be in the minority on 'wanting more hours' and significantly suffering because they aren't earning enough.


&gt;40% of workers subject to the contracts said they had shifts cancelled without notice

is one of the primary problems

As is

&gt;38% of those on zero-hours contracts wanted more hours

No one in a job should have to *want* more hours. 60% are happy with their hours, that's great, but **40%** are under-employed to the point they need and want to work more. That is a massive figure given ZHC are for these people their sole form of income.

**In:** **New backup GK** - someone good enough to challenge Mignolet, and ideally someone with better distribution / sweeping ability. **New first-choice RB** - preferably someone with good end product, since none of our so-called 'attacking' fullbacks offer that often enough. **James Milner** - will instantly fit into our pressing system, can play many midfield positions which will help Rodgers greatly, offers lots of experience and professionalism on and off the pitch which we'll need for a post-Gerrard Liverpool, and good at set pieces too. **New quality striker** - Irrespective of whether we land Ings, you'd hope we're still on for a more proven striker as well. The requirements remain the same as last summer - pacey striker that makes runs off the last defender to get on the end of through balls, and will help us press off the ball. 

Those are the minimum requirements.

Three inhumane fox deaths where discounted as they where atypical however it would not surprise me if there where many more. 
The assumption that animals do not understand death I personally don't believe to be correct as there is evidence of animals morening death and loss. Animals protecting injured. So to me they understand the preservation of life.
 The report indicated they felt nearly no pain however sited a study on humans with certain injuries and this was not 100% unanimous with 30% referencing pain.

It also indicated dog bites can be near instantaneous if the dog is trained correctly. Implying all dogs will be.

If you want to reduce emissions, invest in sensible and sustainable alternatives rather than pumping money into the source of the problem.

The prospect of a Liberal recovery depends largely on how utterly leashed to the Tory right this government ends up being. Five years of being able to credibly say ""We would have stopped this, and here's where we did so five years ago"" would help things considerably. 

The core point, ""What are the Liberal Democrats for?"" however, is fair- the necessity of fighting *every* campaign as a tactical one is a consequence of the electoral system, but it does leave the question very much open. Fighting campaign after campaign dominated by playing up to transient local NIMBYism and national-level political opportunism doesn't provide us with a bedrock to point to when push comes to shove. 

Glibly shoehorning ""Stronger Economy, Fairer Society, Opportunity for All"" into every sentence party figures come out with says nothing about us whatsoever. We need to focus on our core values more- civil liberties, human rights, the welfare state as an facilitator of individual freedom, internationalism, an ethical foreign policy, and environmental activism.

null,false,Chlorophilia,null,null,null,"This is one of the standard greenwash excuses that energy companies have been using for decades. The environmental problems that we are facing are very serious and they are imminent. We need to be investing as much as possible in genuine, sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels because a transition to a low-carbon energy system will not be possible quickly enough otherwise. All of this investment into reducing the emissions of fossil fuel power plants is just diverting money away from sustainable investments that are genuinely needed. Why on earth would you invest millions into a technology that we know we have to get rid of as soon as possible when we could be investing that money into technologies that we know we need? You even admit that yourself - you state that these power plants have ""another twenty years of life expectancy"" (which is probably an understatement if anything) so why invest millions into a technology with a twenty year life expectancy when we could be investing in technologies that could last forever?

If we lived in a perfect world where funding was unlimited then sure, we could give money to industry to reduce the footprint of their plants whilst we transition to renewables. But funding situation is actually very dire and contrary to the fossil fuels industry, research into renewables needs all the funding it can get. It doesn't have a powerful global industry to back it up, it relies largely on public funding. The fossil fuels industry has *more* than enough money to finance these initiatives to lower their own emissions themselves. But obviously, since governments are too scared (or too invested in those industries) to impose serious regulations, they're not going to. 

*Everyone* knows this, the only reason why this money is going to these corporations and towards ""clean coal"" initiatives is because of industry lobbying. A switch to renewable energy is literally an existential risk to the fossil fuels industry and given that they're the wealthiest industry on the planet, it's no surprise that they're fighting tooth and nail to hold on to their power.",null,0,null,1431864538,null,0,1431864954,0,crbuype,null,t3_368xcq,null,t1_crbuype,null,t1_crbumoy,null,null,null,1433110721,null,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8,null

I have come to the conclusion that he (sterling) is an average dude playing for a big club.
He does offer speed and nothing more than that.
While you can swear, call me a racist, or whatever else you wish to, I will not have any issues with it.
There is nothing about him to say that he has something inside him to be the greatest ever.

If I may use an example.
Please look up Colin Isles. Dude is fast, one of the fastest ever.
He started and was crap.
He is still crap when we compare with him with the skills and mindset required to play the game.
You can look at the highlights all you want of him and yes he does score but he offers nothing to the team and in the long run this has cost the team.

It is amazing to see how fast Sterling is but there has been nothing to show he will be lethal.
You claim to have been following him for so long and I have not but have you actually got your head out of your arse and seen how many chances he wastes and how easily he goes down?

Now I am starting to wonder who out of the two of us is actually looking at this through a bias.
Is it me?
Or is it you, since you have invested so much time into following him?

Whatever it may be, I am calling it as I see things and he just isn't good enough.
His image is due to the fact that he is now British.
Similarly how Wallcot bursts out with his speed and was said that he will be he greatest.
Nothing happened with him.
All he offered was speed. Sometimes it worked and many times it did not.
The team needs consistency. 
Oh might I add that it is a great thing to be kind to people.
You never know what they are going through in their lives and how they are when frequenting this website.
It doesn't hurt anyone to be kind.

You'd also need copies of any agreements between them and the club (particularly anything setting out that they're selfemployed) and the exact terms on which said selfemployment would be done - including possibly your friend testing the boundaries of that selfemployment by (eg) sending someone else to do their shift, and seeing if they're turned away or allowed to work the shift in your friend's place. 

Basically, keep accurate diaries and records of absolutely everything possible, and then consult the CAB or a union (join a union, one of the umbrella ones like Unite is the default since they cover every sector)

I'm not gonna lie: it probably won't be worth the effort for them personally - the process to resolve things will be extremely long and arduous and involve quite a lot of financial risk for things like tribunal fees, and there's no guarantee of success - and even with a win, the likely outcome is coming out nominally only a little bit better off, and in real terms having spent a lot of time and effort on making a case.

A lot of people think the violent protests in the cause of women's suffrage were justified. Some people think the protests against the poll tax were justified. A few people think the countryside alliance's violent demonstration in favour of fox hunting with dogs was justified. 

Nevertheless protest is a valid part of democracy. And while I don't hold with actual violence, I'm totally on board with carefully considered civil disobedience. 

What the successful protests I mentioned had in common was that the actual protests were a small part of the picture. There was a strong campaign for womens' suffrage, and a lot of people were convinced that it was fair and reasonable. The poll tax was discredited by the fact that a lot of people couldn't or wouldn't pay, and by the spectacle of old ladies going to jail. 

I see protests without that sort of grassroots campaign as kind of lazy. But that doesn't mean that there won't be a time and place for protests. 

Re the EU: two weeks ago I would have agreed with you. But I got the election results so wrong (along with the polls and the bookies) that I'm not as confident in my ability to predict these things. So I'm considering my options.

First of all there's the whole New Labour and the Third Way which, while claiming to find a way between the two ways of Socialism and Capitalism was really only about the marketisation and privatisation of previous state-controlled services.

These started as Private Finance Initiatives under the Tories and then became Public-Private Partnerships under Labour which expanded them. These guaranteed private companies, and their share holders, their profits whilst saddling the public service with a ton of debt.

Other examples, also from the Blair years, are the introduction and then increase of tuition fees, the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, the Invasion of Afghanistan and the Invasion and Occupation of Iraq.

Under Brown there was the continuing occupation of Iraq and also his bailing out the banks after the financial crisis and more recently there was the alliance between Labour and the Tories to do in electoral reform and their alliance against Scottish Independence.

My issue with the protests after the election are they were pretty much protesting the result.

My issue with protests in general is that they're done so often and by the same people that if you or I wanted to protest we'd be ignored as just the usual background noise. That's because there's now plenty of people who protest as a hobby - in the same way other people would go to a football match.

I don't know the answer to that one. Removing their right to protest because they've continually abused it doesn't seem fair to me, and it opens a rather unsettling and creepy door where the state can conspire to silence people.

It's now the point that unless a protest is violent it won't get news coverage.

You can do more harm than good randomly adding pills and potions because this messes with the delicate balance. I strongly recommend you adhere to all the healthy eating guidelines, they work together to keep you healthy (skin and all). If you eat too little of one food group it means you are eating too much of another.

If for any reason you need to supplement (food allergies, pregnancy), that would need to be discussed with a registered dietician or other appropriately qualified health professional. For safety they need to know things like your medical history, diet, activity levels, medication etc.

I sat in on an unfair dismissal hearing once where an employee had been fired because she had irritable bowel syndrome and went to the toilet more than the average person. The employer successfully argued that the 10 minutes she spent away from her till meant he had to take someone from the sales floor to cover her, which in turn cost him money. He also claimed that as her toilet breaks were unpredictable, there were no reasonable measures to be put in place.

The employer could dismiss her claiming that there are no reasonable alterations he could make to the employees working environment that would help the situation. He could also claim that having a member of staff bleeding unpredictably could negatively affect his business. her refusal to seek a remedy to the issue would also be a contributing factor. 

Imagine if a shop worker had a gash on their arm, which in reality required stitched, but because of the persons fear of needles, they refused to get stitched. If on odd occasions, that wound began to bleed through the dressing and required the employee to leave their work station to tend to it, would you seriously suggest that the employer wouldn't have reasonable grounds to dismiss said employee?

""I want to talk about my experience of that momentous today yesterday. I had a few tickets and decided for this game I’d sit in the Lower Centenary, despite making a pact with myself a couple of years ago that I’d never sit anywhere other than the Kop ever again. It was row 4 and as the game was meaningless I thought I’d get close to the pitch.

I left my lads tournament early to get the train over with a group of mates. We just stayed in the pubs around James St. Anyway, I had to meet someone at the ground early to sort some tickets out and thought I’m not paying nearly a tenner for a taxi on my own. I approached some taxi’s at the lights that had people in I could tell were going to the match. So I knocked on a few windows and said ‘can I jump in to the ground’. Sorry mate I’m picking others up. No, can’t mate. Turns the other way to avoid answering. 4 turned me down. Just think about that. Liverpool fans can’t let another fan share a cab. It’s fuckin despicable imo. I wouldn’t even contemplate saying no. Why would I? *Sidenote. A couple of months ago we got off at Lime St and grabbed a cab at the back of the station. Can you take us to the ground mate? Yeah, it’s £30. Fuck off mate it’s £7. Take it or leave it. Was out of my hands as my mates said fuck it, let’s just get in. On the way we were bullying the driver and he said ‘oh, you’re all season ticket holders – I’ll do it for £15. It didn’t feel like a victory.

So, I got to the ground by bus and was shocked to see my ticket was turnstile J. I’d assumed it was the scoreboard end of the LC. As it was I was near the corner flag at the opposite end. I’ve never seen anything like it. Robbo and Mickey Malibu have wrote about the crowd and if I’m honest, I thought it was exaggerated. Their writing didn’t reflect what I see in the Kop. Well, yesterday it more than did. These seats must be the Thomas Cook ones people mention. I had at least 50 people from South East Asia around me (P.s I love these fans, love their passion and I love the way they see the club and not bothered where anyone is from), my point is only that it was clearly a transient crowd. I looked around at the make up of the crowd and I found it fairly disturbing. I saw the bags of merchandise in front of me and could see why the club would want these transient sections. They’d spent 100′s. I couldn’t even see the match for zoom lenses from the professional cameras everyone seemed to have. The lad next to me didn’t stop texting throughout to the point I was intrigued and spent 10 mins trying to read it over his shoulder. It was unrelated to football. I kind of thought half and half scarves didn’t really exist except for a few kids marking their first game. There was friggin thousands of them. Singing? I’d planned to go and give Stevie a send off. I got plenty tanked up enough to really go for it but within minutes I knew I wouldn’t open my mouth all game. I like to chant aggressively. This had a feel of a choir singing all things bright and beautiful. Substitute the words for Steve Gerrard, Gerrard, He’ll pass the ball 40 yards… You can’t sing it like that with such pleasantry. It doesn’t work.

Planes, abuse from the crowd at a few points after the game, I wondered what I was doing there. I looked around and thought, I share nothing in common with these people. I don’t wanna be among them. I don’t enjoy being among them. I wish I was at home. I then got a text to say my lads team had won the tournament and it compounded how much I was hating being there. Really wish I’d not bothered. We’d planned to meet up in Liverpool centre for a few drinks after the match but walking down Everton Valley I got a call to say we’re gonna head straight back. Luckily I saw someone from Chester and jumped in the car with them. I think my mates thought – end of season, celebrate Stevie etc but the reality is Anfield is so boring your energy levels drop to an extent going home seems the best thing.

I woke up this morning and went on Twitter to capture some of the magic of yesterday that I felt I missed out on. Ha, as fuckin if. All I saw was bile. And these were the Liverpool fans. You know, sometimes I’m not bothered that Ian Ayre was there. I’m not interested that FSG weren’t there. I can’t be arsed with looking for conspiracy theories everywhere. I can’t be arsed waking up to Joseph Cousins tweets about games that happened 8 months ago so he could have a dig at Rodgers under the guise of respectability. I can’t be arsed seeing the same agenda’s from people day after day. The truth is, I hate Liverpool fans. They can’t even let someone share a cab with them. They make Anfield an unpleasant place. They make my Sunday mornings turn sour with their bullshit. If Sterling was undecided about his future they’ve made his mind up. Yesterday was a nothing game. It was all about Steven Gerrard. I feel like the whole things just passed me by and is somewhere buried among the hatred and agenda’s. I respect a few on Twitter, like Malibu’s view this morning, but I feel like I need a straightener with half of them or I can’t move on. I won’t be going to Anfield again. I don’t enjoy it.""",null,0,null,1431869432,null,0,false,0,crbwcqn,null,t3_369dki,null,t1_crbwcqn,null,t3_369dki,null,null,null,1433111449,null,7,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,7,null

Each paragraph is extremely long though. I'm wondering if its even worth doing an introduction and conclusion?  
  
This is an example paragraph:  
Steinbeck presents the idea of the American Dream as unlikely, even from chapter one of the novel;   
“You gonna be sick like you was last night”.  
The repetition of “you” highlights George’s focus and concentration on his friendship with Lennie. He is constantly monitoring, supervising and guiding Lennie. Whilst this is positive in terms of their friendship, attaining the American Dream seemed to require an extreme independence and lack of reliance or collusion with others, unless for financial gain. For example the Boss, the most prosperous character in the novel, is not linked with anyone else; wife, friend or business partner, which may be why he’s so successful.  
“sick” sounds unpleasant and highlights the impoverished and unpleasant living conditions of ranch workers such as George and Lennie; men in an unstable physical condition were also unlikely to be able to attain a ‘dream’ or success and prosperity.   
Furthermore, “last night” infers that this cyclical nature of Lennie making mistakes and hindering both men’s ability to make progress is only going to be repeated; Lennie doesn’t learn from his mistakes and we can confidently predict that he is likely to make more as the novel goes on (George has already suggested a hiding place in such a situation) and prevent the realisation of the American   Dream.  
Steinbeck’s intention is to demonstrate the hardships of workers such as these two men who represent the common, disadvantaged labouring man of the 1930s and perhaps glean sympathy for their desperate attempt to achieve and succeed in a world fraught with obstacles.

Some examples :-

In the US

You are no longer able to protest near where a Secret Service agent is expected to operate.
So the authorities merely need to create an excuse for a Secret  Service agent to operate in the vicinity of a planned demonstration in order to be able to cancel it.

In the UK

Laws have been passed that make it easier for the authorities to ban any demonstrations they wish to. They merely have to state that such demonstration might cause some inconvenience or disturbance to the local neighborhood.
It is very unlikely that a reasonably well attended protest would not cause any inconvenience to local residents.
Protesters tend to chant slogans and have speeches with public address systems.

In Canada

You are no longer allowed to wear a mask at a demonstration.
The purpose of this law is so that the authorities can identify you, in order to carry out possible later harassment and intimidation.

In Japan

Secrecy laws have now been forced through which allows the government to make any topic, e.g. Fukushima, a State Secret with heavy penalties for divulging information.
You are not allowed to know what the government considers a State Secret until the government accuses someone of breaking it. http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/11/fukushima-radiation-will-hit-fish-west-coast-north-america.html

In Spain

New laws have just been passed with heavy fines for ""unauthorised"" street protests
The recent Spanish protests against their current extreme economic deprivation have been notable for the peacefulness of the demonstrators (if not of the Police). http://libertyblitzkrieg.com/2013/12/02/war-on-democracy-spain-and-japan-move-to-criminalize-protests/

In the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand

The authorities are now collecting just about every piece of electronic communication and phone call on every citizen, via the Five Eyes program and the sharing of Mass Surveillance information.

The purpose of this is the possible future harassment and intimidation of political activists plus domestic political control of important domestic figures. http://ian56.blogspot.com/2013/11/as-keith-alexander-has-already-admitted.html

The REAL purpose of NSA Mass Surveillance is to undermine democracy in America &amp; the West to promote the interests of large crony Corporations http://ian56.blogspot.com/2013/09/the-primary-purpose-of-nsas-mass.html

In the US Laws and measures have recently been passed to :-

Remove the right to a speedy and fair trial if accused of a crime

Completely remove the right to privacy (from government surveillance)

Remove the right of public protest without fear of harassment or intimidation or physical violence by the authorities

Remove the rights of a journalist to write a highly critical piece on the government, without fear of arrest or other intimidation by the government (the UK has already done this)

Allow the Federal government to unilaterally declare Martial Law even if the local Governor or the Mayor disagrees.

Militarize the Police and DHS with ex-army equipment, including armored heavy trucks and armored cars.
Soften up the public to expect abuses by the authorities via the TSA, more frequent police abuses, dry runs of Martial Law, arming of IRS agents etc.

Develop facial recognition software to automatically link a face in a crowd to an id and the surveillance dossier held on every citizen. To be used on surveillance drones and ""security"" cameras.

Allow surveillance drones to fly in every inch of American airspace via over 50 authorized American military airbases. http://ian56.blogspot.com/2012/11/obamas-civil-rights-violations.html

Allow limitless political funding by Corporations via SuperPacs and Citizens United.
This takes away the individuals rights to free, fair and unrigged elections.
The outcome of elections in America is now almost exclusively decided by Corporate election funding and by the Corporate controlled and owned mass media.
Individuals hardly ever even get to vote for a candidate that is not completely owned by Corporate interests. Candidates that are not owned by Corporate funding rarely get the publicity required in order to be able to mount a serious campaign.

The TPP and Tafta ""trade"" agreements (in progress) which subjugate National Sovereignty and individual rights in favor of the rights of multinational Corporations.

“One of the most egregious sections of law I’ve encountered during my time as a representative: It grants the executive branch virtually unlimited access to the communications of every American.”
""The intelligence reauthorization bill, which the House will vote on today, contains a troubling new provision that for the first time statutorily authorizes spying on U.S. citizens without legal process.""

&gt;

&gt;In __association football__, some national and club sides include one or more __[stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_(polygon\))__ as part of (or beside) the __[badge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badge)__ (often referred to as a ""[crest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crest_(sports\))"") appearing on their shirt, to represent important trophies the team has previously won. Often this is a unilateral decision by a team itself, rather than a specific privilege earned or sanctioned by any governing body and as such, the relevance of these stars on a club's shirt is somewhat tenuous.

null,false,myheroinepretend,null,null,null,"It sounds like we have similar skin types, though mine is more prone to CCs than blackheads. The three game changers for me were:

AHAs - SO MUCH. I use alpha hydrox's 10% glycolic every day and their 14% swipes weekly. My skin seems to have quite a low turnover when shedding dead skin cells (hence the dryness) and these help speed that along. They're both a bit pricey and available on Amazon but there are cheaper AHAs out there (see the mega threads in the side bar for recs) 

BHAs: I wanted to love stridex because of how cheap it was,  but alas, the menthol did more harm than good. Found another budget alternative by sr-skincare and oh my god, it changed everything. I've posted a review on their 5% salicylic acid before so I won't repeat myself but yeah, immediately noticeable results, for me at least. 

Benzoyl peroxide - yes it is really drying but when used as a spot treatment occasionally it made a huge difference. Those horrible cystic type spots healed considerably faster. I found obtaining a prescription was really easy once I explained to my doctor I'd been using salicylic acid for a while but to no avail. 

Other things that might help: I love my konjac sponge. Gives you that nice exfoliating feeling without scrubbing. Superdrug sell one fo £2/3. Hydrocolloid bandages help increase the rate of healing for spots too, and I have found they help bring certain spots to a head, I don't know about blackheads. You can often pick some up in poundland - coldsore patches and blister plasters are usually hydrocolloid. They essentially act as a scab so your body doesn't have to go to the hassle of creating one itself and can go straight to the healing. At least that's how I've always understood it. 

Last but certainly not least - don't introduce a load of new products at once. I know it goes without saying but that wasn't enough for me apparently and my skin flared up so badly. Of course all these recommendations are just what helped me and what I wish I'd learned faster, but everyone's skin is different and there seem to be some other great recs here too. 

Good luck! I know how insecure skin can make you feel but I promise you it's nowhere near as noticeable to others as it is to you.

If you compare to the previous election the Conservatives won 10.7M, Labour 8.6M, LD 6.8M. 

This time around Conservatives got 11.3M, Lab 9.3M, LD 2.4, SNP 1.4 and UKIP 3.8M.

So Labours support didn't diminish, but if voters left to UKIP, then Lab was buttressed by the 4.2M voters fleeing LD. 

Looking at South Thanet - Labour used to have 14K votes, but now got 11K, so not a huge change, despite UKIP going from 2K to 16K votes. However, the LDs went from just under 7K to just under 1K. So there is a lot of movement around. UKIP may be 4K votes from Cons, 5K extra voters - does that mean 5K votes from Labour and Lib Dems? Or 5K from Labour and 2K Lib Dem vote transfering to Labour?

The real question, in relation to this is, however, that if they are moving to UKIP, and if UKIP were to give them a [How to vote card](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How-to-vote_card) would they follow it?

It says more about you than anyone here that your first thought when defending Lenny Henry was to bring up the fact that he's black.

Fuck off and write a blog about it, there you can mindlessly accuse people of racism in one breathe whilst judging an entire race negatively in the next with no criticism from those pesky Lenny-Henry-hating honkies.

Edit. Sir-Clenchalot attempted some character assassination that has strangely disappeared, accusations of Islamphobia and racism, something about Jeremy Clarkson too, it was a struggle to get through it all with tears of joy welling up in my eyes.

Link away, you beast, feel free to spend as much time and attention on me as you like.

&gt;One look through your comment history proves that you are a staunch conservative supporter (for the past 16 years) and in general a very unpleasant piece of shit with no humanity and an islamophobic, racist. All of which you will most likely deny but I am happy to link to these comments you have made.

&gt;So thanks for proving my point that Henry haters are all right wingers! 


&gt;I'm sorry but I am sick and tired of seeing Lenny Henry attacked by the usual racist idiots such as UKIP and Jeremy Clarkson, so I can only presume that any attack on Lenny Henry, especially when on a site and subreddit like this, is race motivated. You've made two comments in this thread all of them in defence of Lenny Henry critics, why would anyone who is indifferent to the man be worked into such a fervour? Most unfunny white comedians do not receive the same kind of malicious attacks by media and internet bigots.

The workings of a sane mind.

Basically if one landlord has 10 or 20 properties and they're all housing benefit he'd be getting one lump sum ( which the benefits office don't like ) from the benefits office for those flats if he was paid directly. If one single tenants benefits are stopped and the tenant doesn't tell the landlord it can become difficult for the landlord to find out which tenant it is and they then have to go to the housing benefit to get the information. This then creates a lot more work for the housing benefit office.

If however the tenant pays the landlord directly the landlord knows straight away who the non payer is and they go to said non payer instead of the benefits office. The responsibility is on the receiver of benefits and not the housing benefits office.

Now that even they have decided they can't keep spending money on him, and the channels that are trying to make a profit certainly won't be hiring him, he's resorted to doing adverts.

We don't live in the 1900s anymore we are in the 21st century, people of all skin colours and religions live together in relative harmony. Sure there are some groups like 'Britain First' and the 'EDL' who want to make sure that it doesn't stay that way but they are a minority.

Black people, Asian people and white people all have same opportunities if they live in the UK or anywhere else in the ~~Empire~~ Civilised world. I'd argue that its people like you who keep argueing that white people are privalaged are the ones who are holding us back.

Sure! There may be more rich white people than black people but that could be because of many factors  
1.Family Inheritance (white people were very much wealthy in the past)  
2.Coincidence (Because thats what it is)

now stop thinking the world is racist we are a society that sometimes gets things wrong sure but we are changing, things like Gay Marriage and the like are becoming acceptable 

using Colonial history as a way to describe white people being privileged is a stupid arguement because look at countries like the USA it never had an empire but blacks and whites still have the same rights ~~ignore the south~~

I'd like you to show me where Black people are being punished for not being white, sure some people may be attacked by again another Minority group but that isn't proof that there is a system out to get them.

I'd also suggest going on the North York Moors Railway which is a steam railway that has regular departures to Goathland and Whitby. 

I'd also suggest Whitby as it's also a good shout for a visiting tourist. It's a very quaint harbour town that has some very good tourist shops for trinkets i.e. ammonites, amber, whale bones.

It's usually 4 to 5 lines in the Introduction, and then a conclusion of the same length as the other paragraphs. The conclusion should include some sort of final point, like analysing another line, which sums up your general message.

In the second part (I do Of Mice and Men), don't bother with an introduction in the textual analysis section. You don't need one, and it wastes time. Just launch right in and get words on the page.
With part B, the question about the text as a whole, I would recommend an introduction and a conclusion. Short introduction, and medium length conclusion, again with some sort of final point.

Here's some resources I have. They're for Of Mice and Men and the Crucible (as well as Character and voice poetry), but they should still be useful as an example of what I mean...

They counted the local &amp; parlimentart into bundles of 50 by type of ballot &amp; checked the numbers matched the registers.

After this they put the locals to one side and started counting the parlimentary votes into bundles of 50 by party.

They then announced the results, there was only one recount I remember for Balls (we all knew he'd lost he's pretty hated in the constituency) which took a lifetime. 

After this the next day at 2pm they did the count.for the locals.

How a whole box could go missing seems impossible if Kent counted like this.

My point is that when we played Barcalona in 2012 we were going through on away goals but that Torres goal sealed the game and prevented any chance of a comeback. Barca **may** have scored if we hadnt of scored that last goal and forced ET.

At Stamford Bridge during ET against PSG we were 2-1 up, and we were going through until that T.Silva goal. **Imagine** if someone had scored a goal then and we went 3-1 up, it would have sealed the game but it'd be similar to the Barca story of:

 [**Door-in-the-face technique**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Door-in-the-face%20technique): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;The __door-in-the-face__ (__DITF__) __technique__ is a [compliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compliance_(psychology\)) method commonly studied in [social psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_psychology).   The persuader attempts to convince the respondent to comply by making a large request that the respondent will most likely turn down, much like a metaphorical slamming of a door in the persuader's face. The respondent is then more likely to agree to a second, more reasonable request, compared to the same reasonable request made in isolation.   The DITF technique can be contrasted with the [foot-in-the-door (FITD) technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot-in-the-door_technique), in which a persuader begins with a small request and gradually increases the demands of each request.   While the FITD technique differs from DITF, it is also a persuasion technique that increases the likelihood a respondent will agree to the second request.

You just sound like you don't know how to communicate with people.

Then, when he didn't stand up in parliament and talk for 10 minutes straight about surveillance, circus animals and the employment prospects of young people, you declare him a cock and start sending abusive letter to him.

If you start late and have had no other employment this tax year, then your employer might be able to pull some strings with your tax code, but you would need to talk to their payroll department about that. 

Basic rate income tax is 20% - so if you earned £1,000 gross per month you would be taxed on £167 *0.2 (ie £33).

In addition to income tax, you will suffer Class 1 Primary national insurance contributions. This is, at basic rate, 12% of your earnings above £8,060 per year, or £671 per month. 

Again, if you were paid £1,000 gross per month you would suffer NICs on £329 * 0.12 (£39). 

Put to the two together, and if you were paid £1,000 a month you would take home £928. If you contribute into a pension scheme, this would be slightly different, but I assume this will not be am issue for a placement!

If their methods are chemical, it implies the use of some strong acids.  If they're kinetic, chipping away rock seems possible.  Either way, it might be possible for the Vashta Nerada to seriously harm Angels.

Managers demanding a third screen and then only using it as a post it note board. Constant rearrangements of entire offices entailing a lot of extra man hours and weekend pay to no real benefit. Our office has had two major moves within the same office space in the past year. 

In regards to pay I can't complain. Its not great pay but more than I'd get in the private sector. I got a bonus at christmas, a pay rise of 2% and i get my incremental pay rise in June. This is the first time ive worked in the public sector and im genuinely shocked at how hard done by some of my colleagues feel. None of them realise how lucky and protected they are in their jobs. By and large these people have spent the majority of their working lives in local government and dont realise how tough things are out there for non public sector workers. One lady spends most of the day watching judge judy at her desk, one guy has been *banned* from visiting another office as he spends so much time chatting that reduces the work done by colleagues in this separate office. This didnt lead a disciplinary though. People like this are a small but significant minority in our very large office. This behaviour just wouldn't be tolerated in the private sector but these people have got away with it year after year.

I understand this post wont chime well with a large number of people and i do agree that austerity is going too far now but local councils (mine anyway) could stand to improve is hiring and procurement practises and save a lot of money that could go to better providing for the local community.

The difference between those two is like believing in a nationalist cause and believing that you need to wade in blood to get it. I gave up trying to explain to non-Muslims a long time ago since most don't want to hear. So if that is what you think of me, keep thinking that.

However this article says he wanted to join them. I don't know why as a foreigner he wanted to do that. However up until 2009, Al-Shabab wasn't considered a terrorist group by most Somalias.

They fought against the Ethiopian occupations, clan militias and warlords. They saved people who were victimised because of tribal/ethnic/linguistic reasons. They were obviously called a terrorist group by the US because the Ethiopian occupation was Bush's idea.

However they wents suddenly. First by doing suicide bombings. Then trying to join Al-Qaeda. The beheadings, the sectarianism and then the massacre. Yeah after a while they became no different than your average Al-Qaeda terrorists. Fuck them. So many people put their hopes on them to help defeat the Warlords.

I don't think he will be a horrible signing for whoever pick him up, I also don't think he will improve any of the sides he is being linked with. I reckon will be the type of player who is either on the fringes at a medium size club, or starting for a lower bottom half team for the rest of his career.

I think he has been overhyped because he has been OK for a shockingly bad side, but as with Kone that probably doesn't mean an awful lot. Up until last year Ings was considered a bit shit, and a waste of £1m by Burnley fans... Yes he has got a lot better, but he still only has a handful of good performances against Premier League teams.

I wouldn't be annoyed if we managed to pick him up, but I really don't think he will improve us as a team.

Websites have gotten a lot better. Youtube quality is far better and has more features. Facebook didn't even really have a newsfeed style feature for awhile, it was more akin to myspace visiting peoples pages. 

I think what this decade may represent is the widespread penetration, normalisation and adoption of these technologies. They're being integrated into our ordinary lives as nothing special. 

This isn't just technology, being LGBTQ seems way more a normal part of life than it did in 2000 for example. Characters of diverse orientations are everywhere in the media both in fiction and non-fiction. Especially significant is that they are not as sterotyped individuals either. Granted this happened through the 2000s but i think we are seeing it be cemented now. 

We're probably seeing the initial sparks of things like self-driving cars and the sharing economy.

If you seriously think there's any justification for islamism then you're deluded.

There are plenty of British muslims perfectly okay with secularism, and in fact many who prefer it.

Stop trying to pretend that all muslims support your backwards desire to impose your religion on an entire country.

You can never guarantee that an entire country wants to be under islamic law. It's impossible.

Remind me again, why are you living in the UK if you are an islamist?

Is it because Islam has produced a bunch of shithole countries and you'd rather come to one rated in the top 10 on all the measures of a society so that you can reap the benefits of secularism, rationalism, reason, and the enlightenment while still supporting islamism (which is the opposite of all of those things)?",null,0,null,1431881789,null,0,1431882301,0,crc1ufs,null,t3_36911f,null,t1_crc1ufs,null,t1_crc0z4i,null,null,null,1433114037,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

At 20, Mhairi Black is the youngest MP to sit in the House of Commons since a 13-year-old aristocrat took his seat in 1667.

She also became one of the stars of the general election, unseating shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander in Paisley for the SNP. This week, she made it into Time magazine and pretty much every other newspaper and magazine in the planet - while still studying for her finals at Glasgow University. Despite all that, she was able to keep a diary of her first week in Westminster for Sunday Herald readers. Here it is:

Monday

On Monday morning I must be honest and say that the only thing going through my mind was making sure I managed to check in okay and got on the correct flight. Once we arrived in London it was media overload. The interest surrounding the fifty-six of us arriving was quite incredible and very telling as to how momentous the result of this election really is. Never before has there been such attention given to newly elected MPs in general, never mind MPs from Scotland. It signals recognition by the UK-wide media that something has changed in Scottish politics and now has the potential to change British politics as a whole.

We were then taken through Portcullis house where our IT, finances and security were all to be organised. In the following hours it became clear to me that people already knew who I was. I continually had members of staff smiling at me the way your distant auntie does before she squeezes your cheek after you've not seen her in five years. It was lovely in that I was constantly saying, ""thank you very much, I really appreciate it"" to the swathes of people offering me their congratulations. I would be lying if I said I didn't feel self-conscious and with an absolute brass neck because so many people were saying, ""yes Mhairi"", ""no Mhairi"", ""How you doing Mhairi?"" and I had no idea of their names to return a decent reply. Although it was a whirlwind I kept reminding myself that the sooner we get this kind of logistical and organisational stuff out of the road, then the sooner we can get to work and start helping people.

Tuesday

Tuesday was when I really got my taste of the 'Palace of Westminster'. There are 'doormen' who are located throughout the building dressed incredibly decoratively with long black tail coat jackets, white bowties and a solid gold royal emblem that hangs from their waistcoats to show they are her majesty's guards. The thing that I have found most striking is just how lovely all the doormen (and women) are, not only in their general manner, but in the great lengths they go to in order to ensure you are okay and are where you need to be. Westminster is an absolute maze with all the nooks and crannies you could possibly imagine, so I have been lost very many times and have subsequently become very familiar with the staff!

It is fairly difficult not to at least momentarily get sucked into the grandeur of the building itself. Mosaic floors, tapestries that reach the ceiling and the odd solid gold throne dotted about throughout the array of lavishly decorated rooms. Even despite the friendliness of the staff, you cannot help but feel you are in a historic and upper class estate due to the dress code. The building itself is a fortress from which you never need leave. It has umpteen dining rooms, bars, lounges and social areas which are equipped to deal with any desire you may have. Sitting out on the Terrace in the London sunshine I began to realise how people do become sucked into the Westminster establishment. Westminster is a bubble. It is closed off from the reality which surrounds it. As I was walking about enjoying the art work and the history in the pillars which surrounded me I continually had to bring things back to reality in my own head. This is not a museum. It is a place of work. Whilst I may be enjoying the sunshine in impressive and comfortable surroundings in the heart of the world famous Palace of Westminster, there are still children going to bed hungry in Paisley. There are still people in and out of work being made to feel helpless in Johnstone as they queue up at foodbanks to avoid starving. There are still hard working families in Elderslie who are witnessing the price of food go up but their wages remaining stagnant. It is not a museum, it is a place of work - it is the place where these wrongs can be changed.

Wednesday

On Wednesday we had a series of inductions on different matters such as security and parliamentary standards, which I will not go into details about. However, lunch time was quite insightful into the attitudes of some of the existing MPs and the catering staff who work there. After getting a row off of Rita at the checkout for getting chips on a piece for my lunch (as it wasn't nutritious enough and I, ""need to look after"" myself!), I went to sit down at a table to eat. Beside me was a table of kitchen staff who were sitting on a break, from where a woman signalled to me that I wasn't to sit beside them but to go up to the back of the room. Confused, I decided to follow her instructions as I am new and she knows what she's talking about. As I began to walk up to the back it became clear what she was talking about as I saw that there was a false partition with a sign saying ""MPs only beyond this point"". The minute I clicked to the division I did a U-turn and walked straight back beside the table of caterers. As I sat down I said to the woman, ""If they want us to be snobby you'd think they would go all out snobby and get a different room instead of a half effort partition?!"" to which the whole table responded with rapturous laughter. As we began to speak more they told us of how many MPs take their position so seriously that they refuse to sit anywhere unless it is exclusively for MPs or Lords. I expressed how ridiculous I found such a position as it actually reminded me of an episode of Friends where Joey can't sit with Ross when he begins working as a tour guide in the museum because, ""blue coats don't sit with white coats"". After good banter the woman said to me, ""You're quite down to earth aren't you?"" to which I responded, ""'Normal' is the word I like to use"" to which she smiled, winked and wished me a good day.

Thursday:

Once I arrived back on Thursday morning, and despite the fact all I wanted was my bed, I had to get an early train into Glasgow to carry out my voluntary work as I knew they were due to be understaffed. The full day was quite embarrassing as all the service users I have been working with for months were all ripping in about me for wearing a suit, ""I saw you on the telly! Since when do you wear smart shirts?!"" Although they were joking, they too could only remind me of the huge task we have in front if us as MPs. They are the real, first hand examples of just how much austerity damages people's lives - and now that people have entrusted us to make their voices heard, we must do just that.

After I had finished my shift I made my way home as I had to begin filling up the mountain of paperwork required to declare any financial interests I have. Although considering my last job was in a chip shop, I think I should be fine.

It's very easy to be ""enlightened"" when your living off the money you gained by killing 30% of a nation.

&gt;Remind me again, why are you living in the UK if you are an islamist?

I'm living in the UK because I'm a British Citizen. I'm living in here because people in the past came to my home town and forced my grandfather to fight a shitty world war he didn't even care about. He was fighting for one set of oppressive imperialist against another set of oppressive imperialist. So you I kind of feel self righteous and I have no need to apologise for any of my views. Until Cameron makes thought crime illegal, i'll be doing what ever I do.


&gt;I don't need to reply here because you show yourself to be vile without any commentary needed, but I will anyways. If you seriously think there's any justification for islamism then you're deluded.

I am being vile because you have no idea. Islamism isn't like Marxism, something that was just invented in recent history. This is what Muslims have been believing and doing for more than a thousand years. It's irritating having to explain to people. When you hear Islamists you think of ISIS cutting people's heads off. Kind of like me saying Irish independence and you instantly think of the Omagh or Remembrance Day attack.

&gt;There are plenty of British muslims perfectly okay with secularism, and in fact many who prefer it. Stop trying to pretend that all muslims support your backwards desire to impose your religion on an entire country.

Once again your confused. Are many British Muslims happy with Secularism in the UK? Yeah obviously. Are Muslims in Pakistan, Egypt, Indonesia, Malaysia, Chechnya, Tajikistan and etc for more Islamic laws in their country? Yeah damn right. The Islamist opposition is very often the only real opposition in these countries. Even the most secular Muslim country has Islamic laws.

&gt;You can never guarantee that an entire country wants to be under islamic law. It's impossible.

You can never guarantee that an entire country wants the same thing. However its beyond evidence that people prefer a more religious state.

There are many benefits to spankin' the monkey (or flickin' the bean) before an exam. The most obvious of these is that it substantially reduces your desire to whap your nob out (or slide out your lady garden) and go at it like a dog eating beetroot (thereby distracting other students and making the exam hall all sticky for the remainder of the exam).

Even if you’re one of those people that manages to curtail your urges to a greater extent than I do I’d still recommend beating the meat beforehand as it considerably reduces your chances of suffering that which all teen guys dread most: **THE UNWANTED BONNER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

In the tense environment of an exam hall it’s particularly unpleasant when the crotch zombie rises. There are a large variety of reasons for this that that are far too complex to go into here and can only be properly appreciated after being experienced first-hand. The less mature student may still have some hang-ups about exposing the outline of his rigid man meat to elderly female invigilators and attempt to hide the little fella. 

This in itself can take up a considerable period of the exam and be a source of extreme frustration which will ultimately end with you attempting to balance the desk atop of your unyieldingly solid pickle.

What no one else in this thread seems to have mentioned are the many benefits to masturbating while studying (e.g.  /u/akgamecraft has rather naïvely suggested that the two are mutually exclusive).

I can attest to the *considerable* benefits of gawking at your revision notes just as you’re about to eject your splooge. This makes the time just fly by and will greatly increase your understanding of the material. Although, it may lead to moments of confusion in future relationships when you yell out “**THE MITOCONDRIA IS THE POWERHOUSE OF THE CELL!!!!**” upon firing the flesh musket (and it could also result in minor annoyance when the students next year can’t get the pages of their textbooks to separate properly).

null,false,MyreMyalar,null,null,null,"Burnham and Kendall seem to me to be the two declared candidates setting the agenda for the race. Kendall is thought to be more on the right of the party and Burnham more though to be more on the left. It's interesting to see how they are playing the campaign so far. Kendall is the newbie of the bunch and is opting for a disruptive strategy; declaring first, knocking down the policies of the last campaign first, generally tossing grenades. Meanwhile, Burnham's strategy is to both talk up the benefits of experience and match the rhetoric of the more right leaning candidates. The evening after Kendall had promised that she would support an early EU referendum and the abandoning of the 50p tax rate, Burnham was there to match the promise on the EU and announce that he would toss the mansion tax.

There doesn't appear to be anyone yet trying to outflank Burnham from the left so, right now, his strategy looks likely to succeed. He can hoover up the left by default and make enough inroads through appeals to the right (where he does have some history as well). He's also managed to also use his connections in the party and front runner status to secure a series of high profile endorsements in the PLP from across the ideological spectrum.

In short Burnham is probably now the most popular candidate in the union members voting group, the PLP voting group and the ordinary membership voting group (based on pre-election surveys of shadow cabinet popularity). He is going to be very hard for anyone else to stop, but I look forward to seeing what strategies Kendall tries.

But sure, if you're unable to actually argue points, go ahead and say ""well you're from Northern Ireland so you must be wrong!"".

But to be called 'backward' by a fucking *islamist* is hilarious.

In a few centuries when less than 5% of the world believe in your 9-year-old-fucking warlord prophet, its very clear who historians will think is backward.

&gt;I'm living in the UK because I'm a British Citizen.

That really doesn't answer the question, does it.

I'm not interested in your legal status. I'm interested in why you're choosing to live in the UK if you're an Islamist.

&gt;Go and pick up a single book about history

I think you'll find that history is one of my favourite topics and not only do I pick them up, but *own* many of the great history books.

Reality disagreeing with Islamism does **not** mean I'm ignorant of history.

&gt;If you did you would know that Britain is only the way it is through centuries of genocide, theft, famines and the destruction of other nations

There we go. Keep letting it out! You're only showing people that you're not a ""moderate muslim"" are you claim, you're an infiltrator who hates this country and is only here because Islam has *ruined* the country your family originally came from.

If **you** knew anything about history, you'd know that this hyper-simplistic ""western imperialism ruined the world"" idea is not shared by historians.

&gt;Until Cameron makes thought crime illegal, i'll be doing what ever I do.

As much as I hate Cameron, at least he's being tougher on Islam.

&gt;This is what Muslims have been believing and doing for more than a thousand years.

People believed in slavery, womens' oppression, torture, and execution for centuries.

The west grew up and progressed. We called this the enlightenment.

Islam did not.

That's why the west revolutionised science, technology, politics, ethics, and culture, and took humanity into the new age- the fruits of which you are using to type your comments.

That's why nothing of any scientific or technological significance has been in Arabic for centuries.

&gt;The Islamist opposition is very often the only real opposition in these countries. Even the most secular Muslim country has Islamic laws.

They do, but it's wrong. Theocracy is wrong. It's as simple as that.

The fact that you are supportive of it makes you an islamist, and the vast majority of British people hate islamism.

&gt;You can never guarantee that an entire country wants the same thing.

We realised this in the west, in what we call liberalism. You might have heard about it.

The idea is that *because* of this, you do not impose your values on peoples' personal lives. You keep away from their personal lives as much as is sensible.

This is why we are against islamism, because sharia law is a direct imposition on the personal lives of citizens.",null,0,null,1431884699,null,0,1431885275,0,crc3c2x,null,t3_36911f,null,t1_crc3c2x,null,t1_crc2vgv,null,null,null,1433114808,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

At the end of the day, student unions serve a useful purpose in being a link between the student body and the university organisation.

There are still people in and out of work being made to feel helpless in Johnstone as they queue up at foodbanks to avoid starving. There are still hard working families in Elderslie who are witnessing the price of food go up but their wages remaining stagnant. It is not a museum, it is a place of work - it is the place where these wrongs can be changed.

I'm willing to consider my self wrong but speaking from experience. Yeah NI Loyalists I've come across have been the most backward people I ever meet. Only people I've ever meet to go into a public racist rants .... where are ethnic minorties around. 

&gt;There we go. Keep letting it out! You're only showing people that you're not a ""moderate muslim"" are you claim, you're an infiltrator who hates this country and is only here because Islam has ruined the country your family originally came from. If you knew anything about history, you'd know that this hyper-simplistic ""western imperialism ruined the world"" idea is not shared by historians.

I'm sorry but WTF? How does calling out the British empire for what it was mean I'm a secret muslim infiltrator who wants to destroy the UK. Do I have to hate the UK to say the truth? Am I an a traitor for saying the UK profitted of Slavery while destroying African society? Am I equal to a terrorist if I say that the UK sucked India dry for 200 years to build it's economy. Everything from the Industrial revolution, WW1 and WW2 was based on sucking India dry.

Get out of your bubble. Western Imperialism did destroy. Bengal was one of the richest and most prosperous places in the world before the UK took over. It took a few years of British rule for 30% of the population to be wiped out. Sadly for them they had another 150 years of Empire. By the time the UK left the entire area was destitute and had barely advanced outside of Calcutta.

You maybe reading history but it sounds like the kind of crap Niall and other apologists pour out. Go and read what Indians, Africans and the Chinese are saying. Nobody misses the British Empire. To many it was the epitome of evil.

&gt;As much as I hate Cameron, at least he isn't going to let you barbarians parade around and grow extremism anymore.

You mean the guy who has been sending weapons and other support to terrorists in Syria? Who do you think turned a blind eye to idiot kids heading of to Turkey in 2012/13 when Muslims were warning the government? The idiot thought they would just die in Syria and never be a danger. Lets not forget Libya. If there has ever been a British PM who has helped terrorists then it's Cameron.

&gt;People believed in slavery, women's oppresion, torture, and execution for centuries. The west grew up and progressed. We called this the enlightenment. Islam did not. That's why the west thought the world, and took humanity into the new age- the fruits of which you are using to type your comments. That's why nothing of any scientific or technological significance has been in Arabic for centuries.

Do you really want to go us vs them? Cause all of those scientific and technological processes are built on the work of others. You know Muslim, Indian,Chinese and Ancient scientists. The only difference when these other socities where the ones pushing human advancements. They weren't also sucking other nations dry. Their work wasn't being funded by the same pockets that were stealing from Indian peasants.

Either way we are heading into a new world. The relative decline of the west is more than obvious by now. The rest of the world will be the ones to make the future. The world ebb and flows. People like you sound like the smug Chinese who thought they were superior to Europeans just before the Century of Humiliation.

&gt;They do, but it's wrong. Theocracy is wrong. It's as simple as that. The fact that you are supportive of it makes you an islamist, and the vast majority of British people hate islamism.

I know the difference between the average Brit and me. Hello I'm not some closeted cave dweller. I live in the UK. My best friend is a pork eating, spirit loving atheist. We talk about religion all the time. The average person in the UK looks at it from the sceptical pov. They would never accept something which they don't believe.

Which is why only idiots ever call for any theocratic rule in the UK. That doesn't mean other people around the world are against it. People who advocate for this aren't stupid backward people. There are many educated people around the world who have nothing in common with ISIS or AQ and believe in this.
 
&gt;The idea is that because of this, you do not impose your values on peoples' personal lives. You keep away from their personal lives as much as is sensible. This is why we are against islamism, because sharia law is a direct imposition on the personal lives of citizens.

We share the same principles, just not directly. I don't believe in imposing religious laws on those who don't believe. Islamic law is obviously wrong for Christians and athiests, while Biblical laws is wrong for other. Nobody is saying people should be forced. The difference however between people like me and you is in the view of who should have to follow the rules. I believe that Muslims have to follow Muslim rules in a Muslim country. If you don't want to do that then stop being a Muslim.

Beside me was a table of kitchen staff who were sitting on a break, from where a woman signalled to me that I wasn't to sit beside them but to go up to the back of the room. Confused, I decided to follow her instructions as I am new and she knows what she's talking about. As I began to walk up to the back it became clear what she was talking about as I saw that there was a false partition with a sign saying ""MPs only beyond this point"". The minute I clicked to the division I did a U-turn and walked straight back beside the table of caterers. As I sat down I said to the woman, ""If they want us to be snobby you'd think they would go all out snobby and get a different room instead of a half effort partition?!"" to which the whole table responded with rapturous laughter. As we began to speak more they told us of how many MPs take their position so seriously that they refuse to sit anywhere unless it is exclusively for MPs or Lords. I expressed how ridiculous I found such a position as it actually reminded me of an episode of Friends where Joey can't sit with Ross when he begins working as a tour guide in the museum because, ""blue coats don't sit with white coats"". After good banter the woman said to me, ""You're quite down to earth aren't you?"" to which I responded, ""'Normal' is the word I like to use"" to which she smiled, winked and wished me a good day.

I wouldn't try too hard to try to appeal to Year 10's if you're new and from Canada - no offense here, but they're probably going to see a bit through it and think you're trying a bit too hard. Year 10's are typically right bastards as well, which won't help your case.

If you want to appeal to Year 10s, binge drinking and illicit drugs may be a popular and amusing thing to look at. Football (Soccer) is allways going to appeal to a lot of male teenagers, and some games are quite commonly played by teenageers - for which you're mostly going to be looking at Fifa, Assasin's creed, Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto V, that sort of thing.

Overall though i'd suggest you don't try too hard to appeal to them.

Some teams have better back up keepers that Guzan there top sides but still when a keeper better than you is benched for a world class keeper you can't be that good.

She's basically come up with the idea of calling this political party a cult - everything about the article revolves around that idea. It's a column not a news piece. To enjoy anything about columns you have to use the suspension of disbelief. They're for entertainment purposes generally and to maybe to engender discussion - not hard news. 

And you can't deny that all of the examples she's provided do match up with a cult. There's no two ways about it. That's behaviour that sounds like something a cult does. Well, you probably will - there's not much point though - I've read the piece and her examples of things that are similar to cults gave me a smirk. Because its a well woven piece and I'm sure you're just fucking gutted someone had the balls to call SF a cult and do it quite well. 

Its not that difficult to have a mental check-list of what a cult is and then look for things in another organisation that are synonymous. 

You could do the very same thing to Justin Beiber fans and find similar examples, you could do it with the Jocks and the SNP and find examples, you can do it with anything that has a ""cult following"". 

""What seems to be Ireland's (North and South new biggest party..."" For shits and giggles I'm going to say that that's a cult. Any fast paced, bullshit talking, two faced, propaganda driven, rich and untouchable, pseudo-revolutionary, dubious election tactic using, gang of miscreants who use the idea of class war to get young people behind their cause can be called a cult.

Generally anything that hides its real face and uses a lot of disinformation and manipulation and emotive issues rather than facts is a fucking cult in my book.

null,false,MyreMyalar,null,null,null,"The main reason for the difference between _The Guardian_ and the other papers in the UK is because it is the only one owned by a not for profit trust with a journalist-centric goal. The other papers in UK have their editorial line, and sometimes specific stories dictated to them by their powerful owners. 

The rest of the main UK newspapers are 90% owned by eccentric billionaires who use them as, largely loss making, political tools for their other interests. Murdoch is, of course, the most famous but the tax dodging Barclay brothers that own the _Telegraph_ are even more eccentric. They live on a tiny island, in a castle governed by an archaic medieval system of government - a life worthy of Bond villains, basically.

The aristocratic Rothermere family have had a controlling interest in the _Daily Mail_ for years going back to the papers infamous backing of the Nazis. Though I think the Mail is probably one of the least editorially interfered with papers these days as it is one of the few newspaper companies that makes money. 

The _Daily Express_ is owned by the billionaire porn baron Richard Desmond. It is one of life's great ironies that the elderly &amp; largely conservative UK Independence Party has been enormously funded thanks to the proceeds from millions of literal wankers.

Lastly you have the _Independent_, honourably founded partly in response to the takeover of the British press by eccentric billionaires ( I believe it was Murdoch crushing the print unions &amp; taking over The Times specifically). Worked fine for a while until it lost circulation and advertising money after the rise of the internet. In 2010 the bankrupt paper was sold to the Russian billionaire Oligarch Alexander Lebedev who, in the 2015 election, signalled his intent to use it in the same manner as the other billionaire proprietors, riding roughshod over the editorial department to force the paper to endorse David Cameron.

null,false,KopOut,lfc68,null,null,"&gt;I can understand disappointment with this season, but I would posit that anyone who thinks getting either of these managers will suddenly make us a top-four team, are the delusional ones.

Pretty much everyone who wants Rodgers out (me included) does not think we will instantly become a top 4 club with Rafa or Klopp. You are creating a straw man.

What most of us do believe is that we will have a manager with the clout to help us acquire (and retain) the players necessary to make a sustained go of top 4 over the next few seasons. We will also acquire people that know how to win tournaments and have proven that given the support (of say £100m to spend in a single transfer window) have the ability to adapt quickly and get results.

If you think that top 4 quality players are lining up to play for Rodgers, you are the delusional one.

He has had 3 seasons, he has nothing to show for it. He changes tactics like an oil tanker changes course, and he has our team playing some of the most tepid, gutless football I have ever seen.

We have a good squad of players playing under a manager who quite frankly has now shown (over 3 seasons) that he isn't up to the task. The longer we wait, the harder the task becomes. (and yes, I am aware that he managed 2nd with the 3rd best player on the planet playing the best football he likely ever will).

We will never finish top 4 again, or win a single trophy, with Brendan Rodgers at the helm. Nobody like Suarez (even the Suarez we signed 4 years ago) is going to join up, and the quality we do have will slowly leave. The longer it goes, the fewer options we have.

If you think the transfer committee is the reason we suck, you aren't watching us play. The transfer committee has nothing to do with the way our players set up or go about playing a match. Watch most of this season and tell me Rodgers has performed well.

Brendan Rodgers is not in the same class as Rafa or Klopp. The entirety of the footballing world knows this, and players do too. It is very simple. We had top 4 this season, paid Suarez huge sums, coddled his asinine behaviour and he still wanted away. Sterling is about to do the same.

I don't care if people want to call me fickle or whatever, but Bodgers has been here three seasons now, spent a fucking fortune and has not a single trophy to show for it.

However I get the feeling Rodgers probably will benefit being the only man in charge of the squad next season. Gerrard -as we know all too well from yesterday's media coverage- is a symbol not only for the club, but for the entire City of Liverpool. Rodgers' judgement as a manager will undoubtedly have been clouded by that.

&gt; Klopp has won league titles, multiple domestic cups and reached the final of the Champions League while competing against a team (Bayern)

It's a great feat that Rodgers probably couldn't do but I think it was more due to Bayern having a poor season the first time. It wasn't a tight race...Bayern finished 3rd so 2 teams beat Bayern. In the premier league we have to rely on 4 teams having poor seasons to give us a chance not just one. Also Dortmund's squad back then was much better than our right now. We don't have a consistent squad because of injuries to key players. In 2010/11 Dortmund had 12 players with at least 38 appearances so they had more stability in that sense.

My biggest issue with Rodgers though is his game management and tactics. Yesterday was just another perfect example of that. Moreno was nothing but a liability the entire game, yet Johnson is nowhere to be seen even though it was his last game at Anfield too. Johnson is no where near as good as he used to be, but he has been a great servant to this club and deserved a proper farewell. This part was probably my biggest disappointment yesterday, much more so than the result.

Then there's this constant thing of playing players out of position. Sterling as a lone striker, Can as a CB or RB, Hendo as WB, Marko as WB. I get that things really haven't gone our way this season, but this haven't really been isolated incidents, and more so they haven't really been all that effective. Another thing that bugs me is how Sterling seem to be nigh untouchable when it comes to not playing him/subbing him off. The poor lad have had way too much pressure, playing time and responsibility for a 20 year old. No wonder he gets the impression that he's 'all that'. I think all of this along with the media focus on him (which he is partly responsible for himself) are the reasons he has been increasingly worse for us the further into the second half of the season we've gotten.

Same goes for the two consecutive league title. They only. were competing with Munich, essentially just one team, and Munich were in the process of rebuilding. Klopp has also had a far superior squad to Rodgers, with far superior individual players. The same thing that  happened to Rodgers happened to Klopp when his best players left. Honestly I find it incredibly naive of people to think Klopp could do any better than Rodgers with our current squad. We're the fifth best side in the league. You're fucking laughing if you think Klopp would have jumped us up a few places. We lost our two best players, our two main goal scorers for fuck's sake, of course we were going to suffer. From Christmas up until the United game we were literally the best team in Europe on form. Klopp, on the other hand, faced with a similar situation fucking bottled it big time. So tell me again how magical Rafa or Klopp will come in and fix it. ""Klopp can attract better players!"" That's why all those top players joined Dortmund then? No. Klopp was in the right place at the right time with the right tactics. He's a good manager. He really was a trend setter, but now the rest of the world has caught on.

The problem with English nationalism is twofold: a) it still has the spectre of the right-wing appropriation of it in the post-Empire days hanging over it and probably will for a fair while, especially among the political classes, and b) there is no one united English identity and the cultures in England don't have a huge amount in common with each other.

This second point is the biggest sticking point both in terms of federalism and nationalism in England: during the north-east referendum in 2004 it was easy to spin that ""Newcastle was going to rule Sunderland"" and turn the electorate against regional devolution. 

English is more of a geographical label or a term allocated a certain, specific group of dialects and cultures that are from the geographical area. But people in Cumbria and people in Kent will have totally different ideas of what ""English"" means, whereas in Scotland there is much more of a unified identity, even if it does come somewhat from romanticism in the mid-19th century.

I mean, in Northumberland we still wear kilts, play pipes and dance with swords. If you said that to someone in the south, they wouldn't automatically think that we have an English culture. Equally, morris dancing is not something we do, despite the fact that it's a quintessentially ""English"" tradition.

Therefore it's hard for ""English nationalism"" to take off beyond supporting the football team and the monarchy. I speak differently and do different things to people in Cornwall even if we're both English. The fact that these divisions are sometimes concentrated to which side of a river you were born on makes all-English devolution and mechanisms hard to implement.

If you had a nationwide federalist party that might be a better proposition.",null,0,null,1431889411,null,0,false,0,crc5sk6,null,t3_369v5i,null,t1_crc5sk6,null,t3_369v5i,null,null,null,1433115967,null,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8,null

Was it really? I think the team has overachieved after that awful summer transfer window. I think people don't realise how much that window fucked our chances for the season. We brought in 3 ""senior"" players (Lallana, Lovren, Balotelli) who we expected (at least I hope we expected) to improve us straight away in some ways. You could have argument that we brought in quite a few expensive young players but no one can possibly expect immidiate great performances from all of the 20 year olds we brought from other leagues. More often than not they need time to adapt and even then they might not just work out - that's the risk with 20 year olds from overseas.

But to the senior players again - three additions is way too few! Transfers have much less than 1/2 chance of succeeding. Two of them were clearly failures, Lallana would've probably been clear success but for the injuries. He's been the unluckiest of our summer transfers. Well, shit happens, we barely got 1/3 success rate out of these 3 if we count Lallana as ""OK"" but my problem with it is not there. It's the fact that Liverpool's transfers are about 50% younger players. You can't see that ratio anywhere in bigger clubs. It's up to FSG to change it, it's their policy. It's handicapping the team. It flat out decreases the chance of success for transfers. Add the fact that we put our all hopes of goalscoring on injury prone striker and a huge gamble from Italy and you get a recipe for disaster.

In a hindsight, the team was fucked after the transfer window closed. We clearly players that are more ready than Markovic, Moreno and co. That's what everybody thought we were doing before the summer, even before Suarez leaved.

I understand whole heartedly it's hard without a fit Sturridge and the transfer committee fucking up in the summer, but as a manager you've got to make use of the players we have, and sticking with the same system over again is really not helping, and continually playing players out of their natural positions may work for a couple of games but will come undone in the long run, which can be seen with Can at right back.

It seems as if Rodgers believes in his way so much he is too stubborn to change. Great managers adjust; mourinho, fergie, rafa , ancelotti, etc. BR in this sense reminds me a lot of pep (poor mans) but he has barca and Bayern players and their transfer policy to back his style up. We have to be realistic and if he doesn't have the players he needs to adjust his style at times. Games like the one against Chelsea last season, countless times against counter attacking sides, all of the CL this year season, villa in the fa. Ive lost faith , this man just doesn't seem to have the clutch gene in him he makes mistakes at the costliest time. 
Its an extremely tough call and I do not want to turn into a club that shows no patience or loyalty because truly the passion is what made me love this club, its fans out signing milan down 3-0 at halftime, its players, the aura,  everything that makes this club special. But I would welcome new blood of course klopp or another big name.

null,false,BrokenClockwerk,lfc50,,null,"In the PL games since we played United, they have picked up 10 points from 21. We have picked up 8 from 21. We know mistakes happen. A team that's destined to win the title can lose it. A team that's bottom of the league at Christmas can pull of a great escape. An unlucky injury or a single player's stroke of good form can change everything.

After the United game, we were 5 points behind them with 8 games to go. That's not an easy obstacle, but it's not impossible either. They did a good job beating us and City, but they also lost against Chelsea, drew against Arsenal, and lost against Everton and West Brom.

Our heads dropped after the United game. We needed to announce that we were still a great team. We needed to prove we could turn it around. Instead, we came out and gave a gutless performance as Arsenal battered us to the tune of 4-1.  Now we were 8 points behind with 7 games to go. That's more difficult, but still not impossible.

Rodgers and the team seemed to give up. We put in poor performance after poor performance, culminating in getting knocked out of the FA Cup, dropping points to West Brom, Hull, and Palace, and having poor, nervy wins against QPR and the worst team in the league on form, Newcastle.

If we had turned even 2 of those 3 games (WBA, Hull, Palace) into wins, we'd still have a chance at top 4. If we'd won all three, we'd have 71 points, Manchester United would need to win to even have a chance, and we could seal Top 4 with a win against Stoke. There are no bad teams in the Premier League, but it wasn't even that we lost those games. It's how we lost them.

I like Rodgers, and I wouldn't hate it if he stayed next season, but two years in a row we'd have a soul-crushing match (Manchester United this season, Chelsea last season), and been unable to kick on afterwards.

null,false,listyraesder,null,null,null,"The consolidation of the ITV companies was intentional, with Thatcher intending the high bidder to win the franchises even if they were heading to a monopoly.

One problem with the IBA-era ITV is the waste involved in having 15 sets of production facilities in England and Wales. As audiences demand more production value, more sophisticated facilities are required and bigger production bases for crew and support companies to base themselves. Apart from a few cities, there just isnt the regular work they'd need.

Local TV worked because it was very basic. An hour's drama would be shot almost in one take entirely in the studio, and it'd take 90 minutes to produce. Today an hour drama (not soaps) takes 7 working days to shoot. Many franchises back then could barely afford to make network programming at all, leaving the bulk to Granada, Anglia, Yorkshire, and the London franchises. Indeed many of the franchise holders were big businesses in other sectors, such as Granada (cinemas), Carlton (video editing) et al and so TV was a bit of an afterthought. 

The franchises weren't particularly healthy businesses either, with even Lew Grade's ATV in financial straits from day one.

Today there's a professional broadcaster in rude financial health, largely built up over the past 5 years. With the wet flop of Local TV in the last 18 months no-one's looking to break up a successful British international business. 

The reduction in regional news is regulated by Ofcom, and protection of local newspapers is one factor in scaling back operations, as is the increased cost of offering a sophisticated news service.

This is weird though, because English and Scottish people don't appear to differ nearly as much on an issue by issue basis as their voting habits suggest. This is cause for hope. But English politics needs a genuine, positive grassroots political movement, like the independence campaign was up here (not just one which encourages the working classes to point the finger of blame at other poor people...), and I don't know where that's going to come from..

null,false,EyeSpyGuy,lfc50,,null,"&gt; This is what I greatly question Rodgers for. It somewhat feels like he can't motivate players enough and kind of lost a little or may be more in the dressing room. His transfers are questionable over the period of three years. Easily throws players under the bus.

Then how was the team able to sustain its winning streak end of last season? in spite of Rodgers? I find that hard to believe. I remember when the Being Liverpool documentary showed people were making fun of his 'David brent' ways and the ""cringey"" envelopes stunt as an indication of his managerial acumen. He may not have the best record with player relations, but at worst you can say its been hit or miss. His handling of Mignolet's poor form has been incredibly well handled, and his handling of the Suarez situation especially in regards to the release clause snafu led us to our best season in recent memory. I agree that expectations which we had at the start of the season and our current spot are less than satisfactory, but not so much so that we can be considered a worse team than at the point when he came in. At the time we could see that he spent, yes, but on unproven, sometimes injured talent, when the bigger factor was the *loss* of our players (Agger, Suarez, etc) which coupled with the Sturridge injury means we were left with our hands tied behind our back. It being Rodger's first season in Europe at all, much less the Champions League, meant we were generally naive on the whole tactically.

null,false,gin0clock,null,null,null,"Dortmund have been worse than us this season. That's what pisses me off about the Klopp talk. If some of you actually go and watch any games from the first half off their season, you'll see that they were absolutely dreadful. Yeah, they struggled with injuries, but so did we. Christ, imagine how bad Dortmund would have been if Aubameyang had been out for the entire season like Sturridge. They would be absolutely fucked.

Rafa lost the fucking plot here. I don't know how short term your collective memories are; but this is a guy who sold Xabi Alonso because he wanted Gareth Barry. **Gareth Barry**. A guy who had his moment of glory with us ten years ago - that lovely, warm, fuzzy nostalgic feeling in yer belly isn't going to win us games and isn't going to see us progress as a club. 

Rodgers is a **long term** manager. As I keep repeating over and over and over again; he has dragged us to 5th place this year. No it's not great, of course it isn't, but we didn't have a fully fit striker we could rely on, we lost the third best player in the world, Arsenal, City and Chelsea have never been richer and United have never been more desperate for success. Had Sturridge been fit, I think Stevie was totally right in saying we would have reached top 4. Brendan deserves at least another season before we do call for the chopping block.

I'd like to make two more points. 

* Do any of you ***really*** want to see Kenny back as caretaker manager half way through a season again? Because that's what'll happen if we fire Rodgers with a knee-jerk reaction. 

* If Rafa comes, he will not bring Higuain, Hamsik, Callejon &amp; Mertens. If Klopp comes, he will not bring Reus, Hummels, Gundogan &amp; Aubameyang. This isn't bloody FIFA.

For example: most forms of trade mark infringement require that there is some risk of confusion. If there's no risk of confusion, there's no infringement. 

However that is not always true. Where a mark has a ""reputation"" in the UK, it can be an infringement to take unfair advantage of it in circumstances where it is obvious to everyone that you are not the trade mark owner, see s10(3):

http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1994/26/section/10

In practice some trade mark owners are highly aggressive (in particular they don't want their marks to become generic) and will not only threaten to sue but will actually sue relatively easily. Others will issue threats but not act on them (since the threat is cheap, action is not). Whether or not it is worth taking $500 is almost impossible to say, you'd need to weigh up things like (i) how much it was worth to you (ii) what risk you'd be taking in not settling with them which might include (iii) how much it would cost you to take proper legal advice (almost certainly more than $500).",null,0,null,1431893843,null,0,false,0,crc87yg,null,t3_35z5kd,null,t1_crc87yg,null,t1_cr97sfc,null,null,null,1433117111,null,1,false,LegalAdviceUK,t5_32g6u,1,null

null,false,DamaskDream,eng-yorkshire,People's republic of Teesside,null,"I currently study Politics and Philosophy.  I applied to both PPE courses and philosophy and economics at 5 different universities.

Just to clarify about PPE: The Oxford model for PPE is to teach the three subjects independently and not make a huge fuss about their massive overlaps.  Warwick's PPE course on the other hand makes it rather explicit that they *differ* from Oxford in the sense that their teaching style places a greater emphasis on the interdisciplinary nature of the three subjects.  This approach is common for nearly all other major universities that aren't Oxford.  Few universities offer PPE outside of Oxford, Warwick, Durham, and York.  LSE are introducing a PPE course for next academic year.

The main difference between PPE and P&amp;E is, well, no politics.  Its as simple as that.  You will most likely get outside options, in which you can take economics modules, but you will only be awarded a degree in Philosophy and economics.  

Don't do Philosophy and economics if you're not at least somewhat passionate about both.  In PPE you can get away with disliking one of the subjects.  With a dual-honours degree, you can't really do it whilst hating half the time you spend on it.  That's one thing to consider.

Another thing to consider is the employability factor.  Any politics or philosophy based degrees are good for a large number of professions, from management to teaching.   Having the economics component will be attractive to employers, as it signals that you have quantitative skills as well as qualitative ones, whereas my degree does not signal that.   Philosophy and Economics is perhaps the most unconventional combination of the three disciplines, but has the added benefit of having a quantitative side to it.  

In the end, Oxford PPE stands head and shoulders above any other form of the degree at any other university. That's a fact, albeit one that doesn't really affect you.  Outside of Oxford PPE, the degrees of employability, of course difficulty, of teaching style become so marginal.

If you don't mind dropping politics, P&amp;E is certainly a good option.  But if like my politics was indispensable, consider Politics and philosophy, or try and find a way to do PPE.

One thing is for certain: you will enjoy doing a dual-honours degree.  I've not met anyone who does one who doesn't enjoy the breadth of knowledge and skills they can learn from studying two or more disciplines concurrently.  Don't be tempted to drop down to single-honours, my instinct is you will regret it.

I'd say that Stones is the standout option for me, and I would have said Laporte however he's had a fairly quiet season so I'd much rather wait and see if he's the real deal and not just a sick FIFA purchase. Inigo Martinez from La Real is someone who I'm particularly keen on, but he's come through their academy and Moyes won't let him leave easily.


Varane clearly has it, but do we want to pay £40 mil for a defender who plays in a very similar style to Zouma - I'm not sure if they'd pair together well as they're both very strong and athletic, but I get the feeling we need someone more composed and with better ball playing skills to maintain balance.


RE: Buying Stones and loaning him back to Everton, I'm not sure that would be feasible. I doubt their fans would be too happy about that and it would likely cause them more harm than good.

Actually, it suddenly occured to me that you might be implying that we switch to a 4231 type formation in that case. if so, all good

Here is a line up i made a couple weeks ago and I stand by it. Obviously switch Kruse with someone of similar ilk because that guy is going to Wolfsburg i think. Also, add in Wisdom (or Enrique*) maybe to make it a 25 man squad

While it seems inconceivable that the UK would ever use a nuclear weapon, simply deciding to disarm now would not yield financial savings in the next Parliament nor would it give us leverage in global nuclear disarmament talks. Thus, we believe a step down the nuclear ladder towards a minimal yet credible deterrent offers the best balance of deterrence coupled with a clear commitment to disarmament.

What is the alternative approach to Trident?

We would end continuous at-sea deterrence, but exercise the submarine capability regularly to maintain relevant skills. Through fewer submarines and reduced manpower, we could save money. Adopting this posture would represent the biggest step down the nuclear ladder that the UK or any established nuclear power has ever taken. It would keep the nuclear option open for the future, and would contribute more significantly to nuclear disarmament, enabling us to focus on conventional capabilities to defend our interests and be a force for good around the world.",null,0,null,1431894514,null,0,false,0,crc8ld2,null,t3_3696dt,null,t1_crc8ld2,null,t1_crc8gst,null,null,null,1433117286,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Whilst I agree any negative effect has to be taken into account, it's a very minor effect.  Especially when 0.6% of fuck all is still fuck all.  Or to look at it more seriously, someone working full time on minimum wage is losing out on £81.12 a year.  And I'd hazard a guess that the bottom 5% of the population aren't working full-time, so those figures will be considerably lower.

Also worth noting from the BBC

&gt; is that as soon as the Bank were to see a tightening in the labour market, it would pre-emptively increase interest rates, to choke off demand and any serious rise in inflation.
So if living standards were to rise thanks to a rise in wages, they would almost certainly be simultaneously depressed by a rise in mortgage and other interest rates on households' record debts.

I have posted my issues with him over and over again, and many people in this thread have already covered most of what I think. However, there are two things I've noticed aren't being discussed that I would like to add:

First, I think a big issue with the people who want Rodgers to stay is that they've bought into this image that Rodgers has very intentionally created for himself. From day one, Rodgers has fancied himself as a Shankly. Admittedly, this is the right attitude one should have when becoming the manager of Liverpool. But when looking at him objectively by reviewing what he's said, done, and the results we've gotten, he's much closer to a Hodgson in reality. 

Also, another thing that isn't being discussed is that any of the other top teams would be sacking him at the end of this season, if not already. I don't think that can even be debated. They would. United sacked Moyes for a similar season - his *first* season in charge, and he was even hand-picked by Fergie. Granted, United probably would have been disappointed with whoever Ferguson's successor was, but that didn't change the fact that they didn't consider him good enough.

null,false,rydleo,null,null,null,"Let me answer the question with a question to begin with- do you watch a fair amount of Dortmund games?  Having watched both us and Dortmund quite a bit, for me, Klopp is simply the better manager.  His tactics are generally good, his substitutions logical, and his changes in game pretty well spot on.  He perhaps does rely a bit too much on sticking with his style of play, but overall I'd rate him the far superior manager to Brendan and part of that is he simply more experienced having been a first team manager for 14 years or so since he went from being a Player to a Manager at Mainz.  I'd also say Klopp is a superior man manager, is generally loved by all supporters for his passion, and is much better at identifying acquisitions, although to be fair on that last bit I'm not entirely sure how much or little Klopp does there versus Zorc.

As for my expectations if we got Klopp- 

- I would expect us to be challenging for top 4, as we sort of did this season.  
- I would expect us to be identifying and filling holes we have within the squad instead of stockpiling players we don't need.  
- I would expect us to promote youth where needed and give them a proper go of it.  
- I would expect that every performance the team would look organized and play to a high level with a good degree of confidence, even if results aren't going our way.  
- I would expect that we'd maybe finally come up with a method for defending set pieces.  
- I would expect us to play attractive football every game, not worry about how much possession we have.  
- I'd expect us to field a team that can play to a high standard both offensively and defensively at the same time.

All of that said, I am under no illusion that Klopp is someone who will wind up at Liverpool as frankly I expect it unlikely.  Same for Rafa as otherwise I would have thought FSG would have hired him when he was not doing anything last time.  That doesn't mean all of the things I expect/would like to see are not completely doable by someone else, be it Schmidt, Favre, Dournier, De Boer, Yakin, etc.  There are a lot of very good, progressive younger managers out there, it's not just Klopp or Rafa.",null,0,null,1431895900,null,0,false,0,crc9aym,null,t3_36a7a1,null,t1_crc9aym,null,t3_36a7a1,null,null,null,1433117621,null,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6,null

All of this hinges, however, on finding strikers who can a) stay healthy and b) play alone up top.   

I would see the holding players as Hendo, Lucas, Milner (?) and Can, with Allen as a utility backup.  In the attacking band, Sterling, Coutinho, Lallana, Markovic, Ibe, and Origi should give plenty of options.  This leaves Sturridge and Ings (?) alone up top, which is just not good enough.

His transfers have been godawful for the most part. I simply don't trust him with money anymore. Everyone the club has brought in has been either mostly poor/average, or we massively overpaid for them, with the exception of Sturridge, Coutinho, Sakho, and Emre Can. And if the rumors are true, those were all committee signings, and not Rodgers'.

I also don't think his man management is nearly as good as people claim it is. Say what you want about Balotelli, but I think its fairly obvious that Rodgers has misused him and almost isolated him. And going back a ways here, his decision to move Agger on is highly questionable. Even further back, I still can't believe he got Nuri Sahin to come here, and then played him relatively little, out of position, and then let him leave halfway through the season. I'm sure there are other examples, but thats just a few off the top of my head.

I don't. I think we'd be comfortably above United. I think we'd have killed off Palace yesterday, I think we'd have killed off Hull a few weeks ago and I think we'd have pushed for third. 

I disagree with your point that all three seasons have been 'failures'. Dalglish had put Rodgers in a near impossible position when he took over, an over-paid, over-rated, under-motivated squad and before we targetted any kind of CL qualification or league success that needed to be addressed. The second half of Rodgers first season, once Coutinho and Sturridge came in, was absolutely amazing. Sure, didn't win any trophies, but we destroyed nearly every team put ahead of us.

Second season, we over-achieved. Suarez pushed on to become the third best player in the world and we fell short. Had we won, Suarez might have stayed but nobody anticipated second and we got second while playing **the most** entertaining football that the league had seen for years. 

This year was a different challenge, we had to compete in the domestic competitions and Europe without Daniel Sturridge fit. Balotelli was never going to cut it here, sadly nor was Lambert and somehow Rodgers steered us to 5th in the league without playing a striker for most of the season and a semi-final of a cup.

Yeah, fine. No Champions league, bit disappointing. No cup, also disappointing, but I don't believe for a second anyone can say that if we had Daniel Sturridge fit 100% of the season we would have done exactly as we had done. 

The biggest problem I have with the club (not Rodgers because I have a feeling he doesn't get much of a say) is that not a single striker was signed to replace Suarez or to support Sturridge. We went cheap, we went sentimental, we went irresponsible. We should have signed better strikers. That's the real failure of this season.

It's great when it comes off, but it's difficult to pull off. What do I mean? Take the Arsenal game for instance. Arsenal pressuring us. What should we do? Play a couple of long balls, make THEIR backs turn to their own goal and pressure them from that. Then, that stops Arsenal pressing so high on us. What does Rodgers do? Insists on playing it at the back working collectively. Because his whole philosophy is based on that, with the belief that his insistence will lead to fruition in the future.

Does that mean Rodgers isn't a winner? Not at all. But what he has got to realise is that the clock is ticking and the results are the most important thing.

I run Flexget on a seedbox. It will automatically check your torrent sites for you, download the torrent file and add it to your torrent client, and if you hook it up to the pushbullet API then it'll also send a notification to your phone. So you don't get a notification when a new show starts, but rather you get a notification each time a new episode of your show is downloaded and waiting for you. You have to compile a list of all your favorite shows, but then you're done. And all of this is free, except for renting a seedbox, but you could also just run it on your home computer.

You could also probably use [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) to do something similar, but I'm not expert on that.

I find it difficult to believe that the SNP outflanked Labour when their manifesto was pretty much an identikit clone of the Labour manifesto with a few lines like ""stronger for Scotland"" and ""Scotland's voice"" thrown in for good measure.

It was written as a love-letter to Labour because they thought that they would be propping up Labour in government and wanted to put out the barebones of a deal.

You need to bear in mind that this season, our core defence has been one consistent CB in Skrtel, and a goalkeeper that was 'dropped indefinitely', a 21 year old midfielder being played out of position out of necessity, and Lovren who had a horrendous start to the season and was too nervous to do anything but pass sideways/backwards until a few weeks ago.

And Scottish nationalism wasn't the immediate response to Thatcher of course, though the one did cause the other. The immediate response was to vote Labour in droves and to work towards devolution, to creating a line of defence between Scottish voters and the Tory party. People only moved over to the SNP at Holyrood quite gradually. First it was a lukewarm protest vote, against Blair and the Iraq War etc. But the SNP proved themselves to be very popular and competent at leading devolved politics, and they have been rewarded for it.

The final piece of the puzzle is of course the independence referendum, which made everyone reconsider what the point of politics is, and why they vote for who they do. The SNP, to their credit, engaged a lot of people who have been sidelined by political parties in recent years. I suppose an EU referendum could do the same for UKIP, if they play it smart...

null,false,GoodBoyGoneRad,null,null,null,"First just to point out we didn't lose 3-0 to United at Anfield, that was at O** T*******. We lost 2-1 at Anfield.

i just struggle to find your optimism. Yes we have created chances and had we had Sturridge things would probably have been different.

But as a top flight manager you have to cater for the fact your players are going to get injured, not play as well as they can, things just won't work etc.
We were appalling in the first half of the season. Rodgers took half the season to come up with a new tactics and formation to suit the squad, and yes it worked, but that isn't what you expect from any manager. You've got to be able to adapt and change things, that's what top managers do.
I've defended Rodgers most of this season. Losing Suarez was a huge blow and we were poor at the start of the season. I can accept that. The Champions League, whilst hugely disappointing, wasn't unexpected, I don't blame Rodgers that much for that, he's never managed in Europe before.
It's recently I've lost faith in him. Losing to United was a massive blow, but that happens, those games are like nothing else. But that surely has to be one of the easiest games to motivate your players after. yes we lost the battle, but we're still fighting, we could and should have been aiming to catch them (it's quite clear now we could have done.) But watching the games against Arsenal, Hull, West Brom etc. we've looked apathetic. You'd never have guessed we had anything to play for. Rodgers should have had those players playing for their lives, knowing we still had a chance. Knowing it's Gerrard's last season, knowing all the criticism we've come under. If we'd played our hearts out and were still in the position we are now, then it's a lot easier pill to swallow.
The FA Cup is the same story, we scraped our way to the Semi, and with very little else to play for at that point. Knowing it's Gerrard's last chance at silverware, on his birthday, it was like it was written in the stars. Yet stood at Wembley watching those players, again you'd never have guessed. That's not to say say all of the players, but against Villa you expect to see sharp passing, throwing yourself in to tackles, fighting every loss ball, instead I saw us get torn apart by 20 year old.
For me Rodgers takes the blame for that, and most importantly, because this is the major problem, I haven't seen him learn from any of this. I haven't seen him learn much in 3 years. He could and hopefully be a top class manager one day, but right now he's not, and until he can really learn from his mistakes, learn to adapt his formations and tactics and really motivate his players, he's not what we need in charge of our club right now.

I also find it a bit strange that you don't see Klopp as a better tactician then Brendan.  In my eyes they are miles apart- Brendan is poor tactically (playing a very slow 3 at the back against Bolasie and Puncheon just a recent example), is poor at substitutions (see Lallana off from just yesterday), and generally leaves it to late to try and change the game (again, yesterday).  These are all things in my mind he's struggled with all season.  I will admit Klopp is pretty dogmatic about his approach to the game and that is a concern as the PL is a bit different than the Bundesliga but overall I really do think he is the better of the two.

As far as who has joined Dortmund under Klopp, there was Subotic, Hummels, Reus, Lewandowski, Kagawa, Gundogan, Bender, Piszczek, Grosskreutz, Kampl, Aubameyang and a bunch of others I'm probably not thinking of.

I really think we have to cut her some slack and forgive her youth. Yes, she seems rather naive. Yes, there's a good chance that in five years' time she'll be a very different politician with very different beliefs to the ones she professes now - but isn't that to be expected? By the time of the next election, she'll have grown from 20 to 25. I don't know about you, but I grew a lot in that time. And her naivety - again, what would you expect? I was still a teenager at that age, really, and I had a lot of firm opinions - and identities around those opinions - that melted away fairly quickly after university.

Whilst I'm not a fan of the SNP - I find them populist, unrealistic and a smidge smug - I wonder if Ms. Black is really much worse than so many of the rent-a-politicos that fill the corridors of Westminster. Is a 20 year old student really a much worse force for change than a 40 year old barrister with a PPE degree?

How is that such an amazing achievement that we should sack our manager for him? It's exactly what Rodgers did, but without the terrible (like, actually terrible, not just poor) start. Rodgers showed the ability and confidence to rescue our season with change of formation resulting in a string of wins that got us back in contention and have just missed out at the end.

The parallels between Dortmund and us this season are uncanny, including our managers. It's just a bit puzzling to hear people tout Klopp as he solution to all our problems, when he had an even more polarised (terrible, then great) season than ours.

It might just be I'm realistic about our financial position and have resigned myself to accepting that as long as our squad is the 5th highest in value in the Prem, and we pay the 5th highest wages, we're probably going to finish 5th more often than not. Season's like last will be the special ones, and cups will be nice every few years, but Rafa, Klopp or even Mourinho won't make us regular Premiership contenders or CL finalists with our current financial position and I fear too many people believe they would. 

Also, not enough people actually understand that Rodgers isn't solely to blame for our poor transfer activities.

Same with logistics/mechanic/engineers etc.

How can you be so sure he won't? He'll obviously not look on back on his career and think of that match, but when he specifically thinks of his last match at Anfield, I don't know how he is supposed to not remember the fact that they played like shit and got beat 1-3 by Crystal Palace. 

&gt;Part of the reason we lost yesterday was sentimentality, I'm sure that everyone was feeling the emotions. Also the players were trying harder to get Gerrard a goal than win the game passing to him, who was playing more advanced than usual, when they would have usually had a shot.

What an absurd statement. We lost because we played like shit. Thats it. Gerrard was a passenger for most of too. I don't remember anyone trying to set up Gerrard more than usual either. And Gerrard was only playing more advanced after Lucas came on.

&gt; “You get a style of policing where the first options are teargas, rubber bullets and water cannon, which are the 
&gt;last options in the UK.”

So, hold on a second, because your budget is being cut and the population voted for a party you don't like, your going to be forced to become a paramilitary force?

How much does a paramilitary cost the UK?, How much do water cannons cost? How about guns that fire rubber bullets?  Funny thing about the 80's is that I rarely saw coppers with tasers, rubber bullets and they rarely carried guns, now in the 21st century I rarely see cops without those things.  Maybe you need to rethink where your making cuts mate.


&gt;But May and her advisers believe some members of the police force use over-the-top rhetoric in predictions that &gt;cuts would lead to chaos on the streets

I'm no fan of Theresa May and her snoopers charter, which I think will put a huge burden on the police, and end privacy for decades to come, but on the other hand I do agree that the police may be using over-the-top rhetoric when they say they're going to become a paramilitary force and give up investigating crimes, that does actually sound like over-the-top rhetoric.

They've already done as such in West Yorks.

My constituencies local schools have been ""pushed"" towards becoming an academy or being threatened with becoming single form schools (this is bad as it puts pressure on the staff, reduces the schools funding, increases class sizes and generally results in the school heading to poor performance).

Schools which become academies are ""rewarded"" by allowing them to become 3 form schools and are given large budgets to ""remodel"" the school.

My childs current school is under an agenda by the local council to ""improve"" standards or face the above changes. When this information was brought to the School Councillors Board (who my wife was part of at the time), the School Councillors were told and I quote

""Keep this quiet. We do not want parents knowing about these changes"".

Shortly afterwards staff started 'leaving' or being on record as ""long term sick"".

This is a common ploy done by staff as they want to avoid being associated with a reformed school or one put in remedial measures.

This also matches information I have seen during my tenure as a finance worker for the council, who have been preparing to authorise large sums of money to ""new academies"" and supporting documentation from Children and Young Peoples Services citing a cut back in staff.",null,0,null,1431900894,null,0,1431901125,0,crcc18u,null,t3_36a5sh,null,t1_crcc18u,null,t3_36a5sh,null,null,null,1433118919,null,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7,null

Getting away from midfield and into attack though, if Balotelli was the 20 goal a season striker that the football world thought he was (that he actually was at Milan last year) then that plan would be fine and we'd go with it. Fact is, he's got 4 goals for us this season and only 1 of those in the league. Obviously he hasn't played **that** much but Sturridge has 4 goals in the league in 12 appearances, none of which he's been fully fit in.

Wingbacks or fullbacks?   Two holding mids or one?  Without knowing this I would imagine it's very difficult for the scouts and transfer committee to figure out what sort of players to target as identifying the weaknesses or areas we need improvement in is near impossible to say nothing of trying to coach that sort of formation.  Flexibility is nice, but for me it makes more sense to pick something first then add to it over time rather than trying to build a team to play in very different formations.  Sort of jack of all trades, master of none for me when I think we need to master something first.

In addition to that, I think he's tactically mediocre at best, makes bizarre substitutions, and has relatively poor in game management.  His signings have been largely poor as well, although how much of that is committee and FSG related seems to be a frequent matter of debate.

As for strengths- I think he's a very good individual coach.  If we look at how much he's improved say Skrtel's ability on the ball, as an example, I think it's been quite a lot.  Same for other players who individually it's clear to me have improved in terms of ability under Rodgers.  By all accounts his training sessions are well run, organized, make good use of time, target specific areas he deems of use (generally related to possession of the ball and passing), and most of the players seem to enjoy them which can be hard to do.

Short version is I think he's a very good coach, but not a great manager.  Part of that is he's still very green with this being only his 7th season of managing a first team and only his 4th in the top flight.

If you want the *best* experience, then the answer is still 'London'. In terms of size, scale, energy and 'international-ity', there really isn't anything that compares. Is it expensive? Accommodation is, yes, but there are more opportunities to earn money if you're in the right kind of industry. The cost of living is higher than elsewhere in the UK, but events, nightlife and dining out isn't too expensive due to the degree of competition. It's a great place to be if you've got a decent job, but I'm not sure you'll have one lined up yet, if you'll excuse my presumption.

If London isn't an option, you might try Manchester. It is sometimes regarded as the UK's second city, but it's a fair bit smaller than London. I don't know how 'international' it is; it does have two universities, though, and they'll have a lot of foreign students. It is fairly famous for its nightlife and cultural highlights. Work-wise, you'll find what you want if you're after student-y jobs - bar staff, retail, restaurant service - but if you've got something more substantial in mind (not to be dismissive of those kinds of jobs), you might find it trickier to get what you want.

So -**in theory**- our strikers this season (if they performed the same level as last years) should have scored 74 goals. 

Obviously, football isn't about theory and how things work on paper. Our transfer committee let us down massively with the signings and it's pretty clear looking back that Rodgers didn't have a lot of say in the matter. The strikers didn't fit the system and didn't perform to the same level as last season and we were punished for signing players based on their records and statistics.

Harry was sacked after finishing above the winners of the Champions League. We've been going backwards ever since. AVB was hired and fired after making the exact same mistakes we saw him make at Chelsea. Pochettino was hired on the back on one good season at Southampton and we've just had our worse season since Redknapp was brought in to save us from relegation. Our defence has conceded the same number of goals as Burnley and more than Hull, which is disgraceful.

You marvel at the 10m deal with Hull. I'll continue lamenting the shocking 75m thrown away on Paulinho, Soldado and Lamela.

As I've said in a seperate post. Lambert, Balotelli &amp; Borini combined scored 50 goals between them last season. Suarez scored 31. In theory that fire-power, combined with having Sturridge for lets say 50% of the season, would probably have been enough to get us into the top four. The fact is that Balotelli, Lambert and Borini have been painfully disappointing. 

Nobody can sit here and say the expected the three of them to score 50 between them this year, of course not, that'd be fucking stupid.

What it comes down to is expectations.


I'll give Rogers until Christmas but here are some thoughts:

1. ""Transition period"" is not an excuse anymore.

People babble on about needing to transition post Suarez but anyone who says that is really think harder on what transition actually implies. The players who we bought should be expected to get into the first team and play at least around 80% of their ability with the further 20% coming from settling into the team. Has it happened? no. The players honestly look like a rubbish tip.

Let's look at our signings:

1. Emre Can: Has to be played outside his normal position.

2. Alberto Moreno: Is the only fit player for his position so more or less has to be played.

3. Adam Lallana: We paid 25 odd million for someone who has only done slightly better than Downing did. His goal against palace? something I'd expect any player from League one to put away. He did good to pressure it but ultimatly it was a shit pass from the palace defender that went behind his teammate and Lallana put the 1 moment in 5 game effort his done for us this season to chase it down.


4. Lambert? honestly, for 4 million pounds we could have found another striker who would at least be played. 


5. Balotelli? for 16million pounds he was worth the punt but clearly is either not being used correctly or Rogers just didn't want him in the first place.


6. Lovren? Replacement for Agger? fuck off. The guy had one golden season, probably the best he has ever played in his career and when asked to adapt and change he is probably the worst defensive signing we've had in the premier league.


7. Markovic? for 20million pounds on a 21 year old I sort of expected better. Would have been better if he went on loan in January if we weren't bogged down by injury problems. His being asked to play out of position yes, but even in his proper position he has shown nothing too flashy. Ibe has done more than him this season. 


8. Origi? hasn't played for us.



You still want to talk transition period? look at Southampton. They lost one of their biggest goal threats (Lambert) and their captain and leader (Lallana) and one of their solid defenders (Lovren) to us. They were picked to be relegated this season and yet, they are only a few points behind us. They signed players that started off making themselves known rather than needing 12months to ""transition"".



So my conclusion on Rogers in vs Rogers out.


Rogers In

 - Rogers should be given another season. If we start the season playing this shit 3 CB formation than I would want him gone immediately. It worked for a win streak when we had Coutinho and Henderson pulling one out of their arse every other game with the odd defensive fuck up by the other team. I don't think we even won a game during that streak convincingly. If the owners/board give him the transfers he wants I would keep him. 


Rogers Out

 - Another manager could easily squeeze more out of the current squad than he has so far. Their is no passion or desire from the players for the last few months. He seems to view subs as nothing more than replacing the players who can't do 90. We seem to suffer the same problems week in and week out. Shit ability upfront. No movement. No creativity. Pass the parcel style football that leads to nowhere. Ball played to the wingers or wingbacks that ends up in a cross being overhit or underhit or caught be the keeper because the crossing is shit and we have no movement in the box. His last season was only buoyed by Suarez who probably could have went to QPR at the start of the season and made Redknapp look like a tactical god.

I agree with you on this but I think it has more to do with Gerrard being a club legend and Rodgers being pressured to play him. After Gerrard leaves :( Rodgers or the next manager, won't have that pressure on them and will be able play the most suitable player in that position. 

I agree that 4 goals isn't that impressive but we both know that those came from Balo playing as a lone striker in a formation that he really struggles in.

Hopefully Balo doesn't get sold and I think that depends on whether or not Rodgers stays because I think Balo deserves a chance at playing in a front 2 formation where he plays a lot better than as a lone striker.

I can't find any tangible difference between civic nationalism and nationalism, except wishy washy apologists saying that civic nationalism is nationalism without any of the bad stuff.

Even if you look at what we'd both probably consider to be xenophobic nationalists (the BNP for example) then they too claim not to be xenophobic.

The reason it's hard to answer is because civic nationalism is just a synonym for nice nationalism - and that's an entirely subjective definition.

Therefore the money would be better spent on improving our conventional military capabilities. 

However, I don't think the ethical / ideological arguments against it should be disregarded. My (undoubtedly uninformed) understanding of nuclear weapons is that they essentially target civillian populations, therefore the very launch of a nuke would itself constitute a war crime. It targets the innocent populace of a country that would have little to no say in it's government's actions. 

As a deterrent for war in general, it's failed quite spectacularly. If Ukraine still had nukes would Russia have invaded? Would Russia believe that if Ukraine had nukes they would use them? That's where MAD falls down for me, because for it to be a genuine deterrent each side has to believe that the other would be willing to use their weapons... but each side knows the other wouldn't use their weapons because the retaliation would be so great... so it's really just business as usual. 

So we have ended up paying vast sums of money for a weapon that isn't much of a deterrent, has little practical use for modern warfare and the useage of which would be a crime against humanity and potentially end civilisation as we know it.

Just to acknowledge I have zero education in geopolitics so I'd love to discuss this with someone who is pro trident or has more info on the matter.

&gt;I was born in Paisley and have lived all my life there. I am a season ticket holder for Partick Thistle and have always been an ardent fan of football since becoming one of the first girls to play on my Primary School football team. I am also a great lover of music through both playing many instruments and listening to it. 

&gt;I have always been politically motivated, particularly for the pursuit of social justice. I would participate from a very young age in marches such as that for a Scottish Parliament and against the Iraq war. I carried this interest through school and consequently into University where I am currently in my final year studying Politics and Public Policy at the University of Glasgow. 

&gt;Politics is prevalent in all areas of life and it is for this reason I have also been volunteering for different organisations such as Oxfam for many years. I became actively involved during the referendum by campaigning and speaking at various events throughout the campaign. I also had the unique opportunity of travelling all over Scotland with The Margo Mobile campaign, going into some of the most deprived areas in the country. It was here that I witnessed first hand the level of poverty and injustice prevalent in our society. It is for this reason I am running as a candidate for the SNP as I truly believe that the only way to bring the powers we were promised, and the social justice that Scotland so desperately needs, is to have a strong group of SNP MP's at Westminster to ensure our voices are heard.

Sounds pretty normal and real to me. 

True, its hard to have vast life experience when you are only 20 years old, but I don't see her age as an impediment to representing the people of Paisley and Renfrewshire South and nor obviously did they. In fact I suspect a 20 year old knows more about ""real life"" than plenty of the 70+ year olds currently sat in Parliament. The young should be represented too. 

If you are saying there should be certain specifications to be an MP, such as a minimum age I would say that is a dangerous road to go down. We should be opening up politics to more normal, average people not closing it down to an intellectual or financial elite, which is what it would become if you started having an MP check list.

You misunderstand: the issue is not that the text is full width, but that full width designs will have varying widths in practice because of the plethora of user agents and devices users might view a site on. But unless a developer was using an inordinate number of breakpoints, those different widths would be married to the same vertical spacing measure.

As for your own full width text: indeed, that will work fine if you have tweaked your font size and line height. Otherwise your reading speed will be diminished.

The [English Democrats](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Democrats) want an English parliament but not regional english ones, and the Pirate and Green parties seemed in favour of regionalism too. If only the [Regional assemblies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_assembly_(England) had been implemented better and the 2004 North East England regional assembly referendum had achieved a yes vote. I'm still pissed off the referendums in Yorkshire and North West got cancelled as a result. If only John Prescott had campaigned harder for the need for regional English assemblies to the public. 

There is also the now largely defunct [Vectis National Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vectis_National_Party) who wanted the Isle of Wight a crown dependency like the Isle of Man or Channel Islands. There was also the [Free England Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_England_Party) and [England First Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_First_Party) too.

I can also see at least 1 candidate putting themselves forward for regionalist policies in the upcoming Manchester Mayoral elections and any other upcoming Mayoral elections as more city devolution deals are struck across the UK. This because I think the [campaigns for an English parliament](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_for_an_English_Parliament) are picking up speed. But ultimately I think England needs to be split into smaller regional parliaments rather than a single English one because England is so large and diverse. Plus it does little to address the regional imbalances of the north-south divide, London-centrism and I think would just greater encourage English nationalism and anti-unionism. Federalisation could hopefully become a big vote winner in the next election if the public get increasingly agitated with the status quo; something which I think the SNP are central too. E.g. if Labour revisit old policies like how John Prescott had his [Regional Assemblies bill](http://www.parliament.uk/topics/Regional-assemblies.htm) and stuff.

We didn't outplay Palace at all. Their strategy was to let us aimlessly keep possession and counter-attack at pace at our fragile defense, as they don't have cover from the midfield when Gerrard plays the holding role.

Bolasie not on the wing, but straight down the middle gives away their game plan in the entirety.

We don't break down teams that setup well, we don't defend well with Gerrard in the holding role, and we're prone to defensive mishaps anyway. Pardew can figure it out, Warnock, Sherwood, Pulis, Mourinho, Van Gaal, Wenger etc etc. 

Rodgers is being out-managed too many times this season, and it shows his level to be honest. I disagree with people saying we have a mediocre squad and that's why we're having results like we do.

We have the European golden boy, Coutinho, Henderson, Sturridge, Skrtel, Sakho and Lucas who are all quality players.

Then surrounding them we have some incredible talents in Moreno, Markovic, Ibe, Can etc.

This club is in a good place right now squad wise. We're missing some cutting edge quality, but the shit we've endured this season tactically has let us down.

I think even Balotelli and Lambert could have solved some of our striking woes had they been used correctly, but again it falls on Rodgers not understanding how to get the best out of a lot of his squad.

But if we're going down their transfer in and out value only. Lucas and Henderson are 2 of our best players and personally I don't think their value to another team would be near £15mill. However to us, they are worth a lot of money. 

Some of the transfers we made will the highest that player will be bought for in their career. Is Lallana ever going to a bigger club? Or will he every be ""too good"" for Liverpool. Will Lovren? Probably not, Liverpool was meant to be their long run club and selling them for a profit was never meant to be the case. That's ideally the same with most players, why would we want to buy a young Markovic for £20mill get his transfer value to £40mill and then sell. That's the wrong mindset to have for a club that won't be able to just pull a £40mill pound signing. Hopefully we would rather keep the player. 

Spurs were in a similar position a few years ago. They had a young Bale and Modric and built a squad pretty much around both and sold for both for a lot of money. They then spent the money on the whole squad that needed improving (which was the same scenario for us last season) as they couldn't pull 1 or 2 world class players. Unfortunately (or fortunately) their expensive signings didn't perform. But the point is, they sold their best players for what was obviously a massive profit and over their purchased value. Then the money was spent poorly. We should be looking to keep the young players we have and look to make small changes to the squad. Mixing another 6 transfers in and 4 out will only dysfunction the squad. We have to realise not every player purchased is world class but we get rid of the very worst, keep the rest and work on getting the best out of them like what Rodgers has done for Suarez, Sturridge, Henderson, last years Stevie, Skrtel this year, Mignolet has turned a massive corner and Coutinho.

No simply speaking against it is not sedition. This explains the concept better than I can: ""Apostasy (in the modern world) means for someone to change their minds about religion in their mind. This is not what is punished under Irtidad laws. The Prophet Muhammed (saaw) knew who were the apostates and didn’t kill them. Apostates under an Islamic state is better TRANSLATED as ‘nifaq’. What the Irtidad laws punish is actions – like speech and proclamations which are understood to be seditious/renegade/treasonous in an Islamic State, or physical actions which are the same (like fighting, or helping enemies). Intellectual debate and criticism of Islam – BTW – is NOT viewed as seditious etc, since Muslims held many debates with people of different religions, during the many Caliphates. However, the best translation of how classical Islamic scholars understood what Irtidad is and represents, is ‘sedition’ and ‘treason’ – the latter of which potentially carries the death penalty in some states in the U.S. It’s time we end using victorian-era English translations for traditional Islamic concepts.""

You mentioned 8, 3 are currently injured and 2 were out for quite a while during and at the start of the season as well. It's a good core, but what is a good core going to do injured? Also, compare them to Arsenal and UTD. Who of our players completely outshines (in current ability not potential) from our team compared to theirs. A fit Sturridge goes in for Giroud, Coutinho vs Mata/Ozil? Current sterling (the one everyone is shitting on right now) vs Walcott/Sanchez. Ashley young has been good this year, but I would prefer Sterling. Our midfield got dicked by both Arsenal and Utd, one of which was at home. Skrtel and Sakho are both, IMO, better than any CB they UTD and Arsenal have to offer. 3 or 4/8 players would replace them, and you only mentioned our good ones. 

Hot prospects are great to have, but they don't get you top 4. I agree most players are being played out of position due to the formation. However, the formation gave us our best run and only realistic chance of top 4 this year. People are forgetting before christmas we were 9 points off of top 4. Coming up to our home match against UTD we were 5 off which would have closed to 2 from a win. Was he really going to change formation after we'd gone 11 without losing (correct me if I'm wrong).

Lambert was a backup, Balotelli hasn't worked out so far. I would like him to but we'll have to see next season. If you play a striker for half of a season and they score one goal, literally against the worst opposition available to play (Ludogorets) would you continue to play him? Sterling is now our 2nd highest goal scorer and he doesn't take any of our set pieces. 

Players were getting played out of positon due to our formation change working well for a couple of months and players were adapting. The best we saw from Markovic, Ibe, Coutinho, Skrtel, Lallana was through our formation change that none of our players would be used to. 3-5-2 will Not be our formation next season, we'll revert back to a 4-3-3 most likely and our players will play in their position. But when we played 4-4-2 diamond/4-2-3-1 at the start of the season (5 games in onwards), no one impressed and they all played in familiar roles. 

We do have good players, but solely blaming missing out on top because of Rodgers is naive. You're looking for a scapegoat.

There's two conclusions from it. Either that it doesn't matter because people are so fucked off with Westminster. Or it doesn't matter because independence is worth any cost.

This is just a blanket dismissal. No actual argument is made here. Naipaul's status as a novelist in no way detracts from the validity of his views (although his racism might). He is also quite renowned for his journalism. Polemical intent in a work of journalistic exploration is does not actually count against anyone. If anything, it is to his credit that he wears his politics on his sleeve, in case anyone is in doubt about the attitude of who they are reading.

&gt; He has no expertise in the field

An appeal to authority. Count me unimpressed.

&gt; Schimmel is an expert in the field , her work is peer reviewed and record.

More appeals to authority. I'm not familiar with Schimmel's work, so I'll have to withhold any serious judgement, but there is a notable faction of Western academics - like Juan Cole, John Esposito, and the late Montgomery Watt whose careers and output are funded by Islamic movements and who effectively are despised hirelings of Islamic supremacists paid to make apologies for Islam and its world-conquering madness. The list of accolades Schimmel has received from Islamic groups makes me very skeptical.

&gt; really terrible translations

More glib dismissal from you. I've heard this time and again in comments on articles where there is critical thought about Islam. How bad can the translations be? I've looked them up, and I've never found any deeply mistaken translations being circulated. Islamic groups of many kinds have very conveniently placed what *they* view as accurate translations in to English of the Koran, Hadith, the Sira, and tafsirs online, and they can be easily looked up. Nothing in his book indicates that he's looking at bad translations. That's just an argument that Islamic apologists trot out whenever any outsider nails them on their ferociously evil scriptures.

Lol. Said's lying work on Orientalism has been completely exploded by subsequent scholarship. The whole thesis is garbage from beginning to end, and the discourse that springs from it functions as a smokescreen for jihad.

I'm not only having Rodgers blamed, I'm not having only the players blamed, I'm not pinning it down to Sturridge because even when he came back he was underwhelming. It's a joint problem.

Firstly, having a fifth place squad on paper means fuck all. The league does not work that way. United, Arsenal and City all struggled for periods of the season and despite how poor we have been for the majority of the season, we still almost got top four. 

We had an opportunity from their failings, but due to how awful we've been, we didn't capitalize.

Secondly, the players aren't getting away scott free. Gerrard, Lovren, Balotelli, Sterling, Markovic, Allen, Moreno, Johnson etc etc. They all get grief for their performances. Tactically Rodgers has got it wrong numerous times this year, so like the players that perform badly, he's getting criticised too, much like people want players like Balotelli sold.

&gt;  It's a good core, but what is a good core going to do injured? Also, compare them to Arsenal and UTD. 

I'll happily play this game with you. Have you seen United's defense? Where are all these star players they signed for big money? That's right, they're on the bench with Ashley Young and Fellaini outplaying them. 

Our squad is as good as the United squad. De Gea has saved their ass from another dire season, like Suarez often kept our head above water. We do have the players to keep up with them, but we need to address some of our key areas.

They were nowhere near in touching distance of the 6th place let alone the top four. They have made a big step forward, and just looking at it in that manner is extremely short sighted.

We have played poor football because teams figured us out tactically. They exposed Gerrard for the first 3 months of the season and sat back in numbers, something Rodgers has never been able to figure out how to break down.

Teams know that if they defend in numbers, we will be utterly bamboozled in the final third. They know our frailties defensively, so they stick a runner on Gerrard, and run at our exposed defense, waiting for the inevitable mistake from one of them that will lead them to a goal. 

We play shit football, because Rodgers takes too long to adapt when teams start getting to grips with our tactics. It takes a few months of poor results before he changes it up and by then we've lost huge amounts of ground. 

Rodgers doesn't have 2 world class strikers to paper over his tactical failings this year. He's a great coach, but tactically, he's pretty bad.

Obviously. That means you should really keep your opinion on a comparison between Naipaul and her to yourself. 

&gt;Said's lying work on Orientalism

Not really, his work is controversial, but it's not been ""exploded"", unless you've been reading people like Daniel Pipes and Robert Spencer, who are in the minority and are really upset about his undermining of their favorite scholars. In fact Said's work is seen horrendously important for blowing the cobwebs off the fields it impacts and challenging ME scholars to come up with better narrative of what has happened. It's led to immensely important work that has re-examined the power relationship in the ME and the subsequent history of the ME. Everyone from Vali Nasr , all the way down to Wilfred Madelung owes something to him. That's a huge range of scholars over vast disciplines. 

&gt; they view as accurate translations in to English of the Koran, Hadith, the Sira, and tafsirs online, and they can be easily looked up. 

This Naipaul's work? He wouldn't know a good translation from a bad one, he doesn't speak Arabic. He doesn't understand classical Persian or Urdu for that matter - which most of the court documentation of South Asian was written in. Also he doesn't speak Hindi or read it, or Sanksrit, or Tamil, or Sinhalese - as he doesn't speak any South Asian languages.  

&gt;like Juan Cole, John Esposito, and the late Montgomery Watt whose careers and output are funded by Islamic movements

Monty Watt, an Islamist stooge? Alright which idiot on Jihadwatch made that nonsense up? BTW Monty Watt is exactly the kind of Orientalists that Said points out as having a flawed understanding or the ME. Monty Watt was influential on Hawting and Crone -moderns scholars have pretty much relegated all three of them being ""of their time"". 

At this stage you'll have realised you're talking to someone who know what they're talking about when it comes to the ME. Having lived, worked there and studied it.
