We still dont, for what it's worth. He's got a lot of followers believe that he's got some sort of philosophy. 

In truth, he doesnt. One day it's Dortmund, the next day is tiki taka, the third day it's Everton style, the fourth day it's Roma style strikerless.

In my case, a letter was all it took. I simply listed why I believed I'd been underpaid, cited the relevant employment law, requested payment, and sent the letter recorded delivery. I got a cheque exactly 30 days after I'd mailed my letter.  

As the company you worked for has an HR department, a copy of your letter should go to them as well. HR exist to ensure the company is acting within UK employment law.

&gt; **HONG KONG** residents can enjoy astoundingly fast broadband at an astoundingly low price. It became available last year, when a scrappy company called Hong Kong Broadband Network introduced a new option for its fiber-to-the-home service: a speed of **1,000 megabits a second** — known as a “gig” — for less than **$26 a month**.

4 years ago for about 17 quid.  Meanwhile:

&gt; SK Broadband will introduce its new **10 gigabit** per second Internet service at the Oct. 20 Plenipotentiary Conference of the International Telecommunications Union to be held at Busan’s BEXCO Center, in partnership with the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning and the National Information Society Agency.

We had a local catering contractor who provided food for meetings and events at the building, which included the most fantastic cakes. Anyway: after I helped repair her daughter's computer so she didn't lose the piece of coursework that was on it, I had the head of the caterers tip me off about overcatered government meetings so that I could creep down to the other side of the building and liberate uneaten food for me and my team, as the platters left the meeting rooms. It was glorious how many free lunches I got.

But something I noticed is that sometimes, as often as five or six times a year, this particular government department would organise an event for 40 to 100 people, cancel it, and *not tell the caterers*! Apparently their process for cancelling events didn't include ""tell the hired help"". So food for several dozen people would turn up and go completely to waste. Well... of it weren't for the fact the the vultures of my building would swoop in for a free feast, and none of those were so fast as my team, as I'd get tipped-off about the large order and the meeting's cancellation just as soon as the caterers knew and be first to get down there and loot free food for my team and I.

- don't try and ""do"" a British accent 

- don't carry a knife, knife laws are very tight here 

- tipping is nowhere near as prevalent, maybe 10% at a restaurant if the service is good and a few quid for taxi drivers &amp; barbers. 

- keep the volume down, some Americans can be LOUD

Leave your car at home,  the import costs are insane so unless it's your prized supercar then it's not worth it. Also yank cars tend to be heavy on petrol which is still quite expensive here.

**dont get stabbed**

Don't act like an American tourist and you'll be fine. We're not exactly hostile to Americans but you can be a bit full on and loud sometimes, especially when you're like the ""everything is awesome"" song from from the Lego movie in person. 

**cost**

Everything seems expensive because it kinda is although the living wage is higher here once you do a bit of conversion and not having to buy things like heathcare every month is awesome. For example a loaf of bread here is the equivalent of $1.54

Also land is a lot more expensive.  We don't really have Americanised style housing with huge open plan downstairs and gigantic square footage

I think regarding business/personal goals, we're at cross purposes. I am talking personal goals as in my hobbies. I see them as utterly unrelated to work in every way and wouldn't associate achieving something to do with a hobby with what I've done in work. I think, from what you're saying, that you see business as enabling someone to achieve a particular lifestyle through rewards/funding/pay/bonuses etc.  

Of course businesses are there to make money - my partner is self employed as a contractor now, I mentioned him elsewhere in this thread, and while he loves what he does, he doesn't do it for pennies. But he didn't *just* go into business to become a fatcat contractor and leech all he could out of clients. As I've said elsewhere, there's a lot of reward to be reaped from also doing something that you love, which may well offset the fact that you might not immediately get a large holiday allowance or top level salary.

&gt; Anyone else reminded of Kahn when watching Mignolet?
For me Kahn was the greatest of all time, if Mig could get anywhere near that level, we'd have one hell of a keeper.

&gt; Kind of reminds of Neuer

&gt; I would actually take Mignolet over Neuer myself to be honest. Maybe I'm biased though since I watched him let in several weak goals in two games against Sweden in the WC qualifiers (4-4 and 5-3). He's not as impregnable as he's made out to be imo, he's just usually solid in the sense that he makes the saves he has to. Mignolet on the other hand has made some unbelievable saves this season, and has improved his catching and passing considerably as well. You think back to some of the key saves he made that many keepers might have struggled with and the list is pretty much endless

and from there on is where I interfere and subsequently get banned.

&gt;""If you cant get a job in 6 months, you are either not trying hard enough or you lack any employable skills (in which case, you should spend the 6 months enrolling in education/courses to improve your prospects).""

You sound a little divorced from reality here. Considering there's often about 100 people applying for one position, and 99 people therefore won't get it, so the likelihood is that it could take up to 6 months or more to get a job. Also, consider that there is a lot of prejudice that goes on in the workplace during the application process - having a ""foreign name"", being a woman, being young, or being too old can negatively affect your application sometimes. My mum was in middle-management roles for around 25 years, and when she was made redundant she took over a year just to find a part-time job. She was 55 and I'm guessing employers couldn't be bothered to invest in her because of her age, even though she had great references, loads of skills and experience and was charismatic in interviews (She had to attend these patronising ""CV writing workshops"" to get her JSA, this is a woman who had actually TAUGHT people how to write CVs and run a hospital department). Her case isn't unique, either.

And those people who ""lack employable skills"" - yes, they should be in training. But unfortunately - I don't know if you've maybe been financed by mummy and daddy your whole life or you've been fortunate enough to get a job straight after school - training and education are not paid for by the state.

1. Unless you're a rich, white, man, the chances are, someone died or went to prison for YOUR right to help decide who runs your country. So it must be important, right? Nothing's changed, the political system was still as corrupt then as it is now (if not slightly more) and people still thought it was important then. 

2. Unless absolutely everyone decides not to vote and overthrows parliamentary democracy within the next two months (HA.), abstaining from voting is completely useless, and you have much less chance of changing things by not voting than by voting.

3. Even if the current political system is fucked up and you feel like your vote is useless, the problem is that ALL THE AWFUL PEOPLE WILL STILL VOTE, which can only end badly. You can't stop them from voting for awful parties but you can cancel out their votes by getting off your arse.

Was there supposed to a new office in Liverpool? Yes, a development, design and marketing office. Not a new HQ as this article states. I was told about the office plans last month in our monthly meeting with the UK team in London. They were working with our finances here in Dublin to secure the land and development costs. When we buy land or property we never tell the owners who exactly is buying the land because they always bump the prices up when they find out Google is involved. Anyhow the owner of this plot of land near the Albert Dock found out a member of the finance team was a Google employee based in Dublin so he ended asking for 4 times what the land was worth. We pulled out of the deal and the land owner ended up selling to a development project building student accommodation.

Just like this article, people made massive assumptions, I didn't promise anyone a career I just said keep an eye out on our careers page. I wasn't informed myself that this project had stalled until Wednesday when a colleague found my post here and told me the new office was called off weeks ago.

I apologise for spreading misinformation as it was never my intention to do so. There are still plans to build a new office on Merseyside but in all likelihood it wont be until next year now.

There are also other effects not taken into account, like high covariance between events. The more people from abroad that we encourage to come here for legitimate purposes also increases the amount that come here to commit crime, that come here to scrounge (NOTE a hell of a lot less do this than the Daily Mail would have you believe, but it still must be taken into account to decide what the cost of immigration is), and that wish to immigrate here with their entire family and entourage with no skills that we need.

Despite the above, i'm actually for immigration. A system that doesn't have movement of people will eventually stagnate, but we need a system where we *control* this flow.

TLDR; No thanks.  Leave the Internet alone.

If the government wants to pay for fibre to the home, or WiFi spots in the capital -- nothing stops it -- it doesn't require any change of category for the internet whatsoever.  One might almost think that there is some other motive for wanting to introduce laws relating to the Internet.

Also: once government gets involved, the works get gummed up.  Imagine what it would be like trying to change from dial up to ADSL or ADSL to ADSL2 or ADSL2 to fibre if the government were in charge of the process.  Also, there are new technologies always on the horizon -- LoRa is coming, and is very exciting for forming a low-speed mesh for Internet-of-things devices -- the government with its everything-is-a-nail approach to hammering laws in, could easily outlaw new technologies because they didn't include a necessary mention of the technology that didn't exist when the ""Public Internet Provision Act 2016"" was written.

&gt; We Already Have Net Neutrality.

So their argument against net neutrality starts with ""we don't need it, because we have it already!""


&gt; Some Companies Take Up More Bandwidth Than Others. 

True, and that bandwidth is paid for by the user. Enforcing net neutrality is about preventing ISPs from double-dipping by charge their customers for access to the internet, then extorting content providers for ""preferred access"" to their customers.

Of course this problem will be solved when ""market choices take place"". Unfortunately that choice is between provider A that offers good general speed, but YouTube access that buffers for half an hour before playing, or provider B that offers poor general speed (BBC News takes 1 minute to load per page) but YouTube is super speedy. But choice! Choice! Choice between a turd and a shit.


&gt; The Government Still Allows Discrimination In Traffic

So now the problem with net neutrality is that it doesn't go far enough? 


&gt; Barriers to Entry Are Created

Quit the opposite. Barriers to entry are created by existing providers making exclusive (monopolistic) ""preferred access"" deals with content providers. This prevents new entries to the market from offering equivalent access to the internet, regardless of their improvements in service or technology.


&gt; Internet Taxes Could Happen

Lots of things *could* happen. They could also not happen.


&gt; Content Restrictions From The Government

Things like that one, which has nothing to do with net neutrality whatsoever. They couldn't even make it to *seven* imaginary reasons why net neutrality is a bad idea.

Earning 0.5% on 5k saved away and paying at best 4-5% on a loan of 5k makes no sense? its costing you £100's per year just to service this debt,  definitely clear the debt. Also means when you come to get a mortgage app they don't have a debt already to include on the application.

Aim to be really strict and attempt a 15 or even 20% deposit, that way even if you come up short you could still end up with 13/17% which is far more helpful than 10%

You want to comfortable afford your first home not only just afford it, because it is a long commitment and you are buying a house when interest rates are at the lowest they have ever been. Take advantage of the property ladder now, but be aware of potential rises, The more comfortable your payment and deposit is. The more relaxing it will be in the long run.

Ings may or may not come, as recent rumours seem to be suggesting that he will go to real sociedad. 

So with that said, come the start of next season Lambert will probably still be our 3rd best striker (assuming we keep balotelli). 

Origi could come in ahead of him, but Brendan has not worked with him and may need time to figure out his best position/how to play him, if he has been playing as a wide forward up until now (I don't watch lille, but thats what people seem to be saying). 

Possibly the same story with Ings, except nobody knows whether he will be a Liverpool player come the start of next season or not. 

Either way, with how little we would get for selling him and with how little his wages are presumed to be (never heard anybody complaining about his wages), I don't think it makes any sense to get rid of him.

&gt; The second action, this at the Federal level, is what really cements it for me.  Many will have heard of the ongoing Network Neutrality / Title-II legislation being worked on by Congress and the FCC.  On the face of it, it’s spun as ‘good for Internet Freedom’ and ‘levels the playing field’.  The reality of it, is reclassification of ALL US broadband providers as Public Utilities at the Federal level.
&gt; 
&gt; So, a company I and my friends built from scratch, that doesn’t receive public subsidies or use public rights of way, will become public property.  The American population has been groomed to such a level of entitlement that they see Internet service as a human right, like air or water.  They feel they have a right to what I provide, a right to my labor, and the government is only too happy to oblige.

&gt;Lumbering alongside the hedge fund managers into the Tories' Black and White Election Fundraising Ball last week was Paul Staines, boss of the Guido Fawkes blog which purports to be the voice of ""anti-politics"".
&gt;
&gt; Stains even bid (unsuccessfully) for a shoe-shopping trip with Theresa May; it was left to website *Buzzfeed* to reveal what was on offer, thanks to a bit of good old-fashioned journalism (sending a hack to stand outside in the cold until he found a departing guest drunk enough to hand over the catalogue).
&gt;
&gt; It is far from the first time Staines has partied with the bash. Last October he hosted a tenth anniversary party for his blog which was attended by a number of Conservative cabinet minsters and London mayor Boris Johnson, and for which David Cameron provided a video tribute. Staines also joined a lavish Tory fundraiser last year at Old Billingsgate Market. Tory organisers had taken great pains to keep the guest list secret and, in a note to helpers, banned all reporters and photographers except one: only the tamed Staines could join the party.
&gt;
&gt;What was it Staines told Lord Justice Leveson's inquiry about the Westminster lobby system to which he claimed to offer an alternative? Ah yes, that it was ""an unhealthy and closed system lacking in transparency conducted behind closed doors … A client media has developed whereby journalists who recycle the party line are encouraged and rewarded with titbits and exclusives.""",null,0,null,1424345615,null,0,false,0,coq8kr7,null,t3_2wf1n6,null,t1_coq8kr7,null,t3_2wf1n6,null,null,null,1424673948,null,178,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,178,null

null,false,iferousmonster,null,null,null,"I completed on a house purchase on Monday.  Not my first house, but the first on my own (previous house was owned with my ex).


I found a local mortgage broker online (through unbiased) - they didn't charge a fee, and were whole of market.  They got paid comission by the mortgage provider, but were very clear about it and I didn't ever feel that comission amounts were influencing the advice I was given.  If you have any marks on your credit record (defaults, etc), or are looking for a high LTV ratio, or to borrow the maximum for your salary, I'd definitely recommend a mortgage broker.  They'll know which mortgage providers are picky in which areas, and so who is most likely to accept you.  My case was relatively straight forward, and I'm sure I could have gone direct to a bank for the mortgage, but the whole thing was stressful enough I was glad that I could just sort of hand off responsibility for sorting the mortgage over to someone else.


Fees add up - you need money for stamp duty, solicitors fees, mortgage fees, moving costs, etc.  They eat away at the deposit money until suddenly you find you have less than you thought.  Plus, what happens if you've put all your money into the deposit, and two weeks after moving in the boiler packs it in.  Its now your responsibility to fix it.  So keeping back a small emergency fund is almost essential.


In terms of the actual purchasing process, I wish I had chased my solicitor more regularly.  I just sort of trusted that they would do what was needed, which they did, but slowly.  Only once I started chasing up progress every couple of days did things actually move along a bit faster.  I'd recommend using a local solicitor.   Some of the big online ones are probably cheaper, but you don't normally have a single person to deal with, plus I've heard that if anything out of the ordinary comes up during conveyancing, they can be a bit rubbish at handling it.  The advantage of using someone local is that if something all of a sudden becomes urgent, you can get to them to pick up / drop off documents, without introducing postal delays.  One of the people higher up the chain in my purchase was threatening to pull out if we didn't exchange the next day.  I was able to drive to my solictor, pick up the contract and documentation to read, take it away and review it, then sign and drop everything off the same day.  If we'd had to rely on post it would have taken at least an extra couple of days.


I'd also suggest you establish your budget before you start looking for places.  Do a thorough assessment of finances to establish what you can afford as a monthly payment on a mortgage.  Then have a look at how much banks will lend you.  Once you know how much you can buy for, then start looking.  There's nothing worse than finding a property that you love that you can't afford.  You will inevitability compare everything you can afford to this other house, and find fault, and end up not really liking the property you end up buying.  Or you'll convince yourself that you can stretch your budget to make the more expensive place affordable, and regret it later when you have no life because you're spending so much on your mortgage payments that you can't afford to do things you'd like to.",null,0,null,1424346289,null,0,false,0,coq8pzd,null,t3_2w7r59,null,t1_coq8pzd,null,t3_2w7r59,null,null,null,1424674016,null,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2,null

There is no evidence at all that consumers are having their internet throttled based on target host (I think there was one case of ComCast in the US trying this and the outcry from their customers got it reversed quickly -- and their reputation still hasn't recovered).  This is a law for a problem that doesn't exist.  So you should ask yourself why they are (or want to) enacting it?

Net neutrality basically says: you, owner of that piece of wire, that router, and that computer cannot do what you want with them.  If it's my wire, then why shouldn't I be allowed to charge per packet, or per target or whether there is an even number of bytes in it?  I doubt it would make my service very popular, and I would find my competitors beating me -- which is the correct way to deal with neutrality.

Would you carry on with an ISP that charged extra for looking at iPlayer?  No, so you'd get a neutral net without a law.

Let's take iPlayer as an example.  Let's say my ISP notices that a vast quantity of their traffic is for iPlayer.  They take action by setting up a huge iPlayer cache inside their network -- any requests to iPlayer are now like lightening for their customers (who are therefore happy) and cost the ISP very little external bandwidth.  Would that violate a net neutrality law because why should iPlayer get better treatment than Netflix?  Let's say then Netflix pay ISPs to do exactly that, making their service look better?  Would that violate net neutrality?  Probably.  So it won't happen.

So they leave and we have to draft in foreign replacements like Sagna who can accept a second choice position without disrupting the team.

Quite ironic that Richards should point out Jovetic's exclusion from the squad when had Micah stayed Sagna would not be taking up that last space on the roster and we would have had room for Stevan.

Richards at Florentina has 12 appearances, 6 in the league.
Sagna at City has 11 appearances, 6 in the league.

Hopefully we can soon start seeing some homegrown players come through the academy.

At 25 it was not only about making a job choice, but also consideration about a ‘career’. Unfortunately, I had no idea what the hell I was doing with my life, and I just really hated the concept of having to work in a job I had no desire to do for 40 hours per week.  

Whilst I found hundreds of vacancies available, a percentage required specific skills/qualifications so that automatically left me with a smaller pool to choose from. From what was available, it was a case of, well although I could do this, do I really want to be doing as my chosen profession? 

Although I don’t have firsthand experience in the existing market, I wonder do you? I question whether the vast majority of jobs available actually have 100 applicants per vacancy like you say, and language such as:
 
""entire generation of starving/home less people""
 
 is a rather far fetched consequence of this proposal.  

You say that: ""inequality is the highest in Western Europe""

How does the UK compare with the entire world in terms of overall living standards? Why do hundreds of thousands of people from across the EU and rest of the world emigrate to the UK each year?

A lot of it stems from my dad - I found him dead at his home, collapsed between a sofa and a chair, phone just out of reach, less than 24 hours after I last saw him alive and it completely changed my outlook on life in a heartbeat. I'm not a religious person, don't believe in any sort of after-life, and am haunted by the fact that there were probably things I could have done that would have stopped my dad dying and joining the ever-lasting nothingness that I believe occurs when you die. I don't want to go into what killed my dad, but all I'll say is, I most likely could have stopped him from dying, at least for a while, and long enough to say goodbye and ensure my younger brother could have too.

I suffer from PTSD and on/off depression. Even though it has been well over a year since my dad passed away, I still struggle with nightmares and regret. I pretty much lost any fear of death I may have held before that day, and these days feel like I can't be bothered with life. It seems pointless, considering that we could all drop off the coil at any time leaving just more misery and heartbreak. 

I put on a happy face, I shield others from what goes on in my head because I've got a partner to support, a brother to guide. I'm financially very stable, in my mid-twenties, have a house, a reasonably well-performing business, a sports car, but I just feel like a shell plodding along for the sake of it.

&gt; Cell phones

Phones are illegal in prisons.

All the mobile phone companies are equally crap. Just go with whichever one has the best coverage of stuff you care about (voice or data) in areas you care about. Under no circumstances should you get a phone from a phone company. Instead, just make sure that your current phone is unlocked, bring it with you, and get a SIM-only monthly contract. Try several different providers to see which is best in your area and once you've found that out, upgrade to a SIM-only yearly contract. Of course, if you were suckered into buying a phone that uses weird proprietary radio stuff, then you'll need to buy a new one, but even then you should buy it unlocked from Apple and not from a phone company.",null,0,null,1424350144,null,0,false,0,coq9neh,null,t3_2we5s5,null,t1_coq9neh,null,t3_2we5s5,null,null,null,1424674449,null,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1,null

I moved from the Midlands to Manchester about 5 years ago, prior to that I used to visit her regularly as she lived all of five minutes from my home - just spending time with her and helping with chores as she lived alone and suffered with Lupus (degenerative blood disorder). Long story short, I was meant to visit her one week, but I couldn't attend due to work load... so we agreed to delay a week, that week came and she passed away with a complication, she had tried to call for help but physically couldn't - my younger brother went to check on her and found her dead. 

I went through a process similar to yourself after this - I felt like if I'd just parked my work I could of just travelled down for the weekend that things could of been different; blaming myself for being selfish - I still think about it to this day. However, what I did came to realise in time is that going over things in retrospect I found is a very dangerous road, particularly with events like this. There's an infinite amount of things / variables that could of been different and you can get trapped in this process, a cycle of self-blaming and revisiting events that ultimately you have no control over.  

As my first response indicates I share the same view, when we eventually perish that's the end of the ride and I also hold no religious beliefs - so I can't offer any words suggesting your father is in a better place now. 

On the other side of the fence, the brighter side I think, you sound very successful for your age and have a lot of responsibility. You should be very proud of what you have achieved, so relatively young. I would recommend you use this responsibility and success as strength to guide you through this tough time - you have everything to live for. 

Not sure if my words are of any use to you and I can't do anything to help with nightmares or depression, but again I will end that I hope you overcome this.

2. I believe the issue of defense will be one of the things discussed at the spring conference, so this policy will be scrutinised and fleshed out. At the moment the policy is pretty vague/misleading but one of the arguments I've seen put forward and agree with for example is that we do need a large navy as to defend our Island, but we don't need such a large air force or aircraft carriers as these are mainly used offensively (in this case the air-force was used defensively but if we were actually at risk of being bombed we could use anti-aircraft missiles to defend ourselves, we don't need large squadrons of fighter planes).

&gt; Competition can definitely lead to monopolies, when one side brings so much money into the game that wipes out the competition and raises the barrier to entry for further companies to compete.

There is always scope for competitors to come along (just look at IBM-&gt;Microsoft-&gt;Apple-&gt;Google in the list of ""monopoly"" companies that each created the conditions for their own successor).

The barriers to entry you speak of are almost universally legal; the government is responsible for creating those barriers (often at the behest of the winner).  I think you'd be hard pressed to find a monopoly that wasn't maintained by government (the technological ones I've mentioned being an exception, but then they've each lost their monopoly without government intervention, so perhaps they are perfect examples).

I also didn't say that monopolies were impossible, simply that competition is not what leads to them (if it were then monopolies would be inevitable whereever there is competition -- and that is not so).

We really need to improve our goalscoring still.  Defensively we've been much more solid, but we're still not scoring a lot.  Sturridge should help a lot once he's back to full match fitness, but he can't be the sole option.  Coutinho, Markovic, and Ibe need to chip in with more goals from the midfield and Balotelli really needs to roll on from finally breaking his league duck to start banging more in.

We have a very frustrating tendency to switch off for like 15-20 minute long periods too, which is really dangerous.  We've hung on just about lately, but the better teams will capitalize on this and punish us badly.

BR also isn't going a particularly great job of rotating some of our key players.  Coutinho now and Sterling before that have both had ridiculous extended runs in the team that really burned them out a little bit.  Coutinho was almost non-existent for large stretches in his last 2 games and looked noticably tired/not quite right.  He really should have been rested at the weekend and I don't think his involvement was necessary to beat Palace. We need him so badly now on Thursday and then again just days later against Soton, but I worry he won't have it in the tank to be his exceptional self for both or even really one of those matches.  We're very lucky that the fatigue on these two players hasn't resulted in a frustrating injury for at least one of them yet.  I know Sterling's situation was a little bit different because he was the only player playing well at that time and our other forward options just weren't cutting it, so that's a little trickier but we do have players available who can do a job for a match if needed IMO.

I'd like to pick up on this point specifically, as it's frequently complained about and the operating companies usually get the blame.

Trains can be late for a huge number of reasons, and very few of them are in train companies' hands.

Train companies don't deliberately ask trains to depart late, nor run slow along the way, because they get fined for late runners.

The delays generally come from things like infrastructure problems (cabling problems for example), late running of staff (traffic due to an accident), or worst of all, a previously late running train which knocks on and causes many problems as the day goes on including trains and staff out of place, and express trains stuck behind local trains meaning even more delays and even more knock ons, and so on and so on.",null,0,null,1424352022,null,0,false,0,coqa7pt,null,t3_2wbd8p,null,t1_coqa7pt,null,t1_copj09x,null,null,null,1424674712,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

To do that, you need not just the knowledge, but practice in *applying the knowledge* to problems.

Learning how to learn and take that approach now will benefit you for life far more than your GCSE grades ever will. and the only way to learn *that* is by doing it to develop techniques that work.

Surprisingly not everyone knows that, or necessarily has access to the hardware to enable you to do so, or the environment in which to do it.

Also some employers may well like the idea of a blank slate because you don't have to unteach them the bad habits they've picked up self-teaching.  Learning to write code is easy; learning to write good software as part of a time, not so much.  Someone who's spent a lot of time on hobby projects might actually be harder to introduce to a team than someone who's starting from scratch.

&gt; I wonder what projects work well with cheap inexperienced people on them rather than a bit more expensive people who would have more of a clue as to what they are doing

The whole point of apprenticeships (at least if they're done right, and whatever industry they're in) is that you're investing in the future.  An apprentice obviously isn't going to be as productive as a more experienced worker, and they're not supposed to be (which is one of the justifications for you being allowed to pay them less).  Nor, initially, are they likely to be left alone and expected to ""do the job"" in the way a full employee would be.

They are ""learning by doing"", alongside taking relevant formal education, working under close supervision which will naturally reduce as their skills are seen to improve.

It's also worth noting that most projects will have some percentage of ""grunt work"" or relatively simple discrete tasks which can be explained fairly easily, so it's usually possible to find some ""real work"" from the get go for anyone with half a brain.",null,0,null,1424353503,null,0,false,0,coqaqb7,null,t3_2wd6m1,null,t1_coqaqb7,null,t1_copsd6c,null,null,null,1424674953,null,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1,null

It is completely normal to try two or more prescription medications before settling on one that works for you. For example you might try adapalene without the benzoyl peroxide. Do also ensure you are not using any cosmetic topicals that clash with the Epiduo - certainly avoid exfoliation as your skin acclimatises to the retinoid, and any product that contains known irritants (eg. fragrance, drying alcohol, harsh anionic surfactants).

I can't think of a single business that operates this way nor does it seem rational to assume that. 

Yes Bayern have to travel to Ukraine and we have to play in Florence, but those are just single instances. What about the games where we've had to play in places like Tromso or Dagestan? And not only that but because there's more teams in the EL, we have to do comparatively more traveling than our CL counterparts. There's a serious difference between what we have to deal with in the EL, and what teams have to deal with in the CL.

Lastly FFP is a farce because it restricts those clubs with comparatively less resources from the kind of growth that the richer clubs enjoy. We can't go out and spend 40mil on a player without showing that we can collect that 40mil to begin with. Clubs like Chelsea with their cash injections that came before FFP, had the time to build their reputation, and with it attract comparatively greater support.

As far as I know she needs to provide the evidence for all damage, demonstrate it wasn't like that when you moved in and provide reasonable replacement/repair costs sourced via legitimate quotes from professionals that also don't assume a new for old replacement. She can't charge for a fancy new table if you broke a shitty old one worth next to nothing for example. She also needs to demonstrate that they are all beyond reasonable wear and tear and not her fault as a landlord for not ensuring the house is free of damp etc. 

Even then, if anything slips through this you need to make sure you request receipts of payment before you authorise deduction from your deposits to make sure she actually does it and to make sure she doesn't just get an inflated quote then do something on the cheap and charge you more. 

It sounds to me like things are probably much more in your favour by law currently and she is trying to get you to settle to something that wouldn't actually be fair. Contest everything and let the DPS advise and adjudicate if it comes to that. 

Edit: also it's common for contracts to require you pay for professional cleaning after tenancy. If so though you need them to provide evidence it was done before the start of tenancy otherwise contest it. If there is proof there though then don't bother trying to clean it yourself. Trust me I've tried, it won't be good enough for a professional inventory company and you'll end up paying anyway and have wasted hours and hours thinking you got it spotless but it's not. Just get a quote yourself and say you agree to that price and that company and check they are ok with it and then get them to arrange a date to do it. 

Second edit: I know you've requested it anyway but it's upto them to take the photos etc. It's normal to use a professional company to perform a full inventory pre and post inventory including detailed photos. If she didn't do that then she doesn't really have a leg to stand on from my previous experience.

It's just heavily geared towards a technical specialism. So if you go to the JCB Academy you're not going to have an option to take A-Level Drama. Your choices are going to be Maths, Business Studies, Physics, Chemistry, Design &amp; Technology, etc.

They're setting you up to either go and do an engineering degree or go into an Apprenticeship, so no, I don't think it would make you unprepared - quite the opposite. The JCB Academy for instance is supported by 4 different universities, aside from it's prime sponsor (JCB), along with Rolls Royce and Toyota. Those universities wouldn't be sponsoring it if they weren't intending for at least some of the students to head their way.

On the topic of homework, just because it's very practical doesn't mean it won't also cover the theory. You can't be an engineer without maths. It's not an apprenticeship - you're going to get all the usual classroom lessons.

Now whether they just have more class time (because you're in for a full working day rather than 9-3.30), or whether they assign ""homework"" but you then have ""self-study"" sessions to do that work in school time, I can't say.

I would also point out that there is a danger in equating left and right with, respectively, radicals and conservatives. Much Thatcherist rhetoric was aimed towards overturning the post-war social democratic consensus, but it had both its radical and conservative wings. Some wanted money to dominate (which I think arguably is what we've got), while others wanted a return to aristocratic divides. You might say these are different motives for the same ends, but I think the distinction is still valuable. It certainly explains why the libertarian wing could be married to the social conservative wing.

Arguably this means that the likes of Owen Jones can be described as reactionary, because they want to return to a society in which the welfare state plays a greater role such as we had in the 1950s. But they are also radicals because they want to overturn the political status quo, both in the sense of maintaining many of the social progress and extending the state's role into more areas of public and private life.

i agree, kolo imho should definitely be a part of the squad in some capacity. as a player coach would be ideal. so for next season, i would ideally still have: 

lovren, skrtel, sahko, wisdom, ilori and kolo as our cbs (can can play there too, and lloyd jones may be ready for the jump in some cup matches). 

rb: we will be guaranteed to only have flanno. i would love to keep manquillo, but he is almost certain to be recalled by athletico and glen is surely leaving. i would love to see us sign clyne or someone like that, but that's wishful thinking. 

lb: we have moreno and enrique. i think enrique has a big chance of leaving, leaving us with realistically moreno. 

i personally think our biggest transfer needs in the summer is to lock up fullbacks on either side (although wisdom and ilori can play that right back role and we could yet still retain glenjo and/or enrique), we need to sign at least one central midfielder (maybe two if milner is truly an option) and we need another keeper.

This was the first World Cup that I really started thoroughly enjoying soccer as a game itself. I'm usually very take it or leave it with sports, but I was way into this World Cup. And while England didn't do so hot, I found myself paying attention to Jagielka and Baines while watching them. So bear in mind, those were the first, not Timmy, lol. But I do love a man with a beard, so I became an obvious Tim Howard fan. Never really connected hugely with any specific Netherlands player. After the cup, I was all dejected because I had so much fun watching football. I find out the Premier League is aired in the US, so I look up the three guys whose names I actually know, and it's a bit of a shock that they all play for the same team.

From there they get processed and sorted out and every which package goes its way. That takes 2-3 days max. The longest time is that processing in Liverpool. Once it gets to DHL it'll be a day and a half in air, processed in another day. And sent out to you in the next. This is why people say that once they see it's done processing they are getting messages about courier pickup the next day. The hold up is that LFC needs x amount of orders in x region to send out their parcels. You can call DHL Express anytime and ask them anything, their number is on their site.

People who smoked regular tobacco for 50 years did so because it was readily available and cheap. And now they're clogging up wards and sucking up funds with their sputum coughing bronchitis and emphacema. It's been PROVEN that smoking rates have fallen in no small measure because tobacco products are so bloody expensive now.

Now consider cannabis, which is currently illegal, difficult to find, expensive and risky to obtain. What exactly do you think the occasional weekend toker will do once it's freely available and dirt cheap? Yup, he'll be smoking it every chance he gets.

While that's his choice, it's just yet another self-inflicted malaise that will cost the taxpayers a damn fortune 40 years down the line when it turns out habitual cannabis smoking IS also dangerous for you. Right now there are no definitive studies because people will not be 100% open about their habits when it comes to illegal substances.

Since Europa will always be on Thursday due to TV contracts negotiated with UEFA and the PL about what time slots to use, changing the schedule is a non-starter.

I think the answer is fewer matches and more regionalization.

The round of 32 (which doesn't exist on the CL side) adds two matches to a schedule already still potentially dealing with the LC and the FAC. Instead of adding the 8 losers from the CL, just send them home.

If you did that, you could organize the EL the same as the CL, except on Thursday nights: 8 groups of 4, 16 move to knockout rounds. To do so, you'd have to do more winnowing in prelim rounds because only 32 rather than 48 get into group, but I think that's a fair trade to make.

null,false,lancashire_lad,null,null,null,"&gt; for you a trade deal is just a series of 'features' that can be listed - but the practical reality is that these features have a huge impact on what will happen in terms of trade. the frictionless of the EU arrangements has a huge impact - EEA and bilateral arrangements are far more cumbersome in comparison.

Define what you man by the ""friction"" here. Are we talking about country of origin requirements? I accept that it an extra burden. But I just feel it is an additional burden on a declining market (and one in which we have a trade deficit) is a worthwhile price to pay for the reduced burden with high productivity and high growth economies. (And all of the many other advantages of leaving.)

&gt; if I've interviewed business owners about the problems they're facing, is that theory or practice?
&gt; its definitely theory - sorta odd that you don't know the difference. it kinda sounds academic - which would explain a lot. you aren't going to tell me this is your dissertation are you!? Or worse you work at a think tank? (fwiw I own a business that sells to over 50 countries around the world).

Well, it's not strictly speaking theory or practice. Theory is a self-contained intellectual framework that makes predictions. If you find out about practical difficulties second hand it's not your own practice and it's not an intellectual theory either. If you really must know I work in operations consultancy. Frankly, I find the whole arguments from authority ones tiring - everyone can pull a different card. There is a whole variety of knowledge that is helpful to understand a situation, and nobody has both the breadth and depth of experience to understand the whole thing from their own practice, even if the arrogant like to pretend otherwise. If an argument is right, it can be substantiated with logic and evidence without pulling credentials into it.

&gt; Anyway - are you carefully taking account of what they are saying? because the overwhelming majority of businesses want to stay in the EU (surveys usually report 80-85% in favour). 

Firstly, those surveys usually portray a simple choice between EU membership and nothing. If you asked businesses their preference between (a) EU membership and (b) a bilateral trade deal with the EU, Australia, Brazil and India, and NAFTA membership, then you would get a much closer result. Secondly, there's always a bias towards the status quo in such questions. If you ask people whether they would have their local park concreted over for a £1000 payment they will say no. If you ask people without a local park whether they would be willing to pay a £1000 fee to get a local park, they still say no. It's a well-documented effect.

&gt; Economists surveyed think just the referrendum itself is bad enough never mind Brexit. 

It's curious that you go from disdaining academic views as being out of touch with the practice, before using as evidence economist surveys, including economists that have never studied trade! Anyway, why don't you go back and look at how many economists supported the single currency before it's creation, and that has been a complete disaster. The right approach to getting to the right position isn't to interview a bunch of people and take the majority view. It's to talk to a lot of people, listen to as many arguments and counter-arguments as possible, the evidence for each of them, and to come to your own view.",null,0,null,1424358476,null,0,false,0,coqcx2k,null,t3_2w7qm9,null,t1_coqcx2k,null,t1_coqb0uh,null,null,null,1424675986,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Under 34's have by far and away the lowest turnout. Its no wonder they aren't listened to as much. Sure, there are fewer people in this category so they won't ever be the dominant force, but if they turned out in higher numbers and made their voice heard like that I'd guarantee they'd get more attention. As it is its a fact of democracy that politicians will pander to those that vote, not those that don't. 

By some crude calculations I've done mostly in my head, if u34's had the same voter turnout as the next lowest turnout age group (35-44s), they'd cast an extra ~2 million votes.

null,false,TheJonCave,null,null,null,"Johnny Comelately currently has £5,000 saved up, earning 2% interest after tax, in case of emergency, yet he also has £5,000 on credit cards at 18%. Thus while his savings are earning him £100 a year, his debts cost £900. Overall he is paying out £800 a year.

Now compare what happens if he pays off his debts with his savings, with not doing so:

Situation A:
No emergency happens

No change. Keeping both debts and savings costs Johnny £800 a year.

Pay off debts with savings. Johnny now neither earns nor pays any interest, thus is relatively £800 a year better off, and all the new cash he puts aside can go towards genuinely saving.

Situation B:
After a year he has to pay £5,000 for an emergency roof fix

No change. Johnny uses the savings for the emergency. This leaves him with no savings and £5,000 of credit card debt at 18%.

Pay off debts with savings. As Johnny has no savings, he has to borrow the £5,000 on his credit cards. This leaves him with no savings and £5,000 debt on his credit card at 18%.

In other words, Johnny is in exactly the same position in situation B, regardless of what he does. Yet before the emergency he was £800 a year better off by paying off his debts with his savings.

So overall, whether an emergency happens or not, the best result is to pay off your debts with your savings. The only time to beware of this is if you're not assured of being able to reborrow the cash.

An awful lot of people who consider themselves ""religious"" do not set foot in a church apart from weddings and funerals. I know dozens of these, perhaps you've never met any?

A quick google suggests about 10% of UK adults are regular churchgoers (seems on the high side to me but anyway...)

I got those offers because I drastically upped my game from GCSEs to A levels and my predicted grades plus my AS exam results and my teachers reference were all excellent (my personal statement was pretty great too IMO). The reason that I fucked up my interview at oxford was because I didn't revise enough for it, I wasn't properly immersed in engineering at that time and I struggled to answer questions that should have been quite easy if I had been following engineering and developed the mindset of an engineer/physicist. 

The points where I do agree are that you need to cultivate good working habits as well, you will not believe the step up from GCSE to A level and if you don't work considerably harder then you will fail. You also need to be able to develop these habits so that you can maintain them without the support network of your friends and family and even under immense stress because when you go to university you will again be shocked. To be honest the academic step from A levels to first year of uni is not nearly as big as from GCSEs to A levels but the difference is that you will have so much less support and be under so much more pressure it is very important to be self reliant and develop mental toughness.

null,false,collinsl02,null,null,null,"Don't bring a car - American cars are generally too large for our roads. It's also a hassle to import them, and you'd pay over the odds for insurance etc. Plus the steering wheel would be on the wrong side of the car for our roads (not the wrong side full stop). As for the driving, you just have to change gear with the other hand - the other controls are identical.

With regards to road rules - if you see a white sign with a black diagonal line through it, that means ""national speed limit"", which is 60mph on single carriageways, and 70mph on dual carriageways. The speed limit on motorways is 70mph unless a sign tells you otherwise. Other speed limits are indicated by white circular signs with a red border - all speeds are displayed in miles per hour. 

We use exclusively white lines in the centre of roads, but the markings are the same as in the USA - a dashed white line with long dashes means you can overtake, a solid line means no overtaking. On motorways/dual carriageways, a dashed white line with short dashes generally indicates a junction or an area where lanes are about to diverge - move to get in the right lane for your destination (as indicated by signs) and stay there. If it's a junction then turn off.

Single yellow lines on the side of a road mean you can only park for a limited time (generally indicated on a sign nearby) and double yellow lines mean no parking at all. Double red lines (used in London) mean no stopping at all (not a fire lane as they are in the USA) because these areas are high traffic.

Don't drive in anything marked up as a bus lane unless a sign says there are specific times you can drive there (generally at nights). 

Roundabouts (traffic circles) are something you might not be used to - give way to any vehicle to your right, and always go around clockwise. Pull out if you have a safe space to do so and if it is clear to the right. If there are lanes indicated for your exit stay in them, otherwise use the outside (left) lane if you are going less than halfway around the roundabout, and use the inside (right) lane if you are going more than half way around. 

Otherwise, have a read of [the Highway Code](https://www.gov.uk/browse/driving/highway-code) which should provide enough info for you direct from the UK government on driving in the UK.

++++++++++++++++++

Slang-wise, please don't try to use British slang - it makes Americans look stupid - the accent just isn't right and it looks like you're trying too hard to fit in.

Cost saving - bear in mind we don't have regional taxes, so the price you see on the shelf is what you will pay. For a lot of things we are more expensive than the USA, especially petrol (gas).

The major ~~three~~ EDIT: four  supermarkets here (Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons) ""price match"" each other - if they think (or if you find) that you could have brought your shopping for cheaper at one of the other stores they price match, they will give you a voucher for the difference. 

Otherwise, look out for deals on things. If you really want to save or are very pushed, you could shop at a pound-saver type store (99 cent store equivalent), or for an in-between option you have Lidl or Aldi.

Roads - don't bring a car over, it would be very expensive to ship so you are better off getting one temporarily here or just use public transport. It is normal for a lot of people not to have a car at all depending on where you are. We drive on the left, it is easy to get used to if the road is laid out that way and the steering wheel is on the correct side. Roundabouts are easy, just give way to traffic from the right.

Things may seem more expensive as the pound is stronger than the dollar. But at least we don't tend to tip and the tax is all included on the price.

SPF refers to UVB only, it is not necessarily broad spectrum (meaning UVA as well) which is essential with all prescription retinoids. Micronised zinc oxide is broad spectrum and much better for irritated skin than chemical agents, the maximum without risking a white case is ~19% which is ~SPF 30 so sufficient for normal UK exposure when using a topical retinoid (SPF 15 is the recommended minimum without photosensitising medication).

Also it is not wise to rely on make up: firstly protection is not cumulative so you don't get more protection by using two products containing sunscreen agents, secondly you are unlikely to apply enough liquid foundation or powder make up to get the stated protection (half teaspoon for face and neck). Unfortunately half the amount does not equal half the protection - more like a quarter or a third - so if a product claims SPF 15 (often are in the UK) you would be massively underprotected.

Lastly ensure you are eating plenty of oily fish (experts recommend up to four servings a week) for the bioavailable vitamin D and omega-3s.

Karlsen: Just six weeks into the New Year and the Spurs forward has already found the net against Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool -- a great satisfaction for a player who spent a great part of 2014 trying to prove his doubters wrong. Often ridiculed for his unorthodox style of play -- depending more on effort, enthusiasm, intensity and opportunism rather than silky skills -- Kane is a healthy reminder that perseverance never goes out of fashion. Time will tell just how far the England U21 striker can go -- barring injuries a call-up to the senior national side is imminent -- but on the evidence of his rapid development over the past year, all the signs point to Kane becoming a regular double-digit scorer in the Premier League.

Yes. I think it would have been better if the site had picked, I don't know, 6 issues under each topic area and given each party a very constrained form to fill in for each topic area where they can select words from a drop-down list.

For example, these sentences might be something like:

* This party **(supports/opposes)** using private firms within the NHS to supply some medical services.

* This party will **(increase/decrease)** powers of local councils to oversee school standards.

* This party believes the cap on benefits should be **(scrapped/decreased/maintained at the current level/increased)**.

* This party **(supports/opposes)** a referendum on EU membership and if a referendum were to take place would encourage voters to vote to **(stay in the EU/leave the EU)**.

Nowhere did I say the season was shattered. What I am saying is that the EL has more of an effect for us than the CL has on teams in the prem that are in it. Whether it's distances traveled, conditions faced or the number of games played, the EL unequivocally has an impact on our performance.

Again I'm not saying anything about a conspiracy. All I'm saying is that the FFP is not the shining light you seem to think it is. Your questioning what they stand to gain from Abramovich and the UAE does nothing to take away the fact that the from the time Chelsea was bought, to the time FFP was actually implemented was too far apart for a body that is charged with making competition fair.

As for saying that our two best seasons in the PL era were seasons where we played in the EL, I can also counter that the level of competition we faced in addition to the players we had made the difference. Our best season was also the season when Bale emerged to be the talent that he was. VdV and Modric were good, but they were not match-winners the way Bale was for us. Context matters.

Now arguments aside - I would personally love for us to win the EL.

For example, in my family, my late Great Grandfather and Great Grandmother *both* went to art school. It was a pretty big deal at the time, (even more so that my *Great Grand Mother* was attending, women just didn't get into these things as much) but it was the fact they had applied after a few years of part-time courses before and after the war. Neither of them had *any* qualifications from school and they both moved on to different completely different careers (medical et al) after re-training later in life. Simply put, ""O levels"" didn't come in until the 1950's, but the training in new fields was available to a wider range of people. 

Flash forward a few years to my maternal and paternal Grandfathers, both born in the post-war baby boom. My paternal Grandfather attended the regular school system, and got his O levels (he is slightly younger than my maternal Grandfather). My maternal Grandfather however, did not attend any school, achieved no formal qualifications, took up a job for a short while and joined the Royal Navy.  

The interesting part was that, they both did very well in their careers. The Grandfather that attended school attained his doctorate in Engineering and was a prof at a large UK University (who actually wrote a book on judging levels of academic achievement interestingly) and the other that had joined the Royal Navy? He also attained his Phd in photographing medical specimens, pioneered some techniques that lay the basis for modern methods and taught also at a large UK University.

The point was that as there was no real system until the 1950's of measuring your Primary education and so Higher education was a case of ""sink or swim"" - that you could or you couldn't complete the course. Much like any career - do your job or loose out.

In my case, I struggled to get passes on my own GCSE's, I did work extremely hard and did indeed pass, but I only struggled because of my learning difficulties. After which, I found that there weren't many pressures on me to try and better these results because I would ""just end up doing something vocational anyway"".


^^Im ^^not ^^bitter

Despite school and college? Honestly, I found that GCSE's were mostly for college, and college qualifications are for University. Which in the end I only got in because of clearing. 

In short, GCSE's are a formality, a hoop to jump through - but doing well in them gets you somewhere good. Stick it out, play the game and do well at it before someone else points out you have no idea what you're doing. 

Its not what you get as a grade so much in school, its what you do with it. How you let it effect you.

Anyway that's my story and experience with things. It doesn't define the larger picture of the UK's education experience as a whole anyway. ",null,0,null,1424363530,null,0,false,0,coqfsb8,null,t3_2wfdv3,null,t1_coqfsb8,null,t3_2wfdv3,null,null,null,1424677324,null,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1,null

Don't take jokes about the US personally. Light self-depreciation about being a Yank in a making-friends context gets you pretty far over here. 

Stop thinking about money in dollars. Seriously, just stop. You'll drive yourself mad. Otherwise you'll try to cut corners on basic necessities/brands/etc and end up with complete shit that you have to buy again later. Do stock up on clothes while you're in the US though, it's better value for money.

Randomers will talk to you just because you're American. Try not to go into too much detail with any of your answers. Sometimes, the best thing to do in a situation is pretend to be mute - particularly if you feel your nationality might bring undue attention to yourself. This bit of advice is more pertinent on nights out when people are drunk and rambunctious, though.

And lastly: Own your Americanness. Don't try to be British, you never will be. My friends in college eventually made me an American Ignorance card that I could play to opt out of conversations I knew nothing about. You'll become somebody's Token American Friend without too much trouble.

On the surface they sound like something an uncompassionate, sheltered simpleton would describe as ""common sense"" and it's only when you spend more than 2 seconds thinking about them you realise the terrible implications.

For example:

Replace the Human Rights act with a British Bill of Rights

*Common sense prevails well done Nigel*

Interests of law abiding citizens over those of criminals

*Keep talking Nigel fapfapfapfap*

**OH WAIT SHIT** so that means that without saying everone has equal rights then ""human rights"" now only apply to who the government says they should, i.e. non-criminals, and it's the government that writes the laws that determine who is a criminal and who isn't. 

So basically the government can arbitrarily decide who the bill of rights applies to and who it doesn't apply to thus making the whole thing meaningless.

null,false,NEWSBOT3,cnty-uk,Londontown,null,"[this wiki page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_differences_in_suicide) has a lot of info on it. 

&gt; The reported difference in suicide rates for males and females is partially a result of the methods used by each gender. Although females attempt suicide at a higher rate, they are more likely to use methods that are less immediately lethal. Males frequently complete suicide via high mortality actions such as hanging, carbon-monoxide poisoning, and firearms. This is in contrast to females, who tend to rely on drug overdosing.[16] While overdosing can be deadly, it is less immediate and therefore more likely to be caught before death occurs. In Europe, where the gender discrepancy is the greatest, a study found that the most frequent method of suicide among both genders was hanging, however the use of hanging was much higher in males (54.3%) than in females (35.6%). The same study found that the second most common methods were firearms for men and poisoning for women.[17]

&gt;Methods of suicide are frequently correlated both with traditional gender roles and availability of different methods. Men are more likely than women to both use and own firearms, which could account for the higher rates of firearm death among males. In nations where firearms have been banned, there is a drop in male suicides via gun but no change in females.[11] Females may tend towards less lethal methods of suicide because of gender-based ideas about attractiveness.[11][16]

Insofar as a backstory for Susan and the Doctor had been prepared, they were the last survivors of a war (sound familiar?) in the future - around the 50th century, who were now looking for somewhere more peaceful to settle. They were intended to be Human.

You're right that ""man up"" is far too common a sentiment. Although women do get told to stop being ""manly"" or to be more feminine, it's never really said in the same overt but completely blasé way that ""man up"" is. Where women are often policed subtly, men are policed very overtly.

I've always been quite a blokey girl, and over the years it's resulted in me being one of the only people that many guys felt they could open up to. I know that men find it hard to open up both men and women because they feel they need to be manly in front of both, but perhaps I hit some sort of midground that made it easier. Or perhaps seeing me toss my gender rules out of the window helped them to feel more comfortable doing the same. 

Whatever the reason, I learnt very early on that many, many boys and men are much more emotional than people might originally have thought.

As for the tank, that just gave me an idea. Originally, I hadn't thought about that and just figured I'd have something to change its colour to match. But instead, I think there's a loophole to be exploited here. 

The law with the vinyl wraps and resprays is that a full colour change has to be declared. But partial colour changes are exempt from that rule. What does that mean? Well, if I leave the tank in its original colour, I shouldn't need to declare it. 

Now, for aesthetic concerns, if I got bike that a neutral colour (probably black), I could quite comfortably leave the tank and the belly pan black, and change the rest of the fairings to any colour of my choosing that matches nicely with black (most of them do). 

I saw on another forum that someone had their car colour registered as ""red/multi"" when they had multiple colours, meaning I could potentially register it as black/multi or white/multi and be covered regardless of what colour the rest of the body is. 

Now, insurance. This is the tricky part. If the ""black/multi"" option works, then that would be best solution. Alternatively, I'd have to declare the modification. I've not dealt with insurers so this is just hopeful foreplanning, but I'd expect that the modification would be declared as the part of the vehicle. For example, if you have an aftermarket exhaust, you'd tell them the make and model. If I was to buy all my fairings from the same manufacturer, the model would be the same, regardless of the colour. The manufacturer's SKUs may vary per colour, but the model should still be the same. I know it's all conjecture, and I could be completely wrong and the only way to find out would be to ask the relevant insurer, but it's nice to have some sort of plan.

Another example that has sprung to mind is sex and sexuality. This is not to criticise my own partners; people as individuals are diverse and the girls I've been with have generally been really cool.
But there is an attitude I feel that men are 'up for it' at all times, and if they can't perform it's a failing as a man, whereas female sexuality is portrayed and accepted as complex and nuanced and requires care and attention. I guess that is an assumption on both genders, but I think it is more accommodating to diversity and respecting individuality to see people's sex drives as, well, diverse and nuanced (as female's are often portrayed) rather than a blunt instrument (as men's are often portrayed).

Anyway. I'm someone who can't bring myself to buy pink stuff for my newborn niece. I hate forcing labels and roles on people and get depressed when I think about how shitty our society is in doing that; from birth, even the name we assign someone usually tells them their gender, and the roles start being forced on from there. I just feel society is currently much more sensitive, aware of and trying to counter those forced female roles, at the expense of the equivalent male roles.

Another example is dating: the assumed 'superior' form of dating feels to me a rather female-centric view of a long-term, monogomous relationship. Other forms of relationship are looked down upon in our media and by our politicians as inferior. I have a problem with society saying what sort of adult, consensual relationship is right and wrong; and while everyone is different, again from my anecdotal experience girls are generally more in favour of the long-term monogamous relationship vs the guys who, if they could, would have multiple shorter term relationships; or a more casual friends-with-benefits situation; or at least are not so fixed on finding that long-term monogamy. That's cool - but I don't like being told which way is the right way of doing things. This is another example of what I mean by feeling that society has become 'overly feminised'.

Again, as individuals, I've met a lot of cool girls (and guys), so I am not criticising individuals, but rather a general social trend.",null,0,null,1424367854,null,0,1424368330,0,coqijl3,null,t3_2wf1tk,null,t1_coqijl3,null,t1_coqi08z,null,null,null,1424678610,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

Look at Colorado, read a while back that the state might be obliged to pay some of the tax revenue back to citizens (I think that legislation was a check on citizens being over taxed, clearly outdated or misapplied in this situation).

Only thing that i've found that's weirded out people is saying 'allright?' as a greeting. We don't think anything's wrong with you, it's just being friendly. Also, bear in mind slang and terms often vary a bit over the country, and we're not all posh twats.

Roads: English cars are right hand drive for the most part - but aside from that I wouldn't know much about driving as I can't.

Footy: For one, it's the premier league. Also, go support Cheltenam. It's cheaper, frendlier, and in my opinion, more fun to support a shite team. Either that or support the team that your friends like, or something. Bear in mind we tend to feverently support our teams and our often born into supporting one, so it's seen as bad taste to just pick the best team, along with other reasons.

- Culture - We're a friendly bunch, but this country is quite reserved, and you shouldn't just go around chatting to strangers unless you're maybe at a club or something, and especially not on public transport. We are also occasionally very sarcastic, and we take the piss a lot. You'll probably get taken the piss out of for being american a few times, but it's probably in jest and dont take it to heart. Unless they're cunts.

Cost Saving: Costs include taxes in this country in 99% of situations, so don't worry about that, i'd also suggest mostly shopping online for goods such as media when you can. Amazon is very good for this. Media is often a bit more expensive here - new games are about £40+ for consoles, which isn't veyr favourable considering the exchange rate, but it's something you have to take. Food also sounds quite expensive in comparison, but if you cook for yourself it is possible to eat very cheaply.

And if he has 2 years left at 180,000 but knows we won't extend his contract past then (he'll be 34) then he can go to a good club who will offer him 3 years at 125,000. The money is guaranteed and he can extend his career. 

Anyway, I actually think this season may be the perfect time to offload him proactively, especially if the club is going to try for Pogba, rather than wait until he actually is too old, his performances drop and we are left with no good offers for him.

Nobody seems to.  The only time I ever see appeals to the free market, is from people who in their next sentence will proceed to lambast any and all forms of government regulation and 'interference'.

It's like, helloooo, without government regulation you don't have a free market, you have a market which is variously corrupted, monopolised, subverted or plain ol' descended into anarchy.

How do you ensure companies actually compete via the marketplace and not via random acts of violence?  Laws.  How do you ensure the market takes account of externalities?  Laws...

I really don't know if all the 'Libertarian' who don't seem to get this extraordinarily basic concept, are shrewdly not getting it because they'd very much rather externalities _don't_ come out of their bottom line, and they'd prefer if they _don't_ have to compete on a level playing field... or if they're just absolute morons.

However, the way that people think about risk and betting does not take place in a world of perfect knowledge. 

The size and value of betting has much to do with the popularity of the question than the risk of the question. The bigger the competition (the Premier League in this case) the more bets you will attract. As long as you are getting a large number of bets in, you can, and NEED to, keep the odds low.

Lots more people are interested in question of where Spurs end up in the Premier League than whether Spurs win the UEFA Cup. The latter doesn't even make it to the top 10 of biggest trophies a player can win in professional football.

Betting companies don't have to advertise with tempting odds to get people betting on the PL. Secondly, in case Spurs do end in the top 4, the payout will bigger due to the larger pool of people involved.

The Europa League, however, does not get much attention. To get enough people putting money on it, the odds are made more attractive than they really are. If you got a secondary product, you gotta work harder to sell it. Secondly, almost regardless of how hard betting companies sell the Euorpa League--the secondary product--not nearly as many people will make the bet in the unforeseen event from the better's perspective that Spurs actually win it.

You're empathy really shines through sir, but consider if you will some other factors, such as the methods employed by the tobacco industry; mass social engineering, the suppression of evidence and the subversion of science, media, government, law and policy the world over.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3490543/

&gt;It's been PROVEN that smoking rates have fallen in no small measure because tobacco products are so bloody expensive now.

Again I'd have to add public health campaigns, access to information, the smoking ban and more recently the explosion of e-cigarettes.

&gt;Now consider cannabis, which is currently illegal, difficult to find, expensive and risky to obtain.

Who told you it was difficult to find? It depends where you live, of course, but mostly it's very easy to find, and have delivered, to your door. There isn't much risk in being caught buying one bag of weed either. 

&gt;What exactly do you think the occasional weekend toker will do once it's freely available and dirt cheap? Yup, he'll be smoking it every chance he gets.

Erm, no. Everybody's different but if somebody's happy just being a weekend toker then this would generally have no bearing, as I said it's already very easy to get hold of.

&gt;While that's his choice, it's just yet another self-inflicted malaise that will cost the taxpayers a damn fortune 40 years down the line when it turns out habitual cannabis smoking IS also dangerous for you.

People have been using it medicinally since 2737 B.C. Now I'm not saying that smoking it is completely safe, but there are other methods such as ingestion and vaporising that avoid this.

&gt;You want to choose exactly what you want to eat, drink and smoke, that's fine. Just don't expect the taxpayer to pick up the tab. I'd like to see mandatory insurance against self-inflicted illnesses. Social Welfare should not include picking up the tab for avoidable problems.

May I ask how old you are? How long have you had the benefit of the national health service?

The rest of the article is just incoherent without a structure. He babbles on about Fifa, history, Manchester United and Can briefly and I fail to see how his point in the title matches what he actually says in the article.

I got 10 GCSEs at A*-B and got onto my A level courses just fine.
I didn't do as well in college because I never figured out how to study. 
You need to know how to do this, especially if you're hoping to go to university for a course with exams.

I got a first at uni in an art based degree, so depending on what sort of subject you're going for, you might be ok, considering your study style sounds very similar to how I and many of my friends at school approached it.

What I will say though is that you shouldn't completely cut back your social life.
You'll learn more about becoming a likeable person by mixing with people than spending your time in a book.
When it boils down to it, universities and employers will always have a first impression of you and if you're used to making friends and chatting with people, this will put you in a better position.

Wait, did I say weed? I meant alcohol. If more people get stoned instead of getting drunk, you're likely to see a reduction in all of the things I mentioned above. True, you might have the occasional freakout, and true, some people who are sensitive to it might have psychological problems from smoking it, but the benefits outweigh the negative consequences caused by alcohol.

Not only that, but since we already have a hedonistic population that insists on getting fucked up one way or another at the weekend, a percentage of people who are already stoned will make the decision not to get so fucking drunk.

For instance, you want to discuss the odds changing *if we win this tie*.  However, it would shift the other way if we were to lose.

null,false,knacker_farts,lfc68,,null,"Q.What are the Champions League rule changes?
A: From 2015/16, the Europa League winners and the Champions League winners will both qualify for the following season's Champions League.

Q: Will the maximum number of clubs from the top nations such as England in the Champions League remain at four clubs?
A: No, there will be a maximum of five clubs but only under special circumstances.

Q: When can a country have five clubs in the Champions League?
A: Only when a club wins the Champions League or Europa League but finishes outside the top four in the domestic league. That happened last season when Chelsea finished sixth in the Premier League but took the Champions League spot from Tottenham who finished fourth, because they were European champions.

Q: Will a country be able to have six clubs if both Champions League and Europa League winners come from the same nation and both finish outside of the top four?
A: No - five is the maximum. In that unlikely scenario, the European trophy winners would qualify plus the top three.

Q: If the Champions League or Europa League winners finish inside the top four of their domestic league, will that allow the runners-up to qualify?
A: No, only the winners.

Q: Will the Europa League winners go straight into the group phase of the Champions League?
A: That has still to be confirmed but it appears that will usually be the case.

Q: If the Champions League or Europa League winners also qualify via their domestic league, will that allow the fifth-placed club in the league to take the 'spare' qualification place?
A: No, in that scenario there would still only be four clubs qualifying.

&gt;  To get enough people putting money on it, the odds are made more attractive than they really are.

The only real way to do this is to reduce the vig.  For plural outcome events the vig can be simulated through the sum of all odds.  You will notice that the sum of all odds is some number beyond 100%.  The bookie essentially gets paid this difference. (If this is not the case, someone could simply bet 1M on all outcomes to guarantee a net win).

For the difference in these sums for the two sets of odds I cited, prorating the difference back into the two individual sets of odds does not significantly alter the initial analysis in this case.  This may differ if the odds are closer together and/or the sums of odds are further apart.

~~You were correct, though, in that the odds were much better for bettors for the Europa competition (less total vig).~~

EDIT:  after screwing up the above calculation, checking my work, and fixing...the total vig for Europa was 19% and the total vig for Top 4 was 17% -- so odds were actually slightly better for Top 4.  Prorating this back into the odds, the ""vigless"" odds for Top 4 is 9/2 while the ""vigless"" odds for Europa is 17/1.

2. O2 - Poor 3G, but good 4G and good signal as well. However their networks are often oversubscribed meaning sometimes you get full signal but you're not sending/receiving anything.

I'm not worried about the HurriKane - he's young and tireless.

I am worried about the sudden brain farts that still pop up in the back 4, though.  I think we can do enough offensively to get a lot of wins and draws, but I fear our defense will snatch more than a few draws from wins and losses from draws. :(

But, overall, considering the scenario we found ourselves in during the summer--

new coach

diminshed returns on the Bale bail money

a locker room with a couple of sore thumbs

the usual ""what the hell will Levy actually sell/buy?""

no known striker (c'mon, we all thought Kane would be good, but not excellent)

Whether Lamela was going to continue his Lame Stella period

Delusions of adequacy at left back

Superjan seemingly having retreated to his Fortress of Vertonghitude

Real Madrid putting bloodhounds on Hugo's scent

anything else?

There was talk about a potential for a Messi move, which Mou wouldn't entertain it because of FPP which may be different with a large large Courtois move.  

I'm not suggesting, **at all** that we would have Messi if we sold Courtois. 

The point is 3-5 years is a long long time, and I really don't think it would necessarily be stupid to have sold Courtois.  

&gt;There are much more replaceable players we could sell.

Not at the value you could get for Courtois.

null,false,cana12,null,null,null,"Completely agree that 'Number 2's' is beyond insulting to everyone working in the industry. Insulting to the measure that that is what was commissioned ahead of any of the writers and directors whose work is so clearly better. What's really sad about it is that BBC NI behind the scenes apparently have a 'no comedy' rule, and after this it will probably stand stronger - which is unfair to everyone else producing actually funny work. 

But I am curious about the nepotism? Are you able to say what family or families are co-coordinating this nepotism? Or do you just mean something like 'cronies'? 6 Degrees, London Irish and Scup all have different writers, directors and producers. London Irish wasn't even produced, directed or cast from here. The only real connection there is 'Stirling Productions' - who were the production company behind 6 Degrees and Scup. But again, different writers, directors and producers on the two shows. So I'm just finding it hard to see the connections.

Context is also important, 6 Degrees was not Troubles based, the complete opposite. Scup provides Irish Language Drama to a country that doesn't really have much of it - and they are done by a production company that, and it's no secret, is broke. 

As for NI Screen, arts funding has been consistently slashed here more than any other region and this year receiving cuts that might bin the entire industry. Still, in 2012 a NI Screen short film WON AN OSCAR (The Shore), and this year 'Boogaloo and Graham', also funded by NIS has already won a BAFTA and is nominated for an Oscar. The context being that despite no money or faith from the higher powers, good work does get produced. Also 6 Degrees ran for 3 series, based solely on viewer ratings. 

And in a way, they are all kind of brand new for the country, trying new things, and that's how the industry will progress. What is upsetting about Number 2's is that none of that applies. It's soulless. 

The problem as far as I can see it is lack of money primarily, and lack of faith from people who give the money (number 2's again will confirm their fears)

I've found that site can be pretty bad not only at effectively analysing your own stance on issues but also the stances of the political parties. I support Plaid Cymru, and maybe it's because that party sees very little coverage in the media, but iSideWith seems to be incredibly bad at finding out what Plaid's policies actually *are*. 

Take the question on assisted dying, for instance. iSideWith has determined that Plaid does not support any move towards assisted dying. It proffers [this article](http://www.lifenews.com/2014/12/11/wales-assembly-defeats-bill-to-legalize-assisted-suicide/) as a source. The article has nothing to say on the party's stance towards the issue, but it *does* say that a Plaid AM first tabled the motion in question. Strange.

After doing some more digging, I found [the relevant voting record](http://www.assembly.wales/en/bus-home/pages/votes.aspx?MeetingId=2770#2770_0002_000_180331) on the National Assembly's website, which shows that, of the 12 AMs who voted in favour of the motion, 7 were Plaid AMs, including the party leader. 1 Plaid AM voted against, 2 abstained and another 1 apparently wasn't present. Surely, if anything, that's an indication that the party (or its Assembly Group, at least) *supports* assisted dying?

It doesn't even try to come up with a stance to fit the party on loads of other questions.

In the front bit you get about an hour &amp; a half's worth of really interesting journalism on politics, local politics, fleet st, the media, architecture, music, farming and so on. A lot of it's tenacious journalism (stories / villains covered over many issues) although for the most part it's not serious investigative stuff, they have a *lot* of insiders / whistleblowers / informants. Some of it is tittle-tattle; some of that is puerile, some is *good* tittle-tattle. 

Then you get the letters page, which is usually quite funny, especially when people get outraged about unfair treatment of UKIP. Then there's the ""funny"" part of the magazine, which fortunately is interspersed with cartoons which (mainly) are very good, sometimes satirically wonderful. (The fish food chain one in this issue is lovely BTW). A lot of the spoof news stories are a bit public-school-sniggering type humour; you can kind of imagine Hislop dreaming them up in the early 1950s. 

There's long-running spoof stuff. The current one (Cameron as headmaster of a public school) is fairly tame. Older ones are better: if you ever see the Dear Bill collection (collected letters of Denis Thatcher) buy them, they're unsurpassed genius. 

Behind that there's more proper journalism, and this is where the investigative / long-running stuff tends to be if it's not in a pull-out. It's great. 

Then there's classified ads. Join us in wondering for *decades* whether anyone actually gives money to those begging requests, and concluding that they're only people like us trying to *find out*.  

As you may have gathered, I'm a big fan. The individual cartoons / cartoonists are great; the journalism is pretty much unique and very valuable; the rest of the humour is withering on the vine in my opinion, but overall it's still one of few things I would seriously nominate as a National Treasure. (The others being sarcastic cheering at football matches, people who pass on their half-used parking tickets to strangers, and Charlie Brooker.)

A private sale will pretty much always get you the higher price, and a private purchase will usually save you the most money.

You could part-ex, and yes; You'll get less from a dealer than a private sale. This is because they need to make money on the bike themselves, and can't really over-price it to sell it on.

Dealers can't give you the price they'd sell it at, as it'd be a zero-profit investment, and that makes no sense for a business. Add to that; Inspection, cleaning, advertising &amp; listing costs, running costs of business, showroom space, and any workshop time it might need, then add a few hundred on top for profit.

Buying from a (reputable) dealer will cost you more, but you also get a limited warranty on the bike (varies), and you also know the bike runs and works properly, has been checked to make sure it's road legal, not stolen etc...

**Tip:** Whatever you do; a clean bike will probably get you more money. A modified bike is generally worth less or no more than the standard bike.

Back on topic: I think the argument that ""things are so much worse in Cambodia"" is silly. Since when do we need to compare ourselves to third-world countries that have been through a genocide (in that example) in order to make ourselves feel more noble? We should aim high! 

I have firsthand experience in the existing market, yes. I found it very difficult to get a job worth my skills and degree, because I couldn't afford to do all these ""unpaid internships"". I found one eventually though, it took me a while and I was a waitress in the meantime, but the reason I was able to get the waitressing job was because I had lied about my experience, that might not work for everyone, and luckily I had an overdraft to live on for a couple of months.  

""entire generation of starving/home less people"" is a hyperbole, of course, but this is the kind of direction you go in if you cut benefits when there are no good jobs around and living standards are SO SO low at the moment across the country. Homelessness is getting a lot worse, and so are benefits-related suicides.

What I'm arguing is that if people aren't finding work within six months, making them work for their benefits is essentially exploitation and if you're going to do that you might as well find them a job in the public sector, or at least supplement their training and/or education, which they can maybe pay back later.

Instead of making us leave, they gave us heavy buckets of ice (and I'm talking about really solid hard ice that were practically rocks) to throw at the cast. We were unsure at first but they told us it was fine and that they needed ice because they were doing a 'storm' scene. The cameras started rolling and the actors started running as me and my friends and the members of the film crew started chucking the ice at them. The actors kept running with the cameras following them and they did this a couple of times.

I forgot about it and never actually started watching the show until season 5 had ended. Watching the scene I saw shot with added CGI was weird enough, but what was weirder was a whole show taking place where I had spent a large portion of my childhood and teen years at.

Having all the road knowledge you've acquired while driving will certainly help when you start riding. So the chances are you'll be much better off when you take your CBT than the rest of your group as you'll just have to get to grips with the gears, throttle and balance.  Which won't be too much of a stretch. 

As for the bike, check out [this](http://cycle-ergo.com/) and find something that you like the look of (honda varadero does seem to be a good choice for the taller people). 

The only thing I really have to say though, owning a bike isn't really as cheap as you might think. Yes insurance will be cheaper, and the actual bike might be cheaper, but after you factor in all of your gear, tests (assuming you want to progress off a 125) maintenance etc it really isn't as cheap as you would imagine.

null,false,SYSTEM_USER,null,null,null,"Some of what is termed ""renewable"" is not necessarily completely renewable.

For example, Iceland use a huge amount of geothermal energy. After 30 years+ of intense development of geothermal energy around Reykjavik, some of the geothermal reserves are running down - the temperature in the earth's crust is dropping, as energy is being drawn out faster than it is being replaced from deep within the earth.

Wind and solar don't suffer this type of depletion in this way. However, there are potential limits - e.g. solar PV is incredibly polluting (there have been riots in China with PV factories ransacked because of pollution). Once built, the panels are not recyclable. They need electronics grade silicon, which needs to be absolutely free of certain impurities, and then precisely measured amounts of specific additives are added to form the circuits. The trouble is that if any of these additives get through the recycling process, then they will ruin the final product - so it's better to send the old panels to landfill and build new ones from virgin silicon.

You are also absolutely right about the issue of backup power. Wind and solar are reasonably predictable, and if you have enough of it, any fluctuations will be nicely smoothed out. However, wind is highly correlated, even across distances as large as the UK - so you usually get several dozen days a year with absolutely no wind anywhere in the UK. Worse, low wind speeds are correlated to periods of severe cold (when electricity demand is highest) - this phenomenon occurred in the recent cold snap over the last month or so. On the coldest days of the year, wind power contribution was less than zero (as the turbines had to switch on electrically powered anti-freeze heaters and spin the blades with motors to prevent them from icing up).

The problem with moving to fluctuating renewables is that you need fluctuating backup plant. Nuclear plants aren't suitable for this - you don't want to keep adjusting the reactor, because the constant tweaking wears it out prematurely and messes up your refuelling plans. So, this means using gas or coal.

In Germany, you can see the effect of this. 20% of German electricity is no wind powered. However, CO2 emissions from electricity generation haven't changed. Low carbon backup generation has been replaced by high carbon backup generation (although the political decision to phase out nuclear has also contributed substantially to this).",null,0,null,1424379138,null,0,false,0,coqq6lt,null,t3_2wfe12,null,t1_coqq6lt,null,t1_coqp6ko,null,null,null,1424682270,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

Go to [http://cycle-ergo.com/](http://cycle-ergo.com/) and plug in your dimensions on the 125s you like. If you don't know any 125 models, have a look at the websites of the big manufacturers, Honda, Yamaha, Suzuki, Kawasaki etc, or see what's the most common on ebay.  I would recommend one of the classically styled upright-position ones since you're tall, the good news is that's most of them. There's not an awful lot between them really, they're all about the same speed and have the same (basic) level of equipment. They'll all get very good mileage, 80-100mpg, and are all equally good for commuting. Do bear in mind though that you'll be limited to 60mph most of the time, less if you're going uphill. These bikes will do 70 if you're a tiny japanese test rider on a runway, not if you're a sizeable 6ft+ bloke with a rucksack on. That may or may not be a concern on your route.

The best course of action is to find a dealer near you with a bunch of 125 bikes knocking about and sit on them all, then see which one is the most comfortable.

Anyone who is saying that you have to get wet and nothing will keep you dry etc is wrong. Yes nothing is 100% waterproof but as long as your not planning on riding into a swimming pool that's not a problem.

You could get yourself fully kitted out in waterproof gear for around £350 if you shop around, use the sales (avoid no name brand stuff off ebay) and get proper winter waterproof gloves, jackets and trousers and boots. Remember 2 piece textiles are what you need for this, not leathers. They don't need to match or be a set either (mine sure don't and they are just as waterproof).

I think we need someone exceptional at DM who is also great at linking play up.  Pogba would be ideal but I don't see us being that fortunate so I'm thinking Vidal ? Or somebody like Vidal ?  I'm not really sure who is out there like them.. 

Koke would be amazing.  

Omar abdulrahmen

I would love to get him.  We tried in 2012 but his work permit was denied because the UAE was not in the top 75 in the world.  After this past Asian cup he played so well for them they moved up to 66.  This means he could now play in England.   He's much akin to David silva and Isco and is really a lot of fun to watch.    It would also be cool to have a middle eastern Messi since that's where the sheik is from, it would oddly fit just right.  

Lucas Moura 

We could use another excellent winger because Jesus is on and off and we really need some more width options with silva and Nasri being more central playmakers. So maybe somebody young and fast who takes players on, has really high acceleration.  Moura would fit the bill but he is probably too expensive.

If you are only switching to save money, you may be dissapointed.

Bikes are much more effort to look after and require service and maintenance more frequently than their 4 wheeled counterparts.

As a young, first time rider with no NCB to back you, your insurance is still going to be quite high, even on a 125.

By the time you have factored in your gear and security devices, tax, insurance, MOT, service consumables (assuming you are doing the work yourself, otherwise add labour to that as well) and not forgetting your licence, training and tests.... well, that is not pocket change for most of us.

At this point, you may be wondering why I'm raining on your parade and trying to talk you out of getting a bike. I'm not. Honestly.

I just want you to think about *WHY* you are getting a bike first. If it's to save money, you probably won't. At least not for a few years anyway.

Now, if you want a bike because you just want to ride, then fuck yeah! We're all with you mate! That is why we are here.

We ride for freedom, adrenaline and the occasional brown trousers moments. 

We ride for the thrill of speed, camaraderie and brotherhood.

If I get the train to work I'm going to spend £40ish/week which is about £2000/year but could be as high as £2,500

CBT + Bike + gear  came to about £1,700

Road tax + MOT + insurance + consumables is about £450/year

Then there's the DAS I'm doing which if I pass my MOD2 resit will come to around £600


So there is a point where I will start saving money (but not much). The difference is that 

*  I prefer commuting by bike

*  It's faster to commute by bike (15-30 minutes each way depending on circumstances)

*  When I get my A licence I can take my wife pillion which makes getting back from gigs easier.

*  Even a 125 is fun

Regular sections include Street of shame - a look at the news about/hypocrisy in the british press, HP Sauce - political stories and gossip, Medicine balls - health care / NHS problems, Media News - news / hypocrisy about the broadcasters, Rotten Boroughs - What services local councils have been shunting to their mates this week, and In the City - what business have been running around regulators recently.

They also have TV and book reviews, advertising, arts, music and education news, things about architecture/listing buildings, miscarriages of justice, prison problems, energy news, housing market news and more cartoons interspersed. Plus a mid section of funny pages spoofing news and columns you might see in other papers and a cryptic crossword I'm 90% sure is a spoof...

Pick up an issue and try it - it's kinda funny, interesting and at times alarming. Stick it by the bathroom and you'll learn about all sorts of shenanigans in areas of news you barely knew existed.
