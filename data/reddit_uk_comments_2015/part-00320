null,null,LinuxMage,eu,Luffbra,null,"Most universities in the country are now housing students on the campus, and not in the srrounding towns and cities.

Where I currently live is a classic example. Until 10 years ago, most of the uni's students did indeed live in shared accomodation around the town, and landlords were everywhere. Then, the university decided it would be better to free up a lot of the spare land inside the campus and built several thousand student accomodation blocks which now house all but the post-grad students that attend the uni.

A very large majority of the former rented houses from private landlords have since been sold back to families or renovated then rented as family accomodation. What is most telling is that a lot of the families that have now occupied them are immigrants, mostly from asia and the middle east. We do have some east europeans here, and they have rented some of the private houses as families, but they have proven a bonus to the town, and a lot now occupy jobs in the skilled and management sectors. 

My Lithuanian next door neighbour is in fact now a senior manager at his firm, and has been complaining that he is fed up of all the native british agency staff who are lazy and incompetent. He has asked his boss to start requesting East European workers, as they seem to be the only ones capable of doing a decent job.

https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/cars-and-other-vehicles/problems-with-the-car-you-bought/the-car-you-bought-is-not-roadworthy/

A dealer is absolutely not allowed to sell you a rusty car if means the car is not in a roadworthy condition. They have a duty of care to sell you a car fit for use on public roads that is not a death trap and are legally required to undertake their own checks beforehand! 

In my situation, the car was sold with a new MOT, however very shortly after I found faults that were 'MOT failures'. Suspicious that these had materialised so soon after the MOT, I checked the DVLA MOT History check service to review all previous MOT's (inc. fails), where I found a the car had failed an MOT for the previous owner 2 months earlier on these specific faults (before being sold the the garage I purchased from). 

https://www.gov.uk/check-mot-history-vehicle

Using this information, I was able to prove the faults were present before I purchased the car and, in my instance, that the car been given a negligent/fraudulent MOT. For yourself, this could offer concrete evidence that rusting was present when you purchased the vehicle from Sytner, if there are any previously listed advisories or failures relating to rusting on the chassis. 

Using the citizens advice guidance and the threat of passing on their details to VOSA (who govern MOT testing stations), the dealer agreed to foot the bill to rectify all the faults I had raised. 

Hope the guidance helps and good luck! I think you have a solid case here.

First off all, you cannot walk on the path without going through the visitor centre first. That seems alright, but the visitor centre is **1 mile** from the actual path and, unlike the Giant's Causeway where the centre is connected to the attraction via a private path, this is connected by public roads. 

Ok, so after you go through the visitor centre, you are looking forward to your nice family day out, right? Well, if you brought any elderly relatives, disabled relatives or your children with you...you are going to have to leave them in the cafe. Yes, that is what their policy dictates. You also have to stay behind if you are too short to fufill the height restriction (I can't remember what it is).

You know what is despicable though. They originally had the path split into 75%/25% portions. If you paid them, you could walk on the 75%, but you had to walk a mile along the narrow country roads to reach it (oh, there is no car parking at the path). If you went for the free option, you got the bus to the path but could only walk 25% of it.

Don't even get me started on how impractical it is for emergency services. The descent to the fields above the path is very steep with steps at the end. An Ambulance wouldn't be able to get down it, and a quad would probably struggle with the steps at the bottom. So what do you do if you slip and split your head? Well, you can either wait for the Air Ambulance from Scotland or the paramedics that are dropped off and sprint down the path. There are also no seats or toilets along the path, so have fun sitting on cold rock while blood is pouring out of your head!

And Ann Donaghy has her head so far up her arse that she sends Council staff to Milwauke, spending in excess of **£30,000 of ratepayer's money** with the sole ambition of marketing this shithole and health hazard of a tourist trap. 

Honestly, I am secretly hoping that someone gets injured and it gets in the national news. That, or maybe Poseidon will be generous and wash it away.

Total inflation since 1995 is 77.6%

Mass transit is cheaper than personal cars. Well, it's supposed to be.

I stopped taking the train to Leeds because driving

* Took about 1h30m, not 2h20m
* Cost about £14 for fuel and parking rather than £36 for a peak return
* Didn't penalize me for working at home 2 days a week
* Meant that while I couldn't read or sleep, I could at least sit down
  * Hell, in 10 years you could sleep in your self-driving car...
* Didn't get a cold every week from the mass of snotty commuters
  * Now I get my weekly cold from my daughter instead though

It might actually still be cheaper to take the train if the fares had kept pace with inflation since privatization - the fare would be about £11 rather than £36. But all I'd need is one car-sharer to wipe that advantage out decisively.

I see a distinct contradiction in the application of terms. I'm sure it also depends on the circles you participate in so two people will see different narratives that aren't necessarily reflective of the overall picture. I could be guilty of that. 

In my experience, SJWs are regarded as a non-existent 'bogeyman' whereas MRAs are unquestionably real and always extremists. Anyone painted as an MRA is nothing more than a lowest-common-caricature of an angry man who is out of touch with society and hates women. An SJW is characterised as activist fighting real issues who is being oppressed because they are fighting the status quo.

&gt;Yeah, probably. At this point the epidemic of false rape accusations must literally be the most propagated MRA talking point. Rape victims are routinely doubted and there is still great paranoia about women lying dominating any discussion. 

There are suggestions that the ""2-8% of rape claims are false"" statistic is misleading (http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/416536/how-common-are-false-rape-charges-really-jason-richwine) and not representative of reality. I think it may be a real issue, but *my* focus is more on how the media misrepresents such issues which ultimately drives narratives that cause this sense of the two sides being in opposition, rather than fairly discussing it. The real number could be lower or higher, the way in which claims are labelled as false is not an infallible system. That doesn't mean it is something that should be ignored, because false claims of anything harm real people. I'm struggling to find a reliable news based source, but there was a story recently of a mother committing suicide because her son was accused of sexual assault. He was innocent. A paediatrician (female) was mistaken for a paedophile and faced constant abuse despite never actually being accused.

Edit: A relevant example of the shitty reporting is the Independents article on a report about sexism in the legal profession. The leading part of the article was disingenuous.

http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/female-barristers-subjected-to-shocking-levels-of-rampant-sexism-says-bar-report-10413776.html

If you read the actual report, it says that sexism is a very minor problem today. Everyone the report interviewed stated that the situation has massively improved in recent years. It also stated that the cost of family life, raising children or being depended on in any way was the biggest barrier keeping women out of the legal profession. There's a real and indisputable issue affecting women, yet they lead with the narrative that unfairly paints men in that profession as sexist and driving women out of the industry.",null,0,null,1439937761,null,null,1439938757,0,cu7lil8,null,t3_3hg7g3,null,null,null,t1_cu7j8ue,null,null,null,1441331456,null,14,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14,null

I understand that, but my issue is more with how the term is applied to a person. The slightest suggestion of comments like my former example makes you an extremist MRA. Your opinion doesn't count because you're entire existence is painted as an unreasonable misogynist. It's entirely unreasonable to characterise people in that way and outright dismiss them, and in Reddit terms the downvotes (to the point of hidden comments) remove them from conversation for no valid reason.

Again this goes both ways and the same unfair labelling occurs with calling people SJW to discount them. The same occurs with political leanings in fairness.

&gt;On your other points, MRAs usually seek out anything they can to disprove feminism, to claim that men are actually the oppressed sex, and in doing so they (usually) make a massive deal out of insignificant issues. Sure, they may be issues, and we should talk about them, but MRAs blow them way out of proportion and talk about them so much that even mentioning these issues gives off a creepy, MRA vibe.

Agree entirely. The 'Oppression Olympics' is counter-productive for all sides and only broadens the gap, and incites further hatred.

I will say this; the new range of fords (in fact from about 2006 onwards) are really well made. The mondeo for example is probably the best car in its class. I would get one above an equivalent BMW or VW any day. I always think when I see people driving around in a BMW 320 or something ""you should have got a mondeo. It would have been cheaper, faster, better and cost less to maintain"". 

But here's the but... 

The thing with German cars is that yes, they do make equivalents of normal cars. BMW do the 320, 325, 520, 525 etc. Mercedes do the same with the A, B, C class. Even the E class to a certain extent. 

But they are not the cars they are renowned for. They make their names in things like the astounding 535 diesel. The 540. The 740, 750 the 760li. Same with the E55, the monstrous E63. All the S classes. The Audi S and RS series. All the AMGs. The absolutely perfect M3 (up to the E92). The terrifying M5. (I refuse to acknowledge the M4.)

So when people say ""if you want a good car; get a German one"". They don't mean a Passat (it's ok, but just get a mondeo). They mean get an SL63 AMG. Preferable the Black edition.

 As for insulting Corbyn personally maybe not him, but saying he's 'Not credible' is bullshit, everyone apart from the Labour centre-right and the media can see that while Corbyn himself may be on the far-left of the party, the platform he's running on for leader is not.

I couldn't disagree more about playing Coutinho out on the left. First of all, when you say he's looked better out wide that doesn't actually mean much since he drifts inside and alternates with out central attacking midfielder. Secondly, we have seen from the past seasons that Coutinho's best role is a number 8 role (so the left side of the diamond, for instance) where he can have players making runs in front of him, and where teams find it more difficult to mark him out the game. His next best position is down the middle, anyone who has watched Liverpool for more than the past few games can tell you this.

During the wilderness years the novels, comics and audios all made additions to the Master's story that require lots of mental gymnastics and fan theories to join together.

This is the best timeline I've seen that incorporates the Master from all media without using alternate timelines:

I'm going to use one of my old comments to try to explain, but it could be something like:

[Our fares are actually very competitive against Western European fares, but in certain ways.](http://www.seat61.com/uk-europe-train-fares-comparison.html#.VdOw2flViko) The difference is that ticket prices in this country are very price discriminating, you will pay a lot more if you buy your ticket close to the day of travel or you travel at peak times, whereas in other European countries they are much more uniform across the board.

Here the policy dilemma is whether you think people should be rewarded for buying in advance and travelling at weird times, at the expense of those who buy last-minute or travel at peak hours. I am agnostic on the first issue, but I think there has to be some incentive to make people travel at off-peak times to lighten the load of peak hours.

When it comes to comparing prices you also have to take into account subsidies, [which in this country are essentially nil but can be quite substantial in other Western European countries](http://i.imgur.com/LwiVf29.png). Again, the question here becomes who do you think should pay for railways, [those who use them or the taxpayer at large](http://i.imgur.com/s87V2gH.png)? I think there might be an argument that commuter trains should be subsidised to incentivise people to take trains to work and not cars (although to be honest, we should just tax petrol more). But my admittedly unresearched gut feeling is that medium and long journeys are mostly used by day-trippers, tourists and businessmen who I don't think need help from the taxpayer.

While I'm on the subject, I'd like to point out that British railways actually rate very well [in terms of customer satisfaction](http://i.imgur.com/DY3vr9J.png) (second best in the EU), and other more specific customer ratings such as [train frequency](http://i.imgur.com/6QM51kg.png) (second best) and [punctuality](http://i.imgur.com/1eGKz92.png) (third best).

In the interest of fairness, we perform poorly in terms of punctuality for [local and regional trains](http://i.imgur.com/e48GkWw.png) (fifth worst, though still 92% of trains with less than five minutes delay, no worse than France and only a few percentage points below most other Western European countries), but [do quite well for long-distance trains](http://i.imgur.com/XbN0EyL.png) (seventh best with 91.7% less than 15 minutes delay, slightly below Nordic countries and slightly above France, but miles ahead of Belgium's 82.4%, Holland's 81.4% and Germany's 78.3%).

To be honest, there are central problem lines but in general our railways are effective and cheap on the taxpayer, I don't see how nationalisation will make them better.",null,0,null,1439938936,null,null,1439939139,0,cu7m6sp,null,t3_3hf6zt,null,null,null,t1_cu76oei,null,null,null,1441331773,null,6,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

You can argue Miliband was planning to do it too quickly. However, I don't think that was the case.  He had a clear plan to reduce the deficit, but to do it in a much more fair way than the Conservatives were suggesting;  a way that would have reduced inequality and increased funding of the NHS.

* Burnham - Who I originally signed up to vote for. Stopped supporting when he started out by saying he'd back welfare cuts, then the flip flopping began, the highlight of which has to be the on again off again position of Corbyn in his potential cabinet. I have no idea where he stands so I can't vote for him(bit like a lot of the public with Ed)

* Cooper - Was my 2nd preference for a while, but as soon as she came out saying being a woman was more radical than anything Corbyn had to say I had a rethink. Since then I've realised she's offered nothing new since the start of the campaign, she just repeats the same old catchphrases and her new one midreads the mood of the members completely. Saying that voting in Corbyn would be 'Turning the clock back.' Which is actually true to an extent, but to a point where Labour stood for something people could recognise. You can't call for the 'spirit of '45' and then say you'll only look to the future(and whatever vague science hi-tech jobs it brings with it)

* Kendall - Simple really, I don't agree with her on a lot of things: She's not opposed to free schools, or private companies operating in the NHS, wants a cross-party campaign to stay in the EU(since it worked so well for Labour in Scotland), was one of the only MPs who basically backed the welfare reforms &amp; she wouldn't recognise Palestine as a state if elected leader.

This does have a Daily Fail vibe to it - hell a Tesco head office bod or PR chap/chapette may see it. Imagine how big this company is, someone with clout will use Reddit and may even be on this sub.

You've chosen a topic that is in the news in a big way. Normally this sort of thing wouldn't really be worth anyone's time, but all the supermarkets are on the defensive about milk prices at the moment. Tesco screwing up a milk order to a store, and the gaffer demanding hundreds of litres to be poured down the drain just to make sure they make some money back from the supplier... now that is media worthy right now. Imagine if a dairy farmer or his friends/family saw this you know they'd be to the press in a shot.

Don't imagine a throwaway on Reddit makes you anon unless you're using a VPN or Tor. Quick email to Reddit from a Tesco legal bod, and they have your IP address. If they wanted to push it that far if they get bad press from it they could.

Delete this, or if you feel that strongly that what they've done is wrong contact Tesco head office - at least be an official whistleblower that covers you to some extent.

Stupid question, but have you read the Tesco whistle blowing policy? Some corporate one's can be quite harsh. This thread could be considered an inappropriate whistle blow - then you are in trouble. I guarantee Tesco have official channels for dealing with this sort of thing and ways to smack you down if you circumvent them.

While he deserves credit for these things, the board and Huw Jenkins also have been very positive in the fact that they've made sound decisions and seem to be working with Monk rather than against him.

Honestly we're in a pretty good place at the moment in terms of depth. I worry a bit about what would happen if we were unlucky enough to lose both Williams and Fernandez to injury in terms of strong fullbacks, but the odds of that happening are low. While we do at the very least have Amat to back up one or the other, I don't know that any of our other fullbacks are really up to the standard we're used to seeing from those 3.

Realistically, if we can maintain the kind of form we've had these last two weeks, I'd be surprised if we didn't finish top 8. I think many of us are hoping that we'll manage to get a Europa League spot for the upcoming season to really keep the team progressing and pushing for more.

Since we're not playing at home, I'd say we're probably looking at 2-0 Swans if we score first, 2-1 or 1-1 if we don't.

Honestly I haven't watched Sunderland too much this last season. I've seen some of the results and highlights, but they don't really offer a complete picture of what's going on. With that said, their results have been really rough and the freshly promoted teams have looked surprisingly strong so far. Unless those 3 start to drop points, the only real hope I see for Sunderland is if teams like Newcastle keep doing poorly.

I'm an actual domestic violence victim; it came to a head when an ex girlfriend clocked me around the side of the head (repeatedly) with a frying pan, fractured my skull (and caused internal bleeding that they had to relieve - I apparently was actually lucky to survive that one) and broke my jaw, then proceeded to cause major swelling and bruising to my testicles when she stamped on them. I got out of hospital, was very clearly nervous to go home and share a flat with her, and asked the police if there was anywhere I could go. Their counsellor ended up out of desperation asking a battered wives centre if they'd be willing to help - they refused, because they felt that I would present a threat to the women. We even went to the council to see if they could help with temporary emergency accommodation; their response was pretty much the same...If I'd been a domestically abused *woman*, there are procedures in place; I, as a man am fucked, and I have no doubt that it would be the same if you were a straight or a gay male in a similar situation. There is very little out there for men that face similar situations as women in domestically abusive relationships, and I can tell you from *personal* experience that the treatment from the police is a joke, and to add insult to injury, because at the time I was utterly friendless, I ended up *homeless* because I wouldn't...*Couldn't* go back to my own home. I'm still in therapy, and I *still* struggle with memory issues from time to time, and I struggle to maintain a relationship now - a guy that had done that would have prison time; she got bound over to keep the peace for 18 months.

This is what bugs me though. This is what *really* gets to me - there are people looking at their screens right now, *right this second*, and their default line of question will be ""well, what did *he* do?"" - there won't be any consideration that I'd done nothing to deserve it aside from not having spent as much time with her as I'd have like because I was trying to build a career - it'll be an automatic assumption that I'm the guilty party. The first question that came out of some of my girlfriend's friends mouths was ""What did you do to deserve it?""

Yeah. What did I do to deserve it indeed.

So please. Go ahead and tell me that feminism gives a shit about these things, and while you're at it, please go ahead and show me the footage where they've campaigned for shelters for men in desperate situations as well.

Ok fine, if we play like we did last night against Arsenal we could easily concede 4 again. Why did we get away with it last night? Because it was Bournemouth.

Coutinho offers more defensively? I can definitely understand that point of view, personally I think they offer a similar amount - it's difficult to say who offers more. One thing I will say though is that Lallana offered 10x more defensively last night - I assumed Coutinho was struggling with lack of match fitness to be fair to him, but he was a complete liability 2nd half.

Coutinho played #8 5 times in the league in 13-14 - only once 1 away from home when he was subbed at half time. I suppose we could get away with it at home but only if we score as frequently as we did back then.

Like, last season we were all upset with Balotelli because he wouldn't make positive runs, he'd just drop off and wait for the ball.  This season we have a striker who is playing very positive, and pulls defenders around so well but so far in the past 2 games we haven't gotten anyone moving forward to take advantage of it.  

Coutinho combined well with him a few times but in general Lallana, Coutinho, and Firmino seemed extremely hesitant to try and play through the opposing defense with him and it was immensely frustrating.  It also happened a lot when Clyne was able to carry the ball up quickly on the right wing... he'd pull the fullback and leave a really nice space for Coutinho to run into but Coutinho would just pull off of it and wait for a square ball (that often wasn't even there at all with a midfielder covering it).

I really disliked how slow and tedious our attack has been in the past 2 games and it just reeks of the slow, dull, and uninventive bullshit we all got to watch last season.  We need to be able to play fast, especially in transitions, if we want to open teams up.  I don't know if it's something in our tactics or something going on with the players being hesitant, but it's really frustrating to watch us not even try to forge chances for ourselves when we have clear opportunities to break and be rapid in our play.

She's actually acting like her being a woman speaks to people more than Corbyn's ideas, which is clearly doesn't. It's perhaps the worst side of identity politics, devaluing someone else's genuinely radical ideas because of your gender doesn't make any sense.

I don't think thats what she's doing at all, I think you're overreacting. She's never said 'I am more radical than corbyn because I'm a woman', she's questioned the legitimacy of a 'radicalism' that would bring back nationalisation and clause IV. She has also suggested that it's time to have a woman leader (true, it's long overdue), and she does want to help young mothers. She also mentioned something about feminist economics but I think that's a term for her childcare policy, makes sense to me.

&gt;You think Burnham is ideologically close to Corbyn because of a few flip flops? Burnham is still on the right of the party. The fact you had to come up with a joke for Corbyn sort of proves my point, he doesn't speak in exactly the same soundbites every time he makes an appearance. Burnham backs welfare cuts for fucks sake, he's still broadly right-wing, just trying to get some Corbyn voters on his side.

I think he's positioned himself closer to corbyn instead of trying to take him on, and I'm not happy about it.

&gt;By the way saying ""She stands for loads of stuff."" Doesn't fill me in on anything. She's vague as fuck and I don't vote for stuff, I vote for things I don't need an enigma machine and a PR guru to work out what's actually being offered.

Clearly you're the epitome of that. You're missing my point. I said he had a solid game against Bournemouth, but I would have been more impressed if he had scored the second chance and not won any aerial duels, not made any passes or tackles and not completed any dribbles because that would have sealed the game away. 

Besides Coutinho occasionally banging in thunderbolts who else on the team do you have absolute confidence in to score regularly? When we're playing with one striker up top he should be getting goals or at the very least testing the keeper. Look at how many shots and chances Aguero fashioned against City. Now that's world-class. I don't expect Benteke to be a bigger Aguero but I'd be happier if he'd had more shots on targets and forced the keeper to make more saves. 

All this about expectations. Yes I have expectations. I'm a Liverpool fan, not a Portsmouth fan. We are Liverpool, we should be winning games and our strikers who cost huge amounts of money to bring in, are on massive wages and are practicing shooting all the time in training should be either hitting the back of the net or testing the keeper all game. It's not enough for a striker or any player of ours to ""work hard"", put me on the pitch and I'd work my ass off, I'd chase every ball, but am I worth 32.5mil? No because I can't score goals like him. So at the very least I expect our strikers to be making runs, having plenty of shots on target and scoring goals, the other aspects of their game are secondary. It's why I rate Sturridge so highly. Yes he's fast and a great dribbler, but it's the fact that he's always getting into dangerous positions and that he's fucking lethal in front of goal that I appreciate the most",null,0,null,1439945984,null,null,false,0,cu7q9mt,null,t3_3hfw57,null,null,null,t1_cu75d91,null,null,null,1441333741,null,2,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null

 Corbyn never said he would bring back clause IV and nationalisation isn't something to be 'brought back.' That implies there aren't organisations that are in public hands, it also has broad support from the public but yeah, you must be right having a woman leader is more important than broad public support.

 Burnham to be fair to him has recognised that the membership are fed up with New Labour, but he's still a part of it so he can't distance himself enough to win enough support I feel. ""Taking him on"" could've been done without attempting to alienate many of Corbyn's voters from the Labour top brass.

I just went on [Cooper's website](http://www.yvetteforlabour.co.uk/policy) and it's a fucking joke in terms of policy. Big pictures of her face next to some slogans and no further explanation. I thought the answer was at the bottom of the page when it said ""Click here to find out more about Yvette's policies."" It just directed me to the news page where all it talked about was endorsements.

I always find it amazing that MRAs want to legislate against false rape accusations, but also think male rape goes unreported and should be believed more. You can't have it both ways. 

I'd also say that feminism isn't necessarily incompatible with increased freedom for men. I don't like terms like 'patriarchy' but I do think men are constrained in the way they allowed to act without be accused of being 'girly'. MRAs seem to want to defend traditional conceptions of masculinity which bind men to certain roles and cause things like suicide and self harm. 

There's also no discussion of black men, gay men, transmen etc in MRA conversation. The same cannot be said for feminism. It seems to only want to defend a particular type of men - and by defend I mean attack and by men I mean women.

null,null,Stompy119,null,null,null,"I mean, the reason people called Davies over Rose was because he was much more defensively solid during the prior season. While I support Tottenham, I love the game of football and watch every chance I get. I watched a good few Swansea games and he was very impressive, especially considering his age. He was and will never be the athlete that Rose is, but it was not an unwarranted call after Rose's season. Rose was very shaky at the back and didn't contribute enough going forward to justify it. DISCLAIMER: I am a big fan of Rose and very glad he's stepped up. Hope to see a continued growth from him.

Now likening that situation to Mason, they're very different. Anyone who thinks Mason is shit is silly. Though I am in the camp that he is not a top four (aspiring) calibre starting XI player, I think he is invaluable to the squad. He brings fire and passion and tenacity that is infectious. That's not all he brings, I think he's a good player. Decent vision and a pretty good passer of the ball. I expect him to be depth for Bentaleb as the season gets into full swing, maybe the occasional shout at CAM as well, I think he's suited enough to play there as depth. I kind of went on a tangent there, but basically what I meant to say is that Rose was negatively affecting the squad. It was mistakes, errors that cost us points and goals. Mason puts his all in, and for the most part doesn't make many errors, he just isn't quite the calibre we need in our starting XI if we are challenging for top four. 

Unpopular opinion probably, but I would say we are 2-3 years out from challenging and don't mind Mason in the side now, i just don't see him as the way going forward.

Yeah, but since feminism is for everyone, not just women, you'll no doubt be able to quickly compile a list of feminist events, fundraisers, support for male domestic violence shelters, lobbying, etc to help this issue and others such as the huge disparity in attainment in education between girls and boys, custody court biases, the fact only men can be rapists under UK law etc won't you? 

Feminism is for everyone after all. Considering this undeniably true fact, it's weird that I've completely missed feminist groups doing a single thing for men or any outcry among feminist groups or websites or even on social media sites like this about things like the incident linked to by the OP. I'll admit I don't go to feminist websites like Jezebel very often, but on the occasions I've gone to them I must've missed all the articles focusing on men's issues. Most curious.

Good for you I guess, but the person I was replying to was denying it. 

&gt; The question is whether you start hating all black rights activists or feminists because of those people.

I think there's a meaningful difference between the two movements: feminism has become top-down, black activism has not. Feminism has developed a consistent and established presence in media and academia that black activists have been (relatively) unable to replicate, the obvious explanation being that women had a massive head-start by virtue of being far more likely to have preexisting class privilege.

Feminism's colonization of academic spaces has led to a blurring of the line between ideology and scientific theory. In order to maintain their position they have had to become viciously exclusive of alternative points of view. This is visible in the treatment of women like Erin Pizzey and Christina Hoff Sommers, who dispute the validity of Patriarchy theory as an all-encompassing theory of gender. That same ""theory"" (which is in fact little more than a rhetorical device, untestable, and incapable of making predictions) is at the heart of every model of domestic violence that erases men. It tells men they should be happy with vague promises of ""fighting gender roles"", rather than actual tangible progress like men's shelters which would challenge gender roles merely by existing. Fight for those and you're a bit too close to saying men are oppressed, which is *creepy.*",null,0,null,1439952799,null,null,false,0,cu7u9ng,null,t3_3hg7g3,null,null,null,t1_cu7pc2g,null,null,null,1441335626,null,9,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9,null

Hart

Zabaleta Kompany Mangala Kolarov

Fernandinho Yaya Silva

Navas Aguero Sterling.

2) Where do you think City will finish this season?

First. Chelsea will be second. Arsenal and the rags will battle for 3rd.

3) Where do you think Everton will finish this season?

In a fight with Liverpool for 5th. If they hit a rough patch they could fall behind Southampton but I expect that more of Liverpool than I do of Everton this year. 

4) Who in your opinion is your best player?

Aguero and Silva are too close to call. Aguero is the best striker in the world IMO(I havent heard a convincing arugment yet that Suarez is better other than he hasn't had the injury issues the last two season) but Silva controls the game better than anyone I can think of. Every touch this season has been perfect and he seems to play the Iniesta role of our midfield-3 better than Iniesta does. Honestly, I think based on his form this season I would have to give it to Silva. Only thing I would like him to do better is fire some of the 50/50 shots he has. He always is looking for the pass in those situations but IMO he could add 7+ goals to his season if he fired away. 

5) If you could have one player from Everton, who would you take?

Leighton Baines for LB. No question. Arguably our weakest position and Baines is the best LB in the premier league IMO. I'm not the biggest fan of Barkley and we have too many strikers to for Lukaku. Honestly, I think Baines is the only player for Everton who would make it into our XI.

6) What is your most memorable moment supporting City?

""Balotelli AGUEROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! I swear you will never see anything like this ever again.""

7) What do you think the final score will be? (I predict a 2-2 draw)

3-1 with a Sergio brace. We always seem to get the better of Howard and Sergio looks to be on the verge of a run of form similar to the one he ended the season on, or perhaps he is just continuing how he finished the season. I think we'll go into the half up 2-0 from an Aguero Goal and a Yaya free kick. Lukaku will score to make it interesting 10 minutes into the 2nd half and then Aguero will get his second around the ~75 minute mark with Bony already warming up on the sidelines about to come in for him.

And no, no job either. I finished it with a disability too. I know people who aren't particularly smart, and people in the same course who get 2:1s but get jobs at GS, BAML, MS, etc.

To make matters worse, I do actually get pretty far into the hiring process of great companies - I've never bothered applying to anything with a starting salary of less than 40k. I get commended on my market knowledge and intelligence upfront and in later feedback, but they find that I either ""lack confidence"" (a general term to say that they don't think I'm in from the same background they recruit from - so yes, nepotism), or I screw it up partly because of circumstances (try to remember a firm's CEO and other info after having a quant AC the next day after a 13 hour flight and a relationship upheaval).

Put simply, I'm from a working class background. My parents know zilch about the City, zilch about professional jobs (dad still earns less than a new graduate) and my mum's only rejoinder was that fresh grads shouldn't be in consulting because we haven't had any experience. My schoolmates? They don't just preferential access, they've been groomed for life, by their environment, parents' friends, everything. And it makes a difference.

Oh, and did I mention that I'm an international, so often after an application I get an email asking for confirmation of my right to work before they set up an interview. I'm limited to applying only to the biggest and/or most competitive companies because of that.

I actually HAVE wasted time railing about it, until I looked at the facts: 
If I want to spare my children this same ordeal I'm just going to have to suck it up and keep going. 
A LOT of people start out in similar positions. Either they find a way to re-position themselves during their uni, or they work hard to get noticed, even it's for 10 years (yes, it's happened).

And I'm sure you already know this, but just in case you don't,
Put that temp role to good use (network). Do jobs well for people and then start approaching the analysts and friendlier managers to explain that you are very interested in investing - start learning from them. If you do your current job well and they trust you, when there is a role in that firm or another firm, their recommendation will fast track you.

&gt; The oil price is the purest barometer of world growth

Oil prices are currently being explicitly manipulated by OPEC, to the point where Saudi Arabia is losing huge amounts of money and having to use its currency reserves, specifically to make fracking and other 'edge' methods of production unprofitable in order to halt their development and keep the monopoly intact for a while longer. Current oil prices have nothing whatsoever to do with world growth.

That being said, the credit that has been extended to companies investing in oil shale exploration is probably not going to be recouped, and any banks that are over-extended are going to go begging to their respective governments for yet-another bail-out, which they probably won't get and will lead to (where legal) having banks confiscate their depositors' money to stay afloat, followed by further collapse of consumer confidence and the broader economy, widespread anger, and depending on how widespread the contagion is, the toppling of a few governments.",null,0,null,1439954942,null,null,false,0,cu7vfry,null,t3_3hhwuj,null,null,null,t3_3hhwuj,null,null,null,1441336177,null,17,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,17,null

It was by no means a consistent performance. But the shoots of very promising growth are there. To expect anything more at this stage is setting yourself up for disappointment. If our attack doesn't get more flowing by game 8 or so, we'll have something to complain about.

In addition, it's important to remember that a chief complaint of this squad, for the last three seasons, has been defensive fragility. We haven't seen much of that in the first two games. So we may not have consistently free-flowing attack (yet) but our defensive system and set up seems to be developing very nicely indeed. 

Finding complaints is easy. Every team -- even Man City, who've looked formidable -- have their problems. Rodgers appears to have put good building blocks in place that could very well yield great results this season. I'd prefer to focus on that, personally.

&gt; This isn't.

What, that someone would have their ESA reduced/stopped for failing to write a CV? That the sanction would continue for a minimum period even if you did it? Is the huge contention that they said the person would be glad they'd actually written a CV?

&gt; BECAUSE IT'S FUCKING ABYSMAL DEHUMANISING BOLLOCKS, THATS WHY AND YES I AM FUCKING ANGRY ABOUT IT AND MAY JUST LEAVE CAPS LOCK ON FOR THE WHOLE FUCKING DAY, THAT'S HOW ANGRY I AM.

Do you think I'm arguing sanctions are a good thing, or that ESA is run well? Or that DWP are effective? I've argued *none* of those things. I just think that complaining about using a first-person example in an instructional leaflet to help explain the rules to people is ridiculous. I have a highly upvoted reply comparing this to posting pictures of rapes with quotes saying they were raped in the jobcentre, which is just insanity.

Bad arguments help nobody. Complaining about *everything the government does* because you're angry means any legitimate complaints will be completely ignored.

Why not have a better discussion and use time with FOI requests to get something useful? How about this:

# Should there be sanctions?

This can be split into four key questions:

1. Do sanctions get people into work quicker or more effectively?
2. What's the rate &amp; scale of harm caused from 'valid' sanctions (intentionally applied ones, which meet the spirit of the rules)?
3. What's the rate &amp; scale of harm caused from 'invalid' sanctions (like from the article: 'sanctioned for missing jobcentre appointments because they had to attend a job interview')
4. What's the cost or saving of running the sanctions system?

The last one is quite important, because if it's a low saving or net cost, then trials to just stop sanctioning people could be done for cheap or free. If in addition, 1 is ""no"" then the system should simply be stopped, as a net cost actively detrimental system shouldn't be run. Given the stats available, we may actually be able to have a reasonable crack at this (external costs are hard to estimate, but we can put a cap on direct savings by seeing how much was withheld). In 2014, for JSA, there were ~600k decisions to apply sanctions. The maximum JSA claim is £73.10/week so that's an absolute maximum direct saving of £45M * the average length of a sanction. Even assuming an average 4 week sanction that's only in the region of 3% of the JSA budget (2012 figures), and again that's trying to figure out a cap rather than the actual figure.

Trials around the country should be run to see what other options are available if unconditional payments are either too expensive or are significantly less effective.

null,null,ThePoeticMotion,null,null,null,"If we play like that against Arsenal we'll get twatted, I agree. But it would be a failing of our general play rather than the defense. We defended well. It was our overall play that was poor. 

Lallana's defensive contribution is being blown miles out of proportion. Yes, he made three successful tackles, but he also attempted 10 tackles, which means he had 7 unsuccessful tackles. He lost his man for Bournemouth's shot into the side netting and was waltzed around at least three times because he didn't anticipate the opposition's movement (which wouldn't have shown up in his stats). Two of his tackles came in quick succession and both were instances where he found himself in a 80-20 situation with the attacker. I've watched the game twice and had a keen eye on Lallana because I wanted to make sure I didn't miss anything with him by the way some people are talking about his defensive display, and I can say with certainty that I didn't. He was worse tonight than he was at Stoke, and he was awful at Stoke. I know you think I have a vendetta against him, but I don't. I genuinely want him to succeed. I just don't see him as anything more than a useful squad player. In contrast, Ibe has taken a lot of flack for his performance and whilst he gave the ball away more than Lallana, he actually looked threatening and lively, and contributed to our attacks. Lallana did his usually cruyff turn, cruyff turn, body feight then either get knocked off the ball or pass sideways after the chance to release a pass had gone. 

I don't know where your getting that stat from regarding Coutinho's starts at number 8 but it isn't correct. We've also seen plenty of times that Coutinho performs more effectively when he drops deep, whether he was explicitly playing there or dropping from his starting position. It's a no brainer for me in terms of both defensive contribution and, obviously, moving forward. The only hesitation I would have in moving Coutinho back would be that it looked as if him and Benteke were forming a good chemistry when played close to each other, but I'm sure Firmino will have similar positives in that position.

To be honest, I'd spend the time exploring the London suburbs to figure out what kinda place you want to live in.  They vary considerably in feel, style, cost, the types of people who live there, the quality of the transport.

I'd also read the FAQ's about how to search for a flat in /r/London .

I have around 20-30 favourite dinosaurs and a roughly equal number of other extinct animals. 

My favourite dinosaurs are pretty much all based on the artwork (we actually call it palaeoart *in the business*) of the [Orbis Dinosaurs! comic/magazine](http://www.partworks.co.uk/contents/en-uk/d406.html) that ran in the UK three separate times in the 1990's, and is a massive part of how I got where I am today.

Anyway, here's the list. Bar the first four there isn't a huge amount of order.

* *Piatnitzkysaurus*
* *Chilantaisaurus*
* *Noasaurus*
* *Pentaceratops*
* *Gasosaurus*
* *Pelorosaurus*
* *Arrhinoceratops*
* *Anchiceratops*
* *Quaesitosaurus*
* *Rhoetosaurus*
* *Hypselosaurus*
* *Haplocanthosaurus*
* *Tsaagan/Tsaaganestes*
* *Chasmosaurus*
* *Parasaurolophus*
* *Chirostenotes*, on which my Fantasy League team name is based (*Clynostenotes*)
* *Diabloceratops*
* *Kosmoceratops*
* *Amphicoelias*
* *Opisthocoelicaudia*
* *Achillobator*

and probably a few more that I'm missing. Despite the top few being theropods I'm more of a ceratospian/sauropod/hadrosaur kinda' guy.

In terms of non-dinosaurs;

* *Akaimia*, of which I'm currently describing a new species
* *Megantereon*
* *Homotherium*
* *Smilodon*
* *Eusmilus*
* *Barbourofelis*
* *Helicoprion*

And again a bunch of others. Basically all the spiders in Baltic amber, especially the cute little jumpers and assassins.

&gt;Electronic nicotine delivery systems (""e-cigarettes""): review of safety and smoking cessation efficacy.
Harrell PT1, Simmons VN2, Correa JB2, Padhya TA3, Brandon TH2.

&gt;Clinicians are advised to be aware that the use of e-cigarettes, especially among cigarette smokers, is growing rapidly. These devices are unregulated, of unknown safety, and of uncertain benefit in quitting smoking.

&gt;Hidden Formaldehyde in E-Cigarette Aerosols
N Engl J Med 2015; 372:392-394January 22, 2015DOI: 10.1056/NEJMc1413069

&gt;Inhaled formaldehyde has a reported slope factor of 0.021 kg of body weight per milligram of formaldehyde per day for cancer (http://oehha.ca.gov/risk/pdf/TCDBcas061809.pdf). Among persons with a body weight of 70 kg, the incremental lifetime cancer risk associated with long-term cigarette smoking at 1 pack per day may then be estimated at 9×10−4. If we assume that inhaling formaldehyde-releasing agents carries the same risk per unit of formaldehyde as the risk associated with inhaling gaseous formaldehyde, then long-term vaping is associated with an incremental lifetime cancer risk of 4.2×10−3. This risk is 5 times as high (as compared with the risk based on the calculation of Miyake and Shibamoto shown in Figure 1), or even 15 times as high (as compared with the risk based on the calculation of Counts et al. shown in Figure 1) as the risk associated with long-term smoking. In addition, formaldehyde-releasing agents may deposit more efficiently in the respiratory tract than gaseous formaldehyde, and so they could carry a higher slope factor for cancer.

 &gt;Use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) impairs indoor air quality and increases FeNO levels of e-cigarette consumers

&gt;By:Schober, W (Schober, Wolfgang)[ 1 ] ; Szendrei, K (Szendrei, Katalin)[ 1 ] ; Matzen, W (Matzen, Wolfgang)[ 1 ] ; Osiander-Fuchs, H (Osiander-Fuchs, Helga)[ 2 ] ; Heitmann, D (Heitmann, Dieter)[ 3 ] ; Schettgen, T (Schettgen, Thomas)[ 4 ] ; Jorres, RA (Joerres, Rudolf A.)[ 5 ] ; Fromme, H (Fromme, Hermann)[ 1 ]

&gt;Our data confirm that e-cigarettes are not emission-free and their pollutants could be of health concern for users and secondhand smokers. In particular, ultrafine particles formed from supersaturated 1,2-propanediol vapor can be deposited in the lung, and aerosolized nicotine seems capable of increasing the release of the inflammatory signaling molecule NO upon inhalation. In view of consumer safety, e-cigarettes and nicotine liquids should be officially regulated and labeled with appropriate warnings of potential health effects, particularly of toxicity risk in children.

&gt;Endothelial disruptive proinflammatory effects of nicotine and e-cigarette vapor exposures

&gt;The increased use of inhaled nicotine via e-cigarettes has unknown risks to lung health. Having previously shown that cigarette smoke (CS) extract disrupts the lung microvasculature barrier function by endothelial cell activation and cytoskeletal rearrangement, we investigated the contribution of nicotine in CS or e-cigarettes (e-Cig) to lung endothelial injury. Primary lung microvascular endothelial cells were exposed to nicotine, e-Cig solution, or condensed e-Cig vapor (1-20 mM nicotine) or to nicotine-free CS extract or e-Cig solutions. Compared with nicotine-containing extract, nicotine free-CS extract (10-20%) caused significantly less endothelial permeability as measured with electric cell-substrate impedance sensing. Nicotine exposures triggered dose-dependent loss of endothelial barrier in cultured cell monolayers and rapidly increased lung inflammation and oxidative stress in mice. The endothelial barrier disruptive effects were associated with increased intracellular ceramides, p38 MAPK activation, and myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, and was critically mediated by Rho-activated kinase via inhibition of MLC-phosphatase unit MYPT1. Although nicotine at sufficient concentrations to cause endothelial barrier loss did not trigger cell necrosis, it markedly inhibited cell proliferation. Augmentation of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) signaling via S1P1 improved both endothelial cell proliferation and barrier function during nicotine exposures. Nicotine-independent effects of e-Cig solutions were noted, which may be attributable to acrolein, detected along with propylene glycol, glycerol, and nicotine by NMR, mass spectrometry, and gas chromatography, in both e-Cig solutions and vapor. **These results suggest that soluble components of e-Cig, including nicotine, cause dose-dependent loss of lung endothelial barrier function, which is associated with oxidative stress and brisk inflammation.**

null,null,calculusprime,null,null,null,"&gt; I think Labour should stay out of NI. Simply because it will split the left vote further, and we've already lost a couple of seats due to a more unified right.

Is that necessarily the case though? Every election in NI is transferable vote except Westminster (the two seats you refer to I presume).

Some have put the rise in unionist electorate in recent years down to an increase in voting options (UKIP, TUV, PUP, NI Cons) which then trickle their transfers to the big two. A case of supply increasing demand etc. Or at least bringing out folk who otherwise couldn't face voting UUP or DUP.

So surely the Labour Party standing in Assembly, Council and European elections would be harmless at worst, and potentially helpful to ""the left"". I imagine there's quite alot of people of the left who might find voting SDLP and Sinn Fein first preference unpalatable for differing reasons for example.

I say this of course not as someone from the left, but certainly in favour of more policy-based parties.

The most harmful part of tobacco smoking is the tar and by products caused by combustion, nicotine itself is the lesser of evils in cigarette smoke, it is just that its addictive properties result in more smoking and therefore more exposure to the carcinogenic nature of the smoke.

The whole point of smoking cessation services is to reduce harm, therefore offering replacement therapies is of benefit and is a great way of dealing with addiction. Although a more extreme example, would you have the same opinion that you shouldn't offer heroin users subutex or methadone as a replacement for the gear? I know the people I have worked with in addiction services would be engaging in more risky/harmful behaviours if we didn't.

null,null,banal_penetration,null,null,null,"This has been brewing for a long time, and the causes should be obvious to anyone who thinks about it. 

In the 1950s, 5% of the population went to university. 10% if you include things like teacher training colleges. Those that did went into the professions. For those that did not, there were a whole range of options - apprenticeships, night school, technical colleges, whatever. 

The Robbins Report came around, and said we could double the number of people going to university without any drop in quality. So we did. Older universities expanded and places like York opened. Once again the graduates could roll out into professional level jobs, were they either directly used their degrees or used the advanced soft skills 3 years of intense study gives you. 

Then came the subsequent expansions. Every polytechnic became a university. New ones opened. The government decided that forty or fifty percent of people should go to university. They never asked, like Robbins did, what the effect on quality would be. They never asked what jobs these people would do. 

The universities sold themselves on a principle of ""get a degree, get a job"". They never said ""get a degree, compete for the finite numbers of degree level jobs"". So the 120-odd universities we now have began to churn out graduates for jobs that never exist. 

The result is that the same 20% of graduates as in the 1960s are going to get the professional level jobs. Generally, that will be the ones who get good A-levels, go to better universities and head towards accounting/law/STEM. The rest have been sold a lie that a degree is a license to print money. Instead, it is often an expensive  route to exactly the same job.

I work in the legal sector and it is plain to see. There are law degrees that have entry requirements of two C's at A-level. People go into them sold a dream of being a hotshot lawyer, only to find that those jobs go to those who have much better qualifications than them. Instead you now have secretaries and paralegals (which used to be jobs for school leavers) with degrees and the debts to prove it. 

We have fetishised university without significantly expanding the jobs that actually need degrees. This is hardly surprising. 

A friend of mine who left school  at 16 to be a roofer is now making more than a lot of people with degrees. He was bloody smart to have the balls to do that.

My source for this is my personal experience, for what that's worth, but I'd be very interested to see research into it, as a quick Google doesn't seem to indicate that it exists. But let's move past the case study issue, as we clearly disagree on this, but in lieu of evidence I doubt either of us has the time to collate, it's just down to basic observation. 

In terms of your questions about 'Should there be sanctions?', those are good questions, but they don't take into account the level of perversity and inconsistency with which the 'invalid' sanctions are applied and then defended and the difficulty of appealing against them.

Anecdotally, there also seems to be a system of targets for sanctioning, and whistleblowers have detailed this, but requests for evidence of are obfuscated and denied. Where the whole sanction system becomes really problematic is if, as you say, there isn't a huge relative saving, but that there are sanctioning targets for ideological reasons which it seems are being backed up by falsified propaganda such as these case studies and the fake twitter accounts.

My family are not well connected. They're not even close to being middle class. Within a year of graduating, I was earning more than my father who has worked at the same car plant for around 15 years. But once I got that first job, my degree made sod all difference. The companies I've since worked at, I would never have made the grad scheme for because I lacked a 2:1.

The IRB likes to claim TV audiences in the billions for the Rugby World Cup, but it's a pretty transparent lie when you consider America has more people than almost every other nation in the Rugby World Cup combined, and hardly anybody in Yankeeland cares. Where are the billions of viewers in this tournament coming from?

People complain that the UK media isn't that excited, but rugby just isn't that popular in the UK or around the world. It's great and the World Cup is great, but it's not the football World Cup or the Olympics and it doesn't deserve weeks of buildup. 

&gt; Soccer is popular in the US come world cup because despite being novel, it is easy to understand. 

Soccer has tens of millions of players in the US. Rugby has maybe 300,000. It is legitimately one of America's most popular sports. It's easier to understand but it's also something different, which feeds into...

&gt; Union isn't (coming from someone who has been exposed/playing the game since they were 10 and is still learning new things about the game), so it's not as popular. With the mass of athletic potential that is NFL and the people that don't quite make it, the US has a wealth of potential rugby talent, and I really hope they tap into it for the good of the game internationally.

NFL talent can't really make it in rugby, you need to have played the game since you were a kid. I never played American football and my coaches used to say it was noticeable how much quicker I read situations than my teammates who all did. If you're really smart, you can make up for a lot like Dan Lyle did, but you can't transcend that intrinsic know-how from flyhalf. Which is why the Eagles have had a foreign flyhalf almost constantly since I started playing and following the game in the late 90s.

Rugby's kind of growing in the US as an alternative sport, but it's not really offering anything dramatically different like soccer does. Plus the concussions thing that is looming over the NFL also looms over rugby, and that's going to become an increasingly big deal in years to come. At first I thought rugby would really clean up as people took their kids out of American football, but rugby has a lot of the same problems.  

&gt; And the Wales going out jab is low. They're the 6th best team in the World at time of posting and the only reason they'd go out this time round in the group stages is because they're in the ""group of death"".

null,null,Danderlyon,eng-Surrey,Surrey,null,"Yeah, this is true to my experience as well. You're either well connected, or you are extremely lucky, and even if you are lucky in getting a relevant job, you do not have the step up on life that the more affluent students have. I can give two examples - 

My friend from University - reasonably well off family, his father worked for Cisco in management and my friend was studying computer science with a view for going into networking. His Dad had gotten him a job since he was 14 doing technical work for Cisco, by the time he graduated university he had nearly 10 years experience under his belt already and walked straight into a high paying job in London. I won't deny he didn't work hard but that's an opportunity almost no-one has. Plus small things like buying him his first car, and paying for driving lessons also helped. This is not a unique situation; I could give several examples that fit this bill for people I know.

Then there is myself - I lucked out. I chose a STEM field to go into. I struggled through university on very little; my course was very expensive in terms of materials required and whilst my parents earned slightly over 30k, which was enough to disqualify me from most ""serious"" assistance, the fact my parents were still supporting my siblings meant I got little financial aid from home.

Still, I graduated, and started applying all over the country for work. I wasn't fussed over where I worked, but the nature of my profession did mean that about 60% of the jobs were in the South-East. I lucked out and got an interview in Surrey about 3 months after graduating. The pay was low for the area, but it was a job that was actually the profession I wanted to go into. I got offered it and I took it. I borrowed a one-time loan from my parents of £2,000 (they had a flexible mortgage and they took the money from there to loan me), and used that to move to the area. I am still repaying my parents for the loan as they cannot afford to just give it to me.

I never had the money to drive  - I worked 3 retail jobs from 16-18 which I used to fund my travel to school on the bus and some extra-curricular activities which was a contributing factor to me getting into my university. So I had to move into a flat that was within cycling distance. I shared and it was manageable, though I made little in the way of savings.

Then through a series of events, my housing situation fell through. I had less than 4 weeks to secure new housing, whilst still working my job. I failed in finding a new flatshare - I was only 21, and people were turning me away because of my age. I used all of my savings and moved to a town 30 miles away where I could afford a small flat on my own wage. I used all of my savings on the moving fees and was left with little. My commute is about 3 hours a day, and involves a 10km cycle now. My rent + travel is about 80% of my wage, and it is hard, but at least I have the step in the door for moving up the career ladder, past where my parents ever made it.

Then I had an accident, was in hospital for a few days unable to walk, so my girlfriend got me a serious e-cig - big fat battery, big fat vaping bit, and some very high-nicotine content liquid - which I sneaked puffs of while in the ward (luckily I was the only person there). 

That was more than a year ago and I've not touched tobacco since. I've been reducing the nicotine content too and hopefully will be nicotine free in a few months. 

In fact now, to me, it's better than smoking and I would never even consider a cigarette again. I even refused a bifter last night because it was made with a cigarette.

I'm sure it's not for everyone, but as ""the smoking guy"" who everyone thought would never quit, I assure you there's vaping kit out there that is just as - or even more - satisfying.

Now Uber have come in and tried to solve those problems and, quelle surprise, the people who were more than happy with the shoddy status quo have a problem with it. 

Uber is not the first taxi or private hire service in the UK (and it's important to distinguish the way Uber works as a regulated taxi service in the UK to it's ""ridesharing"" service elsewhere in the world). It is just fixing what the taxi industry has been doing wrong for so many years.

Not so much of a delusion but the double standard which is evident.

I admit that his off the field antics have been uncalled for.

But why does the sub think it is okay that we wait on Daniel especially when he did return from his previous injury he was quite selfish.

Not only that but how can we keep expecting more from an injured player than a player who should be given a chance to play.

Like Rodgers, many here think Daniel will help solve our goal scoring woes when in fact there is no certainty on how long he will be fit or will he continue with his abysmal performances before he got injured again. Yet, I am the one who is deluded.

He will not be a doctor or engineer. But he never wanted to be anyway. He, in fact, had no clear idea what he really wanted to do. His only goal has been to NOT accumulate the debts others have by going to college.

He is 23, debt free, and earning enough to live on. If he becomes a general manager (store manager) as he wishes, his salary will be around 120k usd by age 30, with no debt. Not counting performance bonuses.

This is not ideal, compared with my own youth. But it is better than many or most of his peers who are in college or will be shortly.

Please read the sidebar rules before posting. Especially, and in addition:

* All top level posts must be a question. All questions must be genuine and asked in good faith or will be removed.

Or extending SureStart, giving **mothers** the power and confidence to transform their own lives and transform their children’s lives for years to come?

A big chunk of your post is fairly disingenuous, but this bit I take special exception to for its false equivalence. First, not everybody using the term SJW is using it a derogatory term for a feminist. In fact, those people are generally the unpleasant minority you find in all subreddits - the term SJW is used to demarcate the line between actual legitimate activists and idiots that mouth off about things they don't really understand or care about to make themselves feel superior and, in extreme cases, attempt to bully other people into going along with their ideologies. 



Second, the assertion that r/tumblrinaction exists *solely* to mock feminists is demonstrably false (just visit it ffs) - for the most part it mocks zealots, idiots and hypocrites, an approach Reddit generally doesn't have a problem with (as long as none of them happen to be feminists apparently).

Some top Labour figures, including Liz Kendall, have voiced support for creating a new ""English Labour Party"" within Labour, analogous to Scottish Labour. What is your view on this?

If you don't support the idea, what's your reason?

My main criticism of the idea is that I can't imagine *what it would actually do*, and what role the hypothetical ""English Labour Leader"" would have in comparison to the main party leadership.

&gt;attempt to keep the same standard of living as to when I was a student

This is a nice way to look at things, and one I had never thought of before. As students we got so much for free, such as tax breaks,, student discounts, etc. This is definitely something I will consider.

I like the idea of a travel/holiday motivation. A road trip. That is a nice idea thank you, and one that will go on my savings list immediately.

&gt;you're not owed anything mearly for completing University

I fully understand that, but I feel University is oversold, especially a 5 year degree. If I had continued working on a farm as soon as I left high school, I would be around £50-70k better off right now. I have worked hard to ensure I have no debt, never have, but yeah I am starting to see this is a problem with myself not my money lol. I think the quote is 'comparison is the thief of joy'.

&gt; Pastor McConnell's prosecution is one of a growing number of examples in which British authorities — who routinely ignore incendiary speech by Muslim extremists — are using hate speech laws to silence Christians.

No, it's using hate-speech laws to silence hate-speech.

What did he say?

&gt; ""The Muslim religion was created many hundreds of years after Christ. Mohammed, was born in 570.
But Muslims believe that Islam is the true religion, dating back to Adam, and that the biblical Patriarchs were all
Muslims, including Noah and Abraham and Moses, and even our Lord Jesus Christ.

&gt; ""To judge by some of what I have heard in the past few months, you would think that Islam was little more than
a variation of Christianity and Judaism. Not so. Islam's ideas about God, about humanity, about salvation are
vastly different from the teachings of the Holy Scriptures. Islam is heathen. Islam is satanic. Islam is a doctrine
spawned in Hell.""

Though I'm not religious, I was almost with him up until those last two sentences.

&gt; Islam is satanic. Islam is a doctrine spawned in Hell.

Maybe it's just heavy with symbolism and you're supposed to read between the lines. As a non-believer I can dismiss all that talk of Hell and Satan as just over-wrought metaphor.

But to a believer, that must be deeply hurtful. Maybe it's debatable whether it deserves to qualify as hate-speech; but to use language like that, what else underlies it except hate? What could be the intent of it, except to make other people hate?

I've never got why in so many cities private hire cabs seem so inconspicuous. That's one of the few things I think Leeds City Council actually does very well.

Many moons back there was an incident when a girl on a night out got into a fake cab and, sad to say, it didn't end well. Since then, you can't help but spot a local minicab.

Every private hire cab has the cab firm logo and driver licence plate on the door and boot, with windscreen banners at the front and back. I'm amazed that other cities don't do something similar.

null,null,IanCal,eng-manchester,Manchester - City of Science,null,"&gt; But let's move past the case study issue, as we clearly disagree on this

I think the disagreement may be based very heavily on how you see the context of the story. As a case study published by the DWP, I agree it's wrong, but I see it as simply an example to help explain basic rules (based on where it was published). I won't belabour this point though, it's not too important and the rest of the discussion I think is more interesting and actually the part that harms people.

&gt; In terms of your questions about 'Should there be sanctions?', those are good questions, but they don't take into account the level of perversity and inconsistency with which the 'invalid' sanctions are applied and then defended and the difficulty of appealing against them.

I intended to cover that in the invalid section, but it is worth stressing that point (the 'invalid' sanctions [can't think of a better phrase] cause a huge amount of harm to people). More abstractly for any designed system it's worth considering a few basic parts:

1. Does it work? Does it achieve the aims?

2. Is it worth the cost of running it?

3. What problems does it cause?

4. Are the problems it causes outweighed by the benefits?

While it seems unfeeling to consider 1 and 2 first, that's only because 3 is difficult to quantify and 4 is always highly debatable, and we may not actually need to answer them at all. If the system fails 1 and fails 2 because it costs money, then 3 &amp; 4 are essentially irrelevant because the system should be stopped immediately even if it causes no problems.

I can easily see sanctions failing 1 &amp; 2. There were a fair amount of sanctions but also a huge number of appeals. Appeals cost money, as do the two stages before then (review and mandatory review, something like that). I expect a lot of the processes to stop ""benefits cheats"" probably fail 1 &amp; 2 as well.

Personally I think there should be more experimental trials run to determine how well things work. If it's not a vast part of the budget, why not try removing the process of sanctioning in some area and see what happens.

If we find that 1 &amp; 2 are met, then 3 &amp; 4 should be discussed. Even if it does get some amount more of people into work and is a net saving / low cost, that doesn't automatically mean it's a good idea, just that it passes the most basic checks required.

I'm in your constituency and voted for you at the last election -  I think you've done a fantastic job for Walthamstow and hope you get the Deputy Leadership nod, even if that means we see less of you around town.

Labour increased their votes by almost a million at the 2015 election, but actually lost seats. UKIP won over four million votes and only one seat. A frequent comment from non-voters was that they felt that their vote didn't matter due to safe seats and the unfairness of the FPTP system. 

My question is: how can we effectively reform the electoral system to ensure that people feel like their vote counts, and ensure that Parliament is truly representative of the electorate's voting intentions?

He's not a bad player - he's decent with the ball at his feet and can pick up good passes. But basically, he's suited to the Spanish possession game, not the high-energy game of the PL and of Poch specifically. Also he has serious confidence issues and played badly when dropped from the line up.

[A joke about cis people trying to be sympathetic towards trans people, but winding up just being annoying.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/3hfwk5/trans_max_beyond_the_tumblrdome/?sort=confidence) Literally the top comment is making fun of people who don't like gendered bathrooms, think that safe spaces are a good idea and support BLM. It's literally making fun of feminists / people who advocate for social justice with absolutely no relevance to the original post.

[A post about how, by not being actively against oppression, you are helping to perpetuate it, which is an actual, revolutionary political theory.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/3hglr6/tw_facebook_fuck_by_that_logic_im_basically/) Again, comments completely miss the point and make fun of the poster for even suggesting that they could be contributing to the problem.

[A sticker calling for the removal of gendered bathrooms.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/3hf70u/bathroom_triggering_at_university/) Comments completely ignoring issues suffered by trans people (don't have to think about it because of their cis privilege). Also, for some reason they make fun of people trying to come up with more inclusive abbreviations for different sexualities. Literally the longest one I've seen is LGBTQI+ but apparently that's too long for TiA.

[Obviously a joke, not actually a true story, about white people complaining about a few square metres of land being taken from them.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/3hi1oa/another_edition_of_swj_that_totally_happened/) First comment is literally about selling this person to human trafficking circles, what the actual fuck?

There is theological grounding for saying that other faiths are the work of evil, designed to seduce people away from the way of Christ.

Secondly, instead of going onto her policies she just kept pitching less-than-subtle attacks on Corbyn when she kept going on about heart and head, and 'some people think'.

null,null,livingfortoday,null,null,null,"The idea, I believe, is that he adds extra height when defending corners. He's also the main outlet on goal kicks, where he uses his height to flick the ball on to Willian or Hazard. 

He has also scored a few very important goals, mainly headers, over the years. This can't be denied.

These strengths are now far outweighed by his weaknesses unfortunately. His passing is very poor and uncreative, he can't cross and his movement is predictable. Not only that but when he attacks he leaves massive gaps in defence which he doesn't have the pace to get back and fix. Playing Ivanovic and Cahill on the same side of the defence causes massive problems with quick passing and transition from defence to attack. Just look at how many times Cahill runs himself into trouble before running to the side line and hoofing the ball forward, turning over possession. It's a real problem.

The benefits of Ivanovic scoring the occasional goal are far outweighed by the negatives in terms of his general attacking play. These negatives are prevalent in nearly all games, where teams will allow Ivan all the space he wants on the right because they know he's a black hole for possession play and quick movement. This allows them to focus more on pressuring Fabregas and Hazard. 

Releasing Azpi onto the right would be beneficial to the team due to his speed and better passing ability. It wil allow for more dangerous overlapping runs and he has the stamina to get back to deal with counter attacks. It would be the same with Baba on the left. 

The team may lose a little in terms of defending to begin with but I feel it's vital that Chelsea moves on from the current defensive philosophy to one that allows for more balance between attack and defence.

You might be lucky and find a place, but the majority of decent apartments get taken within a couple of weeks of being on the market. From personal experience, three years ago I was looking for apartments to move into two months later. At least three separate agents told me to contact them nearer the time, as there was no way to find something that far in advance. When I did find a place, it was less than two weeks before we moved in.

I would suggest to just enjoy your holiday; I think it would be very hard to find an apartment with more than two months before you plan to move in and even if you did, you would likely have to pay rent straight away.

As for papers, it depends on the agency but usually you will require:

 * Proof of employment

 * Some for of guarantor (but your proof of employment might be enough!)

 * Proof of money in the bank

 * The security deposit + agency fees + one (or two) months rent upfront

 * Personal references from previous landlords


If you have all this, it is realistic to sign a contract in a day (provided you can send them the money right away). Finding the right place, however, might take a bit longer than a week.

null,null,harblstuff,irish,Ireland,null,"The fate of the club game in Ireland is not different, but the IRFU were ruthless in the beginning at it has paid dividends. 

The AIL used to have regular attendances of 5-10,000. Then they laid the professional province structure over the clubs and all the clubs fed into this system and their respective teams. All Ireland match day team sheets are released with the players club, not province. 

Even in 2000 AIL matches still had a higher attendance than Leinster matches, which barely managed to attract 500. In 2008 82,500 people packed into Croke Park to see Leinster vs Munster and each province now has a strong identity. 

Local rivalries still exist, the semi pro AIL is important to die hard rugby fans and players, but everyone bends the knee to the professional system which trumps all.

The Welsh approach in my opinion was not as efficient or as effective as the Irish, our provinces are subsidiaries of the IRFU, whereas the Welsh regions are privately owned, yet must bow to the WRU which creates animosity. 

Having 10 teams enter the Celtic League made it a headache, difficult to concentrate success. The emotional connection was strong and making every team think they had a shot at a professional league made it difficult to convince them that regionalisation was a good idea. 

They have taken 20 years to finally make Region 'A' sides for player development and set up a proper system for clubs to feed players into the professional set up. This has allowed clubs to gain a much stronger foothold and influence in the system. 

It's nice to see 15-20,000 people attend an AIL final, but to be honest, I don't really care. The League of Ireland for soccer has a very disperse club system, which is one of the reasons why soccer is failing in Ireland. Too many clubs, too little interest, no money. If we had tried to make the AIL professional rugby would be dead in Ireland. 

*tl;dr: Ireland and Wales are similar but different, one was ruthless in its treatment of the prestigious club game the other was quite respectful towards it. Wales is moving ever closer to Ireland's system (but cannot and never will be a copy of it) but the power of the clubs and the private nature of the regions as opposed to Ireland's subsidiary nature of the provinces means the WRU has less control and more headaches (such a the ""Welsh civil war"" which recently took place)*",null,0,null,1439981012,null,null,1439981227,0,cu8433p,null,t3_3hg58s,null,null,null,t1_cu7hzv0,null,null,null,1441340383,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Really polytechnics and unis should have been kept seperate (e.g. as they are in Germany) to keep applied and vocational skills easily accessible and affordable to those who want certification and to stop graduate job market saturation.

I am a recent (2 years ago) computer science graduate from one of the top universities in the UK. Many of my university colleagues throughout their studies have not learnt to programme - the most important skill covered on many modules. Other modules were often too abstract as well. 

Some students could memorize rules and answers/patterns and finished with 1st, even when such rules could be rebuild with little effort once you grasped the core idea. Often no understanding was needed, just words and patterns. Myself, occasionally doubting my abilities to break down abstract concepts, took this path. Majority did not graduate. From those who graduated with good grades, many could not get programming jobs, even though this is IT where job market is only growing. 

The quality of education is for us, students, the grade/score more often than not. The ambitious with great background students can play a havoc with your self esteem. Such attitude is sad and takes away most of what education should mean. These 'memorizes' often worked very hard. Working hard with little yields changes your self-perception. I want to highlight that low self-esteem makes you a terrible procrastinator who does not believe any more that the effort leads anywhere. Consequences follow feeding the vicious cycle. 

Some of my friends who dropped out or struggled with these problems were displaying intelligence traits. I did not believe once that they could not, but I knew they believed they could not.

I've done the same. And I'm starting to feel normal again now...

About a month ago. Just wanted to get out of the house so I took the bike to a local bike dealer, just to browse. It started raining as I got onto the ring road (dick to get back home from where I was. Traffic lights, roundabouts and one way streets. And I could actually see the flat!). It started raining. I thought ""It's fine, plenty of people can ride in the rain just fine."" So my jeans (I know) started to get wet.

Then the first pin prick of cold found the family heirlooms. I was done. Could barely concentrate. Got to the dealership, closed. So stood in the now pouring down rain, getting progressively wetter. Decided to go back home. Got lost (one way out of the junction and forgot where I was). Eventually went back the right way past the pub, up to the island. Little bit twitchy (tyre and bum). Up to the lights. Up to the next island. Left it way too late to brake. Started to use back brake, rear end slide. Ooooh balls. Braked again front and rear together.

I remember thinking ""It feels like falling off a push-bike"" then I was rolling down the road. Bike had fell on the left hand side with me under it, so no damage. Then it dug in and flipped over, sending me over the top and down the road, while it pretty much stayed still. I got focus back while rolling and rolled a couple more times to dissipate the energy. People started calling from their cars asking me if I was alright, but I was just sort of dazed. A young man came out and helped me get the bike stood up and found my front brake lever. Then I just pushed it home.

I still haven't rode in the wet yet. But I've got proper bike trousers now, and a brand new, better fitting helmet.

Got my first A2 lesson tomorrow, and it might be raining...",null,0,null,1439981702,null,null,false,0,cu849t9,null,t3_3hdx8g,null,null,null,t3_3hdx8g,null,null,null,1441340471,null,1,null,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,1,null

As someone who was an organiser at the last election, I'm really interested in your ideas for improving the way we canvass, collect data and act on it. At the last election we prioritised quantity of contact over quality- the much touted 5 million conversations usually boiled down to just the three ID questions and maybe a question about issues. 

We need to change that to have actual policy discussions where we can persuade and inform as well as just ID. The big challenge for this is most members won't doorstep canvass at all, and those that do are often reluctant. It is usually by saying ""you don't have to be an expert on policy"" and pointing out the simplicity of the script you actually get them to do things, but if we aim to have proper long discussions on the doorstep we will require both a larger number of activists willing to knock on doors and for these activists to be confident and informed enough to actually have those conversations and debates.

There is a vast difference between the two.

null,null,harblstuff,irish,Ireland,null,"&gt; The thing that made provincial rugby work in Ireland is provinces are a real thing and the provincial championship was a real thing. People went and watched provincial rugby (cue Munster-All Blacks reference) before professionalism and it didn't take a genius to figure out that was a more sustainable system than club rugby. There's no way Limerick would have been able to sustain Shannon, Young Munster, and Garryowen as professional clubs.

No. This is claimed by every non Irish person, it holds no water. 

The provinces were a prestige team and no one ever cared about them. Leinster played the All Blacks in the 70s but no one cared then and no one cares now, the only reason why Munster playing the All Blacks is ever mentioned is because they're the only team to have beaten them.

Outside of that one match there is zero significance in the history of Irish rugby for Leinster, Munster or Ulster. 

I don't know how or why you just ignored my very important point that no one cared about Leinster even in 2000, it meant nothing. If you would've said you were a Leinster fan before 2001-3 people would have looked at you as if you had two heads. 

The only time provinces have ever been relevant in Ireland was the mid 2000s in rugby. Before professionalism mentioning 'provincial' teams made very little sense to all but a few. 

Edit: The provinces meant so little even up to the mid 2000s that people outside of Dublin, despite being from Leinster, happily supported Munster. *Because provinces meant nothing even in the beginning of the professional era, let alone even before*

&gt;In Wales the difficulty was there are more big clubs than spots available. The WRU wanted four teams, but Neath, Bridgend and Pontypridd weren't interested. They should have just gone with the Gang of Six recommendations from a few years earlier and seen what happened, but they wanted regional rugby. All it's done is make Welsh teams uncompetitive, broke, and piss off a whole bunch of fans. Lots of people walked away and have never come back.

What makes them broke is that Wales has a population the same size as Leinster and yet thinks it can sustain four clubs, or in your case, more than four. It thins out the player base, it thins out the fan base. One of the biggest problems for Welsh regional rugby was no team in the north. Travel distances are mental in Wales.

All the issues you mentioned: suicide, workplace deaths, child custody, sentencing inequalities, these all exist because of a certain expectation of what a man should be like.

Men are expected to fit into the role of 'breadwinner' of the household, and when they fall short of that expectation, many turn to suicide. Society actively discourages women from taking part in manual labour, which is where most workplace deaths occur. Because of this disparity, of course men will suffer from more workplace deaths than women by simple fact that there are more men in dangerous areas of work.

Child custody; women are expected to fit in the gender role of 'housewife', they are expected to stay at home and care for the children.

Well we're taking a gamble that we won't die before retirement. If you spend instead of saving for retirement, you're basically betting very heavily that you'll die early. Statistical tables mean you're betting you're in the ~9% who die before 60 if male and 6% who die before then if female (knock off another 1% since you're in the 99% that reached 21). If you meet this you have an expected lifespan of another 22-25 years. And that's for people hitting 60 *now*, life expectancies have generally gone up.

First I'd like to say welcome to the subreddit! Home to many great  arguments about the future of our party. These questions are mine and my friends, who can't make it today - but she's a big fan! I must admit I am currently split between you and Tom. My questions are:

1) With the coming transition of low-skilled labour, such as truckers and taxi drivers, to automated control within the next decade, how do you plan on tackling mass worker-displacement?

2) If elected deputy, do you plan on expanding worker co-ops as a means of empowering communities? Studies have suggested:

&gt; The pay ratio between the highest- and lowest-paid worker-owners in cooperatives is between 3 to 1 and 5 to 1, that compares with a ratio of roughly 600 to 1 in traditional corporations.

This is a stark contrast to Britain today, with some of the highest income inequality in the world.

3) how do you plan on working with corbyn, whether he wins or loses? He will undoubtedly have a massive proportion of membership behind him, and the current tactic of slandering him and his supporters I feel shows clear disdain from mps towards members.

4) How do you plan on maintaining the current momentum of party membership and grassroots activism that has occurred since the election?

5) Do you support a change in the electoral system from FPTP? It has clearly run its purpose as seen in this election.

Thanks for your time! I hope you continue to participate in the subreddit after the AMA. It would be good to get consistent engagement from MPs on the subreddit.

I'm under the impression (maybe incorrectly) that SA oil production is currently income neutral, i.e. just about covers day to day costs, such that overall they're selling at a loss (if you take into account loss of oil reserves and cost of infrastructure, etc). 

If that's the case then it may well be in the best interests of SA for longer term economic and geopolitical reasons, but it's certainly an unusual strategy. Right now they could get more income by slashing production and selling a little oil at a much higher price, fracking will likely fizzle out in a few years and SA would be sitting on one of the few remaining large reserves. There's an argument that they're concerned about the rise of renewable energy and global warming mitigation policies, so want to get as much income early as possible, but that only makes sense if they plan to crush the sub $50 oil industry and then start cutting supply to push the price back up, say in 3-4 years time.",null,0,null,1439983597,null,null,false,0,cu84tkv,null,t3_3hhwuj,null,null,null,t1_cu82jno,null,null,null,1441340729,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

My son will be age 30 with 120k annual salary plus bonuses, and debt free. Additionally, he already owns a home with about 300k equity. It was an inheritance from when he was 9 years old, and we have spent the last 18 years or so paying it off for him.

&gt;Let me take this argument head on. Real Tories want to destroy trade unions and rights at work, abolish student grants, cut working tax credits for the low paid, and slash the role of the state for ideological reasons – not reform it so it is fit for the future. This is a huge mistake.

&gt;But calling ideas from people who have been members of the Labour party for decades “Tory” has become a term of abuse that is a substitute for being forced to think. And the real problem with this accusation is not its absurdity but the danger it poses for our Party.

&gt;Labour must change how we apply our values as the world around us changes. When we don’t do that, we atrophy. Dismissing new thinking as Tory or a pale imitation of being Tory hems us in and stops us from doing the necessary thinking to win again.

Speaking to the BBC, al-Wazzan said: ""Since the Islamic State took over, it [Mosul] has become the most peaceful city in the world.""

My motivation was to gain skills to be a programmer and become employable, and it was the only path I could take. The only alternative was to continue working as a labour in construction. 

I was insecure about my past and that fuelled me to take the idea of education very seriously. Worked hard every summer, caught up with maths and other subjects, finished with strong first, scored internships and open source projects. I landed a job right after uni and was slightly flattered by the attention.

My CLP is Harrogate and Knaresborough, which has been solidly Tory since 1950 except between 1997 and 2010 (when it was Lib Dem under now-Lord Willis).  It's small, but has very passionate members (one of whom being a newly elected town councillor!), and the lack of GE success means it's more focused on local issues than being part of a political machine.

In 2015, though we fielded a good candidate and increased both votes and share, we were beaten to 4th by UKIP.  Meanwhile, the local MP is shooting up the Tory political machine, and is now a junior minister for transport.

_In your vision for Labour, what is the role of CLPs stuck in safe Tory/LD seats, who it seems in 2015 were largely treated as extra campaigners for marginal seats?_  It's unrealistic to pump resources into ‘unwinnable’ seats, but it's disheartening to be told more or less ‘don't bother campaigning in your seat, you can't win it, come to Pudsey instead’, when your CLP could be tapping into grassroots and local affairs.

null,null,IScreechYourWeight,null,null,null,"Agreed. 

I did a countryside management ""degree"" over a decade ago. Respectable old university, too, though hardly top of the league. 

Looking back on it, the course aimed at being somewhere between academic / scientific / practical - which was what attracted me to it I suppose. The result was that it was none of those. Not nearly enough academic rigour, and no practical skills whatsoever. 

So I left after three years, clutching my degree, but unable to perform any practical function in the countryside, and (thank god I realised this!) incompetent to supervise anybody *elses* work. 

I spent the next few years in extremely low-paid jobs getting the practical experience I needed to be anyfuckingusewhatsoever. 

Just think for a minute about the number of jobs - useful roles in society - where a *degree* in countryside management, as opposed to practical skills, is of any real use.

It's a tiny number, and includes policy makers, regulatory officials, managers of larger firms and so on. I've met, and worked with, an awful lot of these in the intervening years, and can assure you that the ones who are guaranteed to be 100% piss-useless are those that have a good degree, a steeply-sloping career trajectory, and no years of practical, working-all-winter-in-the-rain experience. 

On the positive side, there are some good ones. Some have degrees - often achieved as mature students, or with good year-long work placements (I'm a fan of those I'll admit, I've seen many good people emerge from those). But by the time people *become* any good, and useful, their degree doesn't matter a damn. 

I'm genuinely not saying this out of resentment at people who've got good careers, without ever getting their hands dirty. I really don't care, except that those with clean fingernails, so to speak, are fairly reliably fairly useless. 

And still we encourage everyone to university! And I can see why - it's a vicious circle. You need a bloody masters degree now for entry level stuff with some government orgs, and these are jobs which quite frankly would be perfect for a moderately bright 16 year old with a C or above in maths who wasn't afraid of hard work. Give me one of those over a gap-year-befuddled graduate any day.

I would disagree, and this goes back to the guilt by association point. Just because he engages with people who have some bad beliefs, doesn't mean he shares those beliefs. Clearly he's a critic of Israel, and that's fine, but it's not anti-Semitic.

The idea that a person in a political capacity, could avoid encountering anti-Semites, while engaging with the issue, is going to be very difficult, because there are a great many people who are anti-Semitic, and they are outspoken on the Israel/Palestine situation. 

As for defending certain people, that's obviously highly dependent on the context. Kicking someone out of the country for being anti-Semitic, is arguably an over-reaction.

If Rodgers doesn't rate Sakho, which it's starting to appear that he doesn't, combined with his iffy injury record and **most importantly** *if* the lad wants to leave for regular football, then I think we should consider selling him next summer (providing we get £15m+, and have already signed a replacement of equal or better ability).

Personally I love Sakho. On and off the field he's what we need, it's so frustrating to see him being omitted from squads, essentially placing him behind Kolo Toure in the pecking order. But at the end of the day, competition for places is what brings out the best in the best players. Seeing Moreno come out and say he'll fight for his place in the media, then put in that tidy performance in his Bournemouth cameo makes me think he'll do well.

NOBODY is claiming that he's antisemitic because he's a critic of Israel.

&gt;The idea that a person in a political capacity, could avoid encountering anti-Semites, while engaging with the issue, is going to be very difficult, because there are a great many people who are anti-Semitic, and they are outspoken on the Israel/Palestine situation.

Perhaps that tells you something about their cause?  

There's no excuse.  If a politician wants to defend a cause in which many of the people supporting the cause are bigots, then it's that politician's duty to clearly and unambiguously distance himself from the bigotry.

And never threaten anything you aren't actually prepared to do (if you are prepared to march him into Tesco and then fair enough, when we caught one of ours stealing just having me drive him to the supermarket car park was enough to have him in tears), they're not stupid and the next time you threaten something they'll know you wont carry through on it.

There is some evidence to suggest E-cigarettes are slightly more harmful than nothing at all.

&gt;The BMA cites studies that demonstrate ""passive vaping"", does occur – mainly from the inhalation of propylene glycol vapour emitted by e-cigarette smokers – and can cause irritation of the throat. 

Only an idiot would argue on current evidence that e-cigarettes are more harmful than smoking. But there is some evidence to suggest that they can cause mild irritation, especially in those with pre existing conditions like asthma. The retort to this statement is it is the same chemical used in food sweeteners, so we can eat that and it is harmful so why is it bad now? You don't inhale your food, the concentrations are entirely different when you eat something and the amount you inhale than the amount you find in these e-cigarettes. Evidence is not conclusive yet but there is some evidence to suggest that it it is not incredibly harmful for some people, but it can irritate others and is actually why they are banned at some English hospitals.

To reply to /u/El_Nombre_Occupado
The thing about formaldehyde is valid to a point, but the important to think is that when you compare them with normal cigarettes they are far less carcinogenic. Tobacco smoke contains far more carcinogens so if you compare the 2, there is really no contest.

Also living in a polluted area can raise the incidence of respiratory conditions so small little variances in risk like this can be seen in everyday life and may be more difficult to really go after as ""serious"" risk factors.

null,null,IScreechYourWeight,null,null,null,"I would suggest north Wales - Snowdonia specifically, and the Bettws y Coed area if you like forests and lakes. Trains from Euston; change at Llandudno for Blaenau Ffestiniog. Nice journey, too, once you're past Brum. 

If you can imagine a small-scale version of the lake district with more forests, far fewer tourists, and bigger / quieter mountains, you've pretty much got it. 

Don't go up Snowdon. It's like standing at Tottenham Court Road tube when you get to the top nowadays. Go up Moel Siabod instead: a few miles away; good views *of* Snowdon, and there'll probably be no more than five or six other people up there with you. 

There are loads of campsites in this area. Look for the ones within walking distance of a pub. If you want mountains, camp at the site near Ogwen Cottage. You can climb Tryfan and the Glyders one day; and across the road to the Carneddau the next day. 

Generally (whole of UK now) look for campsites run by farmers, rather than the Forestry Commission, which is always a five-star rip off in my experience. Probably fine if you've got a caravan, a new-ish car (probably a Rover), five kids and no concept of value for money. 

Little farmer-run campsites are great, when you're away from the main tourist hotspots. Usually super cheap, the other campers tend to be friendly. Ask them for tips about other sites, you'll get loads of advice. 

Rough camping is *fine* providing you're not an arse. I.e. don't leave litter; don't start fires in wooded areas; try reasonably hard not to annoy anyone.  Ask first if you're near a farm / village and likely to get booted off. I used to rough-camp on National Trust land (it's helpfully marked on OS maps) reasoning, what's the worst *they're* going to do? Throw a tea towel at me?

[Enoch Powell started the stream of Asian NHS workers that everyone loves to go on about.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvAWO9jpxoE) He certainly wasn't against all immigration. He was against concentrated, rapid, and large scale immigration:

&gt; Of course, it will not be evenly distributed from Margate to Aberystwyth and from Penzance to Aberdeen. Whole areas, towns and parts of towns across England will be occupied by sections of the immigrant and immigrant-descended population.

He (rightly) feared communalism where society would break into groups with strong internal bonds but weak bonds to other groups in society. He believed this would happen regardless of race.

&gt; If the immigrants were Germans or Russians, their colour would be approximately the same as ours, but the problems which would be created and the change which could be brought about by a large introduction of a bloc of Germans or Russians into five areas in this country would be as serious – and in some respects more serious – than could follow from an introduction of a similar number of West Indians or Pakistanis.

All the racist content of the Rivers of Blood speech (black man having the whip hand over the white man etc) were quotes from his constituents. He was pointing out that racial tension existed and that he couldn't shrug his shoulders and pretend it didn't exist.

null,null,Fuck_the_DWP,null,null,null,"Currently in my third week of a 13 week sanction so I'll give a brief overview of how it's affected me. Using a throwaway as a friend knows my main account. 

Worked almost consistently since leaving school, always considered myself relatively normal had some issues with mental health but normally after a few months of popping pills and counseling eventually broke out of it to become functional enough to handle day to day life.
 Lost my last job had to sign on and was sanctioned for missing an appointment. I was at the jobcentre at the alloted time I had arrived 15 minutes before and sat on the seats waiting to be called, I was unaware the seating had been rearranged since my last visit so my advisor was now based in a different part of the building so when they called my name I didn't answer because I was waiting in the area they always were previously. So even though I was in the building I was classed as a no show inspite the fact I was there. Attempted an appeal but the sanction was upheld. 

Week 1: wasn't too bad as I had been buying tinned food, pasta, rice etc fortnightly so before the sanction I was always able to eat something at least twice a day. Pawned my hifi at cash converters for £20 which covered things like toilet roll, toothpaste, milk, bread, tobacco and abit of gas and electricity. 

Week 2: down to just a bag of rice and condiments have a bowl at lunch and another for tea, I'm back in cash converters with laptop, I asked for £80 but due to it being a few years old and knowing I was desperate they said best they can do is £35 which I take. Stock up on porridge, pasta, rice beans etc. Novelty of having food means I got carried away and started eating 3 times a day this back fired as I was almost out of food by the following week. 

Week 3: the third week of sanction started Thursday just gone. Back to eating once a day, alternate between porridge and rice for variety. I leave my bedsit about 1am if it's not  raining and head into the city centre to raid cigarette tab ends from pub ashtrays. I do this for two reasons, partly I'm addicted to nicotine but mostly smoking helps with the hunger pangs. Tried to pawn in my phone but due to scratches they wouldn't accept which is a catch 22 situation as it's my only means of entertainment and communication. This week I also become one of those ""have you got 50p for the bus mate"" people. Managed to get about £4 over last few days but the embarrassment of asking is still strong. 

Im quickly approaching my fourth week and rather than begging which I'm not cut out for I'm trying to build up the courage to go out stealing. Not really looking forward to it as I fucking hate theifs, but there are a few allotments about so I'm trying to justify taking a potato from one tomatoes from another and so on.

 To summarise sanctions are fucking shit. I try not to wish bad things on people but I would do some terrible things to those people who put me and others through situations like this. Benefits are meant to be a safety net so people don't end up in situations like this. How can anyone justify punishing people with hunger. 

Edit: I tried to reply to this message but i think I'm still getting alot of messages from people who have only read this one so I feel I have to edit this one for visibility. 

I posted this message to vent about my frustration, I wasn't expecting this to get as much attention as it has, and I wasn't expecting the level of generosity in advice, and certainly not of financial assistance. 

While this message was on less than a hundred Upvotes I accepted the first few offers and received almost £100 went and immediately went and did some shopping. 

Im now sat with a food in my stomach and food in my cupboards and I'm still receiving offers of help. My situation is shitty but for the next few weeks or so it's looking alot better. 

If you have already pm'd me or wanted to, please can you instead donate the food or money you were willing to offer me to a cause that helps people eat who might not be able to. It's only a few hours ago that I was hungry and didn't know how I was going to manage. I posted a comment on reddit and now when I open my fridge there is food in it. I'd rather your generosity helped lots of people for a for a few days than just me for alot of days. Honestly this website is amazing. 

2nd edit: I've got alot of messages and found out this is on r/bestof so just want to add some things. 

I posted this comment to share my experience I wasn't expecting it to blow up like this and I didnt expect so many people to offer to help out. I didnt post it for the Internet points and it never occured to me that it would generate the response it did. On my main account I often post and it gets no attention and wasn't expecting this to be any different, I used a throwaway because someone IRL knows my account and I'm embarrassed of my current situation so didn't want to risk them seeing it. I think alot of people are under the impression I had an ulterior motive in posting this but after accepting a few offers I started sending people saying thanks but I couldn't accept even before I'd made my first edit. Hopefully someone will confirm that. 

I have no qualifications and a patchy work history and when applying for minimum wage jobs with 30+ applicants I'm well aware I'm probably not going to be the first choice. I don't blame anyone for situation and I don't expect something for nothing. Im applying for jobs everyday and the job centre requires that I spend 30 hours a week searching. I have to log into their website so they can see exactly what I'm doing and when I'm doing it. Im not unemployed by choice and I'm doing everything I can to change my situation. 

Im still getting offers and I appreciate  it but I can't accept. Yesterday I was hungry , today I have food. Not being able to eat and not knowing when you will is an awful feeling, and there are plenty of people out there experiencing it today. Please help them instead, their story won't get as much attention but they need it more than I do.  Thanks.

Most people regard improvement as either increased competition (and therefore interest) or better players/teams (money being the key to buying/retaining players).

On the latter people talk about the TV deal but there's little in the interests of the TV money to bid up the SPL package costs. Such is the convenience / attraction of the Premiership and pay TV having near exclusivity of golf, tennis, club rugby, NFL... a good proportion of Scottish households open to the idea of paying for sport will subscribe for something else. Those who choose BT sport vs Sky purely on the basis of Scottish football coverage are probably thought to be a small number. BT might feel it lands more Scottish subscribers by getting hold of the CL than additional SPL games. 

I think it's no coincidence both Sky and BT are happy to take some games at a cheap price, feeling bidding more for exclusivity doesn't actually hurt the other or benefit themselves. I think also population size etc are bad measures, lots of the biggest fans in Scottish football prefer not to watch the other teams - e.g. Celtic supporters choosing to spend 2 hours watching Rangers. Unless there's a real title race or a prospect of an upset I don't think the audience matches the general level of interest in the game up here.

Scottish football in theory should really pursue the former and look at how they can manufacture a league structure that lets any team who put a good enough squad together take a run at the SPL. I think a big league with more ""easy"" games and fewer top-6 play-offs is a good start, if there was any way to restrict the January transfer window that could make a difference but I guess they can't.

I honestly think nothing can be done, there's been a paradigm shift in football in the last 5-10 years towards a group of, effectively invincible, teams and that along with the EPL becoming a de-facto world league are like two black holes consuming everything else year on year.

The better news is it'll only be a few years before the next paradigm change in European football of some form which might help us. By then you'd expect each of Juventus, PSG and Bayern will have all won 5+ back to back titles and surely there's no way the status quo will allow them to march on to double figures.

Whilst at school no one ever told me about apprenticeship schemes, they pushed the idea of higher education or the job market, that's it.

I'm actively trying to persuade some family members to think about apprenticeship schemes, instead of university. They can still have an experience of being independent, have a social life/fun (get smashed outside of work), learn and get that gold-dust thing; experience.

Why? Surely you've been paying attention to the economy and salaries?

&gt;after paying rent, bills, train tickets, car insurance, council tax and fuel alongside the daily essentials, I struggle to see how I will have a meaningful amount left to put away for savings later on in life.

You're choosing to have a car and travel by train for one. Do you need both? I've made the decision not to take my granddad's car, despite it being free to me. My dad's currently trying to tempt me by paying for MOT etc, but the question is do I need it? I'm actually relatively happy getting by on public transport, with my 16-25 railcard (free with a grad account) I get cheaper train tickets and don't have to concentrate on the driving.

It totally depends on what you're spending money on though. Yeh, if you go for a £600/month flat you're going to struggle, but that's also a silly move. I think I'm at £450 w/ utilities and council tax on a similar salary. I cook for a week, make lunches, I barely look at my account (and have made some rash buying decisions recently because I did check) and feel comfortable to eat out and party when I like. I don't actively save as much as I'd like to (going to start transferring more out so I don't have it to spend), but through pension contributions and employer matching I already have a decent amount building up.

Why save? Why work, what do you want from life? I've had a little epiphany since starting work that I'm not doing what I want to do, but that I do know what that is. So I'm making plans to ensure when I finish my grad scheme I'm in a position that I can take six months to travel and work on my self.

If your desire is to own a company then you're saving so that you have the funds to launch it or get the training you need, or survive if things go badly. If you want to own a house more than anything then you save for that. If you want to retire early you're looking for safe investments, ways to maximise the amount you can save etc. there's plenty of info around if you know what you want.",null,0,null,1439986729,null,null,1439987092,0,cu85vep,null,t3_3hkb0y,null,null,null,t3_3hkb0y,null,null,null,1441341225,null,2,null,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2,null

I got a 2:2 MEng degree in an Engineering discipline, and started having interviews almost as soon as I walked out the door and quickly got offered a graduate role.

The Computer Science people I knew all ended up working in London doing graduate programming jobs, as did my Maths friend.

My brother just completed a MSci in pure Chemistry and got interviews and a job within weeks of leaving. 

None of these are due to any connections.

The only people I know who had trouble getting graduate jobs where those who Arts degrees. Thinking about it, I don't know anyone who did English/History/Politics etc who got a decent job afterwards in fact.

The number of my uni friends in graduate jobs far outnumber the non-graduate jobs.

&gt;Why? Surely you've been paying attention to the economy and salaries? 

The reason I expect more was the fact that many graduates with a 2:1 get starting salaries closer to 40k (oil industry). I have a 1:1 and get much less, I don't know why but I thought the work you put in at Uni would relate to your salary. I guess I am a little envious in all honesty.

At twenty one you’re on top of the scrapheap
At sixteen you were top of the class
All they taught you at school
Was how to be a good worker
The system has failed you, don’t fail yourself
 
In 1983 Billy Bragg defined the threat a generation faced from Tory policies. Thirty two years later his words ring true again as we face a Government blind to the damage they are doing to the prospects of so many. Labour must offer more than opposition. We must be an alternative, fighting for a better future for all. In doing so, trade unions have a vital role to play contributing ideas, energy and experience. Following the election defeat it is vital that we do not retreat, but instead renew again our movement as the voice and vehicle for working people. We must not mourn- but organise.
 
Britain’s union movement has a proud tradition of progressive change –delivering weekends, paternity and maternity rights and equal pay. In doing so, they have helped to not just protect but create millions of jobs, saving business’s time and money, and helping the state deliver services that save lives. Despite this, the Tories are proposing the biggest crackdown on trade union rights for 30 years. We can and will oppose their agenda. But the truth is they will be able to pass this into law because they won. My campaign is about getting us ready to win again, because winning is the only way we can guarantee a Government that respects and appreciates trade unions. And with much is at stake, we must not let Matt Hancock or Francis Maude define their purpose or wait until the election to challenge their destructive agenda. Instead, we must together put productivity and pay on the political agenda, using the work many unions already do as a template of how this benefits employees, employers and the economy.
 
British productivity levels are falling far behind our competitors: as a result of Britain’s limited skills training and poor infrastructure, we produce 30% less per hour than workers in Germany or France. Or to put it another way, by Thursday lunchtime a French worker has produced as much as we do in a week. Improvements in technology are also creating a “Second Machine Age”, where many of the jobs currently done by humans are being computerised. Osborne claims to support a living wage, but the bitter reality for those on low incomes is that they will find any increase in their wages will be wiped out by cuts to tax credits - and then some. In giving with one hand but taking much more with the other he has made it more likely people will live not just in poverty, but also in financial difficulty. This is now one of the most indebted countries in the world, as families try to bridge the gap between what they earn and what they need to live through borrowing. Under Cameron’s watch, our low pay high debt economy is causing misery for millions.  
 
The Tories pretend all these issues could be solved if only people worked harder or if trade unions were weaker. We know the UK’s productivity crisis and low pay cannot be met by deregulating business and regulating unions. A smarter government would get all the players – government, business, schools, employees and trade unions – working together. At Royal Strathclyde Blindcraft Industries in Glasgow, Community Union has worked in partnership with management to develop training programmes that take physically disabled young people through a training programme which leads to a decent job. The project is supported by local government bringing the business and trade union together in partnership to make a positive difference to workers’ lives. Such collaborative approaches offer a model for how people can develop new skills and gain the confidence and security they need to move from industry to industry over the course of their careers.
 
While the Tories view trade unions as barriers to change, we know that they can be the facilitators of success in the workplace, both within sectors and at a national level too. Helping tackle poverty pay is just the start of the conversation about the role they can play in driving up productivity and supporting employees in the global economy. In the years ahead Labour must put into practice the partnerships that can help us demonstrate this is a possibility for all- both in our policy making and our campaigning. By renewing our power of collective action we can show how we would deliver fairness and prosperity for all – doing so as the biggest political organisations by far in the UK. As Labour’s next Deputy Leader ensuring our movement leads this debate from the front would be a personal priority.

Meh, I just think it's a matter of cooking enough. Make a bunch of tomato sauce (oil, onions, garlic, canned tomatoes + passata, cook it down a little + basil) and add things to keep it interesting (prawns, mince, chicken, pesto).

Or onions, carrots, peppers, cumin, chilli, paprika, garam masala, ginger, garlic + lentils + tomatoes, cook down in the over for hours + plain yogurt - curry. Salt until you can taste everything.

At its most basic (which is my food generally) cooking is just making things soft. Salt and spices are what makes things taste good, and with experience you'll know how to control texture. I presume you know all this...

I wouldn't have Chiellini and Bonucci because they look very good in Juventus' system. We play a high line and need our defenders to be explosive, ball-playing with a decent range of passing. Kompany would have looked a world-beater playing in Juventus' system last year.

You can't measure individual players attributes and decide who is better. We play differently from Juventus; unless we are going to play exactly like Juventus, then no, those players wouldn't get in our team.

My track record shows I know how to make that happen and the work i've been doing in this campaign through the workshops reflects this- I don't want to be a deputy leader in a back office in westminster, I want to be out on the frontline with our activists and supporters rebuilding our movement from the grassroots up so that we can win elections and change the country!

His example of the law profession.... Law has always been like that. My uncle is a lawyer and he's been saying for the last 30 years how law graduates all become taxi drivers.


Its about raising the level of education of a country as a whole and giving people the opportunity to aspire to any level of education they desire.


Yes this can be seen as a cheapening of the degrees handed out or a saturation of the market. But those are things we just have to deal with.


Of course a lower percentage of people will get graduate jobs. Id rather see that than trying to determine who will make a successful lawyer based on how someone does at life when they are 18.


If people want to become plumbers or work in construction that's another choice they can make. And I fully support any policy that advocates for more funding/advertising for apprenticeships. And career counseling is extremely important too.

&gt; What player(s) have impressed you most this season, why? I am leaving out the long time stars of the squad.
&gt; 
&gt; Kane- I think this is the obvious one. He plays hard and finds the back of the net. This is something we have consistently lacked.
&gt; 
&gt; Davies- Davies will never be a world class player, but I think he has the potential to be a very good player. He works well on the left side, and finally gives the team some stability at a position we have been awful at since the 2009ish version of BAE.
&gt; 
&gt; Chadli- I think Chadli is a very good winger, and we are starting to see what he is capable of. I hope Poch starts giving him more time.

I think that Kane and Chadli are probably pretty obvious at this point. I think you could argue Davies. He was relegated to a back-up role by the end of the season, and Rose cemented himself as the stater. I still favor Davies over Rose. I know people love Rose for his pace, but I feel Davies is better at defending, and I feel like our last game against Stoke showed that Davies does have something to add offensively.

&gt; What player(s) have failed to impress this season, why?
&gt; Lamela- He still looks lost out there. Makes way too many dangerous plays, and often disappears. The kid has all the talent in the world, but has yet to put it all together.

What to make of Lamela... He had a strong end to the season, and I want to love the kid. He has so much potential! He still struggles, and I think we saw that last week. I think at this point Dembele is a much better option on the wing right now. I hope that he finally puts it all together this year and we start to see him mature.

&gt; What position on the pitch is the club STRONGEST in?
&gt; Keeper- Lloris is world class, and I think Vorm is very good. Hell I would even feel confident with Friedel in the starting lineup against weaker opposition.

I think this point is still spot on.

&gt; What position on the pitch is the club WEAKEST in?
&gt; Every position but keeper. That is not to say that we don't have great players, but if one player is out injured, I don't feel we have talented depth. I think we have made quite a few mediocre choices in the transfer market, and if we are not starting our best eleven I am a little worried.

I think I was correct in this assumption last year. Our squad was exhausted by the end of the season and we still saw very little rotation in the starting 11. I think that we brought in a lot of depth this year, and I hope that we finally figured out how to bring in quality players again. The jury is still out on our new depth as we haven't seen many of our transfers in action, and the season is far too young.

&gt; What transfers OUT need to happen next summer?
&gt; Paulinho- I just don't see him as a needed piece in our squad, and he rarely sees the pitch.

Sounds about right...

&gt; The manager: Do you believe Poch has been able to implement his system yet, why?
&gt; not fully. He will need time to shape his club in a way that lets him implement his system. It may take a couple years till it is fully integrated. I think we are seeing his system in the attitude of the players, but not in tactics.

I think he still needs some time to shape the club, but I think we are closer to seeing what this team should look like if Poch is a long term solution.

&gt; Are you satisfied with Poch so far, why?
&gt; Yes. Our club is/was essentially a dumpster fire. It will take a couple years to repair all the damage and transition players. If the club does not give Poch ample time then we will continue to be a dumpster fire and a shoe in for 8th in the PL year in and year out.

We are much less of a dumpster fire now, but we still need some time/stability to put our the flames left by 'Arry and AVB.

But in my view it shouldn't; the brakes, the suspension, the engine it isn't designed for it. So don't go feeling that keeping up with traffic is where you're going wrong - because it isn't! Once you've ridden the bike for a few months and you have a good grasp of the bikes limits, you could then go thrashing it about no problem.

Furthermore, traffic will go upwards of 60mph even on a 60mph limit road. Doesn't mean you need to do the same - if they overtake you, that's on them. You're doing nothing wrong. So relax - as long as you are *safe* on the road, you're doing it right.

So back to your main question - getting confident with speed and cornering. If you feel the back tyre is slipping or loosing grip then obviously don't get your lean on in corners until you've checked it out or got it checked out by someone more in the know. Are the tyres the originals that come with the CBR125, or have they been replaced? The stock YBR tyres are absolute pants and feel the same. Upgrade to a pair of Michellin Pilots and it's like night and day! If the bike doesn't feel stable then get it checked before you try pushing it. It could save your life! If any redditors are near to you, they may very well come out and help you out here.

Cornering on a bike is done by leaning, not by turning the bars. Counter-steering, looking at where you want to go - all this can be read up about online and there are some good YouTube videos on how to corner properly. They are well worth a watch, because efficiently cornering on a bike is an art that takes years to master! I find that having the bike under some throttle (not accelerating but holding a speed) makes the bike corner much better. Also, not applying *any* brake when in the corner too - enter the corner at the right speed, hold the speed and apply acceleration at the exit of the corner to accelerate out. 

I think also you just need experience. Go out when its quiet and experiment with the bike.

However you didn't answer, and perhaps its naive of me to expect you to, how you intend on building a shadow government that is capable of promoting a united front, considering there is so much evidence that so many of Labour's most prominent MP's are so uncomfortable with the idea of Corbyn being leader.

Naturally you would want to build consensus amongst your party, but Liz Kendall, Tristram Hunt, Chukka Umunna have all expressed deep reservations about the idea of working alongside Corbyn. Do you realistically think you could create a politically powerful Cabinet without those figures? They are among Labour's most popular and media savvy politicians, do you really think you could win an election without them? 
This leadership campaign has highlighted the huge divergence of opinion within the party, more so than exists in the Tory or Lib Dem ranks, do you truly believe Jeremy Corbyn could be a unifying figure that the party needs?

EDIT: Apologies that I am asking questions about Corbyn on your AMA, but I think if you become Deputy leader (I voted for you btw) one of your biggest and most challenging tasks will be reassuring the Blairite element of the party that you can win an election.

Doesn't mean it's a better product taking into account everything else involved, especially if we are talking about what is legal as I presume it's illegal to rip for personal use again now? 

My point isn't that you're not wrong for personally thinking that image quality is king but that your argument for bluray to be a better product hinges on excluding large file sizes. Using me as an example I have no data caps, a fast connection, and hefty amounts of storage. I wouldn't blink twice at a 50 gig download of anything. 

Now not every ones like me and I'd bet if you go to any random torrent site the most popular ones for any given content are going to be compressed 720p. A bluray on image quality knocks it out of the park... presuming you actually have the option to buy a copy or are viewing on a display on which that would matter. 

It's like how there's while there is no argument flac is the best file format for the quality of music it's not the only consideration. When where and on what you're listening to it on matter just as much as it being compressed in a lossy or not.

For ANYONE now the jobs market is very uncertain, that means we have to make sure they can move between jobs as well as make sure that those who don't go to university can get ahead too. So getting more people to university is important and not enough- we hae to make sure graduates can access funding to retrain as well as those who want to set up businesses or take on apprenticeships. This may also help in my thinking- my concern is that we need a country where everyone can access the resources e.g. networks, money and training to get ahead.

They dont need any such country because they were lucky enough that they were born here and had the benefits that come with living here. This includes but is not limited to Free health care, benefits such as child benefit and free decent education which would have allowed them to become qualified or learn a trade that would mean that the economic benefit of working outweighed living off benefits. 

As you said yourself you had to make sacrifices when you started out as an accountant, you could have stayed on benefits and been £7 a week better off but with a modicum of forethoght it would be apparent that perhaps in 2 - 3 years time you would be significantly etter off in employment having gained 3 years exprience than you would still sitting on benefits.

The people you talk about having no ecoomic reason to get off benefits are those that squandered their opportunities in education because they knew that there was a welfare safety net there and they decided that using it as a hammock was a better option.

As for the argument that the romanian can work here and send money home, yes they can, same as Aussies, Kiwis and South Africans have been doing for years. I have no issue with that. But consider this, a romanina comes over to Leicestershire to clean the streets ans is paid the princely sum of lets say £1000 a month. He sends home £400 a month to build his palace back home, he is paying maybe another £100 a month in tax, this leaves him with £500 a month to cover rent, bills, food, travel etc. He is hardly living a life of luxury while he is working here. What he is doing is putting himself through a little hardship for a long term gain/benefit/improvement of his life. the same things that the unskilled unemployed brits, who dont want to clean the streets or pick fruit or whatever other menial jobs they are refusing because they consider the work below them, are refusing to do. They dont want to be worse of than when they were on benefits, not even for a short period while they gain skills and experience in the work place. They want easy jobs with high pay or they are going to stay on benefits.

in Victorian times to commemorate the lives of his seven daughters. At
that time they formed a circle of six on the Down with one pine tree in
the centre. This single tree died in the early 1900s and was removed, so
in fact there were only ever six.

These half dozen lived on through the century, braving gales and frosts
until the great storm of 1990.Miraculously, only one of the trees was
felled, but one other was badly damaged. Two new pines were later planted
as replacements but these were placed outside the old circle.
Unfortunately these didn't thrive and both eventually died and last autumn
two more of the original pines had to be felled for safety reasons.

These two were dying, infected by honey fungus, which is fatal. Bristol
City Council has planted seven new Scots pines about 30 feet away from the
dying originals and in time there should be a new Downs landmark”.",null,0,null,1439989560,null,null,false,0,cu871rd,null,t3_3hkknn,null,null,null,t1_cu86zb8,null,null,null,1441341779,null,3,null,bristol,t5_2r52c,3,null

I think you can have a society with no losers ; I think this is entirely consistent with a socialist POV as well.

What you can't have starting from our current position, is change without **relative** losses by some parties, like the top 1,000 wealthiest in Britain who have doubled their wealth since the financial crisis.

Yes, if you distributed the wealth more evenly those guys would take a bath. But they'd still be ""winners"" by any sensible measure of the term - still have a lifestyle that the masses could only aspire to. It's likely that for many their lifestyle wouldn't actually change, just a few numbers on a balance sheet somewhere.

And are they really doing better than they would in a more egalitarian society? Even the IMF acknowledges this - when the top 20% gain extra income, the economy actually contracts. Conversely, it grows the most when the lowest 20% gain extra income.

Right now right-wing policy is focused on a neoliberal agenda that is cannibalising the growth of the economy to transfer more money and power into the hands of those who already have it. That will lead to us all being losers, including the rich and the powerful. As [this (very rich) guy puts it](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/06/the-pitchforks-are-coming-for-us-plutocrats-108014.html) :

null,null,sovietuk,yorkshire,Yorkshire,null,"It's not necessarily that simple - i'm led to believe (my other half worked in the drinks industry for many years) that you can make a case that plastic bottles are actually more ecologically sound than re-using glass bottles - to clean the bottles takes some really nasty chemicals and lots of energy/water to kill off bacteria and cos you can't guarantee that no-ones put something silly in a bottle and people stick all kinds of rubbish in them. Add to that glass bottles are heavier than plastic so require more fuel to shunt around the country and take up more space on a lorry (particularly after manufacture/cleaning when they're empty - new plastic bottles are delivered to the factory as small plugs that are then heated and injected with air on site to make the final bottle). 

When i was in Norway a couple of years ago they used recycled plastic bottles (they actually felt a bit weird - heavily scuffed and surprisingly thick and heavy), but i think some companies were trying to move away from them as you had the same problem as glass - nasty cleaning chemicals and more weight. 

If you compare a plastic bottle these days with one from years back they're a lot lighter now too - thinner plastic, more clever shapes to boost strength for a thinner bottle, smaller-height caps etc :  reducing the amount of plastic can make big cost savings both on cost of material and on fuel transporting it by the millions, so theres a big incentive to companies to constantly try to improve bottles to use as little plastic as possible.

I know this. The key difference is that I'm a long termist. Many people including many of the top tier and many business people are short termists. 

&gt; this leaves him with £500 a month to cover rent, bills, food, travel etc. He is hardly living a life of luxury while he is working here. 

Not really, if you remember a thread a few days ago 60 people were living in 3 houses. 60 years ago people of my parents' generation lived three families per room in a two up two down. One of the biggest costs is rent and council tax. Apportion this between 10 or more people and the costs become insignificant.

&gt;What he is doing is putting himself through a little hardship for a long term gain/benefit/improvement of his life. the same things that the unskilled unemployed brits who dont want to clean the streets or pick fruit or whatever other menial jobs they are refusing because they consider the work below them.

Is it below them? In the 2009 apocalypse I washed plates, I cleaned bogs. Most of the time isn't a case of below them it is that in the short AND long term it makes no sense. So they don't do it. Secondly the below them thing is something which was instilled by the previous generation. If you don't do X (school, college university etc) you'll end up working in Mc'ds or cleaning toilets. Now we have a huge swath of people who did do well at school, college university whatever and even though they thought they were doing the right thing the negative outcome still occurs.


I see a lot of societal drop out tbh. I see it in TEFL. You can find 10000s of examples of people downing tools and simply going off to China to teach illegally. They are paid a pittance in western wages but they arbitrage their white skin and are instantly propelled to an upper class tier position in China.

Anyway, there's no point arguing with you, you'll see soon enough by yourself. My best friend is a Barcelona fan who watched every game for years, he can't believe they're getting so much money for Pedro and can't understand why everyone wants him.

I'll repeat my earlier post about him...

&gt;Alexis is a better player than Pedro in pretty much any imaginable parameter. They're not really comparable or similar other than both being Barcelona players.

&gt;Pedro is a lot more of the utility, tactical type - he's not a flair player as Alexis and won't do his magic. Pedro does his job well, usually it involves pressing, work rate, making off the ball runs and finishing. He's kind of similar to Willian I guess, but with a killer instinct, likes to get in the box a lot more than Willian.

&gt;Cesc and Oscar will probably love his runs and will play through balls to him, which he'll usually finish well. But if he gets the ball outside the box or not in a good goalscoring position, he won't do any of that magic Alexis does.

Fourth, is Liz Kendall - She does seem like a genuine, passionate member of the Labour party. However, she is definitely incredibly inexperienced (she seems more like she's applying for The Apprentice than for leader of the Labour Party). Also, she hasn't stood on a solid platform, and where she has expressed her views, they are views I disagree with.

Third, is Andy Burnham - his CURRENT platform would, in fact, match my views exactly. The problem is that I had to qualify it with ""current"", because Andy seems to change his mind and contradict himself literally every fucking day. He has demonstrated all the traits that made Miliband a bad leader, and how can one possibly expect the electorate to believe Andy's platform if even Andy himself doesn't believe it...

Therefore, begrudgingly, my second preference is Yvette Cooper - her actual platform isn't that bad and it is coherent. The comments she made about Corbyn left a bad taste in my mouth, and I regretted putting her as my second preference after reading the comments she made towards Andy. This kind of vitriol isn't something that should belong in the Labour party. (If I could revote now, Cooper wouldn't even be on the list and Andy would be my second preference)

(The disclaimer I should add is my main reason for putting Corbyn first is less because I am a diehard socialist, but rather because the other candidates have been so dire - I mean, for fucks sake, all the PLP had to do was put forward someone who could stand on Ed Miliband's exact platform but without the incompetence of Ed Miliband..)",null,0,null,1439990239,null,null,1439990462,0,cu87cxh,null,t3_3hi8fk,null,null,null,t3_3hi8fk,null,null,null,1441341925,null,1,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,1,null

Incendiary cigarettes aren't regulated in this manner, despite also being a delivery mechanism for an addictive drug (and as the report points out, a bunch of other very very nasty chemicals that are either added to the tobacco or a product of the burning process).

If you're going to apply strong regulation to them on the grounds they are a drug delivery mechanism with potential harmful side effects, then you damn well should be applying **much** stronger regulation to incendiary cigarettes which are a drug delivery mechanism with **known** harmful side effects.

Riding through a lovely valley on a narrow, B road. The area was flat with long grass on each side obscuring my view of the road around the bends, with no other markers that would tell me how the road was going to bend past beyond my vision point.

Got caught out by what I thought was a shallow right hander that actually was actually a moderate right hander with tightening towards the end and I had over-cooked the throttle.

Briefly target fixated on where I thought I would leave the road, enough to make sure I eventually did. Wrestled harder into the turn, hit the verge, but I hadn't turned enough and ended in a small depression at the side of the, about three feet deep and full of rocks.

Neither of us got thrown off, no injuries and not even any damage to the bike. Pushed and cajoled the bike to a nearby patch of dirt, calmed down, got back on and was less aggressive with the throttle from the the rest of the day.

The DUP are the majority group who are forcing blasphemy laws and anti-gay regulations in N.Ireland. People like him, and his supported DUP politics are the reason why N.Ireland is stuck in the 1950s, and the reason he is in court for breaking laws which the DUP and the UK have enforced in N.Ireland.

null,null,jester92800,num5,,null,"The thing not mentioned here is that we're not as rich as some of these other clubs.  Levy is tasked with keeping his costs down whenever possible, given the huge amount of investment that the club has in off-field projects at the moment (essentially rebuilding northumberland).  At the moment, Levy's task is to ensure that we remain a competitive and exciting prospective football club, a task that he has succeeded at in spades with the leveraging of our training facilities and the hiring of a manager / staff with a proven track record of developing world class talent.  

The next step will be to step up spending as the debt becomes revenue with the new stadium and improved brand presence around the world (a feat that is occurring before my eyes in the USA, as I am regularly finding that people not only know who Spurs are, but can speak with at least some knowledge about the club too, outside of ""you guys had Bale, right?""

Basically, I think that it is shortsighted and unfair to call Levy ""addicted to haggling"" because he is not only running a business, in which you could justify overspending to elevate your brand into the next tier of the marketplace (if that was the case, you just bid a few million more and bring in whoever we've been linked with, no problem), but is also running a complex business with multiple other arms that he is required to balance as well (or at least required to not imbalance by his actions).  Finally, he is running a team at the heart of all this-- if you spend enough, I'm sure you could get just about anyone to come to Spurs, but you also need to make sure they're people who both want to be here, and will be motivated to prove their quality.  That has to be a factor in all of the work that's done-- if the player is not going to be good for the room, good for the squad, good for the brand, etc. you need to evaluate the risk.

TL;DR-- he's not perfect, but I think that with the financials the way they are and the development that the club is working on, Levy is doing an incredible job.",null,0,null,1439992169,null,null,false,0,cu88bbp,null,t3_3hkqnn,null,null,null,t3_3hkqnn,null,null,null,1441342376,null,3,null,coys,t5_2ryq7,3,null

In my experience, the aim was to do everything by the book. Correctly, as we have been instructed. 

I know I felt a lot of sympathy for clients myself. So did most of my colleagues. We would often work late and go out of our way just to get those first payments out for young single parents, disabled people, and others who were clearly in desperate need. We didn't have to, but we did because we actually cared.

The people we served were people from the same communities as us. They were our sisters, brothers, friends, aunts, uncles, neighbours etc. People we gave a shit about. The community we lived in. 


If we didn't care and only saw it as a 'job' then fuck, we could get far more money working in the private sector. Better pensions, benefits and bonuses too. The civil service isn't the gravy train portrayed in the media. Not at the bottom where most people are.

I wanted to do that job because I had experience working in commercial jobs where profit is everything and fuck the customer. I didn't want to spend the rest of my life exploiting people for profit, so I joined the civil service. I may not work for them any more but I still work in a similar public service sector as a teacher. And I love it. People before profit.

Same goes for individual Doctors and showrunners- you might prefer focusing on the story arc, or prefer monster-of-the-week episodes.

I've found that doing a ""best hits"" run is a lot better than trying to do the whole thing. Tried introducing my wife to Doctor Who (she'd seen Matt Smith's second season onwards, but not anything else). Skipping the more juvenile bits was the only way she'd keep watching, rather than sticking with Capaldi.

If you're 5 episodes in, you're about to hit Dalek, which is when the Doctor gets a bit of depth and backstory (re)introduced. Might be worth skipping The Long Game, which doesn't add much, and possibly even Father's Day if you're not that invested in Rose. Empty Child is when it starts to get really good.

- English born and bred
- TS, Mumble, Skype, Cup-and-string, Pigeon etc
- I will be going to i55 this year and don't have a DotA team, so could be a good opportunity to get some structured games in pretty soon if you are interested.

Because you increase the equity so when you remortgage you have a much lower LTV requirement so will get a better mortgage deal. 

(The following is from Santander).

If I buy a £100,000 house with 95% LTV there are only two mortgages available. I would get a 2 yr fixed mortgage at 4.74% for £528 a month. 

If I do the same but put in another £5000 deposit for 90% LTV there are now 5 mortgages I can choose, the 2yr fixed is now 3.65% and payments are £458 a month saving me £840 a year, equivalent to an interest rate on that £5000 of savings I used of 16.8%.

Also interest rates on mortgages are still higher than most regular forms of savings so the money you overpay on a mortgage with a 2.5% interest rate is in effect getting a better return than it would in a savings account with 1.5%.",null,0,null,1439994383,null,null,false,0,cu89jvn,null,t3_3hexqu,null,null,null,t1_cu7izmz,null,null,null,1441342958,null,1,null,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1,null

One of the biggest objections that you could make to this is found during *The Christmas Invasion*.

Diversity doesn't mean much and can't stand up to the idea that characters should be written *well*.

&gt; 

If we'd just stopped all immigration, and also any Brits on holiday coming back in, we wouldn't have any TB here. That may be true - but so what?

&gt;Also it is perfectly acceptable by many people who clearly didn't grow up in the UK spit on the floor, 

TB is not spread by spitting, or kissing, or sharing toothbrushes. It doesn't spread through saliva.

&gt;and cough without covering their mouths. 

You need to spend several hours a day with someone with TB to catch it. This is why the spread is mostly within families. You don't need to worry about the immigrant on the bus.

Also, I don't know if you've been living under a rock but an awful lot of 'home-grown' British people are chronically rude these days.

&gt;Also quite laughable that the MP would start with air quality, communicable diseases and obesity wtf? Does obesity or air quality have to do with a respiratory disease...

Obesity has clear impacts on the immune system.

There is also an association between poor air quality and an increased incidence of pathoogen-caused respiratory diseases.

Maybe do an ounce of research before you start laughing. Moron.

I personally believe that free expression is a fundamental right, and that the onus is on those who wish to suppress it, to prove beyond reasonable doubt that any given example is directly going to cause actual harm (hurt feelings / offence is NOT enough).

Overall, context is key - for example, in your comment, you are clearly speaking hypothetically, and thus almost anything is permissible to be said - meta-discussion of any topic must be legitimate.

If one were to actually say (and mean it - which is key): ""hang that person from a tree!"", then that has crossed the line in my opinion, but even then, context would still be a potential defence, as the threat must be credible and plausible, before any prosecution would be appropriate.

null,null,Riddla26,eng-manchester,Manchester - City Of Science,null,"Harm reduction is still a worthy goal. Look it up.

The best we can do for now is study the immediate and intermediate effects of e-cigarette vapour on cells and brain chemistry and at present there hasn't been a study that wasn't discredited (like the FDA study from 2009 that was withdrawn as it's completely false data, vaporising the liquid at many times the temperature any device actually gets to) that shows damage caused by e-cigarettes.

If smoking takes 20 years off your life and e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful, that's essentially giving smokers back 19 years of their lives. No one not currently smoking tobacco should even consider using e-cigarettes and so you can't really use ""but it takes a year off your life"" as a valid argument, it's not the target demographic. Those people you mention clearly haven't done their research, but when all's said and done I'm glad they're vaping rather than smoking but it's definitely not harmless especially if you've never smoked before.

The reason so much effort has gone into demonising cigarettes is because the popular belief really was that smoking was good for you in the 20's and 30's and now we've discovered otherwise there's a big effort going into reducing smoking everywhere, which IMO is absolutely great. Whether the same things will happen in 20 years with e-cigarettes is yet to be seen but ALL the evidence right now points to no. Even if there are some long term complications, 95% better than smoking is still 95% better than smoking.",null,0,null,1439996211,null,null,false,0,cu8anup,null,t3_3hjcjp,null,null,null,t1_cu82rva,null,null,null,1441343482,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

The only reason for Pedro's seeming decline is losing his consistent playing time to Alexis and Neymar/Suarez. He is truly a rhythm player that relies on playing extended minutes to develop a feel for the game and then pick his spots. He played well in a backup role that his game isn't really suited for. Replacing Willian on the right wing is the ideal spot for him. Pedro makes well timed and intelligently paced runs into the box and can both finish and cross with confidence. He has a great first touch and good vision. He is the ideal player to put next to Costa and Hazard. He is steady and reliable. 

Don't forget that people felt the same way about Alexis when he left for Arsenal. The fact that he was struggling to thrive in Barça and then is a world class superstar at Arsenal tells you all you need to know about the competition at Barça and the quality of its players. 

This bodes well for Willian, who will lose playing time but hopefully move to a forward sitting RAM, which is really his best spot and where he dominated from at Donetsk. Considering Oscar's fitness issues and inconsistency, competition at that spot is vital.

1. Don't give up. Power through. It gets so much better later, I promise.

OR, the less painful route:

2. Convince her to let you skip ahead. My first introduction to Doctor Who was season one (9th doctor, with Rose) and I hated it. To be perfectly honest, I still do. I'm not sure how much of that is my genuine opinion and how much was affected by marathon-watching season one and two episodes in my obsessed friend's bedroom even as I pleaded with her that I hated it, thought it was super cheesy, poor quality, and that I was not (at the time) interested in Sci-fi. 

Flash forward and my husband's film professor gets him hooked, so he begs me to watch. I started with season 5 and absolutely fell in love - with a show  I said a few years earlier was total garbage. 

The thing is, for new fans, if the show isn't taking, season 5 forward can be easier to digest because it has a bigger budget, thus better production value, a new feel, etc. It starts coming across more like mini movies (no more cheesy bad CGI and effects). In my personal opinion, it starts making more sense, too, less plot holes. But at the same time, accepting some ""plot holes"" and things that can't quite be explained or make sense also is part of watching the show. But there are less flat-out absurd things compared to the earlier seasons. 

I have thoroughly loved this show season 5 through the present. I did go back and watch everything from 2005 forward. It helps once you already love the show. 

Season 4 is really brilliant. It's my favorite David Tennant year, personally. But a lot of people find it best to start at 5.",null,0,null,1439996494,null,null,false,0,cu8au6h,null,t3_3hkund,null,null,null,t3_3hkund,null,null,null,1441343564,null,6,null,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,6,null

I didn't expect Mane to be around for too long - maybe as little as two seasons - before he upscaled, but it'd be a Lovren-esque piss-take to add him to the ""one and done"" pile. 

I suppose United are leaking their interest to the media because they know Mane has form for kicking up a stink when a lucrative transfer is in the offing - he threatened to go on strike at Salzburg once Saints came in for him, but we don't talk about that when we're scolding Lallana for doing the same in order to leave us. 

If United want him enough, he's gone. Which would be devastating. 

On the plus side, he's got three years on his contract, so Saints have no reason to bend over and accept any bid below something absolutely ridiculously extortionate. £30+m.

Who ever takes the Doctor seriously before things go really sideways, anyway?

&gt;If the Doctor were able to choose his appearance, he would have been ginger and he wouldn't always be surprised by his new body parts. 

The Doctor CAN'T consciously choose, although he does seem to choose subconsciously. Hell, the elixir on Karn could have been a placebo to get his conscious and unconscious minds in line with one another. In the 10-11 regeneration, he thought he had become a woman for a couple seconds.

&gt;I just don't think that the writers could do a good enough job of explaining all of the little details that would come along with the Doctor becoming a female. 

They did a perfectly fine job explaining away completely changing out actors on the first regeneration. I think a gender change can be done well.


&gt;I think it would be amazing if they could write in a female Time Lord to possibly travel with the Doctor, but I don't think that having the Doctor be a female would be a positive change for the show. 

You are, of course, entitled to your opinion; but I think there had been a similar sentiment with every regeneration, and every change in the dynamic of the show. One of the great things about the Doctor is that there are no limits. Even what he says is impossible happens with surprising regularity. Even what the writers say often becomes possible.

It's good there are a lot of local breweries popping up, but the quality needs to increase. The prices are also insane in places like the Woodworkers, in all their photos no one seems to be drinking beer and I can't blame them when the cheapest craft beer is near £5, it's not a Brewdog bar for fucks sake. It would be nice if there where more places with something other than Greene King as their sole cask beer as well.


There also seems to be a trend of bringing out ""Irish pale ales"" which are just underhopped and bland as fuck.

Finally, education &amp; rehabilitation. Explain that criminals generally only stop when they are caught and by then it's too late to avoid a record and far more severe punishment than they now face. Explain that it's not free stuff and everyone *except* the shop suffers, as they pass on their costs.

It is important to note it was on the basis of these issues Labour continued to lose votes to the Tories in this election. So I don't share the analysis that you can win an election on an anti-establishment platform since for every 2 votes you gain from other parties you would probably lose 1 to the Tories - thereby not putting a dent in the gap between them.


https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/01/29/three-trumps-could-win-labour-election/

To me the main problem is the lack of clarity and narrative of the centre-left at the moment. There is little vision, and little imagination. In part because new ideas are too easily dismissed as ""Tory-lite""; and in part because of a fear of being seen as too radical.

It is also because modern life delivers for many people and it would dishonest to say otherwise. Despite what the Daily Mail might say about multiculturalism and the Morning Star might say about capitalism - many people are satisfied with their lot.

Labour's argument will always be - things are good for some, but they can be so much better for so many others. However, the difficulty will be convincing those who are satisfied with what they have to vote to change things for those who are not. One of the saddest things about the election is Labour had clear policies about ending unfairness through the bedroom tax and zero hour contracts, but these important issues don't seem to be enough of a reason to vote Labour. It feels like the story Labour has to tell now is about a vision for society that will improve everyone's life, not just those with the least.

TL;DR
What is the vision Labour can have for 2020 that everyone can identify with? Because I've yet to hear a really convincing argument from anyone.

null,null,MichealSheLooked16,eng-yorkshire,Sheffield,null,"The problem is politicians say they'll reduce it but don't, for instance net migration not dropping during the coalition even after cameron said he'd drop it down to tens of thousands. There was 290,000 immigrants (190,000 net) from outside the EU in 2014 so they can't blame this issue on the EU.

I find this worrying because either,

a) we have no real control over our border even from outside the EU

or

b) the government has no intention to deal with immigration from outside the EU

I think it may show the general attitude of our EU and national leaders attitudes towards immigration. The British people have never wanted the level of immigration we have now. I'm not surprised most agree the rate of immigration is too high, looking at my home city the non-native population increased from 10% to 20% in 10 years (this is relatively consistent with the country), this rate is too high and is changing the demographics of the UK permanently, and I wonder what the 2021 census will say.

I find it particularly hilarious when they're surprised parties such as Golden Dawn or the Swedish Democrats get support. They don't listen to the population on immigration so push them into voting for parties with neo-nazi links because they're the only ones who care. We're lucky we have a moderate anti-immigration party (or anti-mass immigration w/e) instead of the only option being the BNP.

I don't buy the argument that we need them to pay the boomers pension, i'd happily accept slightly higher taxes and an accumulation of debt to get through their retirement while we incentivise increasing the populations birth rates to replacement. But it seems that boat has sailed and we're happy with one day becoming a minority in many British cities. Also instead of getting immigrants to do the jobs we're short in could we not just allocate our skills better? (like for instance not treating doctors like shit so they don't all leave).

You can't just hand 11 year olds the power to say ""so and so did X, punish him!"". Therefore you can't punish what you can't see. 

I was a victim of bullying. The school were aware. They were on the lookout. It happened on the bus, or the way home, or when the teacher was out of the room. 

What I needed wasn't a more effective teacher or school, what I needed was the mental tools to cope with it and not be a target in the longer term. I needed confidence not an appeal to authority. 

There's a lot schools can do to improve confidence that they don't, and thanks to government targets we can't kick out nearly as many kids as we'd like and without that option really there's only so much behaviour you can manage. Especially if you're a school in a poor area who ends up with the kids kicked out from elsewhere. 

A wider curriculum that allowed people to find their niche would help IMO. As would actual training for all (parents, teachers, students) in basic mindfulness and self management techniques. And a removal of the system that punishes schools for sticking to their behaviour policy if they need to, ideally backed up with some kind of system of last resort for kids with serious issues that bounce from school to school.

There may be someone out there who is quality for league cup, europa, etc. that we can grab on the cheap (and I'm sure we're looking).

The worst crimes are the knife &amp; knuckle dusters. Don’t be surprised to find yourself charged with possession of an offensive weapon &amp; I doubt the court will believe your protestations about the knife when you’re carrying knuckle dusters as well. The 3"" thing is irrelevant if the courts believe you intended to use the knife in any kind of violent fashion (which includes self-defense) &amp; you had a locking blade anyway, so the length limit doesn’t matter.

WTF do you think you’re doing carrying knuckle dusters &amp; a knife when going out on the lash? One punch or stab &amp; you could easily kill somebody &amp; then it’s hello life imprisonment &amp; someone else’s life on your conscience. Jeepers.

Your priorities are:

1) Get a lawyer.
2) Do what they say.
3) Cross your fingers, because you’re looking at a mandatory minimum sentence of 6 months inside if the CPS decides to prosecute and it’s an open&amp;shut case to which you have no defence in court.

See the sentencing guidelines here: http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/l_to_o/offensive_weapons_knives_bladed_and_pointed_articles + here http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/sentencing_manual/knives_and_offensive_weapons/ If you’re lucky, they might just give you a community order of some sort for a Level 1 possession offence, but I wouldn’t count on that.

Suck it up, and for the love of God try not to be so dumb when you get out of prison after two or three months for good behaviour (you *are* going to keep your head down, yes?)

Obviously any CRB check is going to pick up on this conviction until it’s spent &amp; enhanced ones even afterwards.

BTW, did I mention that you need a lawyer? Because you need a lawyer: in the worst case (for everyone involved) if things go south for the victim &amp; in a week’s time they die from head injuries sustained during the fight, the CPS could decide to prosecute you on a murder charge under the joint enterprise doctrine, regardless of whether you were directly involved in the fight or not.",null,0,null,1439998689,null,null,1440001957,0,cu8c8t7,null,t3_3hl158,null,null,null,t3_3hl158,null,null,null,1441344293,null,14,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14,null

null,null,bulldada,null,null,null,"It's a fair point to make, most people who don't use e-cigarettes still consider vapers to be 'smokers'.

There is nothing addictive or habit forming about tobacco cigarettes in themselves, which is just a delivery mechanism. The two factors to overcome when quitting smoking is the physical addictivity of nicotine, and the habit forming aspects of the daily routine of smoking. By replacing traditional cigarettes with e-cigarettes, you don't stop either of those things, the delivery mechanism for the nicotine changes, but the physical addiction remains and is sustained, as does the psychological habit formed part. They haven't quit anything.

I don't think anyone would claim to have quit heroin because they switched from smoking it to injecting it (or vaping it, hypothetically). Part of the problem is that by far the most common way of consuming nicotine is smoking tobacco, thus the name 'smoker' became commonplace for 'nicotine consumer', very few other substances have their delivery mechanisms as the name for describing their users (stoner, junkie, crackhead, X-addict, etc).

For what it's worth, I don't consider people who have switched to nicotine gum/lozenges/patches/etc to have 'quit' either.

It's not about the police. No-one is blaming the police. Introducing armed police to a situation carries a non-zero risk that someone will be shot by them, regardless of how well trained they are. Situations can be misconstrued. SWAT officers are not mind-readers, or blessed with a full briefing from pre-cognitive psychics like in Minority Report.

And frankly, if armed police entered my house my first thought wouldn't be ""gosh, I feel relatively safe because these guys are so well trained"". It would be ""oh shit, there is a guy in a balaclava pointing a sub-machine gun at my centre of body mass"". Even if they just turned up, politely knocked on the door, and explained themselves, I think that might negatively impact my general mental wellbeing for quite a while, knowing that someone felt that kind of ill will towards me.

So, to summarize

* A tiny risk of being shot is much worse than zero risk of being shot
* Some degree of lasting harm is inevitable regardless of whether you do get shot
* And neither of these things are the fault of the officers dispatched to the scene

I associated the tactic of swatting with GamerGate, because that's how I first heard of swatting, and because it seems a similar situation - the use of swatting as harassment against a woman with a high profile on the internet who I'm presuming has some kind of feminist agenda.

It's really rather interesting how many people have taken an issue with that association, but it would clearly be presumptuous of me to draw any kind of meaning from that.

The other comments on this topic like ""more likely she just got a knock on the door"", *hilarious* jokey comments about how awful a person she is, and the voting down of speculation that it might **gasp** have been a man that did this seem to show a general leaning in a particular direction, but it's my comment about a fairly obvious association with the tactics of a verified misogynist movement that seems to have attracted three or four accusations of bias.

In Kent there are plenty of fruit picking jobs to be had,  the wages paid are the same whether you are British or an immigrant. I did that work when I was younger and I worked with plenty of British people that did it full time during the season and they did season after season. 10 -  20 years later and the wages have increased and it pays more than JSA but the vast majority are now EU immigrants and there are no new English workers, still some of the old hands doing it but they can't do it forever.  The farmers have no problem taking English workers but many of them don't make a second week, or even a second day, he has even told me that he expects to lose a few on Monday lunchtime. It pays more than JSA but it is hard work and the British tend to want the easier life. Not all brits, he makes a distinction between British students and the work shy benefits scroungers. Students will work a full summer no problem but those who get benefits invariably fall back on them and stop turning up. 

So some employers may use it to bring down wages but not all. There are many benefits claimants who are happy claiming and don't see a need to work. I left a town filled with those people a d worked my way out of it, I agree the safety net is needed,  it provided for me and my family in one way or another growing up, but there are generations of families that are stuck in the trap of not working and the next generation repeats the mistakes of their parents because that is the example that has been set to them.

The contract should also require your partner to account to you promptly at regular intervals in relation to the money received and the steps to be taken when you turn 18. Contracts with minors (i.e. anyone under the age of 18) are mired with complexities.

Alternatively, and assuming you're at least 16 years of age, you could consider incorporating a company with your partner with both of you being directors and the contract with the gateways being in the name of the company. At the same time, you could enter into a shareholders' agreement which provides that your partner will transfer their shares to you when you reach 18 and that any director who ceases to hold shares must resign from the board of directors. This will give you complete control as the sole director and shareholder.

A deed of trust provides that the assets are being held on trust by your partner for your benefit when you reach 18. However, if there are any assets which form trust property and you're maintaining control over them then your trust is likely to be viewed as a sham and void as a result. In any event, trusts have their own issues, such as what happens if you die before reaching 18, or what happens if the payment gateways accounts can't be transferred into your name for some unforeseen reason when you turn 18?

null,null,Riddla26,eng-manchester,Manchester - City Of Science,null,"&gt; There is nothing addictive or habit forming about tobacco cigarettes in themselves, which is just a delivery mechanism.

This is bullshit straight from the off. Tobacco is treated and coated with [more than 500 different chemicals](http://www.tricountycessation.org/tobaccofacts/Cigarette-Ingredients.html), preservatives and additives, many of which are present with the EXPRESS purpose of making them more addictive. The combustion of which creates more than [4,000 harmful byproducts.](http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/215420.php)

&gt;The two factors to overcome when quitting smoking is the physical addictivity of nicotine, and the habit forming aspects of the daily routine of smoking. By replacing traditional cigarettes with e-cigarettes, you don't stop either of those things, the delivery mechanism for the nicotine changes, but the physical addiction remains and is sustained, as does the psychological habit formed part. They haven't quit anything.

[The physical addictivity of nicotine on it's own is about the same as caffeine](http://discovermagazine.com/2014/march/13-nicotine-fix). See the paragraph titled ""Not the Great Satan"", however the entire article is well worth a read as nicotine, when disassociated from tobacco, has many and varied therapeutic effects and has proven effective in the relief of many horrible illnesses symptoms. The psychological addiction is most definitely real, but orders of magnitude less difficult to break when the 500 odd additives are removed from your brain chemistry.

Relevant paragraphs:

&gt;Perhaps most surprising is that, in studies by Boyd and others, nicotine has not caused addiction or withdrawal when used to treat disease. These findings fly in the face of nicotine’s reputation as one of the most addictive substances known, but it’s a reputation built on myth. Tobacco may well be as addictive as heroin, as some have claimed. But as scientists know, getting mice or other animals hooked on nicotine alone is dauntingly difficult. As a 2007 paper in the journal Neuropharmacology put it: “Tobacco use has one of the highest rates of addiction of any abused drug.” Paradoxically it’s almost impossible to get laboratory animals hooked on pure nicotine, though it has a mildly pleasant effect. 

And also:

&gt;In short, the estimated 45.3 million people, or 19.3 percent of all adults, in the United States who still smoke are not nicotine fiends. They’re nicotine-anabasine-nornicotine-anatabine-cotinine-myosmine-acetaldehyde-and-who-knows-what-else fiends. It is tobacco, with its thousands of chemical constituents, that rightly merits our fear and loathing as the Great Satan of addictiveness. Nicotine, alone: not so much.

So yes, in fact, they have quit a GREAT many horrendous added drugs that aren't present in e-cigarettes and are left with a substance which on it's own provides a mildly pleasant effect with very few long term health concerns.

Your middle paragraph is complete twaddle and again based purely on what you ""feel"" and semantics so I'm ignoring it as irrelevant.

&gt;For what it's worth, I don't consider people who have switched to nicotine gum/lozenges/patches/etc to have 'quit' either. From experience, friends that use NRT (including e-cigs) will all go back to smoking regular cigarettes as soon as they run out of patches/juice/battery/etc and can't obtain any more.

That's because they clearly don't WANT to quit. I haven't smoked a cigarette in 3 years, I'm looking at putting the e-cigarette down too, but even now cigarettes and especially tobacco smoke ABSOLUTELY DISGUST me. I cannot stand the smell, I cannot fathom what possessed me to smoke in the first place all those years ago. I would absolutely NEVER touch another cigarette for the rest of my life and I guess that your friends really just never wanted to give up in the first place. If they ""can't"" obtain any more they really mustn't have been trying very hard

Now what you have here is a bunch of sources, well written and researched articles containing information that directly flies in the face of your assumptions.
