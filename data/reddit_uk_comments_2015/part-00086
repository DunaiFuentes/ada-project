The debt to GDP ratio went up by 6% from 2001-7. This is not a hugely dramatic amount; as you can see, it was very stable relative to the 1990s and 2007 onwards (periods that saw increases of 20% and 40% respectively).

If you are going to blame Brown for the economic crisis, and currently high levels of government debt, I don't think it's very plausible to do so on the basis that he was 'borrowing at the height of the boom' or spent too much - because even if he had CUT the debt-to-GDP ratio by 6% instead of raising it, the only difference now would be a debt-to-GDP ratio of ~80% instead of ~90%, which still leaves us in a similiar position.


Sure, maybe Brown was slightly fiscally irresponsible - maybe he should have been aiming to cut the debt-to-GDP ratio to 30% or whatever - but it doesn't bear much on our current situation. The tripling of debt-to-GDP since 2001 is almost entirely to do with developments post-2007.

And to be honest, it's not at all clear that current government debt (despite having tripled to 90% of GDP) is much of a problem *in the short run*. Real interest rates are incredibly low, so it's incredibly cheap to service. In the long run, there may be a problem - but we don't know what's going to happen really (e.g. whether we're facing secular stagnation, another Japanese 'lost decade', or what) - but hopefully it can be gradually paid off when/if stable growth returns.

Either way, I don't think you can blame it - currently high debt levels - on Brown's fiscal irresponsibility.",null,0,null,1425614243,null,0,1425614822,0,cp5xkl8,null,t3_2y0psb,null,t1_cp5xkl8,null,t1_cp5nku9,null,null,null,1427605978,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

**Call of employment**RE: Alistair. I carry out a lot of interviews at work, and always make it a point to discuss outside interests with candidates. It can be the best part of the interview when it comes to differentiating between people, and gives me a good idea of what they will be like to work with.

I can think of two examples of people writing gaming down as one of their hobbies, both rather different.The first person told me they liked all kinds of games, but were very reticent when it came to explaining anything about their interest to me. I felt I would have to really push for a decent answer, which I’m not going to do. If that is the most passionate someone can get about what they do for fun, I’m not really interested.

The other person I interviewed told me that they enjoyed Call Of Duty, FIFA and Minesweeper (very boring games to talk about, I thought). The reasons they gave for liking these games and the challenges they presented were both thought-provoking and hilarious - how many people would claim that Minesweeper should be mandatory in the workplace in their first interview?! (Apparently a little puzzle every now and then greatly improves problem-solving skills).The second interviewee has just lent me my first first person shooter, Call Of Duty: Black Ops, and is a valued and highly respected member of the team, despite only placing third in the Minesweeper leaderboard.

I think the key thing to bear in mind is that the worst you can do is put something you’re not really interested in, or can’t articulate, on your CV – far too many people put down ‘walking’ and then can’t remember their last walk, and don’t have a favourite, and don’t own walking boots (see also music, sport, and reading). The worst thing an interviewer can do is not bother to ask you about these things; they could be missing out on a real gem. Good luck in finding a job.

He still is very hesitant to come out for long balls that he should be easily. A recent example would be that one chance where Aguero hit the post which caused Skrtel to have a right go at him for backpeddling to the net instead of actually just coming to collect the ball. He's done that on numerous occasions in big games. I think we are so much better defensively now than we were before which has given Mignolet more confidence. In reality we have an average of 1-2 shots conceded on target per game so you could argue our defensive record is down to our vastly improved defense and not Mignolet being as good as people on here suddenly rate him. He's had to make the least amount of saves from any other starting keeper this season (From Squawka). The difference between now and when he was going through his bad period was that he can actually kick the ball without it going out of play every other time, and that he can actually catch/punch crosses. According to Squawka stats he also has the 2nd lowest claim/punch success of any other GK for the season.  I still think a GK is one of our priorities, and with Cech / Handanovic seemingly available this summer either of them would be dream signings. 

**TLDR. I feel like people got so used to exceptionally poor Mignolet that now that he's performing like a proper GK they think he's one of the best GKs in the league. In reality he still has a lot of weaknesses and could be majorly improved upon this summer.**

This isn't as bad as you think it is right now.

I checked the statistics, and for the 2013-14 period, the average pass rate for driving tests on the first attempt was 51.3. This means that almost half of the people who take their first test fail, so it is not unusual by any stretch of the imagination. Just get straight back on the horse - book another test immediately and take the experience and lessons learned from this one into your second try.

The more pressing matter is your job. I would strongly recommend being honest with your fiancee and your friends - they are your support network, but they can't support you if you're not honest with them. I'm sure they will be really understanding and supportive if you open up to them.

I used to be the one who never shared my problems, and was always positive, and there when my friends needed me. After a good few years of struggling alone though I realised that they wanted to do the same for me. Give them a chance.

As for the job situation, well you tried it and you don't like it - see this as another lesson learned. Carry on for the moment, but get your cv sorted out, and start applying for new stuff. 

If you are a new graduate then you are only young, which means you have plenty of time to figure out what you want to do. Think about what parts of your current role you enjoy, and also what kind of stuff you enjoy outside work, and then try see what other roles these skills translate to. Feel free to send me your cv if you'd like someone to take a look at it before you start applying for other jobs. 

Last comment - don't be so hard on yourself. Life in general can be tough - you don't need to make this worse by being tough on yourself as well! Give yourself a break, no one gets things right all the time - life is a collection of lessons and experiences, constantly learning and developing. Try to take the lessons out of this situation, and use it to improve things going forward

**Where did you purchase**: Chemimart Pharmacy (Malta)

**About you**: Combo-oily, sensitive (among others, my skin takes the habit of breaking out in hives when it doesn't like something I eat or put on my skin), SD/PD-prone. OSPW. Fitzpatrick IV.

**Your opinion**: I heard many in US saying that this leaves film and causes breakouts.  I experienced neither. This is the first product I introduced after I scraped my whole routine clean and started over after my my new year SD flareup subsided. I used nothing else (no treatments, serums and/or moisturizer) but this. It leaves my skin feeling cleaned and comfortable. No tightness, no dryness. I could even go out makeup free because my skin looks good, given I was abstain from any other treatment regimen.

It doesn't seem to breakdown any makeup, but I don't expect it to. I take off my makeup with micellar water beforehand (I want to go back to my pre-wash oil-cleansing routine after I test out some oils). But with bare face, I think it's pretty great.

If you can, beg borrow and steal to get above that 90% LTV threshold. I'm guessing you're taking out a ""help to buy"" mortgage, which more realistically should have been called ""help to prop up house builders"". 

You earn a quite substantial amount, and you're a dual income couple. There's no reason you shouldnt get a good mortgage for the home you want. Wait a year, economise on some things, save some more money. It isn't mental to think you can live off of your salary alone, and put all of hers into the deposit fund.

If you can get a 3% cheaper mortgage by not going down the help to buy route, it will save you nearly 5k in your first year on a 160k mortgage.

The geology of the ground definitely makes a difference and in some cases the rats just aren't suitable for the task and it falls back on manual deminers. The rats are super quick but the environment has to be correct. The [recent flooding in Bosnia](http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/19/world/europe/balkans-flooding/), for example, has meant that the mines have shifted all over the place and that will be a tricky job for anyone to clean up. 

The rats are cheap to maintain and deploy but strictly that cheap to train and consequently they are in no way replaceable. The economics of the rat detection system require us not to be losing rats as they take about nine months and £7,000 to train. 

The article was okay and the Guardian have featured us quite a few times so perhaps they didn't feel the need to go too in depth this time. We've recently had documentaries on German and Russian state TV but we've not had anything full length in England quite yet. We'd love to but we're only a small team on the communication side whereas the press we generate (Because of the rats0 is comparable to a much larger organisation. 

I've linked a few videos below that will tell you a bit more about how it all works. I'm here all day if any other questions crop up. Thanks for your interest.

null,false,TheSquareMileVampire,null,null,null,"**Cameron and Miliband should go head-to-head FT editorial**

David Cameron’s declaration that he will not hold a head-to-head television debate with Ed Miliband during the general election campaign is timid and cowardly. The prime minister’s tactical reasons for taking this position are easy to understand, of course. The Tories have the upper hand over Labour on the economy and the leader of the opposition has poor personal ratings in opinion polls. To Mr Cameron and his team, a one-to-one debate therefore looks like an unnecessary gamble: public expectations regarding Mr Miliband are so low that the Labour leader only has to put in a half decent performance to receive a poll boost.


However, voters are entitled to take a more principled view on the matter. At the 2010 election, Britain for the first time held three live encounters between the three main party leaders. This created the impression that a Rubicon had been crossed and that they would be a ritual in all future elections. “I think these debates are here to stay,” Mr Cameron said at the time. “They clearly engage people in politics, which is what we need.” His decision to rule out a one-to-one encounter should therefore diminish the prime minister in the eyes of voters. The excuse that he will participate in a single debate encompassing Mr Miliband and five other party leaders will not do. Voters are being cheated of the head-to-head joust that they expect.


The rules and protocols regarding election debates in the UK are confused. Britain does not have an independent body to manage these events akin to the US Commission on Presidential Debates. Negotiations between the political parties and broadcasters over how many to hold and under what format have dragged out, allowing the Conservatives to throw a spanner in the works at moments of their choosing.


However, the Tories’ tactics have played foul with the public interest in two ways. First, there is a clear demand for these debates. The three encounters in 2010 won a total audience of more than 22m — far higher than for regular political TV programmes. About half of voters aged between 18 and 39 said the debates helped them decide how to vote. In a 2013 poll, seven out of 10 Britons said they wanted the debates to happen again.


Second, if the debates are to work there needs to be at least two with different formats. Given the growing support for small parties, it is right that there should be a seven-way encounter involving Ukip, the Greens and others. But Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband are the only two leaders who are vying to head the government after the election. While Britain does not have a presidential system, the ritual of prime minister’s questions in the Commons recognises the leading roles of the head of government and leader of the opposition. The public is entitled to witness at least one encounter between them in five years that goes beyond the weekly Punch and Judy ritual at PMQs.


In ruling out a debate with Mr Miliband, Mr Cameron and his allies are making a crude political calculation. They will get a few days of bad headlines; but that is not as big a risk as taking on the Labour leader in a debate. Their assumption is that voters will greet Mr Cameron’s decision with a cynical shrug — but this will quickly merge with the general contempt that voters have towards all politicians.


The Conservatives may be making a misjudgment, however. Voters could well take the view that the Tories want to go into this election demolishing Mr Miliband’s personality without the prime minister condescending to debate the substance of policy with his rival. There is cowardice here and the voters will smell it.

I don't think it was a help to buy mortgage product, I checked the rate and it is 6.09% for 2 years fixed then 5.73% thereafter.

Obviously I would remortgage after the fixed term to something less insane.

The house we are looking at is £125k which is pretty average for the area (North West) and even at their quoted rate we can comfortably afford the repayment.

We will (hopefully) find the outcome of the DIP today.

Normally I would agree wait a year but we are conscious that the property we rent now (from family) has to be sold this year and we don't want to move, sign another lease for somewhere we would be wanting to stay less than 6-12 months.

There are lenders who would give us 4.64% but according to the IFA we don't meet the criteria with her defaults, although I checked this against their criteria documents myself and we do.

There were some additional issues with the IFA we found, notably rounding down our outgoings, salary and not considering other items clearly shown on our credit reports (phone contracts, broadband/tv packages etc) which doesn't give me faith in the DIP even if it were to be given.

null,false,KarmaUK,null,null,null,"Thanks, and again, sorry if it sounded agressive, it's that so much of what you see seems to be lazy and harmful ways to make life harder for poor people, coming from either the media or the politicians, when they have no concept of what it's like.  

I understand fully how low paid workers are rightfully angry that people on welfare get nearly as much as them, but I question why their anger isn't directed at those who've decided they labour isn't worth more than a subsistence level of pay, because at least in the UK, welfare isn't some great amount.

In short I wish people wouldn't do as the politicians hope, continue fighting among themselves, and start looking up at where the problems start.  For instance ""How do you keep these two thoughts in your head, MPs, that 67 grand isn't enough to live on, and 8 grand in welfare is a luxury lifestyle that needs to be cut?""",null,0,null,1425634752,null,0,false,0,cp64epw,null,t3_2y0bb8,null,t1_cp64epw,null,t1_cp62em0,null,null,null,1427609247,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null
null,false,Seismica,cnty-uk,Teesside,null,"I see a few problems here. Firstly you only advertised in local papers and expected 200 applicants in a matter of weeks (how huge was this project? it sounds like it was poorly managed if recruitment was an afterthought). How else was the role advertised? How did you go from 'There is nobody in this town available for this work' to 'lets get people over from Poland'? If you were willing to provide relocation costs and expanded your candidate search (both time and location), I can guarantee you would have had thousands of UK applicants.

Another issue is the requirements of the role; what did you specify? Setting the bar too high to attract the most skilled applicants can often have a detrimental effect on the number of applicants. Jobseekers will focus their efforts on the roles which they are most likely to get. Also the wage you mentioned below may be above minimum, but sounds low for a decent labourer, especially if it's only temporary/seasonal, which these roles often are. If you only got 1 applicant it's your own fault.

Written on phone, sorry if there are typos.

EDIT: The man has deleted his comment due to the number of downvotes. Come on guys, this is not how we promote discussion. Here is what he said:

&gt; Anecdotal but I'm going to say this. We did a huge infrastructure project in Norfolk recently that needed around 205 people working manual labour type stuff. We advertised in local papers for weeks before hand for positions on the site.

&gt; Do you know how many English people we ended up with working on the site? 1. We had to fly in 204 Poles to get the job done.

It depends on trust though, and if your relationship would be fine with this.

The reason I say use a school textbook for learning it is because it's written in a way to be more engaging and simple for students. It may sacrifice some precision or accuracy but you don't need to know everything there is to know, just the broad basics. 

If you are particularly interested in more broad political theories, you can read up on historical proponents and influential thinkers like Marx, Nietzsche, Bentham, etc. and reading their ideas will give you more perspective and different views on pretty much everything. Again, you can find introductory texts about this stuff in public libraries and school libraries. The text before the contents on wikipedia entries can also be good for a simple overview of political ideas or theories. A lot of political ideas and philosophies are not popular in the UK so if you are primarily concerned about voting and UK politics, you can skip over ideas like Libertarianism, Fascism, etc. since there is 0 chance we will move towards those in any significant way in the near future.

Sounds reasonable:

&gt; The law still prohibits people under 18 from owning or buying a shotgun, or using one without supervision.

Good.

So kids can fire shotguns in a supervised way, only when they've had the chief constable approve? That sounds almost painfully sensible, maybe we should apply some ridiculous blanket rule and make sure they don't grow up understanding how to use them, then give them full unrestricted access when they hit 18.

&gt; Police recorded 7,709 offences involving firearms in 2013/14, down from 8,135 the year before.

Just think of where Britain was in 1915, when we had a population of around 33.5 million.

Ivanovic was of far greater importance in giving us the width and the ability to switch the play than anyone else could offer.

I'd probably also suggest that whilst Matic screens the midfield and forces them wide very often, he often joins the CB pairing very early and we still struggle from late arrivals when the other side have possession.

Not really, he only drove the car, whilst it takes balls to do that, but he always had utmost respect for the fellows that would actually do the disarming and certainly wouldn't want to take their credit.  He never had to do disarming himself, I think he failed the training, he isn't gifted when it came to electrics and schematics and such.  Sadly this was regarding the troubles in northern Ireland, so the level of technical knowledge required was high.

&gt;  The economics of the rat detection system require us not to be losing rats as they take about nine months and £7,000 to train.

Forgive my ignorance, but I'd have thought £7k was a bargain, compared to training a soldier?  Granted it's better to not loose them needlessly, but I figured they didn't live that long, I remember a friend who kept rats as pets said 3 years was a good innings.

The thing that impresses me about this approach is that landmines / cluster munitions, they have one huge benefit for those who deploy them, they are really cheap, they are also often very effective.  Area denial is sadly an important military strategy.  The true cost the 'externalities' is seldom born by those who deployed these weapons, often in parts of the world we don't care much about, as such focusing on safe, cost effective ways of clearing them is vital.

Second, you have to bear in mind a players wishes. It's more than just a short-term player-specific issue. If, as a club, you get a reputation for holding onto potentially useful players even when they're unhappy and want a move, then it impacts ability to sign top talent - especially when they might not be walking straight into the starting 11. Players need to know that a club won't try to stand in their way if things don't work out and they want to move on.

As for specific players leaving - a lot depends on the style of play. What works well for one team setup or style of play doesn't necessarily work for another (Mata being a good example). I think it was clear that Salah wasn't working out in the Chelsea system. Yes, I would have preferred that Fiorentina get a straight loan deal without a buy option. But that's the cost of chasing a team's top player in the January transfer window. They hold your feet to the fire for more favourable terms.

As for KDB... Well, I think if it wasn't a world cup year he would have stayed until the end of the season. Perhaps we didn't give him as much chance as we could, but Oscar was playing so well in the first half of last season it was near impossible to drop him. And once he wants to leave... well there's little point in keeping an unhappy player at the club. Unhappy players don't tend to play to their best, but they do tend to cause problems in the dressing room.


At the end of the day, you can only start 11 players. Some players are willing to take a back seat role and fight for their place, or take a squad position with a particular function (e.g. Mikel). But others just want to play first team football. It's all well and good to look at players who thrive after leaving and wish they were still here, but it's not as simple as that. If we had kept KDB and played him (say) one game in three, would he be as good for us as with Wolfsberg? Unlikely. If instead we'd played him (say) two games in three, would Oscar be happy? Probably not...

As for the City question, well they ""managed to keep"" Dzeko (who still gets plenty of minutes by the way), but were unable to hold on to Negredo. You'll find situations like this in most top clubs.

And if a population of 64 million requires 70% of the country to feed, how much extra land will be required to feed a population of 82 million? As things currently stand, it works out at 10% farmland for every 1% of urbanisation. 

&gt;We can always import extra food. It makes economic sense to do so:

Actually we cannot, or at least should not. [The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/nov/28/un-farmers-produce-food-population)	 has reported that the world needs to be producing 70% more food by 2050 to avoid widespread famine. Reducing our own ability to feed our population will cause us huge problems in the future, as well as being morally wrong, as it will put greater pressure on the developing country's we buy our food from.

I think we should stick with Pellers, at least until his contract is up next season. This season has not been great, everyone knows that. We haven't moved forward and if anything we've regressed somewhat from this point past year. There are huge problems in the squad, that much is obvious, but give the guy a chance to sort it out before we all grab our pitchforks. Look at what Pellers achieved at Villarreal and Malaga when given the time. He took Malaga, a mid table team, to minutes of the CL semi-final! With the resources that City have there's no reason he couldn't take us further eventually. Besides, there isn't a better manager available this summer to come in and replace him, no way would Ancelotti leave Madrid, Pep's contract at Bayern expires 2016 and I don't think Simeone is the right guy for us. He's better as the underdog manager leading a ragtag band to better heights.

As for sales, agree that any of those players could go this summer. Although I think Demi should stay on, the guys 35 this year, there would be little to no sell on value and he still performs well. As for players coming back, Nastasic has already effectively agreed a permanent move to Schalke and Richards and Guidetti are available on frees.

They're much cheaper than training and paying for a deminer, yes. My only point was that they're not disposable assets that we can afford to lose. Plus we love the little creatures. 

&gt; I figured they didn't live that long

Norwegian rats, which are quite a bit smaller, are the most commonly kept domestic rats and they often only live for a few years. We use Gambian Pouched Rats that live with us for about seven years which provides a solid five years of detection activity. 

&gt; they are really cheap

That's one of the major problems and why these indiscriminate weapons continue to exist. Landmines can be bought for about £3 each whereas the clean up cost is between £300 and £1000 depending on conditions, type and density. 

You're completely right that the visual element is crucial when demonstrating how the rats work and how they are treated.

At the end of the meal though the place started to get busy and it took us a long time to get the bill and then when we did the card machine stopped working. It was getting a bit close to the time my ticket ran out but the car was literally less than a hundred yards from the restaurant. But the machine wasn't working and I started to get a little antsy. 

Eventually they got it fixed and I was able to pay with one minute to spare. I stepped outside and there was a parking warden writing out a ticket for my car. I asked if I could help him and he didn't respond. I asked what he was doing and he said he was writing out a ticket for my car. I glanced at the machine and the machine had literally the same time as my ticket on it (13:29 - I remember this even today). I said I hadn't overstayed and he said that I had and slapped a ticket on my windscreen. I took the ticket out and rang the number. Someone answered and I gave them the code but they replied that this code wasn't in their system. I explained that the fine was issued at 13:30 and they said ""But it isn't 13:30 yet"" and it wasn't. I complained but the ticket wasn't withdrawn. 

I discovered after the fact that if I'd have just got in and driven off before he'd slapped the ticket on my windscreen that I'd probably have got away with it. But because I checked the time on the machine and pointed out that the ticket was unwarranted this used up valuable seconds that I could have used to drive off. Moral of the story is don't waste your time attempting to reason with these petty hitlers, just drive off ASAP if they haven't taken a photograph of the ticket on your car (as that is how they ""prove"" they issued it).",null,0,null,1425638398,null,0,false,0,cp654dx,null,t3_2y3oeq,null,t1_cp654dx,null,t3_2y3oeq,null,null,null,1427609575,null,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2,null

And as I have said, what the market will look like in the future is questionable. 

&gt;People have been predicting that population will outgrow food supply since 1798

Is a fallacy to think that just because some people have been saying the same thing for years, what this report says is also wrong.

&gt;GM crops will increase yields massively, especially when we can engineer seeds to be able to grow on land currency considered unsuitable for farming.

Where is the evidence for this? 

&gt;And you also have developing technologies like growing meat industrially rather than getting it from slaughtered animals, and the prospect of vertical farming.

Both will not be for many years. 


&gt;that one would be distant future, but we're talking in a century timescale here

2050 is only 35 years away, not a century. 

It is dangerous to just assume that technology will save us like it always has in the past. We actually need to make sure the technology will be available when we need it, which looks unlikely so far. 

Some other problems are that all the solutions you suggest will increase the cost of food dramatically. There is also the issue of overfishing, and over farming, leading to loss of fertile soil and desertification of farmland. 

Perhaps a magic bullet will appear which solves all our problems in the next 35 years, but it is foolish to make decisions now based on technology that does not yet exist.

&gt;In itself, atheism is an entirely negative position. In pagan Rome, “atheist” (from the Greek atheos) meant anyone who refused to worship the established pantheon of deities.

I disagree because I think its just believing in something different but whatever.

&gt;The term was applied to Christians, who not only refused to worship the gods of the pantheon but demanded exclusive worship of their own god

So how is that a negative position? Also note that this is an almost direct quote from the [Wikipedia article on atheism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism#cite_note-drachmann-11), but changed so it doesn't even mean the same thing anymore

&gt;The term ""atheism"" originated from the Greek ἄθεος (atheos), meaning ""without god(s)"", used as a pejorative term applied to those thought to reject the gods worshiped by the larger society.

Notice that all the author did was add something about Christians. most of the words are in the same order.

Then he goes off on some bollocks rant about Buddhists and Taoists being atheists, which is an oversimplification at best. Taoists refer to the Jade emperor as the ""first god"" for example, and Buddhists certainly believe in notions of a higher power even if it is stressed that belief in a creator God is of no help in reaching inner peace. In Japanese Buddhism there is even a pantheon of gods. No sensible person would call these people atheists.

&gt;In modern western contexts, however, atheism and rejection of monotheism are practically interchangeable

Atheism is rejection of all gods. The author is just more used to atheists from Christian backgrounds.

&gt;Roughly speaking, an atheist is anyone who has no use for the concept of God

I think most atheists see the use of the concept of a god. In my opinion (and the opinion of the dictionary), they are defined by simply not thinking there is a god or higher power.

Then he talks about the problems with organised atheism, which I think are overstated. I think people with common beliefs are likely to want to band together and discuss those beliefs. Here he is talking about belief despite having none but criticising others for doing the same.

&gt;This sort of atheism is one of the perennial responses to the experience of being human

null,false,Taure,null,null,null,"If the problem does appear, it will appear regardless of what the UK does, because global population (and thus global food demand) is out of our control and increasing far more rapidly than the UK population is. 

The UK is already dependent on global food markets, so there's no retreat into complete self-sufficiency now. If we tried to become self-sufficient it would mean increasing the primary sector economy, which is a low-value sector and would hurt our economy significantly (not to mention that the UK lacks a comparative advantage in agriculture compared to places like Ukraine).

So we have two variables:

Food crisis may or may not occur (depending on if technology advances as it has done in the past to increase agricultural productivity).

UK may or may not limit its economic growth.

This gives us four situations:

**Food crisis, economic growth**
The path you predict on our current course. In such a situation many around the world will suffer, but it's likely that the UK's wealth will shield us from the worst of it.

**Food crisis, no economic growth**
The path you recommend. The food crisis, absent technology increase, is inevitable because it's a global issue. The UK limits its population and thus economy in preparation, but the food crisis happens anyway. Our wealth is less than it would have been, so we're less able to use it to shield ourselves from the effects. 

**No food crisis, economic growth**
My prediction. We allow our population to grow and don't sabotage our secondary and tertiary industry in favour of safeguarding primary sector food production. Technology allows food production to grow in line with population. 

**No food crisis, no economic growth**
We limit our economy in anticipation of a food crisis that never happens, UK loses its international competitive edge out of over-cautious behaviour.

Global prosperity is increased if each country sticks to their specialist comparative advantage and then trades for what they lack. The UK's soil quality is not great compared to places like Ukraine; the world would be better served if those places predisposed towards growing crops grew crops and those places predisposed towards other things (like financial services) provided those.

You have also failed to understand that global food production is a hugely complicated interconnected supply chain. Much of the food produced in Europe is reliant on crops for less developing countries. An increase in their price has a knock on effect in Europe.    

&gt;arguing that increased commerce with a developing country harms it is just economic autism.

No you have just spectacularly failed to understand the situation. When the ability for developing nations to produce food falls, due to drought and soil erosion, and due to their own growing population needing to be fed, there is no increase in commerce. You cannot grow more food on less land. You cannot export more food when you population is growing. That is the whole point of the UN report I mentioned.

Not if the world actually does something about it in the 35 years we have to prepare. Taking pressure off the rest of the world by improving out own balance of trade for food would be a start. 

&gt;The UK is already dependent on global food markets, so there's no retreat into complete self-sufficiency now.

I didn't say we should be self sufficient, but we should reduce our reliance on imports. 

&gt;If we tried to become self-sufficient it would mean increasing the primary sector economy, which is a low-value sector and would hurt our economy significantly

Making sure the population has access to affordable food is a pretty central responsibility of the government. We don't expect the NHS or the pensions department to make money, but we have them none the less.

&gt;Food crisis may or may not occur (depending on if technology advances as it has done in the past to increase agricultural productivity).

The report I linked looked into the likelihood of technological advances and concluded that they were not enough to increase yield to the required levels. 

&gt;This gives us four situations:

You have come to your conclusions using a false premise. Increasing food production does not mean we will suffer from zero economic growth, or even see a slowing of economic growth.

This is just a matter of self-preservation of society.

He was better than Sturridge and Sterling in the Besiktas (away) game. That isn't saying much because Sterling and Sturridge were so bad because of their technical faults - bad touches, inability to hold the ball under pressure, etc. They aren't usually that bad, that was one off for both of them. Balotelli was okay technically, but what strikes me the most was that he didn't make himself available after he had passed the ball. At some moments he gave Sterling the ball and just stopped moving, leaving Sterling completely alone up front and that led to us losing the ball. That was also the reason why Rodgers wasn't happy about Balotelli's game in the Besiktas home game.

And also, I fucking hate all this comparison of leagues. Those players didn't do well enough whilst they were here and that's the long and short of it.

Lukaku is the only player I can see a warrantable argument over this, but then he hasn't been as good as his price tag might suggest, although I suppose he might benefit from the association trained fee. Either way, he's playing in the same league. And whilst the other teams may not have the exact same mentality they have against us, they make a far more reasonable comparison.

Playing in a completely different league is hardly a fair comparison of shit. I wouldn't expect Messi to get further than 30 in the PL. It's just different leagues and fans need to learn to deal with it better. They are literally leagues apart.

You need an appropriate passport, EU ID or other state approved document to move between countries within the EU unless these restrictions are weakened due to another agreement (e.g. Common Travel Area, Schengen.)

Someone from France could come to the UK under this simple case, no Schengen, no Common Travel area.  Hence they could use their French passport, their French ID card (and any other document specifically permitted by the appropriate governments.)

Now, someone from the UK going to France could also use their UK Passport, or UK ID Card... but this is the issue, we don't have a UK ID card, there's no longer any such thing.  This reduces our set of valid documents to just the passport. (in normal cases, there are others but it's confusing and rare.)

Finally let's consider UK to Ireland, there's an additional agreement here loosening the restrictions, meaning crossing the border requires minimal documents, you can read about that here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Travel_Area

Furthermore, whilst Schengen is meant to mean that there are effectively no internal border checks, this isn't true; I've been subjected to a border check whilst crossing from Spain to France on a local stopper service (i.e. no tourists.), bah.

So tl;dr:  No, the UK is not in Schengen.",null,0,null,1425645536,null,0,false,0,cp66o13,null,t3_2xxse7,null,t1_cp66o13,null,t3_2xxse7,null,null,null,1427610296,null,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2,null

null,false,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,null,"&gt;we have not been self-sufficient in food production in a long, long time

Not sure why you bring this up as self sufficiency is not part of mine or anyone's argument. Reducing reliance on imports, to shield ourselves from the effects of the ever increasing unreliability of the food market, as well as taking pressure off of developing countries with their own growing population and food needs is the reason to improve out own agriculture sector. 

&gt;the population increase due to immigration has not played a significant role in this issue

Again no one has said it has. But the GLOBAL population is increasing, and the issue of how to feed them all needs to be addressed. 

&gt;Ironically the farming industry we do have is very, very dependant on immigrants

You are going completely off on a tangent here. Why are you discussing immigration in the farming sector? It is completely irrelevant to the discussion. 

&gt;Food production should be done where it's cheapest (more sun/etc)

We have been doing this for many years, and it has lead to the soil in these countries becoming infertile, leading to reduced crop yields. These countries now have developing populations which need to be fed, and they are going to struggle to do so because we have taken advantage of them for so long.  

&gt;Most foodstuffs are part of global supply/demand - ie no one country has control over the market (unless specialised item only they grow - rare)

No one country can fulfil the worlds needs either. We have reduced the ability for many countries in Africa and South America to produce some of these foods, and that shortfall has to be made up somewhere. 

&gt;Growing more x in this country will not have any significant impact on the global market

The single most important thing you can do with a Carb'd bike is to keep the Carb bowls drained if your bike is going to be standing idle for any extended period such as 4+ weeks. If fuel is allowed to slowly evaporate in them then it leaves a solid which can trap the floats in the closed position, it's an easy fix even if you forget but the bike won't start till you reset or clean them.

To drain the Carb easily prior to winter storage just set your fuel cock to closed and run the engine for 5 mins, give it some revs to quicken if you are impatient. The Carb and the engine will fuel starve dry leaving the floats open for the next time you put fuel into it.

Carb'd bikes will also flood if dropped, there are a few ways to deal with this. One is to wait for the fuel to evaporate from the cylinders 5 to 10 mins or you can try start on max throttle no choke after waiting a few minutes.

Carb'd R6's have a much smoother throttle than the overtly twitchy FI versions which I prefer as it makes commuting much more relaxing.

Carb's are of course mechanical (well except hybrids) which means they are easier to fix that complicated electrical systems for your average spanner monkey.

null,false,ny-batteri,null,null,null,"Are you having a religious wedding or a civil ceremony? I'm not religious, but I have a big interest in ecclesiastical architecture, so I can tell you a bit about churches!

If it's a Catholic ceremony, there are the usual hoops to jump through (including marriage preparation courses, letters of freedom from your home parish etc) but you'll also need to get permission from the local administration (Diocese of Down and Connor). St Colmcille's on the Upper Newtownards Rd and St Comgall's in Bangor would the classic neo-Gothic style churches. St Colmcille's in Holywood and Church of the Immaculate Heart of Mary in Carryduff are the modern, round, whitewashed style.

If Anglican, one of the potentials spouses needs to be Anglican, and the nicest venues in your areas (moving west to east) are perhaps St Jude's on the Ormeau Rd, St Columba's on the Kings Rd, St Mark's on the Holywood Rd, St Philip and St James in Holywood, Holy Trinity at Glencraig/Seahill or Bangor Abbey (dates from the 6th century!). 

Most methodist and presbyterian ministers, as well as those of the smaller denominations, will be happy to marry you at their church or an appropriately licensed venue. First Presbyterian at Holywood is a nice building, with the old priory in front of it and lovely views across Belfast Lough. Some of the presbyterian churches in and around east Belfast (eg. Kirkpatrick Memorial, Stormont Presbyterian) are quite nice but the architecture in many others tends to be quite bland, as fits their theology.

One idea if you would be happy with a religious ceremony: the old meeting house in the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum at Cultra, Holywood. It's a preserved 19th century meeting house, very quaint and charming, but it's only licensed for religious weddngs.

If you're looking for a civil ceremong, disregard all that, and I'll run through what's available and licensed:

**Holywood**:  Culloden Hotel. Expensive (it's a 5 star hotel), has a reputation for being fancy, but is on the wane now. Was at a wedding years ago and it was nice, but i've heard mixed things since then. Lovely grounds and location, though.

Cultra Manor at Ulster Folk &amp; Transport Museum. Just up the road from the Culloden. It's an old manor house, quite a nice building with good grounds and the folk museum adjacent. 

Royal Ulster Yacht Club. It's a yacht club, as the name suggests, also close to the Culloden. Has stunning views over the lough, and I've been to a good birthday party there. Couldn't imagine having a wedding there personally, but perhaps worth a look.

**Ards:** You can of course marry at the council offices. Not a very nice building from the outside, but might be nicer within? 

Kiltonga Hall. Old meeting hall, recently restored. Lovely old stone building, would make a great intimate venue. Lovely views in three directions (bird sanctuary adjacent) but also has a steel warehouse behind it.

Temple of the Winds. Another intimate venue. In stunning grounds at Mount Stewart estate, with amazing views over Strangford Lough. It's an an interesting octagonal building. Two couples I know got married there and loved it.


Mount Stewart. You can also get married in the estate's manor house (no idea of the price, but I'd guess it's expensive.) It's a beautiful setting, hundreds of acres of gardens, no end of photo opportunities, and a very nice building inside, plus really fascinating history if you're into that kind of thing.

Strangford Arms Hotel. A hotel in Ards beside a shopping centre. Wouldn't personally recommend, but it's an option.

Scrabo Golf Club. Not keen on the fact that they built a golf club where they did (it's at the top of a hill in a forest park) but the views are amazing and you have Scrabo Tower nearby for photos. Golf Club food tends to be good, but I don't know about the venue itself.

**Comber:** Castle Espie. Wildlife Sanctuary. If you love birds, could be a good venue, otherwise, not sure why you would choose it!

**Dundonald:** No civil venues, unfortunately. Much as I'd love to recommend the place I grew up, there's not much here. There's La Mon, out towards Gransha, but that's the nearest. Decent food and I've enjoyed the times I've been, but nothing out of the ordinary.

**Bangor:** Council offices, again a possibility. In a nice building (Bangor Castle) but I haven't seen the inside so can't comment on the room.

Clandeboye Lodge. Nice hotel in nice grounds. Very popular though! Food is excellent.

Clandeboye Estate Courtyard. Very nice venue, as the name suggests, an open air courtyard in an old country estate. No idea about the catering, but I've seen pictures from events and they've been beautiful

**Crawfordsburn:** The Old Inn. Been to a few weddings here. Not personally fussed on the ceremony room (although on quieter days it's lovely). Grounds are stunning, right on the edge of the country park, and catering is top notch too. Staff very good as well. 

Marine Court Hotel: Town centre location, perhaps lacks atmosphere, but worth a look. Food is pretty good.

**Belfast:** City Hall is the registry office. Nice (a bit small, perhaps) and of course in a stunning building in the city centre. You'd need to go elsewhere for reception but it's far and away the nicest of the registry offices. Fairly popular so you'd need to book well ahead.

Belfast Castle. Beautiful Scots Baronial style manor house, with lovely views over Belfast Lough. Good catering, lovely grounds and surrounds. Obviously very popular too. The other side of town from your preferred area, but worth a look.
    
Malone House. Another manor house, recently renovated. Nice grounds, might again be a bit outside the area you're considering though.
    
Ulster Hall. Another city centre venue, beautiful old concert venue with big organ at the back. Quite big so might feel a bit weird if it's a small party, but they have charming upstairs rooms as well where I assume they could do the ceremony. 
    
Belfast Waterfront. A conference venue. Can't imagine it being a special wedding venue but if you're into modern architecture I guess it could be up your street.
    
Ten Square. Nice hotel out the back of City Hall. A fairly popular choice (never been to a wedding there myself but it's worth a look).

Merchant Hotel. Five star city centre hotel - widely regarded as Belfast's best. Would be pricey, but I'm sure it would be a beautiful event.

Titanic Belfast. Not sure where they'd marry you, but it's a Titanic museum. Wouldn't be my cup of tea (and I love history!) but it's an option.

Europa Hotel. Fairly bland city centre hotel, don't think it would be anything special based on the events I've been to.
 
Ulster Museum. Might be a quirky option, with Botanic Gardens adjacent.

Wellington Park Hotel, Holiday Inn (Ormeau Road), Malone Lodge Hotel, Park Avenue Hotel, Stormont Hotel, The Devenish, Cutters Wharf. All fairly bland hotels/restaurants. Malone Lodge probably the nicest, (on a sunny day, Cutters is nice as its beside a quiet stretch of the river) although Stormont Hotel is obviously close to Stormont Castle/Parliament Building and Dundonald, if that fits your criteria.

Crescent Arts Centre. A nice building, not sure what a wedding would be like there, though.
    
Queen's University Belfast. Beautiful building, can't imagine getting married there personally after studying there (would be a bit weird) but one to consider. They also do weddings at Ridell Hall, which is a beautifully restored venue with good catering.
    
Grand Opera House. Stunning Victorian music hall. Beautiful building inside. Would be quite something to get married there, but obviously a bit on the fancy (or theatrical) side.

Queen's Film Theatre. I'm a regular so I love the place, but I've no idea where you would get married or how it would work. Seems bizzare that they're licensed, but if you really love arthouse cinema maybe it could be for you?

Crumlin Road Gaol. Victorian prison. Not sure how you'd feel about getting married there but it's licensed so a possibility. 

Belfast Barge. Bit of a quirky one. A barge moored near the Waterfront Hall in the city centre. Been to a few gigs there and would be an interesting if unusual venue.

Best of luck! Hope that helps!

null,false,quinn_drummer,null,null,null,"Part of the problem is, and I speak from a London perspective that I'm aware is quite different to the rest of the country but has a growing population itself, is that all of the homes being built are massive complexes of £3m flats that they can sell to people over seas who have vaults full of cash. (There are 3 such blocks going up that I can see from my office window in Angel, none of which your average working Londoner can afford) It's not so much that immigrations drives up house prices, it's that the people buying the house have so much money that the prices go up. Houses etc sell for what people can afford, and if multi-millionaires are swooping in buying flats and houses for £3-5m a piece it's completely inflates the cost of homes for everyone else

Couple that with that fact an ""affordable home"" is determined to be 80% of market value, set by the Tories though Labour wasn't much better at 70%, and the fact social housing goes up with the private market rates now, it's impossible for people to be able to afford anything whether it's being built or not. 

If we do need more homes, the Government needs to be the ones building them and selling / renting them for way below market value to the people that genuinely need them, all over the country, not private firms throwing up luxury tower blocks to sell to millionaire Chinese business men.

edit: also, a passage on an essay I wrote recently about how class connects to place.

&gt; Housing is one of the seven factors taken into consideration in the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) which ranks the level of deprivation throughout the UK in each local authority.  This indicates that, in official statistics, class is connected to place because the IMD represents the inequality experienced regionally.  According to the IMD, three of the five East London boroughs that hosted the London 2012 Olympics are among the most deprived in England (Woodward, 2014, p.47).  One example of this is that in 2012, across the five Olympic boroughs and one neighbouring borough, 7989 households were living in temporary accommodations, with over 100,000 on the waiting list the previous year (Watt cited in Woodward, 2014, p.49).  It was the aim of the Olympic Games to leave a legacy that would regenerate the boroughs in which they were hosted so they ‘will have the same socio-economic chances as their neighbours across London’ (Watt cited in Woodward, 2014, p.49), and one of these areas was housing.  The Athletes Village was intended to provide 4000 new homes for the residents of the host boroughs.  After the 2008 recession, this number was reduced to 2818, with 675 allocated as social housing (Watt, cited in Woodward, 2014, p.49).  With housing requirements not being met and thousands unable to afford their own home, the inequality experienced in East London is defining the social class of its residents.

So you can see that there are 100,000 households, not people, households, in east London that need new homes, and all that accommodations built for the Olympics has basically been sold to Qatar (not references in the paragraph but that's what happened to most of it)
Also on housing from the next paragraph

&gt; This is also true for millionaire bankers living on Portland Road in West London.  They were able to use money given to them by the Government to bail out failing banks during the 2008 recession, to buy properties worth up to five million pounds (The Open University, 2014b).

The houses on Portland Road went up in price because bankers suddenly had more money! The banker they interviewed had the actual balls to stand there in the video and tell the interviewer that bankers had spent all the bail out money buying houses.

He did very little about Hancock's aide being arrested for espionage which highlighted a cavalier attitude to security, Clegg allowed him to stay in the party without investigation for a further 4 years until Hancock settled out of court in a civil action concerning sexual harrassment.

The other thing is to pay attention to *your* presentation at the interview.  Wear a suit and tie (done up!) even if it's from a charity shop!  Sit up straight, lean forward (it implies interest and enthusiasm) and don't slouch.  Try and think of a question or two about the company because they will ask you if you have any questions (but if you feel everything has been covered, don't be afraid to say so)

Finally, tell them you are keen!  Say something like ""I think this is a very interesting role and, if you offer me the job, I will definitely accept it"".  It removes a question mark, especially if you've currently got another job.  Saying this doesn't commit you to anything because you might have other interviews but it makes the interviewer think you are keen and bright.

&gt;

&gt;___Rita, Sue and Bob Too___ is a 1987 British film directed by [Alan Clarke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Clarke), set in [Bradford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradford), about two teenaged schoolgirls who have a sexual fling with a married man.  It was adapted by [Andrea Dunbar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Dunbar), based on two of her stage plays; *Rita Sue and Bob Too* (1982) and *The Arbor* (1980).  Its portrayal of ordinary people's lives made it a [cult film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_film) soon after its cinematic release. The [strapline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strapline) of the film was: ""[Thatcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher)'s Britain with her knickers down.""

With regard to people who shoot though I'm not quite so sure.

Clay shooting is very popular, but I'd say that game &amp; vermin shooting combined outnumber it significantly.

According to the most recent shooting survey, of the 600,000 people who shoot in the UK some 67% are involved in clay shooting, 55% shoot game, 54% shoot vermin (mainly woodpigeons, which are very tasty). This of course fails to take into account those who take part in multiple disciplines. For instance I don't think I  know anyone who game shoots who doesn't also shoot clays from time-to-time.

With regard to eating what was shot I'll just quote the relevant passage directly...

&gt; Ninety seven percent of all edible quarry shot was destined for human consumption; with 62% consumed by those who shoot or provide shooting,
and 35% used elsewhere, for example it was likely to have been sold to a game dealer or restaurant. Three per cent was deemed unfit for the human
food chain

So yeah, while game shooting is a niche sport it's not *that* small.

&gt;

&gt;The __tragedy of the commons__ is an [economic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic) theory by [Garrett Hardin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrett_Hardin), which states that individuals acting independently and rationally according to each's self-interest behave contrary to the best interests of the whole group by depleting some common [resource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource). The term is taken from the title of an article written by Hardin in 1968, which is in turn based upon an essay by a Victorian economist on the effects of unregulated grazing on [common land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_land).

&gt;""[Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_good_(economics\))"" in this sense has come to mean such as [atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide#In_the_Earth.27s_atmosphere), [oceans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pacific_garbage_patch), rivers, [fish stocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_stocks), the office refrigerator, energy or any other shared resource which is not formally regulated; not common land in its agricultural sense.

&gt;The tragedy of the commons concept is often cited in connection with [sustainable development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_development), meshing economic growth and environmental protection, as well as in the [debate over global warming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming_controversy). It has also been used in analyzing behavior in the fields of [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics), [evolutionary psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_psychology), [anthropology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropology), [game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory), [politics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics), [taxation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation), and [sociology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology). However the concept as originally developed has also received criticism for not taking into account the many other factors operating to enforce or agree regulation in this scenario.

It essentially removes dead space when speakers pause, whether for a split second or slightly longer, and it also speeds up playback overall. It means an hour-long podcast might only have 45-50 minutes of actual listening time, which is quite handy when you're listening to many hours every week.

The playlists feature is a little more involved than most other players too: you can prioritise certain podcasts within individual playlists so that their episodes are played first whenever available, before delving into the rest of the playlist.

I like the directory/recommendations too: if you're a twitter user it's doubly powerful because it shows you what your followers/followees listen to and recommend. This can lead to some quite serendipitous discoveries. It has a similar database to iTunes, and you can also of course just manually put in an RSS feed.

On the slight downside, the first two features I listed are only fully unlocked with an in-app purchase of $5 or about £3.

null,false,Its_me_not_caring,null,null,null,"No, but I can do math. The main problem is hat if you normally have say 150 spare pounds a month and now you borrow 450, next month you will be 300 short, so you borrow again and next month you are 190 short, so you need to borrow again. In this case it is going down but its not as short term as originally planned and it assumes that all goes according to plan.

Although somebody pointed out somewhere here that the rules changed and now the most you can be on the hook for is twice the original loan which drastically limits the downside - if it is true.

Have you tried applying for overdraft? HSBC processes those automatically and its available quite quickly. Credit card you probably will not be able to get soon enough if you do not have one already.

Also if you need 400 for 2 weeks, I assume its more than just for food. If its bills, call them and say you only can pay in 2 weeks  (its not like they will unplug you electricity or water in that time). Do not do it with council tax though, if you are on monthly payment and are late with one they will make you pay it all in advance [citation needed, heard this from a friend), but you can still call and try to postpone payment. 

Generally all creditors (with exception of payday twats) are generally not fond of their customers defaulting and contacting them in advance saying you struggle with one payment is likely to make them help you (mind you, in a way that does not lose them money, they are doing it for their own benefit).

Banks are trickier if you have loan payments, but still can be worked with - defaults only occur after 90 days of missed payments (at least it does at my bank, but I think thats mandated by the regulator and universal), but do not just stop paying, call first and ask what can be done and what would happen.

For a business with ordinary offices, paying anything from 500-1000/month *per person* in office costs is fairly normal in London, depending on number of staff, contract length, whether it's managed offices, and what facilities are available. Much higher is certainly possible...

An office with 5 staff @ 750/month would come to 45k in office costs alone. Tack on various other runnings costs of 5k (very conservative). Let's say salaries at 60k average per person (which I'm sure some would bitch about, but it's not extraordinary for London depending on type of roles), and you have salary costs at 300k and a further 37k-38k in employers national insurance contributions. Let's round down to 35k. That leaves a budget of 163k for travels, representation etc. which would be trivial to burn through with a regular schedule of speaking engagements.

I've personally spent about 20k/year on business travel with less than 10 trips in premium economy in average hotels, with just me. Him and the wife, an assistant and maybe a security person, a few more trips, business class tickets and slightly more expensive hotels, and you'd burn through 160k in no time without anything extravagant. 

Note, that I have no idea if he can justify the 550k/year for what I know that includes first class travel and extravagant hotels and burning dollar bills for fun, but the above numbers shows that it doesn't take a huge staff before burning through 550k/year on a relatively reasonable setup is easy. Maybe he's got no permanent staff and the office is just a mailbox, in which case, yes, it start looking like a lot. Maybe he's got 10 people. I don't know.

I'm a season ticket holder. Here are my answers to your questions, though someone else's might be different:

1.

No prices won't go up after March 31st. That is simply the deadline for the current season ticket owners to reserve their specific seat. In other words, if they don't renew before March 31st someone else can get their seat. Ticket prices will remain the same.

2.

This is something I have thought hard about previously. It's really dependent on you want to get from going to the games. If you want to be a part of the atmosphere, then the Holmesdale (specifically Lower Block A &amp; B) is for you. If you want a good view of the game, Main Stand or Arthur Wait are the stands you want.

Here's what I decided for myself... I'm buying a season ticket because I want to support the team I love. But I'm also paying a lot to watch a football game. I want the best possible view of that game. So I decided the Holmesdale wasn't for me (I was, however, previously a season ticket holder in Lower Block B). I now sit in the Main Stand.

Why does that work? Well, I get a great view of the game. No, I'm not standing and chanting non-stop with the Fanatics like I used to, but I'm still part of the atmosphere. And, really, it's nice to look over at them during the game. They're incredible. But a part of me still wants to be there chanting incessantly. Well, that's where away games come in...

The fans at away games are the fans in the Holmesdale end. Obviously I'm exagerrating here, fans in other stands also attend away games, but what I mean is is: when I go to away games I usually have a shit view (because we're in the away end) but I get the benefit of being part of the atmosphere. I can stand up, chant, and sing my heart out with the Fanatics.

So really I have the benefit of both worlds. Home games I want and get the view, away games I want and get the atmosphere.

Judging from the fact that you said the tickets you want are £550, I assume you're looking at the Arthur Wait Stand. That's a good choice - they sing less than the Holmesdale but more than the other stands. It's a wise choice if you want to get a good view and to also be a part of the atmoshpohere (just make sure you don't get a restricted-view seat!). 

And, just so you know, it's hard to get a ticket in the Holmesdale end - particularly Lower Block A and B, where the Fanatics are located.

3.

The payment plan is interest-free. I.e. you only pay for the cost of the season ticket. If you get the £550 tickets, it'll cost you £550 split into 12 monthly payments.

Factors include:

- Technological growth (allowing the same amount of land to support greater populations)

- Planning regulations (if we adopted loose planning regulations for high-rises then our cities could increase in population density significantly without having to encroach on countryside.)

- The production of the rest of the world. If all global food demand can be met by the rest of the world (or even just one or two regions of the world) then a very high proportion of the UK's food supply could be imported, close to 100%.

It was certainly the case for the wives of the Prophet (ra) and the early Muslims. 

  Also, in Islam there is a distinction made between fard and sunnah acts. Fare acts are obligatory actions, such as praying or going on Hajj, and are expected of all Muslims, and have their own rewards. Sunnah actions are not obligatory but recommended, and this gains the person extra rewards. Every Muslim is expected to strive to gain as many rewards from Allah as possible, so that their account in heaven is full of good deeds, and bad deeds are removed. Now arguments for the obligations of niqab aside, it is a common mutual agreement in Islam that the headscarf is fard (obligatory), but for me personally the niqab and chadari are extra optional methods of devotion to Allah.

So we can be kept in against our will? Or expelled when we want to stay? This would be stupid.

But it's quite not the same argument as for the EU. 
We are a 'family of nations'™ and such unique state structure should take into account that we are not a single unified country, but a mutually beneficial union of equal partners™ and make some provision for the fact that one of the countries is way way bigger than the rest.

The reason population size is meaningless is because it doesn't take into account what our output is

We are constantly producing more and more food every year, and all other resources to go with it. Problems arise when we expand quicker than our output. As long as we keep on producing more and more, which is happening thanks to advancements in the agricultural industry and others, then we are fine.

""Oh but what about power, and water""

Yeah, good thing about those is they can be expanded too.

null,false,petethepool,null,null,null,"SInce Pulis has managed West Brom Wisdom has been dropped - but that's less to do with Wisdom and more to do with Pulis changing system.  They've been playing a LM at LB, for instance. I think, too, Pulis is more likely to be looking at the long-term benefit of his own team, and so is less likely to favour a loanee over a West Brom player if it came to it. Wisdom (as you say) had the best first half of a season out of all the Liverpool loanees (aside from Ibe, who obviously earned a recall and so is no longer on loan)- he was the only player playing every game in the BPL for a start. I think if anyone can make it at Liverpool next season out of the current loanees, it will be Wisdom.  He's perfect for the right side of a back three, and he can also play CB or RB. He's composed and strong. His mobility isn't the best but I've always been impressed at how he plays the ball when I've seen him play. Plus he's actually trained with BR for at least a full season in the full team, so he knows what's expected of him. The season as a whole will still benefit him I believe, working with Pulis can not be a bad thing. Still, it's a shame he's been dropped at the moment.

I couldn't say who else I think will potentially make it out of all the loanees.  I just expect all the attacking positions to be fully nailed down by those already at the club - barring a big midfield signing (like a Pogba). Outside of a DM, CB or GK, I don't know where else the team is likely to be able to improve on its first 11 already (realistically I mean, based on what the club typically spend on individual players). 

So, in short, Wisdom, or possibly Ilori, might get some game time.  Ojo seems like one for the more distant future. I would expect most of the older (21+) on-loan players to be sold, or to go back on loan at better clubs (than they are currently on loan to), in the summer.

They're going for £20 and every person and their future kid is lining up for a ticket.

Trains are very frequent, £10 return.

Book well in advance and you'll be fine, Adelphi Hotel is central, lots of rooms. Ibis Styles is a really nice place to stay. Obviously there are Premier Inn's and Travel Lodges (the two big main budget hotels across the country) however these are pretty expensive the closer you book to. I remember the adverts saying how cheap they were, I turned up on their doorstep once and it was £120 a night for myself.

Another time I booked a month in advance and it was £20.

So yeah, book in advance. Hope I helped, any other questions about Liverpool just shoot.


Almost forgot - there's a Titanic Museum and various cool little museums like that, usually by the Docks.

I say you HAVE to visit the Cavern Pub / Club. You HAVE to if you visit Liverpool - it's an exceptionally cool place to go, they host open mics with various singer/songwriters and bands playing. Really awesome atmosphere. 'Birthplace of the Beatles' - so go there I'd say. Lot's of famous singers / bands have played there.



Edit - Oh I just reread what you said, I'm not 100% on memberships, someone else has to jump in and answer this but I'm pretty sure they have a requirement for the charity game as well as membership. So I don't think buying a membership will cut it, I heard somewhere you need to fit the required previous games. I could be wrong, don't take what I said as gospel - someone else needs to answer this (someone who has got tickets maybe)


Edit again - Obviously don't need to tell you to visit the LFC store. Visit the big one though, in Liverpool One. Not the smaller one by the square.

However, the point is that we can actually use vertical farms in areas that may not be viable for arable land... such as the Sahara.

He is a good player who took a risk coming to a big club which simply didn't work out for him. Chelsea is no worse off without him (check his impact since he got here [as compared to our current form] ) and he is no worse off without us (check his current form). Sure it would be great for our depth to have him, but in order for that to work out you really need a player who is okay with being a sub - not a quality that is often found in an ambitious and very skilled 22 year old. 

Sport is competition by definition. If you are not the very best at what you do, you will not play, that is a very simple concept. Does the fact that he didn't play often mean that we 'decided he is shit' - no, it simply means that Jose had someone he felt was better at what he does (in this case, a couple someones). Good players don't always succeed at great clubs, that is just the nature of any sport. If failure is to be placed, it would be placed on Salah for not proving day-in &amp; day-out in training and in the games he did play that he should be playing for Chelsea. 

The bottom line is, he came to Chelsea and left a better player with better experience and in a better financial situation.

 [**Bystander effect**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander%20effect): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;The __bystander effect__, or __bystander apathy__, is a [social psychological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_psychology_(psychology\)) phenomenon that refers to cases in which individuals do not offer any means of help to a victim when other people are present. The probability of help is inversely related to the number of bystanders. In other words, the greater the number of bystanders, the less likely it is that any one of them will help. Several variables help to explain why the bystander effect occurs. These variables include: [ambiguity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambiguity), [cohesiveness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesiveness) and [diffusion of responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility).

Main everyday difference is the choke. You'll probably forget a few times at first and wonder why it's not working, but you'll get used to it after a while and then not even think about it :). The carbs need cleaning occasionally but you can get this done at a service. You only need to drain it if you're storing long term, like over winter. If you go away on holiday it should be fine. I've always preferred to just ride it on nice-ish weekend days and clean the salt off rather than store it over winter anyway, but I lived in Aberdeen... the weather was shite year round! If you do have to go away, it's best to drain because it can get all congealed and jelly like up in there and cause a blockage later. Same reason you don't leave fuel in the tank. 

The other thing is the idle screw. If you're revs are too high or too low when you're idling, then you can adjust this here. I had to do that on my YBR. I went up, then down, then up, then down, but I eventually got it right, lol.

)

Most of this news is from companies and entities abroad and all within the last year or so. For a Chinese, American or German company, the destination they all seem to be focusing on the most is surprisingly Birmingham. This has mostly been below the radar nationally with little coverage. The most I've seen is fluff pieces about people leaving london to brum (it has Michelin stars you know!). Manchester is a more media-inclined city and if Birmingham was in a similar mold all this news would probably would be making a huge splash nationally. 

The next step is to just get the councils to agree to work together (apparently solihull will make a decision after the election) and if that happens, the government funding comes in like it has with Manchester, and the sky is the limit. 

But even if it doesnt, as a brummie I honestly dont see us losing anything, as long as we keep attracting overseas investment and creating startups and entrepreneurs at the rate we are, coupled with our very young population, it will slowly reorient the economy to be less reliant on London. The long term plans are already in place and many of the projects that have got us to this point are not even nearing completion.

This isn't considered buckling from a transport perspective though. Buckling is the situation seen on Southern rail or in many northern train services.

Certainly if the UK stopped its obsession with making London the focus of everything and encouraged people to expand elsewhere, it would make things better (having over 10% of the population concentrated in one city is a bit ridiculous).

But here's the thing right, on the underground you have trains every 2 minutes, the new tube for london, when introduced, will greatly increase the capacity of the trains. Then Crossrail will (hopefully) lighten the load across the network. TfL is making an operating profit which is being used to expand the network further - they are nowhere near buckling.

Read the reply I said to the other dude - she held a position of trust and power and in my eyes that variable greatly affects this whole second chance thing. You don't just give 2nd chances to every mother fucker, do you?

I don't know why you need to nit pick that comment of second chances, it's clear that it's all to do with variables, who, what, etc.

She had a career that was to uphold public safety, to be a member of society who you could turn to on the street if you needed help or were in danger, that lady that if you turned to for help, you'd trust her.

You're now comparing the UK to India, China and Brazil. But there's no reason to make that comparison; we're in completely different circumstances.

Yes.

But at the same time, you have to weigh your options. If you need the money, you are limited. Now that I'm more financially stable I don't get so tempted, but back when I was a student, I basically lived for 2 years with my overdraft and credit card maxed out. 

On the one hand, that's a dangerous game, but on the other hand, I don't quite know what I would have eaten if I hadn't used the OD/CC that way.

I'd also rather owe 2K on my overdraft to NatWest, than owe a tenner to wonga, 'cos Natwest won't try to intimidate me, and they also won't charge me as much.

As awful as it can feel, in these situations I tend to favour begging from family. You can even offer to pay interest, and it will always be a better deal than you'd get from a bank.
If family isn't an option, ask friends.

The compromises could be used to send out spam email, launch attacks against websites or servers, or install phishing websites to gain access to sensitive information.

&gt;The NCA estimates that organisations acting on this advice could, between them, clean up to half of the phishing attacks that typically originate from the UK each month.

So a load of twoddle, it sounds more like badly written ""The majority of SMTP traffic we see coming from the UK is from pwnt servers""

Banks like high value, long term, low risk lending, so are happy to offer relatively low interest rates. Wonga are offering the exact opposite, with incredibly short term loans (compared to, for example, a mortgage) and relatively high risk.

Totally irrelevant, borders are borders, if this was France we couldnt just start building in Spain. Or Hong Kong just start building the mainland without permission. Australia is an island too, would they be able to build in the middle of it? No? Why? Answer that and youll see how you have to factor in the local landscape.

&gt;Both are rich nations with a high level of development

As are many other countries, including many parts of the countries I listed.

Why is that relevant with Japan?

""Significant amount"" of greenspace is also far to vague to be of any use, you didnt mention how much of the UK is farmland, and where the available Greenspace would be in relation to where the housing crisis is concentrated (Cornwall might have plenty of fields, but its kind of stupid to build houses there to combat high prices in London). Japan also has large mountain ranges in a different distribution to the UK etc.

Japans housing grew around its economy (as in its a lot more dispersed unlike the UK were industries are concentrated in cities), has a shrinking population and no open border immigration, their cost of housing doesnt seem to be a problem and isnt a major issue with the electorate.  You cant pretend that were in ""similar circumstances"" when we arent at all. 

You seem to have totally missed the point of the issue and instead decided to divide the area of the UK by the area of a house and then forget the fact that people are talking about how it would affect *them*, I dont give a shit if things would work in 127 years if it means I have to pay more for the next 20.",null,0,null,1425657320,null,0,1425658205,0,cp6bick,null,t3_2y43i3,null,t1_cp6bick,null,t1_cp6anyn,null,null,null,1427612626,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Neville and Carragher debate zonal vs man marking off corners all the time and there is two schools of thought on it. Man marking is very clear and there is always someone to blame. Zonal is one big cohesive measurement and everyone plays a part. 

In this situation, **IF** the defensive structure Poch and his team calls for is zonal, then Bentaleb did his job, should have seen Routledge's movement across the box and picked him up. Equally, Davies' should have seen Siggy peeling and moved over to close that space. The blame, although not entirely his fault, is on Davies' awareness and failure to follow zonal instruction. But, if that cross dropped 15 feet shorter with an unmarked Routledge, they would have scored anyways.

**IF** the system called for man-marking (which I doubt), then Bentaleb was responsible for picking up Siggy and is more to blame on this. When I look at this, I doubt the system was man-marking as we see Bentaleb check his shoulder for Siggy as he peels, but he keeps on going towards the middle of the box. 


What should have happened is Davies' either screams at Vert that Routledge is coming into his space, and dropped off to get to Siggy, or Davies' and Bentaleb should have communicated the switch between Siggy and Routledge. Alternatively, Bentaleb could have hustled himself into the box, and allowed Davies' to drop off. As you can see it's hard to pin the blame on Davies' or Bentaleb completely. I personally would blame Bentaleb a bit more, but he is young and still learning so it's a fact of life that it will happen. 

If Siggy wasn't there in this circumstance, perhaps staying at the top of the area incase of a clearance, Davies' would have been correct to follow Routledge. And perhaps that may have been what Davies' thought was happening, if aware of Siggy at all. It was a good goal by Swansea to take advantage of the confusion. 

Edit: Germany's recent world cup qualifier and tournament is an excellent display of zonal tactics that disrupte teams in possession. They trained to the foot to remove passing lanes.

No matter how much Lambert wants it, he's not gonna be a key player for us. He was bought as a plan B and he isn't the type of player we can fit in our first XI regularly. Balotelli is in similar situation currently. If he doesn't improve in some specific areas like his off the ball movement/workrate he's not gonna be more than a plan B. He wasn't bought as a plan B, but it became clear quite quickly that he wasn't quite a good fit for our style of play (didn't fit like a glove). That's the reason why I think Rodgers didn't want him in the first place. When he was basically our last option he had to take it. He went from lose-lose to gamble situation.

And by workrate and movement I mean both - defence and attack. He's improved his pressing and defensive workrate but he still needs to do more in attack off the ball. He can't stay still after making a successful pass which he has done in last couple of games. I'm sure he and the coaches are working hard to improve him in the training ground. But he's gotta accept that until he's ready to work as hard **and smartly** as Sterling/Lallana/Coutinho/Sturridge he's not gonna be a starter. That's how it should be.

These sites will link you with recruiters who will bombard you with potential opportunities based on your skills/needs (e.g. graduate job). They essentially do all the legwork for you and they can sometimes bypass parts of the interview process for you in some jobs, although you should also seek and apply for jobs on those sites as well.

If you're looking specifically for a graduate scheme, then have a good browse of [Milkround](http://www.milkround.com). They have hundreds of grad schemes available to apply for.

Finally, for some interview advice, visit [Wikijob](http://www.wikijob.co.uk), or more specifically, the [interview questions](https://www.wikijob.co.uk/interview-questions) section.

Only you can answer that but in my experience pretty much everyone ends up in that trap if they aren't earning a surplus each month.

null,false,WarOnHugs,null,null,null,"Last season we started with Mata, Oscar, Willian, Schurrle and De Bruyne for two spots. It's simple math that one or two of them would want to leave for more playing time, especially in a World Cup year. So who leaves? I think in the context of last December we made the right choices, we kept the players that were most in form and seemed a better fit for our system (we also couldn't move Schurrle or Willian having both been signed in the summer).

You could make the argument that we should have kept De Bruyne longer (ignoring his desire to leave) based on his offensive stats, but that doesn't paint the whole picture. Does he perform as well in our system? Or when not being the attacking focal point? Or in the Premier League? For all we know he could have continued to play averagely for us even if given more chances. Consider Robben, we would be unstoppable with him but would he have become the player he is now if he had stayed at Chelsea? That's why the context at the time of sale is so important, we can't really account for or predict the future.

So no I don't think we've been letting players go too early, especially when we now have to sell to buy and we've made great money from some of them. Maybe we don't give some of them enough of a chance but Mourinho isn't that type of manager, he doesn't rotate for the sake of it, if it isn't broken he won't fix it.

All clubs have this problem, Shaqiri left Bayern, Thiago and Sanchez left Barca, Ozil left Madrid.

There's really no excuse for that sort of repeated bad behaviour. What contribution to wider society is this person making? It can only be a net negative impact.

And let's not forget, every single one of this persons crimes has a victim. If you've ever had your house burgled, it is a REALLY horrible feeling. Your privacy invaded in a gross way. You feel unsafe in your own home, which is very difficult mentally.

**Dramatis Personae**

* *Bert*, a Birmingham City Council person
* *Jocasta*, a central government person
* *Archie*, an architect
* *Rob*, a Birmingham resident
* *Thomas*, a travel guide writer

**Act 1**

*INTERIOR: central government office, London. BERT and JOCASTA are talking.*

* BERT: Hi. We want to make Birmingham a truly excellent vibrant place, deserving of the title of England's second city, and a player on the world stage. We're trying to get away from the nasty 60s concrete brutalist image and build a great location for the 21st century. To do that, we need some money. Can we have some money, please?
* JOCASTA: Ha ha ha ha! Give money to Birmingham? It's a shithole! Nobody wants to go there.
* BERT: That's what we want to fix! Don't you get it?
* JOCASTA: Ha ha ha you're so funny, you cute little provincial peasant. As if! I think we'll save that money and spend it on Covent Garden instead. Spend money on Birmingham? What a laugh.

**Acts 2 through 25**

(repeat Act 1, every year, with no success)

**Act 26**

*INTERIOR: Birmingham city council offices. BERT speaks to the assembled COUNCIL MEMBERS.*

* BERT: right. We know what we want to do: the [Big City Plan](http://bigcityplan.birmingham.gov.uk/). We never get given enough money for it. So, here's what I propose. We just *do* it. We'll find the money, somehow. And then we'll be a gorgeous vibrant city and not the 60s horror that everyone thinks we are. It'll take a long time, but I'm taking this decision, because I want Birmingham to be wonderful.
* CITY COUNCIL (ALL): Choo choo, motherfuckers! All aboard the Birmingham train!

**Act 27**

*Various BUILDERS, CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERS, ARCHITECTS, ENTREPRENEURS, STARTUP TYPES, SHOPKEEPERS, and the like enter the stage and build many things for many years, including the best and biggest library in Europe.*

* ARCHIE: OK, your library is finished, and it's amazing, and it's already winning awards. Can I have my cheque now?
* BERT: Er, yeah, about that...

**Act 28**

*SCENE: on the internet*

* THOMAS: wow! Birmingham is amazing now! I must write articles about how cool it is in every magazine and newspaper on the planet!
* BERT: um, you know how we built all this cool stuff? Now we haven't got any money to pay for it. Jocasta, can we have some money, please?
* JOCASTA: hell no. We're not giving any money to Birmingham. We don't care that people think it's cool now; we need that money to spend on the Royal Opera House and MP's expenses. Go whistle for the money. In fact, you can have less money than you had last year, because we think your city is badly run despite how you've made it pretty amazing. I don't know why we think this: perhaps it's because you're not in London.
* BERT: Dammit. OK, we'll have to cut a bunch of services to pay for things, because central government aren't interested in supporting anything outside London, and if we put taxes up people will complain. I am sad about this.
* ROB: bah, loads of cuts! Why are there cuts to everything?
* BERT: we know. We don't like it either.

It's kinda disadvantaged to the midlands as if you look at the methodology is connects settlements (houses) but not industrial estates, business parks etc (manufacturing and industrial estates are still huge (and booming!) here) which are excluded. So in a simple sense, two settlements are part of an urban area but if there is a huge industrial estate in between, they're not. 

For example the Manchester urban area excludes Wigan, but includes rural areas of Derbyshire which is not the same for the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester (the actual governmental urban area). It's the same case for Birmingham, it excludes areas like Coventry from the West Midlands county. The ONS is the only one that uses this new and separate classification. 

**All** other classifications put the urban area of Birmingham (and surroundings) as larger. If we are simply talking about cities boundaries (which we were) than Birmingham has 500,000 more people than Manchester. 

If we are taking about government defined administrative metropolitan divisions, like counties, than the West Midland county wins out again. If it’s EU defined administrative divisions like NUTS (Nomenclature of Units for Territorial Statistics) regions, than the West Midlands one is yet again larger than Greater Manchester. It’s also the case for EU’s ONS equivalent, Eurostat, which defines ‘large urban areas’ and the West Midlands/Birmingham one wins out again. 

The proposed Greater Manchester and Greater West Midlands regions that are to be created with elected mayors and extra funding etc should be our point of reference. In these, West Midlands wins yet again. With our young population, don't see how this is going to change much. Unless creativity is used around the borders again.

It is worthwhile and fair to ask question about it. But it's not fair to start drawing conclusions when the data is clearly lacking, given e.g. that he does not appear to have known about or taken into account that it seems at least part of Browns speaking fees are donated directly to charity rather than go through his firm, and given that we don't know how many (if any) staff the company pays.

Brown could be wallowing in luxury, or the vast majority could be going outside the firm and he could have a large staff paid peanuts to do important work.

The Guido piece provides no information to make it possible for us to tell.

It's really in how they talk about their fandom.  All the Everton fans (American or otherwise) I've hung out with really genuinely seem to like the team and the fans, what the club is all about (being connected to the community, scrappy underdog spirit, etc.)  A lot of top 4-5 fans tend to always just talk about how their team is winning or had won something in the past and how great that is.  It's only about results, stats, the best players, etc.  

For instance, my Man U friend loves to tell people how ""Man U is the most storied team in English Football"" and blather on about the legacy of Fergie.  That's fine I guess, but I feel like that's not a genuine connection or commitment to a team - but it just feels more like a business relationship.

If you set it up to pay off the full amount each month it literally doesn't cost you a penny. The credit card company still makes money as they take a percentage, 5% iirc, from the retailer for each sale. 

They are absolutely worth having for one reason: online purchases. In the UK you gain various legal protections when you use a credit card online. You are protected from fraud and benefit from the ability to have the card owner dispute the sale on your behalf. There are certain rights regarding refunds etc but I don't know the specifics. It's worth doing purely for that reason alone, I buy everything online with a credit card as do many others. 

WRT stigma, wonga is a glorified money lender, that dodgy person who lends cash down the pub then has your legs broken when you can pay. Though wonga do suffer from being the most famous; much of the more outrageous behaviour has come from other similar companies.

No, not every Muslim is an extremism, but these ideas are part of Islam.

Care to cite the relevant texts, because I can tell you now its thin on the ground as fuck. Hell the entire concept of Sha'ira is as doctrinally binding to all of Islam as a Papal Bull is to all of Christianity. In fact significantly less so.

The only thing that is REALLY objectionable in the Qu'ran itself is the apostasy stuff. Otherwise its pretty tame compared to shit like Kings. I mean pick a religion and I promise you (buddism included) you'll find people bringing in their own fucked up cultural shit and justifying nearly anything based on 2-3 lines out of context.

Yes, OK.  

From Wikipedia:

[Adultery](http://www.reddit.com/message/unread/)

&gt;Stoning is described as punishment in multiple sahih hadiths.[25][26][27] Shia and Sunni hadith collections differ because scholars from the two traditions differ as to the reliability of the narrators and transmitters and the Imamah. Shi'a sayings related to stoning can be found in Kitab al-Kafi,[28] and Sunni sayings related to stoning can be found in the Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim.[29] Based on these hadiths, in some Muslim countries, married adulterers are sentenced to death, while consensual sex between unmarried people is sentenced with flogging a 100 times.

[Homosexuality:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_in_Islam)

&gt;Sunan al-Tirmidhi, compiling his work two centuries after the death of Muhammad, wrote that Muhammad had prescribed the death penalty for both the active and the passive partner: ""Whoever you find committing the sin of the people of Lut (Lot), kill them, both the one who does it and the one to whom it is done.""[2] The overall moral or theological principle is that a person who performs such actions (luti) challenges the harmony of God's creation, and is therefore a revolt against God.[19]

[Antisemitism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_and_antisemitism#Hadith)

&gt;The Day of Judgement will not come about until Muslims fight the Jews, when the Jew will hide behind stones and trees. The stones and trees will say O Muslims, O Abdullah, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him. Only the Gharkad tree, (the Boxthorn tree) would not do that because it is one of the trees of the Jews. (related by al-Bukhari and Muslim).Sahih Muslim, 41:6985, see also Sahih Muslim, 41:6981, Sahih Muslim, 41:6982, Sahih Muslim, 41:6983, Sahih Muslim, 41:6984, Sahih al-Bukhari, 4:56:791,(Sahih al-Bukhari, 4:52:177)

Note, this is only 5 mins work, but I'm sure there's much much more.

And no, I'm not going to have a big theological discussion about context.  I'm well aware that a religious scholar can make a case that all of the above are really about flower arranging or whatever.

Simply pointing out, you want to make the argument for genocide. Kings. Kings is a story of genocide. Can and have 'Christian' groups done this, yup. Is that an incitement of Christianity no. Why does the same hold for Islam?

If we were having a chat about salafism, totally different kettle of fish, my point is simple. You want to warp relgious texts to justify insanity. Easy as fuck. Islam is no special case here. IT's just the case the the saudi's have thrown money at promoting a insane version of Sunni islam the last 40 years. And now apprenlty thats islam, because intelectual laziness. 

Also you haven't actually cited much of the actual texts there, just chunks of Wikipedia. With single sentences and *lots* of commentary. It's almost like its the same fucking thing i'm talking about no?

Also,

&gt;Adultery
Stoning is described as punishment in multiple sahih hadiths.[25][26][27] Shia and Sunni hadith collections differ because scholars from the two traditions differ as to the reliability of the narrators and transmitters and the Imamah. Shi'a sayings related to stoning can be found in Kitab al-Kafi,[28] and Sunni sayings related to stoning can be found in the Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim.[29] Based on these hadiths, in some Muslim countries, married adulterers are sentenced to death, while consensual sex between unmarried people is sentenced with flogging a 100 times.

&gt;Homosexuality:
Sunan al-Tirmidhi, compiling his work two centuries after the death of Muhammad, wrote that Muhammad had prescribed the death penalty for both the active and the passive partner: ""Whoever you find committing the sin of the people of Lut (Lot), kill them, both the one who does it and the one to whom it is done.""[2] The overall moral or theological principle is that a person who performs such actions (luti) challenges the harmony of God's creation, and is therefore a revolt against God.[19]

As I said, literally pick a religion. Go on, pick one.

By 'licence itself' are you referring to the date given at 4b on the licence?

If so, the article I linked to states that 4b only pertains to the photo. Expiration of the licence, therefore should perhaps be judged as 10 years from the issue date, 4a??

It seems the article I linked to post-dates the BBC article and seems to be aimed entirely at clearing up precisely those claims made in the BBC article, i.e. that whilst it is a *DVLA* requirement to renew the photo according to the photo-expiration date on the licence (4b) it is not in fact against *the law* to drive as the licence itself is still valid (i.e. within ten years of the issue date).

On the other side, there's a lot of derision, people criticizing essential parts of their manifesto such as downsizing the economy, free social care, and the total elimination of vital nuclear energy.

When you take all of that into consideration, I struggle to see how they are polling at nearly 7%, close to the Liberal Democrats. Am I missing something, or are their ideals really so flawed? As of right now I would advise anyone to not vote for the Greens, if my impression of them is in any way accurate I will continue to, but I refuse to believe that so many Brits are so easily led astray by fancy phrasing and obvious falsities.

Indeed I can, for there is reason to do so. 

&gt;it seems that there's a sizable minority of British Muslims whose views are bordering on the extreme.

This is how you evidently see things, which is the point I was trying to make. You're already predisposed to a particular line of thinking and seem reluctant to consider opinions contrary to your thinking. It's like the kind of ratchet effect seen in 9/11 truthers and other conspiracy folk, whereby any evidence contrary to their opinions is rationalised as further evidecne for a cover-up or whatever, in an attempt to minimise cognitive dissonance (or so I've been told).

Seriously, I'm not having a go at you for the sake of it, I genuinely don't think things are as bad as you fear. I appreciate that if they were, you'd be somewhat justified in being worried that there are members of islam out there who capable of taking over the UK and ruining everyone else's lives, but I think that simply isn't the case. 

There are a handful of nutters who's rantings get blown out of proportion in an attempt to sell copy/provide clickbait. They are a concern to me too in that they might provoke the gullible to violence. I'm pretty sure that there are a sizeable number of muslims who have opinions I find to be quite yuk, but that's not because they're muslims, it's because they're people.

If you want to find out the lie of the land, go out there and do so, don't rely on info from people with agendas. Go ask some muslims what they think. 

Apologies if you think I'm unfairly labeling you as something you don't like. I've no idea what your political leanings are, nor am I all that bothered. And I'm naturally suspicious of people who say things, think things, metabolise etc.

He doesn't even treat her like shit in a kinky, sub/dom sort of way, he is a legitimate bellend. ""I don't make love... I fuck"", then proceeds to have really close, gentle, passionate sex with her, taking her virginity, and wow, she likes him! What a shocker!

I think the solution to the issues many people have with this islamification scaremongering, is to look at the number of young people brought up as muslims who are becoming more secular.

You want me to condemn Salafism, fuck yeah, adherents are actually committing genocide right now, based largely on a fatwa from the 13th century about fucking mongol siege towers thats completely fucking irrelevant. If the U.N was not fucking full of pussies maybe we'd be doing something meaningful about it.

Your only real option is to go to the property manager and explain the situation - you are obviously a decent tenant and why get rid of a decent tenant to possibly get a crap one in? They may not realise you have been there all along. However I would guess they will be looking at refurbishing/renovating the property. You could ask them if they have anything else in the area if they do need you out. When dealing with the property manager - be nice, they wont do any favours for difficult tenants!

natives in employment for the period 1995 to 2010.

&gt;4.9 Table 4.3 presents estimates for the impact of migrants on the wage distribution in the UK. The majority of these studies find that migrants increased wages at the top of the wage distribution but reduced wages at the bottom. 

&gt;4.10 Dustmannet al. (2008) used UK data from 1997 to 2005 to estimate the impact of working-age migrants on the UK wage distribution. The results from this paper suggest that an increase of10,000 working-age migrants in the UK decreased average wages,by approximately £1 per year for the bottom 10 per cent of earners, but increased average wages for the median earner and the top 10 per cent of earners by approximately £4 per year and £5 per year respectively.

&gt;4.11 Nickell and Saleheen (2008) used data for Great Britain from 1992 to 2006 to estimate the impact of migrants on average wages by occupation group and by occupation.
Their results suggest that an increase of 10,000 migrants working in semi-skilled or unskilled occupations reduced
average wages in that occupation by around £8 per year, and that an equivalent increase in the number of migrants working in skilled production occupations reduced average wages by
around £15 per year. Migrants were found to have had little or no impact for other occupation groups.
Considering the impact by occupation, an increase of 10,000
migrants working in caring personal services is estimated to
have reduced average wages in this occupation by  approximately £25 per year.

Found a decent howto for the carb balancing.

You have to be able to control the dogs, but this can be difficult and they may decide to just chase and attack a fox, oops.

Hunts take place over private land, generally lots of fields owned by pro-hunt persons. There is NO power of entry for police, if the owner of the land says ""please leave"" unless they plan to arrest someone there and then they have to leave. How can they investigate if they get asked to leave before it starts?!

They need to prevent ""hunt groups"" meeting with horses and dogs where the aim is to chase a trail laid unless the dogs are suitably controlled to ensure they only follow a trail and if they go of course they can be restrained.

They also need to give police powers of entry to check that hunts are being conducted properly.

null,false,BraveSirRobin,null,null,null,"Technically speaking it's our war.

When we conquered the middle east in WW1 we took large swathes of it from the Ottoman empire. These had existed as provinces for centuries without much strife between them. We then carefully drew the borders to ensure that each new country had a good mix of groups, so as to play them off against each other. 

The Kurds are a great example, instead of being in the logical ""Kurdistan"" they got split between Iraq, Iran and Syria. We considered them a threat to our interests in the region and wanted to neuter them. The official intelligence reports from the era, now declassified, are quite blatant about this. Laurence of Arabia described it as ""a state of political mosaic, a tissue of small jealous principalities incapable of cohesion"".

The final part of this duplicity was setting them up against one another. Typically we'd select one of the smaller minorities and give them arms and money so as to rule over the other. Saddam is a good recent example there, he's of the Shia sect who are the minority in Iraq. We taught him how to torture and propagandise people and even went as far as helping him to gas his opposition.

Iraq is unstable literally because that's the way we intended it. It's operating exactly as designed. 

When we recently invaded Iraq for the forth time in 100 years we switched things around. De-Baatication laws were passed by our collation giving supreme power to the Sunnis. All Shias were entirely banned from any form of government service, from being politicians right down to being lollipop men. The Sunnis, pissed off after decades of Saddam, then took their revenge on the Shia regions where they now controlled local government, the police and the army. Essentially they operated as an occupying force, you can guess how that went. As allies of ours this of course was not widely reported on our media. 

Ultimately this is why ISIS has so much support in the north west regions of Iraq. Us helping the formation of ISIS in Syria is merely icing on top. But the cheery sitting proudly at the peak has been how we've managed to get our own population to believe that this is all down to fundamental character flaws of the people in the region when the simple reality is that it's a proxy war we created and nurtured for a century entirely for our own strategic benefit.

Pushing for a 7 way debate was good politics, but he may have overstepped in refusing to debate Miliband in a head to head and it has damaged him slightly. At present this will have little impact on his standings come May - his actions from here on out will, however   
Should he not attend any debates and the 7 (well, 6) way debate is a farce then he will probably look okay, justifying it by saying it would have been a waste of time. The resulting debate with Miliband would go ahead with Clegg in his place (probably), which would be seen as a cop out as Lib Dems are expected to tank in number of votes. There would be some discontent with Cameron but most people would just be annoyed that Miliband is bad enough to make them believe in 2010 Clegg again       
If the 7 way debate has a good showing, however, then the Cameron-hate train may be more significant as it would be the only point undermining an otherwise decent showing of democracy. It's difficult to say a leader's debate is official when the PM doesn't show up, and as it is entirely his fault he'd take the blame. It'd affect how the Tories poll I think, and it'd be a disaster. Any subsequent Miliband vs X debate would have little impact; unless Miliband declared his love of Stalin and did a strip dance in front of the prettiest girl in the audience, he could at least say he showed real leadership qualities by turning up whilst the PM hid in the corner.      
I still think Cameron will take the 1v1 debate though. Historically, debates tend to favour the Opposition as they can attack a record, whilst the PM can only attack ideas and proposals. With proper preparation and one liners, however, Cameron can use his superior debating skills to at least neutralise the in-built disadvantages he faces. Miliband would almost certainly come out of it better than when he went in to it in terms of public perception, but I don't think it will be massively different than it is now    
TLDR; Too early to say, dependent on the 7 way debate. If farce, then no. If successful, then yes.

Prison terms of &lt;12 months have a one year, [proven re-offending rate of 63%](http://www.no-offence.org/pdfs/1.pdf) (which may be due to the fact that those people used to get no post-release support at all), which goes down to 56% for community service, 54% for suspended sentences, 51% for 1-4 year sentences, 40% for fines and 35% for conditional discharges.

And over the last decade or so the prison population has almost doubled, with average sentences increasing.

You are making moronic statements like ONLY 15% of our food production comes from the developing world, as if losing 15% of our food supply would be anything other that completely catastrophic. This figure is also wrong, and you don't know what a developing country is. You should look that up first. 

You have also once again failed to understand the very basic workings of a supply chain. There are hundreds of foodstuffs grown in developing countries which make their way indirectly to the UK. You say that we get most of our food from the EU, but the EU itself is the worlds biggest importer of food, and much of that comes from developing countries. 

&gt; if the UK wanted to be less reliant on imports, all it had to do would be to export less

No, that's not how it works at all, and it just shows how little you know about global food markets. Every type of food we grow in this county is exported and imported to different degrees. As your own link shows, we have a deficit on every type of food except for beverages. That means we export and import the same things, but we end up importing more than we export overall. 

&gt;and the numbers of people undernourished are actually falling year on year, not rising.

Thats because we don't yet have a food crisis in this country, and thousands of food banks have opened in the last two years, meaning no one has to go hungry.

null,false,TheAnimus,null,null,null,"&gt; Shooting them is not illegal, so let's not pretend this is about pest control

I'm a fairly good shot.  I've lived in many places, some where hand gun ownership is the norm, rifles have never been my forte, shotguns, I'm average.  I was more of a pistol guy I guess, my 25m grouping would be described as very good, not competition grade, but well above average.

Hitting a fox with a gun is hard, they are small and quick.  What kind of gun are you suggesting?  Shotguns are normally used.  Ever killed anything with a shotgun?  I don't like it myself, there is a reason why you normally have a hunting dog.  At the risk of been graphic, it's because the 'shot' only wounds.  I felt like such a shit when I shot my first pheasant, but I'm a meat eater, so should be aware of my food.  The poor thing took a while to die.

Dogs on the other hand can be quite swift, if trained well, they dispatch the animal swiftly.

We could talk about rifles, hollowpoint vs FMJ but the fact is foxes are small, difficult to hit.  When I came back from spending some time in the states I hung some target shooting over a hole in the wall my new home had, I'm willing to brag about my shooting being slightly above average.  But I'd rather have a dog tear out my throat, than be shot by me from a few hundred meters.  Obviously, I'd sooner neither, but the fact is foxes create problems in the country side.

So, how about actually answering my question, which method do you recommend?  Myself, I'm probably more in favour of trapping, but I think banning hunting with dogs is entirely a fake political issue, it's a divide and conquer that relies on the kind of moral hubris afforded only to those affected by their moral consequences.",null,0,null,1425671658,null,0,false,0,cp6k48j,null,t3_2y53h1,null,t1_cp6k48j,null,t1_cp6jht7,null,null,null,1427616711,null,-8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-8,null

If Miliband said he didn't want to debate on one of the days because of cultural, religious or social reasons, they would have to reorganise to accommodate said request and not empty chair him. They have to take preferences as to when and where the debates are.

If Clegg said that he wanted to avoid a specific day because there was already a gigantic rally planned, they would be obliged to decide in advance a different date. They have to choose a date that everyone can attend.

Cameron has clearly and unequivocally said he will only take part in a debate in March. The broadcasters have to take account of this. Now, it might just be that their lawyers can work out a way around this so that it isn't an issue, but it is an issue. 

I don't know what the answer is, but the Tories have a hell of a lot of lawyers in their ranks and aren't stupid. They are expecting the broadcasters to back down, and they have some legal basis to what they are doing because they are not morons. Presumably the broadcasters have received different advice suggesting the opposite.

I have no idea, but the law isn't the sort of thing we make up ad hoc.

It might be worth getting a run though of options from like CAB / shelter but I suspect they wont be able to offer much at this stage.

The first property stage in the eviction process is the notice seeking possession, next is a court hearing, final stage is the eviction, it can drag out for months, so your not going anywhere you dont want for a while.

At some point if it goes ahead your going to need a housing solicitor (either shelter or CAB should be able to refer you)

Evictions are one of the few things still covered by legal aid but a solicitor probably wont consider looking at the case until the notice is served (as I dont think it becomes eligible for legal aid until then)

He was our best performer, standing out amongst a team that *was* mediocre. He was the only person on the pitch who looked like he would make something happen for us. When he went off we looked sapped of energy, and without Mario causing Besiktas problems they played much more aggressively and scored.

Of course, let's just forget that because Mario doesn't deserve any credit when he plays well, just to be slated when he plays badly. It should go both ways: point out the good and the bad in players. Pay attention to the context of how well the team is playing, too.

**Product claims**:
""Our Replenishing Rich Moisturiser is a perfect blend of multi- vitamins and skin-loving ingredients to keep your skin replenished and moisturised, and carries on working for 12 hours. Perfect even for sensitive skin.""

**About you**: What was originally combination skin, is now dry skin, as I worked out that what I needed was moisture. Prone to the monthly hormonal breakout, and a few tiny patches of eczema in the most irritating places (like my eyelids! ugh!), some CCs/blackheads, and hyperpigmentation (yay, melanin!)

**Your opinion**: The cream's texture is a lot lighter than I expected from soemthing that labels itself as a 'rich' moisturiser. For me, this is actually my light AM moisturiser that I wear under sunscreen, as I had previously been using the Simple KTS Hydrating Light moisturiser, which left my skin feeling tight and dry. 
No greasy residue, and contains some nice ingredients (glycerine being one of the top ones, lactic acid and urea also relatively high on the list. All in all, I am pleased! Definitely repurchased and is a part of my daily routine unless I find something that usurps the place of this product.

Also make enquires as regards disability benefits and grants - the Citizens Advice Bureau are usually helpful (as they are too regards the Equality Act etc). For example if you were to receive PIP, this could go towards paying for an additional train ticket or private transport. The test for benefits is not whether you can do something (or not), it's whether it is safe to do so.

If they advise there's no seats suitable for you currently, ask whether you can somehow utilise a space designated for a wheelchair, they are BOUND to have some. IMO you should have as much right to use a wheelchair space with a ""standard"" chair as a person with a wheelchair, or they may have a wheelchair to lend you. If they don't like the sound of that, politely go higher up the chain of management, and be prepared to supply a doctor's letter advising that in their opinion it is reasonable for you not to use average-sized seating.

null,false,rubygeek,null,null,null,"&gt; No, I'm not sure where you got your 500-1000 desk pcm from

From actual experience of about a dozen offices in London ranging from 5 people to several hundred, and in both services offices to long term leases, in both City, the West End and south of the river. [Easy enough to find articles that corroborate it](http://www.cnbc.com/id/100404237) (citing DTZ, giving $23,500 average cost per person per year for office space in the west end and $14600 for the City; with todays exchange rate that adds up to about 1300 pcm and 800 pcm respectively). 

First place I worked in the UK we rented office space at 800pcm per person. That was back in 2000 and was nothing fancy, though serviced offices in the City. Location matters a lot, and likewise does requirements for things like reception area, meeting room space, and other shared spaces, as well as services (cleaning, security) that may or may not be baked into the rent. 

You certainly of course *can* do a lot cheaper if all you need is a tiny space to put a desk, with no services provided, in less desirable buildings, but for most businesses that e.g. have regular client meetings or get to a certain size that's not viable as an office. 

Reception, copy room, canteen or rest room, kitchen, meeting rooms, board room, separate/larger executive offices very rapidly drives the cost per person up dramatically. As do property related services like cleaning, security and maintenance, whether you provision them yourself or they're included in the rent.

&gt; Absolutely agreed, which is why I mentioned it as this whole puff piece is doing just that.

But likewise is the Guido piece that is being used her to imply things that it does not create a basis for.

**Name of product:** Oilatum Natural Repair **face cream** (not the normal natural repair cream!)

**Price of Product**: £7.69 for 50ml, sometimes sold at a reduced price though!

**Where did you purchase**: Boots. Looked online for a cheaper deal, and it's more expensive there. 

**Product claims**: (Product description from Boots site) ""Oilatum Natural Repair Face Cream is an innovative new therapy specially formulated to intensively nourish and help repair your skins natural barrier. Oilatum Natural Face Cream is suitable for dry and sensitive skin and is free from fragrances, preservatives and emulsifiers.""

**About you**: What was originally combination skin, is now dry skin, as I worked out that what I needed was moisture. Prone to the monthly hormonal breakout, and a few tiny patches of eczema in the most irritating places (like my eyelids! ugh!) some CCs/blackheads, and hyperpigmentation (yay, melanin!)

**Your opinion**: When I first began using this, I couldn't tell if it was breaking me out or not. I was weary because the second ingredient is essentially olive oil, which can be comedogenic. However I've gotten through an entire tube of this stuff and I love it as a heavy PM moisturiser. It doesn't contain much humecant properties however, so you might like to try this in conjunction with a hydrating serum or lighter hydrating cream, and treat this as a more occlusive, locking in layer of moisture. I shall definitely repurchase, although I am thinking of trying CeraVe, as I have read that if this is slightly *too* oily for you (which it sometimes is) to try that instead. 

**Ingredients:** Aqua, Olea Europeae, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Palm Glycerides, Olus, Oleic Triglycerides, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Squalane, Betaine, Palmitamide MEA, Acetamide MEA, Sarcosine, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Sodium Carbomer, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum",null,0,null,1425676629,null,0,false,0,cp6n4aa,null,t3_2ohd33,null,t1_cp6n4aa,null,t1_cmn48f0,null,null,null,1427618127,null,3,false,SkincareAddictionUK,t5_32evd,3,null
