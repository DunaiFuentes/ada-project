The way I see it, there's two types of people who don't hate gays:

1. People who worked out for themselves that it's fine to be gay.  
   ""They're not harming anybody, so it doesn't affect me.""

2. People who believe it's fine to be gay because they were raised
   to believe it's fine to be gay.

Most people in this country are of the second type. People who would've been
religious in a different time, but now that there is no religion, the part of their
brain that craves religion and dogma finds something else to cling to. In this case,
they've appropriated something discovered by the first type, but then they've gotten
all second-type with it and made it gospel. You can't have an intelligent discussion
with these people: anything that goes against their beliefs is wrong, even when
it's a fact.

They're the same type of person who thinks it's ""racist"" to say someone is ""black"".
They've taken a theorem from people who were rational, but then they've made it
a belief. No rational thought.

You, in saying ""people can express their opinions, except when it disagrees with mine"",
are, well.... Ganging up on people you disagree with is something done by the same part
of the brain that likes having a religion. Someone who doesn't make decisions with their
emotions would see it and just move on.

If you actually watch him on QT he's saying that stuff like Isis will rise in times of economic turmoil, which is the 'water is wet' argument. Really not that controversial.

The article is correct regardless if you dont like the source, its actually pretty dishonest (but not surprising) the likes of The Guardian refuses to cover him saying it. I've seen the QT thing, what he says amounts to that, the problem isn't ISIS, the problem is the West. Noticed that pattern in his narrative? The problem isn't North Korea, its the West. The problem isn't Russia, its the West. The problem isnt Iran, its the West, and so on. Its appeasement and apologism. Somehow its never tyranny or radical ideology at fault, its always the liberal democratic West. This is a worrying narrative for a potential leader to have.

&gt; If you can't see how bitter that Telegraph piece is then you must be mad.

Compelling intellectual refutation of the abundance of factual events at which Corbyn has praised and honoured terrorism and the killing of British civilians and soldiers. 

&gt; RT regularly give more time for far-left candidates(and parties - see TUSCs extensive interviews). Could this be because there are many more far lefties in Russia than Britain?

They also give funding and support to far-right candidates. I think you'll find its within their interest as a widely-watched television channel influenced by the Russian government to push views that'd benefit the Russian government. This includes bringing to power openly pro-Russia parties (like Front Nationale in France), or appeasement parties/leaders (like TUSC/Jeremy Corbyn). This is hardly tinfoil hat shit, the media war between RT vs. the West is no secret. Most people find it really, really concerning.

&gt; I think you need to take the tin hat off.

I like the 4-2-2-2 option more because I think having one of Hendo/Milner more free to move up is really important.  The diamond would permanently shackle one of them into a very disciplined role.  I also really don't think any combination of these personnel at the same time can defend properly at all, there's no defensive structure what so ever.  It would be an absolute joy to watch them attack though.

It'll be really interesting to see what we do because none of these players will be remotely happy with sitting games out but I have a very hard time seeing them all make their way onto the pitch at the same time.  Until Sturridge is back we could potentially play Firmino up top and then have lucas sit at the base of the midfield between Hendo and Milner, and then Coutinho and Sterling in front of them, which I think would be the most stable way to start things out.  It's a bit harsh on Firmino though, he's not really striker and he'll be transitioning into the EPL so it could be really tough for him.",null,0,null,1436288429,null,0,false,0,csv58kf,null,t3_3cfayr,null,t1_csv58kf,null,t3_3cfayr,null,null,null,1437659481,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

Then you right down the barcode number.

Go home and print barcode number find very expensive similar item. Put barcode on and put in cheap item bin, ditch cheap item somewhere else.

Order cheap item, get very expensive item that no one notices as it has similar name and barcode matches (coz u changed it). Does not matter which shmuck picks, boxes or delivers it.

The only ""conspiracy"" here is the notion that it's a ""death cult"" and that their story is unique from almost every other group in history that wanted power. 

We are the ones giving ISIS the airtime. That they make their own videos is entirely irrelevant, it's hardly the first time that a groups own propaganda/training media has been used against them, just ask the US DoD where the only edifice involved belonged to some poor Iraqi detainee.

Youre probably right.

&gt;a fullback is for WIDTH so the attacking player in front has the ability to do what they are supposed to do which is attack and run into the box

I agree, and would argue that Iva doesnt  provide width effectively enough to allow Willian to make the afore mentioned runs.

&gt; the only reason Ivanovic has that space to get into the box is because Willian is giving width..... it should never be like that as I've said.

I agree

&gt;you seem to be ok with ivanovic being a right winger and doing all the things that Willian should be doing

Im not, which brings me to my original point. Willian is good at creating width, but as you said it should be Ivas job. If Willian has to create width instead of Iva and has to track back to help him on every play on defense dont you think we deserve a back who doesnt need that much accomodation.

&gt;before you say this I'm not laying all the blame on Willian, I also said he makes tons of balls into the box but nobody is ever there to tap it in, yet you felt the need to reply in the next comment with ""Willian constantly beats his man"" even though I never complained

I was trying to agree and didnt take it as complaining. I was commenting on the parts I was confused over. I think were on the same page that Willian could be improved.

Atletico have historically had good affiliations with particular teams where possible because it's more important for them to secure a good connection with certain income. This forms their transfer dealing framework, which they rely on, because they are in such debt.

Examples of Porto: Jackson Martinez, Falcao, Oliver Torres, Adrian and there's actually several more worth looking in to.

Examples of Chelsea: The Courtois loan, Diego Costa, Filipe Luis, and there are more that is failing me. Maybe Chelsea had first pick on Falcao before he went to Monaco.

&gt;The original point was if statistics show black people commit crime more then it's not racist to say it.

If that was your OP then it's fucking stupid because no one is arguing against that.

&gt;End point being either it's OK to prejudge on everything where the stats show it to be true or its wrong to prejudge at all

If you judge someone purely on their skin colour, you're a cunt. It's perfectly fine to judge someone on their character, actions and behaviour. At least to an extent. It's the opposite of prejudice. There is literally no way you judge someone purely on skin colour without being a cunt. It is the definition of prejudice. 2 completely different things. I'm astonished you cannot tell the distinction. I am talking about judging an individual though. The way you were judged as an individual, simply because you are half cast, and you were not judged on your character. It's not okay. Your argument in this regard makes no fucking sense mate.

&gt;End point being either it's OK to prejudge on everything where the stats show it to be true

What's the relevance of this stats part? I don't get it. It's wrong to judge an individual purely on their race and their race alone and nothing else. Judging someone based on a range of social, cultural and situational cues, as well as their behvaiour, character and actions is the polar opposite of prejudging someone. You're not prejudging them are you. If you judge someone based on their skin colour, you know nothing about them, therefore you are prejudging. If you judge someone based on how they behave, you're by very definition not prejudging them are you. You're judging them on what they are actually doing. That's literally the exact opposite of prejudging. It's far and away a much fairer way to judge someone.

Observe:

&gt;I don't like the look of that guy, because he is black

vs

&gt;I don't like the look of that guy. He's got a gang tattoo on his face, he's drunk, and is being overtly aggressive in his body language, and is loud and shouting obscenities some of which come across as quite threatening.

Do you see the difference between the 2? Have you worked out what the word prejudice means yet? In one, judgement is being made prior to any relevant information. This where the suffix ""pre"" comes into play. In the other, judgement is being made based on a range of relevant information. It is post-judgement. You literally *still* do not understand what the word prejudice means.

Hahahaha. I really can't tell if you are serious or not. First with your question about what sport I watch, then posting an article about how Baines, Sagna and Rafael are among the best fullbacks? Ridiculous.

The best fullbacks currently are players like Alaba, Rodriguez, Jordi Alba, Lahm, etc.Why? Because they can both attack *and* defend at a very high level. You think these guys don't prioritze defending? You think Lahm, when playing RB, ever gets stuck half way up the pitch when his team is being attacked? No, his positional sense and recovery is top notch, which is *why* he is among the best fullback in the world. Same with Jordi Alba, who is another great attacking fullback, but also amazing in defense because his unreal ace constantly gets him back into a defensive recovery before the other team can exploit him. This is called prioritizing defense. None of these guys would leave themselves completely open on defense because they bomb forward and can't get back in time.

I found it astounding that you truly think that fullbacks, even ""modern"" ones such as Lahm, Alaba, and Jordi Alba, don't prioritize defending.

&gt;Hello Hardwareswappers.

I am selling a Saitek x55 Hotas Joystick system, this a system which has been used around 2/3 times. I unfortunately don't have the space to use this equipment effectively, therefore forcing me to sell it. The Joystick and Throttle are basically brand new like i said earlier, they have been used only two or three times. It comes with the box and all accessories. 

Price: It was bought on Amazon for £160. Seeing as it is in perfect condition i would be asking for around £110. I can include postage in this price!

When you work in close-knit teams in stressful clinical environments, people become acclimatised to doing things a certain way. Where I've worked, I feel we had a positive, supportive and open culture. We had strong and visible clinical leadership. Standards were high, and we were motivated. We are human, and work in a difficult field (ED), there were errors, but things were followed up. 

But just as easily, you can swing the other way, and develop a culture of tolerance towards low standards. It starts off with laziness, cutting corners ([such as the utterly ludicrous example of taping babies dummies to their faces on paediatric wards to keep them quiet at Mid-Staff](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/jan/25/police-mid-staffordshire-hospital-baby-dummy)). Seemingly innocuous incidents, increase in frequency, increase in severity. Bit by bit, standards drop, people start getting hurt. And the staff don't notice that there's a problem. ""It's how we've always done it"". Because nobody comes in from outside, things don't get discovered until it's too late. Things like this happen.

There is wide-spread ignorance of how to deal with learning difficulties in healthcare. It often unhelpfully gets lumped in with mental health. I can appreciate behavioural difficulties can be frustrating for the staff, and highlights something to improve. Things were slowly beginning to change just as I left my old job, where they'd managed to join up the learning difficulty nursing team's system with the hospital's patient record system, so we'd know who had learning difficulties. And whether we'd need to let them know so they could send somebody. But that was the extent of the support we had in acute/emergency care. I hope it was the start of real change, but I doubt it quietly at the back of my mind. Put simply, the lack of support for those with learning difficulties in acute hospitals is a significant problem in the NHS.

For those suggesting the NMC intervene, the article doesn't say if those responsible were registered in the first place. They could be healthcare assistants, who are non-registered nursing auxiliaries. Obviously not to demonise them as a staff group, as I myself am one. If they are Registered Nurses, then they can have their registration removed and never work again in nursing. If they are unregistered staff, then there's not much to be done besides sacking and a bad employer's reference.

It's sad to have to say this, but my gut says these kinds of things must be the tip of the iceberg. The extreme examples end up in front of the courts, but there must have been a long chain of events that allowed this to occur.",null,0,null,1436291226,null,0,false,0,csv77w3,null,t3_3cepo8,null,t1_csv77w3,null,t3_3cepo8,null,null,null,1437661129,null,15,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,15,null

&gt;As the title states, Ill copy my descriptions cause these are on some other sales sites.

~~* **HD 7970** My Gigabyte HD 7970 which is factory OC'd to 1000\1375 clock speeds, I've had it for just over two years (bought in March 2013) and have never had any problems with it, in great condition and I'm only selling as I'm upgrading my PC, have used the MSI afterburner software to make sure it runs cool at all times, it can be flashed with the Ghz Edition BIOS like other 7970 chips but this hasn't been done to this card. 

The model is the GV-R797OC-3GD if you want to research it. 

Still have warranty until late March 2016 I believe, was bought from Overclockers UK, still got the box and stuff to send it in. 
*Timestamp* http://imgur.com/a/9sSGI (I know it's a bit of a terrible photo but it's currently in a PC, if there needs to be a better one Mods please say). 

**Asking for £100 shipped.**~~

* **Schiit Modi and Magni DAC and Amp**

Up for sale is a Schiit Magni desktop amplifier, with it's companion the Schiit Modi USB DAC!
 
I am the second owner of both, and they are both in great condition, minus one scratch you can see on the Modi, but is invisible if they are stacked, I am selling because they just don't fit my current computer placement, and think I may downsize my setup as I mostly use IEM's now, aswell as to free up some funds for a GPU upgrade. They did however, sound spectacular with my Soundmagic HP150's. I bought them both in January of this year. and they have probably been sued for 4-5 hours only since then.

**Asking for £85 shipped.**
 
If they are bought as the stack, I'll include shipping in the price, however I can sell them for £40 each plus delivery.
 
Feel free to ask me any questions!

As the title states. Ill copy my descriptions cause these are on some other sales sites.

~~**HD 7970**~~

* **Schiit Modi and Magni DAC and Amp**

Up for sale is a Schiit Magni desktop amplifier, with it's companion the Schiit Modi USB DAC!
 
I am the second owner of both, and they are both in great condition, minus one scratch you can see on the Modi, but is invisible if they are stacked, I am selling because they just don't fit my current computer placement, and think I may downsize my setup as I mostly use IEM's now, aswell as to free up some funds for a GPU upgrade. They did however, sound spectacular with my Soundmagic HP150's. I bought them both in January of this year. and they have probably been sued for 4-5 hours only since then.

**Asking for £85 shipped.**
 
If they are bought as the stack, I'll include shipping in the price, however I can sell them for £40 each plus delivery.
 
Feel free to ask me any questions!

You're volunteering to get behind the wheel but you're not volunteering to get rammed into by another driver. You can't control that so you get a seatbelt. In cricket, you *know* that the ball will get hurled at you, and you can stop playing if you don't like it.

&gt; Just because you voluntarily do something where there's risks involved doesn't mean the governing body shouldn't implement rules to mitigate the chance of harm

You can only do that in sport by changing the rules of the game. That solution is ridiculous because it's essentially saying 'I want to play the game but I don't want to play the game because it's dangerous so change the rules'. If you don't want to get hurt, don't play the game.

&gt; Are you saying accidents only happen when other people are at fault? Or when laws are broken? I'm really confused by that

In driving it is. If you do your part, eveyone else does their part, no-one breaks the rules, there will not be an accident, pure and simple. That's not how it works in sport. Even if everyone is playing by the rules, everyone is getting along, the crowd is dandy, the ball is still getting hurled around and could injure you. But *that's part of the game*.

Have a read of this article and prepare to be shocked at the level of complicity that the UK government has acting as sales agent, promoter and middle man for arms companies to countries like Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Indonesia. Essentially they don't care about how the weapons will be used just that it results in sales contracts for UK defence companies. And with the export credit guarantee in some cases the UK taxpayers have footed the eventual bill when the buyer refuses to pay for their new guns or planes or tanks.

Interesting excerpts:

&gt; The first tentative discussion regarding the addition of a more experienced coach was 12 months ago – after Liverpool finished second - when former Manchester United number two Rene Meulensteen was a genuine contender. Rodgers was not keen then. He did not feel it necessary on the back of such an excellent campaign...Meulensteen would later wreck his chances of a fresh approach by publicly criticising Rodgers’s lack of an experienced number two.

This explains why Rodgers got a new contract after 13/14 but his staff didn't.

I want to see large amounts of nuclear to cover baseload and the expanded requirements we'll see from electric vehicles and heat pumps. And eventually get coal off the grid. 

I want to see wind, lots more wind. Both off-shore and on-shore. Lots more solar, ideally on target for 22GWp by 2020. Need continued price reductions here, but I'm optimistic. 

Lots more interconnectors, to take advantage of other countries strengths - French nuclear, Scandinavian hydro and in the long term solar from the south and geothermal from Iceland. 

6 or 7 tidal lagoons as well please, that could cover up to 6-7% for the next 120 years. 

We really want to reduce the gas used by powerstations, it's extremely inefficient (we only get 40% delivered). Much better to use gas for home heating in a 90% efficient boiler. Also it's useful long-term for balancing renewables and filling shortfalls.

I don't think it'll be enough to make a dent in climate change unfortunately, but I'm trying to be optimistic. Long-term we're gonna need more advanced nuclear technologies to do the heavy lifting required by modern society (home heating and transport). Seeing some interesting stuff coming out about how the incredible computing power that will be available in the next two decades will help model a lot of the engineering problems we're facing. 

Plus lots more efficient and smart technologies to reduce final demand.

On the other hand, my experience with the NHS, when i have used them, has been negative and fraught with problems and misdiagnoses, both personally and in observing others' experiences. I wouldn't have NHS-level healthcare in the united states if it came with all the gold in Fort Knox. because imo, I would then have no healthcare to speak of at all.  That's how bad NHS healthcare looks in comparison to what I receive in the USA and will continue to receive when I switch to Medicare.  I am particularly bitter because one of my closest friends from childhood died under NHS care, and I am absolutely certain, as is her husband, that she would be alive today if she had simply availed herself of American healthcare.

I have to say that I think it's you who have the Stockholm syndrome if you think all the anecdotes on this thread represent any high standard of care.  The NHS is nice in theory, but in reality it is sub-standard care.

null,false,DBD420,ter-falklandIsles,Falkland Islands,null,"""London comes together"" - speak for yourself. I am a bit tired of the constant state of perpetual mourning every week about something tragic happening.

1 year on, 2 years on, 5 years on... ""we remember."" Do we? Do all of us remember? Not in the literal sense, of course; that would be stupid. But what about this, now 'mediacised' word, about ""remembering?"" Do we all remember? All of us? What is our obsession with symbolism? Poppies, phony ""remembering"" (as if it means anything other than the literal sense of the word), minute silences. Why can't we just all accept that bad things *have* happened and bad things *will* happen.

This isn't a disrespectful post. I am simply saying that for the majority of us it is difficult to get emotional about an event and to be told that we ""**must**"" mourn, and that we ""**must**"" remember is rather missing the point of rememberance. It forces people to feel something they simply don't.

Today my office had a minute silence. It was awkward, it was unpleasant, and the majority of us thought that compulsory ""rememberances"" go against the whole point of one. During the Rememberance Day silence, I was in the toilet. I didn't wear a poppy, nor will I ever. Not out of a lack of respect - on the contrary. I don't need to symbolise my ""respect"" for the armed forces by way of a £2 donation that I can wear.

Why do we need to publicise our grief and respect to show that we are a good person?

It is sad that people died so needlessly, but we ought to get out of a culture of ""remembering"" things for rememberance sake. Liverpool fans have practically forced the FA to make sure absolutely no-one forgets Hillsborough, like it is Liverpool's Holocaust, but with 365 days a year you will be hard pressed to find a day where something bad hasn't happened. We should leave each to their own and let individuals decide what to ""remember"". Not everyone wants or feels the need to remember 7/7. Not everyone should feel forced to feel something they don't.

It's not consistently. That's where this is blown out of proportion. We are only weak on the right after a quick counter attack. You fix that by giving the ball away less. Not change the tactics you want to play.

&gt;Never said that, nor do I think that.

That's what people are implying when they claim he lacks defensive ability. What makes anyone think we can find a player who can play forward then magically appear back to stop a counter attack after we give the ball away?

&gt;Never thought Id hear that. Plus how many crosses do we really score from open play?

Do you believe if you don't score from a direct cross it was a useless cross? And we scored a few goals from Ivanovic crossing. But once again it's more than just scoring.

&gt; Whether one day the UK equity release mortgage market will accept lower ages than 55 is yet to be seen. The problem with accepting an age below 55 is the protection provided by the ‘no negative equity release guarantee’. This ensures that at the end of the day the beneficiaries will never end up owing any more than the sale price of the property upon death or moving into long-term care. The cost of this guarantee has to met and is paid for by the customer by way of a slight increase in the equity release interest rate. With no guarantee in place, then we would see lower interest rates in this sector.

&gt; Therefore, until these issues are addressed there are currently no equity release schemes for people under 55 years offered by any of the mainstream equity release providers that are certified by the Equity Release Council

If they want to be part of the ERC, they need to have a minimum age of 55. So that covers off pretty much all the main providers. It's just some dodgy ones that aren't part of ERC that are doing it from what I can see. 

It seems odd that there are a lot of websites quoting the minimum age is 55, when there is no real rule preventing it being younger, just it being the standard by all providers.

EDIT: Bank holidays


Bank or public holidays do not have to be given as paid leave.
An employer can choose to include bank holidays as part of a worker’s statutory annual leave.

Working part-time


Part-time workers are also entitled to a minimum of 5.6 weeks of paid holiday each year, although this may amount to fewer actual days of paid holiday than a full-time worker would get.

Example

A worker works 3 days a week. Their leave is calculated by multiplying 3 by 5.6, which comes to 16.8 days of annual paid leave.",null,0,null,1436296194,null,0,false,0,csvar8s,null,t3_3cgbuc,null,t1_csvar8s,null,t3_3cgbuc,null,null,null,1437663648,null,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1,null

null,false,joepo32,null,null,null,"&gt;Iva is good when we play a compact defense, with four man midfield in front of that. Thats where his ability excels. Recovering his position is his biggest flaw. And it isnt blown out of proportion. It happens practically every game. 

Because no player can recover his position being that far forward during a time we are pressing. We then rely on 3 defenders. Of course it does. And it will no matter who we put there. Every defense has a weakness when you try to play attacking football. Do teams score every game because of it? 

&gt;It doesnt take magic to get back into position after we lose the ball. Just some positional awareness and athleticism. Players like Alves, Alba, Lahm, Alaba and Zabaleta do it all the time.

All of those players still get caught forward at least once a game during a quick counter attack because the team gave up the ball. It happens. Its a risk you take by playing this way. 

&gt;As far as crossing goes, Iva is not a very efficient crosser or passer. His best attribute is using his physicality to get at the defense, which has been extremely useful dont get me wrong. But Id rather have someone who is capable of providing possession and attacking threat. 


Yes he is. He sends in the majority of our crosses. Do you think there is no reason for this?

Let me break it down for you. When you post a comment generalizing Japanese women, and I come for you and tell you that I'm a Japanese woman, and you respond by informing me that I'm ""automatically not the kind of person you're talking about""--what you're doing there, rhetorically, is two things: you're denying me my identity as a Japanese woman simply based on your incomplete and obviously racist unrelated-party perception, and you're singling me out as ""one of the special ones"" and expecting this 'compliment' to get me to agree with you and validate your shitty racist beliefs. Both of these are patently insulting and I strongly suggest you think about them real hard before you pull this shit again on people who don't fit into your little mental race categories.

null,false,NervousEnergy,null,null,null,"Hi, employability advisor here; I have created loads of CVs for clients.

Your CV is bit too wordy! No recruiter is going to wade through paragraphs and paragraphs.. they're on a really strict time limit with maybe 100+ CV's in front of them

* You 
* Need
* To 
* Have
* Bullet
* Points

I'd have something like: 
&gt;Employer

&gt;Job Title

&gt;Date (Right justified)

&gt;Short, two sentence max blurb summarising what you did (one line max)

&gt;Bullet points of key skills and responsibilities

Have you ever been involved in projects during work that showcase your skills, trustworthyness, etc etc? You can add in a **Projects** section and detail these for some extravalue. You also don't have a **Skills** section; a recruiter isn't gonna wade through two pages to see if you match the table of attributes they have in front of them: add in a short section detailing your major skills. Use examples so it doesn't seem too generic but keep it really short and to the point.

How are you applying to jobs, anyway? It's pretty rare for job adverts to *just* accept CVs these days... most employers that have an online application process that require a *Personal Statement*. Your work history paragraphs on your current CV are *perfect* for those types of things; they usually want fairly lengthy paragraphs detailing your role (it's just not appropriate for a CV). 

Probably the **most important** part of online job applications is the *Personal Statement* section. Here is your time to shine: its basically like the covering letter of old; your putting a bit of personality and context into the application. If you have a Job Description from the advert at hand (and most jobs tend to.. maybe not for low level stuff but, they should at least have a few paragraphs on the job advert page detailing what the job is about) then the Personal Statement area is where you **bang** through all the keyskills/job requirements/specifications, showing for each and every one how you meet this. If there isn't a full formal Job Description, then use the paragraphs mentioned previously to talk about how you fit each and every attribute they are describing. 

USE EXAMPLES! This is the most important thing of all, really. *Anyone* can say they are, for instance, 'excellent with people with a high standard of customer service'. But what recruiters need is evidence of this, so explain *why* you're good at customer service, and what you've done in work/personal experience that shows this.

If your applying for a job that *doesn't* have an online application form, or is missing a *Personal Statement* section, then use a covering letter to detail all of the above.

Also, you should personalise each application/CV/covering letter to the specific job you are applying to. usually this only requires a few changes here and there, but a *really* good tip is to research the company online: they usually have an *About Us* or *Corporate* section, or maybe even a mention in the media. Slot this into your application! Is there mention of a Corporate Plan, or training/qualification opportunities for staff, or maybe they fund community charity events.. how many stores/locations/offices do they have, how many employers? When were they founded? Recruiters fucking love this: it shows you CARE and are INTERESTED in the company, that you've done the 15 minutes of effort to do some research. It'll really stand you out from other candidates.

But back to your CV; you said you're applying for mainly minimum wage type jobs in retail and bars: ironically you might seem overqualified for these types of roles, so I'd recommend pairing down your CV to the essential skills, qualities, and experience that match the job in question. Applying for a bar job? Add in examples on how you've dealt with conflict, how your fast and flexible to work, with good maths/money skills. **Remember examples**. Hell I'd say for these types of jobs you can probably do the entire CV on one page. (this advice also applies if you're doing an online application, keep it really to the point).

Other advice: don't include your birthdate, nationality on the CV. Obviously this is fine if the online application form asks for these. Is your email address professional? I've had clients with *lovesboobs13@hotmail.co.uk* as their 'professional' email address. If the online application form says **not** to include CVs, don't fucking include a CV.

Hope that helps!

Granted, we've made some questionable signings, they're heavily outweighed by good ones.

We've only sold players in the aim of progressing our club as a whole, take Ben Davies and Bony for example. Davies got us sigurdsson and created a good relationship with Tottenham which enabled us to get Naughton later on.

Bony's money has got us all of these exciting signings and enabled us to build squad depth. I can't recall the last time where we've had this squad depth. 

Furthermore, I think there's currently a rumour circling that Huw Jenkins has said we have to sell one of our players and its pointing towards a midfielder (Shelvey/Ki). I would be upset with either of them going but its in the name of progressing our team.

Also I think Monk recognises value for money aswell, in the winter transfer window he stated ""[It's] a cattle market and everyone's selling all their cows and they're overpricing the cows - some of them are bad""",null,0,null,1436297240,null,0,false,0,csvbhqi,null,t3_3ce5f7,null,t1_csvbhqi,null,t3_3ce5f7,null,null,null,1437664316,null,1,false,swanseacity,t5_2tip4,1,null

She's never asked me to make her look older but this is what I'd recommend based on what she looks like seeing we don't have a picture of you. 

Muted colours as opposed to bright colours. Bright colours might make you look a bit younger. Avoid bright pink lipsticks, bright coloured eyeshadows and I'd say skip blush all together. Muted reds, pinks, mauve and brown lipstick will probably be best. 

If you've got a fair complexion and pink undertones, try dark brown eyeliner and mascara. It might look more natural. I think nice wings might help. To help you create perfect winged liner, invest in an angled eyeliner brush such as the MAC 266 or Zoeva 317 to use with gel liner like Maybelline's Eye Studio or a felt tip liner such as Stilas all day eye liner.

Find a foundation that you like, thats quite important. Match colours to your neck to find the best fit.

Contouring might really help! If you have a baby face, definition might really help. To start with, try Sleek's face contour kit and a contour brush. A nice one comes in the real techniques face set which you can pick up for around 15 pounds of Amazon. Look up contouring tutorials on YouTube and practice practice practice! 

Lastly, take things one step at a time and have fun with it. Be careful to not go overboard as that can make you look older in itself. You didn't tell us what your skin tone is or what your budget is so its hard to make recommendations. If you give us more information and maybe a photo that would help a lot.

null,false,Kesuke,null,null,null,"Other posters in this thread are mistaken. Restricted titles in the UK fall into two categories; Regulated professions and regulated professional titles. Regulated professions are things like calling yourself a doctor or an architect and are strictly regulated, typically requiring registration with a regulating body (like the General Medical Council). Regulated professional titles are things like ""Chartered Land Surveyor"" which can only be used by individuals who have membership of specific professional bodies... and typically membership of those bodies requires specific exams to be passed. 

Professor in itself is not actually a restricted title, so anyone can call themselves a professor... however it's a bit more complex than just that. 

If an individual used a title to mislead another person into buying something or undertaking some action when they do not posses the implied professional credentials, it could be classed as misrepresentation (basically the legal term for deliberately deceiving someone). For example, if your colleague claims to be an esteemed professor of economics, and convinces someone to invest in his company on the basis of his credentials, when infact he is only a trainee accountant with a visiting professorship at an A-level college where he teaches home economics to 17 year old girls, then that could obviously be classed as misrepresentation.... had the investor known he wasn't really a ""real"" professor of economics (for lack of a better description) they probably wouldn't have invested.

 [**Hand of Omega**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand%20of%20Omega): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;__The Hand of Omega__ is a fictional device from the British [science fiction television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_on_television) series *[Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)*.

&gt;In *[Remembrance of the Daleks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_of_the_Daleks)* the [Seventh Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh_Doctor) explains that the ""Hand of Omega"" is the mythical name for the remote [stellar manipulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_engineering) invented by [Omega](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega_(Doctor_Who\)), the first of the [Time Lords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Lord) of the planet [Gallifrey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallifrey). Omega was a stellar engineer who used the Hand to create the [supernova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova) which would be the power source for the Gallifreyans' experiments and subsequent mastery over [time travel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel). The supernova appeared to consume Omega, but instead shunted him into an [antimatter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimatter) universe. It subsequently collapsed into a [black hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole), the [nucleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_singularity) of which was harnessed by Omega's colleague [Rassilon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rassilon) as the [Eye of Harmony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_of_Harmony), giving the Time Lords the capability of time travel. In homage to Omega, and in keeping with their alleged ""infinite capacity for pretentiousness"", the Time Lords dubbed the manipulator the ""Hand of Omega"" (despite the device looking nothing like a hand).

The difference between getting hit and not getting hit is *you* catching/deflecting it, which you're supposed to do as part of the game.

&gt; I'm sure early cricket players didn't wear padding, at least they weren't forced to, but that changed when the governing bodies decided to step in for the safety of the players

And footballers wear shinpads, ruggers wear mouthguards. But you can't keep adding bits here and there every time an accident happens or else they'll turn into Iron Man. The cricketer that died was struck in the chest, the only way to prevent that is with body armour, which is silly when players need to be running around. The poor fellow was a batsman, who needs to see the ball, swing his body with the bat and run a few yards there and back. Like you said they already do wear lots of padding, so what more do you want?

&gt; Haha, what? So mechanical failures don't cause accidents? Or ice? Or wildlife? Blown tires? I understand your other points you make, though I don't necessarily agree with them, but this one is just not right

Ok, I'll concede that these cause accidents, but we're keeping to the analogy here. There is no equivalent of a mechanical failure in sports that causes accidents. But even mechanical failures in cars is a strange point to make: regulation certainly requires cars to be safe to use, and maintenance is the responsibility of the owner, so what would be the solution here? You can't just say 'make them more reliable', cos it is certainly in the manufacturers' interest to make as reliable as possible, and they wouldn't consciously make them susceptible to failure. It's the same with blown tyres.

With someone with extensive employment history like you, I'm a fan of sectioning out your periods of employment into specific roles. [Here's a link to a section from my work-in-progress CV](http://i.imgur.com/1j8Vgrc.png) (work-in-progress because I thought I'd have to get a new job but didn't in the end, so never actually finished it. It's a bit rough still, for instance the font choice is a bit shit.)

Hopefully you can see that it's short and snappy and really to the point. The time to expand on all that is the interview or the online application, not the CV. Again, for online applications, you can pretty much use all of your written paragraphs in it. My employment history sections for online applications are about 500 - 800 words each where I go into real detail.

There is an argument to make that online applications should be pretty wordy; not only because online is easier to digest that paper, but also because HR software searches for keywords to match against [Job specification], so the more keywords you put in the more matches you might have. However, low level jobs probably don't have this type of software.

Now, I work with clients who have learning difficulties or zero employment history or qualifications, so my usual advice isn't very relevant for someone with your background. However..

Projects could include your specific examples of policing the Jubilee and Olympics; you can go into a bit more depth here on the specific things you had to do for these events that *set you apart* from your colleagues, and how you dealt with exceptional circumstances.

null,false,[deleted],null,null,null,"Just to clarify some points on UK knife law.

Firstly, I'm not a lawyer. This is for the purpose of informed *discussion*. This is not legal advice. **Don't rely on anything I write.**

It is not *generally* or necessarily unlawful to carry knives. I carry a knife practically every day, quite lawfully.

It's unfortunate that headlines such as this suggest otherwise.

There are two areas of legislation that are of particular concern here.

CJA s139 says that you require a Good Reason\* to carry (in public) anything bladed or sharply pointed other than a folding pocket-knife with a blade length (""cutting edge"") of at most 3in. (Stupid) legal precedent is that in order to be a ""folding pocket-knife"" it must be ""readily foldable at all times"" - so locking folders are not included.

Offensive Weapons legislation says that you need a Reasonable Excuse\* to carry (in public) anything made, adapted or intended as a weapon. So given intent (the last bit) this can include absolutely any item, including an S139-exempt folding pocket knife. But intent is something any prosecution would have to show (this is largely why SJA s139 was introduced). Furthermore, some knives (eg balisongs, automatic knives) are considered de-facto Offensive Weapons, and furthermore are generally banned from sale, import, etc.

(There are also rules about airports, schools, etc, and there may be assumptions made about a knife at, say, a football match. So as the disclaimer above says, don't **rely** on this, though this should be *generally* correct for everyday purposes.)

So, I generally carry a sub-3in non-locking folding pocket knife (such as a Swiss Army Knife - though be aware some SAKs lock or may be too long, so not all are exempt). I certainly don't intend it to be a weapon (nor is it made or adapted to be). So this is lawful.

On occasion I may carry a non-S139-exempt knife, but only when I have a specific, demonstrable Good Reason to do so.

\* Which you need to show. ""Self-defence"" in most cases doesn't count.

I think something that hasn't been mentioned really is that Willian was new to wing play this season and has shown in several matches that he's a much stronger attacker when he plays centrally. I think having him on Ivanovic's wing where they can both pour into the attack and both track back in defense has benefitted each of them hugely in his first season out on the wing.

To quote [Citizen's Advice](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/about-us/how-citizens-advice-works/media/press-releases/scottish-power-most-complained-about-energy-company/):

&gt; * There were 1,163 complaints about Scottish Power per 100,000 customers in the last quarter of 2014: the latest period for which data is available.

&gt; * This is the highest number of complaints ever recorded about one energy firm.

&gt; * Complaints about Scottish Power increased 588% throughout 2014.

The next most complained-about company is nPower, who have 599 complaints per 100,000 customers.  So ScottishPower are roughly twice as bad as the next-worst, who are pretty dire as it is; the average is 258.

Anecdotally, ScottishPower supply the company I work for.  We've not actually managed to get a meter reading to them for over a year now, since for some reason their system thinks there are six meters to get readings from at our site (there aren't - there's one).  Naturally, their system can't take a single reading, it needs a full set.  And like fook are we going to give them made-up numbers for non-existent meters.  Needless to say, we're making our very slow way through their complaints escalation procedure now...

Its not so great, really.  A 0.06% increase isn't really very impressive.  Its not a big number and when taken in context, its is a victory but a slightly sad one to crow over.

The Conservatives have ended up with a slight overall majority, boasting that they are the first incumbent party to increase its number of seats since Thatcher’s Tory government did so in 1983.  Mind you, as they had to form a coalition to gain any sort of power in 2010, they *did* do better this time. 

The party increased its share of the vote since 2010 by just over half of one per cent – from an unspectacular 36.05 per cent to 36.7 per cent.

Last time the Tories won a parliamentary majority, way back in 1992, John Major got 41.93% of the vote.  Lets face it, John Major was hardly the most charismatic leader the Torys have ever had, he was following in the tainted footsteps of Thatcher and he still did way better than Cameron.

In 2015, Only 24% of those eligible to vote actually put a cross next to a Tory candidate on their ballot paper.

Rounding it all up for fairness and lets face it 0.06% isn't very much of anything, It leaves a 76% of people we have no reason to believe support the Conservative government.  3/4 of the voting population did not want the Tory's in power. Tories got just 37% of the vote by turn out, but 50% of the seats and ALL of the power.  

Its a fairly hollow victory really when you realise most of the people in the UK didn't want them in power.

The simplest thing to do is to give false information when filling in forms, this immediately invalidates it under the Data Protection Act which stipulates the data must be accurate and up to date. It's tricky and our government is deliberately out to get us. They want Total Informational Awareness. That's the end goal of all this. They sell our information which we are obliged to hand over to access services our taxes pay for. It's a pretty bad situation and none of the big parties have an issue with it.

It's been going on for more than a decade. I got involved in NO2ID in 2004 / 2005 which wasn't even one of the 'early' anti-surveillance groups. I'd argue the war on citizens has been going on since at least the 1980s when Racal become Vodafone and the idea of spying on people rather than armies became more of a thing thing. Expensive mobile phones were naturally going to be owned and used by high-wealth individuals which mades them perfect targets for being spied on. Economic espionage made easy. It's not one overarching plan, it's just a general push by lots of smaller groups in a roughly similar direction. It's unnerving how complicit our elected politicians are in the process over a relatively long period of time. Then again they did manage to cover up kiddy fiddling and murder for more than a generation so God knows what other skeletons and useful blackmail material are in their collective closets.

As for wage they asked me and we had a brief back and forth. Here's what I know that might help you (I'm 4.5 years experienced in AAA with an advanced diploma). The numbers I'll use are in GBP not CAD.

Currently I'm paid 31.8k which is quite low for the area and Quebec pays some of the lowest wages across Canada and US. Locally a more fair wage would be about 40k. I told them I expected 45.8K in my next roll and the recruiter at the studio kind of jumbled on his words a bit but came across to saying essentially ""Well, not sure if you know this but Canadian studios pay much higher than in the UK but I'm sure we wont have any problems. hahahaha.""

I expect they're going to offer dramatically lower than 45.8K based on the recruiters nervous laughter. I'm not too worried though since my project right now is pretty great even if it's not well paid. I'm near the offer stages with Bethesda and am talking to two different teams at Blizzard too. Some random studio in California is claiming they would pay me 87K but they're a really unknown studio and they didn't make that offer - they just said that's what senior positions go for there and they have unmatched compensation. I'm taking that studio with a grain of salt.

That is the problem though, lots of these people aren't alienated, or if they are it is by their own doing. As was mentioned, the failed Glasgow airport bombers were a NHS Doctor and an Engineer. What possibly could we as a society have done to stop these men? People who we took into our country as immigrants and allowed them to succeed far beyond most white working class people. 

I don't deny they may feel alienated, but the source is not us. The source is the toxic islamist ideology which is normalised in many mosques and communities, even if in most cases it doesn't lead to violence.

Firstly Deobandis are very orthodox, but they aren't violent extremists. So what they teach in terms of Islam is analogous to Orthodox Juddaism along the Hasidic model. Secondly Deobanbadis are VERY South Asian, mainly because the school of thought flourished during the Raj period as the whole movement started acquiring funds and establishing itself. Thirdly, they're really old demographic, so you tend to get men in their 50s or older that congregate around a certain mosque.

So in terms of young men being radicalised it's not really the Deobandis that are the ones doing it. Lots of these young men see them as old mosque uncles who are behind the times and don't want to spend much effort listening to them. 

The issue is that they create inertia within the mosques that can't actually do anything about these young men, simply because their own orthodoxies bind them, and prevent them tackling the problem fully - they either get rejected as being too old, old are ideologically incapable of laying down a challenge to the more radical groups.

1. Get a format. Your CV is very boring and while that might be all-right in a technical job for most jobs it'd be overlooked. Basically make it look pretty or at least eye catching but don't flood it with shit.

2. Cut the fat. So many paragraphs and sentences. Try and limit this. Maybe 3-5 bullet points about key responsibilities (tailor these to the job you're applying for if you wish. i.e. if a job you are applying for requires a lot of teamwork then emphasize your teamwork abilities through your previous jobs) 

3. Key Skills. Got anything you're particularly good at? or skills you've picked up while in previous employment? put these here. A bit like your qualifications section but encompassing more abilities.

4. Who are you? One of the key aspects employers look at when short-listing CV's is info about the person themselves. Put something about your interests and hobbies, what you do in your spare time etc. Try not to put anything fucking weird.

The authorities have always been rather reluctant to collect any data on this.

In any case, the exclusion of locking knives from S139 exemption is not because anyone ever made a decision that these were more dangerous or more likely to be used in crime, but simply because a judge decided that ""folding"" meant ""non locking"" and specifically ""readily foldable at all times"", in the face of common terminology and similar examples (eg a folding umbrella).",null,0,null,1436304563,null,0,false,0,csvgm4u,null,t3_3cfnmg,null,t1_csvgm4u,null,t1_csvandx,null,null,null,1437668331,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Unless you already have a membership then it won't be possible to get one tomorrow, and you will have to wait until they go on general sale (which, iirc is usually about 2 weeks before the match takes place), it can be pretty variable as to how easy it is to get tickets in general sales, depending on what time the match is on (midweek games are usually easier, and in all honesty, how well the team is doing at the time). I think there will be Europa league games around the time of the Swansea game, so the chance of that game being moved to Sunday or Monday will be pretty high, which should make it easier to get a ticket to that game at least

However, it is possible to guarantee being able to buy a ticket if you choose to do one of the hospitality packages (where you usually get a meal at the ground and a match ticket, I think), however you would be looking at &gt;£100 a ticket for those.

My advice would be to check the [LFC Tickets page](https://tickets.liverpoolfc.com/PagesPublic/Home/Home.aspx) fairly regularly, for matches going to general sale. And then the morning that there is a general sale, make sure you are at a computer for the sales to open and just get any ticket you can.

Obviously, if you do have a membership, then just make sure to log in tomorrow morning on time, and for the best chance of getting *any* ticket, I would try and get something in the Anfield Road stand. It isn't the stand with the best views or atmosphere, but it is the easiest stand to get tickets in",null,0,null,1436304969,null,0,false,0,csvgvo1,null,t3_3cgzzg,null,t1_csvgvo1,null,t3_3cgzzg,null,null,null,1437668533,null,19,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,19,null

Got me my first though so *shrug!*. And of course can only describe what I've learned for essay-based courses only:

1) Read the literature, journal articles and academic articles from reputable sources. It's not about the quantity - but pay attention to it. Learn how they use language. You want to be able to write like that.

I once overheard a professor at one of the top 10 unis in the UK say they could usually tell whether an essay was going to be a first by reading the top page. It's how you articulate yourself that demonstrates how much you've read over the course (and let's be honest, the depth you understood). It is a massive advantage to you, and in my personal opinion with some of the more 'critical courses' that let you interpret and analyse things with 'no right answers' it is just as important as what you're actually even writing to argue.

2) Try to learn what leanings your professor has. Not the obvious stuff - it'll be an offhand comment like ""some might argue such-and-such, if you're feeling a little more adventurous in your reading"" or ""some refer to the arguments of X if you want to be black and white about it"" that just give you a little insight into the discussions that they find interesting. Write about that. Another underhanded way to do this is to look at their faculty page on the schools' network and see what they've written their papers on and allude to those schools of thought in your own reading. You have to be EXTREMELY subtle and careful about this and use it with a pinch of salt. If they're writing loads about championing trade union engagement and participation in HR management you can be a little more free with taking a more left-leaning stance on your own essay's argument. 

2) Try to learn what the popular arguments in your class. Write your essay accordingly. If it looks like everyone is going to take a similar argument against an essay question, try to undermine that by critically analyzing the ways that popular argument is flawed. Your essay will stand out more after you've marked 20 papers all arguing against the rising popularity of complementary and alternative medicines, at least it will be refreshing to read ""In my paper I'm going to argue against this, but NOT using the conventional arguments as they don't appreciate x, y, z."" or even ""A common knee-jerk response is to argue against the rising popularity, but actually I'm going to demonstrate this is short sighted because x, y, z"" - the downside to this one is you've got to actually read the books, know your stuff and be half decent at writing to be able to really hit this one home but it's a great tactic when you're trying to think of an angle to approach the essay.",null,0,null,1436306621,null,0,false,0,csvhy6b,null,t3_3bzcgf,null,t1_csvhy6b,null,t3_3bzcgf,null,null,null,1440493562,null,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1,null

Usually they also demand the value of a month's rent upfront as a deposit (which you should get back if they deem you've vacated the house in a good condition, but look out for biting cleaning fees at the end of the tenancy). Sometimes the deposit can even be six weeks rent+, though that seems to be a London thing.

null,false,[deleted],null,null,null,"&gt; When you say 'carry a knife around', what if it's at the bottom of your bag, or something like that? Does it have to be 'accessible' in order to fall under this rule? 

The rule covers possession in a public place. This includes in a bag or a vehicle that is in a public place. It's important to note that CJA S139 does not require any intent to use as a weapon - even if everyone agrees you did not intend to use it as a weapon you could still be convicted under S139.

If a blade is less accessible then it may help assure a police officer that you don't have malicious intent, which I suppose may help against a potential Offensive Weapons charge or generally help with how the police use their discretion, and is likely to be better than carrying it on your belt, but I really wouldn't rely on it!

I, personally, would certainly not carry such a knife without a specific Good Reason. Furthermore, I think a sheath knife in particular is likely to result in trouble (moreso than, say, a non-S139 exempt multi-tool).

I would consider what I used it for and whether a S139-exempt folder might work instead. There are some fairly substantial non-locking sub-3in folders made largely for the UK market nowadays. Personally (as someone who fairly often uses a knife) I'm suprised that you have frequent tasks for a 6in blade (that a smaller blade would not be capable of, or even better at) without having a specific Good Reason.

null,false,PhilipTheLion,,Hartlepool United,null,"We have had a great close season so far with Ronnie being able to bring in 8 new signings after letting go 9 players that were not up to scratch.

Of the new signings, I am most excited to see Carl Magnay and Harry Worley line up in defence, as the both seem to be big strong lads with plenty of pedigree. Trevor Carson is also a cracking signing in goal. Also, Worley was an absolute legend on an old Football Manager game of mine, so I might have to get myself a shirt with his name on...

Also excited to see Rakish Bingham get a good run in the side, lad looks talented from what I saw of his loan last season If his finishing improves he could be a great signing. Looks like he never really fit in at Mansfield, hopefully he'll do the business for us though!

Also intrigued to see which Billy Paynter we have signed. This signing is a huge gamble in my opinion, he could be the player he was for Port Vale, but I worry those days are over. He did a pretty interesting interview with the Carlisle local paper once he left their discussing how he felt undermined by their manager, so hopefully he'll feel as though he has a point to prove.

Big worry though will be our new owners, most importantly who are they? Why do they want to own a small football club in the North East? Whats the deal with our chairman who has previously been declared bankrupt? And most importantly, how much are they going to spend?

Not willing to guess where we will end up this year just yet, as I still think we are two or three players away from having a full squad.

I would have thought with his clout if he wanted to get into owning a football club he would've done it a while ago with a much more established club already in the Champions League and with a larger global fan base to buy shirts. Plus, he's 77 and stepping down as Nike chairman next year so seems he's winding down to enjoy some more free time. But then maybe he enjoys a challenge and is looking for a new hobby??


Just done a quick search though and this is getting bandied around on other forums too.

So what I did was assume that every employer only had 60 seconds or so to read your CV before they get bored and Chuck it out, because they had so many others to read. So I put all of my relevant experience on that first page, so if they are still interested in you from all your relevant information, qualifications and experience, then they can turn over and get more detailed information. 

I still keep it all in a similar format to what you have, with the usual headings, but just order it differently.

Presentation is also important. Don't have a black font, print it in a medium-dark grey. It's easier on the eyes and looks better. Also adding a highlight colour such as a navy blue, dark red or green to underline the separate sections and underline your name at the top etc. Just make it look nice, and stand out from the others.

Also, I noticed that you, like so many other people just state a quality that you have. In an interview, an employer will probably ask ""So Mr Smith, can you give me an example of when you've been organised?"" Or something to that effect. The point I'm trying to make here is to justify every claim you make in your CV with evidence. Explain how you have that trait, where you learnt it etc.

Just keep being persistent and you'll find one, don't worry! Hard work always pays off!

Hope this all helps!

You could argue the same about Italia 90 and I would probably say that we overpraised the achievements on that occasion, we could and should have done better.

The point is, it's easier for the womens team to reach the semi finals of the womens world cup than it is for the mens to reach the semi finals of theirs. The strength in depth is a lot stronger in the mens game, there are a lot more competitive teams. Think thats bollocks? Well consider that the top 3 from every group in the womens world cup qualified - rather than the top 2 in the mens. Plus a look at some of the scores in Canada this year - 10-0, 10-1, 6-1.

As far as I remember there was only 1 comparable result in last years WC, and it was an extraordinarily exceptional match - Germany 7-1 Brazil.

As for the men's team, I don't know why people expect we should reach the quarters every time, we're no longer in the top 8 teams in the world and haven't been for a while, although the quarters of the euros are by no means beyond us. Despite that, we have reached the quarters in 4 of the last 7 competitions.

She also conceded that veils actually were interpreted as light shawls until very recently in Pakistan. That makes sense to me because the exclusion of women from public life in the Muslim world is a recent phenomenon.

What this suggests to me is that the driving force behind these conservative interpretations is primarily political, not religious. It's reactionary, not spontaneous.

null,false,free2bejc,1986,Gianfranco Zola,null,"No. We were aggressively using Ivanovic to commit an extra player in midfield but not really in the traditional overlapping strategy to gain width. It was more about exploiting speed and space. Where as overlapping is more often about creating space and outnumbering.

In reference to the wingers.
Because to stretch the play we have to be able to get the ball to the wide players by bypassing a congested midfield. Ivanovic allows balls to be played over the top. It's a far quicker route and has contributed a lot to stretching the opposition defence far more than playing tighter football that requires 4-5 passes across the pitch. That is the aerial aspect. He is positioned constantly far higher up the field. Azpi is deeper to cover the defence. Matic and Ivanovic are usually about the same height up the pitch. I might be imagining it but I seem to remember Matic often taking up a further right position and Fabregas nearer Hazard, at least until Willian would definitely be covering. But that's also to do with the positioning for a counter. Hazard is the breaking player, I imagine it's mostly due to the fouling and tactically carding that will occur with Hazard runng.

The last bit of that might require some more thinking time. It's midnight here, I've written about it before but I'll see what I can put together tomorrow. Suffice to say. Azpi and Matic cover terrible pace of CBs and Ivanovic's positioning. Willian can sit but it depends, it's rather difficult to work out specific times when they'd interchange, I have no idea what the triggers were I guess I could do some more reading. Ivanovic is higher to facilitate counters, and spreading the play to combat opposition narrow defences. It enables crosses to be more effective by creating more space in the box and more space between players generally. It's much harder to defend teams that can constantly move from side to side than take a few passes to move it across (unless of course the speed they make those passes at is ridiculous).

Ivanovic higher up also combats Fabregas's lack of physicality as well as allowing the team to perform the higher pressing of the opposition back 4 and goalkeepr by ensuring the numbers in midfield are more or less matched and that high lofted passes to opposition on his side are fairly useless, intercepted and so on.

-

&gt;in Kill the Moon she spends half the movie literally begging the doctor to home back and help her, 

hmm...

&gt; it was even a plot point to set up the mystery because she was confused by wifi set up in her first episode with present day her. So it's a bit weird to be surprised she isn't hacking things in series 8

Also, they never confirmed that they had removed those 'upgrades' in 'the Bells of St. John' so there's no reason she's back to being 'tech dumb'.

I'm all for character development, the Amy and Rory progression was amazing, and engaging, but the Clara regression is, well, a regression... and it's quite off-putting, and quite... bad.

There have been 2 characters in the series who have witnessed the doctor changing, let's recall how each handled the changes:

 * Rose, decided to fight an alien race in the doctors name on behalf of humanity.

 * Clara, cries and whines to a lizard woman (who's an awesome character btw) that she doesn't like the new doctor, and then promptly has a conscious battle over whether to stay as his companion or not...

Both of these cases came after She (Clara/Rose), quite literally, sacrificed their lives to save the doctor. Rose, after, fights Cassandra, forcing her to use her body instead of the doctors, Clara next complains that she was having a date with Mr. Pink when the Doctor took her, but helps save a ship, against the Daleks, ok, getting better... The Robot of Sherwood was a half decent episode. Listen is actually a great episode, and it seems as though we're going more to a strong companion situation again, this is then continued in Time Heist, then we get the Caretaker episode, which is one of the weaker ones in the season, and we get typical loaded trap BS fired at the Doctor as both Clara and Mr. Pink team up on the doctor. Quite frankly if I were the Doctor, I would have told Clara to F*** off and to take Clumsy Pink with her as the two of them nearly doomed the planet in their BS drama. My major problem with this one is that it's another cliched 'bad guy gains upperhand because of good guys incompetence at an opportune moment'. Then we Plummet down to 'Kill the Moon' by far the worst episode of them all, where Clara spends a good 20 minutes whining, and begging the doctor to come save her, and saying 'I can't do it', then scolding him for leaving her, prompting the most childish temper tantrum we haven't seen since Mickey/Rickey decided to whimper at Rose's leg, then we see the end of the previous episode come to terms, where Clara admits what the Doctor did pushed her too far, and she was done. Then we get Mummy on the Orient Express, a great episode, right up until  the end where more drama is forced into the series. Then Flatline, now this was a brilliant episode, we're back to useful Clara, finally, we have some daylight, we've got a good solid climb out, 2 solid episodes in a row after 2 dribble episodes with forced drama, and BS, no more shitty episodes, where Clara is useless... Enter In the Forest of the Night... Ugh, back to forced drama, and tenseness between the love triangle. Then we have the pinnacle of bad writing, the Soldier decides to blindly cross the road, and get shit, mid Drama.... oooooh tension, insert angry, stupid Clara, and 'sometimes you must make the tough choices' Doctor, who promptly makes the bad choice (keeping Clara after she destroyed the TARDIS keys, and betrayed him in every way possible)...  oooooh Drama... ~ish... with no real consequences... Then, after, basically, killing the doctor (albeit in a dream) she decides that she can't 'kill' Danny, to save the world, but she was fine with murdering the Doctors Childhood friend. They finally break it off, but then she comes back in the bonus episode, and again, more artificial drama is forced into the show, and as with everything Danny Pink, it just seems awkward, and clumsy, and is just shoehorned into the show. The best relationship on the show so far was Rory and Amy, and it wasn't 'drama this, whine that, shoehorn sadness here', it was flowing, and almost natural, but Clara and Danny, just feels... clumsy.",null,0,null,1436312684,null,0,false,0,csvllpk,null,t3_3c78u5,null,t1_csvllpk,null,t1_csvjdfi,null,null,null,1437672298,null,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1,null

I'd say that maybe you ARE too qualified for a lot of entry roles, which is a dumb thing to be an issue but there you go. You say you were a manager of 120 people? Well I'd guess they'll be thinking ""hmm, this guy used to run things, and was a cop so used to being in authority... if we stick him in a job where he literally just has to follow orders even if it's a dumb one from his manager Greg (fucking Greg...) then will he start pointing out that Greg is an arsehole? Will he try to take control? Will he start trying to apply the law to things? Maybe I'll hire this guy with two years as a cashier instead, because they are less likely to rock the boat. They might even just wonder why you want entry after being far from entry, and not take the chance. The above almost certainly isn't true for what you're like, but you can see why they'd find it easier to go for the safe option.

Conversely, if you're applying for a supervisory, or manage job, then ""ran a big team, know how to tell knobheads to stop being knobheads, used to taking shit from people and acting professional whilst upholding authority"" is a massive plus.

I think maybe you just want ANYTHING to start with, and so are going for the bottom. You want **A** job, so you can use that to pay you whilst you get a better job. Whilst that's obviously the best thing morally and financially, the employer will probably guess that and doesn't want to train someone just to refill the position when you move on in a few months. I say maybe get your aim up a bit. Go for supervisor as a minimum, manager as the average.

People don't necessarily employ the most capable person for a job, they want a cog who fits the machine. As with many low skill jobs, if you write that you're ambitious go getter with team leadership skills who likes to take the initiative, you may get rejected on that alone. I once got through a psychometric test for a supermarket job by answering the opposite of what I'd write for a regular job, much more humble and less about selling myself as Mr. Fantastic. There's also an element of people wanting someone they can mould, rather than someone who is already confident and might challenge their authority. 

Also being a copper is really intimidating to some people. If I was a small business that was sloppy about things occasionally I would not want an ex-copper around. I've worked for plenty of coke heads and worked plenty of low skilled jobs where half my colleagues were stoners. People are just generally conditioned to be nervous around coppers, you might also be facing the same discrimination legally qualified people do, employers don't want people who will hold them to the rules and potentially cause a problem if they fail to uphold them. 

Also being a police officer is the kind of job that require some degree of mental activity and initiative, it's also pretty exciting  (at least compared to stacking shelves), maybe they think you'll be under stimulated and move on. This is pretty much the overqualified thing.

So we have a bunch of accusations, no evidence or witnesses. Any CCTV? You would expect a balanced and informed article to state that either there was or was not video evidence. Given the patient's mental illness, could she have destroyed the doll herself and then misremembered it? We simply don't know.

For the hospital it's the best option to maintain its own reputation (like many big institutions) to apologise even if this event did not happen. An investigation has been launched - will it enforce the principle of innocent until proven guilty? Might someone get penalised or sacked for something they might not have actually done?

Given the legal claim culture we have (no win no fee etc) I wouldn't be surprised if it was fabricated as a cash grab. These sums are very significant and it costs very little to submit a claim. As you all have demonstrated, the media coverage is treated as fact as the headline makes a definite statement that the nurses did it, when we do not know this.

However if it *was* the nurses, I would totally agree with everyone here that this is a serious incident which should never have happened.

I'm only after a retail/restaurant/hospitality type job as it would be the most basic and relevant job for my degree. When I'm looking at graduate schemes or internships in a few years I want to be able to say either ""I took that job as I wanted to prove I could graft at the front end of the business"" or ""I wanted to work part-time in a front end sales type role to gain insight into that side of business"".


If I work as a cleaner or in a warehouse or some other labour job behind the scenes I'd kind of see it as a waste of spare time/opportunity when I could be doing something that looks better on a CV or application in future?


I always thought I'd be setting my sights too high if I applied for retail manager/supervisor jobs as I imagine they get dozens of applications, many of whom will have recent experience managing in stores etc and perhaps wouldn't take management experience in another sector as having the same weight.


Thinking about it now they, if I sell myself right in a covering letter/CV perhaps one level up would be the right way to go, aiming for supervisor level....the qualities I'm trying to put across are what recruiters are looking for at *that* level I guess.

&gt; Club president Jean-Michel Aulas told media on Friday that Lacazette's wages would be doubled to €4 million-a-year, before the club announced it would be a basic €3.84 million increasing to €4.2 million if Lacazette is included -- as is likely -- in France's Euro 2016 squad.
&gt; 
&gt; ""The figures divulged do not match those at the meeting that took place this week,"" the player's representative, David Venditelli, told Le Progres.
&gt; 
&gt; ""I don't understand because the president announced on Friday morning that the salary was a minimum of €4 million. Do you think what the club is saying and their position on the numbers has been coherent in recent days?""
&gt; 
&gt; Lacazette has reportedly asked for an annual salary of between €5.5 and €6 million to remain at the club, whom he contributed to significantly last term as they finished runners-up to Paris Saint-Germain and returned to the Champions League group stage.

So currently on €2m /year. Offered €4m /year. Wants maybe €6m /year

null,false,bachus2015,null,null,null,"Honestly? I had enough of the increasing red tape (by increasing, I meant on an almost daily/weekly basis), increasing restrictions both on my personal life and the job itself, diminishing perks (public sector pay freezes), unequal rights (police officers the only role that cannot strike/take industrial action) and the increasing ""looking over your shoulder"". I also wanted promotion but even one step up is EXTREMELY competitive. There were something like 200 Sergeant vacancies across London and around 5000 applicants(!) so felt like I was stuck in my job. Always wanted something more academic, and decided that now was the time to pursue it.


The job itself - as in the ""on the streets"" side of it can be exciting as fuck. Yes, the police get a bad rap, and rightfully so sometimes but the experiences I've had and the satisfaction I had of catching bad guys and doing the right thing was great. It really is what you think it will be like - I was chasing after burglars and robbers, driving fast pursuing stolen cars (well, mostly mopeds ridden by chavs). I got to see things that most people won't get to see and go places most people won't get to go. I've dealt with all sorts of people I'd never normally get to meet. I've been involved in major events like the Olympics, Royal Wedding, Thatcher's funeral etc. I had some great perks like getting to watch the Champion's League Final for free (whilst working ofcourse).


The positives outweigh the negatives, but it's not for everyone. You **will** get assaulted. You **will** get abuse. Not just a slap in the face and told to fuck off, I've been threatened with knives, been spat in the face, punched, elbowed, bitten. I've seen some horrible things, had to pick pieces of people off the road, seen families devastated and dead bodies, suicides etc. Some things will never leave my mind. I remember someone throwing a large dog out of a 5th floor window, it fell and hit someone walking past on the pavement outside giving them a fractured skull and obviously killing the dog.


I've seen people impaled, human remains spread over half a mile after being dragged by a bus. But I've also seen the good side. Anyone living in London will be able to relate to it feeling very unfriendly, everyone is always in a rush etc compared to living outside of London. But when things go bad, and people do bad things, all sorts of people come together to help. Countless times I've been called to a robber/burglar detained by members of the public, a real mixture of people just coming out of their daily lives/work to do the right thing and help. I think that instinct just comes out in people when the time is right.



And your question, if I could turn back time and not join at all? **No. Way.** I wouldn't change anything. I have some amazing experiences that I'll never forget and cool stories to tell. It is amazing job satisfaction knowing you really made a difference (usually for the better) in people's lives on a daily basis.

***
**Sterling**
 
Sterling was poor for most of the back end, but no poorer then the rest of the team were, excluding Coutinho. It's been said time and time again that they looked like they'd given up after losing 3-0 at Old Trafford. Thoeretically Sterling shouldn't be marked out of a game, he should be able to use his pace and agility to out outmaneuver less mobile defenders and exploit the space that creates. In reality, defenders kick the shit out of opposition forwards, especially the quick, tricky and small kind like Sterling. That's how they try to combat it. So I think it's inaccurate to say you can mark him out of the game, I think it's more like they bully him out of it. 

He was our 2nd top scorer, beaten only by Stevie who was on penalty duty. He played as a lone striker for most of the time before and after Christmas. He blew a few chances late in the season, but the entire squad was flat by that point, and even though United kept giving us chances to steal 4th, it never seemed likely given the morale of the squad. I think its unfair to say he can't finish. He's shown he can, he's just inconsistent. But, both consistency and finishing come with experience, so the more games he plays the better he will be. Pretty self explanatory. So if Liverpool were to offer him the big money (135k-150k p/w) on a long-term contract, realistically you might be overpaying him now, but underpaying him in 3 years time.

Raheem wants too much money. It's true. For what he has (or hasnt as the case may be) done, he's asking too much. But this is the new version of a footballer. They don't want to wait for their big contract at 27-28, they want it younger and younger. He's probably worth 120k p/w to Liverpool right now. If he moves, City would likely offer him 150-175k p/w to start.

I have no problem for him wanting to challenge for trophies. Every player should want to win. But wanting to move to challenge for trophies is normally something an established 26-30 yr old player would be doing, not a 20 year old. This again links back to the idea of the new version of a footballer. 
***

**Ibe**

Ibe was good at Derby. He didn't set the world on fire or anything, but he was solid and consistent, and was given priceless fist team football by then manager Steve McClaren. We recalled him because the first team needed a boost, not because he was playing so well we simply had to. It was either him or Origi, and Lille weren't very keen on the idea, so Ibe it was.

He was very good at RWB. The derby at Goodison comes to mind. But he was also poor at times, he went quiet for long stretches in games, and the strength and pace you eluded to weren't seen in games when they were sorely desired.

He is strong, his bodysize is both taller and stockier than Raheem's, and I think they are of comparable speeds. I think Ibe's shot power might be stronger than Raheems, but his accuracy and finishing is much poorer, and this is simply due to his youth and inexperience.

I actually think his decision making is quite good, up until he has to shoot. Especially in possession but also in defense, Ibe is never afraid to take his man on, and usually gets the balance right between recycling possession back to the midfield and taking his fullback on.

So Ibe made his debut in Carra's last game, vs QPR in 2012/13. He then spent the first half of the 2013/14 season in and around the first team squad, before leaving in January 2014 to Birmingham City on loan for the rest of the season. He then spent pre-season with the club before moving to Derby County at the start of the 2014/15 season on loan before being recalled in January 2015.

That's around an entire season out on loan, and an entire season spent in and around a Brendan Rodgers first team squad. To say he is still getting use to the premier league is probably accurate, but it's just a small step up from the Championship for a player of his touted potential.

I would blame his age and rawness on his lack of finishing, not his inexperience in the premier league directly. If you are going to compare 2 players for 1 position in the same team, you have to compare the two players as they currently are. So I disagree that Ibe now should be compared to Sterling's 1st season. That's an injustice to both Raheem and Jordon.

I think technically Ibe is very gifted, and I haven't seen what you've seen regarding his passing.

***

**Conclusion**

In essence, 50m quid for Sterling is ludacrous money, that Liverpool should gobble up if City offer it. But Liverpool also sacrifice the investment they've made in Raheem, sometimes to the detriment of other players and the team overall.

Ibe for me is a much rawer talent than Sterling. He doesn't seem to be affected by the pressures of premier league football, and I agree, he seems to glide past players as if he's back playing in the youth teams. That talent needs to be nurtured, but not exposed. I think he's probably not ready to start for us just yet, but I fully expect him to continue to develop and be one of our best players in 2-3 years time.

I think your arguing that selling Sterlng for 50m and then having Ibe as his ready made replacement is a no-brainer, and I'm sure many people agree. However, I think Sterling might be one of those players that clubs regret selling, so I'd love to see him sign a new deal and stay until a European giant comes calling for him.

I'm not its in our best interests to significantly strengthen our rivals for the next 10 seasons while severely weakening our our future, which this deal significantly does. He's not going to flop if he goes to City, and I feel the club will be made to regret selling him if they infact do. There's enough games in a season to have Ibe in cup games and the Europa League developing.

If Sterling is sold by Liverpool to a domestic rival, it confirms supporters fears that Liverpool are not interested in winning the league above all else, but in doing good business at the expense of football performance, rather than financial.

**TL;DR Sterling&gt;Ibe atm. Better finishing and composure due to more experience. Selling Sterling because Ibe might eventually better is not feasible. Should be trying to maximise our football return from our young academy players, not the financial return. If Liverpool sell him to a domestic rival then the club is a long, long way from where the fans want it to be.**",null,0,null,1436316412,null,0,false,0,csvnpl9,null,t3_3chkt0,null,t1_csvnpl9,null,t3_3chkt0,null,null,null,1437673400,null,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5,null

Martinez would have been an excellent signing but for his age, so when fans see a player they rate linked to clubs that aren't riddiculously larger or wealthier than LFC they're curious as to why the club aren't in for him. In this case, the cost was too high for a player of his age, and his wage demands were probably too high as it will be his large big contract. Atletico don't mind bringing in an older striker for a season or two because they have the wage structure and turnover rate to do it. We dont.

Criminals and young offenders are aware of this, so all that will happen is the knife will be carried by the youth of the group. So those that are older will still have access to a weapon but wont be carrying it incase of them being pulled by the police.

My girlfriend is unable to work due to ill health, but the powers that be have decided she's ""fit for work"" and therefore can't get any benefits, which means I have to pay all of our rent and bills as well as providing food and what little money for entertainment I can pull together. I'm posting at 3am because I just got home from my main job, which I started at 2 this afternoon. I'll be starting it again at 2 tomorrow, finishing around the same time as tonight. I then have a ""day off"" which involves working 8-6 at another job, before I go to both jobs on Friday (8-4, then 6pm-4am).

If I have a choice between cooking something or ordering a pizza, I order a pizza, because I'm fucking exhausted. As it is, tonight I'm exhausted and broke, so I'm eating 2 slices of toast for my dinner. The only other meal I ate today was at about 7pm, and that was chicken from Dixy's - because I only get a 30 minute break, they're across the road, and they give me a discount.

I don't have time to cook or really do food shopping, and I don't have the money to buy many nice things (including food that doesn't come in a plastic tray). Once a week I make sure I eat a real meal that I cook at home, but most of the time it's either takeaway, toast, or tuna sandwiches.

I have a first class degree. Unfortunately, finding a ""real"" job that would pay me more money to do less work requires me to not be absolutely fucking exhausted all the time, because job hunting is practically another job in itself.

A cynical viewpoint, maybe, but definitely a valid argument. Where do you stand on the question of whether some interpretations are more valid than others, regardless of the political drives responsible? It's only my opinion, but I am increasingly convinced that these conservative interpretations are neither mandated by the Quran nor in the spirit of the text. 

&gt;  There's no real way to somehow separate the pure essence of a religion from its embodiment in practice, teaching, and adherent behaviour.

I don't think I agree. That might be true if you were looking at religious behaviour at one moment in time - say, the present - as we tend to do when we're confronted with news articles about worrying religious behaviours. I think if you take a more historic view, look at the changes that occurred in Arabian society during the birth of Islam, look at the direction of travel over the ages, then you start to build up a distinction between the spirit of the religion, and different cultural/political practices.

And while his wage demands are higher than he should be asking for, as I already stated.., he will be worth that much per week in 3-4 seasons. He represents the new type of footballer who wants money first, loyalty second.

Besides, if Raheem looks around Liverpool's rivals, and what they pay their best players, and says ""Well hey, I'm one of your best players Liverpool. Pay me like it"" he's not entirely wrong.

He just wants to earn what he thinks he's worth, which in this case is too high.

I think we have to rule out the extremes in the case of the Doctor. Because as pointed out, he would be billions if not trillions and more ahead of Bond due to destroying the universe for example.  
I think to make it a ""fair fight"" the kills should only be counted it the Doctor is seen on screen actually killing a persona directly, eg, putting a gun to their head and firing (not that that's happened - to my knowledge - but that's an example), so things such as The Moment killing practically everyone on Gallifrey isn't something that should count because he didn't individually kill every person directly, he only pressed the button...though I know pulling a gun's trigger is basically the same, but hopefully some of you get what I mean?  
Any kills that count should only be by means that both the Doctor and Bond could accomplish, so shooting someone, sure. Throwing someone off a cliff? Sure. Firing a giant intergalactic lazer beam that destroys super clusters, no. Unplugging the universe and plugging it back in again just to see if it'll work, no.

That's a bit rich. ""We"" didn't turn him into that. He turned himself into that with the help of the club. For the players who wind up in League 2 or the North Korean Premiership or out of football altogether, do ""we"" turn them into that? It's also important to note that he went from 16 to 20 years of age in that span, not an insignificant detail.

&gt; There were plenty of times during his development where we could have given up on him...

Such as? He was a blue chip talent from start to finish. We never considered shipping him out and neither would any other club have done. Maybe we could have sent him on loan to a Championship club, as you mentioned, but I fail to see how that would have ruined him. It didn't ruin Harry Kane. It hasn't ruined Jordon Ibe. Etc.

&gt; we kept giving him chances and pushing him and it paid off.

Playing one of the biggest young talents in England wasn't exactly a bold move especially when you consider that Victor Moses was often the other winger/AM. We had no depth.

To ignore that is a bit silly considering Britain's support of Saudi Arabia. 

You've then used that argument to hoist Corbyn up as 'The Man Who Hates Britain' in true DM fashion. Stop jumping to conclusions and stick to the facts.

I think you're vastly overestimating Corbyn's challenge to the leadership and his view of the world. As enthralling as you may find the RT vs Western Media war, I assure you the vast majority of people don't give a shit about it. 

As for the IRA involvement question, it was my understanding he called them a long time ago and invited them over to talk, something which if done sooner could have saved a lot of lives. If you know anything about Ireland, you'll know both sides has a tremendous amount of blood on their hands.

I'm sorry that the left of the party can't just sit in the corner and keep backing leaders who don't represent them. 

I don't agree with Corbyn on some issues but to me at least he's an alternative to the same old Tory-lite polices of Cooper and Burnham or indeed the Red Tory herself(Who I think would be more at home on the right of the lib dems, but hey they said the same thing about Blair and the SDP).",null,0,null,1436326195,null,0,false,0,csvt6qt,null,t3_3cf5b3,null,t1_csvt6qt,null,t1_csv57fo,null,null,null,1437676916,null,0,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,0,null

He'll look at what players are available and weigh them in terms of cost and how they can impact the current squad.

But I'll tell you what I remember of him. As /u/emre23 mentions, he's left footed, pacy and direct. But there's much more to his game than that. He is creative. He has a bunch of assists in La liga. He is a fairly good dribbler of the ball. 

One thing that stood out for me is his defensive ability. Very good at tracking back, making tackles (could be a bit rash sometimes), winning aerial duels, intercepting the ball. I remember reading somewhere that Ancelotti tried playing him as a left back. I'll link the article if I can find it. That helped his defensive game quite a bit. That's one of the reasons I like him. Very good both offensively and defensively.

Also, sorry about the late response. Was out getting some food.

Valid by what measure? The only measures are the opinions of the adherents and clerics. To anyone from outside of a religion the concept is meaningless. From inside it just means the ability to be persuasively argued. 

&gt;I think if you take a more historic view

Taking a historic view allows you to possibly understand what a religion was and how it changed. It doesn't alter what it *is*.

Your additional question: As I consider religion to be largely a political tool wearing priest's robes then, sure, the extremism within it has a political element.
