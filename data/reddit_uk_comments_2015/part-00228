null,false,TriumphantGeorge,null,null,null,"That's the trick, isn't it? Even pointing out previous abuses of data can't disprove the idea ""this time it'll be different"". And it *is* a bit of a tedious topic really.

The ISP aspect is misleading. It doesn't matter where the data is physically stored; what matters is that it *is* stored and available and can be browsed and linked to other datasets. 

My own concern comes not so much from them storing my own ""data double"" (the full data copy of all my movements and activities) - although its potentially scary that decisions might be made by the state based on data you have no ability to examine. More importantly, it's happening to my representatives (elected MP, union leader,  employer, other state institutions) and that puts them in vulnerable position in terms of being influenced. It puts more power in the hands of unelected groups.

Self-interested parties are always trying to gain leverage which helps them pursue their own interests at the expense of others, and there's always a (Jack Straw-like) politician or policeman or media entity or  similar to help  that process. What's even worse is they do so clumsily with casual collateral damage. 

See the example of [the Economic League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_League_%28United_Kingdom%29#Publicity_and_decline) as a random example in recent history. Which then morphed into [the Consulting Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consulting_Association), and so on. Corporate interests, tracking data, police and government collusion. Even if it doesn't affect you personally, it affects the country you are living in - and data tracking plus a ""moral imperative for economic gain"" makes these things more dangerous.

As David Cameron has said, “For too long, we have been a passively tolerant society, saying to our citizens 'as long as you obey the law, we will leave you alone'. It's often meant we have stood neutral between different values. And that's helped foster a narrative of extremism and grievance.”

Full-cover data retention coupled with an extra-legal attitude like this is a recipe for disaster. So our approach should be: 

* If it cannot be shown to be justified and proportional, it should not happen.

* The *proven*, evidence-based benefits must outweigh the potential downsides and exposure.

* A hand-waving argument based around ""it might be useful"" plus some anonymous leaks is not evidence.

* The default answer to all proposals for the data doubling of innocent citizens should be, ""no"".

null,false,MartynH,null,null,null,"I'm going to give a slightly different point of view here - I'm not saying this is the right thing to do, but only you really know your situation and from reading the other responses here, they feel like they are missing what you're really asking - not if you should, but if you can.  Getting on the properly ladder is difficult and the longer you wait, the higher house prices seem to be getting - so I totally get where you're coming from.

Anyway - I did a very similar thing a while back when I was first trying to get on the properly ladder.  I live down south so property was, and still is, very expensive for what you get.  My father, who is a bit like a wise old wizard, told me this about buying property ""You should always get the most expensive house that you can afford.  It may be tough financially for a while, but it'll be worth it in the long run.""  What I did was to get a loan in principle for the longest term I could, that is to get up to the point of actually signing the paperwork to ensure that you can actually get the loan you need; mine was over 4 or 5 years I think - this means you pay more in the end but the monthly repayments are manageable - anyway, there will be a sweet spot between monthly repayments and period.  See if you can get a loan with no early repayment fees.  Go through the process of buying a house and only when it comes to the point that you are asked to pay the deposit and fees - then take the loan out and not before.  

All the usual caveats apply here - this isn't sound financial advice and I'm not a financial advisor, I don't know your situation or whether you can afford to do this.  It worked for me as I was desperate to get on the property ladder, had a well paid job and was really impatient - what really sold it for me is that I found that paying my mortgage was around the same price as paying rent, even with the loan repayments included. YMMV

The best thing you can do financially is follow everyone else's advice - saving money upfront is probably the better option here, but being overly cautious in life doesn't always pay off.

Isn't your argument the wrong way around? If someone was proposing something, my question would be about what the justification was?

History demonstrates that information and power are abused unless  heavily restricted. So something as sweeping as these proposals needs substantial evidence-based backing, I'd say.

Do you realise that the phrasing for these proposals is deliberately vague? It's not storing your ""web page visits"" that is proposed. It's storing *all internet-connected activity*. This includes all data exchanges between devices and providers, at app-level or network-level. 

Combined with the [recently passed-without-debate ""savings"" legislation](http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/may/15/intelligence-officers-have-immunity-from-hacking-laws-tribunal-told) (actually giving immunity to GCHQ staff, intelligence officers and police to hack into anyone's devices) it paves the way for complete mirroring of all communication in the broadest sense, and unrestricted access to do so in the future.

When we're dealing with something of this scale, the potential for deliberate internal abuse or loss of control to external agencies is obvious, and mission creep is likely a certainty - the weight of justification is purely on the government's side.

&gt;with the high and rising prevalence of zero hour contracts you can't just say ""unemployment is down, we're doing a good job""

Lets look at the data. 

http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/factcheck-truth-jobs-wages/19959

&gt;The percentage of all employees who are doing a temporary job, for various reasons, has risen very slightly under the coalition, from 6 to 6.4 per cent.
The issue of people working on zero-hours contracts is a tricky one. The ONS has published figures suggesting that 2 per cent of people in employment are on a zero-hours contract – or about 622,000 people. But we don’t know whether that is more or less than in 2010.

ZHC a small minority (also data suggests majority satisfaction of people on ZHC) . 

From the horses mouth:

&gt;Last year the chairman of the UK Statistics Authority, Sir Andrew Dilnot, gave Labour a slap on the wrist over a dodgy press release that claimed there had been a “huge increase” in zero hours contracts under David Cameron, when there was no evidence of a rise.


And to finally prove the point:

&gt;The very richest have been hit the most by government policies, and for middle earners the effect is a giveaway that more than cancels out the £1,600-a-year cost-of-living deficit identified by Labour.
For people at the very bottom of the income distribution, the sum effect on income of all the government’s policies appears to be a big fat zero.",null,0,null,1434442441,null,0,false,0,cs863lm,null,t3_39wmdd,null,t1_cs863lm,null,t1_cs7f9pw,null,null,null,1437045395,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

WRT competitive swimming Basically until you get to a super competitive level I have found you do the same type of training whether you are a sprinter or long-distance. You would never get a 5000m runner doing the same as a 100m runner but idiotic coaches with lots of kids will write one set on the board and expect everyone to follow it which will get you fit but will not provide the specialisation necessary at competitive level. 

It's getting better in some ways worse in others. Better that conditioning in the gym is now more important with some focus on differing strokes/distances amongst progressive coaches but the amount of training you are supposed to do even at a young age has increased - when I was 10 I swam 4x a week for 2hrs at a time, I know kids now who do double that.

There is a clear, long established belief that crushing jobseeker's spirits and removing their only source of income is truly the way to encourage them to try harder to find a job, while it should be obvious to even the most casual observer that what's needed is practical and emotional support, encouragement, access to training and the engagement of professional job hunters to match clients to vacancies.

What you get is threats and bullying while being told point blank that they're not there to help you and you have to do it all yourself - while complying with stricter and stricter guidelines.

The case mentioned in the blog post is extreme, but not unbelievably so. I've had a similar experience myself and I was signing on at one of the nicer Jobcentres with staff who mostly sympathised with claimants, but who were trapped into being arseholes by policy, politics and legislation. Every week, there would be some new stipulation placed on me and them. It was obvious that the emphasis was on breaking spirits and keeping claimants on the hop, not knowing what to expect from day to day and forcing them to fall foul of new policies they couldn't possibly know about.

But i think the reason i got into that state was having far too high turnover of players rather than focusing on getting the right players in. Too often players that were bought by the last manager are moved out and not replaced by anyone better. The squad the Rodgers inherited wasn't that bad especially given the young players coming through.

&gt; No but Corbyn is the dream candidate for us tories, I shall be putting my three quid in to vote for hi. I hope many of my brethren do the same.

You have to have very little faith in your own party to actively attempt to sabotage the opposition. At least the Tory members are being honest about their desire for totalitarianism...

Anyway, I think the fact that Labour needs to take itself seriously is exactly why it would have been wrong for Labour MPs to deny Corbyn's bid. Like it or not, Corbyn's side is a side of the party, and there are people who join Labour and vote Labour because they believe Labour should be the party that stands by the people.

Labour can't have a serious discussion if all its candidates are centre or right of centre. I don't think Corbyn will win the leadership bid and I am not entirely sure if he should.  But by being included he has now changed the nature of the leadership debate. All the other candidates are now forced to recognise that there is this side to the party, and it can't just drop all its values (the ones the author cries for in the 6th paragraph) simply to meet populist demands. Andy Burnham in particular will now be more focused on making sure the values he focuses on are supported by those who would otherwise vote Corbyn rather than those who will vote Liz. Whilst populism is a vote-winner, if every party just changed its values to meet what the population currently thinks, then we may as well just have a single-party government.

Labour needs to be the party that drives the public agenda, not merely follows it. This is what the Tories did well in the last election, they didn't just follow the public agenda, they drove it. They convinced people that there way was the only way, and Labour happily accepted that whilst meekly going ""yeah but..."". The reality was that Labour was trying to sell progressive policy whilst accepting the Tory narrative, and people interpreted that as weak... The best strategy has always been to be a party that changes public opinion on various issues until they no longer agree with the opposing parties views.",null,0,null,1434448226,null,0,1434449054,0,cs87e3z,null,t3_39wxcj,null,t1_cs87e3z,null,t3_39wxcj,null,null,null,1437046395,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

The article you link is about ensuring Christians keep freedom of conscience in a society which is increasingly intolerant and rigid in the face of religious belief. People should be under no compulsion to abandon their views on traditional marriage and the role it plays in family life.

I would argue strongly against that, I see no justification for somebody conducting marriages to be able to decide how easy it is for somebody to have access to civil rights.

If you were to frame it as a race issue - you may see my point, look at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-miscegenation_laws

If I a racist minister in a small town refused to marry a white man to a black woman because it was against my religious values.. you'd be fine with that... seriously?

What about a shop owner... Are you okay with shop owners refusing people's custom because they're gay and that's against their religious values? This logic reduces to absurdity very quickly.

&gt; Also, ""all I want him and his party to do is understand and show sympathy to the LGBT community."" Surely the main article of this thread is evidence that UKIP are trying to do exactly that?

I agree, it's good... I'd rather they were included.. I don't think it's prejudiced from the organisation staff to disallow them, it's the only thing they could have done to ensure safety of those involved.

The reson can either be fuel resisue building up in your system and clotting up and blocking the jet, which can supposedly helped with a fuel additive called profi fuel max in some caes, as it dissolves fuel residue and cleans your fuel system.

While it might be phrased as the freedom for religious views to be expressed, this isn't at all what he's talking about in that article. We *already* have the right to express bigoted views, provided you don't do anything about them and you don't incite violence etc. So talking about ""giving protection"" to antiLGBT* people would entail something more than permitting them to speak their views.

The key example given was talking about the baker refusing the serve a gay couple. If UKIP / Farage want to ""protect"" that person, that would entail allowing them to deny service on the basis of sexuality. That is effectively legalising a form of *actual* discrimination, and clearly *is* an example of antiLGBT* policies and views held at the very top level of UKIP.

And whether it would hold up in court is entirely irrelevant here - no-one is trying to take legal action against Farage for those ""jokes"", they're trying to hold him accountable in the press, which is a very appropriate response to a politician being offensive I feel.

Secondly, even if we accept that Maloney acted poorly, and that she shouldn't have made those comments after letting the ""jokes"" slide, that doesn't actually affect how we should feel about Farage making those comments at all. He made ""jokes"" which are at best in poor taste and at worst actually bigoted. Whatever you're view on the jokes, they are absolutely inappropriate for a politician to make, let alone a party leader. That those comments were made at all shows that there's a culture within UKIP that is accepting of that sort of offensive behaviour, again, right to the very top of the party.

&gt; Also, ""all I want him and his party to do is understand and show sympathy to the LGBT community."" Surely the main article of this thread is evidence that UKIP are trying to do exactly that?

I'd argue that it's actually evidence that Farage is trying to defend his party (as a party leader should), rather than any overarching policy shift within the party. Farage's comments are all regarding his outrage at UKIP's exclusion, but don't really address any concerns that LGBT* people have with UKIP's policies and inclusiveness. While you might say that the fact UKIP members wanted to march at a Pride parade at all is a sign of that shift, I'd say that's more likely to be *elements* of the party, and until it's seen at the top level that the actual *policies* of the party change, then I'm not going to consider that an indication that UKIP is becoming less antiLGBT*.

&gt; If gay people really want to start a witch hunt against OAPs because they find homosexuality weird, then you can enjoy the media ripping you apart for expecting them to join you as you hold people to another generation's morality. You could, of course, let sleeping dogs lie and wait for them to die. Are you really going to get mad at old people?

Yes, it should still be unacceptable for people to hold bigoted views if they are old, because it's always unacceptable. Even Farage acknowledged that it would be unacceptable to be a *racist* old person, so why would it be acceptable to be homophobic? That distinction is a very telling one, that again shows that UKIP at the top of the party is accepting of homophobia in a way which is not acceptable in this country. They understand that racism is universally wrong (or at least they claim to), but for some reason homophobia isn't considered the same kind of bigotry. If the party leader is willing to on national television defend a person's right to be homophobic, then it's hard to see how that party could be anything other than antiLGBT*.",null,0,null,1434450640,null,0,false,0,cs87xva,null,t3_3a04qr,null,t1_cs87xva,null,t1_cs87icy,null,null,null,1437046863,null,2,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,2,null

null,false,gamas,null,null,null,"&gt; Corbyn is a less effective public speaker

What makes you say that. On the Sky News interview he actually did well, he spoke eloquently and with politeness - and the host honestly couldn't find any angle to attack his view. Whilst I agree it would be too much of an uphill battle for him to win an election, I think he has something Ed didn't have, which is charisma. He seems to me to be someone who could go into media interviews and come out looking unscathed and looking the better man. Like I genuinely think he could even stump Kay Burley in ways to attack him.

Populist agenda doesn't matter if you can convince people to follow your agenda instead. And you do that by making your view sound more reasonable and respectable than any other view. From everything I've seen so far, Corbyn argues his case so well that it's actually fairly difficult to disarm him, even when his view is seen as wrong.

EDIT TL;DR: There is a number of negative things you can say about Corbyn (which are mainly his views on some issues), but that he has a lack of charisma or public speaking ability is absolutely not amongst them. I mean the guy is able to speak flawlessly without blundering or raising controversy without needing all the PR coaching that Ed and Cameron needed.

EDIT2: Plus, although I think Andy will ultimately be the next leader, I am at least slightly curious about the what if of Corbyn being leader. The dynamic during PMQs would certainly be very different. Corbyn being polite and respectful at all times, whilst Cameron desperately trying to win the argument by shouting derogatory remarks at the Labour party as he usually does. I think Cameron would really struggle to successfully attack Corbyn as Corbyn's polite respectfulness would overwhelm Cameron.

Yes. Ofcourse using marijuana is not great for your health. Drinking alcohol at a young age is not good for you either.


The thing is it doesn't matter if it's illegal or legal. People will still smoke it. Some people even say that if it's illegal that encourages more adolescents to try it.

My son-in-law went through a similar situation to that in the article:

He was doing a part-time college course (less than 16 hours a week, BTEC level 3).  One of the college advisor's told him to sign on for JSA as his girlfriend/my daughter had just fallen pregnant and money was tight.  He took all his college paperwork with him when he signed on and was told he was fully eligible for JSA providing he was looking for work whilst not at college.   

His original JSA advisor was perfectly happy with his course and the amount of job searches he was doing. A few months later his advisor changed and she went out of her way to make his life difficult. She's 'forget' to click whatever button needed to be clicked to say he'd attended his sign-on. His JSA was stopped with no warning as all of a sudden his course was at too high a level (it wasn't).  CAB got involved and had that decision overturned.  A couple of months later he was told he'd have to do a work placement - which just happened to be on the exact same days that he was at college.  His tutors at college arranged for him to be continue via personal meetings and distance learning.  He was sanctioned for a month for failing to attend the JC despite calling them 24 hours before to re-arrange as my daughter had just gone into a labour.  That was overturned again with the help of the CAB.  Her favourite tactic was to randomly change the time and dates of his sign-ons.  He'd get a call at 9am telling him his appointment was at 9:15am that day or he'd turn up for a sign-on to be told that it had been moved back four hours.  It only stopped when the CAB contacted her manager's manager and he was shifted to a different advisor.

It was all totally petty bullshit from a single advisor who seemed to have a bee in her bonnet about someone actually wanting to better themselves by going to college rather than settling for working at one of the local fish processors.

That said. I agree with the premise that religion in schools should really remain in the religious studies classroom. However I went to a Cathedral school and was a Cathedral chorister. I wouldn't swap the experiences I had and the music and culture for anything in the world. Neither would many of my school friends. The majority of which were then, and are now, atheists.

yes, economics is very complicated.  That's why it often makes sense to look at big picture to see how the many variables are effecting the real world.

The main problem is people that are well off have little empathy for others, even when it is proven to better at a macro-economic level.  Not all or even most are ignorant or masochistic, just to focused on themselves.

null,false,rjolly,lfc68,,null,"Disagree. For two reasons.

Firstly this isn't a first. This isn't the first time Fsg have failed to invest. What about last January. We were looking like we could get top 4 and maybe could compete for the league. It was obvious that we were weaker than Chelsea and City. It was obvious we had a thin squad. It was obvious we needed investment yet FSG did not provide the funds to sign someone. We pissed around with Salah meaning that we couldn't agree on financial terms and dragged it out for over a week when it should have been snapped up quickly. Chelsea come along and within 2 days have him signed. We should have had him signed a week before that. And no one knows what happened with Konoplyanka that may have been Dnipros fault.
The point is that Liverpool should have strengthend, they didn't want to spend money and missed out on a signing. We saw how thin the squad was when Surridge was injured and Hendo suspended that season. Signing Salah although not a great player may have won us the league. Yet we didn't strengthen. And a similar thing happened before where we couldn't sign Dempsey because Fulham  wanted an extra 1-2 mil. That transfer window was disgraceful and it wasn't Rodgers fault that we was left with only 2 strikers for half a season, one of which Borini got a long term injury.

Secondly, It makes sense that FSG may be reluctant to give Rodgers money as he didnt spend well in the summer. But by keeping him as manager they are showing their trust in him and must fully back him. If they are worried he won't spend money well then sack him? Harsh but that and the fact that the previous season was underwhelming is more than enough reason to take action. By keeping him as manager they must continue to back him and also stop signing players who Rodgers doesn't want such as Balo and Aspas and Assaidi. Let Rodgers make the signings and if they're still poor signings then let him be at fault and then take action if necessarily.

I don't think FSG and John Henry have ill intentions, and this is just a rumour which could be bullshit. But if they are serious about Liverpool they need to ensure they don't make this stupid mistakes. Not just financially, they should show up at Anfield more often. Not showing up to Gerrards final game at Anfield is inexcusible. Of course there in it to make money but there is no better way to make money than to be successful, having to sell to buy is very risky.

I still don't understand how people offered such an opportunity, effectively receiving an extraordinary gift, could not feel some kind of obligation or even just an affinity to said country afterwards.

I really find it hard not to judge someone for taking that opportunity with both hands, and then immediately leaving afterwards. I think it's shameful, I really do.

I have a sibling in tens of thousands of pounds of debt from university. I'd love to go to university, but £30k worth of debt is extremely discouraging for someone like me.

A country's first thought should be to look after the future of its own citizens, I just can't reconcile that with foreign nationals being given free educations while many talented young working class in this country have to take the burden of tens of thousands of pounds in debt for the same privilege of higher education, or are even deterred altogether due to the great costs involved.

I think it's extraordinarily unjust for someone who's been granted such an opportunity to then immediately pack up and leave the country that's enabled them to be set for life.

Particularly given the inequality there is in the UK right now.

I just can't help but be angered by how unfair this is.

Anyway, I hope you're a success at university mate, I really do. And I hope you have a change of heart and decide to stay afterwards.  We need more bright minds working for the greater good in this country.

higher tax free allowance - yes, this is great but at the same time taking away benefits made this a net loss for the working poor don't forget.  Just to confirm I agree with a higher tax free allowance but there also needs to be living wage.  We need to stop subsidizing businesses so people can have food/shelter.

GDP growth - would have been much higher if we had not had such austerity.  This is basic economics.

better unemployment figures - again, a great thing on it's own.  But a living wage is needed

He may not improve, like Borini didn't, but that remains to be seen. It wasn't long ago (January) that the sub was screaming for a new GK cause Migs form was rubbish.

I was 18 and just came out of a temp job and couldn't find anything else.  I had been signing on for 6 months and had to do the usually check in every 2 weeks.  I saw a different person every time and they were all lovely people.  They checked my log and then got some vacancies up on their screen.  If I liked the vacancy, their system allowed for them to send my CV there and then.  After the 6 months I was assigned an 'advisor', I forget the name of the actual role.  She was the most sweetest lady!  Anyway... There was a government initiative called the Future Jobs Fund (FJF), designed to put young people in my situation in to work.  she looked at me, looked at my details on file and put me forward for it there and then.  2 weeks later I started a 25hr a week job with a local charity and everything has just snowballed from there.  I'm still in touch with other who were on the FJF programme and they are also doing well for themselves.

Anyway, that's just my experience.  It was a long time ago and under a BETTER government.  I has helped, I was never looked down on, and I didn't dread going there.  The FJF programme was cut as soon as the government changed.  Initiative like this, with a HELPFUL job centre save money in the long run.  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Jobs_Fund)

I am aware that the situation is improving since the height of the recession, but for those people (young and old) still out of work that is of little comfort. I'm speaking from my own experience in addition to the experiences of friends and family:

1. My other half is educated to masters degree level and has several years of voluntary experience and can't get an entry level position, but she poses too much of a risk to hire for employers in low skilled jobs. 
2. A friend of mine working in Oxfam and been out of work for 3 years despite holding a 2:1 bachelor's degree. The only offers he has had are for unpaid (See: illegal) internships which he can't afford to do.
3. Two more friends with Bachelor's degrees working in call centres full time (Decent job &amp; pay, but they are still relatively overqualified). 
4. Then a family member recently demoted from his position (Or face redundancy) and reduced from full time to a 5 hour contract meaning at the start of each month he doesn't know whether he will work enough hours to pay the rent. 
5. My Dad who has worked in the oil and gas industry for 35 years, is now facing the risk of redundancy and if it happens, he will have to take any job he can get to pay his mortgage. 
6. I myself managed to find a decent entry level role after graduating, but it took a year, 300+ applications and 19 interviews. It should not be that difficult to find work, not for anyone. Automatic email rejections, companies I visited in person saying they will 'put my CV on file' and never getting back to me etc. 

Despite being in a good position myself, I cannot ignore the situations of those I care about.

Also they are no longer waterproof. On a recent trip to Scotland I had to stop in Oban to buy some waterproof socks as the boots were both leaking very badly. I thought initially it was my waterproof trousers riding up over the boot tops, but my feet got wet on subsequent trips too so I think the liner must have gone in both of them.

I spent all remaining time carrying out further background research on the industry and refreshing myself with the relevant things I studied at university, so I could hit the ground running and cement my chances of getting through the initial probationary period (i.e. not end up back in the dole queue). Spending any time searching for temporary work during this time would have reduced my chances of staying in employment at the new job.

So if they all travelled on the bridge on average once a day and paid £5, it would take a mere 600 years to get your money back, and thats assuming a great deal of travel and zero maintenance costs and building a bridge out there is going to be difficult as there's no proper access so the costs would be much higher than I calculated. Chances are half the people on the island wouldn't want it anyway because it would spoil their view and it wouldn't even connect them to the mainland.

There is a noticeable difference in attitudes here on Reddit towards the vulnerable 15-16 year old children who were groomed for prostitution by Muslim gangs in Rotherham, and the vulnerable 15-16 year old children who are groomed for martyrdom in Syria by Muslim gangs.

Apparently kids are perfectly able to consent to becoming some shithead warlord's wife.

I think it's a little bit a) most (though not all - a fact usually overlooked) of the Rotherham victims were white whereas the jihadi bride girls are not and a little bit b) people don't really understand what ""grooming"" is. I mean they literally don't understand that it involves *making the underage teenagers think they want to do this*. It *looks* like they're consenting. That's the whole point. And that's the *main* reason Rotherham went on as long as it did - not ""PC gone mad"" (which was a secondary factor for some officials involved, but not a major cause) - the authorities just saw a bunch of druggie prostitutes.

Oh what you mean when you said this:
&gt;Ahhh, it's funny because you're confusing UKIP with literally every political party.

Which you then linked to? When that's precisely what I've been stating as the entire problem?

&gt;As to the point about the main parties, did any of them actually open our borders to all comers? Of course not.

New Labour was accused of doing precisely that during the Blair years. Multiple times. In fact UKIP has regularly made the point that by signing us up to the EU, with its' freedom of movement for all EU citizens as a guaranteed right, that that's...basically exactly what has happened and what has been happening ever since Blair jizzed his pants over the EU project.

&gt;As such, their actions show they also want controls on who comes in, since they enforced such controls.
  
Which is why I'm sure it took Teresa May something like four months to totally fail to deport Abu Hamza after all legal appeals had been exhausted and he was legally helpless before her crushing Dominatrix heel or something. The Home Office regularly drags its' feet over matters of immigration, to the point where Call Me Dave was meant to have thrown a posh boy wobbly at his Cabinet after the last election because he told them to actually do some fucking work when it came to the subject of immigration. 
  
I honestly don't understand precisely what point you're trying to make. You haven't at all answered for my point and just keep accusing me of misinterpreting your one-sentence post that literally states nothing except that UKIP are somehow the opposite of a party that want to lower EU immigration and all other parties are the opposite of the parties that have shown either willingness to embrace large scale immigration or willingness to be complacent as fuck about it.
  
Which would mean either that we have had three Prime Ministers who were totally set on ending EU freedom of movement laws and then totally forgot about it for a total of about eighteen years combined.

Or that you're full of shit and you've realised your position is untenable and are deciding to state that you're somehow being misunderstood.

Divock Origi’s season in France was not an unqualified success. Photograph: Etienne Laurent/EPA

Divock Origi had to stay on loan with Lille as a condition of his £9.8m transfer last summer but did not have a season to support Brendan Rodgers’ claim that he is potentially world-class. Origi scored eight times in 33 appearances for a struggling team and was named in L’Equipe’s worst team of the Ligue 1 season. Another forward, Iago Aspas, did not get the regular football he wanted with the Europa League winners, Sevilla, but has confirmed he expects the loan deal to be made permanent this summer for a fee of around £5m. The former Barcelona midfielder Luis Alberto likewise struggled to secure a place in Málaga’s first team. Liverpool’s £6.8m signing does not feature in their manager’s plans.

The powerful defender Andre Wisdom made a promising start at West Bromwich Albion under Alan Irvine but barely got a look in once Tony Pulis took over and made only two substitute appearances after 31 January. He will have a chance to press his first-team claims at Liverpool next season, however, having recently signed a new four-year contract.

Tiago Ilori has rarely been seen at Liverpool since his £7m arrival from Sporting Lisbon, spending one season on loan at Granada and last term with Bordeaux, where his form and game-time improved after an injury-hit start. He has been linked with a permanent exit this summer but Rodgers’ continued problems in central defence may offer a belated opportunity to make an impression at Anfield. The Portugal Under-21 international João Carlos Teixeira is among the young Liverpool players Rodgers plans to utilise next season after scoring six goals in 35 appearances for Brighton &amp; Hove Albion. However, he suffered a major setback in April when he broke his leg against Huddersfield Town and, with his Anfield contract expiring in 2016, time is against him as he looks to impress after recovery.

Dick Advocaat’s arrival at Sunderland transformedSebastián Coates’ loan spell at the Stadium of Light as he went from fringe player to a solid performer in the club’s successful fight against relegation.

But on the other hand, if you can arb then it makes it unnecessary to identify which side of the odds is wrong, and you eliminate the risk that your model is wrong.

There shouldn't be too much real risk if done properly. If you have a £5m bankroll then you can afford to lose £10k without batting an eyelid. Whereas if your bankroll is say £50k, then that would be pretty catastrophic. So if your worst-case scenario is that you let a £50k bet ride and cannot lay it off, then with a sufficiently big bankroll then that's not really a big deal (I would think the biggest risks come when there are long odds on either side as if you fuck up one side of the betting AND the long shot comes off, then you are out a disproportionate sum.

Any religion that can foster an environment where people think its ok to murder their sister/daughter for 'dishonouring the family' should be deplored. Any religion that can create an environment where kids think that anyone who insults a person whose historical existance is disputed should be beheaded, should be challenged at every turn. And any religion that does the above (any many more) and *dares* to say that we should respect their views despite being utterly incongruent with our own, shouldn't be surprised that they are receiving criticism.

&gt;&gt; Would it be OK to be a racist at 70?”

&gt;&gt; ""Er, no""

Completely different. Those who are old today are effectively baby boomers. They lived through social revolutions regarding racial equality and they should know better than to be racist. I think it's fair to hold them to a high standard based on the education they've received though the social discourse throughout their lives.

No such education has been received on homosexuality. Gays have been a big news story for 10 years. The Civil Partnerships Act - when even New Labour, the ""Progressive Party"" capitulated on gay marriage and settled for civil partnerships - was in **2004**. Not 1994. 2004. 10 years ago attitudes to gays were only starting to get pace. That's not a long time. Before that they were still very hushed and didn't make much noise in the social spotlight.

So to round on the elderly and use false dichotomies that compare racial sensitivity to sexual orientation sensitivity, when the social discourse has been imbalanced on the two throughout their lives, is cynical. The comparison simply isn't the same. There hasn't been the same level of attention or volume of information to even begin to think that the amount of changed minds should be the same. We're talking about people born in the 50s, for god's sake.

No.  It might be suspended for 9 months, but in my experience it comes back every year:

&gt; The pollen season separates into three main sections:

&gt; Tree pollen - late March to mid-May.  
&gt; Grass pollen - mid-May to July.  
&gt; Weed pollen - end of June to September.  

I find that the worst part of the year is during Wimbledon fortnight (which starts next week).  After that it tends to trail off slowly until mid-August.  During this time I stay indoors as much as possible and act like a hermit.

Also - avoid trains with windows (Air con only) and tubes if you can.  Wear sunglasses as much as possible and carry lots of tissues.  Anti-histamines work to a certain degree, but you should change which one you use each year as your body gets used to them and the doses in over the counter stuff is small.

On a side note, I'd like to apologise to the poor girls who was crying on a late night tube home a few years ago.

Look at [the military metaphors used](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament_military_metaphors) and try to tell me that it is speaking literally. In Ephesians 6 it is speaking of armour metaphorically, and it even says that we do not fight against ""flesh and blood"", meaning that we do not fight human beings but against Satan and his power. Do you understand what the hymns mean now?

Ephesians 6:11-17  Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.  (12)  For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.

Marin hasn't done shit for Anderlecht in the time he was there. Not that I care, my team won the league, partially due to the big clubs not really showing up in the end.

I wore a silly gown, sat in a hall with a few hundred people who took turns filing onto a stage and shaking hands with some person's whose name I can't recall. If that a ceremony is important to you then fine, but I don't personally think it's anything too special. I wouldn't regret not going to my graduation if I had a job interview I really wanted to attend. 

Other posters are right to say that the company refusing to budge on the interview date is a  big red flag- Any reasonable minded person would be flexible with the date if it's a candidates graduation. 

My advice though would be to do the interview anyway since you really want this job. Make sure they know you're missing your graduation for this interview (be tactful about how you tell them that fact, don't sound resentful) and weigh them up carefully. The interview will give you a good chance to see what they're like to work for, hopefully have a look at around the office and get an idea of the character and personalities of the people who work there. 

Think of some good questions to ask in the interview to help you decide if the company is right for you. I would be personally sceptical given the aforementioned red flag here, but don't let that show. Ask them what their staff turnover is like, and what previous people in this role are doing now. If they're not sticking around and the staff turnover is high without an adequate reason then I would be very inclined to not accepting a job offer from them. 

Even if they don't offer you the job and you've missed your graduation- Don't be downhearted- you've had some good interview practise (and believe me, you get better at interviews with practise) and depending on the location of the interview you may be able to join your friends on evening after-parties ",null,0,null,1434460733,null,0,false,0,cs8b8ju,null,t3_3a0z4k,null,t1_cs8b8ju,null,t3_3a0z4k,null,null,null,1437550880,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

These are such bullshit excuses, having three people die, and ten others almost die, in a **TRAINING** environment is negligence by all superiors involved. Firstly the soldiers didn't have enough water on the hottest day of the year. Secondly it was proposed that the march should be postponed, but it was decided not to because of 'too much paperwork'. Finally it took 2 hours for one of the soldiers to be found after collapsing, despite having a GPS tracker on him.

These men died completely unnecessarily, in a supervised environment. To just dismiss it as *'it's what they signed up for'* or *'that's what SF do'* is very ignorant and quite frankly disrespectful to those who died.

Graffiti? Really, I grew up in a place with no council estates nearby, and there was plenty of graffiti - this is just confirmation bias - I've also lived on council estates with no graffiti. 

The broken window theory may apply to a snowballing effect on crime, but I don't accept the argument that subjectively ugly council housing would precipitate poor treatment of it.

I am saying that 'Onward Christian soldiers, marching as to war' is speaking of Christians being soldiers of Christ fighting Satan and not human beings, and that 'Marching to Zion' is not about fighting for the nation of Israel that was formed around 300 years after the hymn was written, plus it isn't even talking about an earthly Israel but the New Jerusalem.

As for the walls, God chose this method to test the obedience and faith of his people. The test was to whether they would follow the precept given which to human policy seemed foolish, and believe a promise, which seemed impossible. It was by faith, not by force, the walls of Jericho fell down. 

I admit that this question is difficult, and that I don't fully understand the will of God who knows all and knows best. But God is the giver and taker of life. You may not like it but he is sovereign, just and righteous which means that he has the right to will what he wants. He is the potter and humans are his clay. I think that there must had been worse consequences if the Canaanites were not destroyed, but I do not have the mind of God. The Canaanites were extremely wicked. They sacrificed their children to false gods in burnt offerings. 

To summarise, the story of Joshua is literal, the hymns and NT verses are still clearly metaphoric, and your suggestions that they are pro-war and propaganda for Israel are ridiculous.

First of all, he admits that he could do better...which is HUGE for the development of a player and I am glad that he is man enough to admit it and seems ready to improve


Secondly, he didn't do THAT badly.  In fact,  I would call him one of our best players of the season.  He leads our team in assists by quite a margin.  He shows great promise and hes SO young.  This is not the same situation as Soldado.  He is doing well AND he is young.  Soldado is neither so please dont compare the two situations.


Lamela's weaknesses come from playing too easy with the ball and losing it as a result.  Not a terrible weakness to have as it is very fixable.  His skill is there.  His effort is there.  His distribution can be fantastic and usually is fantastic. I really do love this player and have high hopes for him next season.  He showed so much improvement from one season to the next.

At each stage of the educational ""pipeline"", if people are selected not on their own merits but rather the reputation of the institution, then you are selecting not on the person as they are today but how they were when they had access to that institution.  You are picking people because they were good enough to get to Oxford, not that Oxford made them good.  If you send a bus to Imperial College to collect CVs, but can't be arsed to go to Manchester, then you'll get disproportionately more Imperial recruits than Manchester; maybe it is a better institution, but are all 2:1 graduates from Imperial better than all 2:1 graduates from Manchester?  Of course not.

It's not the fault of an individual employer for the full socio-economic separation of society, but it's certainly a bad thing that it happens.  The graduate milk-round is just a small part, but the sum of all of the parts represent a significant privilege to the offspring of those who know how to play the game; who happen, in the most part, to be products of the system themselves.

&gt; Is it unfair for an employer to filter candidates based on their degree?

Yes and no.  It's not unfair to filter candidates based on their suitability, which includes ability, experience and educational background, not at all.

But it is unfair when there's systematic bias.

When the consulting firms choose which universities they're going to pick from that year, and how many they're hiring from each; they're not hiring talented individuals, they're buying 100 members of a stereotype.  They do it because they can afford to hire more than they strictly need (that's the benefit when selling your own people to unsuspecting clients is your chief source of revenue), and have career models that dump 40 to 60% of all new hires within three years anyway.

Downloaded? He's not an MP3 mate ;)

I see where you're coming from, but I don't agree. He's still very young, and I don't see why he wouldn't be happy to work with the EDS if he got the move to a big club - provided he was granted an opportunity to play at senior level if he made the grade.

He's already playing for the Fulham reserves in the Championship.

A move to a top Premier League side, and playing in their reserves (which is what the EDS is) is still a forward step.

I agree though, that he'd probably be suited to a move to another Premier League club lower down the pecking order with less competition for places, and more chance of immediate senior football.

But maybe he's happy to be on our books and go on loan?

If you pick a school with an outspoken religious agenda then that will be reflected in the education you receive. My headmaster about 10 years ago gave an assembly about all the hymn singing crap and how, despite it technically (at that point in time at least) being a legal requirement, he and his headmaster contemporaries chose to ignore it in favour of, you know, education.

Just because a school is nominally 'religious' does not mean that your child will be forced to become religious themselves. A school's status as religious is more generally indicative of its history than its practices.

Obviously parents should do their own research as to the school they send their kids to, and everyone else should remember that a person's religion is a choice that they should be free to make themselves, and that common sense dictates that a 'compulsory worship' program in schools is dangerous and devalues children's natural inquisition.

The issue is further complicated by 'faith schools' which have a poor track record both in terms of pastoral care and in standards of education. It is clear that, if religion is to have a role in education, it MUST not be a defining one

Gee, that means 30% of them went to state schools. No-where does the article discuss quality of different universities being a source of the bias, nor does it explain how 30% of state school kids managed to find their way into these jobs. No-where does it actually compare the candidate pools either.

Instead it goes on about ""soft skills"" being used to filter candidates out, and implies that this is because they're trying to choose private schooled kids. It could be because those soft skills are defining criteria, and privately schooled kids happen to have them more often. They don't bother asking whether these skills are needed (a lot of them will be), and why state school kids don't cut it.

Sports are lovely but not everyone can take part in them on a regular basis. On top of that, not everyone can afford the gym.

The trick to having an active society is getting people to be active in their everyday lives going about their business rather than making time out of their days to ""get active"". How do we do this? Well make it easier to walk or cycle.

Now for cycling we don't need to encourage ""lyra and strava"" style cycling, nor do we push the ""reflective jackets and helmets"". We develop cycle infrastructure and encourage casual cycling where people dress normally, cycle at their own pace and use cycling as a form of transport. That's where we're going wrong in this country, we see cycles as exercise equipment and something super fit people do. It's not hard to do, it's not ultra tiring and you don't need to be dressed like a gimp to do it.

As for walking I think we can encourage that by improving public transport, pedestrianising major shopping districts and giving streets back to people. Making cities and districts walkable is a big step in encouraging fitness.

In short, the key to a fitter society isn't sports, it's being active as part of your routine.

Finally, insurance. I have no idea how much this will affect your policy, but Abus (or similar) with a high ""Sold Secure"" rating can mean cheaper insurance. Cheap shit locks won't help your insurance at all.

I am not sure that is the problem. Most of our green fields are just that, fields. In the middle of nowhere, and no different to a million other fields. Nobody cares if (some) of them get built on, nobody wants to go there for a day out. Provided they don't destroy the nicest parts of the countryside, we don't really mind.

The real problem is infrastructure. It costs a fortune to build houses on green field sites. It is much cheaper to tack them onto the outskirts of existing towns, and add further strain to existing infrastructure which is already barely holding out.

There is a field next to our estate which will probably have 1000 houses on it quite soon.

Caffeine is a akin to a low level amphetimine, its a upper.

Heres a basic explanation;

http://science.howstuffworks.com/caffeine1.htm

&gt;It is a drug, and actually shares a number of traits with more notorious drugs such as amphetamines, cocaine and heroin.

I think its interesting the fact you separate caffeine from a 'real drug' shows a lot about how misinformed a lot of the general public are in regards to legal vs illegal drugs. For example weed is neither physically nor mentally addictive outside of mentally created habitual pleasure addictions, but they can be generated with any activity (porn, gambling, sex whatever) wheras most legal and socially accepted drugs are actually both kinds of addictive.

Caffeine, nicotine and alcohol will all kill you if you abuse them enough, weed wont.

The internet
Big data
Mobile phones
Computing
Robotics
Accessible air travel
The destruction of the community
The birth (and arguably death) of the welfare state

The world is changing faster now than ever.

If you were born 150,000 years ago and jumped forward 100 years or even 1000 you'd find nothing particularly alien.

If you were born 2000 years ago and jumped forward 100 years you'd cope well enough, 1,000 would probably be pushing it though.

If you were born 200 years ago a jump of 100 years would be pretty fantasitc, but 10 or 20 nothing much.

Think about now, look back over 20 years and how much has changed, events like september 11th hadnt happened or Edward Snowden or Obama. Imagine jumping forward 20.

Nothing stays the same, the only constant is change.

You're attempting to move this discussion from the arguments stated in this post to my purported heritage.

Besides, immigration policy in the past is of no relevance to immigration policy today. 

You've also scanned my posting history and have incorrectly concluded that I want no immigration to the UK. Perhaps if you look more carefully, you'll find that I'm supportive of skilled immigration

&gt;No other country in the world is so incredibly short sighted 

You'll find that immigration policy is FAR more restrictive in other countries. But you appear to have the impression that the UK is the apex of xenophobic hatred.

Another personal attack that's of no relevance to the argument. I'm not sure where I've stated I worship Enoch Powell. Perhaps you could tell me. 

Your response is emotional. You're attempting to counter perfectly valid arguments by attacking the speaker, not the argument.

Players develop at different rates, this lad is just 18.

He plays for England's Under 18s. Very few lads at that level are regular starters at a Championship or Premier League club.

If we sign him we'll be buying potential. Of course he doesn't have the quality to walk into our side at present, but if you're expecting him to do that then you're looking at this transfer entirely the wrong way.

&gt;I merely stated that as an effort to just make it look like txiki and ferran have their shit together and arent slacking on the transfers this is silly, and we shouldn't have bothered.

You really think that, really? I think that's an utterly absurd suggestion frankly, mate.

&gt; I don't see him bringing anything to the team

Again, that's because you're looking at his signing the wrong way. We're buying him in the hope that he'll eventually make the grade and have an impact.

&gt;and think the DoF just wanted it to seem like he wasn't slacking off in the market after the rags sign depay, chelsea sign falcao liverpool ings and milner etc.

Once more; the idea that we'd just burn £5m, throwing it away on a useless player with no real potential in order to look active in the transfer market is beyond absurd. It's moronic.

&gt;and i dont really think that was necessary if they actually just buckled down and made sure we do our best for top targets.

Have you evidence to suggest we aren't?

You're jumping the gun here mate. Flapping, IMO.

We are active in the transfer market, we're working on deals for several high profile players at present, without question.

Stop fretting about what rivals do, and any perceived inactivity. Enjoy the ride, there's plenty of time until August, and I'm very confident that we're going to get it right this summer.

He's also emphatically *not* a 'Londoner who only knows/cares about London' and you can tell that just by his accent, if not from what he actually says. Maybe you can tell it from what he says, too. I'm a Londoner, so I'm not a great judge.

He worked hard and successfully over the Hillsborough thing.

He also increased his majority in his own seat at the last GE, and I suspect his success and popularity locally contributed to us winning back the other Liverpool constituency (whichever one we won, I can't remember right now).

Despite running against Ed then voting for David, he was able to be a loyal and useful ally during Ed's leadership, which says something for his ability and willingness to work toward party unity.

We were awarded 8 penalties this season (scoring 7), of which Henderson only took 1. Hypothetically, had Henderson took all of them and scored 7/8 (questionable I know) he'd have *13* goals and 15 assists, which would be fantastic. He looks to be a good leader and could be an excellent player for this club for the next 5 (or more) seasons.",null,0,null,1434469666,null,0,1434470505,0,cs8g805,null,t3_3a1spm,null,t1_cs8g805,null,t3_3a1spm,null,null,null,1437053339,null,22,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,22,null

There is no reason that I can possibly think of, unless the country, you know, had a fucking deficit and needed people in certain fields like it does now, that he should *ever* have been allowed past border control. Note that I don't believe this b.s.; I'm just using your own logic.   

You should look up Enoch Powell if you've never heard of him. You'd be a big fan. He hated immigrants with a passion based entirely on the fact they were immigrants. You should join UKIP whilst at it, although they're a bit lefty for you I suspect.  

You want skilled immigration, or so you say, and yet you want to deport skilled immigrants?   

The cognitive dissonance must hurt, but it seems you must only think in binary due to your total lack of any emotion or compassion or forward planning.  

There is no use arguing with a computer. Take care, Enochbot.

The steps towards increasing private influence in the NHS began under his predecessor Health Secretaries, especially Milburn. As I understand it, Burnham removed the 'any willing provider' clause in order to give preference to the NHS as provider rather than outsourcing. He's also done really great work on mental health issues, especially around the need to treat mental health issues as important as physical ones.

And finally, he came to speak to my old uni's Labour group in 2012 (if memory serves). He came across very positively, he was clearly very passionate about the NHS and his emphasis of mental health was really important to me. He had to pop out of his talk at one point as he was on the phone to the BBC, trying to get them to provide coverage of a leaked document which demonstrated Tory NHS privatisation plans.

This is just speculation, but after Wilshite broke onto the scene, I feel like his head inflated way too rapidly. He was England's new darling, and along with Rooney, was going to lead them to the promised land. Imo, the BEST thing for Spurs benefit/Lamela's development has been his rocky transition to the PL. There hasn't been a chance for him to get cocky (rabona aside) because all the conversation has revolved around whether he was worth the fee, how he isn't good enough, etc. His play has elevated in intensity due, partially imo, to this criticism.

Hence why when I talk about London, I always refer to the number of White Britons rather than White people. Because that is what matters to me. 

I don't buy into Multiculturalism or diversity. I don't understand why people find pride in it and I don't understand why people like to promote it. People say to me ""It makes us better as a country"" and then I'd like to point to how successful Japan and South Korea are, who are virtually all native people. 

White people being made into the smaller group just chucks all our connections with ancestors and history out of the window in my opinion. How can a country of mainly non-Britons claim our history? It is how the Greeks feel with current day Macedonians all being Slavs. Except that Slavs are white, so they don't get looked down upon for saying it.

That said, If there is a Sikh for example, whose grandfather fought for the Empire during the second world war, I would say he is more than welcome to come here (Although obviously we would need a cap, because mass immigration is still not a good thing). Their family has earned a place for them here. People who have fought and died (Or whose ancestors have) in fairly recent times for the UK deserve a place here, regardless of their background. 

I'm just not a fan of giving out free passes to people who haven't earn't it. People with skill and knowledge can come here too. But mountains of unskilled people coming here just doesn't sit well with me. You're not here because you like the country, you just want an easy way out of wherever you came from. 

How can we create a united people and culture when we have tons of people here who are kind of ok with being here, but if times get tough they will be on the first flight to somewhere else? How can you build a nation around that kind of platform? Look at Eastern Europe, all their best people leave for the West, I believe there is even a term for it. What if things go to shit here too and some of our skilled immigrants leave? We'll be in deep shit. 

No issue with the immigrants, as long as it is controlled properly and we make every effort to assimilate them into our way of life.

Now imagine this time is instead used to talk to children about things like other cultures, historical events, drugs/sex, health/fitness, topics from the news or the local community. You could even run a homework or reading club, my point is religious assemblies compared to almost anything else are a waste of time and increasing irrelevant. 


&gt; I don't think the message of that story was an immoral one...

God had the power to forgive humankind all along but instead sends his son to be tortured to death as a scapegoat for original sin which was punishment for a crime that Adam and Eve were tricked into.

You might find that the scamp decided he could get a quid for the metal.  Chains are useless for this kind of security, the phrase only as strong as the weakest link is key.  But get a cold chisel and you can stretch a link very easily, using the rest of the chain against it with two chisels.

Armoured cable is difficult to make well, whilst they flex a bit, they tend to be large, too large, so you can simply lever the lock or bottle jack it like you would a badly used D.

My point was that in a couple of generations time, the grandchildren of the polish couple will be a white Briton, while the grandchildren of the Indians will be an Asian Briton. I know many white Brits who's grandparents took asylum here during the war, you wouldn't be able to tell them apart from people who can trace their family back to the reign of Henry VIII.

My problem is that you view white Britons as different from non-white Britons, I honestly wonder why when many of their families have been here for generations.

&gt; People say to me ""It makes us better as a country"" and then I'd like to point to how successful Japan and South Korea are

Japan and South Korea aren't perfect and there are many primarily-native populated nations that are struggling, what works for one does not work for all. Generally when people talk about immigration improving the country, they are referring to low paying jobs in things like the NHS being staffed heavily by immigrants and cultures coming together to create something new (for example, if it wasn't for Africans mixing with Europeans in the US, Jazz, Rock and Blues probably wouldn't exist).

&gt; How can a country of mainly non-Britons claim our history?

National identity comes from so much more than heritage, the children of immigrants will grow up in Britain, surrounded by Britons and consuming British culture, they may feel a sense of dual-identity, but over generations their current location will have a far greater effect than the locations of their great grandparents.

That's the natural effect of long-term assimilation, I know many people who have grandparents who came from the four corners of the earth. yet they can only speak English and identify as English/British.

&gt; But mountains of unskilled people coming here just doesn't sit well with me

It doesn't sit well with me or many other British people either, you're not alone in that, but you can be pro-multiculturalism whilst being opposed to high amounts of unskilled immigration.

&gt; How can we create a united people and culture when we have tons of people here who are kind of ok with being here, but if times get tough they will be on the first flight to somewhere else?

Hate to break it to you, but if they were able to, many Brits would leave if life became uncomfortable for them or an undeniably better life was available elsewhere. So that's not just an immigrant problem, arguably people who have came here and lived ""the British dream"" would feel a bit more attachment to the land of hope and glory as they have chosen to settle here.

&gt; No issue with the immigrants, as long as it is controlled properly and we make every effort to assimilate them into our way of life.

In the early 17 century there was an influx of inferior French beef cuts which lead to the Great Meat Pontification Event.  This event lasted some 6 years and saw the finest meat judges of their time preside over a 'meat off', the details of which have to this day never been disclosed.  As you can imagine the site became awash with the blood from the numerous animal carcasses and once the decisions were cast - the French lost - their highnesses demanded the site be turned into an animal court.  This never happened as no one had the slightest idea what such a court would do.  The vast quantities of meat eaten by the judges had addled their minds and most went on to marry figments of their own imagination or in some cases of other peoples.  Fortunately the red meat diet had also damaged their hearts and they all died before the foundations for the animal court could be laid.  However, by that time the name Barons Court had been added to the deed of the land and so the name remains today.

He does indeed strike sweetly, but a free kick and a penalty are a different beast. A penalty is 50% technical and 50% psychological. Henderson, as good a player as he is, doesn't have perfect confidence in his shooting and finishing during a game (although he has popped up with important goals for us). In a penalty situation, you need to have 100% belief in your ability to score. What made Gerrard a great penalty taker was his incredible shooting ability from all distances and the self-sonfidence which goes along with this. The same goes for Baloteli. He knows he is going to score the penalty. Riise, by contrast, had an incredible shot and was a good finisher during games, but was a poor penalty taker. This was a confidence thing, in my view. He was concerned with not missing more than he was certain he'd score (if that makes sense). 

  But then again, penalties are a weird thing. By all accounts, Sturridge should be one of the best penalty takes around, but he stinks at them (or so it seems so far). The pressure on you as a penalty taker is very different from the pressure on you as a striker when you are presented with a good opportunity during open play. With a penalty, a 'keeper can make an incredible save but it will always go down as a miss for the player. Taking a penalty, the only option is to score. There is no other positive outcome. I just don't think Hendo has that absolute killer instinct and deadly confidence that penalty takers have.

Young players, especially ones that need to chunk information (opponents body language, balance, center of gravity, and ability) in order to successfully beat their man, need time in order to learn and dissect it all. Very few players are able to do this in the premier league, especially young ones who've come from a different league altogether. Hendo nor Lucas at the oddly identical ages of 21 had a similar task.

What do you mean? The UK is a Christian country, and the teachings of the Bible are a huge part of our history and cultural background.

&gt;When I was in primary school (CoE) we had daily assemblies which included hymns and stories from the Bible. A lot of the stories required mental gymnastics to see the good in them, Noah's Ark for example.

And I'm sure Christians disagree.

&gt;Now imagine this time is instead used to talk to children about things like other cultures,

As a substitute for our own culture? Yeah, no thanks.

&gt;historical events, 

History is a subject.

&gt;health/fitness

Physical education is a subject.

&gt;drugs/sex

Just a flat out no I'm afraid.

&gt;my point is religious assemblies **compared to almost anything else** are a waste of time and increasing irrelevant.

Really?

**1)** Money isn't a problem for us currently. We can net spend around 80 million quid without straining our FFP requirements.

**2)** The first issue is whether he would fit into our team and Jose's  system. The answer is YES. He won't walk into our starting XI but he is CAPABLE of playing in it. So the question is, whether spending 40 million plus on a 20 year old who's not a guaranteed starter is worth it.

**3)** Given his age and quite exceptional ability, I would have to say he very much warrants that price fee and our interest. Regardless of my love for Willian and Oscar, both do have dips in form and fitness more than seldomly and Sterling would give us wonderful quality depth and can compete for a starting position. 

**4)** One issue seems to be Sterling's quality. IMO, he's a wonderfully talented young player and has a great workrate, contrary to what some people on this sub feel. While his exceptional speed, ball control, dribbling and movement are his obvious strengths, he has his share of weaknesses. Jose can help improve his finishing, tactical awareness and positioning and most importantly, his judgment. Give his age, it's no surprise he doesn't have killer judgement but playing with our much more talented squad and great manager like Jose can really turn him into a world beater. He has a higher ceiling than Willian IMO and I would 100% love him to join us regardless of the price tag. He can be great for us for the next decade.

I find Lamela's attitude is the best attribute he has. He showed this year that he can digest, process, and execute a new system of play, gives 100% 100% of the time, and isn't content with leading the team in assists. Could he play better? Of course.

null,false,Imperito,eng-Eastanglia,East Anglia,null,"- After a few generations, yeah I'd say they've earned their place. Heck, I have some family who came from Moravia (Czech Republic, formerly in the Austrian Empire at the time) in in the 1860's, and they fought and some even died during the world wars for the UK. I just want the immigrants that do come here to actually be people who want to be here long term. I still do want a cap though.

- I fully recognise the need for immigration, there cannot be a dispute about that in my opinion. However, there is too much currently, as I previously mentioned. We have a housing crisis, services are stretched to the limit etc.

- That's good, I am glad they feel British - as I've said, it is important that any non-native immigrants who come here actually settle down and stay here. They can assimilate and contribute. 

- I'm not pro-multiculturalism. I do like certain influences, such as food or even words. Our language is a mongrel language, any good additions are welcome. However, I like British culture and I do not want to see parts of it die off due to mass immigration. Assimilation will stop this from happening. 
It does bother me to some extent that I can drive through an English town or city and in certain places, the place has a lot of people wearing those white clothes that I believe Muslims wear. I know it is a small and petty example, but that does not look like assimilation to me, and you are free to do what you want to be fair, but a White working class guy is not going to be able to identify with someone like that. I like to see them integrating and adopting our dress, or at least a more Western style. A lot do, maybe even a majority, which is nice to see. I appreciate people who make an effort to do that. 
It is a small part of creating a common culture, you have to be able to identify with people. I can identify with lots of people in this country, but there is some I cannot, and it is purely because of their choice to ignore as much of our culture as they can get away with. 

- I think a decent quote would be ""Tolerance and apathy are the last virtues of a dying society"" - And by that, it is meant to say that by just blindly tolerating everything and never seeking to improve it, we will slowly destroy society. It is fine to have people of different beliefs and backgrounds, but if we cannot get those minorities to gel with our way of life, it will be bad for everyone. I am not saying  our society will collapse, but I think it could be a valid point. Integration is essential. National identities and togetherness gets people through hard times and spurs people onto do good things. A divided community is not a good thing. And it is hard to do things when you have so many immigrants coming in at once.


- Yep, I agree, some Brits would leave. But they are born here, it is their home, I think they will be pretty attached to it. Some Immigrants genuinely admire the UK and want to be here, but some just come here for money. And although I do not blame them, I don't think we can rely on people like this. They've already left their homes, what makes you think they would stay here if they don't get what they want? 
If the immigrants all disappeared tomorrow, we'd collapse overnight, that is slightly worrying to me. I know they wont all leave, but what if something happened and a ton decided to? It'd be insanely bad.

- I'm trying my best not to appear that way, because I am honestly not racist. I don't want this country to remain mainly white because I think we are superior, it is purely about culture, heritage etc.

null,false,DanWelsh86,null,null,null,"It's not about the account itself, it's about the ISA wrapper. You're moving those funds that are shielded from income tax and capital gains to another provider, but keeping it within the wrapper.

If you take it out then you lose the wrapper, and start over. 

You can create other accounts if you wish to utilize the bonus rate with new monies, however the current one has to be transferred with that form I mentioned. It makes sense to have all your funds in the highest % account, so you can move the existing fund via the form, then top up the new account you go to with this years ISA allowance.

All the funds are kept within the ISA wrapper with one provider, as opposed to multiple accounts, some of which may have had their bonus rates expire. 

When you find an account you like, call them or pop into the branch to discuss how to transfer and they'll help. Look online for best ISA rates, to gauge the markets.

I am a qualified financial adviser, but any branch or telephone staff should be well clued up on ISAs.

Making exams about memorising twenty formulae is not the way to go about challenging pupils to do better in school, creating a better curriculum and producing extra incentives like Further Maths is.

The media, having been created for the purpose of telling people what they want to hear, has spun the story of GCSEs being incredibly easy now, so that its middle-aged readers can delude themselves into thinking that the school system has been (dare I say it) 'dumbed down' rather than accepting that their children are cleverer than them.

The government has decided that, to placate these people, they will increase the net difficulty of the exams, so that few people get good grades. If they'd done this by introducing new ways of testing students, by stretching the most able, or by fixing those ^goddamn ISAs, they'd have created a better system for teaching teenagers. Instead, they've just made them *harder*, with no regards for whether they are actually a good exam or not.

They've made sure people do worse on their exams, spouted out something about Singapore and said 'long term economic plan' half a dozen times and hoped that will fix everything.

Why is the Minister for Education a politician, not someone who is trained in the field? Everyone has opinions about 'kids these days', but the government decided to let one of those random blokes off the street come and change everything to fit his ideology.

This is total bollocks, and has nothing to do with your second point about academies (which I agree are not good).  The idea of academies where school sponsors are able to basically write their own curriculum (often a religious one) goes completely against what the new atheists are trying to achieve.

This says more about your class bigotry / snobbery than anything else I'm afraid.  Hitchens (the poster boy for new atheism, and possibly the most vocal member of the group) was a Trotskyist FFS.  He was hardly lording it over the plebs.  Quite the opposite in fact - the movement generally dislikes top-down control, where the elites use religion as a control mechanism.  One of the central ideas is to get people more epistemologically educated, so they could question their ingrained beliefs that played into the elites' hands.  There's a direct link between the ideas of the new atheists, and political commentators like Chomsky on that level.

Some insurance providers may offer to lower further if you install a tracker which logs your driving habits e.g. do you accelerate aggressively, brake suddenly etc. If you drive within their requirements then they charge you the lower rate.

null,false,landingshortly,crest,Austrian Blue,null,"Two things. First, I don't think there is any incentive at all for some of the sub-CL players to come to Everton. Yes, we are a good address in Europe but I think that even if we know it, the players also know that Everton has not got money to splash randomly around. It seems like we are very sensitive to how we spend our money and who earns what - which is an absolutely good thing to do. It's just totally out of place in terms of professional football at the moment when I see people in the Premier League get shifted around for 15 Millions without being super good while we get a Barca startlet at 2.2 Million? We are almost always for the bargain. And personally, I like that.  
  
Chicarito, Remy, Salah, ... they can earn more money elsewhere and still play. Does not have to be with us - can be in the Bundesliga, Italy, Spain, heck... even ""worse"" PL sides can offer more money because they have foreign investors. And no, I do not think that we are right under the level of CL football because there is the Europa League and English teams have struggled to earn respect in this competition for years.  
  
The reality, and I hate to say this because I will always love Everton is, that we currently placed 11th in the PL. The League that dropped to third in the UEFA league rankings. I think that us going after a solid defender from a German upper-league team says it all: this is really good for us and this is where we are at the moment. Not that it's bad at all - I'd rather be mediocre and true to the core than a corporate sellout buying league titles, but that is me and I have no grudge against anyone who thinks differently.  
  
Chicarito, Remy, Salah? Well, why not switch to any Europa League side or a lower class CL side to show what you've got on a European scale? Makes way more sense than switch to Everton where you also play but you're never really in the spotlight except for the few times where you are playing some of the bigger teams.  
  
Second thing... I think it is false to judge Deulofeu based from his previous performances for us. The setting was different after all. He wanted to show Barca what he's got and well, tried to do things on his own. Juvenile and reckless - yes... but understandable when he's on loan and wants to be seen. Now, he is ours. Now, he probably knows that Barca does not really want him. And Sevilla did not want him. We are his second chance to show that he's the player everybody saw in him. It is another setting and I am sure we will bring the best out of him. This is our reputation and we will make it happen.  
  
And on Martinez. Yes, maybe he is trying to restore what we had. But is this a bad thing? He has a vision on how we should play and in the first season, we did quite a lot of it. Then came the breakdown, now he wants to settle back where we belong. This isn't a bad thing if he tries to re-ignite the fire. Honestly, why even bother testing new players we don't know who may or may not flop when we have the talent in our team and Roberto apparently knows what he needs and who can give it to him? I think that the Deulofeu business is outstanding at 2.2M. We would have surely paid 8M a year ago when we loaned him out, so I think that Roberto hat the timing right on him.  
  
Cleverley, Deulofeu, a defender and a playmaker. This will work. Of course I want Kone replaced ASAP but Roberto sees something in him. I have no clue what, but it's not my place to judge.

I remember around ten years ago (I live in north london) I used to bike around my local town centre with my mates and there would be hardly any people walking around (weekends included). Nowadays the place is always ram-packed, you can see it with the sheer amount of immigrants/migrants walking around (yes, I know what English people look like).

I'm hardly one to hate on immigrants (I am Albanian, I came to England when I was 9), but this place really has changed.

Our house was worth 270k in 2003, now it's at the 420-430 mark. I'm a Junior Programmer, and there is no way in hell I can save enough money for a house mortgage by myself within a reasonable amount of time. A respectable one bedroom flat would set you back (if you're lucky) around £1200 a month here. All my friends are in the same position as me, we're considering renting out a house (between four of us) to save money for our house mortgages.

The way the British Government handles immigration is bullshit imo. Around two weeks ago a cousin from my dads side brought his immediate family in England from Albania. They weren't a special case or anything (high school education, not much money, that's about it), he just applied and they got accepted. The guy has been in this country for about 3 months himself!

Hell, one of my co-workers who is French tells me that her mates are all planning to come to England because there are no jobs in France. You know the rest of Europe has it bad when the French can't get jobs in France.

IMO the problem here is that the majority of EU migrants and immigrants want to move to England because they have this notion that England is all dandy and rose. Hell, if I talk to Albanians from back home they always talk about benefits. They think they can come here and just live off benefits, and they're right, that's exactly what they can do with this fucked up system.

null,false,leedsimpson,null,null,null,"Of course, but my replies do come with a disclaimer - I applied back in 2012 and although I've spoken with other people who are on the current iteration of the scheme, it's all second or third hand.

That said, when I applied, this was the process:

* Online CV
* Online Aptitude Tests 
* [Standard SEARCH Day One Assessment](https://www.policeuk.com/assessment_centre.php) (all officers take this)
* [Standard SEARCH Day Two Assessment](https://www.policeuk.com/fitness_test.php) (all officers take this)
* Graduate Assessment Centre

The graduate scheme is heavily weighted towards a uniformed management role. What I mean by that is that if you are successful, the aim is to get you to be either a Sgt or Inspector in a front line, often response team role. One of the biggest criticisms of the scheme I've seen from people who are on it now is that they joined the police to be a detective, and the scheme is too rigid to allow them to acquire any specialist skills (be that becoming a detective, armed response, TSG [public order specialists] or whatever). This has led to a lot of the would be graduate schemers trying to drop out of the scheme and stay on as regular officers.

The interview process, as you describe it, happened for me on the final assessment day, along with a few role plays and scenarios that were obviously geared towards a management role (as you'll see from the links above, the standard police assessment is geared towards gauging your reaction to incidents on the street, whereas the grad assessment day was conducted at the training facility at Bramshill, Hampshire and involved more strategic decision making and people management skills. I would say that the recruitment process for graduates as I experienced it was much more assessment orientated than it was character and CV orientated.

Do I enjoy the job? It has its ups and downs. I've always said, police tend to divide opinion. I've met people who were fully behind us and everything we do, right down to people who hate us pretty much regardless of what we do. If you can deal with that, you can do the job. I find it fulfilling, and enjoy my current role (by and large), which is a blend of front line policing and investigation. Career development wise, my intake was not provided for as well as others; student officers (sometimes referred to as probationers which references the two years you are on probation) are now generally offered the chance at placements in different departments including the CID to gauge their skill set and aptitudes. My intake was the first for a long time due to a recruitment freeze, and as a result I think the organisation were still getting to grips with how to deal with a new intake of student officers. With regard to the placements offered, the same is expected of the graduate schemers, but the placements are completed at an accelerated rate and always with the goal of a front line ranked role in mind.

It is somewhat encouraging/a bit daunting that the graduate scheme is focused towards management. That is definitely something that I would like to go towards if I did join the Met. Whilst I enjoy interacting with the public in my current job I don't think I'd like to do it forever.

It is disheartening that you describe the scheme as being too rigid for detectives. That is also something I'm very interested in but to be honest I don't think I'm clever or intuitive enough for that sort of work, I think I would be more suited for a step removed management position (if that makes sense). As far as you can possible know, would you say there's a more than likely chance that a candidate will be offered a position if they perform well on assessment? Is there such a need for Met staff that most that perform well are offered a role or has this recruitment freeze stopped that?

As I said, thanks a lot for this really great insight. Certainly helps to know what I'm looking towards if I do go down this path.

null,false,w0ss4g3,null,null,null,"I used to do tech support for ADSL a long while ago, so here goes:

First of all, get yourself to the master socket (see here: https://support.zen.co.uk/kb/Knowledgebase/Testing-connection-from-the-BT-Master-test-telephone-socket) to do your testing at the test socket. (EDIT: I noticed you said you don't have one, but that it was replaced by BT after lightning.. if they replaced things in the last 10 years they would have almost certainly installed a new-style master socket.. so you really should have one)

Now, it'll be useful to log into your router and check the connection speed (also called sync speed), usually there's info on the back of the router giving an ip address (e.g. 192.168.0.1 or something similar) and an admin username/password. Use that to login and then look for information marked ""connection information"" or ""status"".. really depends on your router. If this is nice and high (7000+ is good) and was not that high where it was plugged in before, then you've probably got some internal issue which might be intermittant.

Assuming you're on the older technology (seems very likely), then you're probably going to need to leave it plugged into there for a day or three to ensure that your line hasn't been put on a low speed profile (due to connection issues, possibly caused by your internal telephone wiring). I.e. you'll see that you're connected at a high speed, but when you download, you're still stuck at very low speeds.

If this is the case, rather than troubleshoot your whole internal wiring, you could just buy a new faceplate for your master socket which has a dedicated filtered socket.

If not, and your speeds are still rubbish from the test socket, then either your line length is very long and you're just destined for rubbish speeds, or there's a possible fault outside of your control - this is where you need to get talktalk to sort it out. However, if they're anything like they used to be, then you've got very little chance of that.


The other point I wanted to check: you say you're paying for 7mbs, and hte max you've seen 600kb/s. Do bear in mind that the connection speed is quote in Mbits/sec and your download speeds are usually reported in KBytes/sec (8 bits to a byte), so 600 isn't actually that far off the top speed you can get.

The other thing is that your neighbour is on ""1mb/s"" - are you sure they don't mean 1Mbit/sec (i.e. a max of ~125 KB/s)?

If that's the case, then maybe they were put on a very low fixed-speed connection because of the unreliability of the line (these up-to 8Mbit connections mean you can connect at far lower speeds when your line quality is poor). It may be that your line length is just too much to provide a stable high-speed connection and you'd be better off taking something slower so that you don't get such wild variation.

Anyway, feel free to ask any questions - assuming you are on the old technology then I should be able to answer most things.",null,0,null,1434486724,null,0,1434486950,0,cs8rv5m,null,t3_39tvmp,null,t1_cs8rv5m,null,t3_39tvmp,null,null,null,1437118614,null,1,false,Wales,t5_2qhrl,1,null

No-one wants to address the actual issue which is that radical Muslim communities just happen to be located in areas that are historically impoverished and that desperation is more likely to push people towards more radical ideologies... Which is exploited by a minority of genuinely radical Muslims. The causal relation isn't Muslim-&gt;radical terrorist. It's Impoverished environment-&gt;disenfranchisement from the country-&gt;being preached to by (ISIS sponsored?) radical preachers-&gt;terrorism.

It's the same reason people join cults. The same reason people join groups like the EDL, or IRA.

Islam is no worse than any other religion in this respect. For every passage talking Jihad in the Koran, there is another passage about stoning people and razing cities in the Christian bible/Jewish Torah.

EDIT: That's not to say I don't want a serious discussion about the role Islam plays in extremist acts. The problem is there isn't a serious nuanced discussion, it's either Islam does no wrong, or Islam is such an evil religion that we should take everyone professing to be Muslim and ""re-educate"" them to purge them of their wicked ways (Maybe by putting some gold Crescent moons on them and sending them to camps - because if we are going to scapegoat a religion for all problems we may as well go full pelt).

EDIT2: I mean ffs, you just got downvoted without explanation for having the audacity to dare to suggest that your average Muslim met on the street on a day to day basis doesn't supports religious murder and isn't plotting the destruction of Western society. And that a 5 minute conversation with your average British Muslim would reveal that the vast majority are just normal, average, British people.

EDIT3: Sorry to rant on like this, but I think people tend to think the left's position on Islam is advocating Radical Islamic elements. The reality is, that aside from the champagne career politician socialists in the NUS who care more about being outspoken enough to picked up by national parties than in supporting anything sensible, the left abhors radical Islam as much as every one else and would like to see the fall of ISIS. The difference is that the left accepts that radicalisation is nearly always the result of destitution in a local community - which is usually caused by wealth inequality (it's no coincidence that the country exporting the highest percentage of radical Islamists to ISIS is also the country with one of the highest income inequalities in a Western country) 

They also recognise that aggressive strategies at getting rid of radical elements that the government uses (and the public support) don't help reduce the radicalisation problem, but, if anything, actually compounds the problem - since the radical preachers then have the ammunition to go ""See! The West doesn't serve you, it only wants to oppress you, this is why what ISIS does is a Jihad and not just mindless violence!"". And attempts to censor Islam will only enhance the radical elements through the Streisand effect.

The only way to deal with the problem is to work out why there are communities who feel that their lives are so destitute that they feel their life would be better under ISIS (one thing to remember is that alongside the beheading videos, it also releases a lot of propaganda video selling the idea that it is a utopian paradise in which every Muslim is able to live freely and in a life of luxury, and treated as important) than under the UK government. Whilst people like to think that the people drawn into these cults (and I feel fine calling radical Islamic sects cults, because that's what they are) are just bloodthirsty murderers, the reality is that it takes a very desperate person to think violent revolution is the only solution to their problems.

If we analysed the circumstances in communities with radical elements, and attempt to address any issues in inclusion, and wealth inequality, and convince the community we are trying to look out for them, then we disarm the radical preachers - they can't draw in people who are happy. This is a better long term solution to the ISIS problem than what we are currently doing.

tl;dr The solution to radicalisation is to solve the problems that lead to radicalisation, and the sum of those problems isn't simply that Islam exists. It's a complex and nuanced socio-political issue, that can't be solved through black and white thinking.",null,0,null,1434486735,null,0,1434494251,0,cs8rvf3,null,t3_3a0w8f,null,t1_cs8rvf3,null,t1_cs8mhk9,null,null,null,1437118615,null,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8,null

I was kicked out of secondary school and hung around with some reprobates, so I've some first hand observations on this matter.  I'd only ever use D-Locks.  I'd use a very good one for the rear wheel, always locking through both the frame, and the wheel itself.  Locking it in a manner that makes it impossible to get any kind of crow bar in between the lock itself, and the U ring, without smushing the frame and wheel.  The more high end theifs use a [bottle jack](http://www.diy.com/departments/torq-2-tonne-bottle-jack-for-vehicle-lifting/257619_BQ.prd), you can get them on special offer for £5 from B&amp;Q, so who cares if you break them every few thefts.  They will then use a strong bit of metal, such as a crow bar, and make it so that it's pinned against the lock and the ring.  Then it's simply a matter of jacking it until it bursts, this can be done in seconds.  [Some locks have safegards against this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_76O5tGkAC0)

As such, I'd really recommend getting a good quality lock, from a brand that it is obvious.  Then a fairly cheap one for the front wheel.  Even when I was using RS10s, which are overpriced at about £100 per wheel, no one bothered to break my on-guard bulldog mini D lock, [it's only £15 on amazon!](http://www.amazon.co.uk/-Guard-Bulldog-Mini-8013-Keyed-Shackle/dp/B00AW7PE3Y/ref=sr_1_14?s=sports&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1434486636&amp;sr=1-14&amp;keywords=onguard+bulldog) because it's simply too much effort.  One good quality heavy lock, and a lighter, cheaper one for the front wheel!  I know some people suggest not to have two locks of the same kind, because ""theifs have to carry two sets of tools"", this is just dumb.  One good set of bolt cutters will not only cut more wire locks, but some cheap Ds too, or even just act as a leaver for a chain lock.

I'm really only passing on a criticism that I hear from current graduate schemers - a lot of them want to be detectives and investigators, but it is a specialist role that requires quite a bit of extra training around case law and evidence procedure. The Met's goal is to fast track graduates into management positions, and as a result, doesn't want graduate schemers ""wasting time"" turning their PC into a DC when they could be turning it into a PS or Insp. One thing to keep in mind is that there are internal high potential fast track schemes once you're in the job, and you then have the flexibility to specialise before you apply for them. Personally, in all honesty, I'm glad I joined as a regular applicant once I failed the graduate recruitment. It's been better for my development as a whole and I feel I have the freedom to choose what I want to do with the benefit of experience behind me.

As to whether you are clever or intuitive enough, only you can say - but I will say that the Met offers some of the best training in the world for detectives (again, based on what I have heard). As an investigator myself, what I will say is that it is not so much about drawing massively conclusive insights vis-a-vis Sherlock Holmes, it is more a systematic approach and making sure every avenue available gets investigated. Although I won't deny a bit of creativity sometimes helps!

*EDIT: Episode 2 of the current documentary on the Met is worth watching to get an idea of the investigation side of things.*

I'm not sure what you mean by if a candidate performs well will s/he be offered the role? If you mean, are there so many applicants that performing well on the assessments just means you're in the lottery for the chosen few places, I honestly couldn't tell you. I think that the Met most probably has a large number of places to hire for as there are still shortages; I didn't make the cut and I got average scores in the graduate assessment, but good scores on the normal police day. The recruitment freeze is over, and the Met has been on a recruitment drive since 2012.

Oddly enough, my aunt works in the Foreign Office and she says the Civil Service Fast Stream is a very lucrative career path, but a good (First, 2 :1) degree in a relevant subject is essential.

That's crazy. 

Consumer laws are on your side. You buy online, and you get the lowest prices, and you also get the benefit of a 14-day cooling off period in case you change your mind, you get the item delivered to your door intact, and if you buy from a reputable retailer like Amazon, you'll be safe with a warranty for the specified period, be it one year, two, three, or however more, and if it does fail within that time, they'll pick it up from your door.

You buy from PC World, or any real-world shop, and you get high prices, no right to refund if you change your mind or don't like it, no comeback if you damage the TV during the journey between the shop and your house, and if it fails at any other point, with PC World / DSG, they won't even talk to you outside of the 28 day window they allow for returns. You'll need to take it up with the manufacturer directly. You'll also need to arrange shipping or transportation yourself. That won't be cheap.

Legislation like the Distance Selling Act has made online purchasing by far the better option, in my opinion. Personally, I wouldn't even consider making a £600 purchase in a shop these days.

Non-PL - Aspas/Alberto/Ilori/Balo/Mark/Moreno/Origi/Couts/Sakho/Manquillo/Can

Breaking it down further into 'proven' players.

PL under Rodger - Sturr/Mil/Lall/Migs/Lovren/Lambert = 5

Non PL under Rodger - Aspas/Balo/Sakho/Moreno (kind of, was brought to start). = 4

Breaking it down further into 'expensive proven' players.

PL under Rodger - Lallana/Migs/Lovren

Non-PL - Balo/Sakho


Also here is some 'expensive potential'

PL under Rodger - Allen/Mignolet

Non-PL - Mark/Sakho

And why not unbreak it down for potential:

PL - Allen/Ings/Migs/Sturridge (on border I guess, he always done well as striker but never got played there consistently outside of bolton). = 4

Non-PL - Moreno (brought in to start, but also expect improvement)/Can/Albert/Ilori/Mark/Origi/Couts/Sakho (as in he was proven to be decent, but expected him to go up a level while here).  = 8


so vague transfers, probably missing like 5 players equal **18 total**, **12 potential**, **6 proven**, probably allen/can/sakho/moreno fit into both first team and expected to improve

If you pick the right trade you can earn a very decent amount of money for not a lot of work and also gain some decent qualification if you were to progress far enough.

Can't comment on the RAF but from what I've seen it is a hell of a lot less bullshitty than the army and they have a reputation for staying in hotels and the such while we get put up in accomodation from the 60's.

But clubs don't get to keep most of the shirt sale revenue. In fact, kit manufacturers keep most of the revenue.

To elaborate on that, I don't think he can be a holding midfielder for us, especially not for the season coming up, if he went on loan with the agreement he could learn to play that role and had a successful spell, then give him a go, definitely. But I think most people have got incredibly high expectations of Ilori and I'm not really sure where it's come from.

He's only made 12 appearances for Bordeaux this season and whatever you think of Sakho, Skrtel, Toure &amp; Lovren, all four are better than Sané Planus &amp; Sertic and he's not been able to displace them from Bordeaux's first team.

If some shitbags take advantage of that system, so be it. I'd rather the most in need got help and not be punished for the actions of the few who are 'career benefits claimants'. I've been lucky enough to never have to claim any sort of benefits, but I know that if I or my family were in trouble, we'd be able to rely on a small amount of income while we got back on our feet jobwise. I wouldn't really be able to hold down a full time 'job' for my JSA and effectively jobsearch, it's catch 22.      

1. I would argue that spending the time tailoring CVs to each job would be a better use of a claimant's time than performing a full time 'job' and then still be expected to find employment.   


2. If you work hard, you will still be recycled for more free labour when your time is up at that store. Don't kid yourself. Why pay fulltime when they can just use free labour provided by the government?

Now all anyone can talk about is how awesome it would be to sign Kovacic and (I am guessing from now on) Firmino. Both of which are ""ones for the future"" that will be stupid expensive and play the exact same position as our best player (Coutinho) and our most expensive recent signing (Lallana).

Labour and Tories together take the majority of votes, around 60+%ish. With their huge spending power for the FPTP campaign and voters who will blindly toe the line they'll win.

- Log on to the Jobmatch site daily and record the login with a note on the right hand side. Record everything you can here as it's all digitally recorded and can't be challenged by the job centre staff.
- Type up a CV and make a cover letter template that can be quickly tweaked for the mass job applications. Say you've spent longer on each application than you have.
- Record everything in the book / paper provided. They will check this weekly/fortnightly. Twitter searches, Google searches, all the job sites you visit. Read the local paper? Record it as a job search. Went to the corner shop or into town? Say you looked in the shop windows for job adverts. Think outside the box. If you have a printer at home or local library then print every e-mail receipt of each job application you do as proof.

Do all of this box filling shite and in the mean time identify 1 or 2 jobs each week that you genuinely think you can do and really spend some quality time (recorded of course) making a fucking quality application. Over time this will speed up and you'll find you can do more quality applications each week as you get into the swing. Be shameless and start asking friends and family about where they work and if there are any jobs going - from the bottom of the business to the top. 

I was unemployed up until August last year. This tactic paid off for me. Nothing I did for the job centre helped me obtain the job I am in right now. I spent 1 day a week completing quality applications. These were always the ones that got responses as either rejections or invite to interview. However it would take me a couple of hours per application to properly do the forms, check them, re-draft the cover letter, check the answers to questions, etc. 

I would also suggest expanding your field of view. I never thought I would be in the job I am in now in a million years but it provides a pay cheque and the days go quickly.

This is what happened with Lukaku, Deulofeu, and to a lesser extent Townsend last season. Then, since players are human and we have a great club culture, they may even as an added bonus decide to come back to us, like Deulofeu and Lukaku. 

We may not be able to sign any of those players, but we could definitely loan them. And you know what else? Players like Amrabat are a whole different ball game. Players that are starring for their teams that are around equal to us in equal leagues. Players that are standing out for Malaga or Villarreal could easily do well for Everton, because those teams honestly are equal or better to Everton.

Teams and fans don't respect us many claim we're just a little mid table side and the worst thing is they're not exactly wrong. We are never going to win the league or come close to it without serious investment that's just a fact and if we did get a huge investment and spent millions I don't know if I'd be happy honestly. I look at City just buying leagues and I just think how can any fan think they deserve their success. Yeah I'm sure the players like it there but who wouldn't on ridiculous wages. They have no loyalty to City whatsoever and perhaps that is just the ideal of a modern footballer but I like to at least believe that is different with Everton. I mean there's constant talks of players leaving the big teams with relatively no backlash but when Mirallas made these claims of wanting more the reaction was huge. In a way this made me proud because it is such a foreign concept that a player wouldn't want to play for us anymore. Given I've only been a fan since the Moyes era so whenever a player left it was more than likely for budget issues and nothing more. If we can become a great though development of young players and shrewd purchases I would be ecstatic but if some foreign billionaire with no idea of football came in and we won the league it'd be bitter sweet because no way would we deserve it. I mean say what you will about Bill and the board but fuck me at least they care about the club. We could have a Vincent Tan. We could have worse. I would say without money we are easily one of the best in England and the world. I mean people have compared our youth setup to that of Barcelona.

Obviously you can't cover rent with that, so most people on JSA will also be eligible for Housing Benefit (unless their partner is working and covering the rent or the house is owned outright, in which case you just get your JSA).

There's Council Tax Benefit, since people on £60/wk obviously also aren't going to be able to stump up £1000/yr for council tax. There are other exemptions to council tax - students are exempt, and if you are a single occupant in a house, you can normally get a discount based on the fact you are generating less rubbish/sewage, etc than if you were living with more people.

People on JSA also get free prescriptions.

Aside from JSA, the other big one is Incapacity/Disability Benefit for people who can't work (rather than being out of work but seeking). Being on Disability may open up other benefits such as Housing &amp; Council Tax Relief.

You also get Income Support, which augments incomes for people who are under-employed or very low paid and can only maybe get 10 hours a week on minimum wage. The government would rather bolster their income to something they can live on than have them quit and go on JSA because they can't live on what they're being paid.

People with kids can get Child Benefit/Tax Credits/whatever it's called this week. Single parents can also get quite a lot of support since it's assumed they may not be able to go out and work, so they may be able to claim housing and living allowances.

People getting pregnant and having a ""tactical baby"" to make them eligible for a raft of benefits is not as common as the Daily Heil would have you believe, but does happen. People also don't get married specifically because if you're technically a single parent you can get more benefits. If you were living with a partner who was employed, then claiming housing allowances and such would be benefit fraud, but people do do it, and it's not always very easy to detect if someone is doing all the paperwork in their name and getting the government/council to cover all their housing and living costs, but their unmarried partner is quietly working and supplying a stack of disposable income on the quiet instead of paying the rent.

Individuals who care for disabled people can also claim a Carer's Allowance, which is generally more cost-effective for the government than paying for the disabled individual to have a nurse or professional carer.

What people forget is actually one of the biggest benefits (and the fastest rising as the baby boomers hit retirement) is State Pension, along with the Winter Fuel Allowance and Cold Weather Allowance to help cover gas and heating bills.

Millions of pensioners, and growing!

null,false,tulks,null,null,null,"Hey. I've got two years experience within recruitment - one working for an agency providing interim HR staff, then moved in house for a fairly large UK retail company. Left just under a year ago for a complete career change. This was in Central London so may differ depending on your location.

Agency - long, tiring work! I worked 8 - 6.30 every day with a 10 minute break at lunch to grab some food. Very target driven, we had monthly, weekly, daily... and hourly targets to hit. People could be ruthless when it came to hitting targets and making sales.

Day broke down as follows:
7.30 - 9am: Sourcing new candidates, calling and telephone interviewing, registering candidates in office, general admin, reference checking
9- 12 : core calling hours to generate new business
12 - 2: Candidate and admin work
2 - 5: core calling hours
5 - 6.30: Candidate and admin work

When a job came in I would write up an advert, call candidates on books, book interviews etc. Lots of administration, reference checking, CRBs etc. etc. 

Hire process was fairly straight forward, I used a rec-to-rec agency who interviewed me and put me forward for the agency, had a first stage interview with my eventual team manager then second stage interview with one of the directors.

Left the role as I grew tired of the long hours and high pressure to hit targets.  In house is a lot calmer, less pressure target wise but no incentive as no commission based pay! Focus is completely on candidates that come in rather than generating new business (obviously). The problem with this is that it can be quite boring without that pressure and the thrill you get with a big sale.

Not sure if I have been helpful or not... any questions let me know.

The best thing about him for me is that he looks to get forward as often as he can, if he spots an opening ahead of him you can be sure he is going to take advantage. Watching us play this year could get a bit tiresome with our stagnant passing and we are desperate for a player exactly like Deulofeu, someone to create a spark and open up some space for players like Barkley and even McCarthy to work with.
