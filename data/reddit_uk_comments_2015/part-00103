Toure was extremely lazy today. Fernandinho was the opposite. That's not how it's supposed to be.

Nasri was bad and a liability and when Navas came on, we started attacking much better. Navas was also vital defensively as he tracks back and is able to keep up with Alba. Good sub by Pellers.

Dzeko has more experience than Bony, so I think he should have gone on instead, but then again hindsight is 20/20. Bony probably has impressed in training.

The Lampard sub was routine. He either does something great or become invisible. Since we had less possession, he was the latter.

I think Pellegrini's tactics were alright. It was all he could have done and the rest was the players' job. I don't think he should be sacked and I don't think he will.

Defensively, we were horrible, but then again offensively (aside from the finishing) Barca were amazing. So it was understandable, considering it was only half of our best back four. Joe Hart saved them. Thinking about his performance makes this whole thing better. 

Offensively, our crossing was woeful. There were too many long range shots, although I guess you have to take them you have the chance. Navas was great, but his delivery wasn't, as I mentioned already. Aguero was isolated, but he did come back and get the ball and made one-twos. I don't think he did too badly. Milner was defending most of the game. Silva was decent, but couldn't make an impact. I think Yaya Toure shouldn't be played as a defensive midfielder if we aren't going to get the bulk of possession. He doesn't try defensively at all. Whether that's his age or his attitude, I don't know, but we can't have that on the field.

I didn't expect us to get through Barca. They are ridiculously good. If Aguero put in his penalty, there might have been a different story, but that's gone now. I think we did well, all things considered. We didn't get thrashed and we did have some great spells of play that scared Barca and gave me false hope. But still...

4. Racist is a convenient shorthand for being xenophobic, culturally intolerant and otherwise bigoted.

In a zero-hours situation, an employer can just stop offering an employee shifts indefinitely, while still having them on the books as an ""employee"". Then when the employee leaves, they are deemed to have done so of their own accord (with no entitlement to higher rate JSA, notice period, etc) and face an uphill battle to make a constructive dismissal claim as well, where if they were on a conventional contract they would have an open-and-shut case. 

Yes, zero-hours works in some corner cases; predominantly where both parties are in a position to conduct good-faith bargaining over pay and conditions up-front, usually for work which is highly skilled or related to a particular talent (like a TV presenter, for instance), or for work which is ""unusual"" by dint of the employee and employer's relationship (like university lecturers who are also (post-)graduate students, though the use of zero-hour contracts for these is also extremely contentious, as the UCU demos and strikes last year showed). 

The routine use of zero-hours contracts for ""normal"" working patterns, where the employee doesn't have a strong negotiating position from the start, and where most employees will be working a relatively constant number of hours most of the time, is an active effort to defeat the purpose of our employment law and shirk an employer's obligations to their worker.

I'm a bit sceptical of the assumption that there wasn't any significantly large scale population movement before 1885- Historically Britain's coming towards the end of the industrial revolution and I think there must have been quite a bit of population movement during that era. 

I suppose the main surprise from the survey is the lack of Norse or Danish genetic clusters- It's possible though that given how close the Danes are ethnically to the Angles and Saxons it means they don't appear distinguished in the survey.

The reason I and so many other Americans dont play your version of football is our version of football happens at the same time of the season. Playing Amercan football gets you respect and prestige here but your version does not. I always opted to play American football because I loved the violence of the game and I was good at it. Im out of school now and sports are more something I watch these days. The speed, chemistry, and footwork of your football blows my mind. Ive also noticed that the more I watch, the quicker I can see a play unfolding. Sometimes I feel like I can see the play developing 30 seconds before a goal is scored. The flow just feels right, and the passes are clean, and I can almost project how the play is going to unfold and turn into a goal. I used to just focus on one single player, but now I can see the whole field and which direction every player is moving simultaneously. Kinda like I see the bigger picture, if that makes sense. ITs been more interesting since I started to watch the game differently, because before all my eyes saw was the ball and who had it..Now Im watching the players without the ball and anticipating whats going to happen before it happens.

However they haven't been relegated from the Premier League, which started in 1992.  Villa essentially founded the Football League back in 1888 and was one of the first dominate teams in England.

2)Yes, the club is for sale, this 'turmoil' has been going on pretty much all season

3)Online streaming.  You'll find match threads here on /r/avfc that have links to streams.

4)It seems to me that they will inevitably be sold, the club needs money.  Ashley Young, Stewart Downing, James Milner, and Dwight Yorke are some of the talents to have played for us before moving on, whenever a player excels with us, they get scooped up by bigger clubs.

Villa also develop lots of youth players themselves, and is known for the quality of their youth academy, which is great because it means a lot of local kids get to play for Villa(Gabriel Agbonlahor is a prime example of this)  Daniel Sturridge, Gary Cahill, and Gareth Barry are all Villa youth products",null,0,null,1426734471,null,0,false,0,cpjiqqh,null,t3_2zjjpj,null,t1_cpjiqqh,null,t3_2zjjpj,null,null,null,1427848338,null,3,false,avfc,t5_2s569,3,null

This season, which is another round of 16 exit in CL, and appears to be a 2nd or 3rd place finish in the EPL, shows this team needs change. I wouldn't mind any players being sold except Aguero and Silva. They need a new attacking mid fielder who is better than any of the guys they have now. They need a new holding midfielder and hopefully will dump the Brazilian duo of bad. They REALLY need to overhaul the defense. It is old, and has been quite bad lately. But I can't blame the defense, a team who spends money like this needs to score goals. Aguero is as good as they come when he is in form but he needs help around him. If Pellegrini needs to go, so be it. Bring someone in that will plan differently for each game. This team plays wide open against lowly EPL teams that a 1-0 victory should be easy to achieve, and then play conservative and unaggressive against the power house teams. They are built like a world class team, they need to play like one.

Sturridge surely isn't firing on all cylinders like he did last season and it's unlikely that he'll find his boots anytime soon but and it's big BUT, what he can provide is the movement which I think no other player in the team can do.

Sturridge's movement allows others (even mid-fielders) to get in on the action and get into the box. His movement was a big miss during the time when Sterling played in the center because Sturridge clever positioning gives us a lot of options in that there is no doubt and I think we cannot afford to lose him at the moment.

On another note, one massive worry for us though is that there is no proper source from where goals can come for us as of now and as was mentioned by TAW. We have a great system in place but no one in our team dominates or drives the players like Suarez did last season and considering the pressure and the competition we are in now, it;s a worry.

You again point out doing a bit of skill to win a free kick means we should rate that moment, ignoring my comparison to another player who used to exactly that and not play for us. Assaidi often did very skillfull moves, does that make him good enough to start? No.

You are ridiculously biased sat here calling a fan of the club for 23 years biased against one individual. Pot Kettle BLACK. I support every player that wears the badge, but I do not hype people up or make excuses for average performances. 

I'm sick to death of you in this sub. You are not a fan of this club, you are a biased fan of a player that plays here. You do not get the right to say how I feel about Balotelli, as quite frankly I think he's alright to have as an option. I watch my team religiously, often watching a game again to see how each player does while I'm not engrossed by what the result might be.

I rate players as I see them and I am fucking sick of people like you ignoring everyone elses arguments because you have a soft spot for the player. 

I've defended players like Joe Allen to the death who get hated on here and /r/soccer (until recently), I'm not afraid to be controversial. 

I do not rate Mario Balotelli as anything more than a good player after YEARS of watching him too. I didn't think he'd add much and he hasn't. I can't stand his apologist brigade.

You confuse my dislike of the apologists who slag off our manager for not playing him, our captain for speaking against him, and Sturridge for daring to question if he should take a penalty. I hate people that seem to have forgotten to support the club, not some flamboyant personality.

null,false,jackgrealish,,Can I change my own flair?,null,"Everything you need to know about the Villa (a guide for the American):

1. Villa have one of the richest histories in world football. Not only did they help found the league, but they were also one of the first 'major' clubs in the world. They won the European Cup in the 80's and have never been relegated from the Premier League.

2. Recent times have proven difficult for Villa, but it was not long ago that we were challenging the English elites. Villa beating Chelsea in 2008 would not have been an upset. Villa smashed teams just a few years ago. Between 2008 and 2011, Villa qualified for Europe 3 times. Villa produced such talents as Young, Barry, Milner and Downing.

3. Villa Park is incredible. Go. The atmosphere is a bit down but DAMN it is an incredible place.

4. Villa have a great youth setup. Although it has been slightly lacking under the guidance of McLeish and Lambert, Tim is sure to get the youth academy firing again. Recent youth players (who are playing competitively) include: Bannan, Albrighton, Weimann, Clark, Agbonglahor, Cahill, Barry, Sturridge, C. Gardener and G.Gardener. I love youthful teams because it shows confidence and excitement. Villa have this in many youth talents today (including Jack Grealish). 

NBCsports shows every game, every week, no matter what time. I recommend looking into splitting the cost up amongst other premier league fans in your dorm/area. Then there is always azza and other streamers on r/soccer. 

I have supported Villa for 10+ years of my short life and have been to Villa Park 3 times for matches. 

Also, show your support, find other supporters near you (in a pub or fans club) and be active in this sub!!

P.S. Where do you live, I can try to connect you with fans if you live near me or my friends.

I'm not going to rank the specials, but the top one is Day of The Doctor



I had a tough time ranking series 5 vs. 7. I thought 7a was awful, but really like 7b, especially the way Eleven changed. 5 had overall better writing, but Eleven doesn't feel like himself yet most of the time, and it bugs me.

Also series 2 vs. 3. I Like Martha a lot more than Rose, but most of the series is really mediocre to me. Whereas series 2 has a few really great episodes and 3 terrible ones. Considering I had to force myself to pick a #3 for series 3, that lost.",null,0,null,1426741189,null,0,false,0,cpjlvro,null,t3_2zjhja,null,t1_cpjlvro,null,t1_cpjkdsy,null,null,null,1427849821,null,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2,null

Our new CEO Tom Fox has come along as basically said that we *should* be a much bigger and better club capable of holding on to our greatest players. We've lacked the marketing for years now, and in recent years it's true that we have sold our best players. I don't think Tom Fox would want us to do that anymore. I expect us to have much more of a ""We are not selling Benteke, he is not for sale"" outlook from now on. 

We should be on Tottenham's level, at the level Everton were at last season, where Southampton are at the moment. Attracting great players, challenging for Europe. Unfortunately we've been slipping for years. It's looking more positive since Sherwood took over and he said he wants to build a great team and propel us up the table. We'll be waiting with bated breath.

&gt;[Aston Villa F.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C.) have supported *Acorns* since 2006 and has already paid for 230 days' worth of hospice care. Several players have visited the children and families who use Acorns. Acorns highlighted the need for further assistance to aid the extra thousand children in the local area who needed the assistance of Acorns. Aston Villa responded by offering a platform to advertise the Hospice to a wider audience. On 7 July 2008, the club unveiled the kit for the [2008–09 season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008-09_in_English_football) which has the Acorns logo in the position associated with the main kit sponsor. An Acorns spokesperson said ""We are absolutely delighted that our logo will be seen at every home and away match during the 2008–09 season, helping to raise awareness of our work and of the constant need by all children’s hospices to fundraise. This really is the beginning of an amazing partnership, believed to be the first of its kind in the [Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League).""  The deal was extended for the [2009–10 season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League_2009-10).  For the 2010–11 season onwards, Acorns is Aston Villa's Official Charity Partner.  When [Marc Albrighton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Albrighton) scored the 20,000th goal in Premier League history, he chose Acorn's as the charity to receive the £20,000 prize donation.

Zero hour jobs aren't so bad if your employer isn't a cunt. But for a lot of people out there - even though they're still a minority - zero hour contracts are being used by cuntish employers to screw them over.

As someone explained elsewhere in this thread:

&gt; In a zero-hours situation, an employer can just stop offering an employee shifts indefinitely, while still having them on the books as an ""employee"". Then when the employee leaves, they are deemed to have done so of their own accord (with no entitlement to higher rate JSA, notice period, etc) and face an uphill battle to make a constructive dismissal claim as well, where if they were on a conventional contract they would have an open-and-shut case.

Thanks for your call on 18 March about the poor driving and offensive behaviour of a bus driver on route C3. I'm sorry for any distress that a driver caused you at Earl's Court.

The safety of our customers and road users is our highest priority. We go to great lengths to train our bus drivers to very high standards. Poor driving or driving without due care is simply unacceptable.
 
I've brought your complaint to the attention of Abellio London, the bus operating company that runs the route C3 for us. With the information you've provided, the driver will be identified. When a complaint like this is made, a manager will call the driver in for an interview. After this, based on the findings, appropriate action will be taken..
 
Our operators manage and improve drivers' behaviour in a number of ways. A driver can be paired with a mentor, take part in conflict avoidance classes and attend further customer service and driver awareness training.
                                                        
Quality Incentive Contracts help deliver improvements to bus services. Bus operators are regularly assessed on customer care. Complaints about poor driving and poor conduct are marked against targets. It's in the bus operating companies' interest to meet and exceed these targets, otherwise we won't extend their contracts.
 
Once again, I'm very sorry to learn what happened and understand this must have been deeply upsetting for you. It's really important for us to meet and exceed our customers' expectations. This means your feedback will help us improve our services.

For example. In a situation in the EPL where we play a big team away, then yeah it sounds reasonable to play the way we do. Defence wins games, and I would never trade it for anything else, the result is more important than some flair.. otherwise we'd end up like arsenal. such ""beautiful football"" but it comes at the expense of a humiliating battering every once in a while. (United 8-2, Liverpool 5-1, us 6-0, etc..).

However, in a situation when we are HOME against a 10 man PSG and decide to play defensively.. that's where I feel Mourinho chooses to be a little too cautious. If we want to be considered an elite team in europe, we can't be trying to win ties with 0-0's.. Yes, play for the draw away, but bring them back to the bridge and give them hell. *Go for the win*. The quality is certainly there, there's a man advantage, and we're at home. Its inevitable the they'll score if we just sit back and let them attack without punishing them. Just take a look at the time between when Luiz scored the header, and hazard scoring from the spot. *Thats* how you play against 10 men. Unfortunately, that went out the window once again when Hazard scored. Why must we always put ourselves in a position like that to play better? Same thing happened at old trafford, at city, burnley etc.. 

That being said, while mou's tactics (imo) weren't the best, a large part of that defeat came down to the players as well. Where was the team that is so often praised for working hard off the ball, pressing, closing down spaces and forcing errors? We had to be reminded every 5 minutes from Gary Neville that our players were walking around the pitch and looking flat. How is it that a team consisting of the mighty strike force of TORRES and BA able to show more determination and spirit than this team? Last year when PSG came to the bridge we pressed and pressed until we finally got the 2 goals we needed after hitting the woodwork twice. To be fair though, Matic was lacking in fitness (he was huffing in puffing by 30 minutes), and Cesc wasn't in his preferred position. This game also reminded me of the city game in the first half of the season. They were also down to ten men and once again we sit back and don't take advantage, and they equalize. 

All in all, I agree with you that our style is not one we should necessarily change as it wins games, but sometimes it shouldn't be applied as extensively, as it's shown to cost us late in crucial games.

Exclusivity (and preferential-employer) clauses are just the latest excess.

Exactly - zero hours contracts are great if you actually have flexible hours, but the employers using them on their full-time, fixed working week staff (especially in cases where seasonal or fixed-term rolling contracts might have been used in the past) are doing so to avoid redundancy pay and other employment legislation. They get flexibility; their employees get instability and uncertainty. You can literally be working a full-time office job for months at a time, and then (with only a week's notice) be told that you won't be needed for 6 months. Effectively, you're unemployed, but the distinction of ""merely"" having your hours taken to zero makes getting out-of-work benefits far more complicated.

Likewise, if your baseline for standards of corruption is zero then of course it is “rife” in Britain, just like racism is “rife”, domestic violence is “rife” or anything else that exists at all is “rife”.

Monbiot is probably right that we should reform the tax system, the snooper state and the City of London, and also right that the problems facing rich countries differ from those of poorer ones. We have problems that should be worked out.

&gt; Almost every day the news is filled with stories that look to me like corruption.

Yes, and every day the road between my house and work is filled with twats†. Doesn't mean they all are.

&gt; Either all but 13 countries are spectacularly corrupt or there’s something wrong with the index.  
  
Or it's a graded scale and the ""top 14 countries"" represents an arbitrary cut-off point on that scale. Like saying ""The temperature of the triple point of water is defined as precisely 273.16 K, but this means that lots of things have a triple point well below that point on the scale and as this is clearly absurd there's something wrong with the scale.""  
  
&gt; The definitions of corruption on which it draws are narrow and selective.  
  
All definitions are selective. That's the nature of definitions. However [""Corruption is the abuse of entrusted power for private gain.""](http://www.transparency.org/whatwedo) hardly sounds controversial (although the dictionary definition is [slightly different](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=define+corruption&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=FYoKVYfAGMP0UuC2hMAH)).  
  
&gt; Common practices in the rich nations that could reasonably be labelled corrupt are excluded; common practices in the poor nations are emphasised.  
  
OK, which ones? Neither the Guardian nor the [fully referenced article](http://www.monbiot.com/2015/03/18/hard-graft/) specify them.  
  
&gt; Would there still be commercial banking sector in this country if it weren't for corruption?  
  
Yes.  

&gt; Among the sources used by Transparency International to compile its index are the World Bank and the World Economic Forum. Relying on the World Bank to assess corruption is like asking Vlad the Impaler for an audit of human rights.  
  
But they don't [rely solely](http://files.transparency.org/content/download/1857/12438/file/CPI2014_DataBundle.zip) on the World Bank and the World Economic Forum. Their full list of sources is:  
  
African Development Bank Governance Ratings  
Bertelsmann Foundation Sustainable Governance Indicators  
Bertelsmann Foundation Transformation Index  
Economist Intelligence Unit Country Risk Ratings  
Freedom House Nations in Transit  
Global Insight Country Risk Ratings  
IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook  
Political and Economic Risk Consultancy Asian Intelligence  
Political Risk Services International Country Risk Guide  
World Bank - Country Policy and Institutional Assessment  
World Economic Forum Executive Opinion Survey (EOS)  
World Justice Project Rule of Law Index  
  
The point being that using multiple indexes to check corruption is more likely to be a better indicator than using one or two sources, which is what Monbiot is implying the Index does.  
  
&gt; Yes, many poor nations are plagued by the kind of corruption that involves paying bribes to officials.  
  
i.e. the dictionary definition of 'corruption'.
  
  
The CPI isn't infallible and it doesn't imply there isn't work to be done here, but it's not the only guide to corruption, and to imply that ""the small matter of our unreformed political funding system, which permits the very rich to buy political parties"" is on a par with [political corruption in Angola](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_in_Angola) is just bloody-mindedness.

It says that during the founding of the statelet, James Craig etc wanted the union to be called ""Great Britain and Ulster"". 'Ulster' was the preferred term as it had ancient resonance when compared to the artificial sounding ""Northern Ireland"" which was invented by an Act of Parliament. However, London wouldn't permit that as it was technically inaccurate, because Ulster is 9 counties in which they couldn't gerrymander a majority. So, the union became known as Great Britain and Northern Ireland. For tourism purposes, however, 'Ulster' kept being peddled and promoted.

One academic makes a good point:

&gt; I think one of the ironies for the Northern Ireland state's obsession with the idea of 'Ulster'... is that they had abandoned three counties of the province of Ulster when they decided that the 6 county state was the only one that could survive. So, they had in fact dismantled the province of Ulster for themselves, yet remained obsessed with keeping it together as an imaginary place",null,0,null,1426755693,null,0,1426768057,0,cpjpv9y,null,t3_2zkaeg,null,t1_cpjpv9y,null,t3_2zkaeg,null,null,null,1427851688,null,14,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,14,null

More people like zero hour contracts than people who don't. Democracy rules buddy. 

&gt; so screw you and how it may have worked for you, because some jimmie rustling is far more important than looking at both sides of the argument.

I  have looked at both sides. I worked zero hour contracts for years (no problem with them at all) and now i'm working full time after finishing uni (which was funded by my zero hour contract) . 

You people just want everything handed to you on a plate. That's the real matter of the 'problem' here. You want zero hours with a fixed income and you want a job that's entirely flexible with your schedule. Grow up lol That'll never happen. You'll have an extremely hard time trying to find that in a full-time permanent job, nevermind in some shitty retail shop, sitting behind a till serving customers all day. What makes you all think you are so entitled? I see people in here calling for bans on zero hours... lol.. That will just mean those jobs will be removed from the market and you'll all be even worse off.

Don't be deceived in to thinking that the tax revenue comes only out of reduced dividends for shareholders.

Estimates vary a lot because where the tax actually falls is quite opaque. That's one reason politicians and the public like it: they all think someone else pays it, not them.

Much better would be a dividend tax, and for many reasons (personally I favour making a start on this by equalizing tax rates across different kinds of income - ie, abolishing corporation tax and NI and rolling the whole lot in to income tax).

That happens more than you would think. A lot of the time, when faced with discrimination, people do just go to another shop. Being involved in a case like this is extremely stressful.

Equally well, 'just going to another shop' is extremely stressful and dehumanising. Suppose my landlord decided his deeply-held beliefs prevented him from allowing my boyfriend to stay overnight in my flat. Should I just go and find another flat? Suppose my boss decided his deeply-held beliefs meant straight people could bring partners to the office Christmas party but gay people could not, should I just get another job? Suppose a waiter decided his deeply-held beliefs meant he could not serve us while we were on a date, should we just go to another restaurant?

What do we do when all landlords have the same deeply-held beliefs, all the bosses have the same deeply-held beliefs, all the waiters have the same deeply-held beliefs, and all the bakers have the same deeply-held beliefs?

Edit: turns out it depends on the measure you use.

&gt;Keen to blunt Labour’s attack, Mr Osborne boosted the assumed spending totals in 2019-20 by £20bn, enough almost to put the public finances back into the red.

&gt;This to ensure that Total Managed Expenditure, the broadest measure of government spending, dipped only to 36 per cent of national income in 2019-20. This places the share of Britain’s state at the end of the decade a touch above other lows in 1999-00, when Labour was in power, and in 1957-58.

&gt;The other main political parties took a rather different view. Using another measure of public spending — government consumption of goods and services — which excludes pension and benefit spending, the Liberal Democrats argued you had to go back 50 years to see such a small state.

&gt;They correctly calculated that the cuts to income would reduce government consumption as a share of national income from 19.9 per cent today to a low point of 15.9 per cent in late 2018. This would be the lowest since 1964.

The help they need is government loans to cover the £15,000 deposit, just like a student loan (but one that gets paid back because after 25 years, the family are so much better off since they've paid for their mortgage).

There's lots of caveats that will have to be accounted for (people moving mid-mortgage, people on low incomes) but they can all be dealt with, and any problems it causes have surely got to be less substantial than the house crisis.

null,false,MouMoneyMouProblem,null,null,null,"For starters I love Mourinho, I think he's the best manager in the world, and I think by the end of his career he'll have a very strong argument as the best manager of all time. 


But... I don't really trust him to be the one to take advantage of what seems like a very strong youth set up at the moment. At his core Mourinho is a very pragmatic manager, he's a manager that time after time has relied on experienced players, a manager that when his back is against the wall will revert to a more defensive stance, a reactive manager that tends to look at how to nullify the opposition rather than how to overwhelm them. None of this is necessarily a bad thing, and it's all a big part of why he has been so successful at delivering trophies year after year, in different countries and competitions. 


I've heard all the arguments about how he's never been at a club long enough to promote the youth players, how there have never been youth players good enough etc. but the moment I really lost faith in him with our current youth set up was the home Champions League game against Sporting. The game meant absolutely nothing to Chelsea, they had won the group, and Mourinho paraded Loftus-Cheek to the media in the prematch press conference. It came to game time and Mourinho left Loftus-Cheek on the bench. That already disappointed me as it seemed the perfect opportunity to start him, but Mourinho went with Mikel and Matic. By the 56th minute Chelsea had a 3-1 lead, having been 2-0 up for most of the match, but still Loftus-Cheek remained on the bench until the 83rd minute when he finally replaced Fabregas. Seven minutes in a game that meant nothing to Chelsea, if he really rated and believed in Loftus-Cheek as a player that can make it at Chelsea and still only brought him on that late in the game... I just don't know. 


He's recently come out with quotes about Loftus-Cheek, about how he would be playing already were Chelsea not involved in a title race, and how he'll make an impact next season. Well, one, hopefully under Mourinho we'll be involved in a title race every single season so if he can't trust him in this one why can he trust him in the next one? And two they seem very similar to the quotes about Chalobah:

&gt; We are thinking of letting Nathaniel go on loan for a last season. That is our intention and he knows. We have discussed that with him. He is a very, very good player. I like him very much and am very impressed. For sure, he is a Chelsea player. We will see whether or not it is a Premier League club but he would have to play every weekend for the last year of his loan period. He could be in our squad already but we think one more season will help and then he will come back for 2014-15. It will be his last one out on loan. He is very, very good.


Now I know Chalobah had a disappointing season last year after a great one the year before, but still, it's 2015 and Chalobah is doing the rounds on loan. 


I'm not an unrealistic person, I don't expect the first team to be filled with homegrown English players, I don't expect Mourinho to be dropping experienced starters every game for unproven youngsters, and I understand that the odds of having multiple youth players at the ability level to compete at the top end of the Premier League and Champions League is small, but even with all that I just don't think Mourinho will do enough, or has done enough, to give our best youngsters the opportunity to shine. All the talent in the world is worthless without the opportunity to showcase it.

I'm jut gonna say it, zero hour contracts are for teenagers and students. If you are 50 years old, have 5 children a mortgage, 2 cars and a zero hour contract.. then you fucked up.

The number of functional changes that we have acquired outside of Africa in the last 100,000 years are a minute fraction compared to the amount of functional change our DNA underwent while our ancestors were still Africa.

It is quite probable that apes evolved in Africa since one of the earliest monkey to ape transitional primates was [Proconsul](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proconsul_%28primate%29) which lived in Africa between 23 and 25 million years ago.

So we would be talking about at least 25 million years of evolution in Africa, compared to a mere 100,000 years of evolution out of Africa.

null,false,Miserygut,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,null,"&gt;Why not fund the construction of social housing, real social housing not a few “affordable” rabbit hutches wedged in round the back, on brownfield sites?

I've looked into it and the main reason is that social housing didn't earn the state money (Shurely Shum Mishtake?). The establishment doesn't want to go back to 'not earning money' from it's activities, hence selling off all the public services. Anything that does earn money should be pushed out to the private sector. Practically the state is getting stripped right back to providing the minimum wherever possible and letting the market (free and regulated) do it's thing. The issue is that tax burden hasn't gone down as healthcare and other costs are increasing like all those public sector pension obligations.

The issue is that the private sector has never had any interest in developing for the sector covered by social housing - because it doesn't make any money! Housing associations step in where they can but most don't have the money or clout to get the capital required of a large project. This is why we have planning regulation to build X social housing with every development, allowing for a more balanced approach to housing, which has unfortunately been roundly ignored.

The solutions are to start cutting into BTL taxbreaks and legislation and let that pan out for a few years. There's no need to do anything super drastic on that side. London has it's own set of problems which need to be managed pragmatically, even if it does require the state to step in and say ""We need 200,000 units a year in these locations over the next 10 years"". The issue is that politicians are notoriously awful at town planning, if only there was a profession dedicated to it...

There are loads of ways to spin this. The property owner is more invested in the state of the local area because he/she has a substantial investment there. Is it fair that someone who owns multiple properties should pay council tax only on one, whereas people that own zero homes should pay council tax on someone else's?

More to the point though, I would like landlord/tenant legislation to favour tenants more, because the current state of affairs reinforces inequality by favouring those with multiple properties, and makes life much harder for first-time buyers to get onto the market.

* If your employer is providing you with life cover, this is usually worked out as a multiple of your salary. Your employer may provide less life cover if you sacrifice some of your salary.  
  
* You won't be able to receive a refund of your contributions if you leave your employment within two years of being in the scheme (a benefit many workplace schemes offer). This is because you are not directly paying contributions, so there are no contributions to be refunded.

* Your lower salary may affect the amount of money you are able to borrow for a mortgage. Mortgage lenders usually calculate how much you can borrow as a multiple of your salary, although your employer may agree to state your original salary when they supply a mortgage reference.
  
* Your entitlement to certain State benefits, such as Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP) and the State second pension (S2P) may be affected if your salary falls below the level at which you pay NICs. Your employer should be able to tell you whether or not you will be affected in this way.""

Basically it comes down to the fact that with salary sacrifice your gross salary is lower, so anything that looks at that and doesn't compensate for you being in a salary sacrifice scheme will see you as having a lower income.

I've heard that some mortgage lenders at least understand salary sacrifice and will treat you as earning the pre-sacrifice salary given suitable evidence",null,0,null,1426767728,null,0,false,0,cpjsnru,null,t3_2zkndg,null,t1_cpjsnru,null,t3_2zkndg,null,null,null,1427853099,null,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1,null

null,false,Jlowry13,,Newry. 384 1st pref votes. Baird's sausage rolls,null,"&gt;Uhm no, being anti Sinn Fein is not sectarian.  Voting for *anything* other than them clearly is though.  What you are saying is that it doesn't matter how corrupt, backwards and genuinely medieval any of the other options are, as long as it isn't Sinn Fein.

I don't think anyone is seriously saying that, least of all myself.

&gt;Like I say, you are the problem.  Most of the voters in this country are motivated by who they *don't* want in rather than who they actually *do*.  This is retarded.  It allows parties to brush over actual progressive policy and rather pander to the old hat sectarian ""us and them"" mentality.

People vote for the candidate that annoys the least people, its the ultimate democratic compromise!

&gt;The sooner people stop saying ""anyone but them"" and actually hold their representatives to some form of conviction, the better.

Why do they have to be mutually exclusive?


&gt;Edit Edit:  And yes, that goes for you too /u/Jlowry13.  I've been on your facebook page and your twitter.  It seems as though you don't seem to care much about the welfare country until there's an opportunity to attack the ""other side.""  

You've read information I've made publicly available oh no!

If you can look at my profile picture on either of those sites and conclude I have anything other than apathy for them you really haven't a clue. 

Welfare Country? Is that a typo, are you concerned that I don't care about the welfare of the country, because I'm out fairly regularly canvassing for people who I believe will make a difference.

Is it a reference to Westminster handouts? Because I did run on a local government manifesto to keep rates low and ease pressure on business to encourage growth.

Or is it about the welfare state? Because I've really little experience in this regard, and would be undue for me to give anything other than very basic opinions on how it should change.

As for attacking the other side, I think you'll find its over what they do rather than who they are.

&gt;It genuinely worries me that someone as young as yourself, having grown up in a Northern Ireland post troubles, that we probably face another generation of closed minded war painted politicians.

I've never worn war paint and I refute all allegations that I ever did. Just because I didn't experience it doesn't mean it doesn't affect me, I'm from Newry my councils official stance on unionists is ""those who murder unionists are good role models"" you think I'm close minded for trying to change that? 

&gt;I don't give a shit about UUP, DUP, SDLP or Sinn Fein.  Throw shit at eachother all you like, but what it comes down to is who will run the country better for everyone.  The answer is none of you, which is why people vote with flags and colours.  The thought process is ""I'd rather Gerry Adams slap me in the face than Peter Robinson"" or vice versa - none of you get votes because you are wanted, you get votes because the others are not.  

&gt;UUP and DUP joining for elections only reinforces this theory / fact - from a UUP point of view it is saying ""our policies are either not important or different enough from the DUP for us to even matter in these constituencies"" so ""better to have the protestants rule through in an oligarchy.""

Every party values some policies higher than others, and in these instances we are willing to say that we'd rather have someone with similar policies than some one with opposing ones, its a compromise people are always complaining we don't compromise. Let's not forget that where we have greater divergence in policies they're mostly devolved issues anyway.",null,0,null,1426767733,null,0,false,0,cpjsntv,null,t3_2zdz4d,null,t1_cpjsntv,null,t1_cpirn5d,null,null,null,1427853101,null,0,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,0,null

What I gather from the other scheme is each year I receive salary x 1/80th as pension.

It sounds like the second scheme '1/80th care' is better since I don't actually sacrifice any salary and I am just given the pension amount each year.

I think you're entirely wrong there, we're getting far better publicity from bringing through our own youth, from flourishing as a well run club in spite of the typical hardships of not being a ""top"" club and from surviving, improving, and battling at the top after our summer.  

We're becoming a world-renowned club for our academy and general progression all on our own. When Krueger talks about us being marketable I'm firmly of the opinion that he's not wrong. We've still got the plucky little underdog thing going for us, in a club that has been set up to run (hopefully) sustainably by producing our own talent, which we've been doing at an impressive rate.  

The benefits in someone like Odegaard are in the signing of a player for the future, (Madrid get their marquee signings to make a  point all the time, he's one of those but not quite like Bale/Rodriguez etc, he's more ""look, we can attract the best young talent in Europe"" as opposed to ""we can buy anyone we want""). In loaning him, all we're doing is making Madrid's prospect better, which doesn't benefit us in the long run, and in the short term, as good as he is, we could get better players for a single season (or buy) that can do better than Odegaard can.  

Lets say we had the choice of loaning Odegaard for a year (which would mean he's 17 or 18 or whatever) or buying Djuricic to play the same role? Which would you prefer?

You're literally argueing, ""well the numbers are true (because I agree with them) so my ignorant interpretation of them must also be true!"". You really don't understand what you're talking about.

 I've already explained this to you but I'll bullet point it for you so you understand, I'm saying this as someone who's worked in recruitment and as an ZHC worker before.

The demographics of those who have ZHC is vastly different from the general population. This means that even if your stupid, unreliable survey from a company with a vested interest in getting the results they got was right, you would still be a moron for using it to argue that ZHC are remotely comparable to full-time employment. Again, you'd have figured this out yourself if you knew anything about the world you've stepped into.

Reasons they aren't looking for ANOTHER job:

* They are young and/or students who've currently no need for it as even a shitty ZHC job will get them the bit of extra cash they need.
* Many are not in a situation where they could do a full time job, they have sicknesses or familial situations that prevent them  so they fall into a similar category as students as they aren't searching for full-time employment. This is another case where a ZHC ""will do"".
* They are hoping that their current ZHC will be converted into a full-time one should they prove themselves, hence why the question of them looking for ANOTHER job is fucking stupid. This is probably the main reason as the vast majority of the thousands of ZHC workers I've met/recruited/worked with are hoping this will happen. Useally because they've been lied to about it being a possibility. Recruitment is full of bullshit terminology to back up this lie. Such as describing the contract as ""ongoing"" whenever they ask about being made permanent. ""Ongoing"" really means ""you're never being made permanent unless you get lucky which hardly ever happens but if I told you that it would demoralise you and you wouldn't work like a dog for me.""

Your argument is ""well if they aren't looking for work how bad can it be!?"" because you've wandered into a field you know nothing about but assumed you do. Why can't you answer some basic questions if you're so right?

* Why do those with zero-hours contracts who aren't students/don't have other extenuating circumstances NEVER turn down a full-time contract then?
* Why aren't full-time workers asking for their contracts to be converted into ZHC? I mean, ZHC workers are so happy aren't they? Why aren't we all on one?

&gt;

&gt;A __child prodigy__ or ___Wunderkind___ is a person who, at an early age, develops one or more skills at a level far beyond the norm for their age.  A prodigy has to be a child, or at least younger than 18 years, who is performing at the level of a highly trained adult in a very demanding field of endeavour.  

&gt;The [giftedness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giftedness) of prodigies is determined by the degree of their talent relative to their ages. Examples of particularly extreme prodigies could include [Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart), [Evgeny Kissin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evgeny_Kissin) and [Teresa Milanollo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teresa_Milanollo) in music; [Bobby Fischer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Fischer), [Judit Polgár](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judit_Polg%C3%A1r), [Magnus Carlsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Carlsen), [Sergey Karjakin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Karjakin), [Paul Morphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Morphy) and [José Capablanca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Ra%C3%BAl_Capablanca) in [chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess); [Carl Friedrich Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss), [Shakuntala Devi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakuntala_Devi), [Srinivasa Ramanujan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan), [John von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann) and [Terence Tao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Tao) in mathematics; [Pablo Picasso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Picasso) and [Wang Ximeng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Ximeng) in art; and [Saul Kripke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_Kripke) in philosophy.  There is controversy as to at what age and standard to use in the definition of a prodigy. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*]

&gt;The term *Wunderkind* (from [German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language): *“wonder child”*) is sometimes used as a synonym for “prodigy”, particularly in media accounts. *Wunderkind* also is used to recognize those who achieve success and acclaim early in their adult careers.

IIRC we also tried multiple queues where we would start filling a game with high skill players and then work into the lower queues to fill up the game, which sort of works, but at that point, why not just have one queue?

It costs more to chase avoided taxes than the money earned from doing so. Besides which, people having children they can't afford isn't just about the money, it's about the attitude they have towards ensuring proper provision of the child's needs. If they are having children without being able to meet those needs, then giving them more money is little guarantee that those children will be properly nurtured and develop to fulfil their potential. It's honestly better that people who don't care about their children so much don't have children and those that do, keep more of their tax money to enable them to have more children. I know many responsible parents who would love to have more children but don't because they cannot give afford to give them the quality of life that they believe children deserve. *These* are the people that we should be encouraging to have more kids, not those on handouts with a different other parent for each of their kids.",null,0,null,1426771822,null,0,false,0,cpju8jp,null,t3_2zh569,null,t1_cpju8jp,null,t1_cpjtyfs,null,null,null,1427853835,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Do you understand what the point of a deposit is? It's so the banks know you have something to lose and can't just walk away from their debt. 

A loan for a deposit makes no sense. No banks would be willing to lend to someone with zero collateral at stake. 

Further more, a deposit shows you can be financially responsible enough to save money and be frugal if needs be. This is obviously a good sign to lenders that you're a decent horse to bet hundreds of thousands of pounds on.. 

Banks need to know that if interest rates rise, their borrower can deal with it and not just put up their hands and go 'Okay, I fucked up. I can't afford this..'

See my comments above regarding hyperbole and simply changing the facts to suit an agenda?

This is the headline: 

**""Chelsea launch amazing attack on referees for 'abnormally low' penalty count""**
&gt; Chelsea have stepped up their attacks on referees by claiming they have been awarded an ""abnormally low"" number of penalties in the Premier League this season.

Attack? Really? There was *never* an attack on referees by Chelsea Football Club or Jose Mourinho. Never. 

Then there's this in the piece by Sky:
&gt; Mourinho has been outspoken against referees all season, first suggesting in December that there was a ""campaign"" against his team.

Yes, the campaign referred to there, for which Mourinho *was* fined £25k, was for talk of a media campaign. The FA accepted for what it was and *not* an attack on referees.

When people like me who have been watching the newspapers in this country for years talk of campaigns, we're referring to the highly insidious nature of the reporting.

Care 80 is what's called a ""defined benefits"" scheme.  This means that the pension you receive at the end is defined by the rules of the scheme.  In this case for each year you contribute to the scheme you will receive a pension equal to 1/80th of your salary in that year.  That pension will be uprated each year based on inflation.

The factsheet doesn't say anything at all about if or how much you have to pay into the pension out of your salary each year to earn this benefit.

Defined benefit schemes are generally seen as a very good deal for employees.  This is because they are low risk. Short of catastrophic failure of the pension scheme you know exactly what you will get in retirement.  If investment returns from the employee contributions fall short, the company has to make up the shortfall.

The other type of scheme is ""defined contribution"" - in this case your contributions are invested for you and the amount of pension you get in retirement is determined by how well those investments have done over the intervening years.  You might do better out of a defined contribution scheme if investment returns are high, but you might also do substantially worse.",null,0,null,1426772550,null,0,false,0,cpjukgm,null,t3_2zkndg,null,t1_cpjukgm,null,t1_cpjtuqa,null,null,null,1427853991,null,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1,null

i am not a personal debt expert, but here are my two bits of advice:

1. swapping a debt for another debt isn't going to help if it makes things more expensive.  Wonga and similar companies are easy to use, but the cost they charge you is massive.  If you get on the wrong side of them (and be honest, most people can't afford to repay those type of loans) they are just as scary, maybe more so, than any of the creditors you've listed above.  they can all take you to court, but wonga's business model relies on sucking every last penny they can get from you, which is not how the council work.  

2. we (the subreddit community) can help up to a point, but you need to seek the help of professional people with experience and time to really work on this.  You have 8 balls in the air right now, and you need to find a good juggler to help you (preferably who works for free).  I suspect this is beyond CAB, but there are other charities etc who can provide the help you need.

Looks like the comment by /u/Wallace1634 that I replied to originally said exactly that.  Sooo?

&gt; People vote for the candidate that annoys the least people, its the ultimate democratic compromise!

That is utter bullshit.  You're saying when a person goes to vote, they think ""I'm going to vote for this candidate because, even though it wouldn't be my first choice, it will annoy the least people.""  Come on...

&gt; Why do they have to be mutually exclusive?

They don't, but they are.  If they weren't that would assume that candidates are held to a higher standard despite what side of the fence they appear to be.  Again, this is bullshit and only a politician would try to argue the contrary, I mean why wouldn't they.

&gt; Welfare Country? Is that a typo etc.

I see you are focused on the freudian slip I made there.  You are acting disingenuous, I think you know what I meant - welfare of the country - do you think the DUP conscience clause was an attempt at improving the welfare of the country for *all* it's people?  I think recent history can answer that for you.

&gt; I'm from Newry my councils official stance on unionists is ""those who murder unionists are good role models"" you think I'm close minded for trying to change that?

Could you provide a source for this?  Because your anecdotal claim of this is no more relevant than me saying ""that isn't true.""  I don't think you are closed minded for trying to change that, but I feel like you could do better to lead by example and I can't see any evidence that this is the case from either you or your party, and least of all the DUP.

&gt; Every party values some policies higher than others, and in these instances we are willing to say that we'd rather have someone with similar policies than some one with opposing ones, its a compromise people are always complaining we don't compromise. Let's not forget that where we have greater divergence in policies they're mostly devolved issues anyway.

I understand that.  I understand that there are policies with higher priority, but when people claim you don't compromise I don't think they are talking about compromising with only the DUP.  Again, I believe this is disingenuous.  Compromise needs to be made between opposing parties, otherwise it isn't really a compromise, is it?

Thanks for taking the time to reply, genuinely good to discuss with someone who is in the business as it were, but your reply just sounds like the same smoke that I hear from every other politician in this country.

P.S. 
&gt; You've read information I've made publicly available oh no!

Yes, I wasn't trying to unearth some secret information on you, so no need to be sarcastic.  

&gt; If you can look at my profile picture on either of those sites and conclude I have anything other than apathy for them you really haven't a clue.

I'm not sure what point you are trying to make here, or what this has to do with your profile picture, but here are some of the articles you have linked/discussed:

* Redpath urges Queen’s Students to vote against motion to ban sale of Poppies
* I was outraged at the decision by Sinn Fein &amp; SDLP to rename a playpark after IRA volunteer Raymond McCreesh. The UUP opposes any public property being named after terrorists &amp; Tom Elliott MLA is processing a Private Member’s Bill to make it illegal to do so.
* Disgusted to hear of the attacks on the Cenotaph. Newry Cenotaph commemorates volunteers from all communities and religions who fought and died, men like Michael Blaney who was awarded the George Cross for his bravery.
* More power in a united Ireland? 1 vote in 1,837,938 people sounds little bit better than a 1 vote in 6,378,000, no?

This is most of the things you've linked or discussed on your social media over the past year.  They all seem to follow a similar theme, don't you think?  I'm sure there are other important issues in Newry that don't evolve around something as inane as the naming of a playpark, regardless of what that name is.

As someone else in this thread mentioned ""Abortions for some, miniature flegs for others.""  You guys should by all means keep bringing up the same shite every year, like what roads you can march down, how often the Union Jack is flown over the city hall, whether or not we should be allowed to discriminate against homosexuals - the rest of us will try our best to move on, however difficult the politicians from any party make it.

Try as I might, the Clarkson story keeps seeping back into my world even though I have repeatedly tried to throw it in my already bulging ‘pointless celebrity gossip’ bin.

I once again wish to repeat, although I disagree with everything he has ever said he still makes me laugh sometimes and I vehemently defend his right to be casually racist, slightly homophobic, generally misogynistic and a comically cyclist baiting bully.

If you make the mistake of reading any of the recent newspaper reports about this fracas the comments below, no, don’t even look, but the comments are very divided.

There is a sizeable group that loath him, they just want him gone and are jumping at the chance to hasten his fall from grace. There is also a sizeable group that worship his every move, hate the BBC who pay for and broadcast Top Gear, hate wet liberal tossers like me and want real men to drive real cars in the real world 

These old school proper men are very angry, before anyone knows what actually took place in that hotel, they’ve all rushed to sign a bloody petition to save Clarkson.

It’s easy to see both sides in this nonsense have overreacted, but I am going to stick my limp wristed, namby-pamby, save the Polar bears lefty neck out and say the Clarksonites have overreacted more.

They want their Sunday night entertainment and some member of the ‘PC brigade’ at the BBC has spoilt it for them. They don’t care what happened, Clarkson is God, everyone else is a nanny state control freak who won’t let them say the words they all say to each other all the time, like normal blokes having a normal conversation. Normal racist slurs, normal misogynist references, normal, run of the mill homophobic banter.

I’ve been the recipient of this normal male anger many times. If I write or say something about electric cars, wind turbines, solar panels or the fact that’s it’s time we ditched the tired old internal combustion engine, I get abuse from this same, small minority. 

I’ll be accused of being a do-gooder, a lefty moron, a tree hugging pouf, a vegetarian cyclist, not a real man, an eco Nazi or most confusingly a member of the ‘PC brigade.’

What the hell is the ‘PC brigade?’ The politically correct brigade I assume.  Do you know anyone, seriously, anyone who is politically correct? I don’t. Do you know anyone who has ever used that term seriously? I don’t. If someone said ‘you are not being politically correct’ I’d call them a tosser.

But then when I think about this, I wouldn’t casually use racist terms, I wouldn’t try and belittle a man because he was gay, or a woman because she was a woman. Not because I don’t want to offend anyone but because I don’t have those feelings. I don’t think I am better than a woman, a black person, a gay person or a Muslim.

The only people who ever use the term ‘PC brigade’ are people who are desperate to shout racist, sexist or homophobic abuse in the street.

Clarksonite men cannot understand how the world has changed around them, how they are not, as they feel they should be, still the most powerful, most respected people in the world. They don’t see themselves as a minority, they see themselves as normal and everyone else is weird, foreign, female, gay or has skin the wrong colour.

But Clarksonites are a minority, if you look at global population data a very small minority who clearly feel they don’t have a voice. Hence the rise of the abhorrent UKIP.

In Clarkson’s particular case he is not a powerless member of a powerless minority, he’s very well connected. I saw him last year at Cornbury Festival having a fag with Rebekah Brooks, the ex editor of the News of the World. They are pals. I say no more.

He’s pals with our current Prime Minister. I say no more.

He has a column in the Sun newspaper where he vents his ‘world is unfair to white men who want to drive fast’ spleen. He’s very rich and powerful and having met him a couple of times, he definitely is a big and imposing figure who is clearly very used to getting his own way.

Who knows what will happen to Top Gear. For all these criticisms I’d be very sad to see it disappear. Or go on Sky because I don’t have Sky for all the obvious namby-pamby liberal reasons.

Although whilst there has never been an official 'default' the assumption would be that as NI is still legally part of the UK (regardless of anyone's personal feelings on that) if it came down to it you would be British by default. However, since that affects absolutely nothing until you want to vote or get a passport it doesn't matter in the slightest. Literally every time it would come up, be it a census or what have you, the person in question would declare themselves whatever they want and that would be accepted.

You'd have been up shit creek. For people with limited access to credit on reasonable terms, the problem is even worse, since they have little or no ability to smooth their income over three- or four-month cycles as students with holiday work often do. And, of course, because they are under no *obligation* to offer you a fixed minimum number of hours, they could have decided that they didn't like your political beliefs, or your skin colour, or the fact that you were a student; stop offering you hours, and you would have precisely zero recourse. You say you worked ""really hard while you were there"" so that they'd ""want... you"" but the point is that an employee is *paid* to do these things. A job should not be a perpetual trial period, especially not for those for whom it's their only or main source of income. 

Holiday work for students functioned perfectly well in the era before zero-hour contracts; it's pretty trivial to draw up a contract which says things like ""with prior written agreement by both parties, working hours will be reduced to zero for a fixed period specified in a separate agreement; if hours are reduced to zero for a period longer than X months at the instigation of the employer, employee shall be deemed to have been made redundant under provisions of [lots of employment law references]"" etc, or indeed to work under an oral contract (as most casual work was previously done) with implied provisions to the same effect. 

People act like employment contracts are some sort of monolithic, standardised, pick-your-choice-from-these-three thing; actually it's entirely possible to draft an appropriate contract for the sorts of work situations that people often claim zero-hours are appropriate for, while still providing minimum hours and basic employment rights. For the big corporations, this is what they have a legal team for (and for whom it will be ten minutes' work to write a draft like that) and for small businesses, UK contract law has the wonderful property that written agreements (and even oral ones) can be considered a contract, as long as all parties intended to treat it like one; agreeing with your local pub landlord ""so yeah I'll do six shifts a week in the university holidays, I'll let you know a couple of weeks in advance of when they start and finish"" and shaking hands constitutes an employment contract *with all the usual provisions intact*. 

As I said in my original post, there are some niche cases where zero-hours are appropriate, but they *really are* niche cases, and overwhelmingly they deal with people being paid enormous sums to do highly specialised work, where there's a strong incentive on both sides to treat each other well and fairly. That's not the case in ordinary work in a depressed labour market.

Lastly, I'm probably talking about my ass but as pointed out by puresrock et al. there aren't really enough players to suffice 2 or more seperate queues, but all I'm really asking is for this to be implemented.

I think that's massively putting a spin on things, Courtois is the only one we've kept and right now KDB is playing up their with the 'best', I mean we sold on Matic and then bought him back again so that was clearly an error.  its only because a Goalkeeper is so clearly able to dominate their position that we were able to see Courtois was the real thing and make him slot into our team. We haven't done this with any other prospect, from our youth or bought, we don't give them the time or the opportunity.

And no, I don't think he's an improvement on Naughton *at the moment*. For all his limits, Naughton is legitimately a Premier League player, while Yedlin at the moment would struggle to break into any top level English team. 

The difference is long-term potential and playing style. Pochettino clearly favors fullbacks who attack as well as defend, and who can provide width up the field in attack. Naughton could put in a long pass with decent ability--even in his poorer games, he almost always had a few nice long pings--and he wasn't a terrible crosser, but he was so rarely inclined to get involved in the attack that he's unsuited to what Pochettino is trying to do. Plus, he is as good as he'll ever be, though perhaps not what people saw as his ceiling when he first broke into the league. Yedlin offers both the attacking fullback play as well as long-term growth potential. He may be 21, so that's a little old for a prospect, but he could in two or maybe three years' time be challenging for a starting role in a Pochettino system. 

Don't expect to see him anytime soon, though. He'll likely play out his u21 eligibility before he gets close to the first team.",null,0,null,1426775721,null,0,false,0,cpjw630,null,t3_2zknyu,null,t1_cpjw630,null,t1_cpjvdbm,null,null,null,1427854737,null,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5,null

Iain Duncan Smith, said: “I am delighted that the country’s highest court has agreed with this government and overwhelming public opinion that the benefit cap is right and fair.""  

So he scrapes thru this, and then believes that proves him undeniably right and that he should be proud of what he's done to this country?  Time and time again, he proves that simple facts cannot penetrate his skull, continuing to just happily go along with the beliefs that are repeated by the voices in his head.

No. That would be a crazy way to do it.

There should be a defined percentage contribution required to buy a year in Care 80.  The factsheet you linked doesn't mention it so I don't know what it is.

On the window of every train station in the West Midlands is a notice saying that off-peak fares and season tickets are valid on trains leaving Birmingham New Street Station up to 4:35pm. The usual cutoff time is 3:30.

When I noticed the signs going up, I checked the London Midland website, just to be on the safe side, and the T's &amp; C's reiterated what was on the notice.

So a few days later, I'm travelling on a train out of New Street at 4pm with my offpeak travel card. Along comes Mr Jobsworth and tells me I've broken the law and issues a fine. I tell him what the notice says (remember, this is the notice that's on every kiosk window at every station in the West Midlands) and he calls it as bullshit, phones London Midland helpline and *they agree with him*!

The court paperwork comes through and I write out my side of the story, including a handwritten link to the T's &amp; C's which state I was actually travelling with a valid ticket. 

I hear nothing more. Not a dicky bird. I presume the fine was quashed and the case thrown out. Either that, or there's a quiet little warrant out for my arrest or something.

About a month after that, my SO gets caught for exactly the same thing. We write the same defense, again, nothing heard since. This was maybe a year, 18 months ago.

It all depends on why you want a financial advisor. A financial advisor can advise you on where best to put the money you have saved, but if you don't have any savings, there seems little point in doing so.

null,false,DeadOptimist,null,null,null,"Well, I can make an opinion based on my thoughts, but I cannot say or point to anything for sure. I do know the whole system is fucked (not fully, just has a lot of stupid stuff in it) for both parties. I'll give some examples from what I have experienced and what others have told me.

A lot of cleaning companies are newly created with an intention of winning a few big-ish contracts. They generally pay their employees a low amount and often are horribly late in payment even then. They fold (go bankrupt) relatively often and when cleaners try and sue for compensation they get an award but no money, as the company has none (it has all been funnelled somewhere else and like hell do the victims have money to pursue £750). This award would, as of the new rules from last year, include recuperation of the costs of bringing the claim. That of course does them no good as the company has nothing anyway. Therefore even when someone has all the rights in the world to justly claim, they are stopped because it will leave them out of pocket even with a win.

On the other side, in employment tribunals you can represent yourself meaning before the application fee it only cost you your time (and if you have been fired you have a lot of that). You would get employees making the stupidest claims imaginable and the tribunal will often treat them kindly as they are lay-people and so cannot be expected to be perfect in practice. However, because of their risk the employer would usually hire a lawyer or barrister (because if they lose it can open the doors to many other claims that are just as poor) and this would eat up a fair bit of money as the system was really full (before the fees) meaning everything was slow and appeals etc. would drag it out for even longer. Thus you had a lot of ""settlements"" (I use "" "" as it's more of a pay off than settling) which just encouraged others to claim for stupid stuff.

So it is kind of a hard balance. The fees make it harder for the poor to pursue shit employers (but it already was rather hard), while the lack of fees encouraged spamming of BS claims in the hopes that an employer would find settlement cheaper.

I’ll give a quick example of a BS claim so you get an idea what I mean. I had to handle a case where an employee was made redundant. 2 departments were combined, they went from 10 jobs to around 6, and she was not one of the people who retained her position (she was let go as she had the lowest documented productivity of both departments). She claimed race discrimination (she was black). We pointed out that 5 of the 6 people remaining were black. She said most of these were new hires, who we hired in an attempt to cover up the fact that we fired black people due to racism. So, to hide our discrimination of black people we hired more black people… You might laugh, but that claim cost her nothing to put through but took about a year to get through the system (it was put in before the fees came) and a lot of man-hours. If the council lost it would have been all over the newspapers (“COUNCIL FOUND GUILTY IN RACE CLAIM”) and then every single person who wants to file a race claim will point to that case and say “look, this is their normal behaviour” and it would take even longer trying to go through those. 

This is probably a little less prevalent motivation-wise in the private sector though, as publicity of this nature is not as common. However, the man-hours needed to see a case to completion are probably a much bigger factor as for private firms as they are not necessarily looking at “fairness and equality” but rather profitability and so their legal department (or external hires) need to actually be worth the money – not seek “justice”.

Playing defensively and trying to scrape your way by isnt even good enough to win 1 champions league title let alone multiple titles. 2012 was something very very special dont bring it up as a precedent and inspiration.

The Premier League is about endurance and you can play tactically in that by going for the draw when its most beneficial for you.  Champions league, not a chance and the further you go in the tournament the more the depth of your football is tested. if you dont have a solid foundation of attack then you wont win the CL, if you play to scrape by like we do then you are bound to lose to top opposition in the end. We might have scraped past PSG but when it would come to playing the likes of Real Madrid, Barca or Bayern we would get our ass handed to us you cant expect to beat those teams by playing like pussies and hoping for luck.

I'm honestly quite convinced that London hype is just that. Hype. And yes, I think it's mostly populated by people who think there's no jobs elsewhere because they grew up in an area without jobs..

null,false,JimmothyTwinkletoes,null,null,null,"Throw in Lacazette and put Dzeko in the ""Out"" section. I could see Dzeko going back to the Bundesliga this summer. Also, with the way Lopes is playing for Lille, I would like to see him in the rotation. De Brunye would be too expensive for a sub. With the year he is having, and having been bought for 22m just a year ago, I think it would cost us over €30m to get him over here. I would rather us not spend that money. 

Lucas would be really expensive too but he is a badass and imo could be a Bale/Reus level player. We need more direct wingers who arent afraid to cut inside and take shots. We also need more players who will make runs in the box. Since Agüero has come back it seems like no one is wanting to make runs in, aside from Bony. Instead we have a bunch of people standing around looking to pass to Agüero. Sterling wouldn't be worth the extra cost of buying from a English squad rival. He is a great player but I dont think he is worth more than £30m and I can't imagine Liverpool selling him for less than £50m. 

Also, forget Vertonghen. Demichelis just signed a new deal. He and Mangala will rotate in the XI next to Kompany. That's good enough for me. I dont fault or CBs for most of the goals given up, more of the way we play and the fact that we dont have a true DM who can fill in for them, forcing them to rush forward to defend counters leaving us vulnerable. Fernando should play that role but when he is on Yaya doesn't seem as willing to push forward as with Fernandinho next to him, and we all know that Yaya isn't the man for that role. Dinho did well last season.

Finally, Pellegrini should stay unless we fall out of the top-4, regardless of Klopp, Guardiola, Simeone, or Ancelotti.

I watch a decent amount of PSG and Verratti is one of the most enjoyable players to watch. He bites at ankles (always gets a yellow card, which is a bit frightening), makes Iniesta-like passes, can slide tackle like Ledley's on Robben, and dribbles like a fancy Modric. 

I know that we can't expect Mason to live up to Verratti. But it seems the only things Mason is a bit better than average at are his energy and he can pass decently (I'm less taken with his passing ability than most on here). It's great to have a player who can disrupt midfields and Mason's good at the high press. 

But watch what he does when he gets the ball. If there's any pressure at all, he does a half spin, and makes a 8 yard pass to Bentaleb, a winger, or back to CBs. It's only when, like the assist for Kane &amp; Chadli's 2 v. 1, he has time that he can pick out a pass. 

I think we can agree that Bentaleb is more effective at either finding people or creating chances with his passes. 

It leaves me wondering what is Mason's special thing? It's just his energy. And while I'm happy we have it, a player needs more than that to have a solid starting spot.

yes, i am all in favor of that. if we can turn him into 2-4 very good players, we should. thats why its important to get him signed. especially when we have similar players on the roster - its not impossible to replicate what he does, which is all the more reason to make sure hes sold for a huge amount.

&gt;No one's bigger than the club.

that is easier to swallow when glen johnson is making 110k/week or whatever. its not about being bigger than the club - its about getting paid in line with one's value to the team and club. is raheem worth hazard/neymar wages today? absolutely not. is it really that absurd to think he might be worth that in 2-3 years? i dont think so.

as a 19/20 year old, in the french league, hazard had 7 goals and 11 assists.

as a 19/20 year old, in the dutch league, suarez had 10 goals in 6 assists.

as a 19/20 year old, in the english premier league, sterling had 9 goals and 7 assists.

we won the champions league the year before. thank god we did because he is our future, if we win the league this year and if our reputation precedes us then I could see the possibility of him coming but the fact of the matter is that all the big clubs have interest in Pogba. to the best of my knowledge he signed a new contract very recently with Juventus hes not going to leave until one of those giants come calling. Even if he was available this summer would we not be competing with RM or Bayern? I could see him just wait one year for them to be able to buy rather than jump the gun.... if he really wants Chelsea then he will join us but he wont come to us as a thing he considered and acted upon. He wont be persuaded into joining Chelsea when every top club in Europe has interest in him and he knows it. coming to us in the summer before those teams can even approach him could be a big waste in his eyes.

The Idea that there is a large homogenous genetic group on these Islands stretching back to the Ice age is disproved entirely by this study. However his argument was already flawed and on shaky ground anyway.
 
&gt; **The idea of Paleolithic genetic continuity has been demolished recently**, as I detail in Migrationism Strikes Back. Most of the mtDNA haplogroups, thought by scientists to have been in Europe since the Paleolithic, were absent when actual Paleolithic DNA was tested. Genetic continuity must be proven directly, and inferences from modern populations are suspect.
&gt; 
&gt; Oppenheimer bases his inferences on age calculations based on Y-chromosome STRs on modern populations, using an extreme evolutionary mutation rate that overestimates time depth by almost an order of magnitude, and leads to even more extreme time overestimates than the evoluationary rate that I criticized recently.
&gt; 
&gt; I had been positively inclined towards Oppenheimer's work, and I still consider it superior to other popularizing efforts, because of its data richness and clear effort to synthesize different strands of knowledge. **In retrospect, however, it is flawed, as it is based on faulty mutation rates and faulty interpretation:**
&gt; 
&gt; Oppenheimer's argument is a special case of what Francois Balloux described recently, and Guido Barbujani a long time ago. To make a long story short, it doesn't matter if a certain haplogroup found in Britons is 1,000 or 10,000 years old. Knowing this fact tells us nothing about when the patrilineage arrived in Britain: a 1,000-year old haplogroup may have developed from a British line of ancestors that were reduced to a single man 1,000 years ago, and a 10,000-year old haplogroup may have arrived in Britain only 10 years ago by a group of distantly related immigrants.


This new study Points out that there is **no standard or unified** 'Celtic' Gene rather variations of 'Celtic' genes related to Geography, the Clumsy Headline *""DNA study shows Celts are not a unique genetic group""* Makes no sense in this regard, the Accompanying video does a better job of explaining the findings.
[As the preamble  from the study explains](http://www.nature.com/articles/nature14230.epdf?referrer_access_token=o1E6-srZQjqaQsnoTcbL3tRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0MiE0_B2kFTYAb64eH_EPxJeiJzg7Mfl6MEBC6p_EUzUhn20X4WGsMhORPh_wQWF0XWfuvis22UqrLNVuhlijqXTxOXx-26amOZUjUE9AICb_6Nw0oQxV-xs8GMPjlYpJz-j8nyHTNCl1s3QB_7eME2&amp;tracking_referrer=www.bbc.co.uk)

&gt; We suggest significant pre-Roman but post-Mesolithic movement into southeastern England from continental Europe, and show that in non-Saxon parts of the United Kingdom, there exist genetically differentiated subgroups rather than a general ‘Celtic’ population.
