You put money in the ISA, and then use those funds to buy shares, funds, ETFs, and all sorts.  All of these can obviously go up or down.

There's loads of research out there about how best to put your money into this sort of thing, and actually it seems to point towards that in most cases you're usually best off putting it all in right away, earlier the better, as time in the market beats timing the market.

Some people if they feel that prices are a bit high and/or there's a dip coming or whatever, like to spread their investment out over time so as not to accidentally buy in at a high point.  I personally feel this is more of a psychological benefit than anything, as really, the kinds of things you should be putting in a S&amp;S ISA are long term investments, think 10 years or more, and the gains over that sort of timescale should outweigh short term opportunity costs of buying high etc.

A few examples - My father, god bless him, suffers from terrible social anxiety, depression an aspergers. Just popping down to the local shop is something he has to 'work' his way up to doing. He doesn't work so has little money etc and at that time he unfortunately didn't have a bank card. One time years ago, he was travelling from home to somewhere else in the country to visit family, he fell asleep and ended 150 miles away from his destination at the last station that train was visiting. He was obviously pretty worried (as we'd all be!) and worked him self into a state about it. My dad explained to the conductor that he'd simply messed up and what would be the best solution, he had full intention of paying to correct his mistake, but the conductor walked him to the office on the platform and the conductor/other staff helped him out, let him phone us to explain, gave him some change for a meal deal, got him free tickets on the next train to the correct destination and even bloody well had him in first class! I know my dad and by extension my mother and I really appreciated the help, it was really touching that they gave him some change for something to eat!

Another time I was waiting at Manchester airport, wanting to go 3 stops away. My train didn't arrive, I had to be somewhere, so I got on the next one, as a result my tickets were invalid. I explained this to the conductor, who was actually aware the previous train never came, I was more than happy to pay the couple of quid to get to my destination but the conductor was really bloody rude and said my tickets were worthless (which was technically correct) and harshly reprimanded me for even bringing up the fact I had these tickets.

Couldn't distinguish Welsh place names. The subtitles miss out words, like Aberystwyth. THAT'S WHERE THE FUCKING SERIES IS SET. They are going to ""Parc Y Boda"", which is a place mentioned several times. They aren't going to ""Park a boat"", which would make no fucking sense in the context. 

Couldn't distinguish Welsh first names. It's not Annette, it's Enid. Enid is not her brother, Aneurin. 

Can't understand the Welsh accent. Spoiler: They are going to build 70 turbines. That was said clearly. You can't just subtitle [INAUDIBLE] and expect someone to be able to follow the plot. 

If you're going to subtitle a program, it's important you can understand what's being said.

You set the second router up like this:

So whatever you do on the second router only effects what's plugged into it, or connected wireless to the second router's wifi. It makes no difference to anything else.

You can set it up using an N150R from Ebuyer (about £7) and putting OpenWRT on it (free). You then use [AdFreeTime](https://adfreetime.com/a/454) or whatever on the second router, and it works automagically on anything you connect to that router.

There are so many news stories that British media could choose as a main story. Greek economy is probably more important to your life right now. Leave personal tragedies to the families involved.

It's a bit like the story of the girl in Australia who had a bomb on her and was being held for ransom. That's in Australia and was headline news here.

""Dozens of families being murdered on the beach and beside pools is going to have emotional connotations whether you like it or not.""

The extent of emotional connotation changes when articles and headlines are written differently.

You can't combat attacks like this in other countries. Or at least, it's difficult. In this country you combat it with education and not over hyping, or over-sexing the news with words like Gunman, Massacre, Death-toll, Terrorist, Fire-fight etc. Those sort of words put ideas into peoples minds.

All the years when I've done things like mandatory 'voluntary' work for 13 weeks, been on Work Programme, New Deal etc... none of that helped. What helped was having someone looking out for the work I wanted as opposed to 'just anything', patiently waiting as I gained the qualifications to get the work I wanted, and supporting me through the jobsearching process.

I'm giving credit for success, not blaming people for woes. The only blaming I'm doing is towards a system where this kind of understanding, dignity and support is such a rare find. Us taxpayers provide the infinite sinkhole of funding that keeps these agencies running, so I find it to be a reasonable expectation that they should work.

People should be able to re-train through the jobcentre, and secure the funding for that far more efficiently and promptly than they currently can. Also, there needs to be more of a drive towards personal support at the jobcentres rather than merely a 'sign here for your benefit' situation that they now have. They check that you've been tirelessly hunting for literally anything, and then have you sign for payment. No. Support. Whatsoever. If you want real support, you have to go to different agencies, and those are usually just a matter of being seated in front of a computer for 3 hours a week and ignored while you play solitaire and gaze out the window.

Not that anyone to my knowledge has been fined, or jailed simply for drawing a picture of Mohammed. All the trouble I've seen has come from images of him being drawn in a satirical/offensive manner, depending on your stance on the issue. Now, even 50 years ago (maybe less, I'm not that old and only going by what older friends/relatives have told me and a bit of looking around online), owning a golliwog toy would have been normal as anything, and wouldn't even have been seen as racist by the kids who owned them. Would someone who was black have seen them as harmless toys? I'd assume not, especially if they had ever been called a wog. To most people, including a decent amount of the Muslims I know, an image of Mohammed isn't an issue in itself (though very few of the Muslims I know were okay with it being used as it was in the Danish cartoon). But to some, it is very offensive. I think it would be wrong to ignore that, as we'd further disrupt our society and prevent cohesion and integration. A blanket ban would be too far in my eyes as well. But if an image is clearly made with the knowledge it will cause offense, and with that purpose - especially on religious, racial, sexual etc grounds - then there should be legal measures against it.

Yes, immigrants have been coming to Britain for centuries, but the scale of immigration that we've seen over the last half century hasn't really been seen since arrival of the Anglo-Saxons.

But that's were my agreement with him ends. He didn't really counter the point about migrants filling skills shortages very well. Fact is we don't have enough engineers, doctors and nurses- we should be patching our education system so that we can fill skills gaps domestically but until we can we have to bring in foreign talent as a short term solution- Otherwise we'd have major problems, especially in the NHS.

His point about the loss of British values and identity from immigration is a really interesting one but not one I entirely agree with. How can we be sure that this confusion we have about the British identity is specifically caused by immigration and not due to other things like globalisation, changing ideas and devolution? 

Another point about migration and especially when statistics are bought up is that what sort of migrants are we talking about and what ones do we want? Do any given migration figures include international students? What about people coming in on a short term working visa? What about those coming in on a spouse visa because they've married a British citizen? I think its important to be critical of these sort of statistics, and also consider what sort of immigrants we want and don't want.

British biologist Sir Tim Hunt was forced to resign from his post at University College London (UCL) without being given a chance to explain his controversial remarks about women in science.

Hunt was then sacked from his post on the European Research Council’s science committee.

I'm in the hamster wheel, no doubt, but I'm being paid the most money I've ever been paid, doing the longest hours I've ever had..... but I feel like I'm doing less actual work than when I was on benefits. Makes me glad I realised way back that I'd never be able to get along with retail work stacking shelves. I can actually do this job without feeling like clawing my face off ten minutes into my shift.

I say 'feels like I do less work' because technically I'm doing plenty. Getting loads of stuff done, addressing issues, keeping an eye on things. I'm actually pretty important, and not just the living, breathing paperweight I tend to liken my job title to, but the fact remains that I'm far less stressed out as a security concierge than I was as a jobseeker. Far better paid than I was when I was on my feet for 8 hours rushing around, and far more respected than I was when I was replenishing stock and feeling suicidal from all the endless interaction with customers. It's ironic that the customers I deal with now are druggies, miscreants and other kinds of society's rejects, but yet they treat me with far more civility and respect than I ever knew from the customers of the days doing mandatory volunteering with M&amp;S.

I think at least a small part of that is down to them perhaps somehow knowing that there's barely a cigarette paper between me a few years ago and them now. I was homeless once. I haven't been a druggie, but some of the stuff I've had to deal with in life makes that fact more of an oddity than a mere data point. I've been on benefits, on and off, since I was a teenager. The biggest difference is that I've kept my nose clean, while the majority of the people I keep an eye on have had plenty of tangles with the law. So perhaps they respect me because my experience resonates with theirs, but no...

Other than that he did make some good points but he never really explained why immigration is bad, here's why it's good: it does provide a net bonus and it gets people out of shitty situations into a stable country, yes I don't think we should let people stuck in Calais simply because they prefer to be in the UK, they should set up their lives in the first stable country they can unless they have family in a country they can easily get into.

I have experienced the two extremes - a state secondary school that is pretty horrendous and a state sixth form college that is somewhere around the top 10% - and yes, the overall quality of the learning environment absolutely impacts the grades one will go on to earn. 

However, one's career success often hinges on a whole host of other factors such as personability, self-confidence, grit/determination, team cohesion... My concern with findings such as this is that it will only further encourage the bad schools to become C grade factories (as my secondary school was), rather than place an emphasis on the individual's development of overall social capital (as my college did). 

The latter is only achievable with adequate resources, so it is the responsibility of the government to properly fund state schools, but it is also the responsibility of governors/heads to place an emphasis not on grade grinding but on valuing the individual.

There really is absolutely no reason to want him, like none. They guy is washed up, post-injury, and has already played like shit for another PL team. Add in the fact that he is demanding ludicrous wages, and its probably the biggest joke of a transfer I can imagine. We don't need him.

Starting with Chelsea since they're the most recent title winners.

**Steve Holland**: Was an academy coach of the fearsome Crewe Alexandra before going on to be their senior manager for *two whole years* then moving on to bigger and better things like Stoke's academy coach and manager of Chelsea's U-21s.

Next we have City.

**Brian Kidd**: He was manager of Preston North End for a whole two months before moving on to Man U's youth team.  After three years he served as Sir Alex's assistant... then moved on to manage Blackburn for less than a season and going on to have a string of assistant roles with Portsmouth, Leeds, Sheffield United and the English national team before finding his way to where he is today.  Key here is the fact that he basically did nothing before landing his place with United before serving there for *seven* years.

Now we have Arsenal.

**Steve Bould**: Slotted in immediately with Arsenal as a youth coach before being promoted after 3 years.

And finally to round out the top 4, Man U.

**Ryan Giggs**: Retires and immediately gets the job after a short stint as player-manager.

Now, most if not all of these men are former players, so you can't just say ""of course Giggs could just slot in... he was a brilliant player.""  I don't think I have to prove that not every good player makes a great manager or coach.  It took 5 months for Seedorf to get sacked at Milan (you can argue about whether it was fair or not on your own time).  I won't even get into what Pako and Rene had done before making their mark with us and United respectively (I'll give you a hint - very little).

If it's marketed as a premium/luxury club app, and that's the charge then that's also easily disputed since Madrid, Barca and Munich for example (along with Inter, Ajax, PSG and more) all don't charge.

However this is Reddit - and subs act like hives - this sub is no different and has a hive mentality. It follows one general consensus on topics - anything else is harshly down voted. There are exceptions to every rule and this is no different - with correct evidence and reasoning you can usually swing people to seeing your viewpoint but that's rare.

If you say something out of touch like you did, you'll generally get down voted. If someone gets slightly down voted to a -1 -2, it will dramatically swoop down.

If you flick through my comment history you'll often see me writing on peoples unfairly down voted comments 'I don't get why this is being downvoted' then I usually logically explain why I think that and later their comment gets more upvotes. That's how you you fight the hive - you gotta speak up and point the obvious out to people. Otherwise for some reason people seem to follow his hive mentally.

Even if I disagree with someone point - why down vote? It will get buried. If anything vote it up as it makes debate. Down voted Down votes Downvotes should be for those who attack people for sharing a different view (there's so much hate on this sub, too. Despite the fact we all have something in common!)

Dzeko has never been played in a 'deeper role' in his time at City, he's always been a forward. The positions our forwards take aren't rigid and restrictive, they're usually quite fluid, so the forwards often have the freedom to roam where they want, within reason.

Dzeko has always been a player who likes to get touches of the ball, come short and occasionally go down the channels. He doesn't do it as often as smaller more mobile forwards, but he's always done it. He's not great in congested spaces, and he likes to get touches of the ball.

He's never been the caricature target man number 9, ever.

His hold up play isn't good enough for a start. His touch under pressure with his back to goal is poor. He's not aggressive and strong enough, he's not great under pressure when he has the ball.

Negredo, during his hot streak, was a complete number 9. A very good target man and a goal scorer. He had great strength, balance, and could hold the ball up well under pressure. He was aggressive and used to give centre halves great trouble physically. His touch was great as well, and coupled with his strength, and awareness, he was fantastic at holding up the ball and bringing others into play. It's one of the reasons he was such a brilliant partner for Aguero.

Dzeko has never, ever, been that player.

Dzeko is more of a goal poacher, and on form, a finisher. He keeps the ball ticking over when he gets it to feet, spreading it out wide usually, but he contributes little in build up play or as a target man. He's capable of doing a bit, but they're certainly not his strengths.

He should do reasonably well in Italy, but he's never been ideally suited to our style of play, under Mancini or Pellegrini.

null,false,ohgodimonfire,null,null,null,"&gt;I have experience in restaurant and kitchen work, retail and customer service, I'm just looking for an entry-level part-time position.

I'm sorry to add to your stress but as you're probably already painfully aware, there's a huge amount of people in that position and it may get even harder when the Autumn influx of students happens. 

Firstly, you can always get a soul crushing job in a call-center. If you're desperate you can talk to recruitment agencies like Classic Consulting, Red Flag Recruitment, Alpha Staff, Manpower, CIP etc. They will nearly always be able to find you some work, but it won't be pleasant.

Secondly, you should do 'the walk' through town looking at every viable business. 99.95% of the time if you just go in and hand in a CV it'll be refused or binned instantly. The point is that you build a list of say 100 viable places so you can check their website daily or at least weekly for openings. 

Sometimes you can also get useful information from employees. For instance if you go in and say ""Hi, sorry to bother you, but do you know if 'Shop XYZ' is hiring at the moment?"", they'll probably say ""I'm not sure, check the website"" but possibly also ""I think when Dave leaves next week there'll be a stock-room job going"". So you can sometimes get a clue of when to check and what the company is looking for. 

Thirdly you want to be skimming through job ads on Gumtree, Reed, Monster, TotalJobs, Brightonandhovejobs, etc. You're looking for the holy grail: an entry level job that doesn't require extensive experience and qualifications. It is, however, sometimes possible to get cushty little admin jobs and especially with E-commerce businesses.

null,false,parzx,lfc68,,null,"Honestly despite Stevie being my favorite player I think that for the large part of the past 2 or 3 years the team has looked better without him. They seem to play with less pressure and don't always look to pass him the ball when feeling stressed or when they're down, expecting him to hit some amazing long ball to the strikers or blast the ball in from 40 yards. Yes he got a superb goals/assist tally the season before last but the majority of his goals were penalties and of course you'd chalk up the assists passing to Suarez and Studge. You could play a 5-yard pass to Suarez in midfield and he could then lob the keeper from the halfway line and it would count as an assist.

I feel that Rodgers playing him in a defensive role really hurt the team as he was not mobile enough, nor good enough defensively. People attribute the massive numbers in our goals conceded columns to the failures of the CBs but as I posted in another thread a link to a video of Gerrard initially marking Ronaldo, following the ball and not the man, and letting Ronaldo gallop through a gap between the CBs and score easily. It was not Kolo Toure or Skrtel's fault, it was Stevie's for not marking Ronaldo.

If Rodgers does indeed decide to not buy a proper DM, then I'll be praying that Lucas stays fit because we really need someone to sit in front of the back 4, shield them at all times and make tackles and interceptions in midfield rather than having the CBs have to do it. If Rodgers does the smart thing and plays Lucas behind Milner and Hendo we'd have a very mobile, energetic trio where Hendo and Hamez Milninho can press the opponents and Lucas can sit back and defend, making for quite a competent defensive midfield which would definitely make life easier for Sakho and Skrtel. If, however, Rodgers decided to play a ""high pressure"" system with Allen, Hendo and Milner with any of them as a ""holding midfielder"" then we're fucked. 

TL;DR I think the team will play better without Stevie as long as Rodgers deploys a proper defensive midfielder ",null,0,null,1435627992,null,0,false,0,csn2gvj,null,t3_3bkmev,null,t1_csn2gvj,null,t3_3bkmev,null,null,null,1437452852,null,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5,null

Meanwhile, in a parallel universe:

TIM: Omigosh we're in trouble! That asteroid is heading straight for Gotham City!

BRUCE: Don't worry. I've got about half a dozen people for this. -opens bat-phone, dials a number, waits while phone rings-

KAL-EL: Hey Bruce!

BRUCE: Clark.

KAL-EL: Is this about the asteroid? Because I'm headed straight for it already; the Doctor's helping me out.

BRUCE: That's what I thought. Robin was getting a little nervous, so I thought I'd double check.

KAL-EL: Tell him not to worry, this won't take twenty minutes with both of us on it.

BRUCE: Tell the Doctor I said hi.

KAL-EL: Sure thing! Say hi to Robin and Nightwing for me.

-click-

BRUCE: -looks pointedly at TIM- See? It's *fine*.

TIM: You're really okay with Superman and the Doctor taking out the asteroid for you?

BRUCE: Why not? Space is a little out of my skill set, and they've both saved the world more times than I have, even if they wouldn't know how to handle Gotham like I do. And if Superman or the Doctor weren't available, I'd have called Green Lantern, J'onn J'onzz, Captain Atom, Captain Marvel, Wonder Woman-

TIM: Alright already! I get the point. Well, I guess if the asteroid is covered, then there's nothing to do tonight. -leans back in his bat-chair-

BRUCE: *Robin*, it's Gotham City. Crime doesn't take nights off, and neither do we.

Maybe so. But you cannot say to people 'Society has influenced you so I will challenge your life choices'. They may have been influenced, but in the end they are still individuals with their own brains capable of making their own rational decisions.

And like I said, there is no evidence that they *are* being significantly influenced in one direction or another throughout the entire education system on a national basis.

&gt; I don't think it is odd to look for things which might be wrong when divergences occur

I agree, but you haven't established that there is anything wrong yet. You see that the genders are disproportionate, but there is nothing wrong if they have legitimately chosen those paths for themselves. Unless you can demonstrate that women are being unfairly driven away from the STEM subjects, you cannot claim that there is a problem.

I agree with gender equality, but I also accept that males and females are still different: they have different physiologies, different emotional strengths/weaknesses, different emphasis on cognitive functions etc. It is not hard to see how men and women might be interested in different subjects.

He won the case but ended up amounting serious debt so he was penalized anyway which is ridiculous, hence the need for reform (particularly financial payouts and court costs involved in libel, they are excessive and severely impact freedom of speech as a result). Scientology itself is notorious for abusing libel laws to attack people who speak negatively about the religion. The substantial harm criteria in the 2013 Act would help to combat this problem. Except the politicians in Northern Ireland has explicitly disliked that provision and it has been labelled as the major reason to not extend the 2013 Act to Northern Ireland.

I agree but our education system doesn't move particularly fast.  It'll take 5 - 10 years to push these subjects at the school level on up... at which point there probably won't be a skills shortage any more.  It will continue to pump out people with these skill sets for a decade more at least.

When I was at school in the mid-90's there was a skills shortage in various facets of the IT sector but most schools were still in a typing pool &amp; secretarial duties mentality of the decades prior.

Exactly ! It's like one loss after the other. And I think that's why the show is so great.  I feel exactly how the characters feel, I think. When Nine regenerated, I knew Ten would be awesome, but still it made me sad. And I kept watching of course, liking him more and more. I think that's how Rose felt.

And after that, I ""moved on"" but sometimes, I'd think of her and it would make me instantly sad again. I force myself not to cry and try to forget. And I think that's exactly how the Doctor feels. I could go on for a while but I think you get it.

* You can make the journey without changing trains

* Trains taking a valid route in the National Routeing Guide. (Which has a whole new host of conditions).

* You aren't travelling the shortest distance
* Reading to London has it's own routes set in the routeing guide. Which you can see [here](http://data.atoc.org/routeing-maps) - RG or WX from the drop down list.

In summary, no you can't do that route.

However you can use the [National Rail Journey Planner](http://ojp.nationalrail.co.uk/service/planjourney/search), and add ""travel via"" and see what the result is. If you hit ""journey details"" it will say you need to buy more than 1 ticket.

null,false,jt21295,num1,,null,"Kinda just echoing what has already been said, but this would be a disastrous move.  At least Soldado was scoring when we bought him.  Llorente was pretty shit ([9 goals in 40 apps](http://www.whoscored.com/Players/13361/)) for a team boasting quite the creative midfield (Tevez scored [29 in 49](http://www.whoscored.com/Players/14167/) and Morata scored [15 in 41](http://www.whoscored.com/Players/91213/)).

He plays like your typical target man - lots of lay-offs, headed goals, etc.  Kane can play like that already, so he offers nothing new in that respect.  In addition, Kane is nearly a decade younger, much more prolific, and offers more as far as holding onto the ball and creating opportunities for his teammates.  

This would be a terrible purchase, and its relieving to see /u/dirtyewok's (great username btw) post point to this probably being a heaping mound of cow shit.  

Unfortunately, no matter what striker we pick up to backup Kane, we're going to be taking a solid risk this year.  The safest option left is probably Charlie Austin (scored a good amount in the PL with a fairly dire team behind him, not a ridiculous transfer fee).  I'm not sure there's much merit in bringing in another young striker for €15million+ when we already have a definitive, young starting forward in Kane.

Long answer **Yes.**

Two: How will this affect atomosphere?

That is the true question of this stadium. We've seen bowls at the Etihad and Emirates, and the atmospheres there can be, at best, pathetic. 60,000 ""fans"" would sound about as passionate as a group of grapefruit enthusiasts at best. The *4-corner* approach has been more successful (Westfalenstadion especially). In the end, if the improved stadium has the feel of the MHL, I don't think there will be any issues. Hopefully, there will be at least two sides to the fortress for the youth/loud-and-passionate supporters who cram the MHL and Shed ends. If we are 40,000 strong in those ends, we will be quite the boisterous bunch Chelsea should be.

Dzeko holds the Bundesliga record for the most scoring duo of all time. When Bosnia played 4-4-2 guess who was consistently the most scoring duo in Euro zone qualifiers? Are you saying Dzeko can't form a scoring partnership? Because clearly he seems to be pretty damn good at it.

Also fuck off with the generalization. I clearly stated independent expert point of view on the same thing:

&gt; The relationship between City’s strikers has always been slightly confusing, even in the Roberto Mancini days. Edin Dzeko and Sergio Aguero is a slightly uneasy partnership, because it’s never entirely certain what Aguero’s role in the side is. Clearly a hugely talented individual, sometimes you wonder whether he’s happier playing just behind a main striker, or playing higher up and sprinting in behind. When he manages to combine the two roles in the same performance he can be unstoppable, but when things are going against his side, **he can cause tactical problems.**

You're saying he's excellent. But unproven in the system that we seem to play with through balls and creative players behind and less reliance on crosses? 

Here's another striker looking solid:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVrr2-xbZWs

We already have our own Beneteke. 

What does he do different in all those clips that Balotelli doesnt? Where did Balotelli fail when he came to Liverpool? 

**Balotelli -** 

Strength - check

Wicked shot - check

Ability to shoot from angles - check

Heading ability - check

Threat from set pieces - limited

Passing ability - limited

Running at defences - no (translating to laziness) 

Running in behind defences translating to pace ala Sturridge, Sterling or Suarez - no (This has given us one of our most successful seasons in the last decade or so)


**Benteke-** 

Strength - check

Wicked shot - check

Ability to shoot from angles - check

Heading ability - check

Threat from set pieces - check

Passing ability - limited, but better than our current strikers, and not expected to possess this in an advanced level anyway. 

Running at defences - check

Running in behind defences translating to pace ala Sturridge, Sterling or Suarez - No. 

Great post by you, and I think he isnt going to give us anything that we dont already have. Why would he succeed at LFC? What does he provide in terms of counter attacking play? What does he offer in terms of pace and ability to ghost in behind defenses, which is our style of play and we are builing it further by signing one of the best passers while possessing another one already? 

He is an improvement in terms of pressing, set piece ability and running at defences. Good qualities, but not qualitites that will make sure he succeeds here. He's missing the most important one for me. 

Unless something drastic happens and we play 2 strikers, or we turn into defence to attack hoofers leaving the midfield alone, he will not cut it.

I'm a City fan, not a Dzeko fan, so I'm neutral - unlike yourself.

&gt;Dzeko holds the Bundesliga record for the most scoring duo of all time.

A - Grafite scored more goals for Wolfsburg than Dzeko that year.

B - The Bundesliga is an inferior league to the Premier League, even more so 7 years ago.

&gt;When Bosnia played 4-2-2 guess who was the most scoring duo in Euro zone qualifiers?

Dzeko scored a few goals against third rate European sides in qualifying, phenomenal achievement.

&gt;*The relationship between City’s strikers has always been slightly confusing, even in the Roberto Mancini days. Edin Dzeko and Sergio Aguero is a slightly uneasy partnership, because it’s never entirely certain what Aguero’s role in the side is. Clearly a hugely talented individual, sometimes you wonder whether he’s happier playing just behind a main striker, or playing higher up and sprinting in behind. When he manages to combine the two roles in the same performance he can be unstoppable, but when things are going against his side, he can cause tactical problems.*

That quote doesn't at all support what you were saying. You said that Dzeko played behind Aguero, nowhere in that quote is that supported. In fact in the formation analysis it has Aguero's average position as behind Dzeko.

You're clueless.

I agree with the quote btw, the partnership hasn't worked overall, only fleetingly. You're just trying to lay the blame for this at Aguero's door, or Mancini/Pellegrini, and absolve Dzeko of any responsibility. The Negredo-Aguero partnership worked, Aguero's proven himself able to form cohesive partnerships with other frontmen at this club. Did just that with Diego Forlan at Atletico also.

Dzeko has played with Balotelli, Tevez, Aguero, Negredo, Jovetic and hasn't formed a successful partnership with any of them.

You don't think he's at all at fault?

I don't think he's been helped by our style of play at times, and rotation. Our style of play hasn't always suited him, and he's a confidence player who can be a bit precious.

But he is certainly culpable in that lack of a successful partnership forming. Without doubt.

Ultimately I just don't think he made the grade.

He needs to have a team built around him, and to be a big fish in a small pond.

null,false,Melberger,1972crest,,null,"And re your isolated quote from the tactical analysis to support a bullshit point that Aguero's game causes 'tactical problems' for Dzeko.

This is the revelevant quote in full, and in context:

&gt;The 4-4-2 has enjoyed something of a return to prominence so far this season, with both the Manchester derby and Madrid derby in the last ten days being 4-4-2 against 4-4-2, but in a match Pellegrini had acknowledged would see both sides trying to dominate possession, it was a huge surprise to see him use two forwards with no specific instructions for either to contribute defensively.

&gt;The relationship between City’s strikers has always been slightly confusing, even in the Roberto Mancini days. Edin Dzeko and Sergio Aguero is a slightly uneasy partnership, because it’s never entirely certain what Aguero’s role in the side is. Clearly a hugely talented individual, sometimes you wonder whether he’s happier playing just behind a main striker, or playing higher up and sprinting in behind. When he manages to combine the two roles in the same performance he can be unstoppable, but when things are going against his side, he can cause tactical problems.

&gt;This was a good example. If City were attempting to play two strikers against Bayern, there were two ways it could have proven a success. First, it could have worked if they managed to turn this into a high-tempo, fast and furious ‘English’ contest based around getting the ball forward quickly and taking advantage of Bayern’s lack of a spare man at the back. If this was going to be a possession battle, however, they needed to get an extra man into the centre of the pitch, which meant Aguero dropping onto Lahm and helping out in midfield.

&gt;But that didn’t remotely happen in the first half, with Aguero staying high up, and Lahm completely free between the lines.

Your highlighted **tactical problems** quote is referring to vulnerabilities that playing two up top can have when we're out of possession, defensively. Because Aguero doesn't work hard enough out of possession, and neither does Dzeko.

The tactical criticism being that two up front against a side like Bayern is flawed, especially if they don't work hard enough when out of possession.

The quote was not at all making a point that Aguero creates tactical fucking problems for Dzeko.

null,false,MarkEasty,null,null,null,"Cockney Wanker is a character created by Graham Dury and Simon Thorpe in Viz based on a stereotype male Cockney. Wanker is a thief, conman, charlatan, a bigotted racist (unless it is Frank Bruno) and a wife beater who speaks in rhyming slang and spends his days drinking and selling stolen or unworkable goods to passers-by from an East-end market stall. Another of Wanker's specialities is used cars. Playing upon the stereotype of the indigenous population of London being fantasists, Wanker often buys a car, sells it back to the same person, for the same amount of money, then declares the transaction to have been, ""A nice little earner!"" He wears cheap gold jewellery or Argos bling and 'Laahndan' gangster dark glasses, and is often seen smoking a cigar.

He is a wife-beater and lifelong racist who complains about ""Sooties"", yet respects Frank Bruno. He is established as a royalist, especially supportive of the Queen Mother, spouting received wisdom such as ""Ninety Free she is. Ninety Free. Wahn the bladdy war for us she did!""

Wanker's appearance is based on a combination of a stereotypical London taxi driver and Mike Reid's character Frank Butcher from EastEnders. His characterisation also draws elements from David Jason's ""Del Trotter"" out of Only Fools and Horses.

However, as you stated before he has a had a few recent injuries and with Sturridge being very injury-prone, we need a player we can rely on for at least 30 league matches a season. Not only that but Villa want 32.5m for him, which no one is begrudging them for. He is their player and a very good player that they are entitled to hold out for. The last time we paid that sort of money for a big striker in our league, it was an absolute mess. That disappointment is still fresh in everyone's mind so I believe that is one of the reasons that we aren't begging the board to sign him. 

There's also the way Liverpool do business these days. FSG want to buy young players for a low to medium amount, develop them and make them worth more. I personally believe this is the most amount of money Benteke will ever go for and that is putting the board off. 

Who knows though, the window doesn't close for a long time and with the lack of quality strikers for sale the board might change their mind

This is exactly the issue. Last season when we bought him, I remember a few of us talking about how he drops too deep. He wants to do it all, and props for that, but his role is being diluted if he doesnt stay in that box. It's a good thing having the passing skill, but not at the expense of:

a. Your ability and positioning to score goals.

b. The dilution or diversion of your main job or role in the team.

Scotland doesn't have those privileges - AFAIK, every sovereign state in the world recognises British sovereignty over Scotland.

null,false,oj109,null,null,null,"I wanted this to be good, but it's pretty short sighted and not very engaging. It's kind of silly that Cory based his decisions on what is happening now (in the next 5 year period) where the effects of the infrastructure investment in LA/Tories scaling back govt provisions will be felt when it's *completed* - a lot can happen in that time period. Heck, maybe the Green party will even win a landslide and turn us into Sweden 2.0 in 2020.

As much as we like to complain, London isn't that bad. In fact, of all the places I've been I'd rank it up there with Singapore and New York and miles ahead of any other city if you can afford it. Affording London is possible but you have to make concessions such as living in a flat or out there in Middlesex/Surrey - it just depends on how far you're willing to accept it. The negatives of LA will soon kick in for Cory - which is a whole different set of problems. Some of them include urban sprawl (it takes 20 minutes to get anywhere and impossible parking), real ghettos, legitimately being fearful of gun crime, lack of social security and health despite current improvements.

Having said that, I can see the appeal of LA. Year round sunshine, a culture of health and fitness, a huge availability of high paid jobs and super cheap property - a 4 bed house with a pool, proximity to job and beaches in a gated community in a more expensive part of OC would only cost £400,000. Decent house in a nice area for £250,000 easy. Wages are a little higher but consumer prices are dirt cheap. But, move to LA because you really love the city for what it is - not because you're a little jaded of the political situation or want to live like a king. If you have that mentality, then regardless of wherever you go it'll never be good enough. You have to take the good with the bad and decide whether it's worth the trade off.",null,0,null,1435652291,null,0,1435659236,0,csnci3a,null,t3_3blygl,null,t1_csnci3a,null,t3_3blygl,null,null,null,1437458516,null,16,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,16,null

Moved to Singapore, and I honestly love the city. It's my Xanadu. I have to make do with an apartment (landed houses are prohibitively expensive) but the apartments are ***freehold***, have tons of amenities like a concierge, tennis courts, rooftop gardens/pools with really low maintenance fees. [Most condos are actually the same size as UK houses and tend to look like this.](http://www.e-architect.co.uk/images/jpgs/singapore/newton_suites_woha150808_albertlim2.jpg) Shopping is amazing, it's super cheap to live here aside from property - but it's still 1/2 the price of London or Australia - you can still find 3 bedroom apartments in a luxury condo for just under $1 million/£500,000. Prices for a 1 bed flat start as low as $300k. I'm a 9 hour flight from almost anywhere in the world. Tons of great, high paying jobs here.

* As voter turnout is increasing, no one is particularly worried.

Get your doctor to refer you to a mental health specialist though and don't take no for an answer. A good tactic I found was ( even if I wasn't feeling particularly anxious the day I saw the doctor, you can't just turn anxiety on and off ) was to really ham it up when I went to see him and force the issue that you need to see a specialist as it is totally affecting your quality of life. Do *not* let your doctor palm you off with the first course of drugs that comes into their heads. Get some specialist advice on that. 

I got a course of CBT after a few moths and it really helped. Also you need to exercise my friend. Cardio for 20-60mins at least three times a week. It's one of the *best* things you can do for anxiety.

Yet as they hit puberty, and start differentiating themselves more, the balance slowly comes back to the more usual and expected male-dominated proportions.  Now this *could* be due to the female mind not being as adept at graphic design as the male mind, but they don't seem to see that with the results.  It's seems to them to be solely about girls and boys being given different roles, even from as early as primary school.

Now this is an anecdote, and it also doesn't say a huge amount about why girls seem not to want to do computer-based activities, but it still seems incredibly scary to me, because it implies that there were clearly girls who originally wanted to take part, but have chosen not to take part as they have grown older, and that seems to me to be a huge red flag that some form of peer-pressure is involved.",null,0,null,1435654057,null,0,false,0,csncxdk,null,t3_3bjbh8,null,t1_csncxdk,null,t1_csn317j,null,null,null,1437458866,null,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

null,false,gamas,,Labour Member,null,"&gt; Whats moral about putting our grandchildren into debt to subsidise our lifestyles? What makes sense about paying more in debt interest payments than education our children?

What's moral about our grandchildren growing up in poverty because our government wasn't willing to support those who need it? What makes sense about talking about paying more in debt interest payments than education, when the education budget is one of the main funding areas that is hit in the pursuit to decrease the deficit?

The country benefits when everyone can have a chance in life. I grew up in a poor family (like we were actually eligible for a yearly food hamper at one point), yet I was given the opportunity to go into university due to various funding schemes set up by the government, and I am now in the process of finishing up a PhD due to financial support given by the EPSRC research fund (I was genuinely one of the last students funded by EPSRC).

When you cut welfare, education, and healthcare, you ARE jeopardising the lives of our grandchildren? And for what, some far off pipe dream of paying off £1.56 trillion? There are only 5 countries in the world who are debt free - two of them aren't even independent, and all of them have a population of less than a million. The idea of a country with 10s of millions of people to look after paying off a national debt is a laughable concept.

In my view, a country succeeds when EVERYONE is given the right start in life. And is that not what Labour is ultimately all about - giving people poor, or rich, young or old, able or disabled the means and ability to achieve their potential. Kendall wishes to throw all that away for some mythical idea of a large country without debt, and that is why I can't support her. Getting rid of the national debt is impossible without killing off 99% of the population, but it is certainly possible, and in our power to ensure that everyone gets the right level of support they need to get where they want to be in life.

I want to be clear, I'm not as hardcore as Jeremy Corbyn - I understand that the deficit is something that we should be concerned with. However, making across the board cuts, just isn't going to... well- cut it..  We need to make savings, but we also need to make investments and that is not going to happen by cutting the welfare state, slashing education, and jeopardising the health system.",null,0,null,1435654360,null,0,1435655134,0,csnczya,null,t3_3bfw0g,null,t1_csnczya,null,t1_csncmch,null,null,null,1437458912,null,2,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,2,null

null,false,G_Comstock,null,null,null,"Indeed, this is the classical position within British political theory. A strong government capable of executive expedience is of primary importance. 

Often this privileging of expediency is discussed in relation to our ability to respond to external threats and wage war. However I can't help thinking that this was rather more crucial when we were acting as hegemon in the 18th and 19th centuries. Our ability to declare war or not with alacrity seems of less importance in contemporary global politics.

One of the pernicious effects of our preference for majorities and strong government over coalition and consensus building that I find particularly troublesome is that it exaggerates the political cycle. Each new government, having won its freedom of action as a result of a voting system which exaggerates its support, has an incentive to reverse previous policy courses and prioritise short term changes within departments. Talk to teachers, healthcare workers, military personnel who have been in their role for a few decades and most will be happy to complain at length about the constant changes in priorities and targets, reorganisations and general political footballness they must spend time, effort and resources reacting to. The same goes for businesses responding to the changing regulatory environment, individuals having to negotiate changes within the taxation and benefits system.  

As an aside, political commentary within the UK often compares the political agency empowered by the British system with US congressional deadlock or Belgium political separatism. Rarely does it compare itself with Germanic consensus based systems. Few would claim that the Reichstag lacks the ability to enact change. That said they have a very different political culture and history.

I think a lot of people think that it might happen in the next couple decades but I think we are probably talking the next century. I think if their is such a simple source of energy available that is economically viable to produce, then it will be produced.  Western Governments will probably wait until their own reserves run out before they start trying to tell every other nation to stop using hydrocarbons but maybe I'm being cynical.


From a personal perspective, I'm in a fairly lucky position at the moment as I managed to get a job a couple of years before the oil price crash, in a smaller company which, as of yet, has not had to let anyone go. Companies are pretty much hiring zero new graduates across the industry and so I am one of very few people of my age gaining good experience in O&amp;G, which gives me a competitive advantage if the oil price was to increase and production pick back up. Whether there is enough work in Aberdeen for the rest of my career, I'm not sure. My boss is fairly confident there is at least 40 years of current level of activity left in the North Sea and many more years of production left overseas in Africa, Middle east, Asia and the Americas.


To give you an idea of the state of affairs in the North sea... I was shown a graph of lifting costs ($/barrel of oil) for all the operators in the North Sea and only 2 or 3 out of about 20 were in the profitable region, and this was before the oil price crash. Some companies lifting costs are over 200$ per barrel of oil and the price per barrel is about $60 at the moment.

No, it won't.  In fact, I'd go so far as to predict another Tory majority government in 5 years.  Why?  For several reasons;

- Cameron has clearly stated his desire not to run for a third term, meaning that at some point during *this* government he must resign to let someone else take over and prepare for the next election.  This will be just in time for the British public to get pissed off enough with the Tories and fancy a change, then along comes Boris Johnson, or Theresa May, or George Osborne to take over the Tories and renew public interest in them.
- The Lib Dems have been decimated to just a handful of MPs, only one of which the public actually know the name of (Nick Clegg, the previous Lib Dem leader).  The Lib Dems have an upcoming leadership contest that the public is largely uninterested in.  Whoever wins this contest is going to be essentially irrelevant in terms of political clout.
- Labour are suffering from the same problem.  The two people most likely to win the Labour leadership contest are Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham. Both would make terrible leaders and whoever wins will end up suffering the same fate as Miliband did a few months back.  The Unions favour Burnham, who is probably most likely to win (even with the voting power of the Unions having been restricted).  The Unions have learned absolutely nothing from allowing the wrong Miliband to run Labour.
- UKIP are essentially irrelevant now, given that the Tories are letting us have a referendum on Europe.  Farage himself will gradually slip into the background and will disappear altogether when Britain votes to stay in Europe.  

I'm not a Tory.  I can't stand them.  But they are the only party right now that isn't in the grip of an identity crisis.

One absolute gem my CBT counsellor taught me ( apart from the mechanism of fight, flight or freeze and the self perpetuating cycle behind anxiety ) is that you need to bring down your general level of anxiety. 

You're basically always on a tipping point with anxiety, it's always there and if your general level of anxiety is high it takes you nothing to tip the scales and that sends you into anxiety and panic attacks. 

However, if you can bring that general anxiety level down it takes a lot more to tip it and when it takes more to tip the anxiety you start to forget about it i.e. you get out of that headspace where it's constantly on your mind.  

It can be a long process though to do this. 

I found cardio exercise and a proper diet really helped with this, I literally forced myself into a gym three times a week for an hour at a time. Now it's two. Eventually it started to reduce my general level of anxiety and stress. 

It's that getting out of your own head that you need to tackle. Once you do that, the rest is a breeze.

That's because demonstrating pharmacological causation in psychoactive substances is almost impossible, unless you’re going to get a human guinea pig to take it. Consequently, there have only been four successful prosecutions in five years.

This is the key issue, you can pontificate over the morality of drug laws all you like, but the fact is that prohibition policies do not and never have worked.

The way we view drugs today is badly skewed; we categorise and leglislate drugs based on emotion rather than science and data. This is why most of us are happy to use alcohol (a damaging and insidiously addicting drug) over something like MDMA (which is not physically addictive and actually discourages repeated use since using it too frequently results in severely diminished effects), or cannabis which, while habit forming, is less harmful and addictive than alcohol and has been the drug of choice for millions of people for millennia. If we have the right to use alcohol, then we should absolutely have the right to use cannabis.

We sweep illegal drugs under the rug and pretend only addicts and degenerates use them, when in fact most drugs are used responsibly by all classes of people. We call illegal drugs ""controlled substances"", yet they're anything but controlled; instead they're freely available to children 24/7 from your local dealer, with no age limit and no quality control. I bought my first bag of weed at 13, I've been buying it somewhat regularly ever since. I also got drunk for the first time that same year, but alcohol was very rare treat until I had friends who looked old enough to buy it. Your teenage son/daughter will probably try drugs or alcohol by the time they're 16 or so, **you don't get a choice in the matter**, what you have a choice in is how regularly they obtain those drugs and how safely regulated those drugs are. Think you can prevent your child from trying drugs? Because society tried that with sex for decades and it turns out that abstinence doesn't work; unless you want a pregnant daughter with an STD...

When it comes to addicts (a tiny percentage of drug users), we demonise them as impulsive scum unable to control their urges, when in fact they are our children, our parents, our co-workers and our loved ones. They are *people who need help* and this culture of mockery and demonisation means the very people who have a problem are reluctant to find help. If you had a coke problem, and you were genuinely frightened for your well-being, could you tell your boss? Your parents? What would their reaction be?

People think only the poor and weak become addicts, but addiction depends on so many factors that anyone can become an addict at any time in their lives.

Humans are hard-wired to seek out and use drugs, so ending drug use is an impossibility, but making it safer for everyone is not.

As for executions and criminalisation of homosexuality, these aren't great examples for you to have used in the first place. They aren't things votes are likely to ever be held about - or perhaps even *could* be held about - in our current system. There are human rights laws which exist specifically to *bar* the prejudice of the majority from impinging upon the rights of minorities, so these specific examples are likely not things the democratic process will ever be able to touch.

**Brief History:** During the Gurkha War (1814–1816) between the Gorkha Kingdom in Nepal and the East India Company the British were impressed by the Gorkhali soldiers which they called Gurkhas. In the Peace Treaty it was agreed that Gorkhalis could be recruited to serve under contract in the East India Company's army.

During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, Gurkhas fought on the British side, and became part of the British Indian Army on its formation. From the end of the Indian Rebellion until Indian Independence in 1947 the Gurkha Regiments saw active service all over the world, including during World War I &amp; II. 

After Indian independence in 1947 the original Gurkha regiments were split between the British Army and the newly independent Indian Army. Six Gurkha regiments (twelve battalions) were transferred to the post-independence Indian Army, while four regiments (eight battalions) were transferred to the British Army.

Go along to B in the first week and A in the second. See which you like more.

I found materials fun and I'm glad I did it over CompSci. CompSci would've been easier but less novel to me. Overall it's a personal choice and one that doesn't really matter in the Grand Scheme.

The best way to get assistance is to ask your GP what to do - they helped my brother apply for ESA due to his mental state preventing him from making an adequate application (he suffers with Depression and ADD), and he was put into the support group within a few weeks. You should be able to receive the same level of care if your depression is preventing you from working adequately - tell the GP this and tell them hence you don't think you'd be able to research and apply for benefits reliably without assistance. They will then ensure that you get the correct help.

The best advice I could offer anyone applying for benefits with a medical condition would be to ask your doctor for help, better than that, insist that you need help - as with most mental illnesses, the skills you're unable to use due to your illness are the same skills you need to use to apply for benefits properly, and the system as we have it is so damn terrible that it doesn't consider that someone might be too ill to figure out how to apply properly, therefore people often end up applying for the wrong thing or applying without giving necessary information. A good GP will be able to offer you help or advice with applying, but due to the nature of the NHS you'll often find you have to insist you need help in order to actually get it, rather than wait to be offered support.",null,0,null,1435659162,null,0,1435659752,0,csne2u1,null,t3_3blynu,null,t1_csne2u1,null,t3_3blynu,null,null,null,1437459447,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

I am also looking to buy, Clifton is expensive, and is known for the damp problems and things that come with buildings of that era, also youd be lucky to get double glazing in the nicer parts. Redland is similar.

I'm personally looking in the Bedminster/Southville/Ashton area, Bedminster was bad years ago, but now that North Street and beyond has become more and more popular its not bad now. Its where a lot of people that want to live in Clifton but can't afford it often move to - hence why estate agents call it 'little clifton' and the saying 'rent in clifton, buy in southville' comes from.

Other areas would be around the Gloucester Road / Montpelier which is on the North side rather than the South. It depends where you will be working or whatever you are doing in the area. 

If you can afford clifton/redland then its always a very nice area, parking isnt impossible as some people suggest, but it will be hard. And its a touristy part, so gets busier than youd think at weekends.",null,0,null,1435661792,null,0,false,0,csneot9,null,t3_3b83vs,null,t1_csneot9,null,t3_3b83vs,null,null,null,1437459973,null,2,false,bristol,t5_2r52c,2,null

I'll offer up Leeds &amp; my own situation as an example; I'm currently renting a 2-bed in a really good, low crime area for £495 / month (and you can buy a 4 bed house in a good area for under £300K), still within 10-15 min drive or 20-30 min bus from the city centre, and beautiful countryside with craggs, forest, etc is 5 minutes drive the other away.  

There are businesses of all sizes, and although the salaries might not match London, you don't really need them to.  I currently work for a very small mobile app company (seriously, there's 4 of us, including my boss's wife), previously I worked for a larger inner-city e-commerce agency but didn't enjoy the environment, and when I handed in my notice, they first tried to convince me to stay, and then were asking if I knew anyone looking as they were struggling to fill positions (decent company to work for as well, just not my thing).  I'm a fairly decent programmer, but certainly not top of my field or anything, so this speaks more of the job market than it does of my own skills.

It's even feasible to get a mortgage for a house on 1 salary here (2-3 bed terraced in ""meh"" area for £110K - £130K), so you could start a family and have only 1 parent working, upgrade to a nicer area once the kids start school and the 2nd parent can return to work.

I disagree. Shanghai has 30 million and is still cheaper (relative to local wages) and easier to get around. And the key bit here is ""if you can afford it""

&gt;Affording London is possible but you have to make concessions such as living in a flat or out there in Middlesex/Surrey - it just depends on how far you're willing to accept it. 

This is such bad stockholm syndrome. You're basically saying - London is amazing, though of course you can't afford to actually live *in* London. But living adjacent to it is amazing!

The main issues to me that are holding London back are:

1) Lack of affordable housing. It's nuts. Rent is skyrocketing, and the actual cost of buying houses is insane. For some reason governments will commit to *anything* but actually building more houses, which is really the only thing that'll make a difference

2) Not building up. There is no good reason why London should be such a low-storey city. Most other global cities build apartment blocks and towers because they recognise that not having a garden is a fair trade off for not having to make a 1hr30 commute into work every day! Yes, it does mean that some iconic landmarks may not be out on their own anymore (which isn't necessarily a bad thing - [it can be a good look](http://hqwallbase.com/images/big/shanghai_waterfront_at_night-1559674.jpg)) but it'd also mean that people could actually afford to *live* in Zones 1 and 2.",null,0,null,1435663464,null,0,false,0,csnf4fh,null,t3_3blygl,null,t1_csnf4fh,null,t1_csnci3a,null,null,null,1437460257,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

&gt;yet they're anything but controlled; instead they're freely available to children 24/7 from your local dealer, with no age limit and no quality control

The problems in terms of ""this is far more dangerous than it needs to be"" don't start and end with the quality of stuff you buy. I've been in situations where it seems things might be going a little wrong and no one is ever going to phone an ambulance when the building is full of people high as anything with piles of class A stuff lying around.

What am I taking? How much am I taking? What should the effects be? What shouldn't I take this with? What do I do if it goes wrong? *How do I even take this at all?* These are all questions where the wrong answer makes the potential for harm skyrocket and pretty much the only reason there isn't an easy answer available is because the substances in question are prohibited. 

&gt; Because society tried that with sex for decades and it turns out that abstinence doesn't work; unless you want a pregnant daughter with an STD...

Annoyingly, it *appears* to work better with drugs because drug use *isn't* endemic in the same way alcohol and sex are. I'd say the split of my friends who take drugs is roughly in line with national averages, and the ones who don't by and large have had zero exposure to anything at all. I'm 26 - apart from a few spliffs I didn't really take anything myself until I was 23 and actually didn't have the opportunity to. I don't believe my life was particularly sheltered or unique in that regard.

The circular ""drugs are illegal because they are bad, and they are bad because they are illegal"" is so frustratingly entrenched, and arguing against it if you take drugs yourself opens you to easy accusations of bias. If I have one bad high on MD (say) out of many I'll get chastised for not being careful or not knowing what I'm doing with a ""dangerous"" substance, conveniently ignoring any and all negative experiences I've had with alcohol which have on the whole been far more catastrophic in both a financial and a health sense.

Smaller, frequent changes usually cause less problems. And if they do cause problems, the issue is minimal compared to if you'd waited ages, and can hopefully be fixed.

It's capitalism for the poor, and socialism (corporate welfare) for the rich.


&gt;On Tuesday George Osborne decided at last to review the private finance initiative (PFI), under which the companies building public infrastructure made stupendous profits while the state retained the risks. But if you thought that the chancellor's decision represented a wider shift in policy, you'll be sorely disappointed. Two days later he agreed to sell the state-owned bank Northern Rock to Richard Branson. Under the deal, the state keeps the liabilities while Branson gets the assets – rather like PFI. The loss equates to £13 for every taxpayer.

&gt;Someone who will not suffer unduly from being touched for £13 is Matt Ridley. As chairman of Northern Rock, he was responsible, according to the Treasury select committee, for the ""high-risk, reckless business strategy"" which caused the first run on a UK bank since 1878. Before he became chairman, a position he appears to have inherited from his father, Ridley was one of this country's fiercest exponents of laissez-faire capitalism. He described government as ""a self-seeking flea on the backs of the more productive people of this world … governments do not run countries, they parasitise them.""

&gt;The self-seeking parasite bailed out his catastrophic attempt to put his ideas into practice, to the tune of £27bn. What did the talented Mr Ridley learn from this experience? The square root of nothing. He went on to publish a book in which he excoriated the regulation of business by the state's ""parasitic bureaucracy"" and claimed that the market system makes self-interest ""thoroughly virtuous"".

Any attempt to build a regional identity assumes that

1.  everyone understands what the region is (would everyone know what you mean by NI, or Ulster, or County Armagh, or the old kingdom of Airgialla/Oriel?)
* people want to be defined as being from that region
* the region is meaningfully distinct from neighbouring regions

1 is true, 2 is true for unionists and an increasing number of nationalists, and 3 is thorny for some in both the loyalist and republican camps.

The other constituent nations of the UK don't have this problem because they have long histories as separate kingdoms. Regionalism is different in Ireland - people only tend to identify with their province for sport; day-to-day, counties are a much more common division. So building an 'NI' identity imposes a British format onto an Irish fabric - 100 years isn't a long time for that to develop, even without the divisions and conflict of the past 40 years.

I don't think the development of an NI identity is impossible or undesirable. Whether unionist or nationalist, I think an NI identity that is palatable for both 'sides' would help with meaningful integration - embracing both the green and orange aspects of NI culture. A new flag would help a lot there. I still like that design posted a while ago with the six hexagons, though the colours would always be problematic... But a peaceful and internally-united NI is desirable for everyone, as neither government wants responsibility for the sociopolitical basket case we have now.

The BBC'S success is not in producing good original content;  outside of a small number of series copied from national geographic  with truly colossal budgets and the BBC Web site which is one of the most expensive in the world, virtually all its flagship output is decades old and we all know it. 

The BBC'S success is in convincing British people to universally back them and to insist in spite of evidence such as the above that the BBC'S output is world class, ground breaking and the envy of all.

&gt;See also [List of districts in Northern Ireland by national identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_districts_in_Northern_Ireland_by_national_identity)

&gt;In Northern Ireland national identity is complex. Many in Northern Ireland have a [British national identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_people) seeing the English, Scots and Welsh as fellow members of their common nation while seeing those from the [Republic of Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland) as foreigners. Many others in Northern Ireland see those from the Republic of Ireland as being members of their common nation encompassing the [island of Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland) and see the English, Scots and Welsh as foreigners. Co-existing with this dichotomy is a Northern Irish identity which can be held alone or, as is also the case with Englishness, Scottishness and Welshness, alongside a British identity, or alongside an Irish identity. A small number of people see themselves as being both British and Irish.

&gt;While there is a strong correlation between religion and national identity, Catholics tending to identify as Irish and Protestants tending to identify as British, this is not an absolute relationship, and the correlation is much weaker amongst Catholics than it is amongst Protestants. Amongst Catholics geography also plays an important role, with Catholics in the east of Northern Ireland being more likely to call themselves British and less likely to call themselves Irish than Catholics in the west of Northern Ireland, though Belfast is somewhat of an anomaly to that pattern. There are four of the twenty-six districts of Northern Ireland, all along the eastern coast, where more Catholics consider themselves British than consider themselves Irish.

A lot of people here complain that a big problem with politics today is that it feels so removed from modern life - parliament is filled with people who have no relevance to us, who got there by being pals with the right person.  Under a purely-PR system, that would get worse - we as the voting public would have little-to-no ability to choose the party lists, and it would be far harder than it is now to get rid of spectacularly unpopular MPs.

I don't think FPTP is a good way of electing a government, and to be honest even AV/STV-type compromises have similar issues.

Basically with most European railways you could buy a ticket from the Scottish Highlands to the border of Russia-North Korea border or somewhere in Kazakhstan. But you won't be able to buy them in the UK since the UK just stopped selling these tickets. It's in part due to some railways requiring printed tickets (e.g. France) and due to the introduction of those credit card sized tickets everywhere in the UK. Think they stopped this in 2003, now you can only use some agencies which use another railway's system. In the UK nowadays you can only buy international tickets for the limited range Eurostar offers (some places in France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Switzerland) and some places where there are special agreements. You can get anywhere in Ireland by ferry, from East Anglia to anywhere in the Netherlands by ferry or from the South East to Calais by ferry.

No. Thats absolutely not true. You think everyone should be *forced* to live *your* way because you're right and everyone else is wrong, of course. You cannot fathom that there are good people who disagree with you and you just have a nasty, condescending attitude towards those who do.

Your beliefs are no more important than anybody else's and the fact that you don't understand that is what makes free speech so important. The right to protest comes first.

On the other hand, they need to operate on the same basic wavelength as the manager - otherwise they do more harm than good. If the coaching staff aren't bought in on what the manager's overall aim is, then how will the players be?

O'Driscoll fits a lot of that. He's got the same basic views on how football should be played and how clubs should operate, but it's come from his own experiences, not Rodgers' dossier. The only criticism may be that he doesn't compensate for Rodgers' lack of European experience - but Pepijn Lijnders offers some of that.

There was no notion of 'British' culture or ethnicity between the 5th century and the Act of Union in 1707. Any cultural identity you can identify as common across the island of Britain was mainly thanks to the English dominance within the island, and influence from the other home nations/dominions/immigrants coming the other way. 

At no point did the collective inhabitants of Britain decide ""fuck my history"" and adopt a completely new British cultural identity. They remained part of their culture taking on elements of other cultures within the state. This is **cosmopolitanism**.

Your comparison with Turkey is completely incorrect and ignorant of history. Like *Britain*, the Ottoman Empire (precursor to Turkey) was a cosmopolitan state that represented a multitude of cultures underneath it. There was no *Ottoman* ethnicity like there was no *British* ethnicity. It was a political construct formed through Turkish dominance and its cultural identity was a patchwork of the cultures it ruled over.

The only way you could compare the Ottoman Empire to Britian is if Britain killed all Scots and changed the name of the country to ""England"". Turkey no longer represents the cosmopolitan entity the Ottoman Empire used to, and that the United Kingdom still does. It's a nation-state, built through killing ethnic minorities and ignoring the existence of the ones who survived. 

Turkey is a nation-state. Britain isn't, and never has been.

This subreddit is left-leaning and has a young demographic. The Tories will never be popular in here and their economic policies will always be regarded as bad here.

The issue is an economic one which is obviously very complicated if you want to drill right down into it. The British state is running a deficit and has been for some time, and our national debt is quite high. The Conservatives have come to power and are presiding over an economic policy that suits their ideology: they've reduced taxes for both people and businesses (though I suspect they're probably still higher than the US tax rates) and are reducing government spending even more. They're selling off government stakes in many banks, the Post Office, and so on and are preparing to allow people to buy government-owned houses that they're currently renting.

Their ideal outcome is a nation where the government is small and doesn't intervene much in people's lives and doesn't take a lot in taxation. They're firm believers in private sector primacy and will be continuing to take steps towards withdrawing government oversight or control from sectors they believe would be better served by private sector providers.

People here are in a rage about that primarily because the Tories are...

1. Preparing legislation that will allow private companies to provide healthcare instead of the NHS. Sectors of healthcare that the NHS can't cover right now will instead go to contractors, while many would prefer it if the NHS were simply given that money to do it themselves.

2. Presiding over heavy cuts to the benefit system upon which many people rely for parts of their income. 

People telling you to worry are being deeply selfish and are putting their own opinions on domestic politics ahead of your own life planning. You shouldn't give a fuck about UK politics, it's 99.9% likely you'll be fine no matter who is in power, because if you're well paid enough to move across an ocean into a very expensive city you're well paid enough that political fights over the benefit system and NHS won't ever personally hurt you.

* Imagine documentary about Frank Gehry.

* Documentary about Haslar, one of the earliest military hospitals, and the state of military medicine at the time of Trafalgar.

* Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell.

* A Flemish drama about a medical outbreak.

null,false,Wommie,null,null,null,"A day might be stretching it.  Perhaps get down to Dover on a Saturday morning and visit the [castle](http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/dover-castle/), there's plenty to see and do there from the castle itself, to all the tunnels below used as a hospital, regional seat of command etc.  You could probably kill best part of a day looking around it all.  It's probably 20 - 30 minutes walk from the train station and there's a quite a step hill leading up to it, might put you off cycling up it.

There's a Premier Inn right underneath the castle on the sea front, if you booked in there for the night, they've got food and a bar I think, then head out along the cliffs the next day (other places are available I'm sure, I'm just trying to keep it all close).  The path up to [Langdon Cliffs aka The White Cliffs of Dover](http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/white-cliffs-dover/visitor-information/) start just by the Eastern Docks, minutes walk from the Premier Inn.  Then it's a very nice walk along the White Cliffs to St. Margaret's Bay, about 3 miles.  There's the [South Forelands light house](http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/south-foreland-lighthouse/) to have a look at, [The Pines Garden Tearoom &amp; Museum](http://pinesgarden.co.uk/), perhaps lunch in The Coastguard pub in the bay itself, then carry on to Walmer and Deal along the cliffs, probably another 3 - 4 miles.  [Walmer castle and its gardens](http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/walmer-castle-and-gardens/) are well worth a visit, the gardens are particularly nice (Deal also has a castle, but's not as good imho).  There's plenty of B&amp;B's in Deal, lots of nice little pubs and restaurants, quaint shops, have a stroll along the pier.

It's all along the same railway line as well, so you can jump on HS1 from St. Pancras and be in Dover in about an hour or so.  Walmer and Deal are the next few stops up the same line.

If you go after the 20th July [Fan Bay Deep Shelter](http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/white-cliffs-dover/things-to-see-and-do/fan-bay/) on the White Cliffs will be open as well, even more war time tunnels to explore.",null,0,null,1435670939,null,0,false,0,csnhtm2,null,t3_3bjv8u,null,t1_csnhtm2,null,t1_csnci3v,null,null,null,1437461927,null,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2,null

null,false,MrJohz,eng-westmidlands,West Midlands,null,"I'm not saying settle with the status quo, that's the complete opposite to what I'm saying, we need to have a national discussion about this right now!  What I am saying is that simple PR has just as many problems as simple FPTP, and that I don't understand the general consensus that local representation is irrelevant in an electoral system.  There are a *lot* of voters for whom local representation is the strongest part of our electoral system.  (Admittedly, it's probably the only strong part, but as I said before, I'm not advocating that we simply stick to FPTP...)

To be honest, currently I'm quite enamoured with [MMPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-member_proportional_representation), where one votes for both a local representative and a national party, and, once the local representation has been met, more MPs are added to make up the numbers.  However, there are issues with this.  All constituents still have a local MP, but not all MPs have a specific region of constituents.  Is that an acceptable compromise?  It may well become more difficult to remove powerful MPs that have high disapproval ratings - a party can simply put them in the party lists and force them in that way.

I guess what I'm most concerned about with this row is that we aren't getting to the root of the issue.  There are a huge number of electoral systems, and none of them will be perfect (interestingly enough, this can actually be proven, given a clear set of rules on what ""perfect"" is).  However, we can have some aspects of a voting system.  What aspects?  I honestly don't know.  I do however know that this subreddit and my own discussions don't represent anywhere near a common national opinion, which is something that we need to be finding right now.

&gt;Toward the end of 1932 we visited a banker named Arnholt. After dinner, while the men, all Jews but me, sat over coffee, several boasted of giving money to the Nazi party at the request of Aryans like Schacht and Thyssen! My face must have betrayed my amazement. The host politely asked what I was thinking.

Also, if any one knows of a good healing mask on the high street/Boots it'd be much appreciated.

Not £12 a month worth.

&gt; It provides a trusted news source. It projects soft power. It provides a cultural identity. It provides media free from interference of advertisers 

There's an argument for maintaining a core public service broadcaster, though not the entire BBC as a taxpayer funded entity

&gt; and that pulls the quality of other stations up.

You mean like how they basically copy programmes from the commercial TV industry? (e.g. The Voice)?

&gt;  Go to the States if you want to see a completely commercial TV system. Fucking ads every 5 minutes, shouting at you, all kinds of crap they can only get away with because there is no competition pulling them up. 

For the same reasons that comparisons to US healthcare are useless when talking about the NHS, so is this.

A better comparison would be actual ad-supported UK TV. Like ITV, Ch4, Ch5, Sky etc. I don't find the ads to be a big deal.

&gt; I'd also add that as a teacher it provides invaluable resources and educational programs that no other station even comes close to. I can't show my kids a C5 documentary, but almost always I can find a BBC one that's the right quality.

Do they still show GCSE Bitesize episodes from 10 years ago?

&gt; The value of the BBC extends well beyond it's programming.

null,false,somethingdifferent34,null,null,null,"The very article you're linking to shows that you're exaggerating the severity of this situation:

'A review of 2,152 wells drilled from 1902-2013 found up to 100 ""orphaned"" wells for which no firm is responsible.
Only two cases of well ""failure"" were recorded, but legacy sites are not monitored for leaks, the authors note.'

'The researchers found between 50 and 100 wells in the UK without any obvious parent company.
The safety record of UK onshore oil and gas sites has lessons for shale gas expansion, scientists say
""If those wells were to leak, the question is who is responsible? We don't know - it's not clear,"" Prof Davies told BBC News.'

So we're talking about two failures ever, and 50-100 theoretically problematic sites from many decades ago.

'The report's recommendations were welcomed by the UK Onshore Operators Group (UKOOG), the representative body for the UK onshore oil and gas industry.
A UKOOG statement said: ""The report highlights the very low rate of issues with respect to operational wells in the UK and this underlines the effectiveness of the current regulatory regime.
""Well integrity is a key plank of our regulatory focus and the report highlights the need to monitor wells during and post operations.
""We are in the process of agreeing with government monitoring procedures and post abandonment procedures for shale wells as recommended.""
Ken Cronin, chief executive of UKOOG, added: ""It is important to note that ReFINE's research focuses on historical records and studies.
""The industry and its practices are constantly improving with experience and technology as required by regulation.""'

So basically what this comes down to is that you're saying we should not drill for gas in the UK now, because in the distant past some wells *may* have not been drilled to current standards, and because in the distant past it wasn't required for orphaned wells to be closely monitored after use, *as is required under the UK regulations right now, today.*

It simply doesn't make any sense. And that's *before* you consider that if we don't drill for gas ourselves, we will be buying it from the US, Russia or Qatar - all of which have less strict regulations than we do. So the possible emissions would be emitted either way - and will almost certainly be worse if done by other nations rather than us because they do allow things such as venting that we don't. There's also the additional environmental impact of transporting foreign gas to us, which wouldn't be there otherwise.",null,0,null,1435674441,null,0,false,0,csnjn0y,null,t3_3bhwjb,null,t1_csnjn0y,null,t1_csnfl0v,null,null,null,1437530181,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null
