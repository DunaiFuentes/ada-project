Viewership of football in the US is still a small fraction compared to that of the saturated markets of Europe. Try broadcasting a game during ""NFL Football-Sunday"" and tell me who gets the most viewers: Hence the ""untapped"" adjective. I didn't realize you read everything literally.

But you seem to like the educational bit, so here you go:

MLS is still worth a fraction of all other sports in the US. Furthermore, The Premier League is way pricier to show on TV than the MLS is. That is, NBC needs to pay more money to show PL than MLS. Still, what American companies pay for TV-rights are a fraction of what is paid by Sky in the UK.

However, football is growing quickly in the US. In particular so European football. So while rights to show Premier League football is sold for practically nothing in the US at the moment, it will be very pricey in a few years. So, in a few years, when those deals are written up, it is vital that your own brand is popular to get your part of the pie, and to explain to your sponsors why you are worth more than X amount of millions.

£50 billion pension tax relief a year.
£25 billion of avoidance and £70 billion of evasion a year.  Some people claim the numbers could be £125 billion a year or even higher. 
Current idea to impact 100,000 properties with the so called Mansion tax £1.7 billion a year, currently brings in £30 billion a year council tax revenue. 
Toss in property system worth £2 trillion and we're paying landlords for rents £90 billion a year. Hell I yet to even start on the non dom rule or banking system. 
By my own simple estimates that 1/6 of all current spending covered by 3 simple items. 
HM Treasury has no system explaining why tax relief is given or the costing or benefits. 

Economics needs to be grounded in reality. Policy behind cutting the deficit makes no sense!
None!
Tory party just wants to reduce the state in size only aim and doing more damage over good. 

If we wanted to cut the deficit we would close the above gaps, redone the tax system from the ground up so it becomes fairer.  Stop the transfer of wealth towards the top and point it down towards the bottom.  IF debt was a problem we could take a hair cut so that debt was reduced and easier for us to handle instead the markets are asking us to take on spending so we could drive up demand.  Economic boom years of 1980 to 2008 was driven by the financial sector which resulted in more unequal UK and being forced to bailout without major reforms.  Financial sector is too powerful to be given full freedom requires real rules to control and limit the damage it can do.

Ideally go back to basics with boring products that have minimal irritants, relatively short ingredients lists, only proven beneficial actives.

When you lease the car, you're just paying to borrow the car, nothing more or less than that. You (usually) won't have an option to keep the car at end of the lease contract.

The government almost certainly should not have applied for the IMF loan in 1976. In retrospect it was unnecessary, and the terms of the loan forced needless austerity which damaged the economy and led to the wave of public sector strikes which lost Labour the election in 1979.

And Callaghan could have sold the government's policies more persuasively, for example avoiding his ""Crisis? What crisis?"" moment.

All that was needed was to kick the can along the road for another few years till North Sea oil, but by that time Thatcher's government were in power and took the credit.

Indeed, but the thing is with IS is that it is a cult, and cults have this way of indoctrinating common sense out of people. If they couldn't do this nobody would join them. How many members of Heaven's Gate had their common sense kick in when they learnt to escape earth they had to kill themselves? Once we start to see IS as a Millenarian cult rather than solely a traditional terrorist group, then you start to understand more about IS, who joins it and why. IS have the qualities of a cult:

* They have a infallible leader whose word is law (Al-Baghdadi).
* Said leader makes extraordinary claims about himself (Al-Baghdadi claims to be the Caliph)
* The Cult seeks recruits, often from groups that are vulnerable, naive or looking for something like redemption or a new life (Young people, ex-cons, the mentally ill, the very poor).
* The cult carries out a lot of indoctrination before the person officially joins, usually creating a relationship with someone inside the cult (like what they are doing online).
* The cult then proceeds to separate the person from those who could challenge the cult and de-indoctrinate the person (IS encourage people to do to IS controlled areas in Syria, where all information is controlled and escape is difficult, if not impossible).

Even if a cult has been in the news it's actually not too hard to convince others to join. They google it, they encounter a recruiter who uses their skills to start to indoctrinate them into the cult, in that indoctrination they are told everything they knew about the cult is a lie and such, it's something that happens a lot.

In short it's not merely a case of ""well they should have used their common sense"", what happened to these girls was that they were indoctrinated into a cult.

But as for child locks, I have to reiterate, it's all well in good saying that now, horses and barn doors come to mind. Few parents of teenagers use them and most don't really see the point of them until something happens.

personally, i see a pretty large clear out of players who are either dead wood, or pretty expendable. i honestly can say that i can see (and know some of these guys already are) leaving...stevie, glenjo, enrique, lucas, aspas, alberto, brad smith, kevin stewart, coates, borini, (one of) lambo/balo, manq (he will surely get recalled), and jack dunn. i can fathom alberto staying, he's hyper talented and just not there yet physically, but i could see him staying. but that leaves plenty of room for youngsters to make the step up. i think br is happy to give ojo, wilson, jordan williams, rossiter, sinclair, canos, chiravella, adam phillips and connor randall all a shot...the squad is growing up very quickly and i think he recognizes how much talent our academy has. if even only ojo, rossiter and adam phillips make it, that's an unbelievable production from an academy set up. adam phillips, to me, is truly going to be special. rossiter is the new scouse heartbeat, and if he keeps playing/progressing how people think he will, he can be our next stevie/lucas replacement. ojo is a bit of sterling and ibe, but is left footed. harry wilson isn't as athletic as a bale, but his left foot sure is pretty fucking wicked. anyways i think we'll buy a few players this summer, and honestly can see br trying to play on our youth prospects to continue moving us upwards.",null,0,null,1426022544,null,0,false,0,cpaphsg,null,t3_2yjqkb,null,t1_cpaphsg,null,t1_cpan7fz,null,null,null,1427687906,null,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3,null

i dont know why i've bought such complicated moisturisers! i really dont care about anti aging or fine lines or brightening. only moisturising and no spots. 

I have looked into the sidebar a bit but there's a lot of (really good) info, i was a bit overwhelmed. The lipids thing you mention is interesting but the wiki page isnt up yet. what would i look for in a product? will it specifically say skin identical lipids?
thanks so much for the advice.

You realise the Shah was backed by us and the US while we overthrew Mosaddegh who was a progressive. 

We didn't have to overthrow him and cause this shit pile of mess, Iran came to us and asked us to split more of the profits from their oil. The Saudis did the same thing with the US, the result was that the US split 50/50, killed any form of rebellion and  got mega rich off of it letting their oil companies dominate the industry in the future, we on the other hand turned down any negotiation and had Mosaddegh end up nationalising the industry making us lose out anyway, turn to the UN to be told to fuck off because we were in the wrong and then ended up having to orchestrate this coup and backed the Shah for decades until eventually he got overthrown himself by hardline islamists. [This is all fact.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)

&gt; We act in our own self interests, not against them.

We acted entirely against our own self interests in the middle east, we lost nearly all of our claims, lost our oil in Iran and spawned a ton of islamists and destabilised nations. Overthrowing Iran while refusing any negotiation was one of the worst foreign policy mistakes we made last century. 

It directly influenced Iran and other resource rich middle eastern nations to be strongly sceptical of western nations and they were one of the founding members of OPEC as a result, the oligopoly that has ran and pretty much defacto controlled the oil industry over the past half a century and used it to punish us when they wanted. The failure to manage Iran and our oil interests there directly caused us way more harm in the future than simply fucking sitting down and negotiation with the Iranians on their own oil reserves instead of just refusing everything like we did.

null,false,Nymthae,null,null,null,"Internships typically are as you gathered: shorter term, most commonly over the summer between years of your degree (but sometimes such as the summer after you graduate). Can be both paid and unpaid. May include a shorter/condensed project as your sole focus. 

Industrial placements tend to be like just proper jobs. You're there for 12 months usually, and if you start early (i.e. the June/July, rather than September) many places will keep you on over the following summer so you can earn more, get more experience, and you're genuinely useful to them at that point. Definitely paid. A lot of employers use these placements almost like a 12-month interview so it's not uncommon to find people who return to their placement company after graduation - very handy! Will include longer projects most likely and/or more smaller ones. With mine I had a fairly standard employee contract, whereas with an internship you're never quite under the same umbrella I believe. 

Work experience I guess usually entails a few weeks, or a few hours/single day a week on a longer term. Not paid. I don't see that many things termed with this - it's mainly a term used with reference to school/college kids who do ~2 weeks of work experience (shadowing someone) to gain some brief insight into an area. Internships and longer placements are more common at degree level because they're more in-depth. 

I'd try for internships, but yeah, a large majority of official schemes and routes will be for penultimate year undergraduates. In your case they'd expect you to apply for their graduate scheme rather than their industrial placement - but as you're enrolling in further study then it's not a viable route at this point. With the short duration I think it's a bit easier to convince companies to offer internships so i'd potentially try that route. If you can afford to not be paid then it may be easier to do that than find a paid internship.

People don't join cults for no reason, there must have been a reason why they began talking to the recruiter in the first place, and I bet it was because of home issues or the like.

When rosacea is mild a doctor may not see all your 'symptoms' on one visit. Be specific about the part of your face, how long pimples or redness lasts etc.

There are topical medications that work for both regular acne and rosacea (azelaic acid, metronidazole) if the doctor is unsure or if they think you may have both. But harsh over the counter acne treatments are rarely a good idea if the pimples are solely down to rosacea.

Very important in rosacea is sunscreen, very important with sunscreen is vitamin D (oily fish). Zinc oxide sunscreens have anti microbial and soothing/ calming properties, sorry I have no recommendations but the sunscreen mega review thread is due for the start of spring.

Sorry no I have not finished the Wiki entry on lipids, but the [moisturiser mega review] (http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionUK/comments/2ohd33/the_high_street_moisturisers_reviews/cmn45nb) is split down to account for that and there is a list under each heading.

Anyway, obviously, Abbey doesn't have  a power. The storm didn't exclusively just give powers - sometimes it just messed people up. Because technically, I don't think you can say that Rudy has a power. And there was that money guy who just ""infected"" people, in the first episode of season 4, I think. Or whenever Jess and Finn were first introduced. 

So I guess you could said Abbey was Laura's ""power"". And there was that part when Abbey beat up Laura's boyfriend, and Laura said that she didn't get angry, but ""felt safe"". 

Laura feeling safe was the whole reason that Abbey existed. IMO, Abbey was first created (in Laura's imagination, when she was a child, way before the storm), so that Laura could feel safe at night. She thought Scary was under her bed, etc, and so she created Abbey so that she could keep Laura safe from things like Scary. Oh and I found it a really good detail that Abbey thought that pirates came and took Laura's bunny away.

Well, how about a post explaining why the strike is taking place. What are the aims? Have any offers been made which you feel are unreasonable? Will there be follow up strikes if your goals aren't met? 

""As for Support, Workers taking action have overwhelmingly endorsed it in strike ballots that itself is a sign and a reflection of where we are at."" 


Well that's fantastic. But you still need the public to be on your side instead of opposing you. Who votes the people in at stormont ? The public. 


""not for immediate personal gain but to stand shoulder to shoulder with fellow public sector workers against the Cuts set out in the Stormont House Agreement.""

So the translink workers stand to gain nothing from the strike? Are the other public sector workers striking alongside you? Nope, I know because my father's in work tomorrow. It's only translink people. So you are standing shoulder to shoulder by striking alone? How will this strike help towards the common goal? Will the other public workers strike too? 


"" i'm not gathering information or actually taking a survey, it's making a point that this strike is much more important than fucking petty self interest.""

In what sense? You haven't said it's more important than self interest, just that you were fucked off at people being against it.



And here's why people are going to be fucked off with the strike. Some people aren't going to be able to get into work, which means taking the day off unpaid which they literally cannot afford to do or a days holiday which may have been earmarked for something else. Some of these people may not be able to make it to doctors appointments or other health appointments,  and perhaps they have been waiting months for these. 

Perhaps kids can't get to school and so parents are forced to pay a babysitter or take time off work. 


That's just off the top of my head and these aren't petty reasons. These are valid reasons why some people might be fucked off at a strike. Instead of being a dick, explain why you are on strike and why you have no other choice than to  impact on these people's lives.

&gt;The gender pay gap, based on median hourly earnings excluding overtime, has narrowed for full-time employees, to 9.4% compared with 10.0% in 2013. This is the lowest on record, and despite a relatively large increase between 2012 and 2013, there is an overall downward trend, from 17.4% in 1997.

&gt;The gap for all employees (full-time and part-time) was also the lowest on record at 19.1%, down from 19.8% in 2013. The gap has also decreased in the long-term, from 27.5% in 1997.

&gt;For part-time employees, the higher rate of pay for women than men results in a ‘negative’ gender pay gap.  Although the trend is more volatile than for full-time employees, there is evidence that the gap has widened in the long-term. It has, however, remained relatively stable in recent years, standing at 5.5% in April 2014.

The British government banned Republican and Loyalist groups from TV and radio. This caused the surreal interviews of Gerry Adams where he was replaced by an actor speaking his words.

Because the PIRA planted bombs in the UK but the Loyalists didn't, the Republicans were seen as the main bad guys, even though the Loyalist terrorists killed ~~twice as many~~ about the same number of civilians, and about half as many people in total. But that happened in NI so it didn't count.

It's good that people are finally beginning to realise how much of an advantage United used to gain from intimidation of referees from that old drunk.

Lest we forget how many incorrect big calls they've had over the years to aid them onto success. In my opinion it's one of the main reasons United were never anywhere near as successful in Europe as they were domestically over their extended period of domination in the Premier League for neigh on 20 years - Taggart's influence over the FA and referee's careers in England had no pull in a UEFA competition like the Champions League.

IMO it's definitely a combination of innate qualities and social conditioning, but that's essentially what overcoming sexism is, giving everyone equality regardless of minor biological differences, because we're a civilized society and smart enough to overcome those differences as compared to 2000 years ago.

I think feminists who like to cry ""there are barely any women in high-paying jobs because y'all are sexist"" forget where we came from...a hundred or so years ago women couldn't even vote!

On top of it the machinations actually make our external security weaker as we're specifically creating a weakness for our intelligence agencies to exploit (which could of course be exploited by a 3rd party).  If you're interested in fighting other major powers digitally then the best move is to oppose this.  

Its all about whether or not we choose to make the machinations of a digital police state or not. I'd like to think as liberal nations we're in a position to say no to this. I personally don't see how you justify it based on the current level of threats. They're presently using ISIS to try to force this through which is daft because they haven't actually performed a single terrorist attack abroad ever. Even in a worst case scenario we're talking about a very periodic murder of a thousand or so individuals and for me that's not worth the cost of every individual giving up their digital privacy to the state. There are many other issues within society that take many more lives that we are not interested in solving nor willing to make such sacrifices so I don't see why we should here.   

All I see is hysteria, power hungry intelligence agents and a threat that has been collectively created by Western intelligence agencies and our Saudi ""Allies"" over the past hundred years.

Both our positions can be and I think are true.  Even if *on average* men and women have different preferences, it is still the case that there are many women who want to go into computer science and many men who would want to become nurses, or whatever.

But, at the same time, we should also remember that there are even more men and women who have gender typical preferences and I wouldn't be surprised if in a world absolutely 100% free of any discrimination, you would still see a large imbalance in some fields like physics or programming.  In fact, I suspect we already live quite close to such a world given the fact that these professions tend to operate as results driven meritocracies.

But none of this should matter if only we treated people like individuals and not representatives of their group.  After all, who gives a damn if a computer scientist is male or female?  The important goal is *not* to ensure girls do well or boys do well, but to see that every individual gets the education and help that they need to succeed.

Also, it might be helpful to you if I add that a lender might consider all or part of a street or area to represent a good or bad credit risk. They all have their own tools and financial models to assess the risk involved in lending to a given person, and this could include a broad-brush assumption about a resident from their address, based on socio-economic perception of the location, how other borrowers have managed accounts, susceptibility to fraud, instances of post going missing, etc. 

Loans are generally regarded as a lower risk product than credit cards. This is because the total amount payable in each instalment and overall are agreed upfront, whereas credit cards are rolling, flexible agreements where the outstanding balance and minimum payment can fluctuate.

&gt;a unique rivalry, though one often deemed **more amicable than most**, similar to the Merseyside derby, Derby della Madonnina between Inter and Milan,

Old Firm Derby

&gt;Another primary contributor to the intensity of the rivalry in the west of Scotland was that Rangers supporters are historically native Scots and Ulster Scots, and Celtic supporters are historically Irish-Scots. While the confrontation between the two sets of supporters was often labelled as 'Sectarianism', 'Native-Immigrant tension' was an equally accurate catalyst for hostility between the two teams' supports in Scotland. Rangers' traditional support was largely from the Protestant community, while Celtic's was largely from those of Irish Roman Catholic backgrounds. 

&gt;The ferocity of the rivalry made it rare for a player to represent both teams during his career.

&gt;Opposing fans fought an on-pitch battle in the aftermath of Celtic's 1–0 victory in the 1980 Scottish Cup Final at Hampden. **This remains one of the worst invasions onto a football pitch ever reported**

&gt;Since the events of that day, Old Firm league matches have normally been played in the early afternoon and the possibility of an Old Firm title decider has been deliberately avoided. (In reference to the Hugh Dallas/coin throwing incident)

&gt; some deaths in the past have been directly related to the aftermath of Old Firm matches.

&gt; on Old Firm weekends, violent attacks increase ninefold over normal levels. An increase in domestic abuse can also be attributed to Old Firm fixtures.

null,false,2econdclasscitizen,null,null,null,"What you're suggesting sounds like it would be legal. Your mortgage lender might be a little concerned if it found out that your dad may look to demand repayment with funds from the mortgage account. That said, one of the major selling points of an offset mortgage is that you can access money held in the 'savings' part if you need it, so I don't think a lender could complain too much about an arrangement like the one you've suggested being used to reduce the interest it earns on a customer's borrowing, or that money deposited is removed again later. 

The tax implications would depend on how the arrangement works, in principle and in practice. If the payments you make to your dad are structured to represent the return of the capital he lent you, they wouldn't necessarily create a tax liability. Any interest that is paid to your dad for the use of the money, however, would be subject to income tax in the year it is received. That would need to be declared in his self assessment and added to whatever other taxable income he received that year, on which he'd then be liable to tax at his marginal rate. 

The payment of whatever interest is eventually agreed upon between you could be structured to minimise this liability, by planning to pay it in a year where he is taking less income from other sources, or spreading it out over a number of years. You'd want to evidence the arrangement in writing in case HMRC felt like checking up on it. 

Perhaps it's worth seeing an accountant, tax lawyer or financial adviser to help formulate the best way of achieving your sims with full knowledge of your and your dad's financial situation?

At this rate, Migs is improving but he needs quality competition. It may be unpopular, but I'm in favour of Sergio Romero (28). Much like Migs, he is a great shotstopper but he is also a leader out of the back and is very vocal. Also, he was a big part of the Argentina squad that got to the WC finals. Jasper Cillessen is only 25 and could prove to be a viable alternative, though Romero is available on a free transfer.

In my opinion, Allen is a solid player and has been in great form recently, but I don't think he has the qualities to start in midfield. I see CM/CDM as the one spot where experience is golden. If we have the youth of Can, Hendo and Coutinho buzzing around Lucas then we're usually okay. The issue is he is injury prone and is frequently linked with other clubs. I'd like to see a Jedinak (30)/ Song (27)/ M'Vila (24) / Diame (27) sort of player in that position.

In the striking position, it's no secret that Borini, Balo and Lambo are struggling a bit for goal. Though, due to our investment in Balo I'm in favour of keeping him and selling Lambo and Borini. Call me crazy, but I think we could use a little more of his unpredictability and edge on and off the pitch. Ings is a very possible target and is there if we want him, so why not pull the trigger. He will only go up in value and quality, he's young, and he's English. Three strikers in Studge, Balo and Ings, with Origi and Sterling able to deputise when needed is enough to keep me confident.

Defensively, if Glen, Manquillo and Flanno leave, then we are severely short of fullbacks. It may be cocky, but if Barca is fucking around - let's take a shot at bringing in Dani Alves on a free transfer and good wages (31). He's experienced, and we could use that in the locker room and on the pitch. Wisdom (21) and Illori (22) are returning, and I hope Kolo stays (but I can't blame him if he leaves for game time), so I think we're covered in CB.

Asking what *you* think is not 'promoting stereotypes'. Moreover, looking at how accents are perceived is an important part of sociolinguistics (and the study of spoken language).

You need to be very careful between describing *what* is the case and saying that it *should* be the case.

Linguists distinguish in this way between *descriptive* approaches and *prescriptive* approaches. For example, I can describe the fact that some people think it's OK to use the word nigger to talk about black people (and that would be an important observation) but it doesn't mean I think it's OK to do that.

If you think accent stereotypes *are* damaging then the first important step to eradicating them is to recognise that they exist and work out why. This exercise helps do that.

The tax part of it is going to be submission of an incorrect document to HMRC.  (When she claimed she received £285k, rather than £1.5m.)

Even so, that alone is not what will have earned her that sentence.  The telling part here is going to be, ""using her friend’s bank accounts to hide money and evidence of her spending from her family"".  At this point you've committed fraud.  The amount involved *(around £480k in tax)* will have compounded the offence.

It's worth noting also that HMRC don't have any control over the length of a sentence.  A judge has looked at the facts presented to them and decided a two year sentence fits the crime.

Finally, the comment attributed to the Deloitte expert is deeply misleading.

&gt;Patricia Mock, personal tax expert at Deloitte, said: ""I'm not aware of an inheritance tax case where HMRC has chosen to publicise the outcome of an investigation. But we have seen the trend of naming and shaming taxpayers where other types of tax avoidance are involved.""

HMRC publishes the details of certain taxpayers under the Publishing Details of Deliberate Offenders regime, which is derived from S. 94 of FA09.  In order for PDDD to apply a penalty must have been charged in respect of **at least** Deliberate behaviour.  That is, behaviour which is intentional and known to be wrong.  

If the behaviour is Deliberate you're way past the line where you're able to argue it was a legal interpretation issue, or that you didn't know it wasn't ok.  You have a right of appeal to the Tax Tribunal, which means if the penalty sticks you either accepted it, or if you appealed a judge has considered it and confirmed that the underlying behaviour was Deliberate.

That said, I'm confused. Seems almost every time I post anything I get downvoted and railed against. And yet the sub is littered with complaints about inactivity; everyone wants to have more conversation, wants more input from the community.

You may not like the things I post—hell, I don't typically like the content of things I share—but shit, all I want is to talk about this stuff with other City fans. Isn't that the point?

I'm a new City supporter. I want to know what you all think. I want input. Does it always have to be so mean fucking spirited? Celebrating the team you love means dealing with everything pertaining to the team, rumors or not. And this is, given its coverage, important in the current climate. So, unless you don't welcome new supporters, unless you want to close up the sub and limit activity to six threads a week discussing why City should have kept Nastasic and the constant discussion of Yaya's decline/resurgence/laziness/dominance, try to be a bit more open to the fact that all posts are made to spur discussion.

Its all to do with finding a sense of belonging, a purpose in life and when some of these youngsters feel like outcasts in their own society, rejected by it without the opportunities they were promised by an education system that tells them they can be whatever they want to be and taking part is what counts, then they're left totally dejected and deflated. 

Who takes advantage of this? Of course the Imams who preach hate and take them under their wing telling them it will all be okay just like the gangsters who tell black and white kids in London that if they're in a gang they got their back.

Of course, this is all pointing towards a broken and ill British society built around material goods rather than a sense of socialistic belonging where people matter more. Families are torn by inheritance and many barely see family members much, too wrapped up in work and partaking in the so called pursuit of happiness when in reality its the path to broken dreams and misery. 

Its easy for the likes of Boris to say this isn't the case but it is. It's easy for him to blame the parents but the fact is its down to politicians like them that have used divide and conquer socio-economic policies on the people for years meaning many don't know their neighbours, blame immigrants, integration is a massive issue and not just with immigrants but native Brits accepting new cultures landing upon their shores, hating those on benefits or the poorest hating the working class for doing it - its all done to take the focus off the government and it plays a big part in all of this.

When decades of government are out of touch then you'll get factions of society that feel disillusioned, neglected and therefore seek extremist avenues in what's nothing more than a cry for help, a way to be heard and given some worth in this world. Of course this doesn't diminish personal/individual responsibility but its not as simple as going 'OMG THEY'RE ALL LUNATICS RUNNING OFF TO BEHEAD PEOPLE'. We're well aware of what is happening. It's understanding why it is happening that is the point. Lets kill the root, not cut the weed and start admitting that its our own cancerous socio-economic policies at home that is partly leading to terrible cells manifesting across the body that is Earth.

The parents are to blame in some regard but many are of those parental problems are problems enforced upon them by a government that sees them as nothing more than economic Labour fodder. They're overworked long hours, kids have less quality time with parents and this leads to them often going off the straight and narrow joining gangs, partaking and experimenting with drugs due to joining the wrong crowds or whatever.

We currently have a shot at top 4. Beating utd this weekend is the first step.

What! Every time there is a conversation about active goal keepers lloris falls in top 3.

Lloris is known to be one of the best in the world.

1--Your argument does not answer the question.

The fact is that some people *do* find the term offensive and it's easy to see why. I'm not (here) arguing about whether they should or shouldn't find it offensive. (I'm not sure it's legitimate to argue, as you do, that people shouldn't find certain things offensive.)

The question is, given that some people *are* offended by the term, if you were to use it in front of them would that be an example of accidental homophobia?

I'd like to add a subsidiary question. Let's call it (1b) for the sake of clarity. When Benedict Cumberbutch used the term 'coloured people' in that interview the other week (the term he and I were brought up to use as the polite term) would you say he was *deliberately* racist? If not, do you agree he was accidentally racist?

-+-+-

2--Your argument does not answer the question.

I'm asking whether something needs to cause offense to someone for it to be considered homophobic. The argument about consensus is different.

In passing, though, I would add that we should be *very* wary about arguments from consensus. The consensus in my lifetime (if it's meaningful to speak of consensus without defining a speech community) was that it *was* OK to call homosexuals faggot--the consensus in my father's lifetime was that it *was* OK to imprison homosexuals. I disagree that consensus legitimised these activities.

Also in passing, your claim that 
&gt;This isn't a matter of debate. They are homophobic.

is slightly alarming. Words have no inherent properties and their meaning is dependent on context.

-+-+-

3--You do address the question here but your argument is faulty.

Sodomy is not a deprecated word. You won't find it marked obsolete in dictionaries and anyone over the age of about 13 knows what it means. It's the accepted legal and journalistc term for homosexual penetration (eg search for its use on the Telegraph website).

You could argue that people using the word 'sod' aren't using it to refer to homosexuality. But you could argue exactly the same about 'gay'.

null,false,stianolini,null,null,null,"My assessment of this list:

Brad Jones: God damn, yes! The guy has never been a worthy backup. I think we have been very lucky not to have got any significant injuries on our goalkeepers for the duration he has served as a backup. Got a few matches in this season, horrible.

Glen Johnson: I have always defended Glen in his time here at Anfield. I think that his lack of end product has been stabilized for being a fantastic outlet and support for our midfield in our build-up play. However, Glen has made it difficult for me to defend him this year. He dwells on the ball way too much, and stops the fluidity in our play. I think his time is done.

Jose Enrique: After twelve matches in over one and a half season, I think he's better off elsewhere.

Kolo Toure: Is turning 34 in a few days, so it probably makes sense to let him go. However, I like him and his presence on the field. He has tons of experience, and has proven himself useful from time to time this season. I wouldn't mind seeing him stay for another season, especially since Dejan Lovren is really struggling to establish himself.

Jon Flanagan: Thought he was good last season. Injuries has kept him from showing us anything this season. Wouldn't mind him staying on, we need Liverpool-lads in the squad as well.

Javi Manquillo: Has struggled to find his place in the team. Wouldn't mind us sending him back to Madrid.

Sebastian Coates: Has never been close to establishing himself in the team, better off elsewhere.

Andre Wisdom: Has had a tough season in West Bromwich, I would like to see him in another loan spell next year. Still young, and has some potential. I think it's too early to let him go.

Steven Gerrard: Already set in stone that he will be in LA next season.

Lucas Leiva: A difficult case. His Liverpool-career has been so frustrating. In the beginning of his time here it was frustrating because he was so poor. And then all off a sudden, he was a completely different player, and totally boss in our midfield. Who doesn't remember the game against Man City when he completely took Yaya out? Unfortunately he got injured just a few matches after that. Has never been the same ever since, but has shown a few flashes of that he still has it in him, before he gets injured again... I have no idea what to do with him.

Joao Carlos Teixeira: Done a good job in Brighton this season. However, will never be anything more than a backup here. Should be better off elsewhere.

Luis Alberto: Same as with Teixeira, don't see him becoming more than a backup. Probably better off elsewhere.

Rickie Lambert: Doesn't fit in to what we are doing. Great story and all, however, should continue elsewhere.

Iago Aspas: Tried to warn Alberto Moreno about joining us this summer. I don't care where he plays, as long as it's not here. I can never forgive that.

Fabio Borini: Was almost forced out last summer, but opted to stay on to fight for his place. I think he should start giving up on that fight.

Mario Balotelli: I don't want him to leave at all. Sure, he doesn't really fit in to what we do, like Rickie Lambert. However, he has been much better lately, and I kind off think that he is best in a strike partnership. I think that it's way to early to give up on him. I think that he and Sturridge can feed off each other great, if given the time to grow.",null,0,null,1426040083,null,0,false,0,cpb04w3,null,t3_2ylnw9,null,t1_cpb04w3,null,t3_2ylnw9,null,null,null,1427693015,null,0,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,0,null

The new website has poor deliniation between stories.  If you look at the Guardian website, they've achieved the cleaner look the BBC are after but each story stands out on its own.  There's that silly little line between each story which makes it look cluttered somehow.  I just find looking at it very 'noisy' and poorly organised.  The times of the annoying videos on the right covers too much of the picture.

The right-hand side of the screen hosts the videos.  I want to choose what I put there.  I go there to read stories, not watch them and I don't want to have to hunt and peck looking for them.

I'm using the BBC website less and less since the new look as it just feels messy and poorly organised.  And it needs to be customisable too - at least more than it is now.

Content as well is more and more aimed at the Light Entertainment sector of the population - people with short attention spans.  I find it now a poor news resource compared to Al Jazeera, The Guardian, or the Independent sites.  I go to the BBC last now when I'm looking at the news.  The editors do have the ability to make a story feel like it's Jackanory than real news.

At the end of the year my cheapest 3rd-party quote was with Admiral at £900 but ItB gave me a renewal of £780 based on my driving scores which were pretty standard. I was expecting it to be much higher!

My 3rd year now with ItB, once again Admiral offered £550 or so but got £440 with ItB. A couple of weeks ago I upgraded my car to a Peugeot 207 Sport worth 3 times as much and I got a £5 refund from my insurance for the rest of the year.

I live in a good postcode with a driveway and adding my mum on my insurance helped lower the price too. Never lie though and make sure if you're driving it that you're the main driver on the policy.

your saying that we need an elite type of cm, one that is truly box to box. Ive read nainggolan as a suggestion on this sub itself and the highlights of what ive seen have been exactly what ur talking about, a *quality* midfielder. kovacic fits the offensive role from what little i have seen (i really plan on watching him more if i get the chance) but i just do not know yet enough quality players.

Why SHOULD it be?

UKIP also kept themselves in the news with constant scandals, debating the word Paki, two TV documentaries and all sorts of other things. 

In summary, UKIP are doing more newsworthy things - and a large percentage of the coverage has been negative rather than positive. 

If they did the same study for Alex Salmond or the SNP I'm sure they'd get a similar result because of the referendum. Their coverage far outweighed their proportional vote share or number of seats - for a good reason because they had a huge impact on UK politics which goes beyond their share of the national vote.

However every time I've watched them recently there's been a gaping hole in the middle of the park, which I feel is partly Fernandinho/Fernando's fault. It looks like they aren't trying to close down the ball.. which results in holes when other teammates do. I felt like this had a glaring effect on these recent games and letting the opposing midfield or strikers find holes in your formation is never a good thing.

Now that's only my opinion but maybe this had something to do with what went on. With Kompany being a senior figure in the squad, he wanted to point it out to them/him.

&gt;

&gt;In [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics), __bootstrapping__ can refer to any test or metric that relies on [random sampling with replacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_sampling_with_replacement). Bootstrapping allows assigning measures of accuracy (defined in terms of bias, variance, [confidence intervals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval), prediction error or some other such measure) to sample estimates.   This technique allows estimation of the sampling distribution of almost any statistic using random sampling methods.   Generally, it falls in the broader class of [resampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resampling_(statistics\)) methods.

&gt;Bootstrapping is the practice of estimating properties of an [estimator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimator) (such as its [variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance)) by measuring those properties when sampling from an approximating distribution. One standard choice for an approximating distribution is the [empirical distribution function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_distribution_function) of the observed data. In the case where a set of observations can be assumed to be from an [independent and identically distributed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_and_identically_distributed) population, this can be implemented by constructing a number of [resamples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resampling_(statistics\)) with replacement, of the observed dataset (and of equal size to the observed dataset).

&gt;It may also be used for constructing [hypothesis tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing). It is often used as an alternative to [statistical inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_inference) based on the assumption of a parametric model when that assumption is in doubt, or where parametric inference is impossible or requires complicated formulas for the calculation of [standard errors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_error).

Now compare that to the thousands killed by drivers each year...

&gt; The plain fact of the matter is that bicycles move too slowly for most out-of-town motorised traffic, and too quickly for pedestrian traffic. Couple this friction with complex situations (blind corners, night driving, busy pavements, pedestrians not retaining 360 degree awareness), and it's no surprise accidents happen.

Indeed. This is why we need real infrastructure like the Dutch.

Because it usually always is.

You're quite right - an arrangement to pay should be reported where a customer is unable to make the full contractual repayments due under the agreement but has reached a concessional payment plan with the lender. It's a bit softer than reporting missed payments, but will still likely have a negative impact on the way a credit profile is perceived. 

If the arrangement is being reported in error, I expect the lender will remove it without making a fuss if you explain the situation. It might take a while to go through though. Lenders can be slow to get changes like these made because they generally report information to the credit reference agencies in a large batch once each month. They *can* get information removed more urgently than that, but will only do so in extreme cases and, I suspect, yours will tell you it can't here (that tends to keep people from pushing the point!) To be honest, unless your desperately seeking to get a mortgage through or something, I'd save yourself the effort and wait.

null,false,Verochio,null,null,null,"Debt is how full the bath is, deficit is how fast the tap's running.

Edit: Full version of the analogy:

* The cold tap is public expenditure (costs of running the country on an ongoing basis)
* The plug hole is taxes and other sources of money for the government
* The tap filling the hot water tank is gross investment (money the government spends on infrastructure)
* The hot tap taking water from the hot water tank to the bathtub is depreciation (the amount of the cost of infrastructure that is recognised in each year to spread the cost of an item over its useful life)
* The speed at which the hot water tank is filling up (input tap - hot tap flowing to bath) is Net Investment
* The speed at which the bath tub is filling up (hot tap + cold tap – plug hole) is the deficit. 
* The speed at which water is flowing through the whole system (tap filling the hot water tank + bath cold tap – plug hole = Net Investment + Deficit) is the Public Sector Net Borrowing
* The total amount of water in the system (bath tub plus hot water tank) is the National Debt

There is also the effect of “timing differences” to understand the impact in any specific period. As another analogy, say you get your household electricity bill quarterly, but you’re doing your household budget on a monthly basis – the sensible way to understand your monthly expenditure is to allocate one third of your bill to each month, even if you don’t actually make a cash payment every month. 

The Deficit and Public Sector Net Borrowing are calculated like your monthly budget, regardless of whether cash has actually flowed in that specific time period. However what actually increases the national debt in any given period is the cash that’s actually flowed – a bit like your overdraft only increases in the month you pay your  bill. The amount of cash that’s actually needed each month is the Net Cash Requirement.

Do you find an equal distribution by gender in each academic subject?  What about when you divide up by grade?  Of course not.

What you see is that in some subjects women tend to dominate and in others, men are still at the top.  And those gender differences may even increase the higher up the education level you go.  Men heavily  outnumber women for instance in postgraduate physics.

Equally, women tend to do better than men in many subjects.  But, the point is that the subjects which men do better in are, for th most part, the ones which pay more.  Engineering pays more than nursing.

I honestly don't think it'd stop anyone who wanted to get into biking from getting into biking - the people who really love bikes will do their A1, A2 or full licence anyway, and at that point the theory test is compulsory. The only people who it affects are those who are going to ride on L plates their entire life, and generally they're not people who love bikes, they're people who need a cheap and simple mode of transport. 

There just seems to be a massive discrepancy between the two - I have a little Honda CM200, which is no faster than a 125. However in order to ride it, I had to do a CBT, theory test, Mod1 and then Mod2 tests, and spend a fortune on training. If it was a 125, I could turn up for a morning riding around cones then go out on the road, without even understanding a single road sign. 

I've saw a guy drop his bike on his CBT, people getting nearly hit by cars because they didn't look properly, a friend of mine even had someone run wide on a corner and across some grass - all these people were passed that day and went on their way. A kid on mine thought that solid white lines on the road meant that it was a national speed limit.

But I don't think it's a forgone conclusion that we would lose everything in the event that the monarchy was abolished. At the very least, even if they keep everything as private property, they'd still get taxed appropriately for having huge properties and from all the profits arising from those properties. More likely is that there would be some sort of deal made to continue taking a share of the profits.

But even if we do lose that income, does it really matter? If the above numbers are correct, we get what, £160 million a year from their profits? The government took in £648 BILLION last year and spent £732 billion. Last year, it was estimated that the government lost £120 billion in tax gap (non-payment, avoidance and evasion), of which £70 billion was tax evasion. Not that I'm suggesting the royals are evading tax, but just putting these numbers in context. Is it worth having royalty for a bribe of £160m? It's subjective, but I don't think so.

Either way, I don't really care if it's a financial loss to lose the monarchy. I'm not against the monarchy because of economics, I'm against them because it is literally the biggest example of inequality we have in our country. How can we talk about the British class prejudice issues when we have a single family held above everyone else as the highest class that none of us will ever touch? The concept of a monarchy is simply ridiculous in a democratic and equal society, it doesn't matter if they seem harmless or benign.

There just needs to be some better means of persuasion - or incentive - in getting a licence. But needing to do multiple tests isn't it. [which is a definite 'captain obvious' comment]

I'm not denying that the CBT needs to push better safety - in whatever form it needs - because of examples you gave. And many of these won't even try to improve their knowledge, making the roads dangerous for themselves and others.  
For example: I had a delivery driver on a moped undertake me on a city centre street at over 30mph, next to a left hand junction I was about to take. If I had been going slightly faster, I'd have been potentially turning as he reached me. As such, he'd have potentially thrown me into oncoming traffic.

The issue that's come about is - I believe - uniquely British. We're the only EU country [that I'm aware of] that allows learner riders out on the road alone. When the 3rd Directive was implemented, they couldn't get rid of the CBT [think of the outcry], and not enough people pointed out the patheticness of the A1.  
And with more and more drivers becoming less attentive to the road - and more attentive to their satnavs and phones - the benefits that the CBT originally brought in are being lost.

Gay also means happy/lively but when you hear a homosexual described as gay you don't assume it means they're happy, do you? That's because the word has multiple meanings and we can easily distinguish between them.

I don't ride in or near London so it's hard for me to comment on the filtering technique there, but certainly in other parts of the country filtering to the right is seen as the acceptable and responsible side and I think you were right in doing that.

It sounds to me like this lady didn't look down the gaps in traffic before she stepped out. Fairly typical of pedestrians in crowded areas - they assume because traffic is stopped, that it is safe to run across and make a break for it. She should have really peered down the gap in traffic to see if you were there before running across.

I'm not sure if there was anything more you could have done. What speed were you filtering at? I always aim to have a speed which makes moderate progress but at the same time not so fast that if a pleb were to walk out, I could stop in a cars length of them.

I do appreciate that drivers can be idiots (and that the outcomes of that idiocy are usually far, far worse). I've seen a 4x4 nearly take out a cyclist with the trailer it was towing. The poor guy would have ended up under *my* wheels if he'd have gone down, and I was amazed that someone could be so stupid. But I really think that cyclists are blind to the stupidity of many other cyclists too.

I recently saw a man lead his two young daughters across a four-way junction on a red light. There is very limited visibility of vehicles approaching the junction, and he made no attempt to check where his daughters were before doing so.

I also had a run-in with a couple riding their bikes on the pavement past my house. I assumed that, if you're cycling on the pavement you would yield to road traffic at any crossing you come to. I pulled into a junction near my house to turn my car around, blocking their path (something I would not have done if they were on the road). They were clearly upset, so I wound my window down to apologise and received a torrent of aggressive abuse.

The reason they were so upset is that I'd spoiled the *race* their sons were having (on the pavement) by causing one of them to stop while I performed my maneuvre.

There are inconsiderate, brainless wankers using all forms of transport, and it really bugs me when cyclists just flat-out refuse to acknowledge that people who share their form of transport might be at fault more often than they think.

null,false,ZeNuGerman,null,null,null,"Ferguson has no idea how incentives work, and this is why Bristol now not only sucks for cyclists, but also for drivers. Ferguson's key idea seems to be ""if we make driving shit enough, people will cycle"". As a result, lanes have been narrowed, affecting not only commuters, but also residents (guess what, idling cars = more pollution, cars avoiding certain street = more traffic in others), AND slowing down the (already shitty) bus system and cabs.  
Here's how you get Bristol cycle-friendly:  
  
1. DON'T rezone any roads, tamper with speed limits etc. It won't change a thing.  
2. INSTEAD, put up large parking spaces around the perimeter of the centre, and FREE park-and-ride buses that deliver you to the centre, in 10-minute intervals or more frequent.  
3. Introduce a congestion charge for driving in the centre, to be waived only for bus drivers, cabs and senior residents of the centre itself.  
  
Making car drivers angry will not dissuade them from driving if there are no alternatives. Making them pay while offering a working Park &amp; Ride system will change habits, thinning out centre traffic while ensuring that cabs and buses can still go at a reasonable clip (screw this new speed limit, pointless), and the lower density of traffic alone will ensure safer conditions for bikers, and better air quality for all.

So then I wanted to know more.

This case was about if you can strike out a claim for financial relief for being meritless. The court said no. This is because, they held, there is a difference between a claim being valued at nil or close to nil and it not having any merit. The Supreme court said that the correct procedure is to apply the section 25 criteria and determine the value of the claim, even if it is very low, rather than dismissing it. The difference between these two approaches is very technical.

The Supreme court has not said her claim has any value. The only thing they did say as to quantum is that the £2.9 million (or &lt;3% of the available assets) she was seeking was far too high. 

She contributed to this family by raising the children without any support (financial or otherwise) from him for several years. That is a contribution which arguably entitles her to some form of payout. That payout is going to be very limited, tied to her reasonable needs. This is not a sharing case and she will (probably) receive less than 1% of what he has made. I reckon the best she can hope for is a modest mortgage free house and maybe a little lump sum on top.

Sounds like people at the beeb (justifiably) don't want to work with him.

&gt; NORAID raised between $3 and $5 million for the IRA...Much of this money went for weapons, either directly or indirectly...and freed up almost £200,000 to spend on arms each year. NORAID was a major source of money for weapons until the IRA began receiving weapons from Libya in the late 80s; previously perhaps 80% of its weapons came from the United States...

&gt; NORAID members also went to Ireland in 1971 to arrange and finance IRA arms purchases in Europe...The US connection was particularly vital in the early years, as the movement sought to establish itself as a viable resistance force.

&gt; NORAID helped IRA operatives find new identities and jobs in the United States, enabling them to escape justice in Northern Ireland...Many NORAID members had condemned the IRA's decision to accept a ceasefire in 1994.

Gave the IRA £200,000 a year (in mid-1970s terms a fortune) to buy arms, was their major source of provision until the late 80s, and even came over to literally traffic arms, and NORAID helped them get away with being tried for the murders of civilians, other paramilitary fighters and British soldiers.

The risk from XC skiing is extremely small. It is less straining on the joints than running from my experience.

Years later I was visiting a friend in NI and we were on our way to a club, when we got to the street it was on we found it cordoned off because of a bomb scare, we waited and then when the police weren't looking we ducked under and carried on to the club - which was packed to rafters.

Swearing and bad language is weird, whats weirder is how its used and how it's meanings change. There's absolutely a broader and very interesting discussion to be had there but I'd rather stay on the subject of homophobic language in school.

I spoke because i've worked around LGBT bullying in schools and my experience and the experience of young people i've worked with is that ""that's so gay"" is used a lot round LGBT young people. They do feel that language tells them that being gay is a bad thing. It's used a lot and it's effects are very subtle but are damaging, particularly to young people.

* In 1969 the Provisional IRA received its first cache of weapons from supporters in the United States, with 70 small arms comprising M1 carbines, M3 ""grease gun"" submachine guns, some handguns, and 60,000 rounds of ammunition.
* In 1971 thanks to Brendan Hughes and other senior Belfast IRA men, the IRA receives its first consignments of Armalite rifles. They include around 100 AR-15 and AR-180 rifles, on Queen Elizabeth 2 (New York to Southampton)
* Later that year Gardaí recover six suitcases full of 5.56x45 Ammunition at Dublin Port arriving on a ship from the US.
* The IRA receives another batch of M16 and AR-15 rifles from supporters in the US
* In 1974, the FBI foil an IRA attempt to buy 100 M16 rifles
* In the US, IRA supporters rob a US Army base of M60 machineguns, M16 assault rifles and C-100's.
* Between 1973 and 1978, after IRA supporters robbed a US Marine base of 500,000 round of[5.56x45 NATO ammunition, they are all successfully sent to the IRA.
* 1979 IRA supporters send a cargo of more than 150 guns and 60,000 rounds of ammunition. including two M-60's, 15 M-16s, a number of M14s, and an AK-47, possibly bought from a US military veteran who served in Vietnam.
* 1981, the FBI set up a sting capturing some of the Harrison IRA supporters group that was believed to be smuggling most of the arms for the Provisional IRA. The group had ordered 350 MAC-10 SMG's and 12 AK-47 rifles.
* In 1982 US customs discover a truck at the docks of Newark, New Jersey. Four members of an IRA cell are arrested. The shipment contained 50 firearms and frequency switches for detonating bombs, to counter British Army jamming of most IRA signals for detonating bombs.
* Later that year five men are arrested for entering USA from Canada, suspected of a plot to acquire ammunition for the IRA, with a ""shopping list"". 200 cases discovered by Police.
* In 1983 the FBI foils an IRA attempt to buy explosives.
* In 1984 An IRA arms shipment is seized on the fishing boat Marita Ann by the Irish Navy. Men jailed in USA and Ireland. Seven tons of arms (known to include M16A2s, MAC-10s, and other weapons), ammunition and explosives procured by the Irish Mob in Boston.
* In 1985 The FBI foils another IRA bid to buy small arms in Colorado. An Irishman is deported.
* The FBI set up a sting operation. A well-known IRA East Tyrone man on the run for killing British forces on the European Continent walks into their traps and attempts to buy Redeye SAMs, M-60 MGs, M-16 rifles, MP5 SMGs and a 11 Level III bullet-proof vests. He later goes on the run, returning to Europe before being captured in 1989 and deported to the US.
* US Customs foil bid to buy rifles from gun dealer in Alabama. Two men who attempted to buy high-powered rifles jailed.
* Detonators for bombs and parts for an anti-aircraft missile system are seized, and a number of IRA members and a NASA Scientist are arrested by FBI after a long covert spying operation that began in 1982. Group of IRA supporters jailed in Boston in 1990 for trying to smuggle a home-made missile system to Ireland.
* 1988–90 FBI foils plot to acquire FIM-92 Stinger missiles on black market in Miami. Several arrests are made.
* Late 1980s and early 1990s: The IRA manage to obtain half a dozen Barrett rifles and other .50 cal Sniper Rifles, all destined for the South Armagh Sniper teams from various sources in the States.

Now this list just covers 10 mins on Google looking for proven US/IRA arms supply. As far as shopping lists go its quite expensive.  Granted some cash came from Libya but most Qaddafi aid arrived in a boat and got seized before it landed.  Granted some cash was raised in Ierland but most of that finance stayed in the country as shipping large amounts of recorded cash about is bound to fail.  It is however the tip of the iceberg as far as arms supply and finance go.  Its just the stuff that got caught.  It was more or less all paid for with dollars via NORAID. 

Posters and rebel songs my fucking arse.

An excellent response to this is to point out the wanker example I have given and to which you seem to have no response. (The other examples are good, too.) Helping people understand how language works and the mechanisms at play is one of the best ways to remove the 'subtle but damaging' effects you talk about. (This from *my* own experience.)

Other approaches encourage vulnerable people to perceive themselves as constantly under attack even when they are not and this does not aid self-esteem.

It doesn't matter if it's crystal clear or murky, if there is a father  who can pay for their child the state will oblige them. So that the taxpayer doesn't have to foot the bill instead.

That is sad I know and should be addressed, perhaps there should be a means test for who gains majority custody until the child is old enough to choose which parent they want to got to for the majority of their time.

*Tuttomercatoweb say Johnson’s representatives will meet with the Italian club this Thursday to finalise an agreement.

Johnson recently admitted that he was in talks with other clubs and made it abundantly clear that he was interested in a move abroad after rejecting a short term extension offer from the club late in 2014.

If he does leave it would bring an almost six year Liverpool career to and end, having joined the club in 2009 in a multimillion deal from Portsmouth – replacing Alvaro Arbeloa who moved to Real Madrid.

It’s unclear just how the loss of Johnson could affect us given he is an experienced head at the back and it isn’t abundantly clear who would be a permanent replacement.

If Johnson does leave, we’d surely enter the summer market for another right-back, although Jon Flanagan is closing in on a long-awaited return from injury.*

If he's out for 6 months and plays in the U21, I can only assume he's classed as a U21.

Reason for this is that in 2012 the 'Reserve team' system was wiped out and replaced with this whole U18 U19 U21 category. The U21's being the most senior team of the academy beneath the first team.

This means that Sterling, no matter how much first team football he gets, could always be dropped and put into the U21.

Plus, our U21 isn't actually a team consisting of 20-21 year olds. They're mostly 17-19 year olds to be honest. Take Harry Wilson, regular U21 player and is 17. So yeah, I think Sterling would class as an U21 player to be honest.

Buuut that's just my guess. Not gospel.

You could argue that because he's registered with the 1st team and maybe there's some written rule that I haven't Googled that says if you play X games a season for the 1st team then you're a 1st team member. I don't know.

3) Yes he has never played in the country and this is relevant again because he doesnt have much experience anywhere else. If he had been playing in England then it would be one less factor to worry about.

Rudy loved Jess a lot (he was a wreck when she got thrown through time) and so it made sense that she forgave him in the end. Future Jess was like ""the creep has to die, he fucks people up"" and it's not like the group hadn't killed people before so yeah, it's weird, but okay, if someone from the future says it has to happen, then it has to happen. 

Wait. I just realized. What if someone had the power to pretend to be someone else? Future Jess's message could've just been another shape-shifter, and they'd never know.

Anyway, back to my point. All that Future Jess said about the baby (that we were shown) was ""you have a baby, and he's beautiful. You have to have sex with the guy or the baby will never exist"". If the baby never exists, so what? I know that what we were shown wasn't the whole message (Jess later on told everyone what they were doing in the future/if they died, and they didn't show us Future Jess saying that), but that's still a little unconvincing. 

Jess panicked a lot when she saw the jumper. And it's not like the baby had some vital part in the plot (or did it? Am I forgetting something here?), so why is it so important that Jess has the baby? 

I don't mean to be rude, or argue or anything x) I just wish there was a better explanation. ",null,0,null,1426076707,null,0,false,0,cpbbvsd,null,t3_2ylulu,null,t1_cpbbvsd,null,t1_cpars9h,null,null,null,1427698567,null,1,false,misfitstv,t5_2s8pg,1,null

I'm a brand new American fan of soccer since this last World Cup, and I've attempted to absorb as much as I possibly could about the sport.  The one thing that throws me off is how to evaluate players when they aren't doing the obvious things like Sanchez, Kane, Lloris, and Toure do.  To make this Spurs-related, it's sometimes difficult to judge performances of Lamela, Townsend, and Rose, because when I think that these players sometimes have a good game, enough other people say differently, which causes me to question what I deem as good and bad.

Parents would talk about the attacks but more as a matter-of-fact, rather than rabid speculation.  There was a lot more concern about local crime.  We were told to be careful, but then again this was probably not an IRA thing given not playing on the street wasn't going to stop an IRA bombing.

The 1996 Manchester bombings is the attack that stands out in my mind because it was *different*.  The level of hysteria was only second in my mind to the coverage to Diana's death (I left the UK in 1998).  Maybe this is just confirmation bias because I could see the damage first-hand (my family would go shopping at the Arndale Centre) and people I knew were affected (I vaguely recall stories from one of my teachers and a classmate's father saying they had to abandon their cars during the evacuation).

null,false,somethingdifferent34,null,null,null,"&gt;There is no argument for trickle down economics; it's a failed long run economic theory. The basic law of capitalism is: when workers have more money, businesses have more customers. Which makes middle class consumers -not rich business people- the true job creators. A thriving middle class isn't a consequence of growth: a thriving middle class is the source of growth and prosperity in market economies.

I don't disagree with that at all. Obviously the very rich cannot and do not spend even a fraction of their wealth, it sits wasting away in bank account somewhere or at best invested, which isn't as efficient as direct economic stimulus by the middle class. But of course it is very much dependent on where you define the difference between upper, middle and working class. The study in question defines the rich as the top 20%, when in reality only the top couple of % are truly rich in the way that stops trickle down economics working.

&gt;There is little/no direct relationship between lower equity and higher GDP per capita growth (GDP per capita is also an appalling measure of social welfare and a crappy method of national accounting) otherwise we'd expect to see countries like Mexico experiencing a boom in its GDP growth rates.

There is more than one reason why income inequality would be high, it doesn't have to be because of lower taxes on the rich. In the case of a country like Mexico, corruption is a major factor. It's also worth noting countries like Finland or Sweden, who have a much smaller population. What works for a country of 4 million doesn't necessarily work for a country of 400 million. 

There is however a lot of evidence over many years that shows that reducing taxes and regulation spurs economic growth, and this is the point I was making initially about why anyone would vote for the ""Tory swines"". 

&gt;There are too many other economic factors that affect GDP per capita growth, it's naive to simply state that low equity has such a large impact on per capita GDP.

I never said that inequality itself causes economic growth, I said that low taxation leads to both inequality and economic growth/increasing per capita GDP.

&gt;And anyway, by the time the money has 'trickled down' it'll have created demand pull inflation which would eat away at any financial benefits gained from the original investment.

&gt; You seam hung up on the technical use of language I'm talking about its effects on people.

In my last post I explained *explicitly* the link between understanding language and how it can have effects on people. You have chosen to ignore this point, like all my others.

&gt;The use of the term ""bitch"" or ""nigger"" is offensive. do you think people are just being over sensitive about that?

Very happy to answer your question but it's only fair if you answer my earlier questions to you first. Why is it so hard for you to do that?

(I guess it's because you know my points are right but you are too proud to admit it. As mentioned, though, I'd rather be faced with a decent rebuttal.)

&gt;At this point i'm assuming this is a joke, that statement is absurd.

No, what is absurd is saying that, to repeat the same example, stubbing your toe somehow has a sexual value.

I wonder how many of those young people offended by the word 'gay' are also offended by the word 'sod'. I am 100% certain it is less. How do we account for this difference? The obvious answer is that most people do not attach a sexual value to the use of the word sod in this context. It is exactly the same for how many people use gay in this context.

&gt;Engaging you further is pointless at this point, you're willfully being obtuse.

I'm afraid you haven't actually engaged me. Every time you have made a point I have acknowledged it and rebutted it. But as is clear to anyone reading, you have not had the courtesy to do the same. What a shame.

As someone who is also traditionally quite left wing, I have found myself being pushed further to the right because of the way in which the left conducts itself nowadays. Vitriol, arrogance, the assertion of subjective assumptions as objective facts, hypocrisy and the general notion that it's more important to avoid offense than to speak your mind. To me, I always considered myself left wing because I believed in the freedom of the individual as one of the pillars of true democracy, but it seems that my beliefs are very much at odds with a good number of lefties who seem to believe that people don't deserve to have their opinions heard if they disagree with them.

I can't stand how so many people on the left cry about harassment and abuse online, only to carry out the same acts or worse to those they disagree with. I'm baffled by people's inability to look in the mirror and start practicing what they preach. One thing I find particularly troubling is the idea of ""free speech with consequences"" that is often used as justification for lefties carrying out acts that contradict their preachings. It's consequentialism that's taken a dangerous turn.

Frankly, I think the left has largely been taken over by young, uninformed firebrands who like to strut about social media acting as if they own the place, flexing their muscles of influence against any who dare to question them. I think these are people who are merely looking for some kind of group and/or culture to belong to and identify with, investing themselves into the politics of which they know so little about and left with an inability to swallow their pride.

I can see the flaws but the NHS and Welfare state are good examples of socialism. I would say that business as it is with a mix of regulation and free market is good. They're not 'dirty words'and can be very good things. Likewise privite companies can be great things as well (with arguments for innovation/competition drive to spur advances). Businesses even like the welfare state, largley because tht means they pay less in wages to the hatred of pure free market thinkers. 

A mix is needed, but there's no doubt we're going over to one side at the moment and it isn't the more socialist side that we used to adore after WW2 and for the next 30 years. 

Pure socialism would  think be a bad idea, same as pure capitalism or pure communism. Eroding the safety net however is just so stupid in so many ways (Inequality has been proven so many times to cause less economic growth). Hell take J.K Rowling for a famous success story, for the other success stories see the unemployment rate going down even with shitty contracts. I'm pretty happy to pay the VAT thatmay go towards helping them bring their income up and I'll be happy topay council/income tax and all the rest. What madman would pay into a system that if he gets fired he/she is going to get treated like shit?

This could probably turn into an essay with alot of empirical evidence that kinda destroys the other side, but the potential lost through not having a decent net is to large for us to ignore. This is a right wing economic theory by the way. Not as far right as Rand etc.. but still right wing. Tbh I think the labels 'right' and left 'wing' are stupid.

Indeed.

I remember being on dialup and I calculated how much I could download on a typical 56K connection which is about 400MB. In those days that was the size of a movie, or a CD rip.

At 1.41mbps you can download about 10gigabytes per day - assuming a continuous connection, and the source will let you maintain that speed for every second all day.

They probably got the ""three days"" metric because the system/client/server timed out and they probably retried the same page several times.

^*11th* ^*March* ^*2015*


Firstly, the old 'waste bin' joke doesn't work online, because these posts are paperless and therefore unable to be put into a wastebin.

Secondly, 'what's the problem with adding a title like any other journalist would?' - because it's not a journal, is it, it's just reddit. Why does no one else title their posts like that? What is the difference between you and them? If someone else writes a post like 'heres what I think of the Clarkson thing' why don't they put a title on it? Is your opinion more informed than theirs, does it matter more, because you are a journalist? What journal do you write for anyway, if you want to format like a journalist, why couldn't you just write a title in your newspaper piece and then link to it?

And it's not really the fact you put a title, its the fact that the title is patronising. By putting 'Lessons in Logic' you're saying that the people you disagree with are acting not out of a difference of opinion but simply because they are illogical fuckwits, and you are in a position to teach them how to behave properly. Like you are gracing us with a lesson on how to behave. It's just a bad choice of title, compounded on top of the fact that it's ridiculous to put a title on a reddit post anyway. If you're going to be a journalist you've got to be careful with the words you chose, not to make yourself sound like a ponce who thinks your readers, or whoever, are just a bunch of idiots.

But that's me, *Ralf Scoop*, over and out.

*EDIT: It was brought to the attention of our editor that there was a mistake in the title of this article. The word 'writing' was misspelled in the sub-headline 'teach an eager young rosy faced journalist a lesson or two in writting'.

null,false,Lyonaire,null,null,null,"To some degree yes however there are a few reasons why united may struggle to rebuild a good team.

1. Less attractive for players. Both last summer and especially moyes first summer united struggled with acquiring the players they wanted. A lot of players dont want to play in that kind of pressure. Rebuilding a team where the fans have unrealistic expectations and expects the team to be be better than it is. Top players want to play in the best teams if possible. Size and popularity of the club means less to players than fans think. Players above all care about how good the team actually is. That as well as wage and location are the biggest factors. United can scream as high as they like about how city is a small club and whatever but truth is city is currently a lot more attractive for players than united is. This problem gets worse and worse the longer theyre out of the cl. Take Reus for example. If you were him why would you go to united? Last summer i saw deluded supporters lining up their ""united 14/15"" starting elevens including players like Reus, Vidal, Kroos, Hummels. A lot of prople seem to not understand that there is no way these players would go to united EXCEPT if United pay them ludicrous wages they wouldnt get anywhere else. Take rooney on 300k or shaw on 100k as an example. 

2. Bad purchases/misuse of funds. Ok if i was an united supporter i would be absolutely furious with the transfers that have taken place in the post-fergie era. some of their transfers make no sense, not that im complaining but im curious wtf theyre thinking. 200m+ spent in 1 year! 160 of them this summer. And yet their first eleven is marginally better than last year. 40m mata on the bench and yet their midfield is extremely unbalanced. 160 million spent and yet valencia is playing rightback while players like evans &amp; smalling are still in the team. Before this window they needed 2 left backs, atleast one centreback probably two, a world class or backup RB three midfielders (1 dm 2 cms or 2 dms 1 cm) rejuvenating old or buying new wingers. As well as offloading a whole bunch of mediocre, often overpaid players. Although thats a tall order, they overpayed for almost all the players they brought in last summer and didnt fix their problems at dm/cm, cb or at rb, also surprisingly few departures led to an extremely big imbalanced and overpayed squad of players. Fans of the club should be worried about how so much money has solved so few issues. Also it seems united looked to buy what was available rather than what they needed.

Council powers have been centralised. Through banning of local council tax rises (additional funding agreed through Holyrood to support central policies)

Regional police forces scrapped in favour of a ""Police Scotland""

Introduction of named (state) guardians for new children.

Social engineering such as restriction on alcohol sales.

I find it ironic that the Scottish government beats the independence drum so hard, yet are unwilling to devolve powers to local regions.

I mean our refusal to allow it on ideological grounds leads to a *massive gap* in the convenience of public services versus consumer services.

The benefits would be incredible. no forms to fill out, massively reduced complexity &amp; waiting times, more accurate tracking, £billions saved in staffing and differing systems- is it *really* worth being opposed to a national database in the age of cloud consumer services?

You'd walk into a hospital, scan your card, and there's be no need to go hunting for medical records because they'd have it all in front of them. Hell, you could have an NHS app that allows you to register than you're on your way to A&amp;E, and based on your medical history and location they could massively improve staff resource allocation.

Imagine how simple benefits, pensions, taxes, and more could be. The database knows whether you're in employment and if you're not, automatically sends you jobseeker's allowance to your bank account, which is also on the system. You retire? Pension is automatic.

You have a single national account, for the national system, and you sign in on gov.uk and see exactly how much tax you owe or are being charged, you can see how many points are on your driving licence, and you can see what benefits you are entitled to, etc..

And if we re-nationalise/centralise the GP system, we can get these benefits there too.

But socially I'm quite conservative, I don't really want humanity to radically reinvent itself through technology or to change our overall public perception. Socially, I don't want us to become like Sweden has become. I'm also pro-immigration and all that stuff. So if I'm interested in the conservation of the norm, I should vote for the Conservatives, right? The ones who are adament on dismantling the NHS and are generally quite anti-immigration. Hmm, that doesn't seem a good way to preserve the norm. So maybe going with someone like the Lib Dems would work to conserve our social programmes without making any major changes to us as a culture.

But then comes the other big issue- liberty. On this, I am quite right-wing. While I believe that we need social safety nets, I believe that it is the duty of the individual to make his decisions and work to support himself, just as long as he is given the same opportunities as others. I believe that the Government should have as little role in the everyday lives of it's people as possible. Generally in the form of less regulation on certain things, and respecting the privacy of it's citizens. I'm all for the decentralisation of government. 

Now, this puts me in a hell of a position. Becuase the Conservatives , Labour, and anyone to the right of them are quite keen on locking down the Internet to stop those pesky terrorists. However, to the left, you have people wanting to make laws to protect them from being offended. On top of that, left-wing parties seem more keen to legislate, regulate and make everything as efficient as possible.

So where do you go? Both sides seem to have no regard for individual liberty. In a way, I prefer the right wing party's versions because they're less scary. It's plain, old fashioned censorship. What we see from many people on the left however is this new, weird form of self-censorship and many of the aspects of SJWs. When you see SJWs and expanding umbrella of people falling into that ideology talk, there's some horrible doublethink, doublespeak and a hell of a lot of self-loathing. I find that scarier, as most of the people involved either don't see it, or don't consider it an issue.

Honestly, if this were a few hundred years ago I'd rather go off and help found a colony than live through whatever is coming.

I think the best case scenario if he leaves Chelsea but stays in  England realistically is United. Sounds bad in the beginning but get this..


For him to go to United, De Gea will have to be bought by someone else. I bet Madrid wants De Gea even if its for half the games. He himself knows he can do better.


United would take him in a heartbeat. After that Cech will not improve United more than they are right now. De Gea is pretty close to Cech in terms of talent so they will still be exactly where they were more or less. 


If Arsenal get him they improve. Liverpool get him and they improve too. Even City can improve all very bad scenarios for Chelsea.


United under LvG will go years without winning the league. Cech at united will be Chelsea's problem only when he faces Chelsea. Plus he will retire sooner than De Gea would have so United will not have Cech or De Gea left.


So its the best realistic scenario. For someone to buy De Gea and for United to get Cech. United fans also value Cech far more than most other fans will as he was one of the main players in all the Chelsea vs United title fights over the years. They are also far more used to players of Cechs calibre and will quietly appreciate him meanwhile if obnoxious Arsenal or Liverpool supporters get him they wont wake up a single day and not jerk it that they have the best keeper in ages zomg he's buffons dad etcetera. They can't even shut up when Schezznezeny gets a half decent game by accident. United are used to exceptional keepers for a long time and exceptional players without being twats about it. They took Mata but its been so civil from both sides. If Arsenal would've took him I bet they would've made Chelsea fans hate Mata purely due to their behavior right now (as difficult as it seems fans can do it). This is why the Chelsea vs United rivalry has mostly been due to competitiveness meanwhile with Liverpool, Tottenham and Arsenal its because of twatiness.

However, I think that because in the past we have overpaid on wages that then have proved to be a waste of resources (Downing, Cole for instance) and the fact that Sterling was awkward about his contract in the past also is the reason LFC don't want to have a wage structure where all of their young players are on astronomical wages.

However, I think LFC should entertain the other side of the coin. Get them on bumper, longterm deals when they're young (for Coutinho, Sterling and Henderson) to try to keep the young core together for a long while to come. 

New TV deal, stadium being extended, new young core of players and young manager on the up. That surely must be a great reason for these players to commit some years to the club. 

Part of me thinks that the club are trying to perhaps heap too much emphasis on the performance based contracts we've heard a lot about over the past couple of years. It could well be that our base wage package is deemed too low by the agents as the incentive based package isn't guaranteed to provide consistent levels of high income.

Prince Charles has a 43% approval rating. Which is a long way off the levels that would allow any reform - Obama was at about the same level when first elected. And as he's already 66 he won't be a hugely long term monarch any way. 

Prince William is ahead of even the Queen in popularity. His traumatic childhood, miltary career and 'normal' wife make him almost untouchable by the media. And any suggestion that he's just a bit boring gets covered by his brother Harry.

Like, say at Coca-cola HQ there was a fight, and there is a guy there that owns the patent to Coca-cola, and he gets in a fight with someone else in the office and smashes their laptop up. And the rest of the executives tell him this is the last straw, and even though Coca-cola is their number one seller, they are willing to fire him, lose the product, and just continue to sell Sprite and Fanta and whatever else. And everyone knows they will lose loads of money without him, that its their most popular product they are sabotaging, but they just can't stand him being a cunt around the office any more, so they cut off their nose to spite their face - no one gets away with acting violent and destroying property in the coca-cola HQ, *no one!*.

So, they announce that Coca-cola is cancelled, there will be no more for the foreseeable future. They tell you to buy Fanta instead. Now, coca-cola is so well loved, that there would be a huge push from the public to get that reversed, to ensure that production continues. 

That doesn't mean that everyone who signs that petition *supports* the destruction of property and aggression in the workplace. Its far more likely that they just *don't care* about some workplace dispute in some office somewhere, but *do care* a great deal about being able to get hold of one of their favourite products. 

Would you really come down on the side of ""Well, we have to all take a sacrifice and go without coca-cola in solidarity for that man who had his computer ruined"" - wouldn't it be a far stronger reaction in your gut to say ""who the fuck cares what happened between two people somewhere? There's a *billion* of us who like this product, are we really all going to lose it just to stick up for the underdog in some argument somewhere in a country far far away?""

Is that illogical? It might be *uncaring* for the guy who got his stuff smashed up, but does it mean the people are idiots?

I would imagine that most people *don't care* if Clarkson hit someone. Lets say you read it as old news, you read somewhere ""in 1997, Clarkson hit a coworker at the BBC"" - what would your reaction be? Probably nothing at all. I doubt you would want anything done. It doesn't really impact your world. But missing your favourite TV show does impact your world. So people are voting for something they care about over something they don't. It may be unloving, but its not because they are all not as smart as you and the OP.

AND ANYWAY, Thats not really my point. I'm saying that being patronising to *anyone* never does any real good.

This is sort of missing the point. No matter what *did* happen, the point is that it's absolutely nothing to do with public dislike or criticism of Clarkson. It's entirely about something that happened on-set, that's been dealt with in-house.
