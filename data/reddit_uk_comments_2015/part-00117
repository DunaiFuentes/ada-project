My oldest friend lives in a totally different part of the country to me now, and our closeness has fluctuated a lot over the last 15 years; right now we're pretty close, but we've gone through periods of not really talking for over six months before. Other people I used to be very close with, but the friendship has faded as we've grown up and gone in such different directions we no longer relate to one another any more. Keeping friendships at a time in your life when such big changes are happening can be hard work and it's not always worth it.

So I have a couple of pieces of advice and a suggestion. Firstly, I think it's a bad idea to have all your eggs in one friendship basket; it's a good idea to have a bit of a range of friends, I think, so bear that in mind. Secondly, think consciously about which friendships you want to keep and which you're happy to let fade; just dropping somebody the occasional text can keep a friendship ticking over. And the suggestion: at your age, most people go home at certain points in the year, like in the summer or at Christmas; be that guy who organises that thing you all do when you're at home, anything from an annual weekend camping trip to always seeing the Christmas blockbuster movie, and make it into a tradition.",null,0,null,1427609146,null,0,false,0,cpua079,null,t3_30n702,null,t1_cpua079,null,t3_30n702,null,null,null,1432075026,null,2,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,2,null

Both act to define separate areas and restrictions for vehicles and for pedestrians, which is entirely at odds with the original point of the scheme.

Also, as you mention, they have been positioned in utterly inappropriate places. In areas where there is pretty continuous traffic, the vehicle in front is always going to define the route and actions of the one behind, and so on and so on. Again, setting the scheme up to fail.

So why have they been implemented like this? 
  
At the national level: Someone saw it working properly in Holland once, brought the idea back to the UK, and submitted it for approval. The first committee to look at it thought might have some merits, but it was a bit radical, so couldn't we just water it down a little for now and see how it goes? They then passed it on to the next layer for further approval... 

At the local level: It was a sexy idea from the national government that offered some money with it.

&gt; Philosophy professor Jack Copeland has questioned various aspects of the coroner's historical verdict, suggesting the alternative explanation of the accidental inhalation of cyanide fumes from an apparatus for gold electroplating spoons, using potassium cyanide to dissolve the gold, which Turing had set up in his tiny spare room. Copeland notes that the autopsy findings were more consistent with inhalation than with ingestion of the poison. Turing also habitually ate an apple before bed, and it was not unusual for it to be discarded half-eaten. In addition, Turing had reportedly borne his legal setbacks and hormone treatment (which had been discontinued a year previously) ""with good humour"" and had shown no sign of despondency prior to his death, setting down, in fact, a list of tasks he intended to complete upon return to his office after the holiday weekend. At the time, Turing's mother believed that the ingestion was accidental, resulting from her son's careless storage of laboratory chemicals

This is a really good Australian courtroom comedy / drama.  It follows a Sydney barrister who defends the undefendable - cannibals, beastiality, lifetime criminals, etc.  While brilliant and highly successful, he's also an alcoholic, drug addict, gambler, womaniser, narcacist, and often speaks his mind inappropriately.

It's really, really funny.  Just watch the first episode and you'll see what I mean, it introduces the characters and setting brilliantly.

The first season is brilliant, but the second season gets too bogged down with an over-arching story arc.  It's still good, but not the brilliance of the first season.

**On 9th July 2012 the High Court of Justice of England and Wales ruled that Samsung Electronic (UK) Limited's Galaxy Tablet Computer, namely the Galaxy Tab 10.1, Tab 8.9 and Tab 7.7 do not infringe Apple's registered design No. 0000181607-0001. A copy of the full judgment of the High court is available on the following link www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Patents/2012/1882.html.*


*In the ruling, the judge made several important points comparing the designs of the Apple and Samsung products:*


*""The extreme simplicity of the Apple design is striking. Overall it has undecorated flat surfaces with a plate of glass on the front all the way out to a very thin rim and a blank back. There is a crisp edge around the rim and a combination of curves, both at the corners and the sides. The design looks like an object the informed user would want to pick up and hold. It is an understated, smooth and simple product. It is a cool design.""*


*""The informed user's overall impression of each of the Samsung Galaxy Tablets is the following. From the front they belong to the family which includes the Apple design; but the Samsung products are very thin, almost insubstantial members of that family with unusual details on the back. They do not have the same understated and extreme simplicity which is possessed by the Apple design. They are not as cool.""*


*However, in a case tried in Germany regarding the same patent, the court found that Samsung engaged in unfair competition by copying the iPad design. A U.S. jury also found Samsung guilty of infringing on Apple's design and utility patents, awarding over one billion U.S. dollars in damages to Apple Inc. So while the U.K. court did not find Samsung guilty of infringement, other courts have recognized that in the course of creating its Galaxy tablet, Samsung willfully copied Apple's far more popular iPad.*

null,false,blorg,null,null,null,"&gt;This is what I don't understand about the whole 'Keep Britain for the British' thing. Aren't we culturally and genetically originally a mix of French, Danish, German, and Scandanavian and even Roman people?

Culturally, yes, but interestingly the Roman, Viking and Norman invasions had negligible genetic impact, probably as they were elites that didn't intermarry with the locals. The only invasion that had a significant impact on the actual genetic makeup of the UK was the Anglo-Saxon one. Genetically the UK is a mix of disparate Celtic groups (who shared culture but were not closely genetically linked- Devon and Cornwall have greater genetic difference than Northern England and Scotland) and Anglo-Saxons.

&gt;THEY came, they saw, they conquered. But while the Romans, Vikings and Normans ruled Britain for many years, none left their genetic calling cards behind in the DNA of today's mainland Caucasian population. That's the message from the most comprehensive analysis yet of the genetic make-up of the white British population.

&gt;The only invaders that left a lasting legacy are the Anglo-Saxons. As well as giving us the English language, the Anglo-Saxons, whose influx began around AD 450, account for 10 to 40 per cent of the DNA in half of modern-day Britons.

null,false,[deleted],null,null,null,"&gt; I only have one question. What happens when I have more than 15k in savings? Can I not put only 15k in an ISA?

15k per tax year - so you could put in 15k now, another 15k (well, it's going up to 15,240) after 6th April, another 15k (or so) after 6th April 2016, and so on. Unless and until they change the rules/allowance. If you want to invest more than this then you may need a taxable investment account - in this case you'll need to think carefully about tax efficiency (using as much of your capital gains allowance as possible, deciding which types of investments to have in ISAs vs taxable, etc) and may need to fill in a tax return.

&gt; Why not invest if I need the money in 5 years?

That's two questions.

Investment is riskier over short timescales because even though you can expect the market to give positive returns over time, it's volatile so if you only have your money in for a shorter amount of time it could be down when you take it out and you could get back (perhaps substantially) less than you invested. 5 years is about the shorted timescale anyone recommends - based on my reading (I think Tim Hale's book covers this) I'd be more comfortable with at least 10 years. If you're looking at just 5 years I suppose you'd at least want a bond-heavy portfolio, unless you have a high tolerance for risk.",null,0,null,1427624349,null,0,false,0,cpudn9l,null,t3_30mn9g,null,t1_cpudn9l,null,t1_cpudfyh,null,null,null,1432076742,null,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1,null

I think opportunities for young NEETs (not in education, employment or training) from ages 14+ are good.   

I teach Entry Level to L1 literacy to them in college and it's great.  

These are teens who are either expelled from mainstream school or they left high school without L2 literacy and/or numeracy.   

Alongside it, they are taught Citizenship and Employability, and it seems to work really well. Especially for the expelled teens. They get a chance to choose something they are interested in such as Motor Vehicle Maintenance, Plumbing, Health and Beauty etc, instead of being forced to do GCSEs they are not interested in, but the deal is, they have to do literacy and numeracy.  

I think this prepares young people for the real world better than being in a mainstream school.   

- They are doing something they like and are interested in (though most hate the literacy and numeracy aspect of the deal)  

- They get work-based experience alongside it, which they all say they enjoy  

- They still end-up with L2 in literacy/numeracy  

- The learning environment is *far* more laid-back and relaxed than a typical school environment, which is fantastic for the teens with behavioural problems who genuinely loathe education  

- They get money for attendance (whether that's a good or bad thing is subjective, but given the extreme issues with attitude and behaviour, the incentive works, and we're strict on it. You waltz into a class an hour late? You're not getting your £25 this week, sorry)  

If I could change some things in education, I would focus on high school.  

- I would want to see a lot more lessons being on Citizenship/Employability/PHSE, or at least try and incorporate these things throughout all curricula more-so, given timetable issues with having more lessons.   

- I would like more teachers to stop having the attitude of ""Do A-Levels then a degree, kids!"" although that does seem to be changing, which is great.

Countries based purely on English traditions tend to be federal, like America and Canada. Those based on Roman traditions, like all of continental Europe are more different still. Scotland is a 'mixed system' meaning it comprises elements of the English common law framework as well as the Roman civil law, and is quite unique in this regard -- most are either English or Roman bases systems (or Islamic). 

Most have written constitutions more clearly outlining the divisions of power between the branches of government, and the relationship between each of their states/regions. Part of the reason the UK has lasted so long is because of its more fluid structure, better able to adapt to changes in society, in light of the diversity of the regional traditions it represents. 

Personally I think we will eventually see federalisation as the devolved parliaments obtain more power and autonomy, but the precise nature of the future constitution is quite hard to say.

My partner and I took our 18 month old boy Eli to the doctors a couple of months ago because we thought he had chicken pox. At the time he had a fever and a rash on his face, so we thought we'd get a second opinion just to make sure.

By the time he got to the nurse at the local GP the symptoms were minor sickness, off his food, restlessness, discomfort, and he had a small rash on his face and groin.

The nurse wasn't happy with the rash as it didn't fade under pressure. As if that wasn't enough, Eli decided to puke as he was stressed and hates the doctors. That was all the evidence the nurse needed, and she hurried off to get a doctor. The doctor did some more checks, then called the local hospital, and what should have been a run of the mill check up quickly became ""SHIT HE'S GOT MENINGITIS"". We were told to skip A &amp; E and go straight to the children's ward, and it was quite possibly the longest 4 hours of my life.

Turns out he didn't have meningitis, it was just a high fever and a combination of events that led to what seemed like the symptoms of the illness. Once we'd established that we were not in fact in danger of outliving our firstborn and climbed down from the ceiling we were speaking with the paediatrician. Turns out she receives *lots* of incorrectly diagnosed cases of meningitis from GPs who simply cannot afford to take a risk and not send the kids showing symptoms of the illness to her ward.

So this is a huge win on a number of levels. In addition to actually ridding babies of this horrible illness, a huge amount of GP and hospital time will be saved. It does leave me wondering if we could have paid to have the meningitis vaccination ahead of it being approved for roll out on the NHS.

Which was quite disrespectful. It's not a problem that they have personal ambition but that they don't seem to include themselves as  a team or talk about themselves as being part of the team first and foremost. They just want to better themselves. Which isn't always paramount in football, whatsoever.

Anyway, since you asked.

[Lukaku link](http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11671/9712353/premier-league-everton-striker-romelu-lukaku-wants-to-move-to-a-top-club). Pretty [average response on reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/Everton/comments/2vr060/lukaku_wants_to_move_to_a_top_club/) and on the[ fan forums](http://www.evertonarentwe.com/forums/threads/stepping-stone.122/). Even if it is his personal view he shouldn't be saying it out loud. Or even letting his agent talk about it. These things should be private and it's simply a matter of respect for all the people around you.

[Chadli and Dembele](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/tottenham-hotspur-duo-mousa-dembele-nacer-chadli-discussed-lokomotiv-moscow-january-move-1491489) were supposedly open to a move in January at the first signs of not playing.
Inclined to think Chadli was just in a strange state of mind following his father though. Either that, or their agents are fishing for new contracts from Tottenham. Either way, not something that should really happen imo.

Dembele, still wants to move with no sign of first team football. Whereas Chadli has stepped up quite a lot. I guess you could argue two different attitudes there really. One that ought to be successful, although maybe still not about the team as such. Even if they're rooted together. There's a recent article on Chadli, and what he's changed fairly recently being at Tottenham, somewhere in the Guardian.

Witsel is older still and [a lot more tactful](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2918610/Axel-Witsel-huge-admiration-Manchester-United-Zenit-Saint-Petersburg-midfielder-love-play-Premier-League-someday.html) in his approach.

These young Belgians either need to shut up or learn the media skills they need to not be pricks to the fans of the teams they are currently playing for. It's ridiculous. Also with the complaining of a lack of playing, it always seems to go straight to the media or through the agent that some Belgian wants to leave to a new club. Don't get me wrong, they're not Ben Arfa scale twats but they really need to at least get in their heads that they appear to be doing everything for the team. And do everything possible to please the new manager. Just thinking you can leave elsewhere to follow your lifeplan doesn't get you anywhere. It's closer to running away and not what leadership characters are built out of. If you want to have the discussions about playing time, have them quietly. We don't want, and no football fan wants, to see players complaining, then playing and it not appear to be based on merit. Because if the player is valuable the manager or club will yield, and whether that's actually good for the team spirit or rather alienating should be obvious.

Imagine being Demba Ba playing behind Torres. But how much did Ba even complain? I realise Torres playing and my comment about value are rather contradictory though.

Oh and forgot to mention, Mirallas has reiterated that he'll leave for CL football several times if Everton don't make it there. It's not like Bale ever said that, even if it was patently true.

Starting in York, head to the coast, coastline buses for the job there. You have the hole of horcum, goathland, Hutton le hole and Roseberry topping (hill and a great woodland nearby) Kirby moorside, gosmont/esk valley and thornton le dale as well, dalby forest if great if you fancy a decent bike ride as well. Brimham rocks will be in your guide and riovoux abbey.

Hit the coast and you have robins hood bay (old smuggler town) and of course famous Whitby. 
Head back to York then head west, ( before you do this if you have a car here I would do a quick trip to masham. Small village to the north of York, 2 great brewery's (blacksheep and theakstons) if thats your thing and a nice river walk to a sweet wood. )

When you go west you have asgarth falls, langstrothdale is great as theres horsehead moor and deepdale nearby as well, theres also malham tarn. If you're on the train from york there's patelybridge which has some nice caves and is a stop on the train.

You then have ribblesdale and ingleton/Ingleborough. The whole areas just great to explore, not exactly off map but some great walks , cave systems and waterfalls around. Your guidebook should go into that a bit. 

I'd then head to settle and then get the train from there to Carlisle (which is the top of the lake district) it's a famous route and sets you up nicely for the next bit.

Then you have the option of heading south through the lakes and Into north wales (all beautiful) or doing a bit of the lakes then heading north for some Scottish isles (Skye etc) 
Which is why I'd do it east to west and not the other way round. 

Also I grew up in York and know the lakes a bit so if you would like more recommendations there that's doable. 

There's lots of walk websites about so I'd just stick those names I mentioned and you should be able to get a good itinerary up. Bit like this http://where2walk.co.uk/list-of-yorkshire-moors-walks/

 - Lee Rigby. While terrible for his family, let's face it, his attacker was an unhinged nutter who used politics as an excuse; you're never going to eliminate unhinged nutters and if you take away one excuse, they'll find another.
 - Glasgow Airport attacks. The attackers had been watching far too many movies; cars don't explode when they crash and the risk of propane cylinders sustaining damage and hence turning into bombs themselves was thought of and resolved decades ago.
   - This led to the first occasion in history where someone was given a medal by the Queen for delivering a strong kick to the testicles.
 - A failed group of suicide bombers whose bombs conspicuously failed to explode.
 - 7/7 London bombings. Which is pretty much the last serious, successful attack that harmed many people - and I doubt encryption would have made much difference either way because they were clearly organised and determined; if they had the slightest inkling that using technology to communicate was a bad idea, they'd have figured out a way around it.

The 'sweet spot' for the vaccination to be cost effective was £3-£9 a dose (according to Bristol uni).

The list price of the vaccine was £75 a dose, and you would normally require top up doses as well. So that's why we have had to negotiate, I don't know what the agreed dose price was in the end, but it does concern me that 'glamour treatments' get pushed for even if the cost-effectiveness is limited, and we have severe deficincies in some areas of the NHS that small funding increases could have major impacts. This vaccine could, to save those 59 deaths, use up to 1% (~£1bn) of the total NHS budget depending on how it's deployed and the price agreed. That's more than the budget for cancer medicine (£340m).

Not to bang on about it, but mental health is severely under-resourced - it gets about 10-13% of NHS funding despite being around half of reported illnesses of people under 65, and in terms of 'burden of disease' is estimated at 23% - having a total impact estimated at around £105bn. Known treatments and programmes (IAPT and CBT) have been shown to be cost effective, and actually pay for themselves in reduced disability spending and increased tax receipts from those in work, yet funding is falling in real terms because we need to bring in all these 'Oh look how awesome the NHS is' treatments.

Then again, it's totally possible the deal struck meant we are only paying a small amount for these vaccines... I just worry with all the noise and campaigns 'pushing' for these vaccines to be brought in, we've got an election coming and the government has folded and has forced the NHS to agree a price that will not represent good value and only deprive other parts of the NHS from much-needed treatments and therapies.",null,0,null,1427629684,null,0,1427629880,0,cpuenh9,null,t3_30nmfs,null,t1_cpuenh9,null,t3_30nmfs,null,null,null,1432077216,null,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8,null

As I say we only have a couple of residential properties. One is attached to my house. I've also cut my house down in size to make another (house went from being 5-bed, to a 3-bed house plus a two bed apartment). I also built another house pretty much from scratch out of an old derelict outbuilding.

So yeah, I've not really been doing the traditional buy-to-let thing so to speak. My bro's first house is the only traditional BTL one.

---

The current government have massively relaxed the planning laws concerning barn conversions and converting outbuildings. They want new houses, but not new *buildings* on the green-belt, converting derelict/underused buildings fulfills both these criteria. So if you can buy a smallholding with a few outbuildings then convert them to extra dwellings that can be quite profitable as many investors don't seem to have cottoned on to this yet.

Properties in nice rural locations also tend to be desirable for commuters and attract better quality tenants.

You're also bringing new housing onto the market rather than taking houses out of the market, so this way of doing things is a bit more ethical as well IMO.


---

As another example, some friends of mine just bought a small-holding next door to me. It's set on 5 acres of land, with a [6-bed farm house](http://i.imgur.com/6SQxpDM.jpg) (three are loft-rooms). Plus enough outbuildings for three more houses which already have planning permission ([this is one](http://imgur.com/b9deyWg), there are two more of similar size). The views are pretty amazing, overlooking the vale of belvoir with [Belvoir castle](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Belvoir_Castle.jpg) visible in the distance.

The farmhouse needed a ton of work doing and there's a busy road nearby, but he only paid £360k for the lot.

To get the money together to buy the place he had to sell one of the outbuildings to his folks. They'll be converting that one to live in.

As a BF noob, I'm going to assume/suggest that you would start with the Eighth Doctor - probably the most popular starting point.

His earliest tales were in BF main monthly range, starting with *Storm Warning*, and did have an arc, but it wasn't particularly strong (at least, not at first) and you could hop in and out without losing too much. However, by time you get to *Zagreus*, things start getting tied up quite strongly into an arc, and, although you can skip one or two, you need to do it in order from then on really for the rest of his main range stories.

However, there is then pretty much a complete break when it come to the *Eighth Doctor Adventures*, which introduces a wonderful new companion, and is far closer in style to the NuWho TV episode style, so that's another good place to start, and you'll not miss anything. These are all pretty arc dependent though, and you really should go them in order. 

The four *Dark Eyes* sets follow in from the end of the EDAs, and although you *can* start with the first on those, just knowing that something bad has recently happened for the Doctor, I wouldn't recommend it.

As for Tom Baker's BF tales, well as long as you've seen a few of his TV stories, so that you can picture his mannerisms etc, then you can start with the BF sets without any great problem.

Yeah sorry. Carlisle is at the top of the lake district, if you were to go south through it, it's pretty decent as you are at the less touristy area first before you cross over to the south lakes bit which is where Kendal and the tourist areas are (still amazing and at your time it's not peak season). The weather can be a bit worse here and there's a few peaks I would avoid if the visibility is bad (striding edge/helvellyn springs to mind) but the whole area is well documented. 

Sure I mean not everywhere will be possible but its good to just have the names so you can work.it out. 

I'm 25 and still head back occasionally on weekends, I just work.further south now. 

Monteys is a rock cafe at the top of micklegate that is a good place to start early on as they do 2 for 1. Head down hill and you get the artful dodger which usually is a bit of alt crowd acoustic set. That whole street is generally cheap drink offers (trebles for.singles etc). And at the bottom you have a few clubs. Further in to the centre you have the hop, the habit, evil eye, blue fly bar. Studenty bars are the graduate, yo1, lowther (next street from stone roses), keystones.

Special mention to the willow. Even at 22 you will feel a bit old in there, its a very cheap night at a restaurant which has a small dancefloor which has a bit of a cult status with students just for how messy it gets. One to hit later in the night.

And the duchess. If you're there on a sat has a ""lollipop night"", cheesy pop etc that's really popular. Also do other nights and music throughout the week.

For breakfast or coffee can I recommend coffee culture? Run by an aussie lady and her Brit husband, great coffee, great breakfasts (all day so ideal for hangovers) and really chatty. The girls that work there are chatty and are all about the same age. You would Probably get some great info from them as well.

null,false,FezojT,null,null,null,"&gt;Personally I would reallocate a significant amount of time away from social sciences, art and the like (making them more voluntary in nature) and instead use the time to teach basic things like how to fill in a tax form, how loans and contracts work, how to get a job and how to develop skills that will enable that.

I'd disagree. I think an education is more about having a well-rounded set of transferable skills than it is about having task-specific knowledge, and I really don't think specific lessons in how to fill out tax forms will be all that helpful. For example, I remember being told how to wire a plug in school, and yet I don't actually remember how to rewire a plug. It's not something I need to know by heart though, because if I need to rewire a plug then I can pull up the instructions in seconds using the internet. It's the same deal with tax return forms etc.; I feel that it would be a huge waste of time and money teaching kids how to do things that they can (easily) teach themselves to do. 

All we really need to give kids is a solid grounding in English, maths, science, IT to an extent (though currently the IT curriculum is basically glorified secretary work, I think the technical and problem-solving skills introduced in more computing-orientated lessons would be more valuable). If we teach kids how to do those things really well they can become almost anything. All the other lessons are there to give kids a more rounded understanding of how the world works and I think it's probably much more useful to have that macro-perspective than it is to channel the ""everything else"" into the specifics of tax returns etc. It would be deathly boring and would lower the standards of our education system.

I think skills is the way to go. Academic students should be taught to high standards in things useful in skilled work; more advanced maths, high level usage of English, how to construct and defend an argument, some level of computer programming etc. For the not-so-academic, the skills focus should be on 1) primarily making sure they are capable of using maths and English at an appropriate level. If they cannot, they will always be held back in life. 2) what skills are in demand? What do you enjoy doing?

The 'artistic' subjects should remain as they are now: mandatory for first years, and optional for the last few years. Rather stereotypically, my brother who studied art is now stuck working at Costa Coffee, because there simply isn't enough demand for his skills.

Another MAJOR problem with education at the moment are the tests: in school you are taught the skills to pass a test, not the skills you would use in a real situation. Even my teacher admitted when I questioned her about the usefulness of the skills I was actually being taught, that it is a bit of a mess of a system at the moment.

This isn't helped by the fact that the government is constantly changing the education system, which is extremely infuriating from the teachers and schools point of view.

And last but not least, languages. I was told I would have to pick a language as one of my GCSE's. I simply flat out refused saying I wanted to study my more 'important' subjects, instead of wasting time (in my opinion) on something that I would completely forget after a few years, which is exactly what happened with my brother after he passed his French GCSE: he knows fuck all about French now.

I'm interested as to why you think that though.  

I think it is. Contact time between young people and teachers is a lot, and teaching/education is an awful lot more than simply ""Learn this topic and subject.""  

Interpersonal skills, employability, citizenship etc. don't necessarily have to chew-up teaching time, they can be easily incorporated within lessons. Something that should happen a lot more often. For example, you can learn something about employability within a great English lesson where you learn something about English. When I was teaching a class on how to extract information from different texts, I used detailed job advertisements as a couple of the examples the learners used for the activity. It can be as simple as that. They've not only had an English lesson and kept to the topic, but they also learned how to read job adverts properly so they can apply that skill should they write a covering letter or something.",null,0,null,1427633745,null,0,false,0,cpuflhv,null,t3_30os0f,null,t1_cpuflhv,null,t1_cpufhjv,null,null,null,1432077731,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

null,false,Hitman__Actual,null,null,null,"I nearly applied for a job working with jobseekers like this recently. 

I decided against it because I thought I'd keep encountering the attitudes that it seems you're encountering, but I did think how I would communicate to them, and decided that I would take the tack of stating no-one else is going to help them how they want to be helped. 

I'd use myself as an example ( as I'd be their tutor) and tell them I don't go home and worry about them getting jobs, I go home and worry about keeping my own job. I'd probably also expand on a few other ""anti-work"" opinions I have, depending on how the audience was and if I thought they'd recognise our similarities.

Basically I would try and make them see that almost everyone thinks their job is shit (I mean, you have to leave home ALL DAY, EVERY WEEKDAY!!! It's ridiculous!) and they all feel the same as these people do, but they get on with it anyway.

It sounds like they think they're hard done by, I'd try and make them see we're ALL hard done by. 

I've never actually put this into practice as I didn't go for the job, but I am a learning and development trainer, so I'll use the same tactic. 

For example our company released a new policy on managing stress. In the training for it, I openly state that ""this policy has been brought into place just so when a staff member eventually commits suicide from stress, the CEO can point at the policy and say ""look, we manage stress, we have a policy for , we tried, we really tried...."" 

That gets rid of the elephant in the room of ""the directors dont *really* care about this"" - I tell them, no they don't, they're also just scared little boys trying to protect their jobs, even all the way up there in the rarefied air of ""The Board"".

Our job, as managers and staff at the lower end of the business, is to make use of that policy in the best way - let people have time off for stress, call in sick, and then when the phones don't get answered and you get shouted at for your attendance figures, use the policy yourself! Take it in the disciplinary meeting. Use it as a defence against mismanagement! 

So I try and get them to accept their fears, and then work aroudn them anyway.",null,0,null,1427634430,null,0,false,0,cpufs82,null,t3_309xrf,null,t1_cpufs82,null,t3_309xrf,null,null,null,1432077820,null,1,false,UKJobs,t5_2seb3,1,null

null,false,mediocrity511,null,null,null,"The benefit cap is purely political though and it doesn't make practical sense. Benefit payments are based on what it has been decided that people need to live on and it's not massively generous. The things that push total benefit amounts up are things like there being no affordable housing, large families and additional needs such as disabilities. 

Now housing benefit is set at levels that should allow claimants to rent the cheapest 30% of properties in an area. Not 30% of the available properties though, 30% total. So because rents are rising year on year, less than 30% of places on the market will cover HB, then you consider that many landlords won't let to benefit claimants. For large families on benefits there may be no suitable housing that is any cheaper. So when their benefits are cut, they can't afford the rent and become homeless. The council has a duty to house them because children are involved, so they end up in emergency accomodation. Hostels and B+Bs are exempt from the benefit cap and are much more expensive than normal properties, so the bill to the taxpayer increases. So we pay more to disrupt the lives of children who are unfortunate enough to have a lot of brothers and sisters or disabled family members.

A cap would only make sense if it could encourage people to change things within their control. You can't shrink your family once it exists (unless you and your partner split up and take a few kids each, so actually the cap may incentivise family breakdown) and you can't control the rent levels as that's set by the market, the disabled and sick can't magically become well.

Most of the countries you list there are generally smaller and more homogeneous demographically.  

The HoL being unelected is important given the nature of the UK constitution, and particularly how relatively weak the judiciary are, although arguable there is a trend already towards more power to them developing as this branch continues to punch above its weight. In places where there is an elected second chamber, I would bet that the Supreme Courts in those countries have the power to strike down legislation -- this is not the case in the UK. If you tweak the scales in terms of legislative authority, the balance will tilt back towards the independent judiciary to even things out. 

But ultimately it doesn't make too much difference, and people shouldn't over or under champion any particular approach. A balance is likely to arise in practice if not necessarily in any theory, and in well established democracies the changes tend to be incremental rather than completely radical. This is probably because order is very hard to achieve but very easy to lose.

null,false,Edward_Elgar,eng-manchester,Greater Manchester,null,"&gt; My proof is my children. I have seen my son constantly imitating television when he watches it. Which is why TV and Film is heavily vetted when he is allowed the time to watch it.

So, no proof then. 

I have a cure for cancer, my proof is that I've seen it with my own eyes. Anecdotal arguments are no arguments at all. And I'm sure you have seen your kids imitating the TV, thats called using your imagination, not changing what they believe is acceptable. They might watch fireman Sam and pretend to be a fireman, but they're hardly running into burning buildings.

&gt; So is alcohol age restriction a guidance or to stop children drinking it?

No, because that different. There is no proof video games have any effect on children that might lead them to harm others. Where as there is proof if you give your child alcohol that it will damage the child physically. You can't compare physical reactions to psychological ones. Also, I'm just telling you what the law is, not whether I agree with it or not, so I don't see what point you're trying to make.

&gt; I can tell from this your not a parent, because when you become a parent you soon realise that children imitate everything. Your actions, language, behaviours etc.

I never denied they don't imitating things, I denied it changed their view of what is acceptable behaviour. Millions of children see people get shot on the TV everyday, more so actually do the shooting in video games, so, why are these millions of children not going out shooting people or stabbing people? 

You seem to have got mixed up with what your argument actually is. You said it changes the child's perception on what is acceptable behaviour, now you're talking about imitating. Those are two different things. Me pretending to be a bird would mean I'm imitating a bird, but me jumping of a building and trying to fly would mean that I've got a deluded perception. When your kids watch power rangers and then pretend to be a power ranged, their view of what is acceptable behaviour has not changed, they're just playing and using their imagination, as any parent should know.

Can you prove to me that their behaviour definitely changed because of what they saw and not because there was an external factors? Did you eliminate external factors?

If you can't use the official stream please do consider donating to the great cause through other methods. My Twitch streams get recorded automatically so I'll also hopefully be able to distribute a video of the match later to those who need it. Though I'll probably only do this if LFC don't provide one through their website.

&gt;Emerging association between addictive gaming and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
AvivAbraham A WeinsteinWeizman
CURRENT PSYCHIATRY REPORTS , 2012, Vol.14(5), p.590-597

&gt;There is emerging evidence of an association between computer game and videogame addiction and ADHD. This is indicated by the occurrence of psychiatric co-morbidity between ADHD and gaming addiction. Both disorders seem to share a common mechanism of reward and sensitization which is mainly mediated by dopamine. Preliminary evidence seems to suggest that videogames activate the brain’s dopamine reward system, resulting in significant dopamine release during exposure to videogame playing. This system is mainly controlled by brain dopamine neurotransmission but other neurotransmitters, for example serotonin, GABA, and glutamate, may play an important role in its regulation. There is further genetic evidence linking genes associated with dopamine release and turnover with internet and videogame addiction. Third, there is evidence suggesting that methylphenidate, a common stimulant treatment for ADHD, may be beneficial also for excessive internet and videogame players with ADHD. A proper understanding of the common psychological and neurotransmitter mechanisms underlying ADHD and computer game and videogame addiction is therefore important for appropriate diagnosis and pharmacological treatment of individuals with both conditions. Future studies should illuminate the psychobiological mechanisms for both conditions and explore new trends and developments in the diagnosis and treatment of both conditions.

&gt;The impact of prolonged violent video-gaming on adolescent sleep: an experimental study
By:King, DL (King, Daniel L.)[ 1,2 ] ; Gradisar, M (Gradisar, Michael)[ 1 ] ; Drummond, A (Drummond, Aaron)[ 3 ] ; Lovato, N (Lovato, Nicole)[ 1 ] ; Wessel, J (Wessel, Jason)[ 1 ] ; Micic, G (Micic, Gorica)[ 1 ] ; Douglas, P (Douglas, Paul)[ 1 ] ; Delfabbro, P (Delfabbro, Paul)[ 2 ]

&gt;Video-gaming is an increasingly prevalent activity among children and adolescents that is known to influence several areas of emotional, cognitive and behavioural functioning. Currently there is insufficient experimental evidence about how extended video-game play may affect adolescents' sleep. The aim of this study was to investigate the short-term impact of adolescents' prolonged exposure to violent video-gaming on sleep. Seventeen male adolescents (mean age=16 +/- 1years) with no current sleep difficulties played a novel, fast-paced, violent video-game (50 or 150min) before their usual bedtime on two different testing nights in a sleep laboratory. Objective (polysomnography-measured sleep and heart rate) and subjective (single-night sleep diary) measures were obtained to assess the arousing effects of prolonged gaming. Compared with regular gaming, prolonged gaming produced decreases in objective sleep efficiency (by 7 +/- 2%, falling below 85%) and total sleep time (by 27 +/- 12min) that was contributed by a near-moderate reduction in rapid eye movement sleep (Cohen's d=0.48). Subjective sleep-onset latency significantly increased by 17 +/- 8min, and there was a moderate reduction in self-reported sleep quality after prolonged gaming (Cohen's d=0.53). Heart rate did not differ significantly between video-gaming conditions during pre-sleep game-play or the sleep-onset phase. **Results provide evidence that prolonged video-gaming may cause clinically significant disruption to adolescent sleep, even when sleep after video-gaming is initiated at normal bedtime.** However, physiological arousal may not necessarily be the mechanism by which technology use affects sleep.

&gt;Media Violence Exposure and Physical Aggression in Fifth-Grade Children

&gt;The association between physical aggression and media violence exposure is robust and persistent; the strength of this association of media violence may be at least as important as that of other factors with physical aggression in children, such as neighborhood violence, home violence, child mental health, and male gender.

&gt;The effect of violent video games on aggression: Is it more than just the violence?
By: Adachi, Paul J. C.; Willoughby, Teena
AGGRESSION AND VIOLENT BEHAVIOR  Volume: 16   Issue: 1   Pages: 55-62   Published: JAN-FEB 2011


&gt;Experimental research has shown that playing violent video games produces higher levels of aggressive cognition, aggressive affect, physiological arousal, and aggressive behavior (in the short-term) than nonviolent video games. However, there are two major limitations with these investigations. First, the majority of experimental studies that have compared the effects of violent versus non-violent video games on aggression have failed to equate these games in terms of competitiveness, difficulty, and pace of action. Thus, although the common finding is that violent video games produce higher levels of aggression than non-violent video games, other unmatched factors beyond the actual violent content may be responsible for the elevated levels of aggression. Second, previous experimental studies have tended to use a measure of aggression that may also measure competitiveness, leading to questions about whether violent video games are related to aggression or competitiveness. After describing these two limitations, how future research can address these gaps in the violent video game literature, and why this research is important, are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

null,false,[deleted],null,null,null,"&gt; If you have a non-locking folding knife with a length of less than 3"" then you can carry it without reason, This is because stabbing a person with a folding blade and actually causing any damage is quite difficult.

No, this is not the reason (and is at best highly debatable, IMO). The reason is that parliament wrote the law to exempt any folding pocket-knife with a cutting edge of less than 3in. We know from the transcript of the debate at the time that the issue of locking blades was discussed but there was no decision to restrict it to non-locking blades.

In a weird court judgement it was decided that a locking folding pocket-knife could not be a ""folding"" pocket knife (despite the everyday meaning of the words, the standard terminology used for folding knives, and other similar examples such as the definition of a ""folding umbrella""). Even more stupidly it was later affirmed that this must have been the correct interpretation because parliament could have changed the law if it had disagreed.

So, basically, it was never legislative intent, nor was it decided that non-locking folding pocket knives were less dangerous, but we're stuck with it now because it's politically impossible to loosen the law on it, however sensible that might be.",null,0,null,1427637627,null,0,1427637884,0,cpugsai,null,t3_30n6kh,null,t1_cpugsai,null,t1_cpuf5yo,null,null,null,1432078291,null,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2,null

Where is the catastrophe? You don't seem to understand how economies or societies work. On the social front, if you cut basic services to people who need them while shifting money to the richest, you exacerbate inequality. 

On the economic front, how is consumption going to be maintained in the longer term, do you think? Propping up the housing market continually won't do it. Eventually, inequality will have to reverse or the UK will have to start manufacturing things again for export.

We do really try to put the emphasis on finding what's right for you than hyping up cult products. People here are obviously going to have their favourite HG products, but we try to discuss why people like them than, ""OMG SO AMAZE BUY IT OR UR A LOZER"".

That's a certain kind of failure to pay attention to your children. If the parents reasonably think it's suitable for *their* kids then fine, but age ratings exist because graphic depictions of violence in particular can cause the more impressionable kids to act out or get the wrong idea, in subtle ways. Look at how CoD or GTA desensitise, incentivise violence and discourage empathy. It's the gaming equivalent of junk food for children. I wouldn't let them consume too much of those in comparison to more healthy, stimulating games or other media.

That said, parents are sometimes busy, over-worked, and have the wrong impression of games - and then proceed to get shocked by the actual content. Perhaps games stores need to do a bit more to make parents stop and think. For instance, putting 18+ rated games in a shrink-wrapped *adult* section, making it clear that these are not games intended for children.

Unfortunately, there are also some parents that won't pay attention even to that; and it shows in the other ways they parent, too.",null,0,null,1427638869,null,0,1427639121,0,cpuh8gp,null,t3_30o37i,null,t1_cpuh8gp,null,t3_30o37i,null,null,null,1432078503,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

What you're suggesting is already something good teachers do and is already what Oftsed want teachers to do: engage learners by using their interests to teach the more boring topics. It's not very explicit but a school would certainly not get graded Outstanding if this never happens.   

You also have to take into account time management and inclusion. Off your example, there might be one learner or more who has zero interest in fashion, so this wouldn't be inclusive teaching (again, that is bad).   

In a perfect world, all of the interests will be implemented in the lesson but it isn't entirely possible a lot of the time.  

This also enters the ""hidden curriculum"" territory. Life skills for young people: sometimes in life you have to do things you don't like or find interesting.   

Teaching them about loans is boring, but only on paper. A good teacher can be innovative and take advantage of interactive technologies to make such a topic more interesting so that learners are engaged.  

I once had a class of 18-year-olds who found extracting information from texts boring as hell, but they all shared an interest in drugs and violent crime.

null,false,Edward_Elgar,eng-manchester,Greater Manchester,null,"&gt; You are falsely representing my argument, a cure for cancer or the proof of god is completely irrelevant and pointless to the discussion of parenting.

No, you've just completely missed the point. The point wasn't about cancer or God, it was about anecdotal evidence not being able to prove those things.

&gt; Parenting is about dealing with various shades of grey, i could post a years worth of videos on youtube to show you my children imitating the behaviours and actions they see from people around them and the media they consume. But what's the point? Its wildly known within parenting that this is the case, so why prove something that parents already know?

Again, I never denied they won't imitate. I'm denying it changes their perception of what is acceptable. Can you not read?

&gt; Scientific studies, ok sure. Give me a few minutes while i use my wife's university access (Good thing she is a lecturer in child development ;) ), but in the meantime here are a few to keep you entertained:

Oh God, I don't know if you'r being serious or not. That's pretty cringy.

Let's begin with your your telegraph link.

&gt; The link between television viewing and behavioural problems could be down to sleeping problems or a lack of physical activity, researchers said, while some children's temperament could influence their screen-watching habits.

Okay, so there is external factors that may be causing the behavioural problems, that might not be the TV. So, we don't actually know if its the TV or lack of physical activity, great. Remember what I said about eliminating external factors first? This is why psychologists don't call this evidence, but rather theoretical research.

&gt; It could also be the case that it is what children watch on television, and not how long they spend watching it, that influences their behaviour, they added.

Okay, so not perception then? Everybody already knows activities influence a child's behaviour. But you claimed it influenced their perception of what is acceptable. Like I said, there is a different between imitating something, and doing something. A kid may watch a soldier on TV and then pretend to be a soldier, but it doesn't mean he would or would want to actually shoot somebody given the chance.

&gt; Those who watched more than three hours' television per day were 1.3 per cent more likely to have behavioural problems such as stealing or fighting by the age of seven than those who watched television for less than an hour per day.

Okay, so no real link between the TV and behavioural problems then as the Doctor herself admits: ""This important study suggests the relationship between TV and video games and health is complex and influenced by many other social and environmental factors.""

Well, thats that one debunked. Did you even bother to read it before linking it?

Okay, your second link actually isn't a link at all. Its an article that links to other links. One of which links to a study based on children's exposure to violence, such as as abuse and bullying, not television or video game based. In the two links that actually do link to a supposed link between video game and TV violence, in one of the links you need a subscription to view the ""evidence"" and the other ""evidence"" you have to buy for $12 ahahah. Who would have known that you have to buy evidence. So, clearly you've not read that, unless you did buy them and do have a subscription, in which case you should have known better to not link something people can't access to without buying.

Okay, your third link and I do actually know this one. Not only is it questionable since the research is 40 years old, but it's been criticized numerous times by psychologists, which your very article even states: However, apart from ethical objections one might raise, such experimental studies have major limitations in terms of their artificiality . They have been criticized for a lack of 'ecological validity' since they were concerned with strange behaviour in strange settings:

So, what we have here is a 40 year old study, in an artificial scenario that has been criticized on numerous occasions. It's hardly compelling evidence, the reason psychologist try not to use artificial scenarios, is because the volunteer will act of what is expected of them, rather than acting naturally. Nobody acts naturally when they're being watched or in a laboratory with strangers they do not know. Hence why psychologists try to make scenarios as normal as possible. 

Now your last link.

All you had to do was look at the conclusions.

&gt; Conclusions TV but not electronic games predicted a small increase in conduct problems. Screen time did not predict other aspects of psychosocial adjustment. Further work is required to establish causal mechanisms

Deary me. Even then the increase was is so small that it could just come down to genetic factors (some people born with the warrior gene exhibit more aggressive behaviours), the mood of the child that day or home influences. Hence why this subject is so hard to test and why every time it is it's constantly criticized and why in the conclusion it says more research needs to be done.

Read your own damn articles before linking them and calling it evidence.

EDIT: Don't change the links with extracts from your links. Actually provide the links so we can all see the evidence for ourselves, not so you can conveniently emit parts that contradict your evidence. Put the links back like it was before you edited.

It's possible that your skin was better during your vegan diet and in the sunshine. Lol, that's not taboo to discuss here at all!

My skin was the best it's ever been when I lived in Seoul, had plenty of sunshine and ate no dairy or red meat. The water there might have also made a difference as it was softer and had no added fluoride. 

Have you tried any other oils to OCM? It might be that sunflower oil is not for you. It was absolutely not for me.

That sound like someone from the council adlibbing. You are both liable.

&gt;Spouses and partners who live together are jointly responsible for paying the bill.

Because you were not a student at the time, council tax is due. But there is no situation where one person is more/less liable. The payment is simply due.

&gt;Legal demands for payment

&gt;Your council can ask a magistrate for a ‘liability order’ if you owe them unpaid Council Tax. This is a legal demand for payment. The council’s legal costs, eg for hiring a lawyer, may be added to the money you owe. You’re allowed to go to the court and give your reasons for not paying if you want.

&gt;If you receive a liability order you should speak to your council or your local Citizens Advice bureau http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/ about your options.

We don't blame the book store if, whilst a parent isn't paying attention, a child goes off to read Fifty Shades Of Grey. Simultaneously, it isn't deemed TV's fault if a child watches something inappropriate after the 9 PM watershed; that once again falls down to the parents. The same can be said of the gaming industry.

Also, when you have games like Grand Theft Auto or Battlefield, what do parents and people honestly expect? The game has war in its title, so it's probably going to be violent, or a game with ""theft"" in its title is probably going to involve crime - maybe drugs, etc. That's just common sense! 

Finally, I'd argue against CoD or GTA desensitising violence. Violence exists in the real world and stories, be it in a game or a book or a movie, are often fictional but based upon real events. GTA has gang crime, yes, but can't a child also see about that on the news? Call of Duty has war, true, yet children can go online and watch ISIS beheading people online.

They said budget cuts would destroy growth and leave us exposed to years of stagnation, also untrue. They used these predictions to argue that austerity was ideological, being used only to decrease the size of the state. Yes austerity will increase inequality, but it was not done on an ideological basis. So again, most of this video is proven bollocks. If you think what the UK economy is currently experiencing is a catastrophe, may I direct your attention to mainland Europe. 


Its pointless to compare this to past UK recessions as never before in history has our economy been so concentrated around finance, with a recovery happening alongside huge problems within the euro-zone, our largest trading partners.


Debt to GDP ratio is a pointless stat, it was always going to increase. Since 2010 our deficit/gdp ratio has gone from what, 11% to around 4%. Books almost balanced. Yet here the UK economy sits with the highest developed country growth in the world and incredibly low unemployment. So again where is the catastrophe caused from austerity? There are inequality problems which I’m not denying, but these pale in comparison to what would happen if confidence was lost in our ability to service the debt. These arguments against austerity where shown to be completely bogus. In 4 years austerity will end and any sensible government won’t bother running surpluses for the foreseeable future.


So again, if not right now, when should the UK government attempt to balance the books.

It also gives me a big lump sum so that I have a really good amount saved for a deposit/emergency fund. Because I have it all in accounts I could go and buy a car with it if I wanted. The fact is the interest on it is tiny and you won't notice that you are paying it off at all really. I'm paying around £70 a month, which is straight from my paycheck. 

At the current rate I won't pay it off by the time it times out in 25-30 years. I think you'd be foolish not to. No one treats it as actual debt.

Instead of bringing together nations we have closed the door on anybody even past allies. Just like you I want reform of the European project to fix the core structural problems which cripple the eurozone and project. Instead of negotiations we have flipped the chess board before even starting and complain about being left outside.  Given the state of geopolitics Britain runs a real risk of being a loser.  Look at history we have always punched above are weight time to look outwards not inwards.  We been able to punch above are weight due to joining together with allies setting a agenda in which other nations follow due to combined grouping.  
Instead we have this view of the world which is out of touch with reality caused by some outdated views of the world. Financial sector design was American and we have the ability to shape Europe once again. Instead we have tossed it away due to some rose tinted glasses nostalgia. Lack of leadership from west minster is outstanding along with the lack of vision. Current people in charge have no experience or even skill in negotiations or vision.   
Wasted opportunity from David Cameron, only the Lib dems showed some vision. 

Many elements of British life which is run by unelected officials.  I would like to see more transparent process so lobbies groups can't hide or impact choices. Immigration is being used as scapegoat against doing structural reform we require and want to kick down the road.  About time we rein in the power of the financial sector and fix the tax system across every EU state. 

As for what reform I want?
Things to be clearer what each arm of the EU does and for the eurozone to fix it own house.  With the EU coming together on copyright laws and other laws so business is easier to do across every border.

It's hard to disentangle the various factors and not always terribly useful to consider them in isolation. South Korea is a small territory, and I would guess relatively homogeneous compared to something like the UK or even more dramatic an example, the US (large territory, high diversity). According to Wikipedia: ""South Korea is one of the most ethnically homogeneous societies in the world, with more than 99% of inhabitants having Korean ethnicity. Koreans call their society 단일민족국가, Dan-il minjok guk ga, ""the single race society"".""

&gt; I don't know the answer but, aside from Germany, I suspect it has more to do with how when the system was put in place the rich and powerful or the intellectual elite of the day wanted to remain somewhat in control of the ""commoners"" rather than because it's a superior way to organise a government.

This most certainly is an aspect to it, although I wouldn't paint it in such black and white terms even though elements of such depiction still persist today. These systems were to an extent 'put in place' but they constantly develop and evolve as time passes. It is part of what makes the 'Westminster system' such a democratic marvel -- despite current public discontentment, a tremendous amount has been achieved, and it continues to change.  

Bicameral, or even multicameral systems, allow for a greater variety of interests to be represented. This is meant to better balance the risks inherent to governing with an emphasis placed too greatly on any one facet of society, including 'the people.' Too much emphasis there can lead to anarchy, too much emphasis on the upper classes can lead to plutocracy, too much emphasis on a monarch can lead to tyranny, and so on. 

&gt; A second question to consider is if a unicameral system is 'better' but only if you remain small then is remaining one large big state even desirable?

Absolutely, but it's a rather big 'if' and rather hard to assess conclusively without bias given that what constitutes 'better' is incredibly subjective.

This video - which your view on him is based upon - isn't all that Mark Blyth has come out and said since 2010. [He's also written a book on the subject](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Austerity-The-History-Dangerous-Idea/dp/019982830X) in which he goes into more detail than just about anybody as well as writing and [speaking publicly](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Mark+Blyth+Austerity&amp;page=&amp;utm_source=opensearch) about austerity and a bunch of other things, as academics tend to do. 

Next, austerity isn't ideological? Who exactly do you think you're kidding? You think I'm going to even humour you on this one?

Debt-to-GDP is a pointless stat? You're the one that brought up 'balancing the books'. The coalition government made deficit reduction and paying down the debt its raisons d'etre. If the books are almost balanced, then, as they pledged they would be by now, the debt-to-GDP should be falling. [Why has the opposite been happening, then?](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/government-debt-to-gdp) 

The deficit being at 4 per cent is still not a budget surplus, which Osborne pledged by now to the House of Commons in 2010 (along with a safeguarded triple A credit rating). 

If cutting government spending balanced the books and paid down the debt then we'd be in surplus by now with a falling debt-to-GDP level. That's necessarily what would have happened. Instead, the recovery came three years into the coalition's term in office, which is bizarre considering the theory backing up austerity predicted growth would emerge as soon as the cuts were *announced*. 

You've fallen for the government's story hook line and sinker. There wasn't ever any danger of the UK becoming Greece. The UK isn't part of any single currency, the UK is in control of its monetary and fiscal policy, the UK was never in any danger of defaulting. There was no urgent need to balance the books at all.

Then perhaps an exercise where the children work out each others' strengths - who's good with money in the class? Who's good with people? 

Pretty much everyone is good at something, it's a matter of getting people to think about what they're good at and how that relates to career choice.

When I interview people sometimes I meet adults who have never thought about matching what they like and what they're good at to what career they should pursue.

I also think it's very important to teach people the difference between a career and a job. Even if a person's priorities are not the conventional career, getting someone to think through how to develop their skills and look for work if their priorities are, for example, 1) being able to take the kids to and from school and 2) very short travel distance that person will still do better planning a career than just grabbing for the first job that seems right.

For instance my mum stayed home to look after my sister and me when we were young but used the time to get further qualifications. When she went back to work these helped her career and she went from part time teacher to Deputy Head in 11 years (really fast for those days).

The starting point for managing a career is to start thinking about managing a career. So for a youngster what would you like to do? If you're not sure, explore and develop self-awareness. It's not good to have a young person in the situation of ""I don't know what job I want to do so I'll do an archaeology degree because I've always been good at history."" Because that leads to the situation where the person still doesn't know what they want to do but they're older, in debt and may feel they have to work in any job just because it no longer makes sense to keep being a student.",null,0,null,1427647396,null,0,false,0,cpul14a,null,t3_30os0f,null,t1_cpul14a,null,t1_cpugthc,null,null,null,1432080292,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

Do you understand what guilt by association is? Because it's a fallacy, and it's what you're doing right now.

There were plenty of peaceful muslims at the rally, just because there were some flag burners and bad people there, doesn't mean he agreed with their opinions.

If you go to a Christian march there will be plenty of people with radical extreme views, it doesn't mean you agree with all of them.


&gt;You seem to be expecting everyone to bend over backwards to avoid putting two and two together.

You're putting two and two together and making 5. I'm examining the evidence and drawing conclusions from them, you're speculating. 

Just because he's a muslim doesn't mean he's a terrorist who willingly signed up his daughters to ISIS, if you've seen any of his very emotional pleas for help maybe you'd be less heartless. 

&gt;You've not touched on the fact that he failed to report his daughter missing 

He reported her missing at midnight on the day she went... She's a 16 year old girl, not an 8 year old, that's a pretty normal amount of time. 

&gt;or the theft of the jewelery.

You're not going to immediately notice jewellery going missing ffs. 

&gt;The only conclusion that I can draw is that she went with his blessing, you want me to think it's all a series of coincidences? Bollocks.


He's a muslim therefore he's a terrorist, got it.

He attended a Muslim rally about people insulting Islam. Stop saying ""Islamist"" because it sounds more terrorist-y.

As I've pointed out this rally was not organised by Choudary.

No he didn't, as I quite clearly point out in my OP. You just got so angry reading that DM propaganda piece that you stopped even looking at the pictures.

Guilt by association fallacy.

&gt;Chants with the Islamists

He chanted ""praise god"" with other Muslims, so he's a terrorist?


&gt;Do you think he just got lost and wandered into the rally?

No, he went to a peaceful rally.

Our 2010 deficit was £150bn, it was always going to lead to an increase in debt/gdp over the parliament. Has debt/gdp increased for France over that period, yes. How about the US, yes. Spain, yes. Germany, yes. For almost all developed nations who had budget deficits or who were within the euro-zone sphere of influence, it has increased. It was always going to increase, regardless of the overoptimistic predictions made by governments. It would have taken huge levels of growth not seen in any developed nations over the period to see likewise. May I remind you these predictions where made before the Eurozone debt crisis climaxed, which hampered UK growth. Osbourne’s predictions which were ludicrous, mean nothing for the justification for austerity. Despite austerity the UK is the fastest growing developed economy in the world, which you conveniently ignored. 

And if you really care so much, debt/gdp ratio is now predicted to fall in the UK for 2015-2016 period, justifying austerity by your mark. The economy is predicted to grow at a rate which is high enough to lead to a decrease in the ratio. What matters most for explaining this parliament is the deficit/GDP size, which has more than halved over the period. Most of the video turned out to be bollocks, don’t see how you can deny that. The facts for the US and UK economies speak for themselves. 

Finally when should we balance the books, for a third time?  You keep implying it isn’t prudent right now, why not. Growth is high, unemployment is low, inflation is miniscule, and consumer spending is high enough to counter decreases in government spending. When should we lower deficit/gdp. There was never a risk of the UK defaulting, but servicing the debt is such a huge drain on UK finances. In 2025 when we’re not servicing debt to the tune of £50bn a year the full benefits will be seen.

What you're saying here is he's a muslim so he's guilty.

Not even remotely true, as proved by the fact I'm an atheist and regularly criticise religion.

Really, do you have a source for that? Business investment and GFCF are approaching 2007 highs.  ""GFCF increased by 6.8% from 2013, which is the largest annual growth since 1998 (6.8%). Business investment also grew by 6.8%, the largest annual growth since 2007 (8.1%)"" If not for the collapse in the oil investment they would be even higher.

Those record debt levels are of course unsustainable, but they allow us a crucial time frame. The argument in the video which I assume you believe is to not enact austerity alongside low consumer demand. We don't have low consumer demand. So this gives us a window to balance the books, this will allow us to increase government demand when we need to (when consumer spending falls). Obviously the real wage increases are mostly down to oil prices, but so what. That means that any problems caused to ""incomes"" of low earners from austerity, will cause smaller effects on their real incomes as inflation is so low. 

Did austerity really put us back 2 years, or did the culmination of a euro-zone debt crisis alongside an exposed financial sector cause problems in confidence. The USA has experienced similar levels of deficit reduction to the UK, so that's a pointless example. They cut their deficit from 8.4% of GDP in 2011 to 2.9% of GDP for 2014. Why did their deficit cutting not put their recovery back 2 years? Our economy is not weak so balancing the books seems prudent.
	
The rest of your post is a mash of half problems, mostly exaggerated. Real catastrophe is unemployment levels in Greece, and Spain, stagnating growth and young population simply leaving. Nothing in the UK compares to those, and fixing them can start in less than 4 years’ time when our spending is balanced, and crucially, our cost of servicing the debt lower.

No, they should accept that in a free country every ideology is open to criticism. If you haven't noticed Christianity is ridiculed constantly on TV and radio but those Christians don't feel the need to go out on the street. Muslims haven't quite figured out the fact that their particular ideology is not a special case.

&gt;You know that Rabbi's went to parliament over trolls posting criticising of Judaism online? You know what happened there? MPs tried to move to get internet asbos on the people doing it.

And guess what I don't agree with that either. Unfortunately hatred towards Jews is a sensitive issue because over 6 million were systematically murdered less that a century ago right on our doorstep. Doesn't mean I agree with it but it is an issue Europe is still coming to terms with, that is a fact.

You can try to paint the protesters as innocent Muslims if you want but I am sorry nobody is buying it. Just look at the group! You think anyone with decent morals would be happy to stand shoulder to shoulder with a group that campaigns for a worldwide Islamic caliphate and all of the evils that come along with it?

&gt; Finally when should we balance the books, for a third time? You keep implying it isn’t prudent right now, why not. 

Actually that's not what I'm saying. What I'm saying is that continually cutting doesn't make an economy better off. (That's why Help to Buy happened, for instance.) And that there wasn't any need for the UK to imitate Greek austerity to appease the markets. 

As for the deficit, Osborne admitted himself in 2010 that what had to take place was a sectoral rebalancing. If you have a massive financial sector that is guaranteed against failure by public funds, then [you will have a perpetually high deficit (or worse).](http://www.lrb.co.uk/v34/n04/andrew-haldane/the-doom-loop) 

The root cause of the deficit spiking to 10-11% wasn't the government—it was the banks. Cutting public spending isn't going to solve a private sector failure. You get this, right? 

What I'm basically saying is a couple of things: (i) Blyth knows what he's talking about; he wrote the *essential* book on austerity and (ii) this government doesn't have the *country*'s interests at heart. It serves the interests of big business, banks and the rich. That's why its policies have been what they have.

2. You keep repeating that Choudrey did not organise the rally without providing any source at all to back up that claim. At the very least Choudrey promoted the rally and the only other names i've seen as possible organisers are also islamist groups. 

3. You keep repeating the phrase ""guilt by association"" and maintaining that he was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.

4. Your whole argument in the other thread revolved around repeating ""peaceful rally"", ""guilt by association"", ""daily mail circle jerk"" and calling people ""cunt"", ""moron"", and ""brainwashed"". Dont be surprised when you get downvoted. 

Edit - I also want to say that I never said he was a terrorist or even that he has done anything illegal. I was saying this provides good evidence as to the type of man he is, the type of beliefs he has and the type of home his daughter grew up in. 

Edit 2 - [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D83LagCZvZ4) showing Abase Hussen with the group organised by Anjem Choudrey, taking part in flag burning. Pretty conclusive.

Web development is the least demanding task there is, and even a fairly shitty computer can keep up with compiling moderately complicated code with barely noticeable latency. 

However, don't underestimate how useful a laptop is when you're working at university and at home. Having a laptop which allows you to work in a larger variety of places makes the experience a lot more social. 

My advice, don't buy anything new until you've worked out whether it will actually be useful. In most cases you won't know this until the end of year 1.",null,0,null,1427651990,null,0,false,0,cpuncce,null,t3_30p4u2,null,t1_cpuncce,null,t3_30p4u2,null,null,null,1432081451,null,10,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,10,null

&gt;While Austerity reduces the deficit a lot faster than growth, surely long term it does more harm than good? 

Medium term I would say definitely, longer term I think depends on future resource allocation. I'm unsure how much a 10 year blip will impact longer term growth, I am however sure that a targeted investment approach and consumer incentives could go a long way to addressing the loss. These future investments and consumer incentives (tax cuts perhaps) could again however come to blows with an ageing population or a recession meaning that yes, I think we could potentially be facing a lost few years. 


&gt;Assuming we eliminate the deficit and run a small, but consistent surplus which is used to repay debt, and not just service the interest a lot of government departments will have to continue to impose strict budgets, correct?

Budgets could and arguably should rise and fall with tax revenue. The problem is many departments often require larger increases in spending which are not addressed by tax increases. Budgets needn't be strict, we the electorate just need to learn to vote for tax increases rather than effectively making our governments run deficits.   

&gt;Wouldn't this mean, as a whole, the GDP and wealth of the country shrink for quite some time? Infrastructure investment would be limited, departments cannot expand when required and we'd become over reliant on the private sector to plug service gaps?

Not necessarily, countries have a huge swing in their levels of state spending, with correct me if I'm wrong no obvious correlation to growth. Ireland has cut state spending hugely and still seen rapid growth and Greece is in the opposite boat. Infrastructure is a big issue for the UK and is as we can see with HS2 and Crossrail still being invested in heavily, so I think perhaps the government has made allowances for this. 

&gt;is it better to take the shock of cuts and let real growth/government spending rise later on?

This is the question, clearly the Conservaties and Labour think yes and if we leave aside the emotional argument you can understand why, cuts far from being devastating only appear to have had a minor negative impact on the economy, most importantly with regards to employment. So if the country can handle is why not take the fastest and most secure route to a balanced budget.",null,0,null,1427652011,null,0,false,0,cpuncqf,null,t3_30lxcs,null,t1_cpuncqf,null,t1_cpudc4l,null,null,null,1432081456,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

I see the benefit of having a 2nd home in the capital, especially if you spend a lot of time there, but someone has to foot the bill and I am happy for the government to do this if it isn't fiscally irresponsible.  If there isn't a huge discrepancy between the cost of putting them up in a hotel and paying a 2nd mortgage, then let them put the money into a property which will benefit them later in life.  You can't expect to attract the brilliant minds this country needs by expecting them to live in shitty dormitory conditions.  People will refuse to do it.  Pay peanuts, get monkeys. 

MP's are paid a laughably small amount when you consider the seniority and responsibility that their job entails - there has to be some benefit as not everyone that gets into parliament comes from money and we need to encourage those that don't.  If that means paying a second mortgage then do it and consider it a pension for a life dedicated to the public where the MP's skills could have earned them much more in the private sector.  

I think it's Japan where they are paid a salary befitting their seniority and not allowed to take 2nd jobs.  It seems to work very well.

End of the day, parliament is a big old beast.  It will cost money to gather people from literally all over the country to debate and vote on issues relating to the whole country.  Providing it is done responsibly, fuck the cost (to a degree).  It is the cost of a fair and open government, representative of the people and a drop in the ocean compared to other areas of spending.",null,0,null,1427653900,null,0,1427654512,0,cpuoc6f,null,t3_30p8ns,null,t1_cpuoc6f,null,t3_30p8ns,null,null,null,1432081920,null,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9,null

null,false,swug3,,Right Wing Conservative,null,"&gt; Britain is losing influence due to choice over being forced out. Instead of coming to the table with ideas we have closed the door. Instead of bringing together nations we have closed the door on anybody even past allies. Just like you I want reform of the European project to fix the core structural problems which cripple the eurozone and project. Instead of negotiations we have flipped the chess board before even starting and complain about being left outside. Given the state of geopolitics Britain runs a real risk of being a loser. Look at history we have always punched above are weight time to look outwards not inwards. We been able to punch above are weight due to joining together with allies setting a agenda in which other nations follow due to combined grouping.

This argument would stand if the leader of the EU commission, Juncker, didn't believe in further integration and expansionism. He is a federalist, he only cares about making the EU more supra-national at the detriment of what other nations think. If you seriously believe that Britain is solely at fault, then you have bought into the Pro-EU propaganda with too much gusto.

&gt; Instead we have this view of the world which is out of touch with reality caused by some outdated views of the world. Financial sector design was American and we have the ability to shape Europe once again

You believe in an idealistic dream if you think Germany will ever allow Britain a chance to shape the EU. Seriously, they don't want to hear what we say, as what Britain wants to change is a fundamental to the EU project. This leaves no room for anything really, until one side backs down.

&gt; Current people in charge have no experience or even skill in negotiations or vision. Wasted opportunity from David Cameron, only the Lib dems showed some vision.

Is this the same Lib dems that promised an EU referendum in 2005? but now, since the wave of anti-EU feeling has grown, have changed their tack because they know they will lose.

The same Lib dems who couldn't argue efficiently when the head to head went on between Nigel Farage and Nick Clegg?

Give me a break. 

&gt; Many elements of British life which is run by unelected officials. I would like to see more transparent process so lobbies groups can't hide or impact choices. 

As are many elements of EU life, has it occured to you that the most powerful man in the EU is unelected, that the only people who formulate any policy are unelected officials. The MEPs aren't much better, since they are lobbied all the time by different pressure groups and no one bats an eye.

&gt; About time we rein in the power of the financial sector and fix the tax system across every EU state.

And there you have it, your mission. A one size fits all policy doesn't work. You believe in an old and outdated view that the EU has. Something that clearly failed when the Eurozone crashed and showed that every Eurozone member, would break the rules they all agreed to.

&gt; Time to learn some history get rid of this little englander view.

Your arrogance is astounding, it truly is. Your end goal is for Britain to become passive and just let the EU tell us what to do. Which is ignorant, arrogant and down right stupid.

I have to disagree with you there. They banked everything on reforms to the FPTP voting system and that belly flopped in slow motion.

null,false,nillis,cnty-scotland,Glasgow,null,"I think it's a very interesting idea. After all - stuff like small claims court and employment tribunals, originally set up to allow lay-people to bring claims, are now very much filled with lawyers (not that this is necessarily bad? It's a different issue altogether) and during my time at a pro-bono law clinic I've seen that having representation definitely gives parties an advantage.

In a perfect amazing world I think nationalising the legal service would be great! Access to Justice would probably improve as more voices could be heard in court (opposed to largely those with money now). I could go on and on about how unfair I think the legal system is but I don't really feel like spending my Sunday night talking about it.

But realistically I just don't think a nationalised legal system would work for one reason: Conflict of Interests. Right now it's very difficult (and basically unethical) for a firm to represent both parties in a dispute. I mean there are some firms that do it and get around it - but the national legal system would be too big to really deal with it. You could try and set up 'chinese walls' to prevent different lawyers finding out information about certain parties but it'd only take a few unscrupulous individuals for this to fail (and with this many people working for the service it'd probably happen). 

There's also a conflict of interest because what does the national legal service lawyer do if their client wants to launch a case against the government?  The government isn't going to be happy seeing as they're essentially paying to launch a case against themselves (and then will then need to pay more money to fight it). This could easily result in certain types of cases being discouraged or banned and could limit solicitors - not ideal (obviously the legal system gets funding from the government now - but a national legal system is very different).

I think a more realistic option is to look at legal aid and not cut it so much. Offer it for more types of legal disputes and also bring on more types of alternative dispute resolution like mediation. More education about people's legal rights and the court system will also help to level the playing field. It's not enough to give people legal rights - you also need to make sure they know what they are and how to enforce them.

This is pretty brief and is definitely very biased as I'm only a student working at a pro-bono clinic so I definitely support widening people's access to legal representation and addressing access to justice issues - but realistically I don't think a national legal system could work - no matter how much I wish it would.

I'm a manager, and also in the public sector - so there is hope! You'll have a bullying policy, and a grievance policy I think, these are very useful to getting everything on the record and independently assessed.

Progressing this depends how you feel, if you think just drawing a line and moving on is the best way then that's really respectable. Maybe even communicate that you're drawing a line, and want to just continue with business as usual.

Should the manager continue bullying though - and the casual sneaky stuff is always they worst, most petty. I'd maybe note it down, the date/time and what was said to you. You can then use this in any meetings with a union friend present: ""On Monday 30th March - you said.............. I feel this was aggressive. Is it how you meant for it to come across? What did you mean by it? How could I have done my work differently? (do they even offer you a solution, or are they totally ranting at you?!)""

Your biggest strength is putting it all back to the manager, and asking for some honest answers. They'll feel very awkward if you suddenly run through a list of examples and ask them to comment on them one by one.

Do you have any protected characteristics? Bullying someone for their religion, gender, sexual orientation etc. is totally unlawful, and you'd have a claim of harassment / victimisation if he continues. 

I'd have a think and see how you can best progress - can you apply to transfer jobs even, might be good to take a sideways step to another role and gain more experience too. Who knows, you might return in the future as the manager yourself :P

In terms of termination, you'll never be wrongfully fired I can be sure of that, so don't let any threats or suggestions that this could happen drag down your morale. As a public sector employer there's a duty to go above and beyond standard equality legislature - any grievances or issues should be thoroughly investigated before considering any sort of sanctions / dismissal procedures.

Here's a good guide on [how both employee and employer should be behaving](http://www.acas.org.uk/media/pdf/o/c/Bullying-and-harassment-at-work-a-guide-for-employees.pdf) in the case of bullying and harassment. Might give you some ideas.

Whereas if you have a lot of members in relation to the number of ministerial posts you will have a good number of back benchers who know they are unlikely to ever become a minister so they are more willing to vote as they really think is good/beneficial to their constituents.

Also, with only 60 members it would be really difficult to properly staff all of the committees, most members would have to sit on a really large number of committees, which could result in sloppier work being done.

Yes! So, if it's cheap enough like in the case of Mizon's Snail Recovery Gel, or Superdrug's Serum I don't mind just buying full size. The ladies at my local Boots are really nice about me trying the testers and taking a little pot in to try at home. As long as the sample is reasonable not the whole thing. I also have a local store near me that freely give out samples of French skincare, so I try them through that. For Asian Skincare, I order the samples, or if I'm lucky try them through freebies given through orders.

null,false,Firefox7275,null,null,null,"A vegan diet can be done really well or really poorly depending how well researched it is, what supplements you take and whether you prep all meals from scratch or use convenience foods.

The average UK omnivorous diet is deficient in several nutrients: when people switch to a totally different way of eating they often plug those gaps with different foods or with supplements. Sometimes they replace those deficiencies with different deficiencies but this may well not show up on the skin in the initial stages.

Whilst dairy is a culprit for some, don't be too quick to demonise it. Dairy is not all created equal, processed cheeses are quite different in composition/ additives/ digestibility from plain live yoghurt. The mineral calcium is needed in balance with other nutrients such as vitamin D and magnesium. Many westerners have this balance completely off. Serving sizes are highly relevant, as are companion foods.

Weather and season are relevant to skin: for example research shows winter skin is lower in ceramides. Also many in the UK are deficient in vitamin D in the winter time - again this links back to diet. You cannot get all your vitamin D from sun exposure, none at all between October and March in fact.

Ultimately wholefoods are a superior source of nutrition than pills and potions, because they supply the right balance and they are what humans evolved eating. See the NHS healthy eating guidelines, any additional advice for vegetarians/ vegans, also veggie/ vegan charity websites.

If you intend to avoid even one food group - dairy, oily fish, other seafood, whole eggs, grains - you should discuss this with your family doctor or a registered dietician. You may well not see your true skin type until you can consistently address balance and variety in your diet - that means vitamins, minerals, essential fatty acids, protein, carbs, fibre.",null,0,null,1427659186,null,0,1427659410,0,cpur3a1,null,t3_30oruq,null,t1_cpur3a1,null,t3_30oruq,null,null,null,1432083216,null,2,false,SkincareAddictionUK,t5_32evd,2,null

Ethically, universities should not have these toppling hierarchies, they should be examples of good conduct in society and I think these income differentials are unjust. They also make for a world that we dislike, where we have gated communities of the very rich and cheap labour, often imported and exploited, doing all the jobs that we don’t want to do.”

This sums up my experience as what is called an ""early career researcher"". I.e. a PhD student. Frankly, I'll be running in the opposite direction as soon as I get my pre/post nominals, never to use my PhD in all likelihood. Academia is, basically, fucked in this country. Shit pay, shit work conditions and, especially in the humanities, totally under-appreciated. 

However, what seemed to be touched upon but not explored was that the deep issue for the humanities is that we're seen as superfluous wafflers who **contribute nothing to the economy**. This is a cultural issue not just in academia, this is modern Britain. Economy, economy, economy. If it doesn't make money, it's worthless. You are your balance sheet, your property portfolio, your earning potential. Humanities are not easy to quantify in their benefits and so are looked down upon by government, by universities, by people in general a lot of the time.

Partly of course, the humanities have been really quite bad at telling people why they are important, which fosters the attitude above, and there seems to be *an* attempt to justify the humanities inside universities in the desperate competition for money. This is called ""Impact"", and seems to crop up frequently on forms. ""What Impact does your research have?"".

No it won't.

I worry about things like this. Nothing a cyclist can do will have any effect of people not looking. And if someone can't see you while you following the law I doubt they should be driving. And nothing puts people off cycling, and more people in cars that stuff like this.

That said....

If your data is not this granular, please instead could you tell me how many motorists have been caught in whatever reporting periods you have for 2014 and 2015.
    
    2. Of those motorists identified in Q1, how many have been dealt with by way of a Speeding Awareness Course?
    
    3. Of those motorists identified in Q1, how many have been issued a Fixed Penalty or Court Summons?
    
    4. Is it Avon and Somerset Police's policy to take action, be it SAC, FP, or Summons, on all motorists exceeding the ACPO guidelines for enforcement of &gt;24mph, or do you operate a discretion system?
    
    5. How many times have you operated a mobile speed camera van or other speed enforcement system such as motorbike based speed traps that resulted in SACs, FPs, or Summons (i.e. not simply happened across a speeding motorist in the course of routine traffic patrol or other duties, and not community speedwatch style programs where only warnings were issued) in a 20mph zone since Sept 2014 or for the years of 2014 and 2015 to date, whichever information is more accessible.

Why not reduce the limits to 15mph, or 10mph, that would reduce the number and seriousness of road accidents even more.

30mph is, in my opinion, and the opinion of central government via the national speed limit, an appropriate speed for built up areas in the absence of exceptional or unusual circumstances to warrant a reduction, balancing the needs of the economy, the environment, and drivers, vs the risk of accidents.

I actually agree that many of the side streets, that you wouldn't usually go down except for access, should be 20. But the main thoroughfares such as A432 Fishponds road, and the others I mentioned, should be 30.

I've been dropping my fiancee to UWE Frenchay for dissertation work the last few days, then picking her up in the evening, so 3.5 miles through what is now almost exclusively 20mph zones. I have stuck religiously to those limits, as much to make a point as anything else.

I've been beeped at many times, and twice nearly witnessed accidents as frustrated drivers perform risky overtaking manoeuvres to get around me nearly colliding with oncoming vehicles.

Over the course of the summer, I'll be advancing my knowledge of programming, but when I get to university, I can just borrow the books and learn from them that way.

Addressing the point about a laptop and computer:

I currently own a Chromebook. It has no windows drivers, so there is a problem there already. I'm thinking of using that when taking notes and doing light web work, and then like you suggested, buying a laptop which will allow me to take both Windows and Linux around with me. I can just partition the hard drive, since we'll be learning how to secure and work with both (I suppose it should be all, since there are many versions of each, but that doesn't work very well in the sentence so I'll leave this clarification here) operating systems.

I could invest a small amount into a laptop that would give me access to all of the programs and tools I need and then upgrade my desktop after university or during my sandwich year when I will be earning money.

What do you reckon to that idea? Good or bad?

Again, thank you for your time and the reply.

At the moment, you would rightly object if both you and the defender in an action were represented by the same legal firm. It's a very clear conflict of interest for the firm, and is thus banned. In a nationalised system, this would be true of every case. In rural areas, it would be likely that both parties would be represented by direct colleagues - people working together in the same office. 

As an example, imagine you live in Lerwick, and feel that you have been defamed by an article in The Shetland Times. You decide to sue the newspaper. They choose to defend the action. In all likelihood, both the pursuer's solicitor and defender's solicitor will work in the same office and know each other intimately. The legal profession in Shetland is not large, and there are even fewer people with experience in defamation. In this case, it's almost inevitable that something gets shared accidentally. An overheard phone-call or even just admin staff accidentally giving the wrong copy of the paperwork to one of the solicitors. 

Taking this further, imagine that your case fails, but you feel that you were represented negligently. You want to sue your solicitor for this negligent representation. You now have the nationalised legal firm suing itself. There's an obvious and enormous conflict of interest there. 

What happens if you want to sue the government? You now have a government employee trying to sue their employer. Given the atrocious treatment of NHS whistle-blowers, I would expect undue influence from the government to be exerted.

a) form a minority government with Labour which would not be seen as legitimate in the eyes of the public. Labour would be more likely to sign up to Lib Dem policies, but it would be almost impossible to implement them.

b) join the Tories and actually have some of their policies implemented at the cost of joining up with a party they don't necessarily agree with. 

c) Side with neither, let the Tories form a minority government. This would cause huge economic insecurity and severely harm the UK and it is likely a second election would follow soon with them likely to get less votes the the Tories likely to gain more.

I don't envy the choices they have to make. The decision between 1 or 2 is particularly difficult. But there are two more factors about the Lib Dem background:

1. Lib Dems are very pro-European and their model of democracy, for them coalitions are not a negative thing and of the three big parties they were the less combative and more willing to work with others even before getting into power.

2. Lib Dems aren't just a bunch of left-wingers. The Social Democrats formed out of Labour members who thought Labour was too left-wing in the 80s. They were then joined by the long dead Liberal party which has swung between the left and right wildly. Members like David Laws and Danny Alexander are extremely centrist and Cameron early on tried to move the Tories to the centre (though I'd say he has failed).",null,0,null,1427664220,null,0,false,0,cputv25,null,t3_30prpi,null,t1_cputv25,null,t1_cpusv38,null,null,null,1432084523,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

null,false,JustAhobbyish,null,null,null,"&gt; This argument would stand if the leader of the EU commission, Juncker, didn't believe in further integration and expansionism. He is a federalist, he only cares about making the EU more supra-national at the detriment of what other nations think. If you seriously believe that Britain is solely at fault, then you have bought into the Pro-EU propaganda with too much gusto.

And Juncker is correct for the Eurozone to carry on that is required. Eurozone needs to become federal.  European union that path is less clear I would like it to become more federal in nature that me, but the current system works bit like that already. 
In what shape should the EU change? And why do you believe that? 

&gt; You believe in an idealistic dream if you think Germany will ever allow Britain a chance to shape the EU. Seriously, they don't want to hear what we say, as what Britain wants to change is a fundamental to the EU project. This leaves no room for anything really, until one side backs down.

Germany is just one piece in the puzzle, other nations in the EU. You don't go into any negotiation without some lines you're willing to move for a price.   Britain list of changes is just designed to suit domestic politics. 

&gt; Is this the same Lib dems that promised an EU referendum in 2005? but now, since the wave of anti-EU feeling has grown, have changed their tack because they know they will lose.
The same Lib dems who couldn't argue efficiently when the head to head went on between Nigel Farage and Nick Clegg?
Give me a break.

Given how the EU has yet to recover and gone down austerity road little wonder people don't like the EU? 
1930s policy gives you 1930s again. 
At least the Lib dems decided to challenge his voice compared to the others who just gave in to populist noise. Willing to stand for what you believe in instead of hide and change your tune to gain votes. 

&gt; As are many elements of EU life, has it occured to you that the most powerful man in the EU is unelected, that the only people who formulate any policy are unelected officials. The MEPs aren't much better, since they are lobbied all the time by different pressure groups and no one bats an eye.

That needs to change at home and within the EU. So here a question what would you do to fix it? 
I don't know off the top of my head how I would fix that without it becoming a wasteful event.  Given how most people don't know how the EU works right now or eurozone most people can't make choice on the subject. 

&gt; And there you have it, your mission. A one size fits all policy doesn't work. You believe in an old and outdated view that the EU has. Something that clearly failed when the Eurozone crashed and showed that every Eurozone member, would break the rules they all agreed to.

Eurozone failed due it flawed design which was unfinished.  Nations had to break rules due to lacking the framework to support them.  Never set out my mission for the EU or what I would change.  Do explain to me why you believe in the view point the EU is bad and how you would fix it?

&gt; Your arrogance is astounding, it truly is. Your end goal is for Britain to become passive and just let the EU tell us what to do. Which is ignorant, arrogant and down right stupid. Getting rid of this ""little englander view"" as you call it is essentially saying ""STOP BEING PROUD OF YOUR HISTORY AND EMBRACE THE NEW WORLD ORDER"". Which I will not stand for.
My end goal is for Britain to stop being so passive and embrace being part of the European project becoming a active member in the shape and direction.

Don't get me wrong I think we could agree on some basic items like one size fits all policy does not work and reform is required just the details not so much.  Maybe for the common trade block details we could agree on but I doubt it for the eurozone.

One of my favourite teachers at school taught physics but would regularly talk to me about medieval history because that was one of his other passions and if money were no object his dream was to go back to uni and do a history postgrad. In one of my previous museums I worked with someone who was completing his PhD in a physics related subject but he too loved history, and he even studied it originally but went through a rough time with his mental health and ended up dropping out. When he reapplied for uni he decided to go down the science route but I never ever got the sense he valued one over the other. In fact he felt he would've probably coped better going through the mental breakdown during his science degrees.

My degrees are history and medieval studies. I work in a museum largely focused on historical and social collections. But I still have a passing interest in physics to the point where I love visiting science museums as much as I love visiting historical sites. My life is enriched every day by a combination of arts, humanities and science and it sounds like yours is too.

But like you I just want to do something I love that will make me enough money to be comfortable, and that basically is my life. So I guess people motivated purely by money would say ""you would say that"" to me, but sometimes I think life's too short to worry about how much money I'm making.

The judiciary and legal system, which includes the entirety of the legal profession needs to be kept as separate as possible from the government. The minute the Executive and/or the Legislature have this kind of control over the legal system is the moment all balance, democracy and the rule of law go out the window. 

As someone else points out there would also be conflict of interest issues when a.) you wanted to bring an action against the government itself, and b.) when you wanted to sue anyone else also using the ""NLS."" You could have rules to mitigate instances of frivolous lawsuits or vexatious litigants, but the above problems would be far more serious. 

What you propose isn't the same as legal aid (which of course needs to be well funded) since legal aid is strictly means tested and is effectively a safety net for those who really stand to lose by not being able to afford representation or advice, and not what effectively amounts to a humongous national law firm run by the government.

&gt;

&gt;__Marmite__ (/ˈmɑrmaɪt/ *__MAR__-myt*) is the [brand name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand_name) for two similar [food spreads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spread_(food\)): the original British version, since 2000 a [Unilever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilever) product; and a modified version produced in New Zealand by [Sanitarium Health Food Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitarium_Health_Food_Company) and distributed in Australia and the Pacific. Marmite is made from [yeast extract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeast_extract), a [by-product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/By-product) of [beer brewing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewing). Other similar products include the Australian [Vegemite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegemite), which is saltier in taste, the Swiss [Cenovis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cenovis) and the German Vitam-R.

&gt;The British version of the product is a sticky, dark brown [food paste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paste_(food\)) with a distinctive, powerful flavour, which is extremely salty. This distinctive taste is reflected in the British company's marketing slogan: ""Love it or hate it."" The product's name has entered British English as a metaphor for something that is an acquired taste or tends to polarise opinions. 

&gt;A version with a different flavour  has been manufactured in New Zealand since 1919. This is the only product sold as Marmite in Australia and the Pacific, whereas elsewhere in the world the British version predominates.

There are a set of 'expected' behaviours created by this ""zeitgeist"" that wouldn't really be too much of an issue at all if missed in an everyday context.

Fantastic example of this very recently - Natalie Bennett's ""brain fade"" in an interview some way back. If you think about it and pay attention to the rest of her behaviour most people think it's quite reasonable for her to be forgiven for it, crucially by the definition of the word 'competence' she isn't really significantly worse at politics than everyone else, but according to the ""zeitgeist"" it was an *unspeakable lapse*. In fact, it wasn't just this ""zeitgeist"", even *Reddit* itself exhibited a similar level of expectation, especially when you consider the general attitudes in the threads surrounding the event. 

Nick Clegg had exactly the same problem facing him in a video, about not knowing the information at hand about a similar question (can someone on Reddit find it for me please?) but being slightly more savvy at politics, did the usual... answered it without answering it.

Good example of a youth player that impressed in the first team at 17 that was subsequently mishandled and sent out on loans to clubs that had no desire to develop him as they have their own interests first (understandably). Definitely could be at Chelsea now had Ancelotti stayed as manager and continued to develop him. 


&gt;Kakuta


Hyped, but had a poor attitude from everything I've read. Didn't train hard enough and just thought he could coast by on talent, as he'd likely been able to at youth level.

&gt; Hillion said: ""Frankly, I don't know why he put an end to his stay with the Dutch club.

&gt; ""It is a huge waste. I already said it and I repeat it, he is the most gifted player of his generation.

&gt; ""He could have been exceptional.

&gt; ""But talent is not enough. When you pile on failures and there is trouble in any club where you played, you have to ask the right questions and question yourself.

&gt; ""There was Bolton, Fulham and Dijon too. You can't manage everything in a player's career.

&gt; ""You can't manage what is on his mind, his entourage or his family.""


&gt;Piazon and Romeu


Never really hyped, and Romeu looked decent for the first team until a horrific injury set him back, not unlike Van Ginkel (well, the injury part, Van Ginkel never got a chance to impress in the team as it came so early). 


My point wasn't that Macheda was a superstar, it was that in a clearly ridiculously high pressure scenario he came in and scored, he is credited as being a major figure in a title win. Ferguson took the chance on a youth player that many hadn't heard of and was rewarded, something that Mourinho will never do. My point is that experience isn't always the best thing. And hell, Ramires has both shown great ability under pressure, Barcelona, but also tons of moments where he just loses it and is reckless and costs Chelsea or nearly does. 


The fact is you'll never truly know how someone will react to first team football until you try them. Look at Kane this season, he had some unimpressive loans and people like you would have used them to say he wasn't good enough, but now he's well in contention for the golden boot despite only starting to play in November.

Why? because it does not fit your ideology? 

The  [Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Exploitation in Rotherham](http://www.rotherham.gov.uk/downloads/file/1407/independent_inquiry_cse_in_rotherham) mentions several times that fear of being accused of racism played a part in what happened:

&gt;Several councillors interviewed believed that by opening up these issues they could be 'giving oxygen' to racist perspectives that might in turn attract extremist political groups and threaten community cohesion.

&gt;He was one of the elected members who said they thought the criminal  convictions in 2010 were 'a one-off, isolated case', and not an example of a more deep-rooted problem of Pakistani-heritage perpetrators targeting young white girls. This was at best naïve, and at worst ignoring a politically  inconvenient truth.

&gt;By far the majority of perpetrators were described as 'Asian' by victims, yet throughout the entire period, councillors did not engage directly with the Pakistani-heritage community to discuss how best they could jointly address the issue. Some councillors seemed to think it was a one-off problem, which they hoped would go away. Several staff described their nervousness about identifying the ethnic origins of perpetrators for fear of being thought racist; others remembered clear direction from their managers not to do so.

&gt;there was a widespread perception that messages conveyed by some senior people in the Council and also the Police, were to 'downplay' the ethnic dimensions of CSE. Unsurprisingly, frontline staff appeared to be confused as to what they were supposed to say and do and what would be interpreted as 'racist'. 

&gt;Frontline staff did not report personal experience of attempts to influence their practice or decision making because of ethnic issues. Those who had involvement in CSE were acutely aware of these issues and recalled a general nervousness in the earlier years about discussing them, for fear of being thought racist.

Nobody is suggesting that the ONLY reason it happened was political correctness. But to suggest it played no part, to quote the report is ""at best naïve, and at worst ignoring an inconvenient truth.""

As far as im aware, northern ireland leaving the united ireland that it had been in for two days and then joinng the union was exercising the right of people to choose their own sovereignty. Northern ireland decided to join the UK. The UK did no forcibly keep us in the uk.

&gt;A __clapperboard__ is a device used in [filmmaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking) and [video production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_production) to assist in the synchronizing of picture and sound, and to designate and mark particular [scenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scene_(fiction\)) and [takes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take) recorded during a production. The sharp ""clap"" noise that the clapperboard makes can be identified easily on the audio track, and the shutting of the clapstick can be identified easily on the separate visual track. The two tracks can then be precisely synchronised by matching the sound and movement. Other names for the clapperboard include __clapper__, __clapboard__, __slate__, __slate board__, __sync slate__, __time slate__, __sticks__, __board__, and __sound marker__.

I took the maintenance loans for the years I was at university and I bought cool stuff with mine. Considering that this is /R/UKPersonalFinance, It might not have been the best thing for me to do at the time, but it made my life so much richer.

I bought a desktop computer (for doing work, gaming, etc), a kayak (I joined the watersports club and went kayaking with the club fairly regularly), a PS3, new DSLR camera. I also worked part-time at a hospital and took home £120 a week.

I'm on £28k at the moment, and I pay £80.00 a month in student loan contributions. Do I look back and think it was worth it? **Hell yes**. I'd be paying that £80.00 for my tuition fees anyway, and I got a load of stuff which helped me do things for fun.

With hindsight, I probably should have taken the maintenance loans, put them in high-interest savers. My debt is written off after 25 years, and at this current rate I'm not going to pay it all off in the timeframe anyway, so I've just got some extra stuff paid for in part by the taxpayer.

It's highly highly unlikely (read: impossible) that they would remember the detail of your application from last year. Don't worry about it. I would say that you learnt the stuff in your own time. Doesn't matter if you didn't sit the exam. Just be aware they may ask you about the material (unlikely in engineering interview tbh).

&gt;Do I have to mention the fact that I did STEP and if so, would I be gambling something good away by doing STEP?

Genuinely think he'd be pushing Clichy and probably take 1st choice off him eventually. 

On top of all that he's gonna be so much cheaper than Kurzawa/Willems - I reckon it'd be between 10-15m to get West Ham to let him go, and I'd assume he'd be very happy to come, which helps enormously. And that would mean more money to spend elsewhere and as he's HG we wouldn't have to pay over the odds on a HG midfielder to replace Milner if he leaves. 


And because of all those reasons, I don't expect to see him here next year. Under Txiki we're much more likely to overspend on a Portuguese player or buy a 31 year old.

A 240V &gt; 110V transformer doesn't do any magical ""voltage helping"", it provides 110V. Like it'd get from the wall in a country that uses 110V. Simple as that.

There's one small thing: unless you buy an inverting power supply, it'll provide 50Hz rather than 60Hz, but the amount of devices that actually require a specific frequency to such a small tolerance is so small I can count it on one hand.


TL;DR for OP: Most ""electronic"" electronics (laptops, phones, anything with an external charger that isn't a straight up transformer basically) should be absolutely fine, just double check the range on the label includes 240V 50Hz and you're golden.

Depends on your contract - generally 9-5 unless you've got something going live.

Very much depends on the employer in my experience.

&gt; How much vacation do people typically get?

I do contract work, so am not best placed to answer that.

&gt; What are typical salaries for a intermediate full stack web programmer?

&gt;What are the major types of employment? (start ups, large corporation, etc.)

There are a lot of little web dev houses, but there are also a lot of large organisations - banks / government / blue chip etc, that have various development projects on the go.

&gt; What are especially good job boards?

There are several - what would probably be better is to talk to a couple of recruitment agencies about your skillset and what you're looking for.

&gt; How hard is it to find a job (or be picky and choosy)?

There's more web &amp; dev stuff out there than systems stuff at the moment - I wouldn't say the market it awesome, but it's certainly not terrible either.
