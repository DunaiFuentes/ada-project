You are conflating a typical response to something like the story that people never went to the moon and it was all a fake done by Stanly Kubric with an interpretation about how society works or whatever the fuck it was four days ago that isn't even controversial among thirty percent of the population.

No, not really. It is interesting to see you get so worked up over an economy's measure of production though.

Chances are most of the time it'll either be a goal/corner/goal-kick fairly quickly, which gives a natural stopping point to check a video review, or the defence pick up the ball and you can call just play advantage given they've got possession anyway. Offsides are actually one of the better calls to give to a video referee because they're usually in circumstances where it's unlikely that there'll be long string of play where the potentially infringing side keep the ball and you have to call the decision back several minutes after the fact. They're also, unlike dives with marginal contact or soft penalties, pretty objective once you've got video footage as to what the correct decision is. 

If the linesman is completely certain one way or another he can make a call, if not he can let play go on and leave it to a video review. Best of both worlds.

If you don't know what you're doing, don't use a second router as a router. You just need an Access Point. Some routers can be set up to work as an access point, but if you plug the WAN port of the second router in a LAN port of the first router... It'll appear to work fine, and you'll be able to browse the net and stuff, but anything relying on NAT will likely be buggered. This may impact on your matchmaking. It's because you'll be NAT'd twice, once at the first router and again at the second.

There are ways of setting it up with most routers, like disabling all the DHCP and NAT stuff on the second router and plugging the ethernet between a LAN port of the first router and of the second.

But just get a Wifi extender. You can pick them up for about £15. B&amp;M sell ones for £14.99, you can get them in PCW, Argos, Tescos, Asda etc.

My opinion is that the job we need our strikers to do isn't one he's capable of. Look at our best strikers - Bony, Gomis recently, Danny Graham before and Jason Scotland before that. The common theme is that they can take the ball under heavy pressure and not get brushed off straight away. Bony was the master of this - he'd get the ball and he was so good at holding off defenders that you'd often see him walking the ball forward while holding off a player behind him.

Nelson can't do it. His first touch is far too loose and he doesn't seem able to trap a ball under pressure. Every time he received the ball he seemed to knock the ball a metre or more away from himself, allowing defenders the space to cut inside him and take it away.

Furthermore, as I mentioned in the main post, his positioning doesn't fit the role. Instead of finding himself a bit of space just in front of one of the centrebacks, he kept running too far to the sides of the pitch when we would like to be passing to him. I would imagine this is because of the previous point, and he knows that if he sits in front of the centrebacks he will immediately get tackled. Unfortunately, this means passing to him at all is a waste of time as he can't do anything from his position and there's now nobody forward for him to pass onto.

I don't know if he's bad or not, but I know he doesn't fit our style of play. I can imagine he'd be much better if he played with someone like Andy Carroll, who could do the heavy work for him and knock the ball down to him where he is facing goal and can immediately charge forward. Our strikers have to start their possession by having their backs to goal, which for Nelson means he's going to get tackled.",null,0,null,1429482448,null,0,false,0,cqhvmk8,null,t3_335c5o,null,t1_cqhvmk8,null,t1_cqhvbjl,null,null,null,1432486208,null,1,false,swanseacity,t5_2tip4,1,null

I know for a fact that these pills cost the NHS 3.81 a month, but that's a whole other debate) and all was well. I paid my $20 visit copay, like it says I have to in my insurance terms and went on my merry way.

Last week I received a bill for $175. For a 10 minute chat with a doctor who is definitely in my network? Which I already paid the copay for?! Really?! REALLY?!

* Charles wants to vote for Party C. He knows they won't win so doesn't care. He may even vote for another party.

If it wasn't for the results from last time, each would have an equal chance of winning. But *past results distort the true nature of the voters*.

IMO that is likely a major culprit, especially when you need to reapply. The areas of the face that are the thinnest/ most sensitive are the eyes and around the mouth, which is exactly where you are describing issues.

Moisturiser should be preventative not reactive. By the time you feel a problem you have already got dehydration and the skin is exfoliating itself less effectively. A light serum is certainly not an adequate barrier between a product loaded with drying alcohol and your skin - it is desperately trying to put back the structural lipids that alcohol removes.

Certainly review your diet as others have noted if you have not already.

You're right that it is a difficult situation but any answer to your question would be meaningless. Context matters too much. It would be hard for me to go over any other event because that assumes I know how it unfolded, and what was known and when. But what I do know is that our foreign policy is not up for debate this election, no mention we nearly rushed into a completely new war, our soldiers are still Heros no matter what, no mention of torture, no mention of PDS, no mention of our spying on foreign and domestic persons - not even targets just anyone in the net. Just not up for discussion.

Seems I've built up to a rant I'll continue. I am fairly happy with the UK, as an economist I have complaints about our macroeconomic policy at the moment, as a human being im not keen on unequal impact that our collapse and recovery that is happening, but as far as it goes, on this island im only moderately disgruntled. But our foreign policy is something else. The words 'national security' are uttered and veil of secracy collapses over any issue, we hear scant rumours of torture and abuse of POW, if they are even regarded that highly these days, which our government brushes off. Then photos are leaked, and it's brushed off or covered up. And thats if you follow the new stuff.

* Assists is not a particularly useful stat for a lot of reasons.  Paulinho's numbers are as meaningful as Lamela's numbers.  Lamela is our assists leader by some distance.  Is Lamela our best attacking mid?  Not by a country mile and then some.

* Goals aren't even remotely a good way to judge a CM, unless it's such a big part of their game that it dominates all the more essential aspects of CM play.  And 2 goals is no great shakes, much as his being our 5th leading scorer last season (3rd in our league matches) on a team that struggled to score goals doesn't mean all that much.

* Definitely.  Some of us have said this since the very first game in which he took a corner.  I haven't seen anyone argue against this, but it is often overlooked in discussions about him.

* This isn't really true.  We've kept 13 clean sheets in all competitions.  In only 4 of these matches has Paulinho played more than 33 minutes.  Paulinho is not the reason we keep clean sheets.  In most matches that he's played as a CM, he's been much weaker than he should be as a CM.  He occasionally presses aggressively, by usually his workrate is actually quite poor.  And interceptions?  He makes the fewest interceptions per 90min of all of our CM: 0.7 overall, and just 0.4 in Premier League matches.  He's better in the Europa League, but still behind Bentaleb and Stambouli.  ""Key interceptions"" is not a stat I have access to, and is largely subjective, so I'll just leave it at ""I don't agree.""

* His passing range from CM has been mediocre.  Probably the worst of all our CMs except Dembele.  In and around the box, it has been significantly better, but still not good enough to make up for all the other things he hasn't done well, and not good enough to make him a better CAM than our other options there.

He has not been good for us overall in the past two seasons.  He was good today.  He has been good a handful of other times.  He has been better during the second half of this season than the first half, so at least he is showing improvement.  Hopefully he can build on today's performance and his performance against Leicester.

You're comparing 2 games that are 7 months apart. He was dropped for 3 of those. How exactly do you want him to score if he wasn't being pick because of BR stubbornness?  A goal is a goal no matter if wasn't that great of a goal. The Lallana goal does count as an assist what the fuck are you on about. He kicked it, hard enough for it to rebound,  and Lallana got it. 

&gt;Besiktas was a penalty. They are the easiest chances in football. 

Would you rather have Sturridge take the penalty (who absolutely skied the last 2 he took), or Henderson who was already tired and could've probably missed it or Balo who was confident he could score it because he's scored plenty of them before? We were 0-0 and we got a late penalty and being 1-0 up gave us an advantage in the second leg. And since I'm mentioning the second leg why don't I also mention that Balo created multiple chances for Sterling and Sturridge but they both wasted those chances. I don't know if you remember the 1v1 between Sturridge and their GK which Balo set up with a pass to Sturridge that he missed. Also Neither Sturridge or Sterling did anything that game and Balo was the one dropping back to get the ball to bring it back up. Why didn't Sterling or Sturridge do anything in those 4 games?

null,false,Rosti_LFC,lfc93,,null,"People keep saying the transfer policy has failed, but that's working on the assumption that our transfer policy was structured around us being immediately successful this season, which is bollocks. 

The transfer policy is pretty clearly targeting youthful players with potential at a reasonable price. It's a strategy which, short of a miracle, is never going to win us a league in the short term because you don't win the league against teams like Chelsea and (last season's) City when your average starting age is under 24. 

I don't believe for one second that Brendan Rodgers or anyone else on the transfer committee genuinely thought that replacing Suarez with £100m of promising kids was going to get us a title this season. Maybe they underestimated Man Utd's revival and thought we'd still finish above them and get a top four place, but I'm pretty sure they were prepared for this season and the next to be a bit rocky. The trade-off being a pretty solid squad in a couple of years for what would retrospectively be fairly low spending. 

We can field a first XI at the moment where our most senior players are the likes of Lucas Leiva and Adam Lallana at the ripe old ages of 28 and 26 respectively. Take out Skrtel, Johnson, Gerrard, Lucas and Lallana, and the rest of the current first team squad is 25 or under. We could spend *absolutely fuck-all* in the next 5 seasons and if we can retain people we'll still most likely be doing as well or better than we have done this season (i.e. in contention for top 4) as players develop and mature. *That* is what our transfer policy recently has given us. 

If people want to complain our transfer policy is a pile of wank, then they've got wait at least two or three years before they can really suggest it, because that's when our transfer policy's target return on investment is meant to kick in. This stuff is long-term. 
It's like the stadium expansion - it's not going to pay itself off in one year, and people bitching about how it hasn't are just completely missing the point.

Milner can play almost anywhere, and he has much more quality than say Allen. He'd be an upgrade and gives us options from the bench.

Schar is a great defender, available as he has only a year on his contract. His style would suit us perfectly. 

Vietto could lead our line, Aguero like in style and has a fairly low buyout clause. 

Krychowiak would give us a Matic like presence and allow Hendo to get forward. Lucas is too injury prone. Again, this isn't the way Rodgers prefers but he'd fit in this league perfectly. Also if we signed Schar (can play rb), Can could play in his favoured midfield role.

If we still have money, perhaps go for a big signing like Firmino.

Edit: Perhaps just as importantly, who to get rid of.

Balotelli, Borini, Johnson, Allen, and Kolo. That should bring in around £20-25m if we're lucky.

After that we have to try buy new first team talent - which we will struggle to attract and realistically can't afford. This is of course assuming that all purchased talent clicks immediately and we know this very well may not be the case (see Baldini 7).

Another overhaul would also unsettle the squad, there is something to be said for a settled squad that has played together for a while. Chopping and changing, wheeling and dealing, every damn season hurts us in ways that theory crafting doesn't catch.

But he's set fire to that idea by literally being on fire right now and banging in goals left and right. 

I actually don't think that we are going to waste a bench spot by having a 3rd choice striker. I think our bench is going to look something like this:

GK - Rob Green

LB - Filipe Luis/Aaron Cresswell or another attacking LB (if Luis decides to leave)

CB - Kurt Zouma

DM - Mikel

CM - Ramires or RLC/van Ginkel (if Ramires is sold) 

AM/RM - Willian (I think Cuadrado will win starting job next year plus Willian will be better off the bench when he can run like crazy and everybody's tired)

Winger/AM - I think we're going to sign another winger/AM this summer, we've been heavily linked with Douglas Costa, and recently Felipe Anderson, and I think Jose's probably thinking that he'd rather have another winger/AM instead of a 3rd striker, helps that Cuadrado can also play up top in a 2 striker setup. 

ST - Loic Remy 

I realize that that's 8 guys, but not all of these guys are always going to be fit at the same time. Anyways, I think the duty of 3rd choice striker will probably be left to Bamford if Middlesborough are not promoted to the PL. I think if they are and they want him on loan again, we will sign some middling striker who is big and can hold up the ball like Drogba would, but won't really be called upon much, and will rot on the bench mostly, like Emenike or something.

There are two ways to look at dual strikers. One is that one of them is a tap-in guy, while the other one does all the running. The other way is that one is a physical target man while the other guy does all the running.

Either way, the striker that does all the running can do all the running without being a striker. Rarely, if ever, do you see two strikers who have the same job (I don't think it's even possible, save for continuously swapping roles, because without one to support the other, you wouldn't even get past the defense).

Anyone who's looked for work in the last couple of years KNOWS that 35 hours of jobsearch a week is a complete and demoralising waste of time, and almost everything can be done in an hour, give an extra hour if there's stuff worth applying for.

To force people to give up training, education, volunteering and the like because it's cutting into the 35 hours min jobsearch conditions is just hateful ideology, as all the above are more likely to help you find work that the last 25 hours of jobsearch in a week.

I have a friend who found that she could do a course, that would help get her the qualifications needed to move into her chosen line of work, but it was a couple of hundred pounds, they of course wouldn't pay.  Her family found out, and they put up the money, and she checked with the job centre.  They said fine, and she booked the course.

They then moved her signing on day and time to the day and time of the course, and flatly refused to move it, despite knowing her course and knowing she couldn't move it or cancel.

So, in order to not be left with nothing to live on, she had to throw away her family's money and the opportunity to get a gainful qualification.  Of course, althought it's clearly not her fault, she now feels like she's failed and will likely not be willing to try again.

The powder highlights can be used with a light hand to look more subtle, which is something to remember if they look a little too glitzy in the pan.

Aspas, Alberto, Ilori.  £21M spent and no plan for what to do with any of them.

We paid £4M to loan in Sahin.  How'd that work out?  Or the other £2M+ spent on Cisshoko and Moses.

Lovren and Balotelli I'd really argue are. Balotelli is 24, Lovren 25. Yeah, they're hardly youth players, but at the same time I think it's fair to argue that they're still before their peak, and you wouldn't expect either of them to be seeing serious decline in their performances in the next 3-5 years. Which fits the synergy of the rest of our current squad and spending strategy towards having most of our players in their prime years around 2-3 years from now.

&gt; I'm pretty sure the owners weren't expecting to spend £120M+ and fall at least three spots

Net spend was under £40m. Quoting £120m doesn't represent the actual change in value of the squad, and is a completely irrelevant figure in terms of investment in the side and how you'd expect performances to change. If we'd not sold Suarez, we probably wouldn't have spent £120m, and we also probably wouldn't be 5th. 

&gt;get bombed out of the CL by the Swiss champions and the best team in Bulgaria

Another case of you subtly twisting how you represent things to fit your own agenda. We finished above Ludogorets in the group - we actually went out to Real Madrid, which I think is fair enough, and FC Basel, who all things considered aren't a bad side in Europe (they got beat 5-1 on aggregate by Porto, but then Bayern Munich are currently 3-1 down against them from the first leg too) and [have even knocked us out before](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002%E2%80%9303_UEFA_Champions_League#Group_B). 

&gt; nor now getting pretty well thrashed by Aston Villa in the semifinal of the FA Cup.

Yes because only getting to the semi-final of the FA Cup (and League Cup) is clearly an absolutely dismal result for the club, and a single performance defines an entire season. Just like that shitty squad we had that lost to [a typically rubbish Crystal Palace in the 1990 Semi-Final](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989%E2%80%9390_FA_Cup#Semi-finals) (as the media apparently won't forget about ever) in a season where they also won a league title...

Did you really go into this season after the summer spending thinking that we were going to waltz ahead of the likes of Arsenal and Man City? Or that we'd win a bunch of trophies? Or get into the last 8 or better of the Champions League?

If you did, on what possible basis?

And if you didn't, what exactly makes you think that you're so much smarter and on the ball when it comes to football than the people spending literally hundreds of millions on a football club, and the advisers who they pay what are presumably fairly handsome salaries to know their shit about football? How come you knew we'd have a dodgy season and yet feel free to argue that the owners totally didn't see it coming?

Maybe they thought we'd still finish above United and therefore scrape a top four spot. Maybe they figured we'd at least get out of the group stages. But given how long they've been running sports clubs and the way sports is in terms of margins and upsets, I'd be amazed if they weren't at least anticipating the possibility of the scenario we're in right now.

I must have missed a post somewhere saying that, since you're quoting the phrase. It didn't come from me anyway, so this notion of oppressive brits is irrelevant to what I'm talking about.

We spend more per head on health than anywhere else in the UK with worse outcomes. We had a 40 year long conflict with ~3000 deaths and many many more injured, physically or psychologically. We then have many, many, many more people indirectly affected via neighbours, friends, relatives, etc. When was the last time that happened in Britain? I'd say the English Civil War but you can correct me on that. 

You can't compare our abnormal history and conflict with other parts of the UK, where life is as normal as anywhere else in Europe. Our outcomes are naturally going to be worse due to the complexity of health issues people here have related to that conflict and after. Unionists on this subreddit are usually briming with pride that our health professionals are world leaders in conflict related health problems, but not this time it seems. 

We spend more per head on education than the rest of the UK. I don't know much education standards beyond my own experiences, so I'd like to see your sources for that claim. I'll not argue the point. 

re: west Belfast, as you say in another post, its statistically the worst place in NI for welfare dependency. It was also seen some of the worst of the troubles if not the worst on a day to day basis. What I don't get is this tokenism about protestants living in the west to get around the bigotry accusations (not that im accusing you of that, other people are though). You're talking about the shankill. You also know fine rightly that the Shankill is a blip on the map compared to the rest of west Belfast which is a huge constituency with &gt;60,000 people. You haven't made any point at all there, you've just cherrypicked a quick example from the belfast telegraph to back up whatever the fuck it is you're trying to back up. 

&gt; Less on inefficiently teaching children according to the religion of their parents and making them feel different from the other lot. More on supporting skilled apprenticeships.

Agree.

&gt; Less on frivolities like Irish language schools for less than 20 kids and needless Ulster Scots Agencies. More on global language teaching and reducing the tax burden on small start up businesses.

Keeping alive a valuable part of our collective national identity is not frivolous and to base our values purely on financial cost is foolish and honestly, pretty grim. Don't get me wrong, its important to be able to afford these things, but as you say, ""we just need to wise up on what we spend it on."", in which case there are a lot of spending reforms that can be made on the promotion of the Irish language and Ulster Scots cultue, it *doesnt* mean wiping it out. Personally, I went through Irish medium education from nursary until I was 16. The methods used to teach me were successful and we see squabbling in England about better practices that resemble how I was taught. Irish medium education is way ahead of the game in that regard.What I *do agree with* is global language teaching. Kids should be learning important foreign languages that in 15 years time will let us open up to the world. Dutch, German, French, Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, the list is endless.  
&gt; I don't see why London taxpayers should always have to foot the bill for that patheticness - its only subsidising the failure of Sinn Fein-DUP, so that they can carry on being irresponsible. 

Firstly, the vast majority of tax payers don't live in London, so I don't know where the fuck you pulled London from. But either way, London created Northern Ireland. You know our history as well as I do, the state was created for other reasons open to interpretation depending on your ideology. Pretty much all of these ideologies agree that it wasn't created to be an economic success, it was simply assumed this would be the case because it remained part of the UK. The argument that being part of the UK is financially beneficial hasn't stood up to the test of time. Its a fallacy. This generation (or the previous two for that matter) was not involved in that decision but we live with the legacies of previous generations. Little was done to promote economic success during the 50 years unionist dictatorship, or during the 30~ years of direct dictatorship from London. Economic success was fucked through the bigotry of its own establishment - who alienates masses of its working population because they're a different religion? There was no thought of having a booming economy there, the unionist dictatorship until the 70s couldn't bring itself to properly mobilise its working population to its full potential, it was more concerned about who was a catholic. 

Ultimately, I would say that Britain spends more on war than it does on an apparently integral part of the UK in desperate need of external (as in beyond NI) investment. So aye, its all about prioritisation, isn't it? The money is there. If the British government have a hard time coming up with a few extra billion for essential services, then it clearly isn't the economic powerhouse unionists claim it to be. Equally, if Britain *doesnt* want to give extra money to a part of the UK that was decimated by internal conflict, then our interests don't lie with Britain nor do the ideological interests of the current (and potentially future) Westminster government help us in the slightest. 

What one is it? I'm not buying this ""we're skint"" argument. Britain has wealth most countries could only dream of. Its also incredibly patronising to people here. I pay my taxes and contribute to the local economy, so do most people. Ideoligicaly driven mantras against the poor, whether that is individual or state, as we've seen for the previous 5 years simply doesn't work.

null,false,jdhan2006,lfc68,,null,"You have to be kidding me that you see no difference from the way that team played when he took over and now?  

Strikers have been the biggest problem in regards to his signing history.  I will concede that.  Yes, Sterling, who looked like he could maybe play striker this season, is playing up front.  But you are not taking anything else into account.  You're not taking into account any other factors, as if every decision is made in a vacuum which is not the case.  
Balotelli I concede was a mistake.  Aspas didn't work.  Lambert was brought in as a sentimental move (prior to Suarez leaving) and depth, Borini was BR's first signing.  Sturridge is a success and Origi hasn't played a minute.  Who is the 7th striker?  Surely not Yesil.  

Since 2011-2012 Chelsea have spent 65 mil, Arsenal 56.5, City 108 on strikers alone.  All those teams have struggled with strikers at one point or another in the last few years.  LFC also went after Costa and Sanchez who turned them down.  You can only sign who is willing to come.  

Yes, and Sahko has been awesome this year.  Toure, signed on a free, has been a good sub when called upon.  Can played CB, RB at Leverkeusen so stop making it seem like he has no experience playing there.  Also has he not been good?  Again, I've conceded Lovren has not been good enough. 

Sending Ibe on loan is standard practice young player getting game time.  Ibe had the advantage of playing in England his whole life.  Markovic is entirely new to the system.  Every scout came out and said the kid has ridiculous potential which is the basis of the transfer ideology.  

Ok, but show me the team where every purchase became a first team star.  Please show me.  Every team has players brought in that do not work.  This is what I mean.  You expect a transfer committee to get every decision right every time which is totally unrealistic and ridiculous.  You and nickel and diming them.  They paid 8 mil on loans and you are damning them?!?!  You have got to be kidding me.  

What about Sturridge, Coutinho, Can Sahko?  What about the visible potential (again the basis for the transfers, for the team to develop) Moreno, Origi and Markovic? 

How could BR and the TC have done anything about the injuries to Lallana?  I don't know how you can look at that, consider the reality of when the moves were made, compare it to all the other teams in the BPL and still think every move is awful.  

Edit forgot to add this:

Also what about BR's work with Henderson and Sterling to get them to their current levels?

My major issue with the orange order is exactly what you describe. An organisation with a highly political active membership isn't dangerous in itself. When that group expouses (and is founded upon) hatred of others, and then has government ministers as members to protect it and achieve its private ambitions, it becomes dangerous in my view as those ministers are no longer looking out for the general population but a small number of people.

&gt;Clegg did not press the issue of his presence at last week’s debate partly because of an assurance that only the Lib Dem leader, and Cameron and Ed Miliband would appear in a final set of successive interviews each lasting half an hour as part of a single 90-minute programme.

&gt;But since then the BBC has offered Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, a further 30-minute slot in England, as well as 30-minute interviews for Leanne Wood, the Plaid Cymru leader in Wales, and for the Scottish Nationalist leader, Nicola Sturgeon, in Scotland

They have been mucked around here. I do however find it amusing that the end result of UKIP and the Lib Dems calling Cameron a chicken has ended up with them receiving a worse position than was originally mooted for the debates.

1.  The defeatist post game interview:  When he says Villa is a better team, it says he doesn't believe in his squad.

2.  Holding on to players that want to go:  Wenger never did it and neither should Rodgers.  It ultimately hurts recruitment.  If Rodgers stays the course and plays with the guys that want to play for him, he will be successful at LFC (and let's face it, is HAS been successful at LFC).

3.  The tough talking routine may fire up the fans, but it puts too much pressure on the team:  it may be who he is, but at what point do we look back at #1 and the players starting to lose faith in him?

He has good skill on the ball, can put in a really good defensive performance, and can move the ball forward - he's proven to be great at it. When he plays DM, I liken him to Alonso a bit. He's got a good bit of maturity already, can put in the cynical tackle if necessary and I think, could very well dictate the game. I would like to see him feature for us regularly next year.

You mention Newcastle but don't mention that Lovren got away with an absolute stonewall penalty. I mean there was no need for that tackle, it was bad defending plain and simple and I don't know how we escaped that one with the ref in perfect view.

we've spent more money.

the top 4 or so in germany is not as near set in stone as it is in england, making it easier to keep getting into CL. even if its not as consistent, a lot of decent teams at least have a chance, which they dont in england

completely lost his shit for half the season leading to them being stranded in relegation

still dont look anywhere near a great team, even though the results are coming in and might propel to europa league places (still a ways to go)

its too clsoe to call and I dont like giving the axe prematurely.  Hell I wanted Dalglish to have another season (then again, 2 cup finals, and andy carroll fuckin scored that one!), so you can damn well bet Id give Rodgers at least that.

Neither are good or bad in and of themselves, just different, and it's not like every game we see intricate passing play under BR either (see just this game as an example, where we were diabolical).

What other factors are there to take into account?  Fact- BR has bought 7 strikers.  Fact- our 2nd choice striker this season while Sturridge is out is not one of the remaining 6.  That is simply poor.  And why does Yesil not count?  Was he not a £1M transfer?  Was he not bought by Brendan?  A kid he may be, but he's older than Raheem.

No one expects every purchase to become a star player, that's a ludicrous suggestion and not at all what I've said.  I've said we bought badly and we have.  I've said we overpaid and we have.  I've said we bought players we didn't need with no plan on how they fit into the first team and we have.

What about Sturridge, Coutinho, Can, and Sakho?  They've all done well enough, but do you honestly think we could sell any (bar Coutinho) for more than we paid?  That's not the only measure of success, granted, but I would say no we couldn't.  Visible potential of Markovic?  I haven't seen it, to be honest, although partly not the kid's fault since apparently BR doesn't feel like playing him in a role that makes sense given his abilities.  Origi no one has a clue on as to how he will do.  I suspect he'll not impress next season, but I hope to be wrong on that.  Moreno looks very much a failed winger- he's been poor defensively and not too good going forward either.  I expected much better from him based on all of the hype on here about him.

Show me where Brendan has been willing to work with youth?  Rossiter got one game, scored, played well, and we haven't seen him again.  Same with Brad Smith, Teixeira, and a handful of others- they play once or make the bench and aren't seen again.  BR does, however, seem to like to buy youth which pushes the ones we have further down the pecking order which I see as a massive mistake.

The point isn't that I expect everyone we sign to be amazing and future legends of Anfield, but I do expect players we sign to a) not block the path of promising youngsters we already have, b) have a plan for why we are buying that player and how they fit into the side, c) be bought for reasonable prices and d) be an improvement on players we already have in the same positions otherwise what is the point?",null,0,null,1429508198,null,0,1429508401,0,cqi8n5u,null,t3_3366x6,null,t1_cqi8n5u,null,t1_cqi15su,null,null,null,1432492484,null,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3,null

**Style and skill-set wise, Lovren is a better fit for Rodgers than Skrtel is.** Skrtel is not a proactive defender - he's not big on interceptions, more on last-ditch tackles. His best defensive performances in a red shirt came when Steve Clarke set up our defence to sit deep and narrow and defend just in front of our box, and then in the 3-4-3 where he could be sweeper and let Sakho and Can do the proactive stuff. 

Rodgers would obviously prefer a back four, and in that he wants both CB's to be proactive - if his CB's are the type to drop off, while the rest of his team is pressing, then that creates a lot of space to be exploited by midfield runners. Lovren fits this perfectly, but...

**We got it wrong on personality**. Before/when Lovren came in, there was a lot of talk about Liverpool needing a 'defensive leader' at the back, and part of the reason we bought Lovren was because he was seen as this 'defensive leader' - Carra &amp; Neville praised him for it on MOTD, and he was the only change in the back four from Southampton's first season to their much-improved second.

At least Rodgers has the guts to play without a recognized Striker and still manage to pick up 3 points more often than not.

What problems would sacking BR cause? Let's start with Gerrard and Johnson leaving. Two of the most influential players in the team, so let's say Rodgers leaves too, that leaves a squad of players (most of whom have had their entire playing style and career built and nurtured by Rodgers) without a true leader who they've grown to know and understand during his tenure.

If Rodgers leaves Sterling will leave. You can bank on that. People argued that Rodgers playing hardball and making Suarez stay two years ago would have been a bad call, and how wrong they were. Rodgers dealing with Sterling directly and firmly is the best way to go with this, but do you really think Ian Ayre is going to sit Raheem down and convince him to stick around? Pfft.

Our academy products won't get the experience and exposure that they've had with Rodgers at the helm. Sinclair, Ibe, Sterling, Flanagan, Wisdom, Rossiter, Williams and Branagan (on the bench) are all academy products that Rodgers has shown faith in and managed to make the first squad. I don't think many other managers would show that kind of faith.

Here's the kicker. If we get rid of him, he'll end up Arsenal when Wenger leaves, United when Van Gaal leaves or City whenever their next guy leaves depending on who leaves first. Every coach in the league rates him incredibly highly, FSG rate him incredibly highly and *most* of the Liverpool fans rate him highly. He's going to end up at the top of English football whether it's at Liverpool or not. 

Sacking Hodgson didn't cause problems because we were ELEVENTH in the league. We're not remotely in the same position.

Kenny had assembled a squad of average Brits. We finished seventh and had a starting 11 which included Charlie Adam, Andy Carroll, Stewart Downing and Craig Bellamy. Again, it's not even comparable to where we are now. Sure we won the carling cup, whoop-de-fucking do. We got shafted in the league campaign and Kenny had to go.

He got Lovren - theoretically fit the bill, but seriously wrong when it comes to mentality.

Rodgers wants midfielders with the engine and work-rate to press, who are comfortable manipulating the ball in tight spaces, who provide through balls, and at least one real goal threat.

Its still hard to understand the fan separation as even at huge rivalry games in the states with fan bases that hate each other but still sit next to each other and a lot of the times that doesnt end well. 

So im excited to hopefully be able to come over for at least a week and get to see home and away matches. going to try to plan it to be able to see an early FA cup match too where hopefully well play the likes of Dover. I also plan to see a Bridport FC match where part of my moms family is from but back in the 1800s they left. So no real connection to a ""local"" club for my family.

Firstly there's the fact that the Tories won more seats in 2010 on a hard austerity ticket, and have not suffered a collapse in support after 5 years of devastatingly unfair cuts. There's also myriad information on public opinion this time around. For example:  
https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/04/16/marking-manifestos/  

76% approve of Labour's policy to reduce the deficit every year and ""balance the books"" as soon as possible, with only 11% saying it's the wrong priority.

Another data point, in last week's debate here are the public's reactions to the leaders' economic arguments:

You don't think Markovic hasn't shown any potential?  I thought any January game he was one of the really bright spots in the post-United period.  Origi I, also can't say anything about as I'm not sure how he will play.  Moreno has looked good.  Most of his mistakes were from a positional standpoint something that he can learn from.  Going forward I think he has looked pretty good, just finds himself pushed out wide and forced to cross into a box without anyone that is really good at heading the ball.  Once again, with time I feel like he can improve coming from another country. 

Liverpool have one of the youngest teams in the England.  Rossiter probably would have played more had he not been injured when Lucas and Gerrard were hurt, Ibe, Sterling, Flanagan, probably would have seen Yesil had he not hurt his knee again.

2nd paragraph - what an AMA is, and why its worth someone doing one (highlight Bill Gates etc)

3rd paragraph - what they need to do for an AMA on the NI subreddit to be facilitated.

(i.e. the scatter gun approach - but in this case could be the most efficient)

Don't want to give all the work to you (unless you're up for that?) - so maybe subreddit contributors could write the organisations/individuals they'd like to see, and the generic email address you could send to for the invitation?

null,false,chrisjd,,Green,null,"&gt; This is based on the rather flawed premise that the majority of the electorate don't want austerity. Firstly there's the fact that the Tories won more seats in 2010 on a hard austerity ticket, and have not suffered a collapse in support after 5 years of devastatingly unfair cuts. There's also myriad information on public opinion this time around. For example:
https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/04/16/marking-manifestos/[1]
76% approve of Labour's policy to reduce the deficit every year and ""balance the books"" as soon as possible, with only 11% saying it's the wrong priority.
Another data point, in last week's debate here are the public's reactions to the leaders' economic arguments:
http://labourlist.org/2015/04/snap-poll-says-miliband-won-the-challengers-tv-debate/[2]

People support austerity because they've been convinced by the Tories that eliminated the deficit in some arbitrary short time scale is a priority, Labours job in opposition should have been to oppose this idea, not just for the sake of opposing but because it is wrong - many economists agree that austerity hasn't and doesn't work.

Also, people saying they want austerity might not actually want to deal with the effects of it. One of the reasons the Tories have lost support is because they implemented austerity as promised for the first few years, but people were promised painless austerity from ""efficiency savings"" but what they actually got was a stalled economy and a million reliant on food backs. Labour have opposed the Tory austerity but then they too plan to implement more austerity if they win the election, they face the same risk as the Tories of promising more than they can deliver, people voting Labour because they are sick of Tory austerity are going to realise Labour only offer further spending cuts, and them things are going to get worse for the public sector and welfare recipients not better (they'd be worst still under the Tories, that's why the author is right to talk about a narrowing of democratic choice, we are being asked to choose between bad and worst, which is why many like myself refuse to play the game and instead vote for third parties). 

&gt; Best on national debt &amp; deficit?
Ed Miliband – 40%, Nigel Farage – 30%, Nicola Sturgeon – 18%, Natalie Bennett – 8%, Leanne Wood – 4% 
Labour had austerity-lite arguments and came out on top. Farage had even harder austerity rhetoric, and came second. The three arguing for ""an end to austerity"" came distant last.

Sturgeon, Bennet and Wood are all anti-austerity, so should be counted together. That's 30% who want an end to austerity, it's not a majority but it's a large minority, that means there are 30% of people who Labour are now to the right of. 30% also ties them with Nigel Farage, but Farage has a cult of personality, I don't think people who said he was best actually really want more austerity, they are just angry and the trust Farage to fix things for them. If/when UKIP get any power and vote for harsh austerity, their popularity will plummet.

&gt; People argue that being fiscally restrained is going to cause the collapse of support for Labour (or the Tories or Lib Dems) really are going to need to cite some sources. Labour are taking a reasonable, measured, pragmatic view on government borrowing, and I really can't see it causing devastating problems for them.

Have you read anything from Simon Wren-Lewis? He's an economics professor at Oxford University and also is quite transparent about his support for Labour, yet he often criticises their approach to austerity on [his blog](http://mainlymacro.blogspot.co.uk/), for example [here](http://mainlymacro.blogspot.co.uk/2014/09/labours-austerity-problem.html) he argues that Labours perceived weakness on economic competence was because they appeared confused and divided over austerity rather than because they hadn't committed to austerity, what they needed to do was come up with a plan and sell it to the public, that plan didn't need to be austerity-lite they could have argued for no austerity as various other parties have.

It's not possible to cite a source that shows how people are going to react to Labour austerity, since it hasn't happened yet, but the author does give some examples from other countries:

&gt;Greece’s dominant centre-left party implemented austerity and its vote collapsed from 43.9 per cent in 2009 to 4.7 per cent in 2015 – but Pasok’s fate is only an extreme form of the implosion threatening most European social democratic parties, from the German Social Democrats to the French Socialists.

When supposedly left-wing parties implement austerity which effects their base support worst of all (the poorest in society and public sector workers) it doesn't usually end well for them. An example from this country that's happening right now would be the Lib-Dems, their support has collapsed because they joined with the Tories and implemented austerity, what makes you think that the same isn't going to happen to Labour if/when they gain power and start to implement their own austerity?

null,false,c12345g,lfc68,,null,"There's only 1 team in the Bundesliga richer than Dortmund, meaning that Dortmund should theoretically be able to comfortably qualify for the CL every season. It also means that whenever Bayern has a bad year, Dortmund should have a shot at winning the title.

Chadli can score a great goal every now and then, but Eriksen will always be an important piece in Pochettino's midfield, regardless of the two behind him.

null,false,edent,null,null,null,"This boils down to two rather grim aspects.

1. How long do you expect to live?
2. How much money does living cost you each year?

Typically, [men in the UK live until 79](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy) - if you're a smoker, that will be lower.

Assuming you retire at 67, you've got 12 years to fund.  Although that could be significantly more.

So, what does it cost you to live?  Rent, food, heating, etc.  Obviously you don't need to travel to work any more, or buy work clothes - but you may need to buy, for example, a car suitable for any disabilities you may develop.

A basic rule of thumb is that you need roughly 50% of your salary to live in retirement.  Although that's normally predicated on having no or minimal housing costs.

You don't say what you earn, but for the sake of argument, let's say it is [the UK average wage of £26,000pa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_in_the_United_Kingdom).  

Assuming you qualify, the [UK State Pension is £6029.40 per year](https://www.gov.uk/state-pension/overview).

That means you need to find a way of generating £7,000 per year ((26k / 2) - 6k) in order to live comfortably.

At a *very* basic calculation, we can see that £7k for 12 years is £84,000.  You've already got £25k, so let's say that you need to raise **at least** another £60k before you retire.

£60,000 / (67 years - 47 years) = £3k per year.

That doesn't take into account inflation, the sort of pension you might take when you retire, unexpected bills, rate of return, living longer etc.

This is **not** financial advice.  Go and find a friendly IFA.  Explain what your plans are for retirement.  They'll help you work out exactly how much you need and how much you'll need to invest in order to make that happen.

Maybe you have forgotten but we weren't the only sides in for these players. Both spurs and united were in for lallana, and pochetinno also tried bringing in lovren to tottenham. I had no qualms with those transfers last summer except that we overpaid by 5m for both of them. Why did we overpay that much? Who knows, the board is responsible but for me there was nothing wrong with those two as targets. Lovren of a great season being hailed as one of the best defenders in the prem. People now saying fonte was the good player are revising history and discrediting lovren. Jose fonte was seen as a liability just two years ago in 12/13. Saying Fonte made lovren look good is some of the stupidest shit ive read this season. Lallana was the captain and star player of southampton. Yes we overpaid by huge amounts. No they were not the worst pieces of business ever. Say we got lovren for 14m and lallana for 19 last summer. I would've been over the moon and praised Ayre to no end. There is no fuckin point revising history just to make it fit your narrative. Saying players like them are mid table signings just to discredit the transfers is both unnecessary and inaccurate.

There are huge swathes of the third world where entire populations are in constant peril, famine in the horn of Africa, massacres in Nigeria, civil wars in the Middle East.

If we really sat here and took the attitude of playing some sort of PC version of the white man's burden then we would have to transplant the majority of people living in these troubled regions of the world onto our island. Never mind the fact that the number of people who want to make it across the sea to Southern Europe from North Africa via these routes is almost incalculable. And if we keep accepting them with open arms when they make their voyages, then more will climb onto boats and more will drown. Because they know that if they take the risk and make it across the water there is a fair chance that they will be able to stay, regardless of the circumstances they fled from.

I've lived in regions of the EU where many of these people wind up; I used to see them everyday. You couldn't move five feet without tripping over them, they weren't the guys working in the corner shops or the guys washing cars. They were the beggars, the streetwalkers and the shady guys selling fake Louis Vuitton around the tourist hotspots. They rarely have the paperwork, stability or education to find legitimate work in Europe. Unlike the working class Pole or Romanian with his high school diploma, mastery of three languages and strong cultural similarities to his adopted community. It sounds as callous as hell, but I know which individual I would more seriously consider hiring.

If we take these people in in greater numbers then more will come and more will die. And their blood will be on the hands of those who are soft on those who make it. There are some chunks of gold amongst the mud, but the majority of these individuals will be a burden. They are not EU citizens and the EU doesn't owe them a bloody thing.

In my mind the more logical way of improving the lives of the people hailing from these regions would be to assist in the stabilisation of these hazardous areas via extensive aid and *gentle* encouragement via political and diplomatic pressure on the corrupt governments and rogue elements which are so often the root cause of these episodes of turmoil in the third world.

Its all about how you measure success for me. Compared to last year, yeah this season has been a big anticlimax. But Compared to the state of the club when BR took over, it has been an unqualified success. 

After watching him recently for Barca, i cant believed i undervalued him when he played for us and i believed and still do believe Luis Suarez to be one of the top 10 strikers in the last 10 years (and he was brought in a day before we lost another one). Losing him was so much bigger than i think any of us thought at the time, perhaps disguised by on paper, good deals (Lovren, Can, Moreno etc). Not directly replacing Suarez with one or 2 good players was the right decision at the time. We used something like 14 different players in the last 15 games last season and by the end you could see the cost of fatigue on the players and the need for reinforcements in numbers was obvious and some of them costing 20 on paper was a mix of both worlds. People point at what Chelsea did. They bought in two absolutely sensational players to an already title contending squad and under Mourinho. Completely different circumstances. 

The age of the squad has been questioned, and its inconceivable that such a young squad could come close to winning the league. Except we did last year. As long as we see this year as progress, which it is, the pathway ahead is pretty bright imo. 

My only concern is making Liverpool an attractive to place to play football. The great players who move don't want to be a part of a project. If you are doing well in a league and move to the premier league you would want to make sure it was not a gamble. CL, a manager you can look up too and ultimately, lots of $$$ is what is attractive to players. If the fans are good then its a bonus. 
I feel this is where outside England, Rodgers loses us credibility. Benitez had a history of success in another country as well as in Europe and brought with him players who we are still praising him for bringing us. I just cannot see the coaching staff and the chair staff having that same pull power at the moment. 

People are talking about Klopp and i feel thats the only area where he would be an improvement on BR. Apart from that its a question of longevity for me and i have a feeling because Klopp is so young that Liverpool would be a stepping stone for him.

So if the formations are tight enough that gas can't flow through them, it's fairly unlikely that water or any other proppant is going to trickle through.

So long as the rest of the wellbore is cased to a sufficiently high standard (this is where proper regulations come in) then there's generally an acceptably low risk to drinking water.

You could always get a coach but it would take approximately 7 hours and it is, frankly, a grim way to travel and is best avoided.

However: UKIP aren't proposing to privatise the NHS. They never have. Farage (rightly) suggested we need to discuss the future of it. With a population pyramid like ours, and higher and higher life expectancy, the cost is only going to keep increasing. But they also rightly concluded that the NHS should stay free to all British citizens.

They're also not proposing banning immigration entirely (unlike what some people still seem to think) and if there's a need for nurses or doctors then the immigration system would allow for them to be brought in. 

But there are problems with it. I've met several staff who are not proficient in English which honestly is not very comforting and can be very dangerous, giving people the wrong dosage of medication for example. Which is why the controls they'd put in place would be a very good thing.

Most of the 'Rodgers out' brigade are citing his inability to capitalise on last season's 2nd place to build a squad that can challenge for the title a second time. Klopp won back-to-back league titles a couple of years ago (which is impressive considering how much more money Bayern Munich have) and have had some decent CL runs, but they're currently 9th in the Bundesliga. I'm pretty sure if we were 9th in the league that Rodgers would absolutely be out of a job this summer, if not already. 

I have a lot of respect for Klopp, but I don't see him being a definite step up from Rodgers in the way that someone like Ancelotti or Guardiola, or even potentially someone like Benitez would be. He's won some trophies, but he's hardly got a bulletproof track record of bringing success to clubs, and he's leaving a team currently sitting in the league below teams like Augsburg and TSG 1899 Hoffenheim - clubs that I doubt anyone without an interest in the Bundesliga has ever heard of (I only know them from stints there in FM). 

He did win the league for Dortmund twice, but then the Bundesliga is a one-horse race most seasons, and if Bayern Munich are having an off season it becomes pretty much anyone's game. On the other hand for the Premier League you're looking at Chelsea, Man City and Man Utd all having a poor season before it opens up to anyone else.

&gt;As my paper with Jonathan Portes suggests, the policy should have been to avoid cuts and to invest while interest rates were stuck at ‘zero’. In other words, the recovery takes priority, and the deficit should be dealt with after the recovery has been assured.

Basic Keynesian economics, of which Labour is an unashamed subscriber.

According to Wren-Lewis, cuts during the depth of a recession were a bad thing, but cuts once the economic recovery are underway are a good thing. Labour argued against the Tory austerity programme for much of the last 5 years (essentially following the Darling plan of the last election, in rhetoric terms). However the economy has finally (after much delay, thanks to Osbourne's incompetence) started to recover, with growth beginning to pick up in the last year. It is absolutely right and proper (and in line with Wren-Lewis' arguments) that we should expect to start bringing the deficit down over the coming period of growth. Labour's targets are sufficiently generous that they can afford to keep the cuts to a minimum for the first few years and still hit their targets by the next election. Also, capital spending (""investment"") is not affected by Labour's plans.

The anti-austerity parties were talking sense during the depths of the recession, but by sticking to the same rhetoric for 7 years (counting from the crash) they've essentially become anti-Keynesian. They need to update their plans as the situation on the ground changes; instead, they're still busy fighting yesterday's war.

The situation in Greece is utterly different; it was foolish when the Tories were saying ""we could be like Greece"" as a terrible threat to justify their barmy economic policy, and it's just as foolish to use them as an analogy now. Pasok suffered because they were in charge for a seemingly unending, soul-crushing economic collapse that is still going on to this day. Is anyone arguing that Labour's pragmatic, middle-of-the-road policy is going to drive the UK into a decline with no end?

Exactly but that's our problem. Our best players have been Coutinho and Can but you'd be mad to suggest Coutinho should even be on the PFA shortlist or that every team above us has a better version of Can.

You're right about our club stature too. We have to recognise we are not what we once were and we haven't been for a long time.

null,false,AnxiousMo-Fo,,Labour | Check out /r/LabourUK!,null,"You're right, I was overshooting with 'rigidly enforce'. What I was thinking of when I wrote it was, variously, the question Sturgeon got from the Scottish bloke whose son wasn't eligible for free education in Scotland and various things I've read and heard from SNP members up to and including Alec Salmond, implying or outright stating that a failure to support Scottish separatism is 'unScottish'. To suggest that 'to be a Scot' is 'to have a certain set of opinions about Scottish autonomy' is problematic.

'Dated notion of national identity' referred to a couple of things. I think, broadly, national ties and identities are less strong than they used to be, and that's a good thing -- I would have thought you'd agree, as someone who's very supportive of the EU. Yet the SNP's worldview is predicated on the idea that having, at any point, been a nation gives you a right to self-determination in perpetuity. This is obviously conservative in the literal sense, if not outright reactionary.

Sovereignty is obviously a tricky concept but it ties into what I was suggesting before about historical 'rights' to 'self-rule'. I find the SNP's position on this enormously problematic, in that they're furious about being 'controlled' by Westminster but very keen to sign up to every other international or global institution of which the UK is a part. What is it about Westminster in particular that they think is so problematic that the EU and NATO are immune to?

So I believe nationalism cannot be progressive because it insists that the best way solve problems is to build barriers between people and break off into ever smaller units. Not only that, many or most nationalisms, including the SNP's brand, base their claim not on a general human right to self-determination but on a historical and/or arbitrary dividing line between 'them' and 'us'. Again, I'd suggest that this was by definition conservative and also goes against the general, positive trend of fewer national ties and boundaries based on nationhood or citizenship.",null,0,null,1429523529,null,0,false,0,cqich5q,null,t3_32x7i8,null,t1_cqich5q,null,t1_cqfx6bt,null,null,null,1432494291,null,3,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,3,null

AIUI it's not quite that simple.  Someone who is both employed and self-employed is potentially liable to class 1, class 2 and class 4 NI.

You can opt-out of class 2 if your self-employed profit is below £5965 in the current tax year.  There is also some relief to ensure that a person with both employed and self-employed income doesn't pay significantly more NI than they would on the same amount of income from a single source.

But it's not as simple as PAYE = no class 2.

&gt; For example two people buy a widget for £10 from China and sell it on Ebay for £12. Fees aside, the person who is not VAT rated walks away with £2. The person who is VAT rated will either have to walk away with £1.67 or increase the price by 40p to get £2.

This is true, but saying ""fees aside"" ignores a rather crucial difference.  eBay fees are VATable which means a VAT-registered vendor effectively pays less because of their ability to reclaim that VAT.

You would not dream of asking a fox to look after the henhouse or a temperance campaigner to run a brewery or Attila the Hun to work as a doorkeeper for the Roman senate – and no one in their right mind would enter into a contract with a bunch of voracious weevils to protect the lovely old timbers in the tower of the local church. Would they?
Any such course of action would be totally nuts. So can someone tell me why in the name of all that is holy there are some apparently rational people who are even contemplating the elevation of the Scottish Nationalist Party to a position of effective dominance in the government of the United Kingdom – an entity that they are sworn to destroy?
That is their charter, their aim, their ambition, their mission statement: to overturn last year’s referendum, and to break us up. They want to end Britain, to decapitate Britannia, to cause a constitutional upheaval that would gravely weaken this country, a rupture that has provoked horror in Britain’s friends around the world – and a silent chuckle among those who do not wish us quite so well.
And yet it is now clear that it is only with the help of the SNP – a party that is literally anti-British – that Ed Miliband can have any hope of governing this country. The Labour implosion in Scotland means that his chances of forming a majority government are now put at less than 1 per cent.
If Miliband is to occupy Downing Street, he will have to do it either by means of a formal coalition with Salmond/Sturgeon, or with an arrangement called confidence and supply, by which the Scots Nats agree to help knock his legislation through the Commons.
It is therefore obvious to every serious political analyst that he would be in many ways the plaything of the SNP. Unless he has the support of that 40-plus bloc of Scottish secessionists, he will be stymied. If Miliband somehow manages to form a minority government, he will be peeping from Alec Salmond’s sporran like a baffled baby kangaroo. He would be the vacillating Macbeth, pushed hither and yon by Lady Macbeth, in the form of Nicola Sturgeon.
Did you see her the other night, telling him to man up, to screw his courage to the sticking place – to do what she told him to do because “you are not strong enough on your own”? The awful truth is that she is right. Without her help and her say-so, and without the support of Salmond and his troops in the Commons, there is not a single bill that Labour could get through. It is a recipe for chaos; and worse than chaos – because the SNP has changed over the years.
The reason they have lampreyed the life out of Labour in Scotland is that they have become ever more Left wing. Miliband is already the most Left-wing Labour leader since Michael Foot, promoting an agenda that seems to be avowedly hostile to wealth creation and “predatory” capitalism. The SNP are Lefties on steroids. They want to abandon any attempt to get the deficit under control, and indeed the Treasury has calculated that they would borrow another £148 billion.
They think taxes are far too low in Britain, and would seek new “progressive” taxes on top of what Labour is already proposing. They would scrap Trident, denuding Britain of its nuclear deterrent and sending future prime ministers naked into the conference chamber. The SNP would junk all attempts to reform the welfare system – even though they have the support of most voters in this country, and indeed most Labour voters.
They seem to dislike anything to do with America or free trade, and so would ditch the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, even though the deal would be good for the UK economy. On many of these issues they would of course be opposed, initially, by many Labour MPs. But what could they do? Unless Miliband plays ball, he will be powerless to legislate. He would lose the confidence of parliament, and he would be chucked out.
Yes, he will be sitting in the driving seat, pretending to be steering the car – but all the time he will have clever Nicola next to him, whispering in his ear, and perpetually yanking the steering wheel to the Left. Eventually there will be another terrible crash, just as there was in 2008/9.
But why should the SNP care a hoot about that? There is a grim sense in which the worst outcome for the UK is also – for a party that wants to break up the UK – the best.
Miliband’s proposed deal with the Scots Nats is like the fable of the frog that agrees to carry the scorpion across the river. In the end he will get stung – because that is the nature of the beast.
The risk is that by the end of this calamitous partnership there will be so many people in England who are cheesed off by the SNP’s behaviour that they will be only too happy to bid Scotland goodbye; and anybody thinking of voting Ukip should realise that by putting in a Labour/SNP alliance they are going to turn the UK into the Former UK, and their party will have to be called FUKIP.
Keep the Tories and you keep the Beefeaters guarding the Tower; you let farmers protect their chickens with their own shotguns; you keep out Attila and other roaming Eastern European criminals with tougher immigration controls; you keep Britain’s booming breweries and distilleries exporting overseas with ever-greater confidence; you repair the church tower with the VAT refund introduced by George Osborne – and as for the crèche that was in danger of being run by Herod, you fund ever better child care with the 30-hour free care announced in the manifesto.

I entirely agree with you on BTL growing out of all proportion and it essentially being, as with so many things, wealth transfer from this generation to the elderly and rich, but just completely abolishing BTL would cause a housing crisis ten times worse than the one we have.

IMO we need a first choice striker, to play alongside or instead of Sturridge. We need an experienced and quality RB, to allow Flanno and Manquillo (if we keep him) to develop. We need an experienced and quality LB, to allow Moreno to develop. We need another top quality CM, to add some goals/creativity to our midfield, and potentially depending on Lucas' situation, we may need a DM as well to allow Can to develop in that role.

I'd like the squad to look something like this by the end of the window:

GK: Migs, Jones or new keeper

DF: New RB, Flanno, Manquillo, Skrtel, Sakho, Lovren, Ilori, Moreno, New LB

MF: Hendo, Allen, Lucas, Can, New CM, Potentially New DM

AM/Wing: Sterling, Ibe, Coutinho, Lallana, Markovic

ST: Sturridge, New ST, Balotelli, Origi

That is a tight, talented squad, with a good blend of youth and experience. Any additional youth players like Sinclair or Ojo will obviously be assessed.

The important part is that all of the new players have to be improvements on the players in these positions.

Banning BTL mortgages effectively restricts landlording to a smaller set of people who are either spectacularly cash rich or who were lucky enough to buy before this legislation. I'm not sure that's an improvement.

Assuming that this then reduces competition for houses (as fewer people can buy to let and people generally only need one house), prices might fall.

I would prefer expanded social housing schemes and rent controls aimed at minimising accommodation costs for tenants. This would probably involve an effort to make letting an equal or less rewarding investment than responsible investment funds.

This would divert money to more useful areas of the economy by moving money out of houses (where it generally benefits landowners and mortgage lenders) and into proper investment that gives governments and companies money to grow.

1. Not voting **is not a protest**, it's apathy. Turning up and **spoiling your ballot** is a protest and will get counted.
2. Preferably of course you'd vote for someone. If you think they're all shit, **vote for the least shit** one. You're probably not going to agree with every policy of every party but there is definitely one that's right for you.
3. Even if you're in a safe seat, your vote still counts for *something*. If the Greens for example get 10% of the popular vote but win no seats, that is very significant, it still gives them more of a voice in politics (see Ukip). Potentially it is also a catalyst for voting reform (i.e. proportional representation).
4. If you don't vote, politicians will not care about your issues. From Armando Iannucci: ""In 2010 80% of over-65s voted + only 47% of 18-24yr olds.

What's in it for the SNP to bring down a (potential) Labour administration?

It would suggest to people that voting SNP for Westminster was rather pointless, as they're unable to work with either major UK-wide party.

BTL just seems like a pretty base scheme of getting your tenants to buy your property for you.

Why should BTLs continue to be allowed?

Even if prices fell, given that it costs ~£50k to rebuild a house from scratch in the event of total destruction, why should that house be worth £190k? Free markets only take you so far before the whole set-up breeds contempt and economic instability.

I'm not opposed to landlords because there will always be those who can't afford to buy, be it because they are too poor or too uneducated to reign in control of their finances enough to save.

Exhausts are a good point. I had a car that I bought at 3 years old with 90k on the clock. I did a further 75k in 4 years. At 6 years old and approximately 150,000 the original exhaust back box finally fell off and without any warning. The rest of it was still on the car when I sold it at 165k although with a new back box. The reason for that is because it did long journeys so all the condensation that built up on a night and rotted the exhaust was burned off. If you have a car that only does short journeys this doesn't happen. You can spot them easily in a morning by the water dribbling out the exhaust as they set off.

You're coming about as equally stubborn for the sake of Rodgers. Losses, and specially like yesterday will grind gears. Not just the loss, the manner of the loss too.

Nothing. That's the problem. Absolutely nothing apart from talking, talking and more talking. When the manager of LFC talks shit like this:

&gt; ""Swansea's play-off final was the biggest game for me and always will be so it is not about pipping it - it would be exactly the same if we were to get to a Champions League final,"" said Rodgers of his success with the south Wales club in 2011.

I think the reality is that Rodgers is a young manager and whilst yes he will one day come good, who is willing to wait the 5 or 10 years it takes to happen? He has traits that work against him that have been present every year so far even as recently as the last game, there is no reason to believe he will not be as inept at in game management next year. As long as he is as stubborn as he is without world class players like Suarez getting top 4 is a pipe dream unless other teams throw it away. United and Arsenal certainly look to be strengthening, top 4 next season will be a harder ask than it was this year. Realistically i think you're looking at 2 or 3 years under Rodgers for another good shout at top 4. We've been pretty wank in the domestic cups under Rodgers so I've no illusions about winning one with him anytime soon. For me the worst aspect of Rodgers is the idea we might have to wait a few seasons for CL, just to plummet out again because he has no experience in the CL. We should have walked our group this year in reality, we couldn't really have asked for better, a team that's never been in the CL before and a team from a league where they are the only team worth acknowledging even exists...

I don't know. I'm not Rodgers out, but he is shit in the transfer market so i'm not anticipating a great summer to turn this around.

I think moneyball was abandoned a while ago. Lambert, Lallana, Lovren are not moneyball signings.  Lambert is ageing and and the other 2 were bought at the age a moneyball signing should be sold.  There was a clear intent to move away from an undiluted moneyball approach.

&gt; We need a class striker - simple

I agree wholeheartedly.  Following recent tabloid gossip linking us with Falcao i found myself paying special attention to him on saturday against Chelsea.  It is well known that he has a very specific set of strengths and weaknesses, which i won't get into here, but i would happily take him - except he would expect 2 to 3 times the weekly salary Raheem is aiming for and Champions League football.  We definitely need a superstar striker and if we only buy one player this year, it needs to be someone like Falcao.  I just don't know if it will be possible to get someone like that.

&gt; Rodgers needs a Plan B, and a Plan C.

Our boss has tactical failings as we frequently note and bemoan but he is also highly innovative and a top-rate coach.  Yesterday he tried a 3-4-3, 4-2-3-1 and 4-3-3.  That enough plans or do we need a plan D as well?  The problem yesterday wasn't the lack of alternative plans, it was how he implemented and executed those plans.  He clearly had an off-day, he's had too many of them this year.

All-in-all, i agree with the tone of your post though not some of your individual points.  I like Brendan, i want to see him do well for us, i thought he could have been our Fergie or the new Shankly.  I accept that there were many factors he had to battle against this season (loss of Saurez, hangover from last year, fading superstar captain) that were beyond his control, but the last month have knocked the stuffing out of me.  If there is no managerial change in the summer Brendan will be under immense pressure next year from the press and fans right from the outset.  Any early dip or loss of form will be a disaster for him.  I don't want to see him get fired, but he needs to deliver something next season or the calls for his head will become deafening

Especially given how badly Dortmund have dropped off the pace this season.

Who is to say he didn't just luckily get a few signings that went better than expected and won some trophies off of that, in the same way people have argued that Rodgers just lucked into having Suarez almost winning him a title last season. In which case there's no guarantee he'd do any better than our current league position.

There are managers who have won trophies at multiple clubs and seem to be able to consistently deliver wherever they are. I don't think Klopp is in that class of manager (neither is Rodgers), and I'd be wary that managers outside that class are always being judged on short-term record rather than long-term record.

This isn't the relevant point of the issue, the relevant point is if you raise wages, then you raise prices, prices to everyone, the poor and the rich, in the case of taxation it is a heavier burden on the rich than the poor, what you do is turn it from a stepped payment system to a consumption tax. A consumption tax on everyone just like VAT, a tax with the conservative government raised, and raised for several reasons, one is because it effects the poor as much as the rich, and secondly it is essentially a stealth tax, unlike income tax or national insurance that give you a number amount on your payslip. 

Thirdly unlike VAT, it would effect all goods, effecting the poor more, VAT isn't charged on food or clothing, this price increase would directly effect that in the case of supermarkets. 

Then there comes a fourth point, should working in a Supermarket really be seen as a job for life with a good pay grade? This is forgetting the fact that a lot of Supermarkets already pay above minimum wage by 10% or more, such as Tesco, and Aldi even more, but many are also reducing their benefits to new staff to save money. My point about should it be a good pay grades is that if you make it £8 an hour that is £15,600, that is lab technician money, £9 that is 17,550, £10 is starting graduate wage, for entirely unskilled labour and it isn't like there isn't good money in retail management, there has to be to keep anyone vaguely competent in the places, because essentially you just have to deal with a bunch of teenagers and idiots all day.",null,0,null,1429527818,null,0,false,0,cqidex2,null,t3_335lrc,null,t1_cqidex2,null,t1_cqiaeij,null,null,null,1432494801,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Like others have said in this post it looks like there is a noticeable delay between seeing the car in front come to a stop (or reduce in speed really dramatically) and starting to brake, and then a very noticeable delay in slowing down. Are you using both brakes at the same time here? If so, were there any lockups?

I frequently use rear and front brake to give maximum braking power just when riding around normally - not in an emergency scenario. Muscle memory has now made it so that I get both brakes on when I have *needed* to, not just the one. I don't stamp on the rear brake but ease it on as a supplement to the front brake. It helps knock the forward momentum back a slug before I come on with the front. I remember reading/seeing somewhere that braking should always be preempted with the rear brake, as you shift momentum to the back wheel instead of the front wheel which can help avoid lockups in the ice. I'm not sure of the science here but I have had to do a few sharp stops so far and without the rear brake, I think I would have had an accident.

From experience, I can say that having a pillion on the bike can be an odd and sometimes distracting experience. I have an intercom kit on my helmet and so does my pillion, and I very rarely talk or have a conversation when in built up environments where there is lots of traffic or where I have to concentrate on a bend. I dedicate as much of my concentration to the bike as I can. I have, more than once, been caught out and had to apply brakes suddenly because I was nattering.

null,false,DefluousBistup,null,null,null,"&gt;Lord Rothermere was a friend of Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler, and directed the Mail's editorial stance towards them in the early 1930s.[32][33] Rothermere's 1933 leader ""Youth Triumphant"" praised the new Nazi regime's accomplishments, and was subsequently used as propaganda by them.[34] In it, Rothermere predicted that ""The minor misdeeds of individual Nazis would be submerged by the immense benefits the new regime is already bestowing upon Germany"". Journalist John Simpson, in a book on journalism, suggested that Rothermere was referring to the violence against Jews and Communists rather than the detention of political prisoners.[35]

&gt;Rothermere and the Mail were also editorially sympathetic to Oswald Mosley and the British Union of Fascists.[36] Rothermere wrote an article entitled ""Hurrah for the Blackshirts"" in January 1934, praising Mosley for his ""sound, commonsense, Conservative doctrine"",[37] and pointing out that: ""Young men may join the British Union of Fascists by writing to the Headquarters, King's Road, Chelsea, London, S.W.""[38]

&gt;The Spectator condemned Rothermere's article commenting that, ""..the Blackshirts, like the Daily Mail, appeal to people unaccustomed to thinking. The average Daily Mail reader is a potential Blackshirt ready made. When Lord Rothermere tells his clientele to go and join the Fascists some of them pretty certainly will.""[39]

&gt;The paper's support ended after violence at a BUF rally in Kensington Olympia later that year.[40] Mosley and many others thought Rothermere had responded to pressure from Jewish businessmen who it was believed had threatened to stop advertising in the paper if it continued to back an anti-Semitic party.[41]",null,0,null,1429528036,null,0,false,0,cqidgso,null,t3_337wec,null,t1_cqidgso,null,t1_cqid5hm,null,null,null,1432494827,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

null,false,grogipher,,Bu Chòir!,null,"&gt; What I was thinking of when I wrote it was, variously, the question Sturgeon got from the Scottish bloke whose son wasn't eligible for free education in Scotland 

This is a prime example of how the SNP **aren't** sticking to outdated forms of nationality from the 19th Century. They're *not* about being ""Scottish-enough"" or ""born here"" or any of the stuff you'd hear from other folk. That's a perfect example of modern, civic nationalism in that it's all based on residency, not nationality. The bloke's son wasn't eligible because he didn't live in Scotland. If he lived here, he'd have been eligible, regardless if he were from Scotland, England or Estonia.. 

&gt; I would have thought you'd agree, as someone who's very supportive of the EU. Yet the SNP's worldview is predicated on the idea that having, at any point, been a nation gives you a right to self-determination in perpetuity.

I absolutely am pro-European integration, but still think that Scotland should be a memberstate in its own right, distinct from the rest of the UK. It's not about history (you'll never hear the Scottish Government harping on about historical stuff), it's about the future. The SNP believe that the polity of the people of Scotland (note: not the Scottish people), is sufficiently distinctive enough to warrant secession from the rest of the UK. I believe in the fundamental of all peoples in the right to self-determination absolutely, in perpetuity. The people in Scotland voted to remain in the UK, so that's what will happen. It's not my preference, but that's democracy. It's not based on historical slights at all(indeed, you'd hear more historical references from the ""no"" camp""), it's a looking-forward, what's-the-best-deal-for-our-representation thing. 

The SNP aren't isolationist, they just want Scotland to be like every other similar country.. In the EU, in the UN, in NATO (although that one was a pretty close vote), and whatever other bodies. They want to work with all of their friends and neighbours on the international stage - including the other nations on these islands. I don't think you can say being in the UK is analogous to being in the EU/UN/NATO/Whatever though? They're supranational powers, dealing with how we deal with other nations, not internally. There's a difference between being in the UK and having 26 bishops from a foreign kirk voting upon your own domestic laws, and being in a trade-members-club where all the nations get a say in what the rules are. The EU facilitates independent nations working together for the greater good, it's not one country with one centralised power centre, divorced from the reality of life for people on the fringes. If the EU started doing absolutely crazy things like Westminster does, I'd advocate leaving too.. 

The SNP argue that Scotland's voice should be heard in these organisations, just today there's the UK delegation at the CFP discussions in Europe, but Scotland's ministers are locked out, while unelected peers who probably couldn't locate Scotland's fishing waters on a map fights our corner. Fishing is a prime example of something that isn't a UK priority, but is a Scottish priority, it's a bedrock of our economy, but in the words of the UK it's economic ""peanuts"".

&gt; So I believe nationalism cannot be progressive because it insists that the best way solve problems is to build barriers between people and break off into ever smaller units. 

This is absolutely, demonstrably untrue. If Scotland were to secede from the UK but join the EU, what possible barriers would be created? 

&gt; Not only that, many or most nationalisms, including the SNP's brand, base their claim not on a general human right to self-determination but on a historical and/or arbitrary dividing line between 'them' and 'us'. 

This is an absolutely baseless, unfounded assertion altogether. Look at an electoral map of the UK and tell me the line is ""arbitrary"".

United did the same, fall out the top 4? How do you get back? Sign a bunch of youth? No, sign proven talent, immediately back into the top 4. The evidence is pretty clear that in the modern age of football money talks, and before anyone comes along saying ""Oh well we don't have the money for it"" bullshit, Lovren, Lallana, Markovic are all expensive signings, we have players like Johnson on 6 figure wages. We have the money we're just shit at using it e.g. last summer where we spent over £100 mill and got very little to show for it this year. Hell, we've spent more than Arsenal since Rodgers came here and their signings are still streets ahead of most of ours.

People need to stop kidding themselves and look at things objectively and rationally. People go round pretending we've got players on a fiver a week and we traded Benfica a can of lentil beans for Markovic. It's horse shit, wake up.

""Everybody assumes that to get top players you have to spend more money, which while generally true, ignores the success of teams like Arsenal, Atletico and Dortmound who have bought quality players (albeit not World class players) for considerably less

Santi Cazorla £20,000,000 

Nacho Monreal £8,300,000

 Laurent Koscielny £10,000,000


Aaron Ramsey £5,000,000
Similarly Atletico who have too replace many strikers like Liverpool (Costa, Aguero, Forlan,) and Dortmound, Valencia, have all used their money better than Liverpool over the years. Your biggest failure was not displacing Arsenal when you had the chance when they had no money, because now I fear Liverpool are finished as a big club.

2)Once they get good they'll want to stay


But what in reality will happen as Arsene found out was when your young players get good they leave (e.g. Nasri, Clichy, Fabregas, Song, Hleb etc).

Lennon, simply put, lacks end product. If he starts for an entire season you can statistically guesstimate that he produces 10 goals/assists combined, we have years of data showing this. That comes out to a goal/assist every 3-4 games (during our golden period even!). It's simply not enough when there are younger, cheaper and more productive guys coming through. 

His pressing game was worse than Lamela's, his end product worse than Chadli and his wage higher than Townsend. Age wise he is also on the wrong end of all those mentioned wingers. 

My understanding is that Everton are also playing him through the middle more than out on the wing, are we going to really consider shifting Eriksen for Lennon? Of course not.

This is the line Cameron trotted out on Marr at the weekend, that the increase in foodbank use is because it was only under this government that Job Centres started referring people to food banks. Marr retorted by quoting [the Trussell Trust figure of only 3% of food bank users coming from Job Centre referrals](https://youtu.be/LxVdseY5qu8).

&gt;The biggest single cause of using foodbanks is delay in receiving benefits. Under this Government there are 92 per cent of payments processed on time. When Labour were last in power it was 86 per cent.

He's right that, again according to the Trussell Trust, [benefit delays are the biggest cause of foodbank use](http://www.trusselltrust.org/mid-year-stats-2014-2015).

* **Landslide in favour of staying in the EU (e.g. 75% in favour of staying):** Maybe it will shut them up for a while. They will lie low and wait for the next big ""EU scandal"" or more steps towards EU integration before claiming the ""rules of the game have changed"" and that ""the public deserve to be consulted again"" as the situation now is ""very different from the one X years ago"". Or *maybe* they do fizzle out, become a minority party with no hope of any real success and become forgotten about (like the BNP).

* **Convincing victory in favour of staying in the EU (e.g. 60% vote to stay):** The fact that UKIP only needs to swing 11% of voters towards the anti EU platform will make them more enthusiastic. People will be more committed as they know victory is possible. As above, they will claim they are happy to not have a referendum for another generation, but will fabricate any excuse to say that circumstances demand one sooner.

* **Close call in Favour of staying (e.g. 52% in favour of staying):** As above but even more so. They know if they force a referendum at the right point then they can win.

* **Any option voting to leave the EU, even by one vote:** Job complete. After that result the UK will HAVE to leave the EU and there will be no going back.

I believe the same for the SNP above too. You can't end UKIP by holding a referendum any more than you can end the SNP by holding one. Both parties are fundamentally built upon what amounts to, in my opinion, completely faulty logic and reasoning to perform an action purely for ideological reasons rather than what is best for the country. 

With these sorts of scenarios you simply can't win by holding referendums, because you have to ""be lucky"" every single time but they only have to be lucky once. Without demolishing the actual root cause of their support you can't end the tensions and uncertainty as there will always be calls for more referendums. The citizens of Quebec nearly ended up independent from Canada after multiple referendums, and it was only when people were faced with the very real prospect of being independent that they went out, learnt the facts that the independence movement lost support.

The only way to combat them is to go for the root cause, which is to educate people on the topics so they know the real facts. There will always be a core group of voters who will support them no matter what, but I feel a lot of their supporters are mostly misinformed.

how does that give them a voice? what benefits or influence does 10% of the votes get you when you don't have a seat

What part of my post do you disagree with? I don't think I'm disagreeing with you much.

&gt; BTL just seems like a pretty base scheme of getting your tenants to buy your property for you.

It's liquidity to buy an expensive asset that you can then make money from. In that sense it's just lending. The problem as I see it is that buy to let landlords have a strong profit motive and a captive audience to exploit (everyone needs somewhere to live and we don't have surplus housing).

Because housing is essential, I think it needs to be tightly regulated by the state so that we can promote properties (excuse the pun) in the housing market that are globally desirable rather than the locally desirable (local to landowner, generally) properties that profit motives promote.

Desirable global properties and possible methods: increased income equality through cheaper rents, better quality of life through better accommodation and better relations with landlords.

I think you are forgetting that he has recently joined the team, not a lot of players adapt to a new team in just a day.  Yeah, He got matches when the whole team was in poor form, he was then the scapegoat because BR doesn't know how to handle the media and then he was dropped from the team in November. Then in December when we play the Mancs, he was subbed on, he could've scored a hat trick that day if De Gea hadn't saved all of his shots and those 3 goals could've equalized or won us the game. What would be people be saying about Balotelli then? He had a good performance but as I stated in my previous comment, he was dropped for 3 month. 3 MONTHS. Do you know what that does to a players mentality? And during those 3 months he wasn't even being picked for the sub's! BR decided that he wasn't even worth being a sub. 

OK Henderson could've taken the penalty but would you really pick him over Balo to have taken it? Balotelli is really good at taking penalties and as I stated, we were 0-0 and this was in the late minutes of the match, his penalty gave us a 1-0 lead in the second leg, and agai, in the second leg he created so many opportunities for both Sturridge and Sterling but neither of them could do anything with those chances and we lost the game due to penalties and as a matter a fact, did you also forget that BR subbed off Balotelli instead of keeping him on?

One big problem - I will now call it beach-footballer syndrome. Beach footballer (or same would go to ""freestyle footballer"") has great technical skills that he can manipulate football with and be the best on the sand but he just isn't able to play 11v11 football on the grass. 

Balotelli is technically great player and can pull off crazy skills that are little use to us on the pitch. Overhead kicks, shots from dead-ball situation, improvised skills like rabonas, shoulder passes and similar - we don't need them to play football and I'm slowly starting to think that he just lacks football intelligence. 

He doesn't know how to play 11v11, not literally but he doesn't know how to be useful for a team that needs all 11 to actively participate. I had a problem that was maybe something similar. As a kid I only played 5v5 football and when I went to 11v11 it was a shock. It's nothing alike for me. It's completely different game. It took years before I got anywhere near used to it.

On the pitch we need: 

* strikers to move. He's just so static and he doesn't know what to do after he passes to someone. Too often he just stands there and waits for the ball outside the box after making a pass. He has to attack the penalty area, but he doesn't.

* strikers to press. That's done to death I think. He's not on the same wavelength with others when pressing.

Too often he plays like there's him and the ball. We rarely see him playing with other players. I'm not talking about straight-forward passes. Combining with others, making himself available to others to combine with him. It just isn't happening on the pitch.

Summary of his flaws: lack of movement, lack of proper pressing, lack of teamplay, lack of football intelligence. None of these are technical skills. For example Sterling has a huge fundamental flaw in his technical skills - he's unable to shoot. He can surely cope without it - shoots less, relies on finishes from short range or something like that, he just adapts his game. However, Balotelli almost doesn't have shortcomings of technical skills and that's very rare for a footballer. But I fear that his shortcomings are in his head which is far harder to compensate for.

No, they said *'The least shit'* not the least shit out of 2.

&gt;how does that give them a voice? what benefits or influence does 10% of the votes get you when you don't have a seat

Exactly working towards the erosion of the binary choice you've just been bitching about. 3rd parties have no chance of winning 'cause no one will vote for them. No one will vote for them because they have no chance of winning. Only one way to have any chance to break that circle is to vote for them anyway. Also, parties do not have to get power to influence the ruling parties. Just look at UKIP currently. The other factor I'd like to add to Disgruntled__Goat's post is that for minor parties votes can mean getting their deposit back.

It's not seen as one. Spoiling your ballot is a clear message. Though the best protest is voting for a better party.

&gt; That kind of thinking is exactly why government has been a binary choice for decades

How so? There are more than 2 choices on the ballot paper. For many people the ""least shit one"" is not Labour/Conservative.

&gt; how does that give them a voice? what benefits or influence does 10% of the votes get you when you don't have a seat

Look at how much influence Ukip has had in the past 5 years without a single MP. There is also the argument that it makes a difference in forming the government, e.g. if Tories have 300 seats and Labour have 280 seats but the popular vote, and can form a coalition, it's more likely to be seen as legitimate.

Sadly, you're unlikely to have 'patient choice' with regards to a physiotherapy service.  Physiotherapy is a community health service (CHS) and historically, patient choice only applies to in hospital services (ie where to have your operation, where to receive outpatient department procedures etc).

There are moves to change this - which should have started taking effect from 01/04, but as it's the NHS, it'll be a slooooow move.

As to why there's this distinction made - well, it's complicated (ish).  Traditionally, CHS (including physiotherapy) were very locally based, eg district nurses, home visiting teams etc.  It would be too much to expect patients able to chose for a home visiting team based miles and miles away, when there was a local option.  Also, CHS organisations were 'new' in 2010(ish) - and it was felt that they needed a period of stability to get up and running, so they were ring fenced to deal with a set geographic area of patients.

None of the above is really relevant to physiotherapy though (and London is a also a bit of a special case, with so many services in close proximity), but it ended up being covered by the same rules as other CHS.

""Borussia Dortmund boss Jurgen Klopp says he could see himself managing an English club because he can speak the language, but refused to confirm whether he has been approached by a Premier League side.""


http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30207942


The important thing is new ideas, not money,"" Klopp once said. 

**""You always want to be the team that can beat the one with more money.""**


This is something that the German had made a habit of. He set the trend for the likes of Simeone and Brendan Rodgers in managing feats that were supposed to be way beyond their finances. 

Dortmund's successive titles between 2010 and 2012 were among the greatest achievements in the modern European game, as they levelled Bayern and so many other sides.

If you actually look at their term in Holyrood they've cut more from the Scottish NHS than the big bad evil Tories have. These guys are a single minded party on a single mission: Scottish Independence. They've got no interest in your left leaning values on the outskirts of London. They have made this manifesto because they calculate it offers them the best chance of Independence, which is ultimately what their party is about. They think that in order to achieve that they need to be ""palatable"" to left leaning English voters... like you. But don't be fooled, they've not got your interests at heart or even the interests of the Scottish... they are bent on Independence, it's their *raison d'etre*. They will do things that hurt peoples lives both in England and Scotland if they calculate that it is more likely to result in Independence at the soonest possible point. It's like a very ugly *""for the greater good""* mentality. I really think the SNP are one of the most malicious and malignant forces in British politics.

Maybe, but even if ""Scotland"" became independent and left the UK before the UK left the EU (which would be a big IF) rUK would still be in the same boat.

&gt; A statement has been released by Brighton and Hove City Council.

&gt; ""A fire has been extinguished at Hove Town Hall. East Sussex Fire Service was called to Hove Town Hall shortly before 1pm today when smoke was seen on the roof of the building. Hove Town Hall is currently being renovated and only a few staff and building contractors were inside at the time. Everyone was immediately evacuated and no one has been harmed. The source of the fire is believed to be an electrical fault with a solar panel on the roof. An investigation is underway. Those staff based at Hove Town Hall have now re-entered the building following clearance from the Fire Service at 1.30pm today. Brighton &amp; Hove City Council will check all solar panels on all council buildings following this incident.

Quite apart from that, the numbers arriving are *staggering*. 200,000 made it to Italy last year with 1,500 dead; but this year it's been 10,000 in the last week alone, with more than a thousand dead - and it isn't even summer yet. 

Leaving them to drown is inhumane beyond belief, but making it easier for people to arrive will exacerbate an already overwhelming problem. We'd soon be talking millions upon millions taking to the boats, and tens of thousands more drowning. And the EU would be overwhelmed.

This is not just Italy's problem. This is a pan-European issue (most migrants get the fuck out of Italy as soon as they can because the Italian economy is fucked) but Italy, which is broke, is being forced to deal with it practically alone. 

It's a shocking problem. I don't know the answer. The only thing I can think of as a solution is some form of benign deterrence: maybe divide up anyone who arrives between all EU member countries. (Italy has some camps to deal with them and they are already full to overflowing.) Each state gives them conditions that are humane, but nothing more, and deports anyone they can within the confines of European human rights laws. Whatever happens, we have got to stand with the Italians on this.

Aside from anything else, it's also psychologically devastating for the residents of Sicily and Lampadusa.

It's easier for coalitions/confidence and supply (or whatever we're calling it this week) governments to combine positive policies than try to adjust each others polices; here's an example:

* Party A wants to cut the cost of education for everyone.

* Party B wants to introduce special grants for gifted students. 

So the easy way to ""negotiate"" that into policy is to simply combine the ideas and pass them both, so the cost of education gets cut for all students, and gifted students get an even larger cut. 

The problem comes when you do what the SNP are trying to do, which is actually alter labour policy in fairly crucial areas... like this;

* Labour are committed to renewing trident. 

* The SNP are commited to NOT renewing trident. 

So getting around that is actually going to be very fucking tricky. Basically, somebody is going to get what they want, and somebody isn't. Someone will be a winner and someone will be a loser... that's very challenging.

&gt;

&gt;__Entryism__ (also referred to as __entrism__, occasionally as __enterism__) is a [political strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_strategy) in which an organisation or state encourages its members or supporters to join another, usually larger organisation in an attempt to expand influence and expand their ideas and program. In situations where the organization being ""entered"" is hostile to entrism, the entrists may engage in a degree of subterfuge to hide the fact that they are an organisation in their own right.

The time between 2011-2012 was horrendous, so our team have actually improved hugely but we as fans have to remember teams like Arsenal, United, City and Chelsea will spend way more than us so we have to be smart and have a plan. 

In 2012 we had players like Reina (who had his worst season ever), Danny Wilson, Spearing, Adam, Downing, Joe Cole, Assaidi, Caroll, Borini etc. Okey we still got a bunch of bad players, but they are gone by this sommer, the only exception might be Balotelli (who i actually think could be good) and Borini who does not want to leave. 

Brad Jones, Glen Johnson, Lambert, Borini and Gerrard will be gone this summer most likely. That does not really leave loads of players who are bad, yes we need world class signings for sure but we are not going to get them as we can't pay City salaries. But if we can build a foundation of a fantastic midfield, good attack and defence then we got a chance of in the future of being one of the best again. 

We already got players like: Ibe, Emre Can, Sakho, Moreno, Flanagan, Henderson, Allen, Coutinho, Lallana, Sturridge, Markovic even maybe Sterling who will be here for the next 3 seasons. If we can build on that with a decent RB, give Mignolet some competition, defensive midfielder who can fight with Lucas for the DM job and a striker. 

What annoys me is that we are so close of being a top team, but at the same time so dam far away.

I abhor all religion. I can't wait until the last religious person finally concedes the irrationality of their position (should such a thing ever happen). But you can't make sweeping generalisations about what you presume that other people do or should believe. A religion is like a tapestry, woven from the beliefs of thousands or millions, thicker in some places, thinner in others, taking on a certain colour over here, and a different colour over there. It deals with people's deepest existential hopes and fears, and varies so much between individuals that coherency usually boils down to just a couple of core doctrines. People might take moral guidance from a belief system, but inversely a person's comprehension of a belief system can be shaped by their morals and experiences. Christianity is still barbaric, but in most countries with a lot of Christian believers, the socio-economic conditions are such that people have outgrown the barbarism of their doctrine. The same can happen to anyone, in any part of the world, in any religion.

I thought in the Europa League, he was way too cautious in his approach. But, if he were to hypothetically get the job, I'd have confidence in him to do well but he will need time. Time that maybe Liverpool don't have. Maybe he has what it takes to take the club over the hump. Who knows? That being said, ASSE were pulverized against PSG all season long this year. When you think about it, no shame in that. Then again, what can you do with a backline of Theopold-Catherine, Baysee, and Sall. Perrin can't do it alone.

Unfortunately, I don't think he'll be at St. Etienne much longer unless they make the Champions League. Other clubs are definitely looking at him. I think he might need manage another team to show what he's got before he comes to a team like Liverpool, much like Rudi Garcia has done at Roma. Super nice man when you meet him and has all the time for the supporters.

I regularly go to Manchester as I have quite a few friends there and it's surprising how often I will get ""You're alright for a scouser"" or something like that, though it does normally follow asking me to say chicken etc. But this is mainly due to the fact that I will take the mick out of them back and it is a joke.

It seems to be more of a southern thing to still hold a bad view on us though as I visited Egypt and a waiter sat me at a table which seemed free, so no drinks glasses, cutlery as it should be and no coats or bags etc. While my girlfriend went and got food from the buffet a man from London came over and said I was in his seat and so I explained the situation. As soon as he heard my accent he called a waiter over and explained how ""this thieving scouser thought he could rob my seat because I'm a southerner"", and so naturally I saw red. I quite bluntly told him that's not how it is and that I didn't appreciate what he was implying (only maybe not as nice as that) to which his response was that he was ""pulling my leg"". Needless to say I went off on a rant about how I get fed up of being stereotyped by people, especially when most of the people who do so have never even been to Liverpool or met a scouser and base all of their opinions off of stupid old ideas or TV shows which portrayed us as a joke.

I ended up going on about how I actually have lots of pride in saying I'm a scouser and that if he would have spoken to me like a normal human being and then tried to make a joke I would have laughed, but to be out right rude and nasty about it was something I didn't appreciate, told him he could have his table as I'd rather not be anywhere near him and went on my way to a different table. 

The look of shock and embarrassment on his face was priceless for me and the simple fact that every time I walked past him for the rest of the holiday he put his head down made it all worth it.

Sorry for the rant there but that one instance is the one that sticks out to me and does make me rant quite a bit.

Tl;dr - Got put on the wrong table, got called a thieving scouser, went off on a rant, moved table, other guy ended up embarrassed and hanging his head every time I saw him.

null,false,Rosti_LFC,lfc93,,null,"Arsenal have been running that policy for years because they can't afford to spend big. Eventually you can get enough of a bankroll to splash out for a summer, but if Arsenal spent £40m on the likes of Ozil each year indefinitely they'd be down to buying one player each summer and very quickly would end up with a (most ageing) star first XI with no depth on the bench.

Man Utd? They can afford it. They make £360m a year, we make £200m. If we go head to head purely trying to spend against that, we don't win. We get outbid for every star player, we can't offer the wages we can. Same for Chelsea, same for pre-FFP Man City who are now starting to get caught out by the fact they can't stick to their transfer strategy any more. Man City are completely fucked for the next two or three years in how they're going to replace all their ageing star players without spending more than FFP allows them to.

Last season our total net spend on transfers was £20m, and that saw us barely make a profit. We can spend at most £40-50m a season net on players before we start running foul of FFP, which would tie in with the £38m net loss from transfers in the last 12 months. How many star players does that buy you if you're only going on established talent? One Alexis Sanchez or Diego Costa? Man Utd have a net spend of £100m in the last 12 months - not an issue for them, but way more than we can afford. 

And Arsenal are in a position where they can buy just one big star signing a summer because they'd already built a proper squad after years of sensible break-even youth spending and waiting for things to mature. We didn't have a proper squad.

We could have replaced Suarez with star talent, and we'd have run into the exact same problems that probably ultimately undid us last season - no contingency whatsoever for players being suspended or injured. And being in Europe would have only made things worse. We had to bring in a shitload of players because the squad needed at least five or six extra players who could hold a place the first team, and in that scenario there's no way we can afford five or six players at £30m each, even with Suarez money. 

This season we have players on the bench who can actually turn up and change how we play a bit, or at the very least are a tad better than ""fuck it, lets just chuck Moses on and see how that goes"". We have the sort of side that can actually sustain playing in Europe, two lengthy cup runs, and the demands of the league, even if our quality isn't seemingly enough to be in the top four. Which means that *this* summer we don't need to spend on youth again, because the full squad is already there, and we *can* afford to just spend £30-40m on one marquee signing who might make the difference when we need him to.

He came on as a sub v Spurs and scored a tap in. He wasn't playing great that game. He deserves credit because a tap in is still a goal. And it was a great moment in the season for him. 

Against Palace he made a positive impact but he wasn't amazing. He made a positive impact v Villa to. It rarely leads to anything though. He didn't get an assist v Palace although he played a part in the goal. He took a free kick the keeper palmed the ball away and Lallana ran onto it.
Against Besiktas he did next to nothing. We got a penalty he scored even though he wasn't supposed to take it. He deserves credit though for having confidence in himself to take it. But it wasn't a great performance by him he scored a penalty that was it. 

Also yes the linesman made the wrong call but the Villa defenders and Given stopped playing. So you can't say it was a wrongly disallowed goal but a wrongly disallowed chance. 

Balotelli has had enough chances and he hasn't made the most of them. With Sturridge being injured, Balotelli had the oportunity to stand up and show what he can do but he failed to do so. Against Basel he didn't even try. He didn't touch the ball in their box once. That is disgraceful. I'm sure he wants to do well but he hasn't been good enough. Plus the amount of times he has been injured or ill, may not be his fault but it is difficult for him to get many chances. 

Let's face it if it was Borini or Aspas in Balotelli's place it would be completely different. It is only because he is a big name he is being defended. Look at Lambert he has been underused but no one complains about him beibg underused despite the fact he has proven he can score in the league.Balotelli has been given chances and not done anything. Remember this is a man who tried to sue his club when he was at City. Imagine if he dared to do that to Liverpool.

Townsend goes invisible sometimes, but I'd prefer that over active negativity. He takes on his man and does much better at that than Lamela as of late. It's extremely possible that Pamela's 15/4 season at Roma was just another flash in the pan season. They happen all the time, all over the world. It's clear he has talent, but it's also clear that Ade does. And Balotelli does. And Torres and Soldado as well. I just don't really see or understand the faith he gets. It's more blind hope than anything in my opinion. 

Obviously I'd like lamela to come good but I'm not holding my breath. People keep saying these are the games he should be starting, but his play almost makes me flip the channel it's so painful to watch. He's careless, lackadaisical, barks at others when he does things wrong, he's slow, and he doesn't have much drive. I'd prefer to see a player like Townsend who will run his tail off for a bad long ball and still through a thumbs up the direction of the sender than someone who plays a poor pass himself and holds his arms up as if it wasn't his fault.

We could use 2  fullbacks or risk the chance of having none available through injury on at least 1 side of the pitch. Also Moreno/Manquillo are too inexperienced and won't hold up a defence worthy of top 4. We also need at least 1 center midfielder to replace Gerrard, 2 if Can isn't going to move up to cover the injury prone Lucas. We need at least 1 striker on the level of Sturridge or better because Danny is too injury prone to rely on. Why are we in this situation? Because we spent poorly last summer, and the summer before. So no, we can't just go out and sign one world beater, we need more depth for the umpteenth fucking time because we're inept at signing decent depth players.

Yes fair play Arsenal were a bit cash strapped for years but that's not the point, the point is as soon as they had that kind of money they spent it on quality. We've had more money to spend in the last 3 years than they have, yet we continue to squander it on overpriced players. Arsenal supplemented their young squad with world beaters, we signed some injury prone old man, a guy with a notoriously poor attitude and the lesser half of Southamptons back 2. For the price of all 3 we could have had 1 world class player or 2 up and coming world class players. Instead we're probably gonna sign replacements for all 3 in the next 2 seasons. Money well spent. 

The idea our bench turns up and plays is flat WRONG. It's honestly hard not to break down into laughter when our bench is announced. Our biggest weakness is the fact we can't change the flow of a game once it's started.

I never said go and outspend United and Chelsea etc. I just said we have the money to buy multiple stars every season but we don't, we sign tonnes of fluff players instead on exorbitant wages and prices.

The FT City Network is an invitation-only panel of more than 60 leaders from London’s finance and business community. Each month the network debates a topical subject.

There is clear appetite for reform of the UK’s “non-domicile” tax system among some of the City of London’s elite, giving heart to Ed Miliband’s plan to scrap the 200-year-old regime.
Despite widespread scepticism in the City about some of the policies of a prospective Labour government, prominent contributors to the Financial Times’s latest City Network debate suggest the non-dom rules should be changed and loopholes closed in line with the Labour policy initiative.



Alison Carnwath, chairman of Land Securities, thinks the rules are “out of date and should be scrapped”, and explicitly backs Mr Miliband’s plan.


“The non-dom issue invites criticism and ignites public anger,” writes Sir Roger Carr, chairman of BAE Systems. “It is seen as a relic of the past which unfairly favours the few at the expense of the many.”


Katherine Garrett-Cox, who heads investment firm Alliance Trust, says: “The rules around non-doms are confusing and clarification would be beneficial for everyone.”





Labour’s plan to abolish non-dom status was portrayed by the Conservatives as another reason for the business world to distrust Mr Miliband. The Labour leader has few fans in the City of London, having pledged to reintroduce a bankers’ bonus tax alongside a new “mansion tax” on expensive property.
Many in the City are nonetheless torn in their traditional loyalty to the Conservatives, because of the Tory pledge for a referendum on EU membership. The vast majority of the financial services industry, and large swathes of big business, are convinced that exiting the EU would undermine the British economy.


Mr Miliband’s non-dom initiative had been targeted at core Labour voters, angered by uneven tax treatment and the growing gap between Britain’s rich and poor. But the sympathetic reception it has received among some City bigwigs is likely to come as a pleasant surprise to Labour policy makers.
Lord (Mervyn) Davies, the banker turned private equity executive who served as trade minister in the last Labour government, told the debate: “London… should not be a centre for people who do not want to pay their fair share of taxes. That’s why revolutions happen.”



With less than a month to go until the UK general election, the concept of non-doms has been put into question. In the FT’s third instalment of its City Network forum, participants address the question: how important are non-doms to the prosperity of the City?  


Even among City traders, anecdotal evidence suggests that there may be few tears shed over scrapping the regime. One banker recounted in an online comment on a recent FT story how he had worked alongside a colleague who had been born overseas. “This guy paid only a fraction of the tax we all did,” the post reads. “There wasn’t one person in the team who didn’t resent having to ‘cover’ for his lost taxes. And that is a trading floor of an investment bank! This measure will have widespread support.”


Non-doms themselves are mostly hostile to the planned changes. Some of the non-dom members of the FT City Network declined to participate in the debate, for fear of appearing self-serving, but in private some of them expressed enthusiasm for reform. One described the rules as “anomalous” in treating the foreign investments of non-doms differently from foreign investments by “normal” British nationals.


There was not universal support for changes to the non-dom regime in the debate. Several contributors argued that London’s receptiveness as a global financial centre could be put at risk.


Non-dom status allows foreign nationals and even some British nationals to reside in the UK but cite another country as their real domicile, avoiding full UK tax on their overseas earnings in the process.

Yeah, this is the big thing for me.

He's been in management for a longer time than people seem to credit him for and actually there's nothing aside from those three seasons at Dortmund that stands out as particularly amazing, and he's failed to maintain that success this season.

Yes, he was supposed to take it. BR admitted this in the after the game.

You mean the beginning of the season when everyone was in poor form and Balo had just joined the team? You expect a player to just waltz in and adapt to a new team from day one?

Basel was in the beginning of December, again everyone was in poor form. Maybe he deserves criticism for it be he is not to be blamed for the teams poor effort. 

Borini isn't good enough and Aspas is on loan. 

&gt;it is only because he is a big name he is defended.

No, he has faced constant criticism from both fans and the media for anything he does. He was also the scapegoat because BR didn't want to admit he was to blame for the poor form they were in and because Balo is known for his ""Lazy"" effort so who else to blame but him.

Drug reform activists are already well aware of this. For activists 4/20 is not an outreach opportunity - it's mainly a bit of fun where large groups of stoners can get together for a smoke. Yes we'll hand out materials that promote drug reform aswell as different activist groups and charities, but at the end of the day we're well aware that at events like this we're preaching to the choir.

I've never seen an activist smoking a J while discussing drug reform with a member of the public. It is important that we show that drug users are regular folk. Most activist groups make an effort to ensure activists don't look like unwashed hippies or chavs because we're trying to break that stereotype. 

The problem with medical cannabis is a lot of people believe it's a sneaky foot in the door kind of issue that reformers have been banging on about for years. A good issue is about being able to regulate and control drugs if they were legal and how it might be easier for children to buy weed than alcohol. It's also important that we don't make this a discussion about the legalisation of cannabis, and instead the regulation of all drugs. Activists fear that cannabis could be legalised and then the drug reform discussion would be over.

He may have been in poor form leading up to yesterday, but he's been our most creative player this season and thrives in the middle.  Dembele is notorious for letting the ball die at his feet, as you said, and I just don't trust him to be consistent enough to create the way Eriksen does.  Poch even gave Dembele a chance to fill just that role earlier this season.  While he did have some strong showings, he eventually reverted to bad habits.

On top of all that, Chadli has been our third-best attacker outside of Eriksen/Kane most of the season, and to remove him to bring in Dembele, who has mostly been underwhelming this year, would be a shame.  I know that Chadli was in piss-poor form leading up to yesterday's game, but I do hope that goal kicks him back on and he finishes as strong as he was before his father's passing.

To me, I'd like to see Chadli/Eriksen/Lamela in the band behind Kane to finish the season well with Townsend coming in early if Lamela struggles as he did yesterday.  I wouldn't even mind if Yedlin was the main sub for Chadli if Chadli struggles.  With all that pace we have been hearing Yedlin has, I'd love to see how he'd do out on the wings as well.

It can also result in inflexibility and confusion regarding your own position and interest if there is extensive public debate about something that was said during the negotiations. It also means that there's less trust from your negotiating partner if what they say may become public knowledge.

Obviously you can have too much secrecy, but I don't think it's useful or desirable to allow negotiations to be totally transparent because that undermines the negotiation process. What needs to happen here of course is for the US and EU to come to an agreement on TTIP, and have the trade deal scrutinised and amended by their respective democratically elected legislatures. So far I have not seen any evidence that this will not be the case.

I find it a bit frustrating that the people who seem to be making the most noise about TTIP are very vocal activists who don't appear to have much knowledge about how international relations and international trade agreements actually work. They've made a lot of hype and noise about the ISDS clauses in TTIP, despite the fact that ISDS clauses have been fairly standard stuff in international trade agreements for decades. Most European nations will be party to multiple agreements that contain ISDS clauses that have not given us any significant problems. So long as the ISDS clauses are carefully worded and not liable to abuse, then ISDS clauses won't be a problem.

The science also shows the effects that long term use has on the brain - including a reduced IQ and risk of schizophrenia.

Also, at that point, the Big Four was Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea and Man Utd, since City money had not come in. Because of that, we still had consistent CL as a draw in the transfer market. We were a bigger club than we were now in terms of relative prestige and status.

Then Hicks and Gillett happened, as did City with their oil money. We tumbled into mid-table mediocrity whilst City took the top 4 that was previously ours. Our squad was stocked with the likes of Downing, Konchesky, and Charlie Adam. We were at risk of falling into administration, much less contending for top four.

Then John Henry came in and after giving Dalglish a fair run, replaced him with Rodgers. Rodgers did what Dalglish wasn't able to do. Rodgers started to rebuild the squad with real purpose. Under Rodgers, I can actually see LFC making serious progress. 

What has Rodgers achieved in his three seasons here?

1. Improved us from upper-mid-table mediocrity to outside contenders for the top four, with tremendous potential to improve because of how young our players are.
2. Transformed a squad riddled with aging players and dead-weight junk into one that shows tremendous promise with many fantastic young players/ players that haven't reached their prime.
3. Gave us a title shot last season by capitalizing on Suarez's brilliance and gave us top four.

I really don't see many world-class managers could have done much better than what Rodgers did.

we then need to buy a midfield destroyer and another creative center midfielder. coutinho has been great this year, but he needs some help some times, sheeesh. we need another striker who will be more reliable than sturridge. sturridge is a world class striker with world class injury problems and we need to mitigate the risk of him not being in our side. we have missed him SORELY ALL SEASON. his pace and movement is clever and his finishing is lethal. i cannot wait to see a healthy studge again, but i also cannot wait to see us bring in someone a little more reliable. vietto or icardi, to me, would represent perfect options for us...vietto for the bargain rate he's being mooted at and his talent level and icardi because of his talent level. finally, if we are to fully revert back to a 4-3-3 variant, we need another reliable rb. flanno is going through hell and back with injuries and if he's not gonn be healthy for preseason, we need a starter. 

a perfect summer window to me would be 
- st: vietto or icardi 
- cam: firmino, oscar, 
- midfield destroyer: nainngolan or gonalons 
- rb: jaanmat 

im not saying they're realistic, but palyers of that mould i think are what's missing from this current side...plus a real emotional leader. i hope.

My problem with those players we did buy there, is that it did not seem like they where really planned at all. Of course someone like Aspas is never going to get playing time when we had the 2 best strikers in the league and Alberto was for the future, sadly it did not work out for neither. 

Skrtel, Lucas, Henderson, Sterling and Flanno will most likely stay. I at least hope we keep Lucas for another season, so we can get a quality DM and we have someone like Lucas who can come in from the bench. 

When i talk about deadweight are players who are not good enough for Liverpool, not even being a squad player. These are the ones i think we should sell: Borini, Enrique, Aspas, Alberto, Jones, Coates maybe even Balotelli and Lambert.

Just from your chart you can see that between 01 and 09 we were one of the strongest teams in England and consequentially, Europe, considering how well Arsenal, Utd and Chelsea did in that time period particularly between 05 and 10. 
Additionally Liverpool have one of the biggest fan bases in the world apart from Utd and Real Madrid and Barca. 
We were not the power that we were in the late 80s but even now, teams like Barca and Bayern are struggling to establish the dominant consistancy (not in terms of footballing ability) that we had back then. 

We were a global force between 01 and 09, maybe not comparatively but just because we were not the team of the 1980s dosnt mean we wernt a huge european power. 

Also it depends what you mean by 'new fans'. based on the [stat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit#Demographics) that the median reddit user age is 18-29 year old, that would make people who remember Liverpool earlier than 97 or so pretty rare on here so you cant really blame them for talking about how we are not as successful as we were in the mid to late 00s.

The club loses tons of money to the secondary market, usually season ticket holders who never go to a match ripping off tourists, doing double damage to the club: By depriving someone (who has been waiting years to have a season ticket) who wants to go every week of that seat, but also taking the mark-up over face value of that ticket from the club.


The selling-on of tickets for double (or more) face value shows the market will support enormous price increases, and I think that could be balanced with lower cost for season ticket holders who *actually show up*. Absenteeism and predatory scalping from these people should be punished with them losing their seat(s). Let them be filled by real fans, and not serve as a business for anyone other than the club. 


I don't see why we can't solve these issues, other than for a lack of trying.

I think it probably will change, **if** labour form a deal with the SNP. 

The Tories are hampered by the current electoral boundaries. They tried to have them re-adjusted in this parliament but the lib dems famously blocked it when the Tories didn't reform the house of lords. Basically it means even though the tories and labour are both level pegging on about 33%, that will probabyl equate to about 290 labour seats vs 270 tory seats. 

However, I believe the issue is up for rediscussion in 2018 and it will be hard not to address it this time, as to keep the boundaries in their current format for another 5 years will amount of little more than a naked attempt to [gerrymander](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering) the vote... and will be hard for labour to block it given that they will be well short of a majority. 

I think if the Tories kicked out Cameron at the end of this term (which they probably will if they lose) most likely in exchange for either Teresa May or Boris Johnson (no doubt George Osborne would probably try his luck at the leadership contest but I think ultimately would lose). The Tories would then be returning with an arguably more forceful leader against the relatively unpopular Miliband... and if we've learnt anything from the last 100 years of politics in the UK, it's that being incumbent makes you even more unpopular.

The problem is hes a manager and you have to take in the time this change that brings.  A couple of questions arise. 
1) Does he want to come?
2) Is he a significantly better than Rodgers to be worth the effort to change manager?

Will dont know with 1) but with 2) This is where it is tricky. There are no guarantees in football but you could argue that it could be worth the effort. Rodgers biggest issue for me and I have stated this before is that we good we are really good and when we are bad we are very bad. Theres no real middle ground with him. Last years football was the best football I watched, or can remember!, Liverpool playing. This seasons football in spells especially around autumn was worse I can remember watching, worse than even Hodgson. He has a lot to learn but there is things being shown that he can get the team to play. He has had one of the hardest jobs in football in winding down Gerard which should not be taken lightly.  

Klopp has shown over the last number of years, bar this one, that he has the pedigree.  Overachieving nearly every year and winning leagues and trophies. This year has been a disaster for him and many have said if he had that season with us would he still be here as the season is arguably worse than ours.  I would say yes if he brought the level of success he brought Dortmond. 

So this brings us back to the beginning.   If we can get him I think we should try as hes available. However if hes not available we should stick with Rodgers. Some would say its the perfect time to take over this Liverpool team. Our two legends, Gerards and Caraghers, shadow will be away from the team and the club is ready to be molded once again.

null,false,chrisjd,,Green,null,"Well I suppose that does at least allow for the possibility that austerity won't be too bad under Labour. Still I pretty much agree with the last paragraph of this article:

&gt; It gives them an enormous amount of flexibility; it allows them to say well we would be cutting very little, but also that we would be cutting. But it really makes a big difference, there’s a huge difference between £18bn of cuts over the next three years and no cuts. Literally we would not know what we were voting for if we were going to vote for Labour.

There's allowing yourself flexibility and then there's just being unclear. You could vote Labour and get no austerity, or you could vote Labour and get similar levels of austerity to the Tories. It comes down to how much faith you have in Labour to do the right thing for the economy and for the people of this country.

Set BTL as a separate category, with its own targets for new build and share of stock (set regionally/locally) in light of demand for rental/ownership.  Sub-category targets for family homes / flats would also make sense.  Some properties are built as BTL, and should obviously stay as such (e.g. student accommodation), others could just as easily serve either purpose.  Make it free to change use to normal residential, but have an administration charge to convert to BTL.

There's obviously the need for transition, so do so over five or ten years in postcode lottery order, where to gain the initial classification involves a submission statement, the evaluation of this against local needs, and in the event of it being denied a three year window for the landlord to sell up if the application is denied.  Areas where rental supply is in line with market needs see little change, those where abuse is prevalent see landlords lose out, since they'll be forced to sell (or live in) their properties.

That's interesting because it is suggests that there is a replacement that ""we"" (that is, the West) could provide in Libya, and presumably anywhere else, that would ""work"". Where by work, I mean.... well, what, exactly? Give people a good life? If we put a replacement regime in place, are we then responsible for for all the evils it does in the future?

That's relevant because plenty of people have strong views about our own current coalition government and call, for example, some parts of Tory politics ""evil"". So even if we put in place a British style political infrastructure and economy and whatever else, at enormous expense, there's still a good chance we can be accused of doing terrible things. That's before we even consider the reality that the best we can probably impose in terms of regime change isn't going to be anything like a life in Britain.

I'm not sure we *can* get the situation anywhere under control or start issuing replacement governments.

Some other people seem hellbent on telling some people that it wont. Mostly this prediction is coming based on what, I dont know. Some of us are smart enough to realize that no one, absolutely no one can guarantee success. 
But then, we also realize that to try to achieve success, we need to rid ourselves of failure or an element of failure holding us back. Take a chance, win the raffle sort of.

That is absolutely what you are being by thinking and painting this picture in your head that Brendan Rodgers is going to do something special next year. Based on what evidence again, I dont know. Unless another Luis Suarez comes along, that is not happening based on the bullshit we have been fed this year.

Ha, well indeed. Lovely lovely politics, eh?

For me, Labour are doing what you'd expect them to do from a macroeconomic perspective. They're unapologetically Keynesian, and the Keynesian thing to do is ease off the cuts while the economy needs it, and ramp them up when it can take it. Without a crystal ball it is very difficult to make any commitments as to what will be needed in the next 5 years. The Tories are either not being Keynesian at all (likely considering their behaviour in the last parliament) or are making an unabashed (and unfounded) prediction that the economy is back to runaway growth. The SNP (for example) by promising increased spending every year for 5 years are making a similar unfounded prediction that the economy will not have recovered in the slightest in 5 years (or, similarly, have abandoned Keynesianism and are willing to keep increasing spending forever). Labour have given themselves the flexibility to do either, but with a firm indicator (in the form of the Lock) as to what their intended end goal is (a balanced current budget). That seems like the only responsible position to me.

As for the likes of Mandy criticising the mansion tax? Well, he's not the one in charge. Labour is a broad church, and I can only suggest that we be happy that the sane left wing moderates are back at the helm and not the Blairites (and would further suggest we reward that good news with votes).

A lot of fans were upset with Suarez's antics, and so upset that it distorted their judgement. Suddenly, his 'risks' outweighed his playing ability, a judgement only made by liverpool fans. Everyone else knew that Suarez(unlike Balotelli) was so good that he was worth his 'risks'. We let Suarez go, not because his antics was costing us (although they played a part and made the decision much more palatable), but primarily because he wanted to leave.


The same distorted judgement applies with Rodgers. We're frustrated when we see the mistakes he makes, and when things don't go well. We lose perspective and crave for an instant-fix, for some world-class manager/player to suddenly come in and makes things better.

Before this season, a lot of Arsenal fans were calling for 'wengerout', 'time for wenger to go', because it seemed like Arsenal wasn't making any progress when you look at the trophies and the league standings. But of course they were making progress. They were making progress through their new stadium, building a base for the future, whilst holding on to their status as a top 4 club. As a fan, its not the kind of progress you care for, but as a club, this sort of progress is as important and significant as winning silverware. Because of the progress they made wrt to their stadium, they can now finally spend on big players like Ozil and Sanchez, and do so consistently every year. 

I can see a similar sort of progress under Rodgers. In terms of league standings and trophies, we've taken two steps forward one step back but on average, we've improved 2 or 3 places from previous seasons (7+2+5 = 14, 14/3 = 4.7 compared to the previous three seasons before Rodgers where we averaged 7th). But in terms of squad-building, we've made serious improvements. The current squad is outside-contenders for top four, but its so young that we don't have to do any serious rebuilding. A few crucial pieces of the puzzle and we're set for the next five years.

I think if we sacked Rodgers, City would snap him up in an instant. Everyone else except Liverpool fans recognizes this (ala Suarez). Liverpool are making serious progress under Rodgers, and when I frequent other subreddits they all have a grudging respect for Rodger's ability, but many liverpool fans don't see the progress and focus on the mistakes Rodgers has made. When liverpool has a poor game, rival fans (mostly mancs and chelsea) aggressively mock Rodgers because they know how good he can be and want to put him down at every opportunity. The same pattern happens with Wenger and Mourinho. When their teams perform poorly, 'wenger out', 'when was the last time wenger won a trophy', 'mourinho has no plan b, can't break down his own bus'.

On the other hand, when Moyes was at Man Utd, everyone mock-supported him because they wanted him to stay. When City underperforms, people are ambivalent about Pellegrini because he's mediocre and they don't really care whether he stays or leaves.

Ask yourselves; would you rather see Rodgers at Liverpool or at City.

Going by your summary, that doesn't appear to be the case. The article is in no way a representation of general feeling - you may as well say that an EDL pamphlet represents the same.

&gt;she likens the ""tracksuited types"" (are those her words or yours? careful there) to the norovirus and cockroaches.

Yes she does, she's describing an entire group of people as pests. Is she in power? Is she actually directing people to go out and kill the vermin? Does she say anything else that makes taking her words out of context seem a bit self-serving and silly in the manner I just demonstrated using just the first paragraph? Otherwise you're reduced to matching bad words people have said and asserting that they 'must' be the same type of person...you did, of course, go and look up the Oz trial and how they were prosecuted for inciting 'fucking in the streets' by the UK government, right? I mean, you must have, you wouldn't be carrying on with the same mistaken....oh.

&gt;what context are you reffering to?

You mean other than yours? Which part of ""you'll have to include the very next part of the paragraph where she demonstrates her reposte"" didn't make sense?

See, now you're doing the no-context thing again, right after I highlighted with a historical precedent why it's a dumb thing to do. Does repeating the same trick now mean that it's not been highlighted and addressed? Or are you going to pick apart every statement in the piece and pretend it's only allowed to make sense with your approval (as long as context is provided and spelled out for you)? Get some perspective.

&gt;the historical context is clear

So...now you're using historical context to override the context of the article in favour of yours. Does she mention Rwanda anywhere? (It's a place, not a 'the').

&gt; this isn't about being offended

Actually it is - to be precise, your interest in being offended above all else and telling people to fuck off when they don't agree with you. You've actually demonstrated this more than once already, and not just in this thread.

&gt;you're trying to twist this into a debate about political correctness.

Really? Where did I say this was about PC? Not too sure how dealing with your attitude constitutes a debate.

&gt;why are you so keen to defend someone's right to dehumanise asylum seekers?

Where did I say I was doing that? Oh I get it, we're into the you-tell-me-what-I-really-mean part.

&gt;still dont get your point about my account age either

Which makes you the first person in over four years of reddit to not do so.

&gt;you realise i've been on reddit longer than 20 days right?

So why aren't you using one of your other, much older accounts? You don't sound like you've been on reddit very long at all since you're making basic context mistakes and pretending that account age has no significance at all.

But Scotland, there is so little in Scotland, as I said wasting so much money on a line for 5 million people, not even that, more like 3 million, is exactly as I describe, a waste, it will be too expensive to use, to expensive to build, and too slow compared to air travel, what you are most likely expecting is it to be built and then subsided so it is actually even slightly commercially viable, well how about England doesn't subsidise Scotland while getting screwed over itself.

I don't even live in London, as far as I am concerned it is a problem that is the way, you can't get anywhere without going through London, that is a problem for the infrastructure of London which should be fixed.

You can only really get them for mid- and higher-end brand foundations, ones that have a counter (usually in a department store) with a sales assistant who can help colour match you and then make samples for you. Also if you have a larger Boots with brand counters, like Estee Lauder, Clinique etc., they can also help you. 

You can ask the sales assistant to suggest a foundation to you or, if you have researched one already, ask to be colour matched. It may take some trial and error finding the right shade, and the lighting inside shops is always pretty terrible, so you need to check the shade in daylight to make sure it is a good match. You basically want to make sure that the foundation colour matches your face AND neck, so it doesn't look like you are wearing a mask when you wear foundation. (I've linked to a video below by a great professional make up artist about finding the right shade.) When you think you've found a good shade, or it may be two shades that you think match, ask the sales assistant for samples so that you can test how well it wears on your skin throughout the day. The samples are free and I highly recommend getting them over just buying a foundation straight away!

You sure about that though? Harry Redknapp has trophies and finals, but I wouldn't want him in charge of us. There are plenty of managers who have had a couple of freak seasons in an otherwise mediocre managerial career, because sometimes players and stars just align for you. 

Look at Roy Hodgson. Had an amazing stint with Fulham, got them from relegation to a Europa League final, and then was utterly shite for us (and I'll admit an EL final is no CL final, but if Klopp was even half as useless as Hodgson I wouldn't touch him). Look at AVB - was fantastic for a season at Porto and won a treble, and was then rubbish for both Chelsea and Spurs. 

When it's managers like Mourinho, Ancelotti, Van Gaal, even Benitez, it's easy to say it's talent and have confidence in them because lightning doesn't strike twice. So far Klopp's 15 years of management don't really show anything as far as repeated success would go. As someone else said, blindly expecting Klopp to recover from a shit season and repeat his current career peak at Liverpool is no different to blindly expecting Rodgers to get us back into 2nd place next season if he stays. Personally I don't think either would happen. 

&gt; Who has a bulletproof record? You surely dont mean Guardiola for us. 

Out of people who might actually come to us, at least Benitez. Diego Simeone (unlikely) or De Boer would probably also be in there if we're insisting they've at least won something in the last few years. 

&gt; Annnndddd here it is. The degrade other leagues to make us look better argument.

&gt; In one post, you've given all the possible excuses one can for Rodgers. Amazing. 

Yeah sure, except I'm not giving excuses for Rodgers at all - I've barely even mentioned him. I'm saying that I think Klopp is pretty overrated considering how little he's actually achieved in his 15 year career compared to more established prospects (I'll go with Benitez again), and how utterly shit Borussia Dortmund have become this season. And I'm not arguing that Rodgers should definitely stay, I'm saying I don't see how Klopp is an obvious step up. I don't get how people can argue that Rodgers should be sacked because he took us from 2nd to 5th, and then insist we replace him with a manager who has just taken a club from 2nd to 9th.

If you don't have that capital built up already, the dividend you will receive becomes so small as to be of very questionable value. The £20,000 you mention might pay you £1,000 a year in dividends - 5% is a decent yield.

For someone under 50, an investment geared more towards capital growth is likely to be more appropriate.

I wonder whether Labour will actually change their mind on boundaries or some other kind of more substantial electoral reform now that all their Scottish votes are pretty much wasted!

With Cameron out, Johnson may be the unknown factor, and may do well as a less extreme Farage. I think the Tories may be fucked if they choose Osbourne!

As for lasting that long - with the new fixed 5 year terms, one they past their confidence vote they can't actually call a new election unless there is a no confidence fore or a vote to call an early election by 2/3 of MPs. If SNP pass the confidence vote I can't see them going back on it as they are desperate to come across as non-disruptive.

&gt; According to a secret memo signed by Hillary Clinton, released by Wikileaks, Qatar has the worst record of counter-terrorism cooperation with the US. And yet, where are the western demands for Qatar to stop funding international terrorism or being complicit in the rise of jihadi groups? Instead, Britain arms Qatar&amp;#039;s dictatorship, selling it millions of pounds worth of weaponry including &amp;quot;Crowd-control ammunition&amp;quot; and missile parts.

&gt; Chatham House professor Paul Stevens says: &amp;quot;For a long time, there was an unwritten agreement whereby al-Qaida&amp;#039;s presence was tolerated in Saudi Arabia, but don&amp;#039;t piss inside the tent, piss outside.&amp;quot; Coates Ulrichsen warns that Saudi policy on Syria could be &amp;quot;Afghanistan on steroids&amp;quot;, as elements of the regime have turned a blind eye to where funding for anti-Assad rebels ends up.

&gt; According to Clinton&amp;#039;s leaked memo, Saudi donors constituted &amp;quot;The most significant source of funding to Sunni terrorist groups worldwide&amp;quot;.

null,false,DaiWales,null,null,null,"Hey, people won't care for my story but maybe you will.

The first team I played in was through simply adding players from the UK. Any UK players we found we would invite to a guild. Eventually there was like 200 players in the guild and we simply formed a team based on who was in the guild. Dota was growing in the UK at the time and wasn't quite where it is today. This is going back about 18 months.

The team folded before TI4 but we never did any LANs and never achieved anything outside of stomping the crap teams in the UK jDL divisions. That's not an achievement though.

More recently I decided to set up my own team. This is going back to maybe September or October last year. I simply posted here on Reddit, got plenty of interest, and spent ages trialling players. Some players needed immediate cutting, others were good players but were horrendously toxic, others weren't quite happy with how slowly things were developing (honestly it takes some time to start from scratch). Eventually we settled on a 5-man roster and felt good about how we were doing. We attended LAN but didn't make a splash as a team, only getting 3rd. Our best player (Korben) left. Gator (worst player) was kicked. Monhay wanted to play more casually. So again I had to rebuild. It took me a couple of weeks to get two decent players, which I felt was fortunate. It took another few weeks to find a suitable 5th player for the next LAN. We played much better at this LAN but again couldn't make a splash again. Now we are in a lull where we have to replace another player and look past all the big pro tournaments to the summer UK LANs. This time we have time on our side, but still the going is tough to find the right players. I'm trialling a couple right now but you never know how good players fit in to the team until you practice. Even 'UK dream teams' like Rich Gang can struggle to find consistency.

If I were to offer advice it's that before playing in a team you may think you have something to offer players, but at 3.9k you should not shoulder that responsibility. There are a bunch of 3.5-4.5k UK players out there who have potential but don't have direction. If you're confident in your ability to lead a team then start one and stick with your ideas, but learn and adapt them to your team.

A great person to reply here would be Dreadknight. Obviously it's a different skill level but he would offer good advice for getting the most out of a team, exceeding what they should achieve on paper. His team were seeded 5th for Insomnia but finished 3rd, because their plan was simply better prepared. They are better as a team than as individuals, and when you're a good player to begin with, it's only going to have a positive outcome. If your team are happy with how you are setting out your drafts then stick with it. But if people start getting vocal then it's often best to take the back foot and let the team try to resolve the issues together. The only worry you have then is if your play doesn't hold up and your team decides to kick you and go alone.

Good luck. There are plenty of players out there to team up with you but just be prepared to have ice cream on the agenda rather than a LAN win.",null,0,null,1429543764,null,0,false,0,cqik1m8,null,t3_338n0o,null,t1_cqik1m8,null,t3_338n0o,null,null,null,1432497926,null,-4,false,UKDota,t5_2uyoj,-4,null

null,false,pepe_le_shoe,null,null,null,"Contactless is not secure. Anyone who tells you otherwise is lying. It is insecure by design, nevermind all the security flaws in card readers. 

It is limited to how much can be charged in a single transaction. That is pretty much the only security feature.

The easiest attack is not really even an attack in the technical sense. If you have a card reader, you can just configure it to be very sensitive, and wander round the street bumping into people charging their contactless cards. I've attended conferences where security researchers have claimed to have PoC for this.

A more difficult, but academically well explored attack is a relay attack, where you simultaneously mitm one transaction, and use the data to conduct a fraudulent transaction elsewhere. I'm not convinced this one is practical, and occam's razor leads me to assume that it is possible to simply clone or replay the rfid component of a payment card. It shouldn't be, but it makes more sense than all the other hair-brained theoretical attacks. 

How paypass and paywave work under the hood is proprietary, but I have to guess that they are just regurgitating a static auth code, much like the typical wireless ID cards you find in corporate office environments.

Ideally they would mix in details of the specific transaction, and do a challenge and response with the bank, but the standard for how card readers work wouldn't allow that, because they have to function off-network, so as I said earlier, insecure by design. Convenience trumps security, and banks are happy to eat the cost of insurance for fraud rather than insisting on a secure standard for card payments. 

My recommendation is to keep the majority of your cash in one bank account, for which you NEVER ever use the card, and have another bank account, or credit card with a low limit, that you use for shopping, especially online.

I have most of my money in one bank account, and the card for that account never leaves my house, and never gets used except for 2-factor authentication online. I then have another account with a different bank, into which I put ~£200 at a time, and use that for shopping, and top it up when it gets low. Historically, it was easier to get a fraud refund for a credit card, though in fairness, these days banks are pretty fast about refunding you when it's a debit card.

I've hard cards stolen/cloned/details leaked online enough to stop trusting banks/vendors not to lose that information. Just assume that your primary bank account will get compromised, and act accordingly.

We have done in the past - it probably won us the Champions League in 2005 -  but there's nothing special about us that means we should be routinely higher than 5th. We're recruiting from the same pool of scouts, coaches, managers and players as all the other clubs. Last season was us punching above our weight, this season we're back to normal.

When a nation just emerges from Civil War and a dynasty that had a monopoly over a whole nation reigns for nearly half a century suddenly collapses, a UN-sponsored traditional authority should have been the natural course of action. Instead Libya was essentially left to fend for itself for nearly 3 years, with all signs of underlying instability ignored and yet we are surprised the nation is a mess at present. The divisions present if Libya are the result of internal fractures left to fester and crack further, not something that was inevitable. 

The UN is given too much flak for being ""useless"", yet any historical examples of the UN working as intended are conveniently ignored. One only needs to take lessons from the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia and how it turned around a country plagued by decades of Civil War, conflict with Vietnam and one of the most brutal and ineffectual regimes of the 20th Century. During the aftermath of Gaddafi's fall Libya was actually stable, relatively united but on its knees. The then Libyan government would have had no qualms cooperating with the UN if it meant real and meaningful assistance was provided. 

Problem is that there was no clamour for helping Libya out, even from the continent that had the most to gain from stability and the most to lose from instability. Forking out taxpayer money towards a foreign country was, and still remains, a *courageous* political policy. So doing nothing was deemed as the best course of action. 

Four years on and it turns out that *Laissez-faire* foreign policy is as disastrous as reckless foreign policy.  

Which is why I am not very optimistic that the migration issue will be resolved any time soon. Even if European as a whole manages to set-up a framework that isolates the continent from migration flows, I suspect that it will only leave the continent more willing to consider reckless action when the consequence of the displacement of people becomes once again remote. And within a decade or so we are back to step one, finding ways to isolate ourselves once again from the fallout of past foreign policy blunders.

And that is pretty much irrelevant as it will be 3x the price, just like it is 3x the price to use the current rail infrastructure now, rail infrastructure that is all ready built and not massively over budget (because it always will be)

&gt; You're talking about millions of extra passengers a year on the rail line, assuming even no induced demand and ignoring the population growth at the two ends of the line. 

Millions eh, you realise 977,000 travel into London each day, millions is nothing, millions is a weeks worth of travel, not a reason to spend billions connecting up only 5 million people, 5 million people which is the whole of Scotland by the way, if you take the central belt it is only 3.5 million people, The population of Manchester alone is 2.5 million, then you have Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, Stoke-on-Trent, and whatever other major cities it is going to. The population of North West England alone is 7 million people, twice the population you are going to connect in Scotland, who is more important 7 million or 3.5 million, the answer is obvious especially when you take that their are actually more major cities being connected on the way, it is quite frankly a no brainer. Even more so when you take the fact that flying is going to be cheaper, not slightly cheaper it is going to £50 vs £150, if not actually way more, London to Paris is 225miles, London to Edinburgh 340, London to Glasgow around 400, it cost around £60 to go from London to Paris, it cost around £60 to go from London to Glasgow now, on the infrastructure already built. London to Le Mans, a total distance of 328 miles, is £165, which is about as much as I had expected, 3x the going rate of air travel which costs £50-60.

It wouldn't be competitive at all and would therefore be a waste of money while saving very little time all with massive expense in the building of it in the first place.

As horrible as it is, these people need to know that coming to Europe is not an option, it would just cause more problems. I realise that this is a very moral and politically gray area and people will cite the Gadaffi crisis and even the exploitation of colonising nations in the previous few centuries but at a certain point, that just becomes so far removed from our current times that I personally don't feel it can continue be used as a reason to justify allowing these people in.

Spoiling your ballot is not a good alternative to not-voting precisely *because* it gets ""counted""...It contributes to the turnout figures, which lends FPTP credibility and allows proponents to say ""hey, FPTP is clearly working, why change it?""

Additionally, when was the last time you heard politicians address ballot spoilerers, or go after the ""spoilt vote""? No, what we hear about are people who are ""turned off politics"" or ""disengaged"". Non-voters have *far* more sway with politicians than those who spoil their ballots.

In terms of voting reform, the two biggest contributers to change are non-voters and hung parliaments, so yes, if you're in a contested seat then vote and vote for whoever is likely to cause a hung parliament, but in safe seats? Well, we'll get to that later.

2: I would, but I feel helping perpetuate FPTP will do more harm in the long-run than supporting any one party.

3: Voting isn't good in and of itself, voting is the delivery mechanism for due representation and unfortunately FPTP doesn't provide that, especially in safe seats. We don't vote so our favourite party can recoup deposits. We don't vote so that the big two parties might swing slightly to the left or right in the next election. We vote to be represented and if voting won't provide that, then helping prop up FPTP by voting will do more harm in the long-term than giving your favourite party a slightly louder voice in the next 5 years.

4: I said this in another thread yesterday, but the reason politicians don't care about the issues of 18-24 year olds isn't because they have a 45% turnout, it's because there's so few of them. The total number of 18-24 year olds is *tiny* compared to the total number of over-65s, which means even if you somehow managed to get 80% of 18-24 year olds to vote (and you won't, for many reasons), then their vote would equate to less than a 1% increase in votes for any one party. They simply don't have the numbers to be worth targeting for politicians. Again, this is a problem created by FPTP. Under a proportional system young voters would be represented proportionally (albeit still quite small), but under FPTP their representation is so low as to have zero value to politicians fighting for votes.",null,1,null,1429545181,null,0,1429545499,0,cqikwcy,null,t3_337mc9,null,t1_cqikwcy,null,t1_cqicw19,null,null,null,1432498399,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

We also lost our second best player and probably the best striker in the premier league for practically the whole season due to injuries.

We brought in a lot of players who have taken time to adapt. Yet we still had a run of form after christmas that was better than any other team in the league. And it was a substantial run. 2 losses in 20 games since christmas. That is championship winning form. 

It started too late this season, but next season we will hopefully have a fit striker for the whole season. Our young players will be a year older and will be more settled. With the right signings in a couple of key areas I don't see why we wouldn't be title contenders next season.

The pessimism on this forum after losing one game is unbelievable. BR made mistakes in the lineup. Gerrard shouldn't have played, the system was wrong. I get it.

Unfortunately I don't think there is any best advice in that situation. As ever, I'd advise people to buy a membership, but most can't see the value in it unless they're going to buy tickets.

There's nothing to stop people getting tickets from touts; after all it's been going on for years and isn't likely to stop soon. They just need to be aware that they have no recourse if things do go wrong.

Increasingly I'm seeing people only offering spares to people they know or can be recommended. That's because they value their memberships so much. I've passed a ticket on to people in the past and they ended up in the hands of a tout, so I lost my membership for two full seasons. 

_Edit: as an aside, overseas people just don't understand how big a problem touting is. When you've struggled to get a ticket for a game and you're then accosted by half a dozen touts in your way into the ground, it's pretty frustrating. The club needs to, and is, working on ways to stop people buying memberships in bulk, as that's where some of those tickets come from._",null,0,null,1429545858,null,0,false,0,cqilb4i,null,t3_337ibr,null,t1_cqilb4i,null,t1_cqikstc,null,null,null,1432498593,null,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2,null

null,false,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,null,"&gt; her suggestion during the Scottish debates

Those debates predate the manifesto, and predate the quote I gave. That said, her quote [at the time](http://www.davidhumeinstitute.com/sturgeon-wants-rule-second-referendum-not-yet/) was:

&gt; ""A vote for the SNP in this election is not a vote for a referendum. It’s a vote to have Scotland’s voice heard in Westminster. I do accept the result of the referendum.
&gt;
&gt;There is a triple lock on this. Before it is inserted in the manifesto, public opinion has to change, and then people have to vote for the manifesto if it is in it. Then people have to vote for independence.""

It seems a bit nonsensical to ask the SNP to demand that they rule out one of their core beliefs out of principle, when clearly there's a very high barrier to actually having a referendum.

Indeed if you look at [today's manifesto](http://votesnp.com/docs/manifesto.pdf) there is absolutely no mention of a referendum and the sole reference to independence is:

&gt; The SNP will always support independence - but that is not what this election is about.

If your complaint is that they won't rule out a referendum in their 2016 Holyrood manifesto then I think that's answered adequately by her ""triple lock"".

If your complaint is that they won't rule out a referendum in their 2020 manifesto, or 2024, or 2028, or if the UK decides to exit the EU then I think you're into the realm of paranoia.

It's entirely up to them to decide when to put that into their manifesto. If they decide it ""too early"" then they'll be punished at the ballot box, if they decide it when public support's behind it then they won't.

At some point I think it's inevitable there will be another referendum. It might be this decade, it might be next, it might be in 50 years.

null,false,Rukooo,lfc99,,null,"&gt; Fantastic. Where were you with this post last year? Where were you with this post in 2005? Where was this post of yours in 2007 in the final? Where was this post when we won the treble? Where was this bullshit post when we were wetting Europe's pants and beating Barcelona, Real Madrid, Juventus, Ac Milan, Inter Milan, Chelsea, Arsenal and all comers in Europe?

I posted this now, because this global force thing kept popping up in every thread and I wanted to address it. 

&gt; Thank you. Let's sink into mediocrity and not even try to right things. What are you even on about mate? I am stunned. I am stunned at the level that some fans here want to fall to just to justify this farce of a manager and his messed up results time and time again.

Get a fucking grip mate. It's just a simple look at where we've been and where we are now. You've jumped to rest of the conclusions, well done. All our managers in the past 24 years have been ""messing up results time and time again"", more so than Rodgers. None of them won the title. Only Rodgers and Benitez have come even REMOTELY close.

&gt; Currently it is. How much ever you try to deflect this blame away from Brendan Rodgers, currently there is no one else who is more responsible than the manager himself.

Never did I say that us losing is NOT Rodger's fault. Again, you jumped to your own conclusions and are assuming that's what I'm trying to say. I'm simply saying Rodgers is no different from our previous managers in that 24 year stint. They've lost a lot of games for us and made mistakes as well. I'm saying let's not pretend Rodgers is only manager to have hard losses and mistakes!

&gt; Really? You really do no remember the European force we were last decade? Or are you just clinging onto anything and everything to defend and justify Rodgers?

Of course Rafa's time in Europe was amazing. We had really good 3 seasons of Champions League under him. But what's that compared to 24 years of nothing in Europe? If you want to grasp at winning the UEFA cup in 2000 as a major achievement go ahead. But the way I see it, we only had 3 good years in Europe in the 24 years. 

Just face it. We have not been a global force in the 24 years. Teams such as United, Barca, Madrid, Bayern have been worlds ahead of us. We have been NOWHERE near that quality and consistency. Only briefly with Rafa were we as good as them and thats a small slice of the whole pie.

I had sent in the application to register to vote via the Government website on the 2nd of April, and they sent an email saying they had sent it to my council, who would contact me to confirm I was registered or to ask for more info.

I thought that was the end of it until I saw [NerdCubed's video about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nchXrMlHRD0), whereupon I realised that *I haven't been contacted*. I don't think I'm registered.

I contacted my local electoral registration office using the number in the email, but their office is closed now. Does anybody know what I should do?

[edit 5:37pm: Heading out to the local library, which is still open until 7:30pm, to see if they have any ideas. Still looking out for replies here, too.]

And yet we were running European forces scared in the last 10 years itself.

&gt; It's just a simple look at where we've been and where we are now. You've jumped to rest of the conclusions, well done. All our managers in the past 24 years have been ""messing up results time and time again"", more so than Rodgers. None of them won the title. Only Rodgers and Benitez have come even REMOTELY close.

Benitez won stuff. Rodgers has been talking stuff. Benitez delivered when it mattered. Rodgers fluffs when it matters. Benitez has won things wherever he's gone, Rodgers........................................

&gt; I'm saying let's not pretend Rodgers is only manager to have hard losses and mistakes!

What exactly is the point of bringing other managers into this? Brendan Rodgers is the current manager. The one great season, and the rest of the clusterfuck is solely down to him. And I'm not even debating that other managers dont make mistakes. BUT that isnt my concern. My concern is this conman at the helm currently wwho just talks, talks and talks shit and delivers fuck all.  

&gt; Teams such as United, Barca, Madrid, Bayern have been worlds ahead of us. 

No Shit!!!! Really? Not even comparing us to them. It's internal. We have done fuck all to even remain in the position we managed under Rafa and gone backwards. 

&gt; But the way I see it,

That entire period was us being a force, however you want to paint this to suit the Rodgerian agenda. A European force which top teams wanted to avoid, and a force that tore apart way stronger opposition regularly as compared to bending over and spreading wide for Aston Villa.

&gt;**Don’t try to recruit actual members. The age of mass membership of political parties is dead.**

Have the SNP tried to recruit members or was it just that the 45% of the population that wanted independence realised it was worth voting with their feet? Certainly if they were having a membership drive, it wasn't really working before September 19th. And there's the converse: Have the other parties *stopped* trying to recruit members? Again, I don't think so. Labour certainly keep trying new schemes to get more people involved and our membership has been growing.

&gt;**Don’t bother with genuine rallies and meetings – town-hall politics belongs in the last century**

I'm pleased to see this 'rule' being broken and Sturgeon clearly does break it. No problems there, then, except the minor quibble that I'd argue other people have broken it recently, too, notably Jim Murphy during the referendum campaign, and Ed Miliband over the last few years (but not lately, sadly).

**Treat grassroot party members as you would embarrassing relatives: they are the old guard, nutjobs, a liability.**

This is basically Blair's fault, and is, sadly, true.

**Run a ruthlessly narrow campaign: technology allows you to ignore most voters**

Okay, this one's just weird. The SNP have other policies, but are basically a single-issue party that pads their single issue with other policies that make them look good. Furthermore, Alex Salmond is indisputably a master of 'triangulation', as employed by Blair, and so the SNP is no less reliant on focus groups and the rest than any other party. That's why they've relentlessly argued for no tuition fees -- plays well with focus groups! -- even though a lower proportion of working class Scots go to uni than working class people from the rest of the country, because they've failed to implement the kinds of grants that the tuition fees we have in England and Wales pay for. And this brings me back to my original point: Because the SNP ultimately have a narrow focus, they can and do blame any problems that result from their policies on the single issue that is their *raison d'etre*. In the case of class-based university disparities, that kind of stagnant social mobility is *clearly the fault of the English who are all Tories*. Obviously I'm not saying that we don't have a problem with social mobility in the UK, just that blaming it on the English is not a good argument.

**Bring out the bludgeon: negative campaigning wins elections.**

We pushed as hard as we could to win a game that we didn't need to win, when we could have just sat back a bit more and let it most likely be an incredibly dull 0-0. I'd say that's being tactically naïve, and I wouldn't expect Benitez to have done the same in a game like that. 

And you're right, but I feel very few teams ever go a full season without the occasional slip-up against smaller teams. The fact that we were so far behind in Decembers is probably the main reason we've lost 4th, but losing both games to United definitely hasn't helped either. 

Was just expressing the sentiment that I feel Rodgers is typically better at us sweeping smaller teams aside, but doesn't seem to be able to set us up in a way that will grind out results when we need one (like, under Rodgers we almost always seem to play for a win, even in games where a draw would be decent enough).
