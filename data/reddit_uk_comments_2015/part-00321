However, I do think it would have changed the Stoke result, because as soon as we lost Kane, their defence stopped having to work. Kane was pulling them all over the shop, creating openings for the midfield. It meant ball retention was slightly higher, and we were looking up and where to go. As soon as he went off, we went into panic mode, and that's where it all went wrong. It was part psychological and part tactical, as it free'd their players up more to play an attacking game which brought about the draw.

The Everton defender John Stones, is still the priority of the English club. The Guardian today spoke of a new offer to come to € 56 million. The Blues have interfered in the Pedro folder. Better, Barça winger has agreed to Chelsea announced Marca. There is talk of an amount of € 28 million fixed € 2 million bonus.

&gt; Londoners are double blow as they recover in passing a player courted by both Manchester. A finish that will not make everyone happy. In fact, his arrival could cause one or more departures. If an item like Juan Cuadrado could be sacrificed, Willian also could go. Reportedly, the Brazilian is not resistant to the idea of ​​a new challenge. A challenge that could bring the side of Bavaria. Willian has indeed been proposed to Bayern Munich in recent days. But that's not all.

&gt; The Brazilian has also been offered to Paris Saint-Germain. A rather interesting idea on paper when departures last minute. Especially as the Chelsea player could join the already large colony Auriverde PSG. But this track has very little chance of success since Willian has Brazilian nationality.

What I mean by that is that we would be forced into bringing in a marquee signing and build the team around whoever that may be, even if it means effecting Pelle/Rodriguez/Long etc.

Whether thats a good or bad thing, or whether or not its necessary, Im not sure. I just think that will be the fallout.

In the first goal he has no idea where his back 4 is and dives in recklessly. We concede.

Do I even need to say anything about the second goal we concede? And this was a game where everyone was boasting about his performence. That was a troubling sign for this sub and their irrational obsession for Sakho. 

[Example 2](http://www.soccer-blogger.com/2014/12/21/gotr-liverpool-vs-arsenal-2014-highlights-2-2-coutinho-debuchy-giroud-skrtel-goals-video/) Arsenal's second goal. That's very good positioning. Loses Giroud twice in span of 7 seconds. 

[Example 3](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2duagz_all-goals-liverpool-2-2-leicester-01-01-2015_sport) Leicester's first goal. Now this one is harsh, but then again if Sakho's positioning was superb he would have stayed with his man.


[Example 4](http://www.soccerhighlightstoday.com/2015/02/video-liverpool-3-2-tottenham-hotspur.html) Spurs first goal. He gets drawn in by Lamela who is picked up by 3 other players and in doing so, he loses Kane. This one isn't even that hard to execute. Kane is right in front of him.

Putting aside the year I went to Canada, summer was spent doing gigs, rehearsals, musicals, arranging music, doing transcriptions, whatever I could be paid for. 

I couldn't have afforded an unpaid internship. Not even two or four weeks. I have been living through the grace and mercy of my ability to fill my timetable with work for a reasonably long while. Which isn't really grace or mercy, just an ability to find the right places to look. 

I'm not particularly struggling as a musician. I'll earn about twenty five grand this tax year and probably 30-40 next. It isn't huge but for a graduate wage it's respectable and I love what I do so no complaints. If my agency takes off I'll earn more but that's long term plans. 

I would recommend to other musicians that they do start working immediately. When they start university, they should start finding professional work. Trade on the credibility that is offered by having a university degree. Waiting till after you finish your degree or equivalent means you start looking for jobs and discover everyone wants experience, publicity material and the ability to convincingly bullshit your way through the week. Which leaves a lot of people floundering. 

And for the floundering souls?

I turned up for my signing appointment 10 minutes early and was waiting in the seating area. 15 minutes had passed and nobody had called me, so I told the floor manager.

He asked me to sit back down to wait, and when he returned he told me that I had missed my advisor calling my name. I obviously protested and was told that I would be seen in 30 minutes so I waited again. Cue my advisor calling me over, told me that because I had missed my appointment I will be written up and will possibly get sanctioned. Protested and broke down in tears. She showed no remorse.

This was the second time I was called out on their mistakes and had  a 13 week sanction. This is what I did to try and get something to live off of:

* Pleaded and cried to the advisor/floor manager
* Sent them my reasons why I shouldn't be sanctioned
* Applied for hardship payments
* Applied for a reconsideration of the sanction
* Got denied for hardship payments, so I appealed against that
* Went to my local Citizen's Advice Bureau to ask about food banks
* Went to the food bank itself but was told they couldn't help me, broke down in front of them, too.
* Sat outside my local Job Centre in pseudo-protest

They don't make it easy for you, I can tell you that. They gave me basically no advice on how I could appeal, they never pointed me to any services that could help me.

yeah gamers like myself get offended by the association, it wasn't gamers at gamergate but misogynists with an agenda unrelated to gaming, the reply from the gaming community was either a reasonable reply criticising her methods, agreement, or a statement that the individual didn't give a fuck, and yeah maybe a little hate mail but we're really too buy gaming for anything more organised

Swatting is not a tactic originating from or exclusive to gaming, so the association is not fair to a community that is mostly welcoming.

Not too sure about hiking near Cambridge, its generally very flat around there. I mean a standard short walk from the center of Cambridge is along the river to grantchester, but that's only a couple of miles. You could walk in thetford forest maybe, that's not too far? Realistically most of the what i think is good hiking country is hours away from Cambridge, but if you are still keen then I guess the peak district would maybe be the best bet, at around 2 1/2 hours away by car?

null,null,Rimbaudelaire,flair5,,null,"I agree wholeheartedly, and this time around, it truly does look like the club is taking a longer perspective.  The stadium plans add a real sheen to visions of future Spurs.  

But in defence of the less patient supporter - wanting success is a cornerstone of watching sport / supporting a team, and it's tough to celebrate a well-run club - with a decent balance sheet and some good young players - ahead of a team that, you know, wins things (not that most of us have any ""choice"" in who you support!).  For me the best alternative is to have a lot of local / young players, for whom it's easier to root.  So having a bit of both right now is great.  

I would say also as an ""older"" supporter, for this sub at least, that every season is a ""transitional"" or ""building"" season for Spurs.  This is a trope that's prevalent since at least 1990 when my interest in football and Spurs really kicked in.  I'm sure the joke was kicking around before that, but certainly every year was a building year.  Often at the time, if felt as though we were building a great nucleus, and it was only in hindsight that the signings look bizarre etc.  

BUT: looking at the upward trend in the last 5-10 
years, with comparison to the preceding decade,  improvement is undeniable, if unblessed with silverware.  

38 game Prem finishes (95/96 start):

8-10-14-11-10-12-9-10-14-9-5-5-11-8-4-5-4-5-6-5

I think it's equally valid to wish, however unlikely given the relationship between finances and success (we pay the 6th most, so...) that Spurs had kicked on in the last few years.

In an unlikely analogy, Spurs suffer from a touch of the Atreides.  Every time Tottenham look like developing a team that's going to trouble the Empires-that-be, the Emperors of Utd and co. send in the Sardaukar money men to grab our best.  

""Hang on, that's the deadliest strike combo in the league...right Utd, you take Berba; Liverpool, you take Keane...  They don't have to work out, just make sure Spurs don't actually take our CL spots, eh.""

""Blimey, that Bale bloke...sort it out.  How much?  Damn, call Florentino, we'll get the Spanish government to buy him.  Right, now intercept that scout email to Levy, and replace the names with the following: Vlad Chiriches...""

Lucas is justifiably unhappy, but he's also justifiably excluded. We've kept two clean sheets without him, and Can's shown that he's the future at DM.

Borini, Enrique and Balotelli being made to train alone may seem really harsh, but the first two have shown an appetite to happily sit out their contracts, and Balotelli seems to remain Balotelli. It's in the club's best interests to do what it takes to move them on.

If Markovic/Moreno are unhappy - prove Rodgers wrong on the training ground. Heavens knows it's happened before - our new club captain is the best example of it.

With the transfer committee and the whole moneyball approach I dont think its fair to overly critise him for the transfers, which you havent. He isnt the manager of a team who are willing to splash money on whoever the manager wants. When you want Sanchez and end up being given the choice of Eto'o or Balotelli its hardly fair. But Lovren was a Rodgers signing and absolutely terrible so far.

What makes you say that about his man management? You just need to look at how much a number of young players have developed during his time at the club, e.g. Sterling, Ibe, Coutinho, all significantly improved, and he got some superb performances out of a distinctly average Flanagan. Not just player development, but resting Sterling last winter and sending him on a holiday is something not many managers would have done, came back reinvigorated. As well as dropping Mignolet, and look at how much better he has been since. Then tactically changing things to get the best out of Suarez and Sturridge, and now this season not being afraid to play it long to Benteke instead of trying to play it along the ground out of defence like we have the last few seasons.

Those are two completely different things, though, and neither of them necessarily accurately reflects a *majority or consensus* of all reddit users (as the poster who deleted their comments was talking about).

/r/all aggregates *and weights* posts by subreddit size, so all getting to the front page of r/all proves is that there is a small but vocal (and/or ideologically homogenous) minority in a particular subreddit that can muster enough support *given its size* to push objectional content up the rankings.

This is an argument for adjusting the ranking system or even ""quarantining"" objectional subreddits so they don't show up on /r/all, but it's in no way a valid argument that a majority or even a plurality of redditors support that content or agenda.

It's perhaps more forgivable to conflate the defaults with ""a majority of reddit supports this"", but it's still equally fallacious - the defaults are larger than non-default subreddits, but they're also reddit's low-investment/newbie/idiot sponges, and a lot of people only sign up in the first place to get away from them.

They're the largest communities on reddit, but their demographics are also subject to a systemic selection bias, with idiots and offensive people hugely overrepresented.

And that's leaving aside the whole fallacious assumption that just because something gets to the front page of *any* subreddit that most subscribers to it therefore agree with it.

First, most users simply don't vote, even on stuff they read. Second, headlines change so fast on busy subreddits (and worst of all in the defaults) that most users never even see most stories, as they've hit the front page and gone again before the user logs in each day. Thirdly, a vote does not necessarily imply agreement - many people vote this way, it's true, but others vote on newsworthiness, or to stimulate discussion, or to *highlight* ideas they find objectionable for scrutiny, or simply maliciously, to offended and annoy others.

All a post reaching the front page of a particular subreddit tells you is that a *plurality* of subscribers to it decided to vote it up; not a majority, and it tells you nothing about their motivations for doing so.

Even worse, when a post reaches the front page of r/all it tells you *nothing* about the majority of redditors; merely that there's a motivated and ideologically-homogeneous subcommunity of them that agree with it... and that reddit's ranking algorithm *by design* doesn't allow you to assume rankings on r/all function as a proxy for the overall community's consensus opinion *or* a comparative popularity metric between stories posted to different subreddits the way you assume it does.",null,0,null,1440003744,null,null,1440004146,0,cu8fq5c,null,t3_3hkdqe,null,null,null,t1_cu8akk2,null,null,null,1441345996,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

I definitely see what you are getting at, there is an annoying tendency to overhop every style of beer (i've noticed a lot of milds like this recently even though it's supposed to have no hop presence). However when a brewery advertises something as an IPA I expect it to have solid hop presence. If they have a spiel on the back about all the variety's of hops and the flavor they contribute I expect to taste it.

 I think there are plenty of bad IPAs out there that use hops to mask it, but there are also plenty of great IPAs, where the bitterness is controlled and the hops really shine. The U.S has etched out its own distinct style, and they are forcing a lot of other countries to up there game.

No matter what though as much as I love GoT, this is a very different type of show. This is a show that tends to mix low budget effects, creativity, cheesiness, great acting, and any setting or tone you can think of.  This is a show about *fun* and it's not taking itself super seriously trying to tell one long single story the way GoT is.

Anyway, the point is, yes the beginning is especially rough but it's ok to laugh at the silly effects and what not sometimes as the show itself is not trying to be ultra serious. Think of this more like Pixar movies, it's designed to be kid friendly but is actually more of a ""family"" oriented media that parents and kids can enjoy almost equally.

Here's the [trailer for the new season](http://youtu.be/bB8fh4QUy-A) staring in September which shouldn't give too much away for the stories you are at now but can give you sense of how it evolves over time.

Have you seen what kinds of degrees are being dished out? You have degrees in comedy, fashion buying, all sorts of bollocks. You know what you need a serious, full-time education for? Engineering. Science. Biochemistry. Being a doctor or a vet. You know what you *don't* need a serious, full-time education for? Comedy writing. Media Studies. Carpentry.

The kinds of degrees that people are getting would be put to far better use were they not degrees at all but were instead apprenticeship schemes or entry-level jobs. Someone, like myself, who 'studied' something completely pointless in uni would have benefited far more from doing a part-time entry-level job in a similar field to build experience, with part-time studies for theory.

The reason most graduates aren't in graduate jobs is because they weren't really interested in what their degree was, and if they were, they probably wouldn't need a degree to have a successful career in it (excluding science engineering medicine etc). The successful people I know who did 'pointless' degrees are the ones who are passionate about their hobby/career and have worked at it hard enough and for long enough and are talented enough to make a living from it.

The people I know who aren't successful in their graduated field are the ones who went to uni because they had no idea what they wanted to do yet and uni, no matter what kind of degree, was presumably the next logical step in a terrifying sea of adulthood.",null,0,null,1440003842,null,null,false,0,cu8fsl8,null,t3_3hjcxt,null,null,null,t3_3hjcxt,null,null,null,1441346028,null,3,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

HUH? The **only** way to rescue the country from the neoliberal agenda is to get elected.

People out of power are *impotent*. Michael Foot and Kinnock had dip-squat effect in the 1980's.

Mrs T privatised. She changed the law on working conditions. She cut taxes for the rich. She trashed entire communities. And your equivalent in the '80's protested and protested and protested and *didn't achieve a thing*. The only way to change things is to get into power and Benn and Corbyn deliberately made Labour unelectable and we couldn't get into power, they didn't achieve a thing.

As soon as a government realises the opposition is unelectable they think, Yes! We can do anything we want because regardless of what we do no one will elect the nutters opposite.

The only way to have an effect is to get elected, and the next best thing is to be electable, so the govt is fearful of losing seats.

To say ""we can't afford to think of electability""!!! You might as well just hand the keys to Osborne and tell him he's got Downing Street for the next twenty years. Because Labour isn't going to think about electability. Hell, why even bother to contest any seats if you have that attitude.

People act like in a league season teams are expected to beat everyone who isn't in the top five, both home and away, and the games that really matter are the '6-pointers'. We could lose to Man Utd, Chelsea, Arsenal and Man City in every game and if we beat everyone else (as apparently we're expected to) we'd still finish on 90 points and most years win the league. Top clubs routinely drop points against mid-table and relegation battle sides on an almost weekly basis these days, and every game we get through without dropping points is a big deal. 

Last season we drew with Hull at home (the equivalent team to Bournemouth) and lost 6-1 away at Stoke. This year, regardless of how convincing the performances were or were not, we've taken 6 points from two games that last year gave us only 1. And for context that 5 point improvement is relative to us ending up 8 points behind 4th last season, despite it being a shitshow. 

We've not blown Stoke or Bournemouth away as fans would probably like us to, but we've still ground out two results against teams who would happily take a draw - something that Liverpool sides have been utterly shite at doing over the last ten years. We managed to put ourselves in a position where a lucky goal or favourable decision from the ref wins us the game, rather than failing to score, going 1-0 down to a set piece, and then failing to do anything against a side happy to park the bus for the rest of the game.

For the ex forces one, stop putting up all these campaigns that claim they are helping when it is more for publicity. Granted yes they will help some people but some people just fall through cracks. The Armed forces need to prep people for coming out better than giving them a few month terminal leave. Put a program in place to teach how to pay bills where to go for help and such. Start off the housing application prior to leaving to ensure a better chance of being housed and finally how to provide for yourself to pay bills and such if you have no job, time keeping for any ex forces is not a problem. 

As for people being given sanctions, maybe when hiring to a course to ensure the workers you are hiring are more compassionate and understanding. Not just resort to sanction at the first point of contact for them. Do these courses in house for current staff also. They dont require a specially trained person to tell you that your being an asshole to people who need help. Give people 3 strikes and if they fail to turn up again then bring them in for a talk and a way to make a solution for the reasons causing them to have problems with signing on. People have valid reasons for being late or not turning up, I had this problem myself. My tablets I have to take daily cause my to lose consciousness every now and then, so over sleeping can be a easy thing to do. If I dont take the tablets I am in too much pain to move.

Adding playoffs will mean no team will be able to win the title 3/4ths of the way through the end of the year. It would guarantee drama and important matches towards the end of the season every single year. TV networks love regularly scheduled matches of significance and prestige. That's why American sports pull in so much money, people know ahead of time when the important games will be, and people will be interested because it will give non old firm teams a chance to win titles every year, giving more hope/ interest to teams outside the old firm that their team has a chance to win something.

I know there's the cups but they aren't the same. The league is the big title in Scotland with the most prestige. It would make Scottish football have a different an interesting element to it that other leagues in Europe have. And I still think the biggest problem the league has is that a non old firm team hasn't won since the mid 80s.

null,null,kingofeggsandwiches,null,null,null,"Depends on what you mean by mickey mouse, I did PPE which was considered one of the best academic courses for getting on graduate schemes at the time, now people scorn it for not being practical enough. People who do psychology for example are not messing around, they have to learn plenty of numerical, statistical skills alongside others, yet people tell them it's useless. 

It's getting to the point where people are scorning kids for studying anything that it's entirely practical with well defined career path to follow. 

Most academic degrees have no direct ""practical use"" in the real world, yet up until relatively recently they were very useful for getting employment after one graduated. 

If you're talking about surf studies or whatnot well yeah they are mickey mouse degrees, but they rarely found anyone employment in the past. Point is we can't just label anything that doesn't have direct practical application to industry as ""mickey mouse"", it used to suffice that people studied a tough academic subject from a respectable institution. That alone used to get one a job with a bit of effort. It's only in recent times with the over saturation of graduates and the recession have meant that anyone without highly valued directly applicable skills is struggling to find a position. Due to the economic climate companies are simply not taking the risk on new graduates when they can simply make do with what they have. 

Believe me it's not just people who took joke degrees that are having to take sub-par positions. Half the people who graduated with me (from a top 10 University) are doing crap like social media management, administration and such hoping that they'll be able to break into a real job some day.

But I wouldn't call her ignorant on the subject simply because she hasn't read certain books (which, lets be honest, a lot of this sub probably haven't read). 

Although, yeah, she could have done more research into the subject.

&gt;""So if you've misspelt ‘artron energy’ because you've only ever heard it spoken and thought it was ‘arktron’, I was like, ‘Oh sorry I got that bit of completely imaginary physics wrong.’""

But you would never have, say, Romana or the Rani regenerate into a male sex if you look at them as characters, which we do. But if we look at them as members of the species of Time Lords, then there would be no reason for them not to.

I'm not saying that the Doctor, and by extension the writers, should ignore that it is a possibility for Time Lords to change sex/gender, I'm just saying that I would prefer that it didn't happen.


But anyway, as much as I like debating with someone, I've gotten off track. 

My original point was that she wasn't closed minded because she seems to have considered those other concepts and ideas, so she isn't unreceptive to them she has just chosen other concepts and ideas over those. I guess that comes down to how you read the article.

You can make semi-credible arguments about culture shifting a bit thanks to immigration (no bad thing in my opinion). You can also make half an argument about immigration increasing housing demand (though that is really a failure for government to plan for economically useful immigration by building more houses). What you can't do credibly is claim that importing hard-working, working age immigrants has somehow damaged the country economically.

That second leg against Porto made them look pretty exciting to me and it wasn't tiki-taka. But I also love watching Pellegrini's faster style, so I'm happy either way. 

I don't know why people are so eager to get Klopp over Pep though, even with their many injuries, they shouldn't have been in the relegation zone midway through the season and have to fight their way to midtable. His Dortmund side was fun to watch, but some of that blame has to go to the manager in my opinion. I'm also of the opinion that his style is what caused so many injuries.

null,null,dr_barnowl,null,null,null,"Really don't see how it's unrelated to gaming when it was all associated with people making feminist critique (however flawed) about .. gaming. And people were making pretty strong statements about how these women were not real gamers, and that girls who expressed an interest were ""fake geek girls""
And calling themselves ""GamerGate"". And claiming it was all about ethics in games journalism. And calling swattings directed against critics of GamerGate.

I totally get that this does not represent the vast majority of gamers (not least because... [more than half of gamers are women](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/18/52-percent-people-playing-games-women-industry-doesnt-know)... ). I'm a gamer myself. I even enjoy games like the Witcher series which have attracted some criticism for their portrayal of women.. AND enjoyed that portrayal of women (I'm clearly a filthy pervert..) .. of the opinion that there is a fine line between a game being misogynistic and merely portraying a setting that is misogynistic (hard to examine misogynism in the lens of culture without portraying it, or some other bias that is easily translatable). I think the musings of Sarkeesian et al can be a little skewed... just like the positions of other people with strong opinions. But similarly I don't interpret them as a hostile all-out attack, more like an invitation to consider the details of one of my hobbies and it's implications a little more carefully. As I'm father to a young daughter, I welcome some light being shone around the dark corners of things. I'm OK with there being games like Dragon's Crown because I think choice is important (I can imagine my daughter's response to the character portrayals and it's probably ""Ew, gross."")  but I'd definitely like to see more games like Remember Me and Tomb Raider with strong female characters... I enjoy playing strong female characters too! And yes, partly because I think they're attractive, but I don't see that as wrong, just inevitable given my age and orientation. And partly because I see my daughter responding well to this kind of character and feel pleased that she can have heroes as well.

You wouldn't dispute that terrorist bombings were generally inspired by religion, or that they were probably not just pure religion but mixed with some other kind of strong, twisted motivators as well. I think of GamerGate the same way - those guys have some other twisted, strong motivators going on in their lives, but you can't entirely separate them from gaming the same way you can't separate ISIS from Islam.",null,0,null,1440004936,null,null,false,0,cu8gkus,null,t3_3hkdqe,null,null,null,t1_cu8f4io,null,null,null,1441346398,null,-6,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-6,null

I expect both of these two to continue improving, but I think there are takeaways we can fairly accept as near fact at this point after only one season. Mason is (already) 24 and has only looked an overall positive when paired with a CDM destroyer type (i.e. not Bentaleb). Bentaleb is skilled defensively no doubt, as evidenced by his relatively successful emergency cover as an actual defender, but like almost any other midfielder, will struggle when trying to balance going forward and sitting back when paired with someone as undisciplined as Mason.

I really truly do not think those two are a successful long term Premier League midfield. Mason pretty much is what he is at this point, and that's fine. There is nothing wrong with Mason being a early EL/cup match midfielder who is paired with a true DM. Given our strong second team back line, and a hypothetical attack of Berahino up front with Pritchard-Carroll-Lamela/N'Jie/Dembele playing behind, I genuinely think a Mason/Stambouli combination would have a lot of success.

I could make that claim that ""98% of rape accusation are false"" and it would be just as valid because I would only be presuming innocence where others presume guilt.

These stats real or not could also just as easily be turned around. Some statistics state that 50% of rape cases get thrown out by the police. Therefore ""50% of rape accusations are too tenuous to even be brought to court"".

I'll try to help you understand the way I see it. What I'm going to say may not be 100% correct in reality, these are just my views on the matter:

 A lot of new supporters don't want to be known as ""new"", since it's ""cooler"" to be a long-time supporter. So a lot of new supporters try to seem ""cool"" by pretending to be long-time supporters.. pretending to know it all.

Yeah, this isn't a great approach, but (and this is the important part) it's borne from the new supporters seeing long-time supporters perpetuating the idea that being a long-time supporter is ""cool"" or superior to being a new supporter.

Seemingly, then, the solution to this would be to remove the rift between new and long-time supporters by removing the supposed superiority of being a long-time supporter.",null,0,null,1440005735,null,null,false,0,cu8h5d3,null,t3_3hkodp,null,null,null,t1_cu86hgr,null,null,null,1441346666,null,5,null,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,5,null

With all due respect, you are cherry picking information to fit into your own opinion. It does not take long at all to find websites, letters to the editors and academic papers which directly question the validity of this study - it's not like the critics are simply limited to pro-vaping websites.

The fact is that the wider scientific community generally hold the view that this study was poorly designed and did not at all replicate real life conditions.

I suggest you read the article entitled *""Evaluation of Electronic Cigarette Use (Vaping) Topography and Estimation of Liquid Consumption: Implications for Research Protocol Standards Definition and for Public Health Authorities’ Regulation""* which was published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, which goes some way to explain why the article you linked was flawed, take the following extract as an example (but remember, this is backed up by not only this study, but a number of others.)

Keep in mind that they were good by the standards of 2005, and a *phenomenal* improvement over the classic series. 

Now granted, Series 1 has a few episodes that are duds. Fortunately, you are past most of them and about to get into the real meat. Nevertheless, the reason why Series 1 is STILL the best place to start for new Doctor Who fans is that it corrects the mistake of the TV Movie, which is trying to cram 50 years of backstory down our throats. Series 1 does an outstanding job of feeding us all of the important information about Doctor Who a little bit at a time without overwhelming us, so that by the end of the season, we know all of the relevant details about the show. For example, ""Rose"" simply introduces the character and the TARDIS, shows what the Doctor does. ""The End of the World"" uses the TARDIS to take us to the future for the first time and explains why everyone in the universe speaks English, and ""The Unquiet Dead"" takes us to the past and we meet a famous historical figure. ""Aliens of London"" introduces the third major category of plot, the invasion of Earth scenario, and briefly introduces us to UNIT. ""Dalek"" introduces us to the Doctor's greatest enemy, and provides the backstory on the Time War. ""Father's Day"" shows us the dangers of time travel and paradoxes. ""Boom Town"" has a nice explanation about the Chameleon Circuit. It goes on and on. You'd figure all of this out eventually by watching later episodes, but Series 1 hits all the major points really well and helps you not be confused later on.

Public opinion has shifted over legalisation of certain drugs in 2013 53% polled supported Cannabis legalisation. Yet it still illegal due to ideology. Plus calling people stupid and selfish doesn't really help the conversation. A lot of the negative fall out from drug use could be eliminated by legalisation.

Also media shifting has just been made illegal, even though it's a common practice which has been going on for decades now.

 &gt;And all of us will have to live with the consequences.

Everyone live just fine with common alcohol use. The world hasn't ended for non drinkers.

&gt; In any case, all you are arguing for is that I should push for alcohol to be as outlawed as other drugs, which isn't doing wonders for your position is it?

Strange leap of logic. Not what I'm arguing for at all. But if you want to be consistent with your ideology of outlawing anything potentially bad for humans then yes knock yourself out it doesn't effect my position at all. As illegally brewed alcohol has potentially damaging side effects that wouldn't be found in legally brewed regulated alcohol.

Moonshine for example if brewed incorrectly can contain Methanol which can lead to blindness and death.  

Plus alcohol was in the hands on organised crime and with all the negative side effects that brings during prohibition of the 1920's in the US.

If anything it would not help YOUR position.

https://www.drinkaware.co.uk/check-the-facts/effects-on-your-safety/the-dangers-of-fake-alcohol

&gt;Health risks from fake alcohol Properly produced and certified alcoholic drinks are made with ethanol – alcohol that’s safe to drink in moderation. But fake alcoholic drinks can be produced using other cheaper types of alcohol which can have serious adverse effects on your health. Drinkaware’s Chief Medical Advisor Professor Paul Wallace explains: “Commonly used substitutes for ethanol include chemicals used in cleaning fluids, nail polish remover and automobile screen wash, as well as methanol and isopropanol which are used in antifreeze and some fuels. These other types of alcohol can produce similar effects to ethanol in terms of making you feel tipsy. But they are also potentially very dangerous.” 

&gt;Drinking alcohol containing these chemicals can cause nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, drowsiness and dizziness. Drinking it can lead to kidney or liver problems and even coma. Methanol, the substance which has been found in fake vodka (4) can cause permanent blindness.

Pretty much sums up why illegalising alcohol would be stupid as the practices above such as putting polish remover into alcoholic drinks would become more common in blackmarket produced drinks.

I dont think any of the players are a magic solution like some people here think they are. I would like for them to get more of a shot in the first team. but pretending like adding them will make us suddenly invincible or world-beaters is a little naive. 

&gt; They are simply players Rodgers doesn't like because they aren't ""his"" players.

people parrot this all the time, maybe they dont fit in the way he is trying to play tactically. or maybe they have just been fucking up horribly in training. have we had any proof of people being left out because Rodgers doesnt fancy them? honest question and it would most certainly alter my opinion of Rodgers if true. Also not trying to absolve Rodgers of all responsibility. he certainly deserves a large amount of criticism. 

 But im certainly in the camp of letting him do his thing at least until his thing is leading us astray.

I was denied benefits in February because I'd ""left of [my] own free will"". Never mind that it was completely uneconomical for me to keep working there. It's now August. I have my initial JSA interview tomorrow. If I didn't have my family to support me, I'd not have survived this long.

So, there was no hype because it was just another episode of Doctor Who. Honestly, I must have watched each of that 2 parter like 15 times. There was such a feeling of desperation in it.

I don't know if i'd go that far seeing as the show has evolved a lot over the years.  not only does every new doctor bring something new, but the overall production quality has improved in leaps and bounds imo.  if you're not a fan of the first season, i think it's okay to skip forward a bit until you find something you like  :-)

I had a similar experience where I'd heard great things about the show, but could never get into it.  i started watching the the first (2005) episode with the mannequins on three occasions, but never even made it through the whole thing - it seemed too cheesy/campy and dated.

as i've said, the show has improved a lot in terms of production and tone. just two weeks ago, i decided to give it another chance starting with season 5.  I've now watched all four of the remaining seasons in that time.  you won't regret it if stick it out in the early stages, or even jump forward to the more recent episodes.

The first cost to consider is the court and appeal costs:
&gt;New York state projected that the death penalty costs the state $1.8 million per case just through trial and initial appeal.
I do approve of the fact that death penalty investigations are more thorough. It shows that the justice system is aware it may miscarry.

So the current cost stands at $1,800,000 for death penalty, $0 for life imprisonment (I know court cases for life imprisonment is not free, but I can't be arsed to find the costs out).

&gt;It costs more to house death penalty prisoners, as well. In Kansas, housing prisoners on death row costs more than twice as much per year ($49,380) as for prisoners in the general population ($24,690)

I wonder why this is the case. I believe death row should be treated the same as any other prisoner, what are the extra costs for?

Wikipedia says:
&gt;In 2010, a death row inmate waited an average of 178 months (roughly 15 years) between sentencing and execution.

$2,540,700 for death penalty, $370,350 for 15 years in a life sentence.

And finally, the death itself:

&gt;it’s estimated that the drugs run about $100 (the Texas Department of Criminal Justice put the cost of their drug cocktails at $83 in 2011).

So it tallies up at $2,540,800 to $370,350 at the time of death of the death row inmate. It will take 44 years for the life imprisoned inmate to finally match the cost of the death row inmate.

Brendan has his job and the fans don't make the decision about whether we keep him or not. The owners decided he stays so he stays. The fan's faith in him means nothing and those fans that think they deserve something are wrong. 

Fan favorites mean shit. Should be bring back Kuyt?  If Sakho is fit and is training harder and better than Lovren or Skrtel then bring him in. But just because he's ""Frances future captain"" doesn't mean shit. If he deserves to play then he'll play. People really want to believe that Rodgers is ignorant or has malice against Sakho. Maybe he's injured or took too much time off for his kid and isn't in match shape. Maybe something else is going on. We don't know and being a ""fan"" of the player shouldn't impact Brendan's decision about who plays. So far Lovren has played 2 games and only 3 SHOTS have been allowed. Now we're taking him out because we like Sakho more? Lovren needs to prove he's shit before we bench him. Whether in training or on the pitch. But until then there's no point. 

Maybe last year Skrtel and Lovren were time bombs. But 2 years before that we were selling Henderson. Last year Sturridge never played. Previous seasons can only take us so far, especially when a player was new to the team or in a new system. The only information we have now is that Brendan has picked a team that won us games. We can argue about who is better or not all day but we don't have all the information. It's all gut feeling, FIFA rankings and youtube highlight videos to guide us. I'm not trying to argue that Brendan is 100% right or that Lovren is our best CB. But to argue that we should bench him for no reason besides his performance in some games last year but not argue that we should play him due to his performance at Southampton is ridiculous to me. We can only judge a player based on results and performance. And NOT KNOWING something about a player doesn't make them better.

Here's how it could pan out in a small IT company. The guys all earn £100k writing gaming software, but employ a secretary on 20k and an in-house cleaner on above the minimum wage (which works out at about £10k). Everyone has perks because this is an IT start-up and they like doing that stuff. 

Corbyn brings in his rule. Company sacks cleaner to ensure the lowest paid is now the secretary and out sources the cleaning. The new out-sourced cleaner now takes a pay cut down to minimum wage, and loses her perks. So the IT staff are still earning nicely and their company is merrily going along, but the cleaner loses out thanks to Corbyn. The cleaning company owner being savvy doesn't pay herself a salary at all, she pays herself dividends. So she's exempt too.

Scenario 2. Larger company that has a range of staff at a range of salaries. They shift the high paying staff to Dublin, which lowers the salaries in the UK. The staff are paid the same under this scenario, but HM govt loses all the lovely tax revenue from the higher paying people (because they are now abroad). This impact Corbyn's spending plans.

Corbyn is an utter *fool* - and yes his maximum wage is anti-business and hard left. No amount of spinning will change that.

&gt; Also and excuse my ignorance but to help me understand the teams better, can someone give me a list of “The Chelsea’s, the Man Utd’s, the Arsenal’s” of the Conference

Well there kind of aren't, because by definition if you win, you go up and can't defend your title. But briefly you can group them like this:

The big ex league boys: 

These spent the overwhelming majority of their history in the football league and tend to draw very big crowds (remember, with no TV money crowd size are super important to how much money you have). In the last few years the conference has lost a few of these in both directions, but right now I'd say it's Grimsby, Wrexham, Lincoln, Torquay, Tranmere and Cheltenham.

The sugar daddy clubs: 

Forest Green are this season's big example, with money pouring in out of all proportion to how big the crowds are. These vary a lot with how well they will do though. I seem to remember that Guiseley have a backer, but he's not as rich as Forest Green's.

The neither here nor there full time clubs: 

These are the full time clubs without particularly huge crowds, nor a backer, but with the conference being such a tight division could have a crack at the playoffs if they put together a good run. Equally a bad run could see them in the relegation battle.

The part time clubs: 

These guys don't train all week, the players are expected to have other jobs (or be students, or just live with their parents) and only train two evenings a week. Clubs within this bracket will argue till they're blue in the face about which of them is the biggest, but in performance terms, all of them just want to avoid being relegated. Some of them are Conference stalwarts, some of them are yoyo clubs and some of them have done amazing to get that high.

There's also teams that are hard to categorise (Chester and Halifax are both phoenix clubs of former Football League clubs). I couldn't tell you what every team in the division is (one annoying thing about the conference is there's no easy place to look all this up).

null,null,harrythefurrysquid,null,null,null,"Has to be more than that - they actually have to serve you notice. This can be served any time after the contract has been signed, however: some agents do this routinely.

The notice must be valid, however:

* Deposit must be protected
* Protection scheme information must have been provided
* Names of tenants must be correct
* Address of property must be correct
* Notice must be served at least 2 months before the date
* The date must be at or after the end of the fixed term
* Notice must be in writing

My advice in this case would be much the same as /u/mediocrity511 : contact the landlord directly to reassure them that you want to stay, and string the letting agent along as needed until the fixed term has expired. Worked well for me, anyway.

Note that even if the S21 notice is served, you don't actually have to leave. You can wait for a court order and bailiffs to evict you. Generally this would be a dick move, but the practical effect here is that someone actually has to start proceedings - so if you have good communication with the landlord, it would be difficult for the letting agent to proceed further, even if they've served you the paperwork. Furthermore, getting written (e.g. email) agreement from the Landlord that they're happy for you to stay for at least a stated period under a period tenancy muddies the water as to whether a prior S21 notice is even still valid - probably enough to force another one to be served.

Go to your local Citizens advice bureau if you haven't already, they will give you a ton of help if you don't mind waiting a bit also they can give you tokens for food banks.
You can apply to get whites (cooker, fridge, washer etc) from the council for free, if you don't need it, sell it.
You can apply for a Budgeting loan through the jobcenter, you only pay back what you lend and they take it out of your benefit ( not ideal but it's money )
Apply for Hardship payments, it's about £30 a week.
Put a sign in your local shop for Dogwalker/Handyman, something along those lines.
You can also ask for Gas/electric voucher from the council, usually get £15, which you could also sell if you know someone who wants to trade money for the voucher.

Also I'm not sure about now but last time I got sanctioned they stopped housing benefit and everything, so if you live in your own place make sure to check what's happening with that, debt with the council is the last thing you need at this point.

I was in the exact same position as you a few years back and I started to steal food etc, i got caught once or twice I was VERY very lucky and got let go each time, I know how it seems but it's not worth the risk, you'd be surprised how kind and considerate some shopkeepers are when you are flat out honest with them.

Such a long list of players who show lots of potential, Lucas Piazon, Izzy Brown, Dominic Solanke, Christensen, Kalas, Boga, Musonda, Swift, Boga, Ake, Abraham, Aina, Van Ginkel, Nathan, probably now Kenedy

But Mou doesn't trust them. We talk about these guys all the time, but truth is with Mou as manager, a fraction of them will ever make the Chelsea squad, let alone be regulars. 
The way Mou sees it these guys won't make the first team but selling them down the road will give Chelsea pockets of profit-- with which Mou can buy other players. 

If you look at the loan lists of all the top Premier League clubs, our is the largest BY FAR. I think this is the standard that Chelsea's academy has set.

As I posted in reply to another comment above, IME the best fish and chips can be found at the coast.  There's some good chippies in Whitstable, about an hour to the south-east of London by train.  That's gonna be quite a trek from Cambridge though.

null,null,BradyBunch88,null,null,null,"Thank you for your detailed response! You’re right in saying that it is a bit vague however, it’s not as straight forward and simple as the Premier League / Championship I imagine. I think it’s more about the fans and a cult following that each team has. Which is nice. The higher you go the more money is involved and sometimes that’s good, sometimes that’s bad. Lower leagues is purely about the football and I kind of like that!

Does the current Conference table reflect how the season will end? Comparing last years table, to this years as well as some research I’ve done it does seem to me that Southport may get relegated as well as Kidderminster and Aldershot. Obviously though, it’s so early on in the season it’s hard to say.
I’m just curious about where the fans of the Conference see the table playing out. Top five? Bottom four? Top goalscorer? Ryan Bowman does look like he can bang in a few goals and he’s already on 5.

What’s the style of play? Do managers go out with a formation and play tactically? Or is it more relaxed?

What draws people to these football games? Is it because they’re fed up of all the money and politics that run the Premier League, UEFA Champions League and such competitions? Or is it more to do with - for example - your dad used to take you to a Lincoln City football match and you enjoyed that experience, you’ve supported them ever since? Would you say there’s more of a personal relationship with the club and the players than there is with say, Chelsea fans and their players?

Though that is not your issue, as you would expect that if the promise was made then the manager would reasonably deemed by you to have the authority to make the offer in the first place.

 Make sure that you document in a email (or letter) concisely the offer that was made in simple and clear wording. I suggest email as you will be emailing presumably a company email address.
Be polite but firm as if you get the pay rise you will have work with this manager in the future.
Ask for a response yeah or neigh from the manager within say 10 working days

Wait 7 days - if you do not get an answer by then remind the manager of the request and ask how it is going.
If they still haven't acted reply that you may need to make this a formal grievance.

after 10 days see how the land lies as you may now need to make this a formal grievance to HR (of which there are lots of advice on the ACAS site for this. 
But early on (i.e. Your dealings with the manager) don't confuse the issue, concentrate on the ""significant"" pay rise.
If the pay rise puts you below £18k (above keep your trap shut), if less than £18k or nil then make the grievance formal at this point throw in the pay disparity, your gender and performance review as reasons for feeling that you have been treated unfairly.

I have recently had to deal with this exact issue, a manager made an offer that they were not authorised to make, result was I authorised the rise as the person was good at their job, we had spent 12 weeks training them, and recruitment costs are expensive. I also gave the manager a written warning for not following organisational procedure. 
Just hope they do not try taking their mistake out on the employee, but I'll deal with this if it arises.

These documents argued the case for concern over possible weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) in Iraq. Both have been criticised as overstating or distorting the actual intelligence findings. Subsequent investigation revealed that the September Dossier had been altered, **on Campbell's orders**, to be consistent with a speech given by George W.

null,null,SylvieK,lfc99,,null,"Here are some factors that make me question BR, though I will be happy to be proven wrong. 

* **Team Selection/Tactics:** There doesn't seem to be much predictability in lineup and formation on a week to week basis. Though our starting lineup was the same the last two games, player positioning was different. It feels like players are constantly being asked to play in positions that are different from where they naturally excel, so that ultimately its hard for anyone to really settle into a stable role. Of course, many times this has to do with setting up a plan to match the week's opponent, but as often as not, those tactics fail, and substitutions come late. Players who should start are often not even on the bench, in-game substitutions happen late or not at all, etc. 

* **Player/Man Management:** Related to team selection, the obviously controversial issues with Sakho and Lucas being isolated. From last season, Allen getting so many looks into the squad last season despite poor form. Sticking to Lovren - may yet pay off, but may not. Also related somewhat is how much informaiton seems to leak out of Melwood regarding player/manager relations. I don't know of any other top 5 club that seems to leak as much 'news' about player/manager falling-outs as we do. Sterling, Lucas, Sakho, Balotelli -  we're always hearing rumors and innuendo. Why? I know we can't blame BR for leaks, I suppose its something the club needs to manage better -but still, why is it leaking out? Is there fire where there's smoke? 

* **Youth:** I really appreciate BR giving so many young players a chance, but here's my ultimate question - when will our youngsters be given a chance to play in their natural positions? Or to even find out where their natural positions are in a stable lineup? Sterling was played in various different positions, Gomez naturally a CB is lining up at LCB, Can naturally a ? lines up at ?... the list goes on. I'm sure our youngsters are happy for the chance, but doesn't this hamper their development? And given our team is so filled with  youngsters, won't this hamper our team? 

* **What kind of football do we play?** What are we trying to build towards? Leave 13/14 aside -that was lightning in a bottle, once-in-a-lifetime type stuff. All the stars very nearly aligned for us that season. But before and after that - what kind of footballing style/philosphy are we building towards? Slow build up/Possession? High-PressCounter-attack? Direct/Long-balls? It just seems like week-to-week and season-to-season, there's been no real crystallization of what kind of Football we are aiming to play... and that's sort of the main frustration to me.

From https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/post/problems-with-post/problems-with-post-delivery/you-re-receiving-someone-else-s-mail/

&gt; Opening someone else’s mail is allowed in certain circumstances under the Postal Services Act 2000. It is only an offence if you open someone else’s mail ‘without reasonable excuse’ or if you ‘intend to act to another’s detriment'. For example, if you are receiving bank statements/cards in someone else’s name then you should act on that immediately. You should tell the sender, either by returning it marked “not known at this address” or by opening the mail and calling any number provided within. The “reasonable excuse” for opening such items would then be that you were helping to prevent fraud against the companies involved.


The relevant section of the law. http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/26/part/V

&gt; A person commits an offence if, intending to act to a person’s detriment and without reasonable excuse, he opens a postal packet which he knows or reasonably suspects has been incorrectly delivered to him.

No, no. The flat is not suitable for couples due to regulations, it's a one person flat only and you will not be allowed to move in with your GF. What we can suggest you, we have another studio, next door for £600, so maybe you can take both flats, one for you and your GF"".

1. Article 8 means the government shouldn't interfere with our private life (the human right),

2. ... unless there is a specific reason for doing so, set out in Article 8(2),

3. So if there isn't a valid reason for criminalising certain drugs, banning them would be a breach of the right to private life,

null,null,Helpopotamus,lfc87,,null,"&gt; Brendan has his job and the fans don't make the decision about whether we keep him or not. The owners decided he stays so he stays. The fan's faith in him means nothing and those fans that think they deserve something are wrong. 

This article is about him still getting grief from fans, and I commented as such. Your point here is completely fucking pointless. Shall we not discuss anything to do with the club then since it doesn't make a fucking difference? Do one. It's absurd to suggest that because the owners make the decisions fans cant have a fucking opinion, especially when the whole article is about Rodgers still not impressing the fans of the club he fucking manages.

Laughably comparing Sakho to Kuyt are we? One is nearly in his prime, the other is in his mid thirties bit of a difference. Sakho happens to be a fan favourite because he's actually pretty good still and people want him playing over a defender who has had a calamitous time so far.

&gt;  It's all gut feeling, FIFA rankings and youtube highlight videos to guide us. I'm not trying to argue that Brendan is 100% right or that Lovren is our best CB. But to argue that we should bench him for no reason besides his performance in some games last year but not argue that we should play him due to his performance at Southampton is ridiculous to me. We can only judge a player based on results and performance. And NOT KNOWING something about a player doesn't make them better. Potential is not reality - which a lot of people on this sub don't seem to get. 

Absolute dross. Lets just not debate football then. The fact your comment is upvoted is far more of a show how out out touch this sub is with match day fans.

Likewise post-2008, people literally saw how politics impacted their lives as many lost their jobs, or had pay frozen/cut.  Labour (like most Western governments) were blamed and lost the election as a result.

1997 was the result of a weariness with the Conservative government over a long period of perceived incompetence, rather than specific events that massively influenced people's lives. This makes the swing Blair got all the more remarkable.

It's important to remark that Thatcher did moderate her views for the 1979 election. Like Blair, she waited until her second term to carry out more serious reforms.  For Corbyn to win he would need to seriously moderate his views. This is not impossible.  He already has the full backing of the left of the party, and I think it unlikely he would lose that support. This should give him the confidence to moderate his views to try and win round the centrists in the party, and those who have no particular allegiance to any political party. However, as I said it would also require a tangible event like the 2008 crash or Winter of Discontent where people can clearly see the negative results of a Tory government.

Before he got the job doing dishes at an old folks home, he did petty theft and slung meth. He was in and out of juvy a few times. The last time he was in a facility, about two or three years prior, his little sister (about twelve at the time) was hit by a car and died.

He didn't exactly have his head on straight, but he saw what that did to his mom. He had been something of a disappointment to her, but they still loved each other, and he saw the toll that burying a child inflicted on her.

""14. Do data subjects have a right to request the deletion of their data?
The FTC's Behavioural Advertising Principles do not give data subjects a right to request the deletion of their data. However, the White House's 2012 Privacy Report and Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights (which may be the basis for new voluntary codes of conduct) state that, ""companies also should provide consumers with reasonable access to personal data that they collect or maintain about them, as well as the appropriate means and opportunity to correct inaccurate data or request its deletion or use limitation"".
The HIPAA allows individuals to request an amendment of their personal information when that information is inaccurate or incomplete, but the covered entity is not obligated to grant that request.
The California Online Privacy Protection Act requires operators of web sites, online services and mobile apps that are directed to minors, or that have actual knowledge that a minor is using their site or service, to permit a minor who is a registered user to remove or request the removal of certain online information that the user posted. The law does not require companies to remove data from their servers, as long as they delete it from their websites, and the law does not apply to content for which the minor 'received compensation or other consideration.'""

I'm glad you're so welcoming.

I look forward to the day when I have a local soccer club I can support over here (nothing above the lowest league, right now), but I know I'm going to be a Chelsea supporter for life. I spent about 3 months living in South Kensington off of Earl's Court last year for an internship abroad, and even though no matches were held at the Bridge that summer, I at least feel I have the slightest glimmer of legitimacy as an American Chelsea supporter. I mean, the first thing I did when I dropped my bags off was go (accidentally) sneak into the stadium and sat there in the stands, the only soul in the whole place. I'll never forget that sight, even though the only view I've had of the players on that pitch is through my TV or laptop.

&gt; You must have a biometric residence permit (BRP) if you want to:

&gt; apply to come to the UK 

&gt; apply to extend your visa or settle in the UK

&gt; transfer your visa to a new passport 

&gt; apply for certain Home Office travel documents 

And, from https://www.gov.uk/transfer-visa:

&gt; ! You don’t have to transfer your visa - you can carry both your old and new passports when travelling to or from the UK instead.

And from the Guidance document for employers:

&gt; Under current legislation, employers have a responsibility to check the entitlement of prospective employees to work in the UK. We strongly advise that employers undertake checks on everyone they wish to employ. This will enable employers to establish a statutory defence against payment of a civil penalty for employing a person with no right to work in the UK, shows their recruitment process is open and transparent, and ensures their recruitment practices do not discriminate against anyone because of their race.

&gt; Migrants who are eligible to work in the UK are strongly encouraged to collect their BRP before they start work. If they need to start work prior to collecting their BRP they will be able to evidence their right to work by producing the short validity vignette in the passport they used to travel to the UK. A right to work check can be conducted on the basis of this vignette. Once the vignette in the passport has expired the migrant must collect their BRP. The employer must then need to conduct a right to work check on the basis of the BRP once the migrant has collected it.

I'll still apply for the BRP now that I know about it -- like the author, we did not get such information -- but it sounds like the ILR vignette in the passport is sufficient.

Also I'm not sure who was breathing down either of Rafa's or Rodgers' necks the seasons we finished second. There certainly wasn't the near toxic pressure Rodgers is under these seasons.

In fact, the number of times I can remember when pressure from fans and the board was the most intense was during some of the lower ebbs of the last 20 years for Liverpool. Hodgson was under intense pressure from the off and that certainly did help us, we got beat by Blackpool etc. More importantly the most extreme case of that accountability I can think of was the pressure the board put Roy Evans under by employing another man, Houllier, to directly oversee and contribute to his managerial decisions.

Take tobacco for example. The cost of smoking to the NHS is estimated to be £2 billion a year, yet the money raised through taxation in 2013 to 2014 was £9.5 billion. If other substances were to be legalised and taxed in a similar fashion, I'm sure that the taxes raised will be higher than the cost to the taxpayer. The gap between the cost and revenue should be even higher for many drugs compared to tobacco, as tobacco is one of the more harmful drugs to the user and others, along with alcohol.

How exactly? I'm not disagreeing with your other points, but I fail to understand the mentality behind people proclaiming Can is our new defensive midfielder. We've seen him play in that position maybe two or three times, none have looked that convincing, but because he made a great tackle in the 92nd minute he's exactly what we need and are looking for? 

Can has too many attacking tendencies right now to be anywhere near our most trusted or used DM: he frequently finds himself out of position, and positional awareness is something that is integral to the true DM. Look at Wanyama, Schneiderlin, Matic...players that hardly ever venture forward and always believe in defence first. Can isn't in that mould yet, and its naive to believe that he could be for the rest of the season. He's no replacement to Lucas, however we try to tie up the bow we're showing ourselves.

Let's take the 25th most marginal Tory seat - Peterborough - as an example.

Majority - 1,925, non-voters - around 16,000 or about 8 times the majority (just short of the entire current Labour vote and 2000 short of the overall Tory vote). Peterborough has some very deprived inner city areas - just the sort of people that feel too disconnected from politics to vote and just the sort of people that a properly targeted anti-austerity policy could reach. 

The 45th most marginal has 16,000 non-voters as well, more than the entire Labour vote and only 4000 short of the entire Tory vote.

You're right that one converted non-voter isn't as valuable as one converted Tory voter, but there's no obvious reason why any of the other candidates would be attracting many of those.

So Cuadrado cost Chelsea £10.4m per year on FFP books, whilst Pogba will be around £25m - £30m per year, depening on wage demands. If I understand [this resource](http://weaintgotnohistory.sbnation.com/2014/10/16/6968855/chelsea-ffp-database) correctly, Chelsea currently spend £164m per year on FFP. The highest we've ever recorded was £172m in the 2012/13 season. A swap deal would take our FFP budget upwards of £179m per year.

Ah right so you recognise that the experience of womanhood is different for white women as it is for black women and working class women face challenges middle class women do not and black working class women are entirely different. 

Why can't the same be said for black men, working class men, middle class men etc? Intersectionality was a recognition that feminism only focused on white middle class women (as in Betty friedman) abd an attempt to specifically address and engage women in different circumstances.

Toiletries, pet food, and baby supplies are also available.

Items may also be provided for community groups who are fulfilling the same ethos as a local Foodbank when supplies are available beyond the demand for boxes or are unsuitable for that purpose. All food is weighed in and weighed out, properly audited and checked for dates and quality. Please do not donate opened packages or home-made items as we have no way of knowing that they are safe for consumption, medicines or alcohol.

Some Foodbanks are equipped to distribute bread and fresh produce too. You may see collection points in your local supermarkets, in some offices and workplaces and churches. Sometimes a list of specific items is posted as guidance.

I am not an authorised representative of the Trussel Trust or any Foodbank so I don't think it is appropriate for me to make any specific statements about Foodbank needs or practices as these are down to the local organisation according to local practicalities.

First thing to do is money saving expert, read their guides *thoroughly* and use all the comparison websites you can find. Then go to the websites of those not on the ""all of market"" offers. Finally, take the seemingly best offers, come back to your brokers with them, and ask them to explain why one is better than another. They should be able to set you right. 

For instance, my first mortgage I had a broker and I looked online. He have me his best offer on our second meeting and I countered with one I found online that seemed better. He agreed it was a better deal than he could offer me as it was HSBC (well, first direct, but whatever).

Conversely, the mortgage I got on the place I'm at now, I did the same exact thing (different broker) and he explained how while I would get lower monthly costs on the other mortgage, the exit fees more than make up the difference. With my current product, I'm spreading the exit fees across the term - in essence I'm paying a little less for the whole package *and no exit surprises*, even though I've got higher monthly payments. And, like a few hundred pounds less if you sum it all up at the end of the term.

At the end of all that, you need to think what you want from your life - lower monthlies is great for the duration of your term and there may be things you could invest your money in that cover up the difference - that would mean that rather than paying more monthly, you're investing the difference for more return.

I hope I've made it clear, but please don't hesitate to ask if I failed. 

And feel free to correct me on any point - I'm no expert.

A similar thing happens in Scotland: Austerity is not the biggest issue for SNP voters (it's Scottish independence, funnily enough).

We want to protect the drug abuser from causing himself harm but in doing so increase the risks of harms elsewhere.

That's aside from personal sovereignty, where I agree with John Stuart Mill:
*That principle is, that the sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection. That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilised community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so, because it will make him happier, because, in the opinions of others, to do so would be wise, or even right. These are good reasons for remonstrating with him, or reasoning with him, or persuading him, or entreating him, but not for compelling him, or visiting him with[Pg 18] any evil in case he do otherwise. To justify that, the conduct from which it is desired to deter him must be calculated to produce evil to some one else. The only part of the conduct of any one, for which he is amenable to society, is that which concerns others. In the part which merely concerns himself, his independence is, of right, absolute.

And with it being an ex-military and largely working class town, we donr exactly have the most cosmopolitan, modern population. A lot of racial tension is here between us and the Nepalese.

So they recently opened a temple, as many of them ar buddhist. They opened this right next to the football ground, no less, a hub of shit for brained dipshits in our town. So a looot of hate is going on at the moment over it.

An you know ehat the sadly funniest thing is? The comments like ""I bet they build bombs in there"" or ""lets just bring over all the terrorists.""

People mistake them for muslims. And not that muslims would deserve that, by no means, but it just goes to show the fucking shit brained ignorance that infests this town.

I love the buddhists here. They actually use the parks. They meditate there, I think its so cool. The women often dress in their traditional garb and I think it looks beautiful. And they actually have a sense of community betweem them.

null,null,namtabmai,UnionFlag,2007 Honda CBR125,null,"First and foremost, thanks for your detailed reply. Lots of great points, all stuff I should keep in mind.

I should possible have mentioned I've been driving for 15 years give or take so I'm used to the fact these country roads frequently have people doing 60+. Not just the speeding either, locals cutting corners, plowing through give ways, etc. I drove past 3 road side tributes ( flowers etc ) today and it's a reminder that these sorts of roads unfortunately have the highest fatal rate for accidents. :( I realise riding gives a different perspective but the years of driving is something that helps my not be so bothered by the traffic.

That said, I'm not bothered by going slowly just looking at how I can improve. As I said I try and give way where possible, leave plenty of extra time for the journey and I'll stop for a ""breather"" when I feel the need. It makes the commute manageable and relatively stress free. So far I've been pleasantly surprised as I've had 0 issues with aggressive or careless drivers, a nice surprise that I hopefully haven't jinxed :)

The tyres are Michelin Pilots, which is nice to know they are recommended. I am looking about for a place to do give the bike a service, also skimming through the Haynes manual and YouTube trying to familiarise myself with how to check these things. Need to pick up a paddack stand so I can check things like the bearings and alignment myself.

I think cornering is one of my biggest issues for me at the moment. I know I'm pretty wooden and need to trust myself to lean in more. When I do manage to do that, even a little, it feels better and accelerating out of the corner feels great. I'll poke around Youtube, but I think I'll avoid trying stuff like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OOpE7fBw28) for the moment :)

And your absolutely right about me needing more experience. I'll riding weekends/evenings to clock up the miles and experience, and keep up with the commute unless it does become stressful.

I've got a couple of DAS lessons booked this weekend, which in hindsight seems a little premature, but I'm going to stick with it as any riding is good experience and riding with an instructor will be better yet.

3) If you've more practice time then practice turning so slowly to the point that the bike feels like it is going to tip and then at that exact point practice speeding up (close the clutch and put on some revs) rather than putting your foot down.

&gt;  They wouldn't rather pay compensation, they have to. You can't have it both ways.

You've clearly misunderstood my point.  They'd rather not pay at all but some cynics think it's cheaper to pay compensation rather than pay to fix a broken service.  People who take the NHS have legitimate cases because management knew that there was unsafe practices/low quality patient care going on because it's cheaper to pay for the odd compensation than pay to fix/improve the service and hospitals are insured/covered for certain errors.  For example, hiring an additional 10 nurses is a financial commitment of at least £250,000 annually.  A single MRI machine will set a hospital back about £1 million plus they'd need trained staff to operate it.  One of the main problems facing the NHS is the lack of staff and staff wages takes up the majority of NHS budget.  I'm not saying it's a smart idea, I'm saying that's the kind of thing that happens, especially when people could use it as an example of governments deliberately making the NHS look bad and crippling it in order to pave the way for justification of privatising the NHS.  The powers that be want the NHS to improve services but with less funding and there's financial penalties for hospitals that fail to meet government set (i.e. not set by regulatory bodies like the GMC) targets.",null,0,null,1440016693,null,null,false,0,cu8p2rk,null,t3_3hk8nl,null,null,null,t1_cu8itmr,null,null,null,1441350469,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Does anyone actually think the system has at any point been just right? I'm fairly sure there are plenty of people with different issues with the system. And we are now as a country spending more than at any point in history on the various benefits and social programs that we run, but those same systems have an even faster growing demand on them. 

So, what do you suggest? Raise taxes? Reduce inefficiency? Reduce fraudulent claims? It's not like the tories (or labour before them) are making changes for fun, they're making changes because changes are needed to keep the system going and avoid putting taxes up.

&gt; They are closing job centres and moving a lot of the process online. 

Is that bad?

&gt; this new system seems to have ridiculous expectations

Like turning up to appointments and looking for jobs? The thing is, from /u/Fuck_the_DWP's perspective, the system is fucked and stacked against him. From the perspective of the DWP worker, that story is probably one of a dozen they heard - just that day - about why the appointment was missed. 

There are always going to be people with genuine reasons for missing appointments and sometimes they'll be sanctioned incorrectly - that's inevitable, with a system that is designed to prevent people fraudulently claiming. I don't think it's OK, but I also don't think it's OK to pay jobseekers to everyone regardless of whether they make the effort to look for work, so there's a tradeoff. 

Was this unfair? Was this wrong? Sure, sounds like it from this side of the story. Does it mean the system's fucked and the people running it are bogeymen out to get the poor?

The accused is completely demented. When he turned up at court he had no idea where he was, was laughing and talking gibberish.

He is too demented to give any evidence more complicated than his own name.

He is too demented to receive any kind of punishment (this point has been admitted by the prosecution). Not even a transfer to a secure hospital would be appropriate, as he's so demented that he cannot pose a risk.

The only option left is to have a ""trial of the facts"" which is essentially an inquiry, which will report on the evidence and facts of the allegations. As Janner can't contribute meaningfully to this, and the outcome can have no effect on him, dragging him to court serves no purpose other than to spend taxpayers money and police time on a public spectacle.

While I would always wish to see justice done, especially in allegations so serious, in this case it is abundantly clear that justice cannot be done due to the accused's ill health.

If you do absolutely nothing at all you get the periodic tenancy you want. 

As to the contractual situation - I'm guessing your current agreement doesn't mention anything about a periodic tenancy arising? In which case it ceases to exist and a new tenancy appears by magic (i.e. the law says it does) on substantially the same terms as the one that just ended. You don't need to enter into a full new contract for them to raise the rent, don't let them use that as an excuse to tie you in. The following is sufficient *in writing*:

""I confirm I agree to the proposal to raise the rent to £[X] per month effective from [date]. I [authorise you to adjust the direct debit]/[have adjusted the standing order] payment accordingly. No other terms are affected.""

I was trying to provide alternate examples. It would be redundant to use the same example. Not to mention, shoplifting some chicken is hardly a major crime.

&gt;Call me old fashioned but isn't it illegal

Yes, and so weed, underage drinking etc. Even downloading a film is illegal. Guess what, loads of people do it anyway. Is that what you base your morals on, what's legal and what isn't?

&gt;I can guarantee that if my old mum had caught me shoplifting she would have punished me for it. Why? Because there are real consequences and she didn't raise a thief.

Because kids never stole shit decades ago when parents were allowed and encouraged to be strict. There was no crime, everyone lived happily. Perhaps your single example of your own childhood doesn't mean much.

&gt;you're acting like it's a civil rights issue

No, you keep bringing that up. I'm talking about understanding why your kid felt they would do that. It's nothing to do with rights or such. It's about understanding what they do and what drives them.

How have you nipped it in the bud exactly? You might as well suggest hitting them if your argument is that punishment is the way to teach a lesson to a child.

Cook 100g spaghetti and top it with a couple of spoonfuls of pasta sauce and your meal costs 10p tops. No freezer needed, and the pasta sauce *says* you need to eat it within three days but really it'll last a week in the fridge fine. Long grain rice is 40p a kg, oats are 75p a kg, so those two staples are about 25% cheaper than other supermarkets too.

On the other hand, one shouldn't make a habit of it. There's always an accumulated effect of those ""over"" periods. 

You have to consider what happens at those too fast revs. The engine is overheating. It's not being lubricated enough. The stresses and forces are becoming more and more. If you keep operating at those revs, you will be damaging the engine. That's why you don't want to be at those operating conditions for extended periods of time, for higher and higher revs.

For low ""redline"" revs, for short periods of time, it's OK. If your redline is at 9K, if your max is at 14k, if you hit 10.5k for 1.5 sec during a gear change, you're OK. Nothing's damaged.

They actually have started to investigate people on long sanctions to find out if they're managing to survive in a way that's not in line with the rules, so they can criminalise or sanction them again!)

The problem being, they're not showing any common sense.  5 minutes late, when you come from miles away and rely on public transport? sanctioned.  There's many, many truly stupid sanction reasons scattered all over the web.

Seriously, no-one deserves this, and it sure as hell doesn't 'encourage people to find work', as IDS seems to think, it encourages people to engage in criminal behaviour so they don't starve and become homeless.

Our home game was a total crapfest against a newly promoted team. the disallowed goal shouldn't be a worry as their guy climbed the back of our defender. Our goal shouldn't of been one but our new striker also hit the post.  BR has yet to show he's willing to commit more to the attack, even with coutinho, Ibe and lallana on the field at the same time supporting Benteke, but until Sturridge gets back, what other striker or offensive support would you prefer on the field?

I'm looking for £750 + shipping for the full build without the monitor and £150 for the monitor. The monitor has a couple of stuck pixels (not dead pixels) you can see here http://imgur.com/a/hLFmj but you don't notice them unless you are looking for them.

Everything has been kept in good condition and I have regularly cleaned the computer.

I'm open to offers for individual parts, but I'm unlikely to accept unless I get decent offers for enough of them to justify taking it apart. I still have original boxes for all parts as far as I'm aware.

I'm based in Cambridge if you would like to collect to save on shipping.

I'm dumbfounded at how much the 'look where you want to turn' rule works, there's been times where I've been turning at an intersection, felt I wasn't turning enough and in a split second 'look where I want to go' has snapped into my head, I've focused on where I should be going and the bike has taken me there. 

I think a lot has to do with confidence. I felt the same when I first started to drive my car, I was shit scared every time I was doing 25+mph, came into a meeting situation or found myself in busy traffic with cars darting into the smallest (and stupidest, and pettiest) places, sometimes you just have to tell yourself ""I've got this, I'm in control"". Granted loss of control on a bike is more costly than that of a car (to yourself and your machine) but you're probably more likely to mess up if you're constantly panicking, fearing the worst or approaching things without confidence. 

That being said, always ride in a way that makes you feel comfortable. If you don't want to travel as fast as the traffic on the road then don't feel you need to. I stick to the speed limits like glue, because I'm not risking getting caught or messing up at a higher speed than I should have been going anyway. It annoys some impatient people behind me but I'm not risking myself so they can get to the next set of reds a few seconds earlier.  

Right now I'm worrying too much about the road surface, specifically the 'seams' that join two separate pieces of tarmac together. I'm worrying that if I'm on a long sweeping turn and I find myself riding on it, then the bike is just going to slide out from underneath me. I find that I'm trying to pick and choose what side to be on, which is hard if the seam is right in the center or is darting gradually from position 1 to 3 and back. I know there are more important things I should be focusing on ahead of me. I feel like I should trust the bike more, but as it's a light 125 with thinner tyres, my gut instinct is to avoid it at all costs. Can anyone tell me if I'm being too cautious?

People will tell you that you HAVE to start with the first episode of the 2005 series, but that isn't strictly true. Doing it that way requires a lot of watching to get completely caught up. The show is designed to have many different starting points throughout the years, usually when a new actor takes over the title role.

Option 1: You can start at S01E01 on Netflix, called ""Rose."" This is the beginning of the newest series, called ""New Who."" Christopher Eccleston plays the Doctor. It has kind of a soap opera in space feel to it. If you start here, you'll need to watch 8 years' worth of episodes to catch up to where the show is at now.

Option 2: You can start at S05E01, called ""The Eleventh Hour."" This is where Matt Smith takes over as the Doctor. It's a little more recent, done by a different production and writing team, and it has a fairy-tale kind of feel to it. If you start here you only need to watch 4 years' worth of episodes to catch up.

Option 3: Finally, you could just start at last years' episodes, with Peter Capaldi as the Doctor (S08E01, ""Deep Breath""). It has more of a dangerous adventure vibe. This way you can be completely caught up after 13 episodes and then go back and watch the rest if you're still interested. 

If you find yourself completely hooked and want to watch the Classic, pre-2005 stuff, post here again. Those of us who are Classic addicts would be happy to help you.

When you say you appealed, do you mean you got a mandatory reconsideration (where another decision maker looks at it) or did you appeal via the courts? The first step of appealing a sanction is doing the recon, and the second is by the courts (in that order). If you got a recon and it was upheld, fair enough, that happens, it's often wrong. But if it went through to appeal with the courts, a judge looked at it and still decided to uphold the sanction, with all due respect there's probably a little more to the story. If you haven't appealed to the courts and it's within the time limits set out (contact JSA to see if this is the case), consider doing so. The courts are typically more sympathetic. 

In any case, best of luck. I'd like to reiterate the advice provided thus far, contact your local council and ask about crisis welfare support. Contact DWP and request hardship. Yes it is repayable but it's better than nothing. Contact food banks and your local CAB to see if there's anywhere they can refer you. Well done for looking into this allotments thing and keep up looking for work if you can.

The problem for them is that as members of the Parliamentary Party they have to be led by a guy most of them wouldn't have voted for and in a way their own electorates are not the electorate that elected him. This is partly why parties have tended not to have pure open primaries and instead lean towards giving their Parliamentary Party a heavier weighting or outright control over selecting their leader.

 Never will understand why some people are so terrified of other people seeing parts of their body that 50% of the population have. Everyone knows what a cock looks like. Is yours so special that it has to be hidden from view? Or will it garner so much attention that you'll be overwhelmed?  

 Honestly, nobody is interested in staring at your dick. Nobody is going to be judging it. Nothing bad is going to happen if people  see it. (I'm guessing here. You're cock may be an occult artifact of great and terrible power.)

 Frankly, it annoys me that I have to put clothes on to answer the door so the pizza company/indian takeaway don't ban me. In the summer, I'd love to go for a nude walk around the park, but I have to wear clothes and sweat my arse off because people are so insecure that they can only conceive of nudity in a sexual context, and find sexuality threatening. Being compelled to cover my balls leads to such outrageous overheating that I'll be amazed if I can ever sire offspring. 

  I cook naked (yes, I even fry naked), and one of the first things I do when I get home is to take off all my clothes. Don't get me wrong - I like clothes, especially in winter, and enjoy dressing up in fun colours and designs, but I resent being obliged to wear clothes in situations where they only present a hindrance and serve no functional purpose. Out of principle I wouldn't go to a sauna where I had to be clothed.

Regarding the seams etc. You got to be relaxed on the bike. If you are gripping it too tightly, that's how you will feel. Even if the bike does stupid things beneath you, if you are relaxed and your arms are not tightly holding it, you will hold your balance, and you will guide the bike perfectly fine. The bike is trying to keep straight. The gyroscopic forces on the wheels are trying to keep the bike straight too. If you give it the hint, everything will be OK but you have to give it just the right amount of push gently and not over-steer, and that's the most easily done when you are relaxed on the bike. And once you are relaxed, not gripping it, the bike will be steady, and you will be calm, and you will be feeling more relaxed, a self-fullfilling feedback cycle.

null,null,throwawhatthefudge,null,null,null,"A few years ago I actually used to work for the Dwp. I was the guy you used to go see once a fortnight to sign on.

Anyway, I had a regular bunch of folk who used to come in to sign on (it was 2009/ 2010 and jobs were thin on the ground). About 80% were people who had fallen on hard times and were doing their best to find work. I had been unemployed previously to finding work at the Dwp and felt for them since I had been in their shoes.

I would go through their job searches with them, help them claim additional assistance and everything else I could to help. I would give them my personal desk phone number and told them that they could call me anytime I was in if they were having a problem.  They all appreciated the help I could offer and I even received Christmas cards from them as thanks for the help, even if they had already found work.

So, their were two instances where I would say I went beyond what I could do and strayed into what the regulations said I should never do, but I did anyway.

The first was a guy called A. He was a single father and would often bring his child to appointments. He was an honest guy and tried his very best to provide for his child and was very diligent in his search for work. Anyway, he was due in for his signing on, but hadn't shown up. I made a point to leave all missed appointments to the very end of my day before listing them as missed so at least they could get a chance to make it later if something had come up. So it's 10 minutes before the day is over and he frantically came into the job centre and I saw him right away before he went to the front desk to check in. I immediately got up and waved him over before the guy at the front desk was able to say anything. I told him to take a seat and I'd see him right away. Turned out his child had gone into hospital and he had forgotten about coming in to sign on. I had his paper work out and was quickly looking over his job search and had his payment of benefits processed within 5 minutes. He was obviously shaken up by the days events and I could see tears in his eyes as I handed back his appointment book and gave him a smile and a wink and sent him on his way. In the event someone is late for an appointment we were supposed to inform the central office and they would decide what to do with the late appointment which would always result in payment being delayed. Basically, I could have got fired or worse, but I knew it was the RIGHT thing to do.

The second instance was a woman named B. She was a slightly older lady who worked hard to get back into work  and would always come to me for advice on whatever she was going through. She had actually telephoned me in a panic saying that she wasn't able to make it in at all to sign on due to family problems. I can't exactly remember the details, but a close family member had suddenly died. I could hear the sadness in her voice as she had suffered this terrible loss, but would also have her benefits delayed by not being able to make it. I actually then went and processed her payment and told her to please come in the next day to finish the rest of the meeting. She did and officially it looked like nothing bad had happened and even though she was going through hard times, came in the next day with a thank you card for me. I remember crying in the toilet after it since I was so touched.

Anyway, if there is a point to this post, it's that many of the staff at the Dwp are human and I wish I had been the person you were to see that day OP and you wouldn't have been in the awful situation you are in now.

The question is, and always has been, not whether 9 million people cause increased demand on services (they clearly will) but will the increased tax revenue from them people be enough to meet the increased demand.  There are other genuine concerns over timescales and the 'inertia' involved with building more houses and schools which brings to question the *rate* of immigration rather than the absolute levels of immigration.  Thankfully these things can both be quantified.

Now whether you like it or not, them 9 million are here and there are more coming.  I will say upfront now that given the figures I have seen for the whole country, and not just my own person experience, I do not believe there to be an immigration problem in this country.  Secondly, I think this is *precisely* the sort of issue that should not be left for the public to decide.

null,null,crimsonBZD,null,null,null,"My issue with a female doctor comes entirely from a storytelling standpoint. Not a problem with it being cannon in any way mind you, but from actual storytelling.

At least in nu who, the Doctor and his companions have always had some sort of sexual tension between one another. With Rose, it was obvious they were in love, yet they didn't express that in the terms of the show (at least up until tentoo.) With Martha, she loved him, and he never noticed her, being too tied up with Rose still. With Donna, I don't think the Doctor was ever interested, but she sure was.

This works, and is believable as a backstory, because it fits in within a standard structure we see out in the world - strong male, dependent/naive female.

Now, to be clear, what I'm saying is this doesn't need explaining from a story standpoint. It's easy to fit into the viewers mind.

Flip that script though, and we either have a Strong Female Doctor (which is fine, wouldn't need much explaining, still the doctor) and a young, naive female companion? The sexual tension won't really be there unless they go on to explain, or hint, that the Doctor or his companion are suddenly lesbian, which I don't think would fit in with the purpose of the show. A young, naive male companion? Either he's going to be acting like a bitch all the time, or something will have to sit there to explain to us why this person acts the way he does.

If we had some meek, young female Doctor - well that wouldn't make sense. He, or she, would still be the doctor with some 2000+ years of life in this universe.

We have a conferred devolution model where a bunch of select areas of government have been devolved to the Senedd with the rest remaining at Westminster. Compare that to Scotland where it's the opposite way around, there's a bunch of select areas of government which Westminster has control over, with the rest devolved to the Scottish Government.

So the people of Scotland *have to care* about what happens in it's parliament because that's pretty much where all the day-to-day running of the country happens. They have a simple devolution settlement, it's relatively easy to see who has control over what. But here, things are needlessly complex which leads people to think that the Senedd has powers over things it doesn't, and Westminster has control over thing which have been devolved.

I'd hope that once the Assembly transferred to a similar model to Scotland people would begin to care more about what happens inside, but if the UK government's idea of Welsh devolution looks like it does in the St David's Day Announcement paper then we'll be left with something that's even more complicated then what we currently have now.

The Conference can be wildly unpredictable, so it'd be an outrageous guess. Before the season I would but FGR as champions, and I'd still say so, but they didn't exactly look amazing at our place. The rest, I wouldn't even like to put myself out there at this stage of the season, especially as I haven't seen many teams play (a side effect of them never being on TV).

&gt; What’s the style of play? Do managers go out with a formation and play tactically? Or is it more relaxed?

Yes they most certainly do. The styles of play are as varied as they are at any other level, some teams get it on the ground and play football, some hoof long balls and kick everyone into the ground, and everything in between. A lot of the players/managers have lots of Football League experience, they know their football (our manager has an FA Cup runners up medal).

&gt; What draws people to these football games? Is it because they’re fed up of all the money and politics that run the Premier League, UEFA Champions League and such competitions? Or is it more to do with - for example - your dad used to take you to a Lincoln City football match and you enjoyed that experience, you’ve supported them ever since? 

Depends on the person? Some people have supported them all their lives, it's their local town. Some people used to support a bigger club but got disillusioned. There's as many reasons as there are fans.

&gt; Would you say there’s more of a personal relationship with the club and the players than there is with say, Chelsea fans and their players?

Definitely.

While I do think that the win away at Stoke was a quality result, as I have them pegged to do pretty well this year and the Britannia always seems to be a tough place to play, we unfortunately followed that up with a woefully unimpressive display at home against a newly promoted side. It's not to say Bournemouth are bad and they certainly played us tough but in all likelihood that side is going to be fighting to avoid the drop or at least in the bottom third of the table. If we are the team we seem to believe we are - one challenging for a Champions League spot - then games against teams like Bournemouth, at home should be comfortable affairs and over the course of the 90 minutes everyone who watches should come away thinking that we were the better side. Unfortunately that wasn't the case and I think we're right to ask questions and hopefully the management and the team are expecting to perform significantly better next week because if we put in a similar shift we're going to get eaten alive by an Arsenal team that - while not firing on all cylinders yet either - looked the part of a title challenger in their second week out and we all know has the talent to perform at an incredibly high level.",null,0,null,1440021955,null,null,1440080240,0,cu8smj8,null,t3_3hlh3k,null,null,null,t3_3hlh3k,null,null,null,1441352205,null,2,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null

There's nothing wrong with saying that assault is assault, and that it's wrong.

The problem with British schools (when I was there, at least) was that the staff were happy to ignore assault just as they were happy to ignore bullying. Or, at least, they handled them badly. 

I really like the ""three criteria"" assessment of bullying:

1. Bullying is aggressive behavior that involves unwanted, negative actions (e.g. taunting, abuse, hitting).
2. Bullying involves a pattern of behavior repeated over time.
3. Bullying involves an imbalance of power or strength (e.g. the bully is more popular or physically bigger).

I think this is the definition of bulling which has started to be used in US schools - I'm not sure if it's recognised over here.

Under this definition, the behaviour has to meet *all three* criteria to meet the definition of ""bullying"".

This definition recognises that kids sometimes handle disputes the wrong way, and learning to deal with interpersonal conflict is part of growing up.

You are not a bad person because you do something bad once, but kids have to be taught that it's wrong to harm others and that there will be consequences for their actions. But, under this definition, bullying is always part of an ongoing pattern.

IMO this allows bad behaviour and isolated incident of conflicts to be dealt with without drama or excess, but calls for serious escalation if bullying is identified.

The problem with taking this approach is it requires observant teachers and support staff and it recognises that more than detention or a bit of suspension is called for - if it's not expensive to teach troubled kids to behave better, then at least it requires a [whole shift of attitudes](https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/3hkjbo/english_children_among_the_unhappiest_in_the/cu8bwx5).",null,0,null,1440022172,null,null,1440022370,0,cu8srcv,null,t3_3hkjbo,null,null,null,t1_cu8czk6,null,null,null,1441352269,null,3,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

It's *impossible* to write enough regulations to ensure that the maximum income in a company is a fixed multiple of the minimum without negative repercussions.

Take for example scenario 2 that I outlined in a post above. *How* would you regulate to ensure that a company wouldn't simply move it's higher paying jobs abroad to get around the rule? We're in the EU and EU regulations allow companies to have multiple offices and indeed domicile for corporation tax wherever they want.

We could come out of the EU - but would not solve the multinational aspect. If we banned multi-nationals, then we'd have to close down Honda and Nissan and Ford and make all their employees redundant (and those are some of the few manufacturing jobs in Britain).

It is **utter idiocy** to believe that you can have some magic regulations that will get around all this.

I can just see Corbyn being interviewed and his voice rising shrilly (as it always does when he's under pressure), trying to explain that no jobs will be lost, it will all be saved by *magic regulations* of which he has *no idea* of the detail because none exist!

People will say, we're not going to elect this half-wit.

I get Corbyn is a thicko - if he believes in giving people water as a substitute for medicine, it's possible he believes that he can construct magic regulations that get around every single trade treaty we have without hurting the economy.

But why is someone like you buying into this? Do you really believe that magic exists? Do you believe that all the failures of the planned economies of the Soviet Union et all are just propaganda? That you can just say ""I believe"" and it will happen?

There are drugs that people can lose control on PCP, salvia (although it's short lived) and obviously alcohol. People do these drugs regardless of prohibition in huge numbers. The only thing that legalisation would bring is a greater control over the production and sale of them. Of course we would also gain the advantage of large tax revenues for dealing with people who have problems, as well as taking away the revenue streams for organised criminals. 

Aside from that your example doesn't work, masterbating at home is more akin to taking drugs. What you do to your own body is your business. Wanking in the corner shop no longer becomes a personal matter and the police should become involved. The same should be applied to drug use, if your drug use affects others the police become involved. It's exactly how we treat alcohol at the moment.

They just don't care because what is happening to OP is ""other people"" and what matters to them is ""being pure"" even if it means Labour is in permanent opposition.

A few of us finally threw our hands up in despair and set out to create somewhere we could talk about politics without every other thread descending into a debate on the impending genocide of the white race, etc. It developed into something quite pleasant fairly quickly, and grew some way beyond that original goal.

Starting a few months ago, they've taken significant pains to clean things up considerably over in the other place- so the original reason for this subreddit's existence is a fair bit less relevant than it was. Very much to their credit that the sort of thing that crops up on /r/badukpolitics nowadays is now more of a rarity than a regular feature of discussion- particularly with the size of the place.

*Now*, /r/BritishPolitics exists as a more heavily moderated community than the other place. We've a somewhat independent community, and a decently active IRC channel- the moderation philosophy of this subreddit's shifted towards maintaining it as a pleasant community where people come to *enjoy* talking about politics in a civil, welcoming manner. We vet every single comment and post manually, to make sure that things stay constructive- a benefit of our relatively small size. That, generally, means that we can intervene and try and stop things descending into flame wars- keeping the standard of discussion at least civil results in a more satisfying, constructive, educational experience than you find in /r/ukpolitics when controversial topics crop up. 

It's less hyperactive than /r/ukpolitics nowadays, but I think it serves a useful purpose- and we'll continue running the place as long as that's the case.

null,null,ThePoeticMotion,null,null,null,"Daniel Sturridge is set to return to Merseyside from the United States tomorrow, having successfully completed a three-month rehabilitation programme after hip surgery.

Before his return, the forward, who made only 18 appearances for Liverpool last season, will be assessed by Glen Driscoll and Chris Morgan, the club’s heads of performance and physiotherapy respectively, who have travelled to Boston to check on his recovery.
Sturridge is understood to be targeting a return to first-team action against Manchester United on September 12.

It was in a fixture against United in March that he first suffered the injury and, although he started an FA Cup tie away to Blackburn Rovers the next month, the severity of the problem was such that he was operated on in New York in May.

Since then, Sturridge has been working with the medical department of the Boston Red Sox baseball club, who are also in the hands of Fenway Sports Group (FSG), Liverpool’s ownership group, and the England striker’s progress has been sufficient for him to return to his club in preparation for his long-awaited comeback.

Liverpool’s immediate priority is to ensure that Jordan Henderson, their captain, is available for their visit to Arsenal in the Barclays Premier League on Monday night as the midfield player struggles to overcome a foot injury that has affected him for the past ten days.
Henderson underwent a scan on Tuesday to ascertain the extent of the problem and, although the injury is not serious, the 25-year-old remains a doubt for the Arsenal game despite Liverpool’s willingness to give him every opportunity to prove his fitness.
Brendan Rodgers is satisfied by Liverpool’s start to the season, which has seen them take maximum points from their first two fixtures, games in which they also kept clean sheets, and he has praised the impact made by the five new signings who featured in Monday night’s 1-0 win over Bournemouth.

“I thought they did well,” the Liverpool manager said. “I thought James Milner was outstanding, Nathaniel Clyne you can see is such a good defender and wants to get forward and the young boy, Joe Gomez, at 18 years of age this is a big step up for him, but he’s coping very well.

“Christian Benteke will be disappointed he didn’t get two goals, but he got off the mark and his all-round play was excellent.

No; but it’s been better at times and worse at times.

&gt; There are always going to be people with genuine reasons for missing appointments and sometimes they'll be sanctioned incorrectly - that's inevitable, with a system that is designed to prevent people fraudulently claiming. I don't think it's OK, but I also don't think it's OK to pay jobseekers to everyone regardless of whether they make the effort to look for work, so there's a tradeoff.

One of the main things the system is supposed to provide is a safety net — so that however low people fall, they have a chance to get back on their feet.  So that they don’t end up in the kind of vicious circle where their poverty makes it very difficult for them to find work, no matter how hard they try.  And if that means paying *something* to people even when they’re fucking up, no matter how hard they try?  Yes, I’m OK with that; I think it’s worth it.  Both for their welfare, and also from the point of view of the rest of society — fewer people end up in circumstances that drive them to crime, begging, and so on.

If large portions of society were deliberately and comfortably living on the dole, and others were suffering economically because of it — then, yes, that would be too much “something for nothing”.  But we’re nowhere *near* that situation at the moment.  If a small proportion of the population are getting something for nothing, and it’s keeping them from starvation or homelessness, that really doesn’t seem like a bad thing to me.

&gt; Does it mean the system's fucked and the people running it are bogeymen out to get the poor? Of course not.

I’d agree, I don’t think the people in charge are deliberately out to get the poor.  But they are being pretty callous about the suffering it causes directly among the poor, and also very short-sighted about the long-term effects on society.",null,0,null,1440023186,null,null,1440023392,0,cu8tdoh,null,t3_3hk8r5,null,null,null,t1_cu8pngv,null,null,null,1441352561,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Liverpool doesn't have the financial muscles of the top 4. We have to develop. Look what BR done to Suarez, Sturridge and Sterling. Look what he is doing to Coutinho, Can and Ibe.

Coutinho, Can, Firmino and Benteke all came in late this year. Moreno was injuried in the summer. With some time and fitness building up, our attack will be more fluid.

anyways, he is about as solid as it gets in terms of defensive ability for us, he's a scouser, he's young, and has an unbelievable attitude. he would run through a brick wall for BR if he was asked and i have no doubts in my mind that regardless of his status (starter or squad player) he will play a huge role for us for years to come (granted he recovers). 

one last point, he is not a BR player in so many ways but his versatility will liken him to BR and his dependability will too. If you ever have any doubts about flanno, just recall some of suarez' quotes on him:

Remember how the Sycorax leader tried to stab Ten in the back after the alien was defeated in a swordfight and therefore had to leave Earth? That basically made Torchwood correct in firing on that ship.

How does this make sense? The Doctor tried to resolve the conflict in a way where the Sycorax left earth (more or less) peacefully. Harriet Jones essentially shot a retreating enemy in the back. An argument could be made that she was right to do this to protect Earth's secrecy, but Earth gets invaded almost every week, so it's safe to say the secret's out. Either way, The Doctor still comes off as the most noble character in the situation.

&gt;Diversity doesn't mean much and can't stand up to the idea that characters should be written well.

Ideally large funds would come into the market supplying purpose built large occupancy blocks of rented property - providing a much better option for the market.

He just happens to have adventures with female humans more often that male humans, and happens to have adventures with them that makes him like them, or shows that he needs them. Although if you actually look at it statistically, 2 in 3 companions are male. (Jack, Mickey, Rory, and Adam (I assumed 2 episodes as a main character made someone a companion) with Rose, Martha, Donna, Amy, and Clara and River). 


If you count the comics at least, then there is also Wolfgang Ryter,  a young boy, and Majenta Pryce, a green alien. They were companions of the 10th Doctor that appeared in several comic strips, in DWA and DWM respectively.


ARC, an alien creature, Decky Flamboon, a shapeshifter who normally looked like an alien, John Jones, a humanoid chameleon from the 1960s, and Kevin, a robotic T-Rex, were also all companions of the Eleventh Doctor, in either DWM or DWA.


The War Doctor also had a companion in the form of Cinder, a female Dalek fighter from Moldox. Although this breaks my rule of a character having at least two appearances, considering the War Doctor has, at the most, half a dozen appearances himself, it seems fair to allow Cinder to count.

Of course there is a balance, someone who is blatantly abusing the system should be kicked off it, but the balance should be tilted towards letting fraudulent people abuse the system rather than punishing legitimate people.  Missing an appointment is a very poor metric for this, and the punishment for it is very ridiculous.

I'm partially asking because it is a while away in the future but I'd be tempted to work in Cardiff and Swansea for a short space of time and if there is massive encouragement for Docs to come over to A&amp;E and the likes it could be easily doable for sure.

rail:
Yeah it is an annoyance across the UK. the WML and other main lines get the work but it is the services between the towns / cities that are really in need of it.
As you mentioned clearly one line for Wales isn't exactly great. I mean right down the South too so yeah, not the best. No linking to communities as you said although I guess you start off with the busiest lines and then hope as time goes on the rest of Wales isn't neglected.

Unis:

Interesting - I did note that PC did encourage STEM students ( or wanted too anyway) to stay at Welsh uni's. I think it is important long term not just to get your students to bugger off to England for their uni, it adds so much to the economy and communities.

The first and last is pretty much expected based on recent league performances. Gerrard even said that he is the best he has worked with, and felt it was a pity he didn't come in earlier. I don't think there is any available managers, maybe Klopp is an exception, that can actually do a better job at BR at the moment.

The 3 seasons before we were essentially being run into administration and were falling apart. A change in owners to stop us getting liquidated as well as cycling through managers and selling all our best players and buying players like Konchesky and Poulsen. Since then Rodgers has had 300 million spent on a squad and we're averaging finishing 1 or 2 places above where we were before when we had no money and an appalling squad. Plenty of managers could do better than that. 

To go along with Gerrard praising him etc you have players like Agger, Sakho, Lucas, Borini who all have issues with him. 

&gt; Liverpool doesn't have the financial muscles of the top 4.

We don't quite, but we have spent nearly the same amount as all of them in the time he's been in charge, and we've finished below Tottenham (who spend significantly less than us) in 2 of his seasons in charge. 

&gt; We actually have a really strong squad this year, and we actually have to leave out players from the bench that played regularely in the 1st team last season.

&gt; Coutinho, Can, Firmino and Benteke all came in late this year. Moreno was injuried in the summer. 

This exactly what people though of our signings last year, and they worked out horribly. It's way too soon to hop on the it will get better with time narrative. It could go better, but it's naive to not think we still could have a shite year.

null,null,elmo298,null,null,null,"&gt; The Corbyn phenomenon is a movement that nobody predicted or got up behind the scenes. With its echoes of the Scottish referendum campaign and European leftwing populist movements, it’s a backlash against grotesquely narrowed political choices and a punitive austerity imposed to pay the costs of the 2008 crash.

This is one of the things I honestly believe is behind this surge. People were satisfied, even with New Labour, that public services (through varying degrees of success) would be protected. Now for 'left' Ed to come in and say he was 'the first labour leader to say he'll cut public services' did two things:

1) Drove members away

2) With Corbyn elected, began the wrath of a disillusioned left who feel that the break from austerity and cuts offered by Westminster is needed.

Now we can all argue which way is the best for Labour to continue, but New Labour died when the system turned to 1 member 1 vote. People now have a bigger say and the change has allowed people to (for good or bad is personal opinion) enter the game and strive for a change in Labour - one that needs to evolve from the New Labour years. No wonder people feel poorly about Labour when a Conservative government is able to introduce a 'living wage' higher than one of Eds flagship policies offered. Yes it is a ploy, but the fact that they could do it so easily was a brilliant piece of political gaming, in my opinion highlighting that Labour needs to change and offer a *real* alternative.

It was in a fairly bad bit of my town, had a lot of low-income families with children there and the school was often forced to act as a dumping ground for pupils who'd often been expelled from 'better' schools. Just in my first year there alone, I was attacked in a gym changing room and beaten pretty badly, had various things including my lunch stolen from me constantly, was followed home one night and was pelted with stones and bottles and then one kid actually attacked me in class. 

&gt;Schools tend to say things like ""zero tolerance"" in regards to bullying, but it is rarely enforced. Not once were any of my bullies punished for what they did.

This was certainly the case for me. My family ended up getting involved with the school heads and a lot of stuff was said about being tough on bullying, but all I saw from my end of this was that the bullies, assuming they were even dealt with at all, merely got 'talked to' (which was useless) or on a rare occasion, put on yellow card reports (which basically meant teachers monitoring them in class and then writing down about their behaviour on a yellow card which was then read by the year head). Even the girls who beat me senseless in the changing room were, despite the fact I could have (and likely should have) had the police involved on assault charges, never properly dealt with. It was nigh on impossible, because of the previous expulsions of many pupils, to then expel them again. 

Eventually my school was taken over and with it, the rules changed. Suddenly kids who seemed untouchable were thrown out. Something like 93 people were permanently excluded and about 20 more were put into a new isolation unit. 

Sad thing is, it had an impact on me which still continues right up until today.

&gt;Incidentally, whataboutism has always seemed like a bullshit comeback to me. It makes zero fucking sense.

It makes perfect sense. It's used as a way to derail a discussion and take focus away from something that you aren't comfortable about. The discussion here is about a left wing candidate, the far left and it's sympathies/support of extremist islamism.

He is a time bomb like I said in that he'll make one of those mistakes at least every game or two and Lovren is the same. I meant time bomb in the sense is they go off randomly and damaging mistakes like your example.

Both of them are incredibly rash and prone to switching off. Usually if you have one player like that you match them with a calmer more assertive partner. Playing them together is asking for trouble.

Lets look at when they've both performed at their best. Skrtel had Agger for the longest period of time he's been here, and next to him looked pretty solid. Agger was far more calm and cancelled out Skrtel's tendency to be rash. 

Lovren was at his best at Southampton next to Fonte and behind Schneiderlin. Fonte was again the calming force next to him, and Schneiderlin covered for his rash forward challenges, and it actually worked for them as Lovren would be well covered and was capable of breaking up play early for them. 

I'd argue we should keep one of them, but not both and certainly don't play them together. Lovren might need a shield (as evidenced by his better performances with one in front of him for Southampton) which Rodgers seems to not want in his team, so it's probably better to keep Skrtel.",null,0,null,1440025544,null,null,1440026081,0,cu8us9c,null,t3_3hlh3k,null,null,null,t1_cu8uh55,null,null,null,1441353256,null,1,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

I found a few properties within my budget but they would always be snapped up before I could get down to Bristol so once I was finally able to secure a viewing I put an offer in for for the first property I visited.( which happened to be my favourite out of perhaps 5 or 6) My experience with the letting agency was quite positive (I used Sarah Kenny) but the rental price was a little more than what we wanted to pay. Having said that the agency fee wasn't too bad compared to some of the amounts I was charged whilst I was a student in Bristol.

Corbyn is clearly guilty of this- he has associated repeatedly with those who've 'turned out' (if you believe his press) to be anti semitic ideologues. 

The left should loath Islamists, but often seem willing to associated with them because they are 'oppressed' and therefore worthy of championing- see Ken Livingstone as well. Its pathetic and undermines our cause.

He'll allow Chelsea to break out of their prison of playing a low block. He may free up a fullback to join the attack, as opposed to Azpi having to hang back to protect Terry. He'll move the ball out of the back and help the attack.

And if we did upgrade it shouldn't be a DM and Dier, it should be Dembele getting upgraded (I think he's an excellent player just not a fit with our team).

But yes, flats specifically in Morningside, Tollcross and Fountainbridge will get snapped up as quickly as they appear. They are extremely popular areas of the city. Something half-way okay and not a complete cesspit like Gorgie, Longstone, parts of Leith, would be appropriate.

Having had to go through the nightmare of private rental flat-hunting on four separate occasions in this city, I can attest to the trials and tribulations involved. Apart from one occasion I got lucky and snapped up the first flat I was interested in, I had to treat it like a full time job. And I mean that literally.

You'll have to deal with arsewipe letting agents that keep listings for flats already let online on purpose, arsewipe agents that will ""get back to you"" (this is code for 'please never call us again'), arsewipe agents that know literally nothing about the flat they are showing and tell you ""call the office"" if you have anything resembling a serious question.

I hate to be the harbourer of doom and gloom, but you have absolutely zero chance of acquiring a well priced rental flat without being physically here for the searching process. It sounds extreme, but I might consider bagging the cheapest accommodation you can find for a week or two (wherever it may be), and investing a lot of time trawling through listings and harassing agents as much as you can, visiting as many properties as you can, and just generally doing as much due diligence as quickly as possible into any flats you might be interested in.

Strength? The UK is a world power no longer. Sure, we still have our nukes (mounted on the top of missiles leased from the Americans), but the regular army has been cut to the bone in recent years. The Royal Navy is a joke - the surface fleet is now reduced to just six destroyers and thirteen frigates (plus a bunch of minesweepers and patrol ships). Hard to see how we could pull off another Falklands. Sure, we'll have two aircraft carriers at some point in the distant future, but no planes to launch from them.

Global influence? What influence does being a part of the UK confer on Wales? We have no seats at the top tables - be they in the UN, NATO or the EU. Our representation within the EU parliament is *reduced* through being a part of the UK:

* Wales, with a population of 3.0 million, has 4 MEPs
* Lithuania, with a population of 2.9 million, has 11.
* Slovenia, with a population of 2.0, has 8.
* Malta, with a population of 0.5, has 6.

And additionally, Wales has no representation on the Council of Ministers - arguably the more important body when it comes to EU policy.

But perhaps you were talking about Britain's famed *soft power* - the BBC and all that. When was the last time a BBC program about Wales made waves internationally?

Economic safety? What has been safe about the last seven years? If it weren't for massive government intervention in 2008/09, the entire financial sector would have utterly imploded, and the economy with it. The recovery since then has been predicated primarily on another housing bubble, perpetuated by government policy, and the same dodgy lending that precipitated the crisis in the first place. We are far too overreliant on financial services for economic growth and we don't have the agility to rebalance our economy in the same way that fellow travellers like Ireland and Iceland have in recent years.

Of the four gospels Mark is thought to be the earliest to be written and the earliest known versions of Mark end before anybody actually witnesses his resurrection - just a second-hand report with one guy saying ""oh yeah, Jesus is still alive, go here and you'll find him"", but no mention of whether or not they do. The tales of people actually seeing a resurrected Jesus are present in later copies of the text but in a style that's sufficiently different scholars debate that it was authored by Mark at all or tacked on by someone else. The other gospels were written years later once the telephone game of storytelling has had a chance to embellish the tale. Likewise, the virgin birth only appears in two of the four gospels, and again, they're the ones that came along later.

The canonical bible was still being worked out hundreds of years AD, with books being added and removed, and the council of Nicea was in the 300s when they were still trying to agree what Jesus actually was in terms of whether he was created, born or always existed in some form - a pretty important detail.

* He's already one of the better centre-backs in the Prem at 21. He's arguably not far behind Cahill already, and should only get better. Everyone around him says he's destined for greatness

* I'm concerned that JT will leave in the next few years leaving us with a gap which we could have to pay even bigger bucks to fix. Stones after a year or two of stewardship under JT is an ideal replacement and means when Terry leaves we will already have bedded stable replacements between Stones, Cahill and Zouma

* He's English/homegrown and watching an Englishman thrive at Chelsea is always doubly enjoyable

* For £35m, I don't think its as much of a risk as people think. We'll either save money by buying him now rather than next year, and at the very worst he is still guaranteed to go for £25m+ to a tier 2 club even if he has a dodgy season. Perhaps thats an arrogant/wasteful attitude to have, but losing £10m on a player isn't that big a deal for a club like Chelsea. 

Sure, we could go for a foreign option, and probably get better value for money. The only players who I know are of equivalent potential are Varane (extremely expensive), Marquinhos (extremely expensive), Laporte (release clause + spanish tax would make him cost more than Stones), and Umtiti (perhaps a more sensible purchase, but no prem experience plus not homegrown)",null,0,null,1440029927,null,null,1440031235,0,cu8xayl,null,t3_3hm6ua,null,null,null,t3_3hm6ua,null,null,null,1441354443,null,6,null,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,6,null

null,null,ampason,null,null,null,"**Disclaimer:** not a lawyer at all, always check everything with the Citizens' Advice or a lawyer if you can, just offering my own understanding and experience of dealing with too many shitty landlords and tenants as an undergrad. Summary in bullets at the bottom.

Your contract should specify the details of how to pursue a deposit dispute. One of you - the Lead Tenant - normally has to be the one to do it. The first stage is notifying the agency within a reasonable period of time that you intend to raise a dispute; from there you can attempt to negotiate with them. If you can't come to an agreement the agency or landlord is happy with, usually within a month, then you can take the matter to arbitration.

Arbitration will be conducted by one of three independent bodies. Your agency **is required by law** to have registered your deposit with either the Deposit Protection Service (DPS), MyDeposits (your contract might refer to this as Capita Tenancy Deposit Service if it's old) or The Dispute Service (TDS). Whichever of these agencies it is will be the independent body that rules on your dispute; they are genuinely independent, and they won't assume the landlord left the property in the condition they claim it was without proof. This process doesn't cost you any money but it is slow, and there is always a risk that the landlord tries to seek more money for more stuff they claim to have discovered, but you could also end up at least getting more of your money back. Once the dispute is resolved, both parties have to accept it - if one refuses, legal action becomes an option.

The responsibility for cleaning the house is communally shared - as far as the landlord is concerned, they don't care who moved out when because you all signed a fixed-term tenancy, so you were all liable for the upkeep of that property until the last day of that tenancy. Your friend (or former friend) is absolutely unjustified in saying it was your responsibility as the last tenant to clean. They could have stayed in the house if they wanted to and chose not to - not your problem.

If you paid the deposit individually - that is, if you each signed an individual contract rather than a collective one - then although you have one representative as lead tenant, you should have your money returned to you each individually. This means there are three separate deposits at play, rather than one whole deposit for the whole house, even if they are protected as one. When it comes to making deductions the agency does not have to deduct equally - they can and should deduct proportionate to what you can demonstrate is the damage for each tenant, and you are also entitled to know exactly what they are claiming for. So if one tenant's room was a state but the other two were fine, then you two can reasonably say to the agency ""we accept the bill but we would like you to take into account that this particular room was left in this state by one tenant, not all of us, so we would like you to deduct us for only communal areas"". They're usually happy to try and accommodate this request because they know that if a dispute is raised, they have to prove they billed everyone fairly.

If the landlord is claiming from all of you in good faith (i.e., the claim is fair - billing two people for £25 when one forgot to clean a window and one destroyed their door with an axe would be bad faith) and you paid individual deposits, then the money should be deducted equally from each of you unless you make a challenge asking for an adjustment. The agency can't tell you they want to make a collective deduction; they have to tell you what they're taking from each individual, and the only *have* to negotiate with the Lead Tenant.

So essentially, if one tenant is objecting to them trying to bill you all equally, tough luck - they can either ask the Lead Tenant to raise a dispute or just accept the payment. If you all paid one big collective deposit and are all tenants of the house together as a group (rather than as individuals), then the deposit should be returned to the Lead Tenant to distribute between you all - if you're the Lead Tenant and you decide to divide it up equally, then really, that only leaves the other tenant the option of taking you to small claims court (which it probably won't be worth them doing unless you're deducting most of their deposit and they'd probably lose). So basically, when it comes to splitting the deposit up equally, your friend only really has a leg to stand on if s/he's the Lead Tenant - and only if you're in a collective tenancy.

In summary then, I think your options are:

* You can raise a dispute together and try to get all or more of your money back. Visit the website of the service your deposit is protected with to find out more about what that will involve. Try to negotiate with the agency or landlord if you can first. **You will need proof to back up any claim you make at arbitration, as will your landlord.**
* If one person did a lot more damage than another (you need substantive proof for communal areas, but you can make a strong claim if only one person really messed up their room), you can try to negotiate with the agency to have them dock more money from that person and less from the other two.
* If you decide to accept the fine and you just want the money split equally, the Lead Tenant can accept the deduction on the condition it is split equally between the tenants, assuming you have three individual tenancies.
* If you have a shared tenancy, then the Lead Tenant should get the full sum back to distribute between the tenants. Any tenants who have an issue with how it gets divided will have to take it up with the Lead Tenant, not the agency, and will have to pursue them if they want a bigger share of money back. If for whatever reason you have another agreement in place, then the Lead Tenant can still ask the landlord to split it up equally. The agency should oblige because as long as they pay the money back as required by law, it isn't really their problem how it gets split up if - from their point of view - the split was agreed with the Lead Tenant on behalf of the whole house.",null,0,null,1440031956,null,null,false,0,cu8ygg3,null,t3_3hn3b9,null,null,null,t3_3hn3b9,null,null,null,1441355017,null,3,null,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3,null

Another issue is that our relations with Islamic groups is really quite foggy. Take The Muslim Brotherhood for example who are a longstanding Islamic Party/debating society with many members worldwide and in our country - and then sooner or later Cameron is commissioning a report investigating whether they are extremists.

&gt; If Farage had been pictured with multiple skin head characters and had invited skinheads to the commons and even praised them for their contribution to the community it'd be the equivalent of what Corbyn has done.

But in all seriousness, having your husband teach your boy how to fight is never a bad idea, regardless of how 'civilised' we like to think we are. It will give him some self esteem at the very least. The point is that bullies don't go near tougher targets, they like the easy pickings. 

(The real trick is to teach him how to be devious and retaliate on the sly when no one is looking, the tougher trick is to teach him not to sell you out if he's caught!)

But I dunno how parenting is nowadays, I had 2 girls and I taught them both how to fight, the older one got into a fight when she was 7 and gained a reputation not to be fucked with, the younger one rode her big sister's reputation. They carried on through secondary school with little incident. 

You may find some of this distasteful (I'm feeling it a little as I'm typing it out) but going on my personal experiences at school you have to fight to retain your self-esteem, or you just end up feeling impotent and violated.

Likelihood is that he tried in vain to explain what happened. they were so tight for time that they told him to come back at another time; meanwhile the no-show was already logged, and the sanction process had already started. Although, it does seem strange that it would go straight to a 13-week, usually they stage them based on the number of 'offences'. Saying that, I got 13-weeks for being dismissed from a job, and I hadn't been sanctioned before.

What you're forgetting is that DWP 'advisors' are not only targeted on the positive aspects of unemployment (i.e. organising interviews for customers, signposting them to organisations that can help with employability skills, etc), but also the negative aspects (i.e. sanctions per week/month/year/whatever).

It literally is pot luck, and even though you may have solid gold proof - if they're under pressure from their management to sanction more people, they'll find the slightest reason.

No you can't. It's the same as the brit's story. If you miss an appointment, meeting, or don't fulfill SNAP's job seeking requirements they cancel benefits on you immediately.

Also, you only get SNAP for a few months; even if you've met all the requirements they still cancel your food stamps after 4ish months automatically. You can reapply and might get benefits again, but the process takes about a month. That's a month you don't get to eat without warning.

null,null,Iainfletcher,,Labour Member,null,"&gt; In part because new ideas are too easily dismissed as ""Tory-lite""; and in part because of a fear of being seen as too radical.

Examples? The closest thing to radical I've seen was Kinnock's ""cut the top rate of tax"" idea. Which is just bad (and right wing) economics.

The current buzzword seems to be ""devolution"" which isn't exactly radical and life changing and to be honest in many cases strikes me as less accountable and less efficient than a central government. It also on the face of it just suggests ""more of the same, but at a local level"".

People want things they can get excited by. If the Government aren't messing something up (like they were in the 80s and 90s with public services) it needs to be radical to catch people's interest. 

What I see from a lot on the right of the party at the moment is ""We'll get back in and put things back how they were in 2010"". But that's not what anyone wants. Cooper talking about Sure Start almost exclusively is a good example, I'm sure it's important and it's a nice program, but just opposing the cuts to something or promising it's reinstatement isn't enough. 

We have some massive challenges ahead of us, we are at inflection points in the debates around how we run the economy and particularly the financial sector, how we educate our children in an age of free information and fast changing technology, how we move people out of low skilled jobs that are likely to be automated, how we tackle climate change, drug policy, how we protect civil liberties and privacy in the digital age, our relationship with the EU.

We're in a period of change unseen since the industrial revolution and, on the whole, Labour has nothing to say about it.

If it was me: I'd lay this case out and back it up with plans for retraining support for all adults and massive infrastructure development. I'd make a big song and dance about how we're going to have free education for STEM subjects and shortage areas like nursing will get paid to train. We're going to train up British workers to take British jobs. I'd take a stance (any stance!) on what I'd want to see change in Europe rather than blindly back it whatever. I'd have a massive housebuilding program. I'd steal half of UKIPs playbook on democracy and champion PR, MP recall, some form of digital democracy, greater transparency from government. Make it all about how we're going to clean up politics.

There's lots of big issues that cut across voter groups that we can claim if we're bold enough. 

In 2015 our message was poor. It came across as random policy announcements with no cohesive message. A message of renewing Britain, from its skills, to its infrastructure, to its democracy would be enough to hang several popular policy ideas off IMO.",null,0,null,1440035198,null,null,false,0,cu90b0e,null,t3_3hknue,null,null,null,t1_cu8b7sl,null,null,null,1441355900,null,1,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,1,null

send in a small force (10,000ish) to spearhead the iraqi advance, retake the main population centres and GTFO. no dealing with guerilla campaigns, no long occupations, that's the Iraqi army's job, hopefully Mosul will prove a lesson and some actual experience will serve better than American training.

I grew up in Belfast - where street corners and parks are ordained with murals, plaques and symbols dedicated to  either the 'glorious' dead who either died for Irish Republicanism under the boot of the Colonial British, or died for Ulster and Freedom at the hands of the Terrorists. When we glorify the dead in this way, we encourage another generation to see the past as back and white, good and evil - or in our case -'themuns and us. This is done by groups intentionally to help perpetuate ideologies long past their social relevance, and encourages both communities to perceive their own victim hood as being the only valid one - and the 'other' as the oppressor. This can have a massive impact encouraging young kids to even perceive themselves as victims of violence that occurred long before they were born. 

Symbols, like the poppy can be used in this way. If you want to 'show appreciation' - thats great, but in doing this you are legitimising one side of a conflict over another. Even taking out the NI context - the British army have a murky history - a mix of colonial wars of oppression and wars of resources and power, although I would agree with you in their positive role in WW2. To pay respects to all soldiers, is in effect legitimizing one side - and encouraging a blind belief that 'our men' are the righteous ones who can do no wrong in fighting 'evil'.

Another stipulation is they only drug test if there is strong reason to believe the person has a substance abuse problem, which they determine using two methods. 1. They do a comprehensive background screening and try to find out, and 2. If the person confess to appointments obviously high. When or if they determine the person has a problem, they don't just take away their benefits, they get them help, including rehab, counseling, etc.

It's a deconstruction of the whole show, really.  And a rather savage one.  All the things the Doctor normally does to help work *against* him.  Trying to inspire people makes them paranoid.  Trying to communicate with the monster gets him trapped and almost killed.  Trying to save people ends with them turning on him.  The special person, the only one traveling alone, the one with the most immediate personal tragedy?  Yeah, the monster eats her first.  And then the other people, the ones who all have someone travelling with them, they all gang up with their partners and throw her, alive, out the airlock.

He doesn't end up doing any good whatsoever, and he very nearly gets deliberately murdered by the people he's trying to save.  He doesn't even solve the mystery - almost nothing about the monster is revealed.

Come to think of it, why *do* I love it so much? 

Well, there's Tennant's acting, which is fantastic.  Most especially when the monster has him frozen, even controlling what he *says*.  And somehow Tennant acts the *hell* out of it.  Absolutely harrowing.

Is that true? UKIP supports Britain having a controlled immigration system. Honestly, i think they could have done a better job explaining what that actually entails.

It means that we can tailor our system to suit our needs. Need more doctors/nurses this year? Need to cut overall numbers to preserve living standards? Need to raise numbers to meet rising labour demand?

We can do none of these things as members of the EU. We can't even plan ahead because don't know how many will come in any given year.

He may have strict ideas about what he wants in terms of discipline or whatever, but if that means jettisoning a bunch of actually useful (even if limited) players like Adebayor, Lennon and Capoue, then all it does is fuck us in the short term.

His man management skills were terrible in the way he played Eriksen, Kane and Mason into the ground until they had nothing left in the tank.  His refusal to rotate or even vaguely consider another tactical setup cost us 4th place more than any single other factor.

Maybe there will be some big long-term payoff to all of this, but I think the jury's out on a guy who didn't even last two seasons at Southampton.  It's not like he's a modern-day Wenger with a history of long tenures, so putting all our eggs in the Poch basket is a bit risky I honestly feel.

I mean, it's not like he had the starting XI he was using playing scintillating football last season anyway, aside from honestly about 4-5 games max.  Most of the time our play was staid, slow and defensively shambolic, which is no better than anything else we've had over the last few years.  Hell, Sherwood had us playing more enterprising football, and he got something out of Adebayor too.

So considering how good Capoue genuinely was for us nearly every time he started, and how badly we lacked even just basic rotation in the middle of the park last season, either Capoue must've done something fucking terrible that has somehow not leaked, or Poch just should've relaxed for a bit and used the cards he'd been dealt, instead of blacklisting half the squad and unfairly stretching everyone else past breaking point.",null,0,null,1440042674,null,null,false,0,cu94e2q,null,t3_3hl2i6,null,null,null,t1_cu8lnhm,null,null,null,1441357826,null,5,null,coys,t5_2ryq7,5,null

In terms of where to buy from I'll always first say to try and buy from the official website if you can. The proceeds go straight to the club and that's never a bad thing. It is costly for us American fans though, so you can order from US based sources to cut down on shipping costs.  
Places like WorldSoccerShop carry them and ship from the US (I believe), but shipping takes a while to get to you. You could also wait for the official shop to have a free worldwide shipping promotion because those do happen a few times a year.  
Depending on where you live there may be a supporters' club near you that bulk orders kits, which effectively eliminates the shipping costs from the price. That's how I'm getting my kit (spurple Mason) this season as NCSpurs does a bulk order every year.

If at any point you get *really* impatient, and just want to get through this ASAP, watch only the ones marked with exclamation points: (!!).

If you only watch two more episodes: The Girl in the Fireplace.  Then: Blink.

[ The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances ]
  Probably the Ninth Doctor's (your first) best story.  A two-word phrase near the end sums him up quite nicely, as well as the expression on his face as he watches a middle-aged couple arguing.

[ The Christmas Invasion ]
(Optional, depending on if you need to understand how they can get away with switching actors so much.)
  If you get impatient with this one, skip ahead to where the Tardis is on the spaceship with the big bad monsters and Rose and others, but before the Doctor appears.  Watch the rest of the episode.

!! [ The Girl in the Fireplace ]
This one is just awesome.  As well as being a fantastic episode, and based on your mention of a female fiance, I'll tell you that this episode features a gorgeous, intelligent French courtesan.  Who really existed.

[ Army of Ghosts/Doomsday ]
If only to watch Daleks and Cybermen trash-talking each other.

[ Family of Blood/Human Nature ]
Based on a book, this episode has a much more serious, emotional tone than most of the others.  David Tennant will make you cry.

!! [ Blink ]
Not that much of the Doctor or his companion in this one, but it's very nearly the most popular, and with good reason.

[ The Sound of Drums / Last of the Time Lords ]
Derek Jacobi, a rightly famous actor for a long time, is fantastic in this and obviously has a lot of fun.

!! [ Silence in the Library / Forest of the Dead ]
Another one considered the best.  Has fun with the way time travel can challenge relationships.  Also, a planet-sized library, so that's cool.

[ Midnight ]
This episode is the whole show's darkest and most disturbing, for me at least.  A very well done and savage deconstruction of the entire show.  Showcases Tennant's panic face.

[ The Stolen Earth / Journey's End ]
A great big, ambitious blowout episode.  Seems like it was supposed to be the last bit of the most popular Doctor, but several standalone special episodes follow, because he's just that damn hard to put down.

!![ The End of Time ]
A two-parter with a single name.  At the end, again, Tennant makes you cry.  End of his run.

.. okay, I have to sleep now, but off the cuff, good ones for Eleven are Vincent and The Doctor, A Good Man Goes to War, !! The Doctor's Wife (written by great fantasist Neal Gaiman), Journey to the Center of the Tardis.  !! The Day of the Doctor.

For Twelve, um.. Mummy on the Orient Express sums him up well.

Adebayor definitely got a run of games in the beginning of last season and wasnt effective. Soldado has had his chances without a doubt, stambouli gave away that penalty against palace and was never really trusted after, lennon played a number of games as well. Its not like these guys havent had any chance. Just less of a chance. That being said, bentaleb had a poor game vs united and he was dropped against stoke, so the Meritocracy that poch is building does have universal application. 

At the end of the day, we need to trust the manager. We have been backing the players for years and years now and it led to a disconnected squad and no cohesive play.  

another thing is that we never get to see these players day in and day out in training. Pochettino demands that players put in a lot of effort in training (they even wear those tracking devices on their chests to make sure they are running the miles and getting their heart rate up). Poch is a good manager, hes not mourinho but he has better ability than us to judge a player. Trust the man, give him his due time (a couple more seasons) and let the ship run its course. If he fails in two seasons, fine, he fails. Id rather him have a fair chance and create some stability in the club, along with Levy and Mitchell, as opposed to the previous revolving tenure at spurs.

Break down the average prices for various goods and services in the United States and the United Kingdom and you see that British consumers face a higher cost of living in almost every area. They pay 15% more for rent; 12% more for groceries; 50% more for restaurant meals; 52% more for utilities; and 135% more for gasoline, based on figures provided by Numbeo.

I tried to do some online legal research on UK and Indian Law. I have been trying to get a general overview of the areas of *hacking to intercept*, *privacy* and *confidence*, but so far I can't even find a background resource. 

I have been searching for weeks and I can't find any background resource for getting a overview. No legal encyclopedias, no restatements of the law and no practice manual.

* In another style, you have both **""Doomsday""** (Series 1 &amp; 2 OST) and -although I don't really like it- ""The Rueful Fate of Donna Noble"" (Series 4 OST)

i'm liking his intelligence off the ball. we've missed that since shirley left. our RW options today (willian, moses, cuadrado) seem to do their best work with the ball in front of defenders, and he'd offer us a different look. he'd be a great sub when we need a game winner, but i'm not convinced that the runs we're seeing here match our style of play.

that said, his pass completion percentage is pretty high, historically—something like 87%, i think. that'd put him up there with fab as best in our squad. that % might just be an artifact of barca's style, but it's good to know that he values possession like any good mourinho player should. it's this side of his game that suggests he could be starting material, or at least a sub who can come on to help close out games.

That was sort of the point. The introduction of future Rory and Amy was to lull you into a false sense of security so that the impact of losing Rory at the end of the story would be greater, and to introduce and reinforce the idea that time could be rewritten. 

The theme of the story in *Listen* is uncertainty. It seemed to me like the audience is supposed to be unsure of everything in the story, much like the Doctor and Clara. Looking back it looks like Orson's presence fulfilled a similar role to future Rory's, to give the audience a sense of security about Clara and Danny's future together so that Danny's death later on would be a greater surprise.

null,null,FredFnord,null,null,null,"&gt; There's only 13 states that have laws allowing then to drug test welfare recipients, and most of them are actually fair. As in, they have a program called SNAP which helps find unemployed welfare recipients a job.

Uh... you are totally wrong? SNAP is 'food stamps'. But don't let that stop you from being an expert, by all means.

&gt; Most jobs drug test, so why should they waste their time trying to find someone a job who is going to just fail their drug test?

Do you want an answer to that? It's because it costs more than ten times as much to drug test people to determine whether they 'deserve' help as it saves, because almost nobody who is tested comes up positive. And also because hey, do you really think we should be letting people who do drugs starve to death? (Since, as I said above, SNAP is FUCKING FOOD STAMPS.) If so, you're a sociopath, and if not, then this is an idiotic thing to do.
&gt; Another stipulation is they only drug test if there is strong reason to believe the person has a substance abuse problem

Hey look, he provided a source! Which, y'know, directly contradicts what he's saying but nobody's going to bother to look at it so he can just pretend it doesn't, right?

""At least thirteen states have passed legislation regarding drug testing or screening for public assistance applicants or recipients  [state list]. Some apply to all applicants...""

Yes. And the ONLY one that the Federal Government has said can't be bulk-drug-tested is SNAP. All the others can. And some states do. And several states are appealing the Federal Government's ruling on SNAP too.

&gt; 1. They do a comprehensive background screening and try to find out, and 2. If the person confess to appointments obviously high.

Actually, there are two studies in progress in two different states on this very subject. I'm betting that they find that drastically more black people get drug-tested than white people, even though the actual rate of drug use found is about the same between the two races. Because 'comprehensive background screenings' are often 'oh well yeh he looks druggish to me!'

&gt; I know people think our system is really fucked up, and it does have a lot of problems, but let's be honest, is there any way that there is going to be a perfect system? I think we're doing decent. And as long as we keep working towards improving it, it's only going to get better and better the more we learn.

Uh huh... uh huh... so you're saying that states finding more ways to deny people assistance constitutes 'getting better and better'? Well.

So who, then? Oscar, Willian, Eden, and Dave are all too cuddly. Courtois the Tortoise is a spud. Costa knows about words of English. That leaves Cahill, Matic, and Fabregas.

My vote is Cesc. He captained Arseneholes 11 years ago, so he knows the role, and he knows how to act like a captain (gravitas). He hasn't been around long, but he speaks good English and can translate for anyone who doesn't.
