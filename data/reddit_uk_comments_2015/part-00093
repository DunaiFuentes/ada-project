That's where I take issue with wage figures of 120-130,000 being used. It was clear from when Utd first signed Ronaldo that they had someone with the potential of becoming the best player in the world. The same with Barcelona and Messi. They just had that something extra from all other players that you can't teach and it was very evident from an early age. Does Sterling have that? Not in my opinion and therefore he will never come close to reaching the level them to are at. But even at what I would class as world class level (Luis Suarez Eden hazard) players. From a young age it was there clear as day to see they were going to be very good. Unfortunately Sterling does not convince me so much. Don't get me wrong I still rate Sterling very high as a youngster in our squad but I feel we have better talents on the way through (Jordan Ibe, Harry Wilson and shay ojo) so we shouldn't just start throwing money at the first prospect who shows potential.

For now, we have the [Museum &amp; Winter Gardens](http://www.seeitdoitsunderland.co.uk/sunderland-museum-winter-gardens), behind that is [Mowbray Park](http://www.sunderland.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=2471), which hosted [Split Festival](http://www.splitfestival.com/). We also have the [Glass Centre](http://www.nationalglasscentre.com/) and [Wildfowl Park](http://www.wwt.org.uk/wetland-centres/washington/).

The majority of investment is going towards the immediate area out The Bridges, the old Crowtree Leisure Centre has been knocked down and I think they're looking to expand the [shopping centre](http://www.sunderland.gov.uk/committees/CMIS5/Document.ashx?czJKcaeAi5tUFL1DTL2UE4zNRBcoShgo=Y2IZCev3A2UoWlUdE2I6lYK3xCy1PYO44Lz5Fvc62UvOb%2fXwHVLO5g%3d%3d&amp;rUzwRPf%2bZ3zd4E7Ikn8Lyw%3d%3d=pwRE6AGJFLDNlh225F5QMaQWCtPHwdhUfCZ%2fLUQzgA2uL5jNRG4jdQ%3d%3d&amp;mCTIbCubSFfXsDGW9IXnlg%3d%3d=hFflUdN3100%3d&amp;kCx1AnS9%2fpWZQ40DXFvdEw%3d%3d=hFflUdN3100%3d&amp;uJovDxwdjMPoYv%2bAJvYtyA%3d%3d=ctNJFf55vVA%3d&amp;FgPlIEJYlotS%2bYGoBi5olA%3d%3d=NHdURQburHA%3d&amp;d9Qjj0ag1Pd993jsyOJqFvmyB7X0CSQK=ctNJFf55vVA%3d&amp;WGewmoAfeNR9xqBux0r1Q8Za60lavYmz=ctNJFf55vVA%3d&amp;WGewmoAfeNQ16B2MHuCpMRKZMwaG1PaO=ctNJFf55vVA%3d). 

Right next to that is the new [Keel Square](http://sunderlandkeelline.org.uk/about), next to it will be a [new hotel](http://www.sunderlandecho.com/news/business/new-luxury-hotel-and-extension-to-the-bridges-in-multi-million-regeneration-of-sunderland-1-7139568) and over the (newish) road from there will be more modern buildings for shops and offices, after the old Vaux Brewery site (RIP) was torn down 15 years ago and a battle against Tesco ensued, meaning it was a plot of mud for years and years. Absolutely farcical, but at least something is getting done now.

A bit further down the road will be another [new hotel](http://www.sunderlandecho.com/news/business/work-stops-on-7-5million-hotel-for-sunderland-after-builder-s-collapse-1-7147840), as well as renovations to the old [Gas Board building.

As for pubs and nightlife, my favourite is the pub is the [Ship Isis](https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Isis-Sunderland/214780425210106), two minutes from the town centre. There's a bit of a hidden gem outside the town, at The Rosedene.  A few new pubs and bars have been springing up, but we're still quite a small town and (if it matters), Tuesday is gay night.  We have the beautiful [Empire](http://www.sunderlandecho.com/news/business/work-stops-on-7-5million-hotel-for-sunderland-after-builder-s-collapse-1-7147840) and the Stadium of Light plays host to [huge music names](http://www.safc.com/hospitality-and-events/whats-on) in the summer (Foo Fighters in 75 days, Kanye and Rihanna TBC), there's always something on at [Pop Recs](https://www.facebook.com/PopRecsLtd) or [Independent](https://www.facebook.com/independentsunderland).

Speaking of the SOL, the land around there has a decent sized swimming pool, are [building a hotel on there](http://www.sunderlandecho.com/news/business/work-starts-on-sunderland-s-new-hilton-hotel-1-6988462) and are looking to open their own Free School.

Staying at that the north side of the river, our best beaches are there! [Roker Beach](http://www.thebeachguide.co.uk/north-east-england/tyne-and-wear/roker.htm) has clean water, a [few cafes](http://www.safc.com/hospitality-and-events/whats-on/beach-house), a [Marine Centre](http://www.marineactivitiescentre.co.uk/adventuresunderland/) and is the official end to the [C2C route](http://www.cycle-routes.org/wearsiderangers/To%20guide%20and%20celebrate%20the%20finishing%20of%20the%20C2C%20&amp;%20W2W.html).  Futher along, the [pier is safe to walk along again](http://www.sunderlandecho.com/news/local/all-news/roker-pier-reopens-after-850k-repairs-due-to-a-century-of-north-sea-weather-1-6977937), Roker Park is really nice (not the football ground) and pretty much the whole sea-front is undergoing a huge [facelift from Roker to the top of Seaburn](http://www.sunderlandecho.com/news/sunderland-seafront-s-5million-facelift-slideshow-1-5400536).  If you can catch us on a sunny day, the walk from the town centre to Whitburn, or even Shields, is wonderful. There areas hold the [air show](http://www.sunderlandlive.co.uk/airshow) too

Elsewhere, it's always worth walking up to see [Penshaw Monument](http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/penshaw-monument/) and going around [Herrington Park](http://www.sunderland.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=2441).  Nice big open spaces, the [Marathon of the North](https://www.facebook.com/marathonofthenorth), [egg-rolling](http://www.sunderlandlive.co.uk/events/penshaw-bowl-2015) and a [fun-fair](https://www.facebook.com/pages/North-Easts-Largest-Funfair-at-Penshaw-Monument/141310922724344) are there during the summer.

Transport is easy, hop on the Metro to go to Newcastle (beyond that is the airport and N.Tyneside), or jump on a train to go to Durham, the Metro Centre or Hartlepool (ha, just kidding with the last one).

Come on down for a day and bring a jacket, it's always fucking freezing here.

I think he's on to something there. While undoubtedly there have been 'bad' emergent news stories from British politics over the years, such as the ongoing child molestation stories, cash for questions, cash for peerages, and in the public eye; the expenses scandal (although I actually do not think that was wrong). However there's an ongoing narrative that *all* politicians are basically shits,  and that they're incompetent, i.e.; David Cameron is a heartless bastard who can't run the country, Ed Miliband is incompetent etc etc rather than focusing on process and what's happening. So you end up with a generation who inherently believe concepts like this, but minus the understanding of political process, so you end up with stuff like this

As there is no traffic management and no contention, it can also be configured so each house gets a fair share of 1/n percent of the bandwidth, but if other houses aren't maxing out their own, you can burst it to more than that.

Many people only have landlines because they are mandatory for traditional broadband; if people really wanted one they could get a SIP phone for ~£10/month - add a cheap SIP handset for £50 or so, or an adaptor to use your existing phones with SIP for less and within a year you're now paying less than traditional line rental.",null,0,null,1426084875,null,0,1426085172,0,cpbfkmt,null,t3_2ynuk3,null,t1_cpbfkmt,null,t1_cpbe74b,null,null,null,1427700372,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Labour are undeniably very authoritarian, which is a socially ""right wing"" stance. [They're not a progressive party (socially)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sWRXr2Yu9g).

However they are more left wing economically. They're more socialist than the tories, they're generally going to be more in favour of progressive taxation.

I think it's a disparity between this division which is upsetting some self-identified liberals like the author of this article. Social change is progressing quite rapidly at the moment, with LGBT (mostly just LGB so far) rights and awareness improving a lot. The issue the author has of feeling out of place among leftwing social discussion is not uncommon, I've seen it a lot.

&amp;nbsp;

All of that so far is probably uncontroversial, but I might be about to upset some people here. I think the reason this group feels indignant about being called out on various social issues is that as self-identified liberals, they feel that puts them ""on the right side"". They seem to feel that because they identify as such, they are above being wrong or hurtful on a social issue.

I think the author of the article is a good example of this lack of introspection. He puts the LBGT “community” in scare quotes and says he believes ""the jury is still out about whether gender identity is entirely constructed"". I'm not saying he's not socially left wing, or applying the kind of assumption creep he talks about. However you can be a socially left wing, well meaning liberal and still hold beliefs which are regressive and damaging. I'm sure we all do to some extent.

Still, the biggest failing is with the people who criticise without discussing and educating. The jury is not out on gender identity:

&gt;Studies... seem, at least, to indicate that individuals are born with an innate sense of their gender identity, which does not necessarily accord with the genital appearance, and cannot necessarily be overridden by consistent socialisation supported by hormone administration (Diamond, 1965; Zhou et al., 1995; Diamond, 1999; Kruijver et al., 2000,2002; 2003; Swaab et al.,2003).

&gt;[...]It is postulated that, in those who experience severe gender dysphoria, the sex differentiation of their brains has not followed the pattern usually predicted by the earlier steps in the differentiation process (such as the chromosomes, genitalia and gonads) “but has followed a pattern typical of the opposite sex in the final stage of that differentiation process” (Gooren, 1999; Gooren and Kruijver, 2002) - [GIRES review on atypical gender development](http://gires.org.uk/assets/Research-Assets/atypical-gender-development.pdf) (pdf)

Verochio is going to be an additional rate taxpayer - this means the total tax due on dividends will be 37.5% (less 10% tax already paid). In addition, any non-dividend income (payments from fixed interest) will be taxed at 45%.

By sheltering income-producing assets within the ISA, this tax isn't paid.

You can't control income distributions - they come rolling in every year and the tax falls due when the income is paid.

Contrast this against capital gains - the tax rate on capital gains is 28% (more favourable than 37.5% or 45%). More importantly, though, capital gains are only payable on sale of an asset, and everybody has an annual allowance of gains (£11,000ish) before the tax is paid.

Because of this, you can manage your CGT liability - if you had £100,000 of, say, Vanguard FTSE UK All Share and it grew by 10% in a year, you could sell this on the last day of the tax-year, crystallising a £10,000 gain and using your allowance.

You could then buy, say, Fidelity UK Index (equivalent fund) for £110,000, ""resetting"" your CGT liability.

This ignores the income payable in the untaxed account, which is why the strategy makes most sense with growth assets (low-dividend indices or funds).",null,0,null,1426085856,null,0,false,0,cpbg48f,null,t3_2yjf6s,null,t1_cpbg48f,null,t1_cpbfoiq,null,null,null,1427700627,null,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1,null

No, *some* ISPs require it, but it is not something Openreach or Ofcom require. The big ISPs tend to demand it, smaller ones don't - because of the reasons already stated (more profit).

There are also technical reasons behind it - ISPs like Sky will rent the entire copper line and plug it into their equipment, so they require you to move the voice component over too. The other option is to rent only the broadband bit but Sky does not do this anymore

&gt; The cost for providing a physical line needs to be a part of your broadband package so we can we see what the real costs for a decent internet connection are.

i also would say that i've been extremely impressed with sterling of late in that striker role. sterling hasn't scored at the rate of a suarez or sturridge, but how many do? what's most impressive is the way he's been dragging defenders across the pitch. he opens up a lot of space for the team and that's why sterling has been effective and been a lynchpin of this new system we're in.

agreed however on the point to prove. every player should have a point to prove until they retire. i think raheem has a chip on his shoulder because he's been so small his whole life. i think people have been high on his talent for a long time and telling him he's great, but i think he always will have a chip on his shoulder because people have probably also been telling him he's too small, isn't a good enough finisher, relies on his speed too much, etc, etc...i love both players as prospects, but sterling is a MUCH MUCH more complete player and will develop a wider skill set than ibe. dont' get me wrong ibe will be fantastic, but sterling is can create, he can score, he can defend...he can play anywhere on the pitch minus keeper and cb, and im not so sure he couldn't get a job done there either.

For the last time... 

She’s had over two decades to make this claim. She did not whilst her ex-partner had few finances worth going after. 

Now that he has successfully founded a £57million (approx.) business and is doing well for himself, *now* she wants financial repayment. 

Why now? Did he do something? It’s not indicated so the only logical conclusion is that she saw his net worth and decided she wants a piece. She is going after his money for personal gain at a time that suits her, not because it’s due process immediately after the divorce. 

This is surely a calculated move designed to increase her overall gain versus what she would have received twenty years ago. 

That’s it. Very simple.

Isn't the point to win? To win everything? Sporting competition means first or last—there is not a single man on the roster hoping to finish second. That doesn't mean second isn't  respectable. That doesn't mean second can be ignored. But even around the sub here fans are, like players, looking for first. It's what they should do.

And as far as support being only local, get the fuck off it. Ownership isn't local. Players aren't local. Endorsements aren't local. Football is a world sport. What goes on in Manchester sells seats, but that doesn't mean Manchester and England are the only acceptable place to support or discuss or consider opinion. This is exactly what contracts this sub so much. ""We are in Manchester, and we loved them first"" is a bullshit excuse to dismiss people who want to be compatriots. Who cares when and why someone hose a team? As long as they stick with the team, through all levels of failure, and love them regardless, then all fans should be welcomed—especially now that City has become a global franchise.

I support American football, and love when European, and especially British fans get involved and are interested in my team. I love my team
 I want it to grow. I want a world super power. I want to be able to pull any player any time. I don't care where players or fans come from, as long as they are truly dedicated.

And before you decide to chop me down for picking City because they are a world power now, let me stop you. I chose City after following the World Cup this past year, as I'm sure many did. I had never taken an interest in any sport as a child, and only as an adult have I been able to see the beauty and complexity of peak athletic competition. The World Cup brought that to me, every day, for a month. And it brought me Yaya Toure and the Ivorian national team, who I was astonished by. It brought me Fernandinho and the Brazilians. It brought me our three Argentinians and the magician from Spatoo. I couldn't help but following non-American squads because I wanted to see these players I'd never heard of, these amazing athletes who were clearly some of the best in the world. Then I found out that they all played for a single Premier side. And that was it. I devoured City literature and history, looked for every media outlet that covered the team, and found this sub, which has been a truly dynamic place to educate myself. And I proclaimed loyalty. And I've watched and waited and felt hurt when poor losses have come and felt joy when big wins have, too. So go on and tell me to fuck off. Tell me I'm not from North England and so I have no right. But don't expect me to relinquish my new love and respect for this club.

I still believe it's wrong to apply your own experiences however. Clarkson being his friend is the only constant we have. Everything else is fluid, and the conversation is private.

It's fun, sure - but it was my hamfisted way of trying to tie into the original point, the idea that the public are justifying an alleged assault for their own entertainment interests. It's fun, of course. I think it's dangerous when speculation fuels demands, before the facts are made clear. I do appreciate your posts didn't claim the opposite however. (Hamfisted, like I said :) )

""All you need is access to a car"", well that's not really a given at all. That car needs to be taxed and MOT'd, and the learned needs to be insured on it. You then need someone over 21 who's been driving more than three years and is willing to take you out in it. And whilst they might not be a qualified instructor, they are at least qualified to drive a car. 

I don't believe that requiring a proper test *is* excessive, I think it should be the norm - not to make things difficult for people, but to stop them from killing themselves by riding with no clue what they're doing or how roads work. I don't think that sticking someone on a bike and letting them loose in rush hour is the way to do things at all. I agree with you that fast-track courses aren't great, but they're certainly better than the current alternative - no training whatsoever. It certainly could not create a worse standard of riding. 

The fundamental problem is that people seem to think they have a right to be on the roads - they do not. Driving and riding are pastimes which have the ability to easily cause massive damage, injury and death to innocent third parties, and it's not something people should take for granted. If you genuinely said that you wouldn't pay the £35 for the theory test in order to get a CBT, I'd say you shouldn't be riding then. 

I agree with you though about the levels of test, the main thing I think needs to change (as per my original point) is that before you're allowed out on the road, you should have to pass a theory test. That's it. It's not a difficult test, it's not an expensive test, and if you know the highway code then you'd pass it without even needing to revise. And if you don't know your highway code, you shouldn't be on the road because you're a danger to others.

In 1997 his finances began to improve considerably. 

Meanwhile “The court heard Miss Wyatt found a new partner in 1993 and had two more children with him – but that he subsequently did not finance the family either.”

Well bugger me if there isn’t a pattern emerging here.

The case is pretty open and shut by your own link. He had no money when they divorced so she didn’t go after it. She *claims* she didn’t feel safe around him but there’s no evidence to prove that either way (why not go to the police who would surely support her as she seeks proper compensation…) and it would appear from her pattern of failed marriages and having children with each partner at an early age that she’s now clutching at straws because he’s rich enough to be worth going after. 

Strangely it’s also mentioned in the article that she’s been forced to travel from her home to the hearings by bus… but that she sleeps in a bus shelter. Well…. Which is it? 

I’ve seen enough. He made his money after she exited his life and now she’s after the goods. The man might not be a paragon of virtue but he went on to be successful whilst she scratched around for support for her poor life choices. I feel sorry for her, but she doesn’t deserve the roughly £100,000 per year since her divorce that she is claiming for.

Well it seems clear that they are more of a liberal leaning leftist more than anything, rather than a hardcore self-contradicting authoritarian leftist. It's shocking in one respect to see how the authoritarian left justifies Islamic extremism, however when one considers the residual lust for authoritarianism it's more understandable. Often the social justice views they hold are very tenuous and secondary to their oft violent idealism.

I mean, I'd share their views on gender identity (we know it's not all constructed, I don't know why people feel the need to push such absolutes), Islam etc.

* Snapchat, Instagram, Whatsapp, Tinder has gone more mainstream and are the go to social networking tools of the teenage generation. Facebook has virtually died and is only used to look at unilad videos and message people you have no other way of contacting.

* Internet of things is starting to take of, my parents now have a smart thermostat, contact less payments are my preferred option and most stores are catering for this. 

* On-line banking is becoming default, I've not been in a branch in the last 12 months and doubt I will in the next 12. As a result more branches are closing and will continue to do so.

* Job searching has transitioned fully on line now and it has made it worst. Job boards are cluttered with recruitment agency ads and every position has hundreds of applicants that need to meet minimum application requirements from the job centre.

* Real ale has come into fashion and hipsters up and down the country are buying more of it and ""trendy"" bars are selling it. 

* Political apathy is probably at it's worst I have ever seen. Both main parties are completely uninspiring and have very little to offer and concentrate on irrelevant political spats about things people don't care about and don't have any real enthusiastic supporters any more. As a result UKIP, SNP and the Greens have been sweeping up voters from the main parties.        

* Television has countless programs about people on benefits, immigrants and a class warfare mentality is enshrined in the media. 

* People are more worried about unstable parts of the world, especially Russia and Middle East. 

I'm sure there are more and these are not specifically this year but things I've noticed more this year.

null,false,TurbowolfLover,null,null,null,"In July 2013, a report commissioned by the BBC Trust found that the organisation had been slow to reflect widespread public concerns about immigration to the UK, and shifts in public attitudes within the UK towards the European Union. The report, by Stuart Prebble, stated that Helen Boaden, the former director of BBC News, had said that when she arrived at the organisation there had been a ""deep liberal bias"" in the handling of immigration issues. It also stated that, within the BBC, ""the agenda of debate is probably too driven by the views of politicians"", but that ""overall the breadth of opinion reflected by the BBC on this subject is broad and impressive, and no persuasive evidence was found that significant areas of opinion are not given due weight today."" It also stated that the BBC was ""slow to give appropriate prominence to the growing weight of opinion opposing UK membership of the EU, but in more recent times has achieved a better balance"".

The BBC has a “deep liberal bias” and has failed to reflect the public’s growing concerns about immigration and the European Union, Helen Boaden, the BBC’s former director of news admitted in July 2013.

Their own report says they have a liberal bias. Pass off everybody else's views as ""confirmation bias"" all you like, but if the organisation itself says it has a left wing bias ... they have a left wing bias.

I don't think that is true. If it were true there would be far less disenchantment with our politics than there is.

This luke warm government is probably the closest to representative we've ever had. If the public were happy with simplistic politics then they'd be in love with our politics after Thatcher and Blair dominating recent history.

The public is largely divided into those who believe the system can be changed via the vote and those who think we're stuck with red/blue and thus we best get the lesser evil in.

And speaking of Real Madrid, that's probably the team with more pressure and unrealistic expectations from the fans than anyone, yet they keep getting top players.
  
2. Agreed. They haven't done too well with transfers lately (although personally, I think Di Maria just needed a season to adjust to the Premier League and will dominate next season). But unfortunately, it doesn't matter because they just have so much money. They can just keep spending until they have a great team, it would take several consecutive failed seasons (failing to make top 4 or win a major trophy) to really put a dent in their revenue.

Except that they *don't* know. One problem with the UK ticketing system is that it is rather overcomplicated and that there are often misinterpretations and missold tickets from both customers and rail staff.

I am not actually talking about myself, but people on a rail forum I frequent - some of whom are other rail staff who can prove that an error has occured, and others who are customers who (after a lot of complaint) have it in writing that the train company admits the error and apologises for the inconvenience, often with some monetary compensation

&gt; If you are judged to have the wrong ticket, it is your fault for buying the wrong ticket.

Um, no - one member of train staff is not the sole judge and jury of whether a ticket is valid - especially when it can be proven that a ticket or travel situation is not against the rules. Just like how in a real court, the judge making up his/her own rules and applying a judgment from those would not be taken seriously by anyone else if appealed

&gt; I don't believe that requiring a proper test is excessive

People seem to believe the CBT is a test, when it's not. Perhaps it wouldn't be a leap to actually make it one?

&gt; I don't think that sticking someone on a bike and letting them loose in rush hour is the way to do things at all.

Definitely agree.  
But, as we know, someone can pass their test after riding during quiet hours, then jump on a bike into rush hour traffic and not have a clue what to do. And be subjected to impatient arseholes who will deliberate victimise them due to L plates.

&gt; It certainly could not create a worse standard of riding.

My line of thinking on that one is: If you have to sit a test before getting out on the road, many will do it as quickly as possible, where before they may have taken a more relaxed pace at it, getting more lessons as they need.  
Then they pass their test [because everything is still fresh in their head, rather than properly learned], and think they can ride. They forget the new things, due to lack of reinforcement, and ride shite for the rest of the time.  
It could go either way, I guess...

&gt; The fundamental problem is that people seem to think they have a right to be on the roads - they do not.

Do you pay taxes? You have a right to the road.

&gt; Driving and riding are pastimes

not for everyone. Increasingly so, the ability to travel are becoming a necessity. And public transport sucks.

&gt; If you genuinely said that you wouldn't pay the £35 for the theory test in order to get a CBT, I'd say you shouldn't be riding then.

EDIT: first bit of bad news ""European legislationsets out the requirements of the moped and
motorcycle licence acquisition test . This includes the minimum
ages that riders must be and the amount of experience that they
must have, in order to ride certain sized motorcycles.

CBT is not regulated by any European legislation and has
remained largely unchanged since its introduction""

This means any changes to the A2-A could be hard to pass :(

So far a focus seems to be on tailoring each CBT to each individuals circumstances, with a focus on the highway code for younger riders with a bad highway code knowledge and a proof of being able to ride solo before a CBT is issued.

Possible long term consideration to make learned complete theory test before a CBT. (makes sense to me)

They want to find a way to be able to judge specific schools and give recognition to those who are achieving a specific level of training. This will hopefully improve the training over the whole community as all schools will want to achieve this. They like to remind that 2 hours road riding is the *minimum* and most riders will require more

""Restricting riding to automatic motorcycles if CBT was taken
on an automatic Currently, completion of CBT on an automatic
motorcycle or moped also allows a rider to ride a small manual
motorcycle on the road"" 
Can't argue with this logic

""Some trainers also thought
that repeat CBT candidates, who might be considered as
experienced riders, should be ableto demonstrate continued
competence by only undertaking the onroad ride element of the
course""
Is this more sound logic from the government here? What am I seeing?

I am arguing that not everyone without a valid ticket is automatically a fare dodger (although a lot are)

&gt; If anything you are agreeing with me. Buy a ticket, if you are wrongfully punished, by your own admission, you get apologies and monetary compensation.



Except that it takes a lot of time, money, effort, to extract an apology - if you're lucky enough to get someone to admit it

The fact is that the dispute shouldn't occur anyway - the rules ought to be simplified in the first place to make it easier for everyone to remember and understand, but staff shouldn't have free roam to make it up as they go along and should give the benefit of the doubt if they are not absolutely sure.

&gt; Judge and jury? We are talking a small fine here, not 25 years in prison. Calm down. The world isn't perfect but if you pay for the stuff you use, 99% of the time there will be no issue at all. If you spend your time dodging fares you will run in to trouble. 

Actually, this isn't so clear cut. Penalty fares are not guaranteed and a train company could choose to take you to court without the option of a penalty fare or appeal, where you risk prosecution and a criminal record. Or you might end up having to talk to the BTP if a recalcitrant guard refuses to listen to reason and assumes you're criminal scum.

Each of the above, in isolation, may not have resulted in ""computer says no"", but the bank will use a ""balanced scorecard"" approach, and you may have just tipped things over.

null,false,seamushoo4,lfc68,,null,"what are you talking about? the second half of last season raheem was one of the players in the league who performed the most take ons, successful dribbles, and chances created? just think back to where raheem was this time last year and where ibe is this time this year (sterling was exactly the same age last year as ibe is now, they have the same birthday if you didn't know)..

let me just take you on a stroll down memory lane: remember february 8, 2014, raheem scored twice against arsenal. in april he scored a brilliant goal on city. a week after that scored twice against norwich. he was, in addition, from the turn of 2014, playing up through the middle. so he was not using his pace, but was making mazy runs up the field with the ball. ibe is definitely going to be a better finisher and maybe better with the ball at his feet, but you're doing raheem a huge disservice with what you are saying. 

and seriously? step overs? i hate when people measure how good some one is with the ball at their feet when you use pointless stepovers. what makes ronaldo so effective is he can beat players with them. early on in his career, ronaldo wasn't beating nearly as many players. 

i think my biggest problem with your response is youre trying to compare a 17 year old raheem to a 19 year old ibe. of course ibe looks better now than when raheem came into the side as a 17 year old. but when you do a side by side comparison of when they were both 19 (2013/2014 raheem), he is light years ahead of ibe. ibe is going to be an amazing player if he continues to grow and develop, but your scope of comparison is way off

edit: to say raheem didn't use his speed last year b/c he was playing in the middle was not what i meant, but rather he utilized his skill on the ball quite a bit, and was forced to. coutinho could have played there, but raheem was chosen and coutinho dropped deeper.

- The BBC will back down and allow Clarkson back, thereby tacitly admitting that even after his 'final warning' he can still carry on doing whatever he wants, which he will then continue to do while the BBC tuts and frowns in the background and Top Gear continues as normal until he gets bored of it and quits or the public goes off it, neither of which is likely to happen anytime soon.

Or...

- The BBC decides it's had enough and sacks him (or he resigns in frustration) and he gets picked up by another broadcaster pretty quickly (which if he's smart he should have planned for some time ago.) IIRC the other presenters have said before that they'd leave if Clarkson left, but it remains to be seen whether they actually will. Either way, after maybe a year or two of hiatus, Top Gear will continue somewhere else with a different name and a slightly tweaked format. I personally think Netflix would be a good candidate because they already show Top Gear, they can afford to make it with the same production quality and they don't really have to answer to anyone except the subscribers.

Some of those in his examples of people chastised for transgressive opinions on the left are Burchill, Bindel, Aaronovitch, Cohen and Mamet; with Aaronovitch and Cohen at least it was about really serious stuff.  iirc Cohen and Aaronovitch pretty blatantly tried to pull the same kind of thing as their opponents at the height of the 'Euston manifesto' and the fall out from the Iraq war and efforts to stop it, the political winds have just shifted (not all that much) the other way. I think they contributed a lot to the debate becoming toxic, but it probably would anyway because that was about stuff that really mattered. 

 I know that Bindel and Burchill are also 'provocateurs' who write inflammatory stuff and I think the problem with them was that they chose targets that were not 'outgroups' to a lot of their readers. Also, doesn't Julie Burchill write for the spectator now (her critique of islam stuff is hardly constructive from what I've seen) I'm not sure if she'd even describe herself as 'left of center.' I guess when people are struggling for 'discourse hegemony' (including the 'no platform' stuff)  and to make a career you'd expect things to turn toxic, and a lot of it is just bullies (who for a long time attacked 'acceptable targets') bullying the wrong people.

**Anne** We are not laughing about a mentally challenged person; what makes us laugh is the reactions of the other characters to her behaviour. Among other activities, she licks people, has a job (she is clearly not doing well), destroys plants and dresses as Celine Dion, while the other characters like to pretend everything is perfect and is going as planned. Moreover, Anne is making fun of them and their overly sympathetic indulgence; infact, whenever she speaks on her phone, we can see she is completely normal, and enjoying her freedom.
We don't laugh at Anne. She is laughing at the other characters on the show. We also laugh at them.

**Lou and Andy**
Again, we are not laughing at Andy, who is in a weelchair, but at the way Lou treats his friend: for Lou Andy is a pathetic and impotent person, who depends on him for everything. Lou will accept any requests from him, no matter how stupid or petty, in the end not treating Andy as a peer, but as a baby. Lou's hypocrisy is more evident because Andy is capable of wonderful things (from parachuting to horse riding), and Lou behaviour and blindess is the exaggerated reflections of our own hypocrisy on similar matters. We laugh at Lou's blindess and hypocrisy.

I could go on and on, but I won't.

It is impossible though to say what is funny and what is not: I think they are funny, but this is subjective!

&gt;But I know for a fucking fact when I first picked up a fag when I was around 11-12 it wasnt because of the bloody box! 

Maybe not consciously, but branding strongly influences decisions to smoke and influences smoking rates.  [It will only reduce smoking.](http://eppi.ioe.ac.uk/cms/Default.aspx?tabid=3327)

&gt;Plain packaging has been shown to:

&gt;Reduce pack and product appeal, by making packs appear less attractive and of lower quality, and by weakening the positive smoker identity and personality attributes associated with branded packs;

&gt;Increase the salience of health warning, in terms of improving the recall and perceived seriousness and believability of warnings; 

&gt;Reduce the confusion about product harm that can result from branded packs.

&gt;Plain packaging was also perceived as likely to have a deterrent effect on the onset of smoking by young people and as likely to encourage existing smokers to quit. The review also found some evidence that non-smokers and, to a lesser extent, smokers, approved of the idea of plain packaging, with both groups feeling it would make smoking less attractive, particularly to young people.",null,0,null,1426092863,null,0,1426097630,0,cpbkg31,null,t3_2yovy7,null,t1_cpbkg31,null,t1_cpbjkoh,null,null,null,1427702646,null,20,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,20,null

I would have missed my train if I had gone there to get a ticket. This is in fact legitimate grounds for getting on the train without a ticket (this is the case if there is a ticket-queue of over 5 minutes, it turns out).

I got on the train and went straight to the first staff member I saw, which was at the destination station. She asked me if I had any ticket at all, and I said I had a London Underground Oystercard, but that I was not travelling on that and wanted to buy a national rail ticket (return). She said I had gone out of zone on my Oystercard and made me pay the penalty fair, and for two single tickets there and back. This made a £16 ticket become about £43. I paid up, partly because she called a Transport Policeman who stood over me while I did it. She said I could appeal.

I appealed explaining the whole thing. The appeals officer asked for my oystercard number, and then said that I had been travelling on that, when I expressley explained that I had tapped-out of Oyster, and tried to use the National Rail ticket machines which were not working. The appeals person also said the ticket office at my starting station was open at the time.

I'd also explained in my second letter to the appeals dept that I had paid the penalty already, but it turns out the ticket clerk filled out the form incorrectly, so as it stands they are trying to collect the penalty from me again.

Generally speaking you get a bonus for playing, a bonus if the team wins and a bonus for a clean sheet.

It's getting rarer for a goalkeeper to get more for a clean sheet than a midfielder.

Same goes for a striker.

It takes away from the team mentality to make the players only trying to get their own tally higher.

Saying that the top players will get more for playing and wins.

There's some clubs that may still offer assist or goal bonuses but it's nothing like it used to be.

It would mean that you wouldn't play it to your winger to put a cross in because he'd get the assist bonus. Or you wouldn't play it to your strike partner because he'd get the goal bonus.

It also means that the midfielder with no clean sheet bonus at 4-nil up wouldn't be trying as hard as the defender or 'keeper.

The constant attack on the welfare system proves that.

Labour themselves have stated that they will be [tougher than the tories on benefits](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/12/labour-benefits-tories-labour-rachel-reeves-welfare)

&gt;They're allowing a lot of multi-multi-million pound companies to get away with paying no tax (I know it's legal, but the government can make it not legal) whilst taking what little the poorest actually have, off them.

When has that not been a problem? It was a problem throughout Labour's tenure and continues to be a problem now. It's more of a game of cat and mouse with companies finding loopholes and the govt slowly patching them up. It's a bit disingenuous to imply that it's unique to the tories. [In fact tax avoidance dramatically increased under labour if you look old papers.](http://www.standard.co.uk/news/ministers-staggered-at-tax-dodging-under-labour-6514481.html)

On the other hand, the coalition have reduced taxes on the poor. Increased some taxes for the rich. They're introducing, albeit very slowly, the universal credit so that people transitioning from JSA to work don't loose out on any money.

Meanwhile it was Labour who got rid of the 10p tax rate meaning that when Brown left office anyone earning above about 5k was paying 20% on anything above that. Osborne has increased the threshold by thousands and it will be 10k from this April. That means Osbourne dramatically lowered taxes on the poorest when Brown increased them.

And from wiki Gordon Brown

&gt;Increased the tax thresholds in line with inflation, rather than earnings, which rise more quickly during periods of economic growth. This results in fiscal drag in which more taxpayers are drawn into the upper rates

and

&gt; Corporation tax fell under Brown, from a main rate of 33% (pre-1997) to 30% (1999) and then 28% (2007)

All this stuff about tories hating the poor and labour not is Labour party spin.

And my personal favourite. Labour introduced university fees in '98 with a much lower threshold for paying them back. This disproportionately effected poorer students. Then in the the 2001 General Election, the Labour manifesto stated that Labour ""will not introduce top-up fees and has legislated against them."" They then introduced top-up fees almost immediately. And now they have the audacity to claim that you can't trust the coalition on student fees.

Labour has great spin doctors and they create this image of left wing men and women of the people when in fact they are no better than anyone.

But when your in the entertainment industry, it no longer matters because people no longer care. So long as the selfish viewers get their entertainment, people really are not interested in what you do (so long as its within reason).

There are many examples of this, most recently being Saurez compared to Ched Evans. 
One person has assaulted multiple people live on TV and the viewers dont seem to care (or care but only to a small degree). Yet the other has committed rape (in the eye of the law) which has crossed the line of what is and isnt acceptable to the public.

Ibe has shown potential, but I don't think he really looks like he could be world class like Sterling has yet. It's the same with Ojo and Wilson, they haven't played enough games yet.. there has been COUNTLESS 16-18 year olds with a shit ton of hype who've been in our academy but haven't been able to step up to the first team in the past so I'm reserving judgement on them.

Ibe got his first start at 17.. yes but he wasn't really part of the first team until about 3 weeks ago when he was 19 years old. Sterling on the other hand joined the first team at the age of 17 and played 38 games in that season. Ibe's joined the first team about 18 months later through his career than Sterling did (Ibe was 19 years old and 2 months old whilst Sterling was 17 years old and 8 months).

Another important fact is that Ojo and Wilson are both older now (both very close to 18 years old) than Sterling was when he joined our first team.

The most obvious thing is just keep watching matches, any match you can doesn't have to be Spurs. The more you watch the game, the more you'll learn about the game... you'll see certain situations crop up and how different players and different types of players deal with them, you'll learn different formations and how players operate within systems on both a micro (1v1 situations) and macro (over the course of 90 minutes) level. You're really going to need a strong understanding of the game itself in order to really begin dissecting performances on an individual level. In fact, it's probably advisable that you start watching some non-Spurs games if you're looking to really sink your teeth into the game. 

The second piece of advice I would give is when you watch some matches, don't follow the ball. This is where watching non Spurs games comes in handy especially as you'll ultimately care less the outcome and will allow you to study as a student. I'll give you a Spurs example here, you saw Ryan Mason's first PL goal, the second against Swansea, ye? In real-time, it probably seems as though he's fortunate to have the ball fall into his path form Ashley Williams (?) tackle on Eriksen. 

HOWEVER, if you watch it back and ignore the ball, you see that it is actual his forward run from the midfield to support Eriksen that puts him in the position to score the goal. Footballers at a professional level are constantly calculating and decision making, even tiny things like moving a few yards over to drag someone marking them out of position can have a HUGE impact on a match, so ignoring the ball and just following a specific player can educate you on those more ""non-obvious"" things that fly under the radar.

Thirdly, your opinion is yours! There will always be people who are harping against players that you thought had a good game, none of us are perfect and football can often be subjective. An example of that for you is Danny Rose. Danny Rose makes some BRAINLESS decisions in our third with the ball, however he works very well in our system because he is willing to bomb forward down the left and provide width in the attack, meaning if we play someone like Eriksen/Chadli in front of him, they can cut in and create chances without sacrificing width. However, this means that after any given game some people will say he was out of position, others that he was doing his job. At the end of the day it's largely subjective, and that's why as fans our opinions are worth nothing and we have Poch to analyze games.

Sorry for the wall of text, work really is crawling today...

TL;DNR 1. Watch as much football as possible, 2. Don't always watch the ball 3. Opinions are like assholes, we all have one.

That is now irrelevant. Because if you were patronised, then there is nothing I can do to fix that for you. 

However, your persistent doubting questions, and pokes at my credibility, has made me actually want to link an article with my byline. 

I mean you have actually made me want to reveal the name behind my Reddit account which I have been using anonymously for two years while working in the UK and Middle East. Do you understand what I'm saying here? I cannot express to you the urge to paste in a dozen or so links to my work so you would shut the hell up and accept that ""not everyone on the Internet makes up lies"".

But that fact that you are actually pushing so hard, and you have clearly turned this personal while adding no actual comments to the debate, makes me uncomfortable to the point that it is something I will never, ever, do with this account. Reddit is the only bastion of privacy that I enjoy and relish through the course of my profession. It is the only public forum that I have have an anonymous account, and you're asking me give that up? Why don't we just ask everyone to give up their names too?

The moment I give you a link to any samples of my early work you will have my name. And from that you also would have my organisation, and my listed phone numbers and email addresses, plus my Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook.  From those, you could go through and probably find all the same for my partner. Do you honestly, honestly, (yes I wrote that twice) think I am going to risk publicly revealing my name behind an anonymous Reddit account? Of course not. You have proved yourself very dogged in your pursuit of me today, and yes you did get under my skin. But there's no chance in hell of me giving up this account.

And as I have explained to someone else, I acted as a stringer reporter writing field reports while working as a geologist in Africa, and have you ever seen an AFP, Reuters, PA, AP story? They. Dont. Get. Bylines.

People wrongly assume that means ""a free paid holiday as a punishment"", when actually it just means ""get him off the streets and off active duty until the investigation into his conduct is concluded, but don't actively penalise him by docking his pay until wrongdoing and guilt are conclusively established"".

In both these cases the initial treatment is not the *conclusion* of the process - it's the holding action while the investigation proceeds.  Once it's finished *then* the conclusion (and if appropriate, any punishment) are determined and enacted.

TL;DR: People are fuckwits, and mistake value-neutral investigatory procedure for punishment/reward.",null,0,null,1426096346,null,0,false,0,cpbmq1k,null,t3_2yo45t,null,t1_cpbmq1k,null,t1_cpbgoko,null,null,null,1427703749,null,21,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,21,null

The thing that annoys me is that **UKIP and Nigel Farage are so heavily bashed with this ""assumption creep""** that what they are *actually saying* is rarely directly addressed. Everyone is too busy jumping to conclusions and bashing them for just that. Like the writer of this article says -

&gt;To actually address the issues is thus avoided, because who needs to debate with a bad person? It’s enough just to condemn them.

We see it constantly. Who actually directly discusses what UKIP say rather than demonising them as the ""racist right wing"". Can we actually *listen to what they say and directly address it?*

If their policies are so bad they need to be addressed in open debate. Every time you demonise UKIP you are strengthening the resolve of UKIP and their voters because you are *failing to actually address what they have to say*.

As for supporting the local team, most Americans do the same, we just don't gloat about it. Not only that, but America has a very diverse team sporting culture. NBA, MLB, NFL, and even the NHL all have vast followings. I could go on for days about the differences in the 2 countries sporting cultures, which in view is pretty massive. 

I'll close with this, because frankly, I'm done talking with someone as ignorant as yourself. If an American wants to watch good quality football, they have to turn to Europe.

There's a difference in milking the system and claiming what you're entitled to. There's nothing I claim that I'm not reasonably entitled to.

Student loan = I'm a full time student, so I'm able to get a maintenance loan/grant.

PIP = I'm autistic, I've got dyspraxia and I've got ADHD. The Man says I can get it, so I claim it. Not my fault is it?

Working Tax Credits = Because I claim PIP then I'm eligible to claim it working a minimum of 16 hours a week, not 30 as is normal. Again, not my fucking fault the rules are different.

Don't sit there and act like your shit doesn't stink - if you could claim something, you fucking would. I don't plan on moving out straight after I graduate because I won't have a big enough income to support a mortgage.

if you actually make contact i.e the punch connects its battery, but in a minor scuffle the penalty is the same. if the punch leads to injuries it becomes more serious.

most altercations are common assault and battery which are really just semantics since they carry the same penalty.

grievous and actual bodily harm is the primary ""oh shit"" moment, common assault is pretty minor.

but if for example you made it perfectly clear you didn't wish to be touched by me at ay point and i went forward to push you and you got out of the way or dodged it i have just committed assault, i have also commited assault if i tell you i'm going to do that without doing it and you run away before i do anything.

This isn't a short term deficit. There's no reason to think that something will change massively in the short term. Oil prices went through a prplonged period of high prices and are now closer to their historical norm. There is every reason to think this is a structural deficit - it's not predicated on fiscal stimulus it's just what it takes to keep Scotland at current spending levels. 

&gt;The Tories have fucked up the UK growth and as a result seen a fall in tax returns.

Under those terms the economy has actualy grown in Scotland under the Tories. The fault of Tory economics are that too much is consolodated at the top - not that the economy itself doesn't grow. The collpase in oil prices are the reason that the Scottish deficit has increased so much in this year's GERS.

Is it? I can't see any mention in the NRCOC about it - if you can't get to the train station in adequate time that is your fault (unless it is a connecting train, which the underground isn't AFAIK).

There's the ""minimum connection time"" but that's not relevant here

It's additionally clarified by some TOC documentation - e.g. https://www.firstgreatwestern.co.uk/-/media/PDF/TicketsAndTrainTimes/BuyBeforeYouBoard/Buy%20Before%20you%20Board%20DL%202015%20Web%20Ready%20%282%29.pdf?la=en where they won't accept queueing as an excuse

I think 99% of people from Wallsend or Blaydon or Forest Hall or Ponteland would say they are from Newcastle. These areas tend to be almost purely residential with the sole purpose of travelling into Newcastle to work. Gateshead and further-out South Tyneside towns like Boldon and Whitburn are slightly more separate, but not as much. Almost all of North Tyneside (save for perhaps Whitley Bay and North Shields) would call itself part of Newcastle. Jarrow, which isn't part of the City of Newcastle, is still part of its cultural folklore due to the Jarrow March, as is Blaydon (also in South Tyneside) due to the Blaydon Races. 

Barnsley and Doncaster have evolved completely separately Sheffield, and from each other. Wallsend and Blaydon have been part of Newcastle for about 150 years.

Come to Newcastle and you'll see what I mean. They aren't as localised as the towns you listed are and they're culturally identified as part of Newcastle.

Here you have identified a right-of-way issue - and you're right to be suspicious about this - because of [prescription](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/easements-claimed-by-prescription) it is possible a legal easement has been given on your land which is transferable even if the woman next door moves on. You would have to enquire of your conveyancer - but if you are like me and went for the lowest-cost conveyancing option they simply won't have the time to answer a complex query like this.

Check out every suspicion you have. Is there a lease issue? Is there an easement issue? Have you checked your neighbours' titles to find out if they have mortgaged themselves (at £3 a title it is worth buying copies).

I've lived in the north east for 19-20 years of my life and the appellation ""Newcastle"" stretches much further than the City's boundaries at the Tyne or Leazes Park or the A1 motorway.

The marked areas are Newcastle City (west/central), North Tyneside (north-east), South Tyneside (east) and Wearside (south-east). 

Look at the buildup that's continuous from the very west of the city and the Western Bypass (Fenham and the West Road) all the way to North Shields on the coast. Almost all of North and South Tyneside is directly connected to buildup from Newcastle.

Contrast it with the [buildup in South Yorkshire](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/South_Yorkshire_UK_location_map.svg/500px-South_Yorkshire_UK_location_map.svg.png) where there are several, distinct urbanised centres of population which simply don't exist in Newcastle, precisely because it almost is one city.

null,false,joethepro36,null,null,null,"As many of you know already, I used to consider myself left wing several years ago. I moved to the right after getting tired of the suppression of free speech by the left. An attitude of if you don't completely agree with me 100% you're the *enemy*. This can take many forms but the most common I've found is that critics of immigration are called ""racist"". It doesn't stop there though, if you oppose the crimes committed under Islam you'll also be called a ""racist"" because as we all know Islam is a race and not a *religion*.

This is one of the better Guardian articles I've read for a while because the decline of that paper has been down to it pandering to these airy fairy lefties who seem to hold the west in contempt and everything against it as a good thing. Apologists for the rapists in Rotherham and apologists for the Jihadists for instance all while attacking any residue of Christianity in this country.

&gt;This shame comes from the phenomenon of what I call assumption creep – the assumption that if you believe one thing you probably believe another thing, which you are hiding.

This has been applied to me on so many levels at so many times on this subreddit. I make a defence of a right wing viewpoint so people assume my views are further to the right. I then do not outright deny the accusations of supporting a further right wing viewpoint so people assume I support that too and then accuse me of extreme views.

You're basically forced to agree with this groupthink mentality, common to reddit in general because of the voting system. Good quality posts that disagree with this groupthink are downvoted, poor quality posts that agree are upvoted. You're lectured to by these types about free speech and all its apparent values while they desperately try to suppress your own.

Identity politics as an example is a cancer on current political discussion. If you do not agree *completely* with the ridiculous demands made you're some kind of bigoted transphobe. An example to this was on the model house of commons. The right *in general* was supportive of the basic tenets of a bill giving transgender people recognition under the authority of a medical doctor. However virtually all the right wing opposed this bill because it would allow *anyone of any age* to have surgery performed on their body. Cue the accusations of ""transphobia"" because our entire opposition was ""we don't think under 18 year olds should be able to make life changing choices"".

Many of us on the right in certain places have known full well of this destructive form of debate and have been keeping an eye on the progression of this style of debate. The conclusion reached was that those on the left who maintain this tactic will end up eating themselves. The feminists and the transgenders, the muslims, the athiests all finding themselves maybe not quite agreeing 100% and then attacking each other mercilessly. Do you ever wonder why the right wing is united and fairly strong at all times? It's because we don't tear each other down over minor disagreements. We are willing to compromise and work with people who's views we may somewhat detest. As long as the left feels the need to bicker and argue, heckle and jibe, downvote or make personal attacks on all right wing opinion it will never be a respectable force in politics.

Oh and on one final note, all those on the left will come out and say they agree 100% with the article because that's all they can do, agree with their fellow comrades but never respectfully disagree with another's opinions.

null,false,UncleArthur,null,null,null,"Perhaps not entirely relevant, but my story shows how applying for a credit card can be a bit ... random. I've banked with the same bank for 33 years. I've had a credit card for most of that time, with a four figure credit limit. I never miss payments, never have cheques bounced and am generally a good client. I pay the odd small amount of interest on a sometimes-used agreed overdraft limit, so they make some money out of me, although I pay my credit card off monthly (my work expenses go on it).

I needed to make a purchase for my daughter whilst she was sorting out her finance agreement, so I wanted to increase my credit card limit by £2k for 1 month. I 'phoned in a request and received a straight decline, without any reason given. Seriously. They just stuck with the ""computer says no"" line. So I called Customer Services and had the following conversation:

**Me:** ""Why was I declined for an increased credit limit?""

**Customer Services:** ""I don't know Sir, but have you tried applying for a new credit card?""

**M:** ""Um, no. Because I already have one.""

**CS:** ""Trust me. Try it.

**M:** ""Okay, I'll play this game, Let's do it."" [Application proceeds]

**CS:** ""I am pleased to tell you that your application has been successful. You have been granted a new card with a credit limit of £8,000!""

**M:** ""So let me get this straight ... I asked for a £2k increase to the limit on my existing card for a short period of time, and was declined. And yet you have just agreed to give me a brand new credit card to go with my existing one, and an extra £8k of credit. Have I got that right?""

I don't watch top gear. But if we accept that the Beebs only fair option is to treat Jeremy like any normal human being and - assuming he did punch someone - sack or severely discipline him, then who is responsible for the show not being aired?

Part of Jeremy's role, and part of the reason he gets paid so much is because he has a lot of responsibility. He has a responsibility to do his job, and not do things which might prevent that, like punching his boss (again, ""apparently"").

Those annoyed at Top Gear being cancelled should be annoyed a Jeremy, not the Beeb. He's the one who has let them down. We should be proud that our BBC is doing what everyone in society should be doing, and not treating someone as above the law because of their position, power or potential wealth.

lol

You actually seem to believe that these groups are not only known to each other, but they coordinate their efforts. Wow. Is it part of a Muslim Conspiracy? Part of that Caliphate notion?

Aside from that nonsense, how come single incident rapes *from a minority* also get brought up? The example I linked wasn't an ""abuse ring"", it was a single criminal, single victim scenario. Top comment was pointing out he was black. Face it: the sole reason for the submission was to say ""check out what this foreign devil did"". Crimes like that rarely get subbed on reddit. 

&gt; Not a day goes by we don't discuss the pedophile rings in westminister.

Because it's a HUGE story. The other many sexual abuse court cases seen DAILY by our legal system only make headlines when a) it's someone famous, b) it's a particularly heinous crime or c) they are a minority. 

And it's not just sexual abuse, a case where a black guy attacked an OAP has been covered at length on the UK reddit subs yet a far worse case where a blind, and [very obviously extremely disabled man](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-31602670) was beaten up by a white guy never got mentioned. Or another case where a couple of white ""thugs"" threw a deaf-blind OAP *[onto a fucking railway track](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-29746354)* never got mentioned. These would be covered at length if it were a black criminal.

Don't give me your bullshit about individual crimes merit for coverage. It does not fly in the slightest. This shit blatant as fuck to anyone with even half a brain. 

And WRT to westminister, their race/religion/creed never ever comes up. We never blame their ""culture"" for it. I believe this is my point here.

Their beliefs are never addressed and they go to the polls in silence. That is the problem.",null,0,null,1426104975,null,0,false,0,cpbse79,null,t3_2ynyy3,null,t1_cpbse79,null,t1_cpbpbm0,null,null,null,1427706464,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

I took my mod 1 and 2 with very little training. My mod 1 training consisted of 2 hours of touch up before my test, which was enough to pass me easily. Which was just to go over what we were doing in the test the format and everything, and minor touch ups. 

Mod2 was scheduled for 2 hours as well, but we stopped after 1 because he felt there was no point in doing the second hour. I passed that easily as well. 

So it can be done with little to no training. I really wouldn't recommend it with completely no training though, I'm 100% without the both sessions I would have failed. Its always good, regardless of how good you might be, to have a few hours with someone who knows exactly what you need to do.

As for gear.. Maybe someone else can chime in here, but from what I remember they can fail you for not wearing correct gear. Whether they do or not is completely up to the examiner and if they feel that what you're wearing is sufficient. It might be that they feel trainers and jeans is OK for a test, they also might not. Personally, I wouldn't risk it. For the cost of some cheap boots and trousers it means you don't go home disappointed before you've even got a chance to take your test. Then you've always got them for future use.

And when you take your CBT you're doing it through a school, which is why they provide you with gear.

These days offend and disagree are synonyms. 

Anyone who thinks outside of the mandated lines is something-ist or something-ism. Labels from the newspeak of the early 21st century. Oh but its all justified for this mystical and magical greater good. An imagined utopia while society slides into a dystopia of their own making. Luckily we have those still around who will still fight for our freedom and will not obey the censors.

Weak men and weak women all thinking along the lines of appeasement these days when it comes to offending people. Instead of saying ""no"" outright to someone's anger, it's cowtowing to the censor's demands instead. The only end to such cowardice is having your face stamped on by a boot forever while you plead and beg to give them whatever left you have.

Free speech is a sacred cow for a reason and I will end with a quote from Benjamin Franklin:

I also don't trust the government with data. My/my parents' details might have been on those CDs that HMRC decided to send unencrypted through normal post all those years ago.

Why suspend them?  The only reason you should have such guilty until innocent is if the claimed behaviour is likely to be an ongoing issue.

The problem is, if you have a job, which expects work hours to creep up beyond 60 a week there isn't really an outside of work any more.  Things will happen, stuff will be said.

I've lost my cool before now, whilst not physical, it most certainly counted as verbal assault.  Suspending me would not have helped matters at all, because many people, believed I was *onto something* or similar.  It was very unprofessional of me, but I was only 21, and in situation I had no control over, no experience in being under such pressure, and someone who was being actively unhelpful.  The difficult thing about that incident, is in my anger I justified everything I'd said about the competency of the person, it's hard to apologise for that, as you can't undo saying a truth.

This is why things need to be done on a case by case basis, blindly suspending someone is an over-reaction, unless you expect their behaviour to continue to be disruptive (unsafe) or against the interests of the firm.",null,0,null,1426106751,null,0,false,0,cpbtn2y,null,t3_2yo45t,null,t1_cpbtn2y,null,t1_cpbpjro,null,null,null,1427707046,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Fernando has been an utter disappoint this season for me, for what he cost he should be capable of making a forward pass without losing the ball.

We rely on silva, aguero and Toure to carry us and it's just not good enough. With any of them gone we lose too much confidence. If toure leaves at the end of this season the midfield will be compromised significantly and there's no youth that's been played enough to come into the first team.

That's a pretty good point, however, just because the EU started as a trade agreement, that doesn't mean that it can't be more than that.

&gt;An EU army would effectively be a way to give the EU control of military forces directly and used to support an aggressive land grab in Ukraine. They don't talk about the coup in Ukraine being fascist these days and nor do they talk about the democratically elected government being washed away.

What of the people in Ukraine that want to be part of the EU? From my understanding, that's pretty common in western Ukraine, after all. It doesn't seem like much of a *land grab* if Ukraine wants to join the EU.

&gt;The issues in Ukraine stem from the EU wanting to have Ukraine for itself. It's all a power play for the EU to try and carve out it's own little fief in the east and the Russian bear does not like its territory being taken from it. Russia sees Ukraine and Belarus as its own land, buffer states rather than sovereign territory. With Ukraine under EU hands, Russia has no buffer state and EU troops would then be very, very close to the heartland of Russia.

How would you differentiate between ""EU wants its own little fief"" and ""the Russian bear does not like its territory being taken from it"". Ukraine is as much in Europe as EU countries, so I don't see why it's from for the EU to want Ukraine to join but *okay* for Russia to do what it's doing. Especially when you bear in mind that Russia annexed Crimea.

Absolutely, however the BBC have handled this rather badly, because it is such a watched show, it's obvious that news of this would leak out swiftly, it isn't clear that this is an action worthy of suspension, I think that is the issue.  Either it's clear cut cross misconduct, in which case, cut him, otherwise, keep the show running, bring in a management mediator if need be (these people exist sadly to fill a need, some are very cunning) but keep the business unit functioning.

As is, it looks like an ill thought out attempt to put someone on the naughty step.  However, when you blow an incident like this out of proportion, rather than people thinking of the perpetrator as a twat, he becomes a victim.  Imagine if in my case I had pressed charges, and the guy had descended into a full nervous breakdown, hypothetically speaking, all his friends would have thought that my action, being disproportionate (because many, would feel at some level, I was a twat deserving of punching) pushed the poor 'unstable' guy into it.  Jeremy Clarkson has some clear enemies, the shit with the mirror I think shows that, when managing a situation like that, you need to make it clear that he isn't been singled out, one way or another.

All of this was known by Bevin - ""stuffed their mouths with gold"". No one has had the guts to finalise the full nationalisation of the NHS. ""You're ruining the NHS"" the BMA etc will scream and scream again. They'll march in the streets till you back down.

Bevan knew that the NHS would be inadequate, [in 1953 he said so the the nurses](http://www.nhshistory.net/shorthistory.htm)

&gt;The fundamental questions that tested Bevan and his colleagues - how best to organise and manage the service, how to fund it adequately, how to balance the often conflicting demands and expectations of patients, staff and taxpayers, how to ensure finite resources are targeted where they are most needed - continue to exist. Bevan foresaw this in speaking on 2nd June to a Royal College of Nursing conference. 'We shall never have all we need,' he said. **'Expectations will always exceed capacity. The service must always be changing, growing and improving - it must always appear inadequate.'** Increasing expenditure led to the appointment in 1953 of the Guillebaud Committee to 'enquire into the cost of the National Health Service'. The report (1956)[7] said that the committee found no opportunity for new sources of income or to reduce in a substantial degree the annual cost of the service.

Of course they want in on the Euro and the money from the EU. I wouldn't blame them. I posted recently about Ukraine having the objectively 2nd worst economy in all of Europe. Their GDP per capita is 1/3rd that of Russia's, 1/5th of the UK's and 1/8th that of Norways. They are a poor and backwards country that has everything to gain from the money being taxed from the west and sent to the east.

Ukrainians want to join the EU with a vast number of them in support because of potential economic growth.

Russia had every right to annex Crimea. The Russian language was being banned in ukraine at the time and the population of Crimea is majority Russian. A referendum conducted was almost entirely in favour of union with Russia. Never underestimate Russia's willingness to protect ethnic Russians.

Another thing is, as some people have pointed out, this is gonna bring a rise in cigarette holders/cases. And they are a hell of a lot more attractive and noticeable to kids than cigarette packing.

null,false,davie18,cnty-england,Newcastle Uni,null,"&gt;During the years 2001-2007[1] , there was a sharp rise in government spending. In real terms, government spending increased from just over £400bn (2009 prices) to £618bn in 2008-09. As a % of GDP Government spending also increased from 36% of GDP in 2000 to 46% of GDP by the end of 2008-09

I'm sorry but did you even read my comment? I specifically said Blair's first term, i.e. 1997-2001. 

Look at this graph: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/budget/9932748/Budget-2013-Britains-debt-and-deficit.html

Above the graph = good. Notice when it suddenly goes above? What you have said about spending money we didn't have literally couldn't be more incorrect when talking about Blair's first term.

Also things that happened during his first term:

- He declined the offer to join the eurozone. Find me anyone who thinks this was a bad decision.
- Introduction of the minimum wage. Now it would seem absurd not to have this. 
- Freedom of information act introduced - again something that would be absurd if it were to be revoked now. 
- The Human Rights Act
- Numerous legislation to improve the acts of gay people, including allowing them to join the armed forces and having the same legal age of consent as straight couples. Also set the wheels in motion for civil partnerships which he later passed whilst PM.
- Unemployment also reduced during this time. 
- Inequality also started to reduce during his first term. 

If you don't think our government 1997-2001 was a good government then I'm really confused as to what you think a good government is.

Original comment - 

xenophobia


noun - 
dislike of or prejudice against people from other countries.
""racism and xenophobia are steadily growing in Europe""
synonyms:	racism, racialism, racial hatred, ethnocentrism, ethnocentricity


A few examples of Clarksons xenophobia, none of which are a reflection of his views on the EU but more a reflection of his intolerance of people from other countries. Y'know like the word suggests.

null,false,Callduron,null,null,null,"Apprenticeships are in a weird place. Traditionally they were for youngsters learning a trade from a master. In modern times they have been open to all because it's a job and people are not allowed to discriminate. However both Milliband and Cameron seem geniunely unaware of this and have made references to apprenticeships being for young people. The government funding is equally ambivalent, with funding being made available if the worker is 18-24 but no requirement that the worker is actually that age. 

The short answer is apply for all of them unless they specifically state an age range but be aware that some of them, even if they didn't specify an age range so as not to discriminate, won't accept workers over 24 because then they wouldn't get the government handout. But you don't know in any specific instance until you try it.

B&amp;Q for instance is quite noted for not discriminating, I remember a story a couple of years ago about an apprentice there in his 70s. http://www.retiremove.co.uk/working-in-retirement/

null,false,Rodents210,rose,Rose,null,"&gt; Thing is, people don't cosplay for your enjoyment... they do it for themselves. 

And they willingly do it in public where they're open to public scrutiny, which they will often receive. The two are not mutually exclusive. People write novels for themselves all the time. And if they don't want scrutiny they don't lets others read them. This is common sense.

&gt; You're basically expecting someone who wants to dress in cosplay to be at such a professional level of costuming and makeup work - and the plain fact is, the majority of people who do cosplay out there aren't at that level.

I'm expecting, as I've said probably a dozen times now, $5 more effort than this, to exponentially improve the quality of the costume. This is a far cry from expecting professional quality. The fact that the cost difference between this and a quality cosplay piece is *negligible* means this cosplay is *not* a case of ""budget"" but of ""effort."" You're continually ignoring that and strawmanning me by putting words in my mouth.

&gt;  It's one thing to provide constructive criticism - provide tips on what they could do better for next time... it's another thing to just be a dick about it.

It's one thing to be supportive and praise good cosplay... it's another to adopt a ""praise at all costs,"" ""say something nice or say nothing,"" ""get offended on others' behalf"" mentality about it.",null,0,null,1426110508,null,0,false,0,cpbw5gr,null,t3_2ynl1h,null,t1_cpbw5gr,null,t1_cpbsucg,null,null,null,1427708217,null,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1,null

The sections you have copied are very poorly worded (and missing bits!).  It's hard to read without the full agreement, but basically parts 1 and 2 say that the Tenant needs to pay rent and comply with the obligations set out in the tenancy agreement, and if not, the guarantor must pay the rent and carry out the obligations/pay for any damages the landlord has incurred (which is the ""indemnity"" bit).  Part 3 is just for if the tenancy rent is increased/period extended at any time - it confirms that the bits in parts 1 and 2 aren't affected if this happens.

My father always told me, never hit someone unless you intended to kill someone, never try to kill someone unless you know you will.  It's been incredibly useful advice, thanks to him in no small part this is ingrained in my nature, it was why I never hit the guy back.

You never know when that knowledge might suddenly be worth everything.

&gt; What is keeping you busy now?

Right now, dealing with some pathetic shit between two guys who are running a satellite division of our new start up.

I probably shouldn't say such a thing on the internet, as a director, ultimately it's my fault too, but damnit, why can't they just get along.  Nothing 'bad' has happened, it's just a complete breakdown of respect, and it's creating a massive headache for us all, sadly today it's my turn to bare the brunt of it.  One doesn't trust the other to do anything, very unfairly.

Of course, this happened just as we start our next (and biggest yet) funding round.

A lot of that is definitely our (founders) fault.  Flat structure has worked so well this far because everyone has respect for peoples special skill sets, even the less glamorous ones.  Work gets divided and no one feels the need to attach themselves to something as we all know what everyones value is, heck we all know the equity structure too.  This sadly didn't translate well to our new office, rather than building the team out, it looks like we won't be keeping it together there at all.

Both people appear desperate to prove their worth.

A good lesson there, one we've learned, less relaxed, more defined roles, more top-down management of the kind I've hated in the past, but it is there for a reason I guess.

It's nearly 10pm, and I've not started the real '/u/TheAnimus work' for today yet.  Oh well, I'm nearly done with the appeasement.  People I've worked with before honestly would not believe what I've had to become.

So yeah, good advert for starting your own company!  Plus side, someone gave a valuation that is comfortably into retirement territory level today....

Tottenham: 11.7

But, we can definitely see some trends from this analysis. Mainly, Spurs and Saints have the easiest run-ins.  Spurs have more mid-table teams left...but Saints have 3 of the bottom 4 left on their schedule. For them, this is offset by having the top 2 teams in the league...which should be dropped points.  Don't know which situation is better.  

Looking at other teams, Man City also have a fairly tame finish whereas Man U have by far and away the toughest schedule among teams in contention for top 4.

null,false,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,null,"&gt; I suppose the roots of the whole issue come down to the sort of values we hold dearest in a society where the free market is king; ie personal gain over any sort of social conscience. There must be something wrong with our education system really if this remains as the primary motivation for most.

I'm not at all convinced that those are in fact the qualities that our society holds dearest.

If you grab someone at random and ask them if they value the free market *(which doesn't exist, by the way)* over...  I tell you what, let's be emotionally exploitative...  Tell them that you're shocked about Rotherham and ask them if they think society should protect these poor exploited little girls, rather than let market forces rules.  I'm gonna guess nearly no one is going to suggest it should be allowed to fall to market forces.

Ok, here's something I find interestingly perverse...  Most people are broadly ok with the idea that you're worth *(as an employee)* what an employer thinks you're worth.  A few years ago my MP suggested that disabled people should be **[allowed to work for less than minimum wage](http://m.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-13809620)**.  Well, frankly, if **you're** worth only what an employer is willing to give you, then he's right.  However, that's **not** the view of the public.  Most people found the very suggestion repugnant.

I don't have any kids, so I don't get any immediate benefit from my taxes being spent on schools.  However, I don't consider the part of my taxes the state spends on schools to be squandered, because I think education is pretty important.  Again, if you grab a few people on the streets and ask them whether they'd stop spending on education, I'd bet most of them would say no.

Shall we do the easiest one?  Practically no one is against healthcare spending.  If they were you wouldn't see every politician practically falling over themselves to promise that it must be maintained.  If I could have all the share of my tax that was spent on healthcare back and then pay for what I've actually had at BUPA rates I'd have a nice stack of cash in my hands.  On balance I'm ok with putting a bit more into healthcare that I got back.  I believe that most people would.

The people who worship the free market aren't, in my opinion, the majority.  It is the people who benefit from a rigged game.  The issue is that the people running the system rub shoulders with the people with all the money.  Maybe it's not quite bribery, but if you were an MP wouldn't you perhaps consider that if you were business friendly and if you made the right connections you might be rewarded with a nice job, if you played the game right.

&gt; do you know whether the Scandinavian countries have the same issues or do people there simply acknowledge that high taxation is a fact of life and in return they can expect high quality social services in the broadest sense of the term?

I don't know much more about the Scandinavian countries apart from what I've read.  That said, my experience is that people accept things as normal after a pretty short time.  Until maybe the early eighties people didn't seem to really think that drink driving was a terribly big deal.  A pretty good way into the eighties it was common for people to smoke at their desks in the office.  Even at the small end of things, the iPhone was released in 2007 and now everyone thinks it's normal to walk around with tiny touchscreen PCs in their pockets that would have given Captain Kirk gadget envy.

I think that normalisation is a major part of it.

On top of that, in Scandinavian countries it seems to be well accepted that the state has to be well funded and that it should provide services commensurate with that funding.  If you don't know about them, you might find it interesting to read about **[Finnish baby boxes](http://m.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22751415)**.

One point where we fail in the UK is that people don't feel like they're getting value for money in the UK when they pay taxes.  You've probably seen statistics that the government spends upwards of £10,000 per person.  I'll guess you might not feel like you're getting the value of the tax you pay, much less £10,000.

While we're here, we need to take a quick detour.

You'll no doubt have seen people claim that Scottish people get more out than they put in, due to the Barnett formula.  I'm not even going to get into the argument around oil, but there is a case for this.  However, it is really important you understand that  even when the current government claimed to have reduced the deficit what they're saying is that they're borrowing less than we were before.  They haven't gotten anywhere near paying anything back.  Even under austerity the state spends about 6% more than it 'earns'.

So, sure the Scottish get more out than they put in.  So do you.

Kinda.  I wouldn't recommend you accept those spending figures at face value.

Ok, detour over.

If you paid £1,000 in tax what the government spends it on would look a bit like this:    
£200 on pensions.  *(Of which only about £20 would be public sector pensions.)*    
£180 on healthcare.    
£150 on welfare.    
£120 on education.    
£70 on the interest on the state's debts.
£60 on defence.    
£40 on police, fire services, courts, etc.    
£30 on transport.    
*(About £50 on other stuff including government.)*

Pensions are, in my opinion, a major problem.  Unless you're at least fifty I think you might be over-optimistic to expect to get a state pension.    You might be ok paying in to pay someone else's pension, if you're sure the reciprocal arrangement will apply to you.  But if you're pouring cash in and expect to get nothing you might be a bit peevish about it.

We have a problem in the UK that many state services are under-funded, so they provide poor service.  Because the service is poor people resent paying for them.  That quickly becomes self-feeding.

This attitude is also what feeds the lust for tax avoidance in many higher earners.  ""I'm paying more than my fair share already.  I won't pay!""  Well, maybe.  But part of what they're paying for is a society where people aren't riddled with disease, where their employees are educated and generally in good health and where the poor don't literally eat the rich.

Finally on this, I'll share a quote from Elizabeth Warren *(an American politician)* that I have a fondness for:

&gt;“There is nobody in this country who got rich on their own. Nobody. You built a factory out there - good for you. But I want to be clear. You moved your goods to market on roads the rest of us paid for. You hired workers the rest of us paid to educate. You were safe in your factory because of police forces and fire forces that the rest of us paid for. You didn't have to worry that marauding bands would come and seize everything at your factory... Now look. You built a factory and it turned into something terrific or a great idea - God bless! Keep a hunk of it. But part of the underlying social contract is you take a hunk of that and pay forward for the next kid who comes along.”",null,0,null,1426111326,null,0,false,0,cpbwoi0,null,t3_2yhogb,null,t1_cpbwoi0,null,t1_cpb9m8y,null,null,null,1427708464,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

They must decide it solely on the evidence they hear in court. It is of fundamental importance that the proceedings are reported accurately and in a balanced way.  Nothing, whether by way of comment or otherwise, should be published, including by way of online commentary or social networking sites, which could run the risk of prejudicing the outcome of the proceedings.  The Coroner has the power to refer anything published to the Attorney General if, in his view, it may amount to a contempt of court.”  I add:  “This applies equally now that the Inquests have begun.

So I was 'on the side'.  I was there to help with a technology migration, that means job losses for some, new jobs for others.  I was an 'industry expert'.

The truth is we don't know nearly enough regarding JC, however, I can say whoever made this decision now has to make it gross misconduct.  They've painted themselves into a corner so to speak, suspension doesn't make up for violence at all, if he wasn't really violent, if this is overblown as say May suggests, then it is almost seen as absolving JC to let him back to work, even if he struck the guy.  If that happens, those who suspended him will have lost all credibility.

Suspending him is only required if he poses a risk.

My point is, that sometimes, violence is human nature, high stress, one or two keywords.  Have you never said something unforgivable?  I have.  I know how humans work, I can pretend, I mean how can people be so arrogant to think differently about themselves.  I'm proud that in thirty years of life I've never raised a hand to anyone, who wasn't posing a direct threat to my well being.  I'm a credit to my parents in that regard.  I'm also big, 6""4 100kg, I like hiking, long distance cycling, gym a couple of times a week but should probably lose about 5kg.  I know that I have it in me.  I know I've my 'id' my base instincts.  I also know, that when it comes to certain 'verbal triggers' it wouldn't take much to put me over the edge.  I'm probably mentally strong, I've unfortunately had to overcome things at an age few do, pain shapes you, *Du must Amboss oder Hammer Sein*.  But I know that I could still shatter, and in happening, I doubt my behaviour would be acceptable.  That doesn't mean I'm to be discarded, my positives ignored, my sentence carried out, my punishment immutable.

I'm lucky that the only time someone took me to my personal breaking point, I behaved minorly badly, that this incredibly gifted lady, chose not only to hurt me, but to do so with such personal secret information, with cuttingly accurate analysis, I broke.  I threw the contents of a glass of water over her and walked away.  For the first, and only time in my life, I didn't know what to say, my brain was a mess, I had no clear thought, I needed to do something, I was a panic, a panic worse than when I started to make piece that I was going to drown at sea (riptide).  I'm mentally strong, yet I broke.  I backup that claim with my track record of excelling in high pressure environments, I'm arrogant about how far above average I am when it comes to that kind of skill.  Yet I know, I have my breaking point.

1. I’d like to see us work it down the left hand side more or at least have Hazard shift out to the right more often. His increased presence really altered things in ET and I don’t see why we couldn’t have seen more of the same throughout regulation.
1. Courtois’ distribution really annoyed me. He is so hasty with it and often rushes to pass it out to someone when they will still be open if he takes a pause and surveys the field a moment longer. 
1. Willian was one of the few signs of life in the second half and I think playing him centrally in more scenarios could be a useful spark for the rest of the team late in matches.
1. I don’t know how many of you still read the /r/soccer match threads but it appears the new trend is for douchebags to use chelsea flair just for the game and say horribly stupid comments about the club when they are clearly not supporters. So yeah, thats fun...
1. Overall, pretty unimpressed with the tempo of our game. At home, a man up, with a ton of rest and having the advantage on the scoreline we should be 100% dictating the way of play but so often it looked like those advantages were PSGs and not ours. Whether its a lack of rotation, defending-to-win tactics or whatever I would like to see it change. Our squad’s quality is on par of the top tier european clubs but this sort of performance even had it got us thru PSG it wouldn’t fly against Bayern or Barca in their current form.
1. I would kill for a good refereeing performance in any competition right now.

Had a week to prepare, but Mourinho and the boys had no plan. Directionless, lifeless and extremely flat in a very important fixture. We have looked off the boil since the start of the calendar year. Whether its tiredness, or players feeling like they have nothing to play for because the media has crowned them champions since August, you still have to perform. In every facet and phase of the match, Chelsea were outclassed, outperformed as PSG showed they wanted it more. 

Its not in Jose's nature to press on for a big win, he is someone to sit back and hold onto what he has. While that can work against 85% of the opposition, this was one of the few times he needed to push forward. The game could have been over inside the first half, go for the jugular after the red card. Even with the crowd ushering the team on, it never happened. This is one time Jose can't blame the fans, even if they were nervous all match. 

I understand it was going to be weird, holding onto a lead for 90 minutes, but its a slim lead. All PSG needed was one chance, and the match is thrown on its head. For the majority of the match, the impetus was on us, and Chelsea never answered the call. While some may say its not the end of the world, and not to overreact, but with the PL ""wrapped up"" and no FA Cup, this is all we had to play.

I went with Vision Express and went to a London clinic. I got the more expensive option where the laser matches to the differing levels of sight you have over the surface of the eye (not technical jargon here, just trying to convey the concept).

I negotiated a way to pay it off monthly at £61.68 so don't worry if what they suggest is unaffordable, come up with your own, manageable figure.

Staff were great. The surgeon was fantastic. The procedure was over within 7 minutes from start to finish for both eyes. Your eyes are numbed with drops so you feel nothing and the great thing is your vision goes blurry so you can't see what's happening either. Also before it goes blurry, you can't focus on things that close to your face.

My advice would be not to think too much about the actual procedure if you're at all squeamish. I did my research about effectiveness, safety, how long it lasts, etc, but didn't focus on what they actually did other than getting the most accurate, up to date version.

I had to be guided on the train home by my boyfriend. When the anaesthetic wore off it was quite painful for a few hours, but not anything you can't handle. It just feels like you have grit in your eyes and makes your eyes water and blink a lot.

I wore eye protectors at night for a week, had eye drops for lubrication and antibiotic eyedrops too. My eyes were very red. You go round looking like a zombie for a couple of weeks but it doesnt hurt.

I could SEE straight after the surgery. When I woke up the next morning I looked at the mirrored wardobe at the end of my bed and could see my own face!! Showering was easy seeing what I was doing. Then for months when I'd set off for work I'd think oh! Ive forgotten my glasses, but no! Everything was crystal clear! My vision was better than 20/20 so i could see everything. It was mad. I kept going to push my glasses up my nose and just poking my face. No more prescription sunglasses. I can just buy any I want.

I am still amazed with it. Five years on its still amazing to me.

If you feel comfortable with the risks, then focus on the benefits instead and go for it. The best way to get the info is to book a consultation with them which should be free, no obligation. They want to sign you up, but at the same time they will be up front if youre not a suitable candidate. 

My sight has gone to 20/20 vision so I suppose theres room for it to deteriorate further over time, but I'm 30 this year with 20/20 vision so it is unlikely to deteriorate much until i get natural age related long sightedness. Also, they should have a clause or agreement that theyd give you top up surgery if you prescription deteriorated.

That's not going to happen. At the moment only about 6% of NHS work is carried out by private suppliers, according to the Department of Health.

The concern is more about longer term trends.

[Last year, private suppliers won 70% of new NHS contracts.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-25660555)

The Health and Social Care Act 2012 gives private sector providers more scope to bid for NHS services. Private sector providers can complain to the co-operation and competition panel about low public sector bids for NHS services.

It's been alleged that EU competition regulations and the proposed TTIP make it harder to resist private sector bids and harder for a future government to revert the Health and Social Care Act 2012. I don't know for sure if this is the case though.

There needs to be a big change in the way we play hopefully losing at home to 10 men showed that. Whats the point of having such a good team if you limit their flair?

The football fan in me was embarrassed for chelsea, and really wanted PSG to score a goal at 0-0 to punish such meek, uncreative play against 10 men. 

The Chelsea fan just wanted us to go through, learn our lesson, and then put it all behind us.

&amp;nbsp;

This season has really run off the rails. I don't want to hear that winning the league is a fantastic achievement. Every contender in the Prem. was in a shambles early season, and we went out to a deserved lead. From then on we have been unimpressive, merely treading water as the others improve their game but are either too far behind to matter or too sporadic match to match.

If we win the league this season it will be satisfying to an extent but, as /u/wisdompeanuts said,  does not stand in the same esteem as our previous titles.

&amp;nbsp;

**On our trophies**


Out embarrassingly in the FA

A win yes in the COC, but it's the least important and we were hardly mercurial against lesser opponents.

Out embarrassingly in the CL

?? Premier League ??

**On our players and gameplay**


Fabregas has lost his sparkle lately. 

Hazard is our best attacking player by a country mile.

It remains to be seen with Cuadrado, but Chelsea really need another properly lethal offensive player

Starting a new venture for me was more of a *lifestyle* thing than anything else.  I never took a gap year, I was working in the city weeks before I'd even graduated (I was in desperate need of money), and as such a few years back I decided to try and make up for that, I travelled a little bit, got a taste for it.  I realised I couldn't face working in the big company environment much longer, regardless of if I was good at it, I felt like a caged bird.  Simultaneously I'd become accustomed to the life afforded by such work.

Then, via an old boss of mine, I met someone who needed someone almost exactly like me.  He had the sales, the contacts to raise money, but needed a strong technologist.  We had a good skill overlap, complementing each others deficiencies, we had some hobbies in common too, which always helps.  We added another person to the mix, someone who has an attention to detail, who will just roll his sleeves up and do the paperwork I'd never get round to, who has the legal experience, who balances out our strong personalities so much so he actually sits in the middle of us!

So just like that we were off.  Well almost, we spent about 9 months planning, attempting to validate the concept, as best we could, before we went all in.

As to why they can't switch it off, I worry this was our fault.  We didn't set roles or expectations, we never thought they'd feel in competition with each other, we thought they'd just divide the work evenly, but instead, insecurities have manifested in strange ways, maybe we didn't love them enough, maybe if we'd made it clear they were important to us, we had a long term vision that included them.  Time zones divide teams, disrupts shared values, ethos, and in this case I fear we allowed things to get beyond the point of no return for one of them.

Best advice I can say is if you do find some people who you can work with, do consider it.  For it's warts, the lack of money, the stress, the 'children', it's been one hell of an interesting ride for me, and if it all goes wrong, there's always a city waiting for another meaningless cog in the machine.",null,0,null,1426113954,null,0,false,0,cpbydus,null,t3_2yo45t,null,t1_cpbydus,null,t1_cpbxf30,null,null,null,1427709259,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Fabregas would be a lot better if our team came out with the intent to have possession and attack when we do. he cant do everything when we are barely winning the ball back, part of having a playmaker like him is having a team confident enough to commit to keeping the ball and commit to attack. what use is he when there are only 2 people up front at times for him to try and pass to? the tactics are hugely flawed and theyve showed up big time today, they always were a problem hopefully today is the last straw. these types of wins matter in the league because its a completely different type of tournament (one of endurance) when you play in the champions league it boils down to how you play on one or two nights and you need to be playing very high football. thats why city cant do fuck all apart from getting bailed out by Aguero, they are good enough to win the league but at their peak they cannot compete with Europes best. we play better football and we can but you need to instil that type of play into a team especially for matches like this. it comes with time and actually going for it in these matches.",null,0,null,1426114112,null,0,1426114407,0,cpbyhfo,null,t3_2yqajk,null,t1_cpbyhfo,null,t1_cpbycvg,null,null,null,1427709306,null,8,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,8,null

Maybe it worked in 2004-2006, but it was this type of play and results that got him fired the first time around. 

There is absolutely no way that you can only blame the players for this result, while yes, they did not put away their chances, they didn't create many to begin with.

I'm not saying the tactics were flawless, but they would have worked fine had they players stepped up. The players, they were the real problem. This has been an issue that I have been seeing for months now. We get by in games winning by a goal or two because the players put in just enough effort to get something out of the game. They are lazy. Yes, they are all top class, but they play down to a B team level when they put so little care into a match. Because they are so talented they have been getting away with leaning on their talent, but when they are matched with teams that actually care *and* have talent, then they fall short. At one point tonight, the *entire* team was walking!  Maybe the players are tired, maybe they are over confident, it is hard to tell what exactly is at the heart of this issue.

null,false,grollcool,null,null,null,"I never said it was him, just that over the last 2 years there has been a clear change in their mentality.

This probably is because of Jose though. His tactics, his training mentality, his defensive attitude that he instills in them. Everything that they have gone through in training as players for the last 2 years has been under the direction of Mourinho. So good or bad, their change as players can definitely be attributed to him.

He obviously isn't telling them to not attack or play final balls. But as as someone who has played in the past, I know for a fact the amount of defensive responsibility and attacking freedom a coach gives you directly affects how you play. Its clear that under the likes of RDM for example, he gave them license to attack as much as they wanted, and little to no defensive responsibility. This obviosuly had its postivies as well as its faults. However, Mourinho has gone the complete other way, making Hazard and Oscar in to truly effective box to box players who attack *and* defend as far as their own goalbox at times. 

Now players do not have unlimited energy and stamina, they all have *x* amount of stamina. If you can use nearly all of your *x* energy towards attacking you are astoundingly more effective in attack. But the more of your *x* energy is given towards defending the less you have to attack, and this not only physically fatigues the player, but also mentally as well. If a player is constantly running back and forth on both ends of the field, as Mourinho wants Oscar and Hazard to do, their minds are constantly at play, it is *that* much harder for them to spot the killer pass or to create the next big play. That is why Mata couldn't fit in at Chelsea, his *x* amount of energy was not enough to handle doing both the defensive side and the attacking side, and consequently he played poorly. Now Hazard and Oscar clearly have more energy and athleticism than Mata to be able to do both jobs, but it obviously comes at a cost. No tactics or mentalities in football come without costs, and this is no different.

Any former player will be able to tell you of this type of experience. The more you work on the pitch, the less sharp you become. You can even still be able to physically handle the running and constant work across the pitch, but your mind will lag like a second longer behind you and the play.",null,0,null,1426117850,null,0,false,0,cpc06dp,null,t3_2yqajk,null,t1_cpc06dp,null,t1_cpbzr85,null,null,null,1427710166,null,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3,null

null,false,icendoan,null,null,null,"First of all, I must state that I claim no especial understanding in this area. I've had brief experience with traders, but I can't really claim to know why they do what they do.

Premium bonds are one mechanism for governments to sell bonds to citizens. It's certainly not the only one. An idea of a lottery is attractive to citizens (somehow) and thus they manage to get adequate purchase through them.

As for how they are traded: when a bond is issued, it is given a term and interest rate, and this corresponds the governments *perceptions* of it's need for money at the time. It may turn out, through circumstance or prescience that the need for cash was different to the evaluation of the government at the time at which they issued the bond. These different conditions necessitate a different price; if it turns out that the government didn't actually need that much money, then there will naturally be a surplus of required debt and the price of bonds will (naively) go down. On the other hand, if the government is in more dire a strait than they thought, then the bond will be too cheap and it's traded value (very different from the value it was initially bought at) will go up. The trade on government bonds is essentially the trade of understanding these circumstances. When someone sells a bond, they sell at the current market rate: that is (very approximately) the value of holding value in that government against other market prices. When the market expects that there will be a greater need for capital worldwide, but not for the issuing government, they can expect that the price will increase (as the risk of investing in other governments increases). Importantly, the actual monetary value and interest rate of the actual bond pays only tangential value to the actual price of that bond in the market. It is the trade of the current price for that bond against the raw monetary value that gains or loses the trader money.

There are of course many many different factors in pricing sovereign debt; market confidence in that nation is one of many different factors in the price that is very difficult to estimate or reason about.

If it's easier to think about, it is somewhat analogous to trading various currencies. When I sell a pound and buy a dollar, it is because I am willing to believe that the price of the pound with respect to the dollar with fall. If and when it does, I will then rebuy my pound, and pocket the difference in price. This is the same as trading government debts, except there are more parameters than current value to trade. In particular, I would be trading against the value I expect the pound to have at the time the bond is required to be paid.

I've realised that I've not really answered your question: who owes what money. It should be clear that the money comes from the populace willing to buy (either to trade or to not) government bonds. As for who owes what money, it depends upon the financial instrument used in the trade of said bond; you can either trade this bond wholesale, or trade a promise to pay a loss on that bond (for a premium now - think of insurance) when it comes to term. Either of these things may be mispriced at the time they are sold, and as such traders may understand that they can make a profit by selling it for the correct price right now.

The monetary portion of a bond is owed to whomever holds the bond at the time when it comes to term - trading occurs when the perceived value of that bond is different to the value of the money which will be paid when it expires.

You mention the NHS particularly. That is already the most comprehensive database of living UK people. It was created on the understanding that there would be no 'function creep'. It is not clear to me how joining it with DWP and tax information would improve health care? GP and hospital records benefit from data-sharing of course, but this is already happening without ID cards being required.

Joining DWP, LA benefits, and employment records seems more promising, and in fact Iain Duncan Smith is trying to move towards this with his Universal Credit. It's really problematic on the IT side though, they just can't seem to get it together. In addition to their capability problem, there are many difficult exceptions to consider, such as self-employed people. You only need a few people working, but not recorded as working to make the idea of automatic JSA payment unsafe.

* Prevention of future conflicts. Europe is responsible for what are generally regarded as the two darkest periods of mankind's history, World War 1 and 2. I'm for anything that brings people together and perhaps stops such things ever happening together.

Old rail can still find use in low-traffic areas such as sidings, so it is often left to accumulate so that a train can go through every couple of years to collect the used rail and sort it for scrap or other uses. They need to be infrequent so that they don't tie up the line with work possessions and thus close the line to all traffic more often.

It's not about losing, because no matter how you play you're always going to lose somewhere, but it's about how. Why are we playing beautiful football 90% of the games against weaker teams, but then we decide to play negative against big teams and it's cost us the win the majority of the time. Is it so fucking bad that I want to see my team play like the potential we have? We do need a change in mentality when it comes to big games because we're just wasting the collective talent and ability of the team when we play in a way that doesn't use them. Our attackers look dreadful when we play this way. I'd rather we go into every game with the mindset that we're going to bring the game to the opponent and put pressure on them to occasionally lose knowing our team did our best, rather than try to forever play so unnecessarily negative to scrap by and look like we're lucky every time the opponent doesn't win. I hate that we have so much talent but play like we're always down 10 as a newly-promoted Championship side.

I love Mourinho and all, but this is not a kneejerk overreaction like you're implying it is and how people are failing to see the big picture.

The customer charter states 3 mins or 5 mins in busy times. The submitted article seems to corroborate,  in tips 1 and 8, that there is an accepted time limit for the penalties to apply. There would have to be anyway, or there would *never* be any basis for appeal, as tickets are always available eventually, even if days later.

&gt;Open ticket offices trump ticket machines as they can accept any form of payment, generally

That certainly makes sense, but there was no ticket office there. I had cash and a debit card but the machines weren't working at all. The nearest ticket office is a considerable distance away, through the tube station, which I had tapped-out of on my Oystercard. I didn't know it was there. If I had gone there I would certainly have missed my train, which wouldn't have been a reasonable outcome. I would have left a female friend waiting alone at night for 30-60 minutes, and missed the point of my trip. That's not a good outcome for a regular traveler who always pays his fare in normal circumstances, and who attempts to pay at his first opportunity, even when he could have just walked out of the station. 

It all turns on whether I had 'sufficient opportunity' to buy a ticket. If tickets were already 'available' in that interchange between the stations, then why have they installed ticket machines there? Should I have been given an opportunity at the destination? I'd say yes.

I said all this to the appeal, but just got a crap standard response. I think they should at least consider the points I am making, but they haven't. I don't think that is too much to ask.

Anyway, it can be avoided if you are aware of your rights, so I hope this post helps someone.

Unfortunately as the poor hold very few assets they don't benefit as much, and as its dangerous to go straight into printing to finance spending QE is the cheat we use instead.

If it makes you feel any better, we did do it indirectly so some of the QE funds went to decreasing the debt, and subsequently causing less austerity.

what's more, even those we gamble on who do succeed, such as modric or berbatov, will only see us a springboard to greater success elsewhere.i fear that eriksen may fall into this category as well. 

what we have with mason is someone who is playing his life out for the shirt, as is said often, but as is said less often, he's a very decent player who is keeping out more experienced and bigger named players by merit, and who has room to improve and is already improving. 

let's not forget, everyone says we need to give lamela time as it's his first season in the league - same is true of mason and he has been contributing more than lamela.

the way i see it, the more young players that get a chance the better. it does wonders for the morale of our fans and gives hope and drive to the next youngsters in line, onomah spoke about it after his 1st team appearance. it's alluring to other young players globally that we want to attract, and it instills a sense of loyalty in the club that we have lacked in recent years.

for every kane there may be a few caulkers, livermores, and o'haras but we'll never know till we try - who knows where mason will end up but he's already more than earned a chance in my book. if he moves on at some point, the club will turn a profit. if he stays, he could end up becoming an important part of the team.

last but not least he's also our cutest player that's got to count for something #teamryan #sorrydolphin

NTL is just a transfer into the new passport, there is no decision to be made.

You need to carry both your old and new passports when travelling. The only reason to do the NTL application is if you have trouble carrying two small booklets, or if you want to change your name, or if you are rich.

(Strictly speaking, if your intention was to remain outside the UK when you left in 2012, then your ILE expired at that time, but then you were readmitted in 2014 under the ILE so it is OK. Even if you were outside the UK for more than 730 days, it appears that the officer reactivated it when granting you entry in 2014. In fact, if you apply for the NTL then they may look into your absence from the UK when examining whether your ILE is still valid, and ask more questions.)",null,0,null,1426125834,null,0,false,0,cpc4nfj,null,t3_2yl80v,null,t1_cpc4nfj,null,t3_2yl80v,null,null,null,1427712253,null,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1,null

Divide this number into the total number who died from terrorism during this period. It's a very small fraction. Something like 1/500.

If we were rational, we would be about 500 times more concerned about homicide in its ordinary, everyday form, than we are about terrorism.

Its sad to see Carragher stooping to such rhetoric. Verratti should not have even been playing today. Cavani should've been sent off for a 2nd yellow. We should've had a clear penalty on Costa... Did we surround the ref when those incidents occurred? Way to cherry pick your bullshit, Jamie.

As a smoker who has bought plenty of cigs brought in from abroad in my time, you ALWAYS know when you're buying cigs that have been imported illegally. 

The point being that, if you're buying something you know has been brought in from abroad and it's in plain packaging, you know full well that it's dodgy and counterfeit. Other countries aren't enforcing plain packaging yet so anything brought in from abroad SHOULD have the proper branded packaging.

10-20 years down the line it could be a problem because British smokers won't know what the foreign branded packaging *should* look like anymore, so they won't be able to tell the difference between a legit pack and a fake pack, but in the short term it makes it easier for smokers to spot the fakes or changes nothing.
