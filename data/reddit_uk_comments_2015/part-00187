&gt;jaffa cakes crossed out

Jaffa Cakes aren't biscuits. That was decided in a bloody court of law.

&gt;but you've added mince pies, Weetabix and Oreos!??

1. I'd consider mince pies to be more biscuit-like than pie-like, because they're so small.

2. Weetabix has a question mark next to it, because nobody would ever eat a plain Weetabix without milk.

3. I quite like Oreos, and many other people do, or else they wouldn't sell them here.

&gt;I'm shocked and appalled that you added more non-biscuits and a revolting foreign biscuit brand (not even a type, a brand)

I added more ""non-biscuits"" to widen it up. The ""non-biscuits"" are still biscuit-like. It's not like I've added a cabbage, have I?

Oreos are a biscuit brand. But, do you know what other biscuits are trademarked brands? 

Hobnobs, Crunch Creams, Nice, Penguins, Hovis, Tunnock's Teacake/Caramel

&gt;You even called the savoury scone ""American Biscuit"".

That's because that's what it is. The Americans call it a biscuit, so if any Americans are in this subreddit, they can have something to relate to other than an Oreo or a chocolate chip cookie.

As far as I can tell his position isn't under any threat, and after one full season, a crop of players that were not the managers choice and therefore the squad was and still is forming, and a top 7 finish in the most competitive league in Europe, any thoughts otherwise would be absurd. 



Good point about player power at the club though. It's something that does need to be addressed and hopefully will be, with some of the supposed culprits of negativity in the dressing room being moved on this summer.

Public Spending is not why the economy crashed; Austerity is an ideological attack on on public services worldwide; it is a condition of the ECB and IMF. It is about transferring public wealth into private hands. So whether or not a hypothetical united Ireland had more or less cuts depends on the stance taken by politicians at the time; austerity is not inevitable but ideological.

null,false,rnessy,null,null,null,"To further, these attacking runs are essential because it stretches the opposition's back line, and in turn gives our midfielders room to maneuver. Our offense relies on a striker who can do this and speedy, intelligent players are the ones that do it best. Balo doesn't make the right runs, lambert lacks the pace, and borini just isn't good enough. That's why missing a suitable striker has been so disastrous, their movement is essential. Starting from the back line, not in a counter attack, we try to do something similar to Barcelona with Xavi; we play it up to a deeper lying midfielder (Gerrard last season and Allen this season) and that draws a defender to him, this opens up a pocket of space in the middle, we play along the back line and the midfielder until we have enough space to move the attack further forward. Without CBs that can pass and a GK as well, we lose a lot of our ability to start from the back. This is why Migs, for how excellent of a shot stopper he is, does not fit well with the system, skrtel as well, they're not ball playing defenders. There's two ways that I know of that works in getting around teams that park the bus. These are switching the play from one side to the other fast enough to catch them out, and also being very technical with give and goes around the box to make space - Barcelona are the experts with this. When I watch us try to attack teams that park the bus, we are either not surgical enough with our passing, or simply too slow, that's up to Rodgers to solve. 
While I'm at it, the comment I'm replying to is right in that our defense relies on pressing, but you didn't emphasize that it needs to start at the striker. If we let them pass around comfortably from the back, their possession in the midfield isn't as sloppy and hurried and our pressing game there suffers. That's again why balo and lambert don't fit, borini in this regard is our best option but he is absent going forward. You did mention Henderson was more of a presser than Allen, I'd argue the opposite, Allen earns his spot through relentless pressing and reliably recycling possession with the defense as I mentioned earlier. Hendo earns his spot by, of course helping in pressing, but also seeing the spaces the attackers' runs open up and getting into that open space, without someone to utilize the open space beyond just our attacking midfielder, we lose an important point of our attack. 
I got more, Gerrard was good last season because he could pick out the open space/player I just spoke of and play it there, this season the opposition assigned a runner to him and made it so he didn't have the time he needed to play an accurate ball, hence the poor attacking form. Defensively his pressing game has suffered this season just because of age. He's an amazing player but Rodgers was really struggling with how to play him this season.

A quick run down on our most used players,I tend to get carried away with these so sorry if it's very long .


Goalkeeper - Craig Gordon
Former Hearts and Sunderland player(Most expensive British goalkeeper ever), this is his first season with us after he was a free agent for 2 years following a string of injuries. He had a huge gap to fill when our last keeper left but has done the job incredibly and many consider him one of our best additions in years(More so because he cost absolutely nothing)

Defence:
Emilio Izaguirre(Izzy)- You might know him from the Gold cup, Honduras international and our most used player(57 starts this season). He joined from Motagua after an impressive world cup in 2010 and the only time he's been out of the team was when he broke his ankle.

Virgil Van Dijk- The best centre back the club has seen in about 10 years, incredibly good at attacking(10 goals this season) and the best player in the squad atm. He's not likely to be at the club much longer unfortunately, tipped to move on to the BPL for Â£10mil+ but there is hope if we get into the champions league he might stay.

Jason Denayer-Another quality centre back that has chipped in with goals(He's like a clone of Van Dijk), on loan from Manchester City. Again not likely to be here next season with City favouring a loan to an English club :(

Efe Ambrose- Centre back or Right back. Nigerian International, he is a bit of a legend amongst supporters because he isn't the best footballer but he always tries and has a smile on his face even when things are going hopelessly wrong. Get's blamed a lot for our mistakes but he's actually very good at times and has been solid lately

Adam Matthews- Right back. Welsh international, joined from Cardiff for free, was once considered to be very promising but his development has stagnated and he's injured quite a bit. Does the job and could still become quite a player.

Mikael Lustig- Swedish international. Right back, has had a very injury prone season but when he's fit he is one of our best players. Not the fastest but he does his job brilliantly. Has been known to chip in with some goals and also provide cover at centre back if we have injury troubles.

Charlie Mulgrew- Plays anywhere on the left. Scottish international, missed this whole season through injury. He is the best crosser of the ball we have and is deadly from set pieces. Known to chip in with some goals throughout the season.

Youths with little experience in the first team-Darnell Fisher, Kieran Tierney

Midfielders:

Scott Brown(Broony)-Centre mid. Celtic and Scotland captain, our longest serving player and the heart of our team. A Celtic team without Scott Brown in the midfield is a very weak one. He is a very loyal servant and loved by every Celtic supporter.

Kris Commons- Attacking mid.Retired Scottish international that was born in England. Our best goalscoring midfielder, outscored our strikers last year and has been a great addition to the team since he joined from Derby. Hasn't been as good this season but still scored big goals. Known for being quite slow and is often called fat even though he isn't.

Stefan Johansen-Centre mid. Norwegian International. Joined midway through last season from Stromsgodset(The team our manager Ronny Deila came from).Had a poor start to the season when he was played out of position but he turned it around and was awarded player of the year for both Celtic and the SPFL. Great passer of the ball and has been the main reason Kris Commons hasn't featured as much as he used to.

James Forrest(Shooders- because he runs like a hunchback)-Right midfielder. Scottish international. Much like Matthews he was considered one of the most promising footballers when he broke through but hasn't reached his potential. A very good squad player but often injured. He scored one of the most important goals for us in recent years to beat Shaktar Karagandy and seal Champions league qualification.

Gary Mackay-Steven - Attacking midfielder- Recently joined from Dundee Utd along with Stuart Armstrong. Had quite a debut scoring within seconds and has been solid since then putting in great performances in the league.He is an exceptional dribbler of the ball and the best we've had since Aiden McGeady.

Stuart Armstrong-Centre mid. Bought from Dundee United this season, has been solid and provided goals from the midfield. Scored on his league debut and also had a dream European debut against Inter Milan where he scored one and forced an own goal from Inter to start a Celtic comeback.

Nir Bitton- Defensive mid. Isreali international. Had a very limited first season with us where he was quite hit or miss but this season he has stepped up and become a great addition to the squad, his passing and defensive play is developing quite well and he is missed in big games when he doesn't feature.

Young players in the team- Liam Henderson, Callum McGregor.
Others who are signed but never play- Aleksandar Tonev(Accused of racially abusing an opposition player whilst playing for us), Mubarak Wakaso, Derk Boerrigter and Tom Rogic

Strikers:

Leigh Griffiths. Joined from Wolves after an amazing season on loan at Hibernian. Didn't look to be part of the managers plans at the start of the season but forced his way into the team by playing amazingly every chance he got. Is our top scorer and the only striker that has been given a real chance in the second half of the season.

John Guidetti- Swedish international. On loan from Man city, had an amazing start to the season but his formed has dipped severely. Dropped a few months ago because Griffiths was outperforming him. Still loved by the supporters for his remarks about our rivals and his great last minute goal vs Inter Milan.

Stefan Scepovic-Serbian International. Just joined from the Spanish second division for between 2 and 3 million pounds. Wasn't welcomed well by fans because he tried to call the move off when he got offers from elsewhere but then signed when the other deal fell through. Has gotten barely any consistent game time and when he has gotten on the pitch nobody passes to him. Not gonna be here long in my opinion.

Anthony Stokes- Irish International, playing here a while now, usually averages 20 goals and 10 assists a season but has been poor since his strike partner Gary Hooper left for Norwich. Moved to a wide position at times this season because his finishing has been poor. Very controversial player, is currently on trial for assault and has gotten into trouble for attending the funeral of a known IRA member.

You can watch most games on streaming websites if you don't want to pay, some american sports channels actually show our games but not every week.

If you want to guarantee a legal stream of every home game you could subscribe to [Celtic TV](http://www.celticfc.tv/) it charges a yearly fee of about 60 Dollars I believe(Might be wrong, emailing them about their packages might be a good idea if you plan on subscribing).

Sixth form colleges are notoriously underfunded and integrated sixth forms tend to have a lot of stress on a maths department as it is.

Also, because further maths is mostly optional modules, it can be difficult to get an entire class to agree on a set of modules to do, that the teacher can teach in the allotted time. My sixth form has taken the ""do a little bit of everything"" approach - which is great for generalists, but not so great for anyone who needs a deep understanding of a particular area. There's a girl in my class who is set on doing physics at an excellent university, so she's self-teaching Mechanics 3-5. Meanwhile, I need to know as much pure maths as I can to pass Cambridge's maths entrance exam, so I'm self-teaching a pure module or two. A couple of the computer science guys self-taught the Decision 2 module in Year 12 to get themselves ahead. It would be quite difficult and expensive to cater to all of the possible options.

Of course he has repaid, Brendan was forced into adding him to the squad and he repaid with his performances which were a decent part of why we finished 2nd last season.

I don't understand this loyalty nonsense, why should he sign a 5 year contract (which would take him to half way through his career) just because a manager has played him a lot? If anything Rodgers has played the kid TOO much and mismanaged him horribly by putting so much pressure on him.

He would have gotten game time at many other clubs in the Prem, just not as much as he has received here. A 19/20 year old doesn't need to play 60 games a season, that's unhealthy.

Lots of comments on /topgear and /ukbike, and your comment history leads me to believe you are not just a genuine motoring &amp; cycling enthusiast. And yes, I agree that covering an HGV with spinning spikes would deter cyclists from riding so close, or attempting to overtake in tight spaces,  although I don't think that's the best way of dealing with the shared space issue. 

You post here as if you are just curious, as you did in /ukbike but you seem more interested in dragging people into an argument you have had before. You commented ""Also anything that gets the bikes out of the way so motor vehicles can drive at a proper speed safely will be welcomed by all motorists."" Probably true, and I would love a comprehensive, fully segregated and properly maintained network of roads just for bicycles, as I would imagine you would like one just for HGVs.

. Cuadrado is getting better. Slowly, but settling in a bit more.

On top of all of that, you still vote per constituency. The 5% restriction is on the national vote only. So SNP would still have won every constituency vote in Scotland (for example).

And on top of all of that, the constituency winner doesn't need to be won using FPTP. You can use any single winner voting system (of which many are very good, whereas there are limits to how good multi-winner systems are).

###Raheem Sterling: Liverpool player 'to tell club he wants to leave'

By Ben Smith

BBC Sport

Raheem Sterling is expected to tell Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers that he wants to leave Anfield this summer.

The England forward has already turned down a new Â£100,000-a-week contract, and denied being a ""money-grabber"" in a BBC Sport interview last month.

**Sterling is due to meet Rodgers and Reds chief executive Ian Ayre on Friday, when he is set to tell them he wants to be sold.**

The club are determined to keep the 21-year-old, whose contract ends in 2017.

Should he be made available, Manchester City remain the frontrunners for his signature but Arsenal and a number of leading European clubs have also expressed an interest.

While Liverpool insist they will not sell for any price this summer, their resolve may be tested by an offer in the region of Â£35m.

BBC Sport has learnt Sterling raised the subject of his future with Rodgers before the 1-1 draw with Chelsea on 10 May.

Sterling - whose current contract is worth Â£35,000 a week - said in an interview on 1 April that he ""talks about winning trophies"" rather than money.

Liverpool's last piece of silverware came in 2012, when they won the League Cup, and they have missed out on Champions League qualification for next season.

Former Reds defender and BBC Sport pundit Mark Lawrenson said Sterling had put himself ""under pressure"" with his comments.

Speaking on Friday, captain Steven Gerrard told Sterling to stay and play for a coach who ""believes in him"".

""I think there is no one better for him than Brendan Rodgers,"" said Gerrard, who will join MLS side LA Galaxy this summer after 17 years at Anfield.

""The danger for younger players is they want it all too soon and go to another club and just become a number.""

**Liverpool declined to comment.**

Donât get me wrong; /u/Kellth15âs intentions are probably entirely honourable - right now. But in the coming days, weeks, months and years itâs likely that the once peaceful and [charismatic](http://www.reddit.com/r/Kellth/comments/34txmu/hey_kev/) leader will adopt an increasingly pessimistic outlook on life. 

No longer shall the Supreme One take the time to [give encouragement to lowly wallpaper makers](http://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/366xzd/reinhardt_wallpaper_1920x1080/crbabx7) or publicly declare [optimism for the future.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/304mry/macree_belt_is_fitting_dont_you_think/cpp1dgh)

Eventually, the dream of a utopian planet (where we all hold hands and sing [happy songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJXPTnPmm78)) will die and the totalitarianism will take hold. At this point some of The Dark Lord Darth Kellth15âs [more controversial opinions](http://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/27jr41/life_is_so_beautiful/ci1p3ct) will begin to influence policy and abortion will be made illegal. 

The substantial reduction in foetuses available to the public will, in turn, result in Chinese Takeaways going back to using cats. This will cause the rat population to skyrocket and before you know it [rodents](http://i.giphy.com/ubyFR0Ykyv5u0.gif) will be the dominant species on the planet.

This is a really long question and I am not sure if its just a thinly veiled request for fishscale cocaine or if your looking for directions for a fishmonger**?** Anyway, there is a **sushi** place on princes street although I have never been in there as the appeal of raw fish is unheeded.

Find the nearest 'chippy' (ask a local for directions!) and make sure you order a doner kebab special, extra sauce and veg. Bag of chips with chippy sauce and a can of irn bru. Proceed to eat this traditional scottish meal.

As I see it a small blip in spending which caused a short lived deficit of 3% is neither here nor there. It was probably a bit excessive but in the grand scheme of things when debt was and is so cheap it was no big deal. (On the subject of borrowing, I'm much more exercised by PFI.)

You may or may not agree with this, but IMO some of the spending (especially tax credits) was a vain attempt to patch up the seamy underside of the neoliberal economy they supported so enthusiastically. We really are going to need to work out what to do with a huge number of unskilled workers whose labour can't generate enough value to support themselves.

That was when Ukraine had a pro-Western government that wanted to join NATO. They openly talked about kicking the Russians out and tried to make life difficult for them. The locals got pissed off and did what they could to hinder their government and their own armed forces. The Russians soldiers and sailors eventually just ignored the Ukraine. Ukrainian nationalists got paranoid that Russia wanted to annex the peninsula. Pro-Russian Ukrainians eased tension by removing the stupid restrictions Ukraine put on the Russians. They also signed a new lease with Russia.

Anybody who thought the Maidan coup that happened was going to end well shouldn't be listened to. It was obvious what was going to happen when even more radical nationalists get into power. Crimeans have always wanted to leave, only this time Russia was willing to take them.

Georgia was even easier. Sakashvili attacked and shelled South Ossetia on the opening night of the Beijing Olympics. For some stupid reason he thought Russia wouldn't respond. Even after his troops killed Russian peacekeepers and sent thousands of civilians fleeing into Russia or huddling in their basements. The Russians were always going to respond.

The lesson from these two wars is that stupid idiots cause stupid wars. If the Ukrainian nationalists didn't openly hate Russia so much, break the agreement they signed, chase the elected President while his term was up  and banned the Russian language, yeah Ukraine would be in a much better situation. If Georgia didn't start a war that even the EU, OSCE and the UN blames them for then they wouldn't have been attacked.

BR's words directly made a huge impact on this portrayal of Sterling, and that specifically is at least in part BR's fault because he's the one who said it.

Bills limiting [abortion, euthanasia and embryology](http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/mp.php?mpn=Tim_Farron&amp;mpc=Westmorland_and_Lonsdale&amp;house=commons&amp;dmp=813) are something he voted for, more often than not (he was 69% against these issues according to the public whip).

There's also the issue of him [abstaining from the third reading of the gay marriage bill](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/17/tim-farron-regrets-abstention-gay-marriage-vote). He now regrets it, but at the time he didn't vote for it because he feared for religious minorities.

Well you wouldn't would you, you were trying to score a cheap political point at the time hoping no one would pick it apart.

&gt; It's not like you severely understated the total amount of money the UK gave to Ireland or anything.

Officially the UK gave 7bn as part of the International Rescue Package which was part of a considerably larger pot of [Â£77bn](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/nov/22/ireland-bailout-uk-lends-seven-billion) (My earlier figure was wrong, confusion between Euro and Stirling). Additional monies have amounted in total to 14bn, the additional money clearing up the toxic debts of RBS and Lloyds which operated in the south. Most Notably the RBS subsidiary Ulster Bank, which comprised quite a large chunk of the loss suffered during the [economic crash.](http://leftfootforward.org/2014/02/rbs-the-accidental-british-bailout-of-the-irish-state/)

&gt; Todayâs RBS results mean that a tiny bank at the edge of the RBS group â Ulster Bank â is responsible for the lionâs share of RBSâs losses. This enormous loss from bad lending in Ireland means that RBS has also been the vehicle for an unintended British bailout of the Irish state.
&gt; 
&gt; With losses of Â£4.5bn last year, Ulster Bank was the largest contributor to todayâs announcement of RBSâs Â£8.2 bn of losses. It is also the black hole for the majority of RBSâs losses since nationalisation. Losing money every year, it has racked up an eye watering Â£16.6 bn of losses (operating losses plus non-core impairments), a number that exceeds the often-reported Â£14 bn taxpayersâ paper losses.

That's one tiny Bank on a tiny island on the edge of Europe.

It's easier for fraud to take place, because a person you trust, could vote a different way to how they promised.

It disfranchises lots of legitimate voters, for only a perceived problem.

Not everybody works close to their polling station, there are plenty of shift patterns that could make it very difficult and that's ignoring that work often involves travel.

&gt;If somebody is an expat and hasn't got anybody in the country they could nominate as a proxy then why are they voting anyway

Because, it's their goddamn right to!

&gt;Postal voting is a solution looking for a problem, and manages to just cause more openings for fraud.

Make sure that they understand you need to build up a credit history. Follow their advice and hopefully that will get you on their radar. 

Next ask them for a loan. Something small but noticeable. A grand. For a holiday / DIY / car / whatever. Just make sure you get one. Then pay it back on time and without missing a payment. Or straight away as soon as you can. You'll pay a bit extra on the interest but you'll have a credit history that you can build on. At this stage that's more important. Get one from your bank and not bleeding Wonga or some other shit company. 

Next, get one of those starter credit cards. Set your limit to 250Â£ a month or less. Max it out over the month. Pay it back in full. Max it out. Pay it back. *Don't* be a chump and miss a payment. Repeat for six to nine months. You'll start building up your credit history. If you think you won't be able to, use your credit card card for everything. Coffee, transport, food, gum, entertainment, drinks. Just make sure you don't go crazy. Read the terms and conditions. Make damn sure you don't miss a payment or you'll get raped with interest charges. But if you pay it off in flight each month you should be fine. People get into trouble when they miss payments. i.e. They spend what they can't afford to pay back. Don't make that mistake. 


When you are eligible, upgrade your limit. 500Â£ this time do the same for six to nine months. If you're earning what you say you are earning this shouldn't be difficult to pay off. In full. Never miss a payment. Get one that you can manage online. Check every day. Make sure you're not missing payments. Set up quick payments on your main bank account so that you can pay off the credit card quickly without entering all the details. Don't miss a fucking payment. Remember it takes up to three days for them to get your payment. Don't miss a payment! 

After doing this for two years go back to your bank. You'll of had two years of solid credit building history. Hopefully you've not missed a payment and your credit score is looking good. Your bank will literally not stop offering you credit every time you walk in. Close down your starter credit card. Get a proper credit card with a limit of a grand. Maybe from your bank. Maybe another bank. Rinse and repeat. 

The key is to have some sort of a history. Hopefully good. You seem like you can hold a job and pay bills. Problem is no one else knows. So you gots'ta show them by playing their game. Oh that's another tip. Put bills in your name. Not mobile phone bills. That shit don't count. I'm talking electric, gas, water, telephone. If you live with your parents ask them to transfer some bills to your name. 

As you've probably found out. If the credit agencies don't know you exist they aren't going to lend you money.

What I was getting at was that there was a conscious decision after partition to reject Irish culture, either by adopting the idea of being solely British or attempting to create the 'Ulster Protestant nation' as a sub-nation of the British (rather than Irish) nation.

I've worked in a number of fields where I get out of my depth frequently. I'll give you a run down of the subjects I covered in history if you wish. I'll give you a bibliography of all the books I've read as well.... if you wish 

I just find it funny that men from Ulster... on an anniversary of the Battle of the Boyne, during the most destructive and violent of battles shouted ""No surrender"" at people we refer to as ""Jerry"", and did really fucking well. So well they had to fall back because no one could keep up, nine of them getting VCs, men of various ideologies fighting for a collective reason, dying in droves but showing everyone up. Their cohorts and their enemies. 

The 36th were a force to be reckoned with and their own commanders thought they were shit. That worked in their favour historically if you ask me. 

I just think you're picking holes and getting offended where really zero offense is meant.

And as someone from east Belfast, we say ""kid"" but its pronounced like ""Ku"" from ""Ku Klux Klan"", but with about half the emphasis, and ""Id"" is like ""Yid"". So it's Ku(quick)-Yid. Its usually a term of endearment. I'm not so sure in this instance since you're taking things kinda thick, kuyid.

Carvajal is unrealistic, name another really good RB and but him in the side.

Wouldn't have Can at RB because although he is going to be a world class player, I think he is more suited as a holding midfield player, that way he can make those thriving runs forward.

The comment about Sterling was a little sarcastic (about not being good enough for a prem side), but in my opinion the, the other things I said are true. He is only good to have in the team when a break is on.

Inigo Martinez is probably just false hope that we get a properly good, outstanding young CB at Liverpool. I have no problem with Sakho being in the side at all.

No Lucas because I think Can will end up being better than him in the CDM role. His passing, and his small period as a CB shows this.

At the end of the day, Sterling is going to be much more expensive, probably demand higher wages, if not now than in a year or two, clearly has massive ego and attitude problems - he only went to Liverpool because they offered him the most cash, he is the definition of a mercenary and he gets into trouble off the pitch as well. Not holistic. Oh and there's all the Rodwell/Sinclair ""Man city ruining youth"" baggage that comes with him if we have the audacity to not play him every game. 

De Bruyne is quieter, more professional, he's more polished, still is loads of potential to get better, he's not motivated mostly by money, I'd much much rather have him.

null,false,ScheduledRelapse,null,null,null,"The United States has a much more accommodating political structure that allows the states to operate autonomously on many matters. Allowing the states to create very different environments that reflect the values and culture of those states. 

The UK until very recently had one central government located in England that made all the decisions for the entire country. Very recent Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales have got very very limited devolution of powers but nothing similar to the level of autonomy that States enjoy. This has not allowed the other countries to modify their countries to reflect their different cultural values the way American states have been able to. 


Secondly the United States is primarily a collection of Equal States joined together. For people in the smaller nations the UK often has felt more like the English ruling over everyone else rather than a collection of equal states. 

The other big difference is the population size issue. England is much much larger the other 3 countries in population. Meaning that even if a satisfactory amount of powers are eventually given to the 3 smaller countries (a situation that is still very uncertain) all federal law will continue to effectively be whatever the English want with no-ones else votes really mattering. With the 50 states being split fairly evenly between blue and red on a federal level there is some balance allowing everyone to feel heard sometimes. 

The people of Texas are able to have enough federal influence and enough autonomy that they don't feel continually stifled by the fact they remain part of the United States. Thus their grievance has settled down over time and the population has accepted their position. The Scottish don't have the influence or autonomy to feel that way.

1. Chain - every few days. You want to be able to feel the chain is 'wet' every time you touch it. Check the tension and make sure there's enough play but not too much - it needs to move maybe 1"" up and down. 

2. Tyres - every day. Give them a kick or feel them with your finger and check pressures whenever you can. The bike will feel wrong if you don't and it's dangerous. Keep an eye on their wear - if the rear wears in the middle or the front on the shoulders too much it needs replacing. 

3. Oil - every two weeks. Replace every 4-5K miles or 6 months whichever comes sooner. Oil changes are super easy to do and take basically five minutes. 

4. Brakes/brake pads - every two weeks. Make sure there's meat on the friction material and check the condition of the disks - a step between the friction zone and the outer rim means they're worn. 

5. Forks/suspension components - every month but make sure the forks aren't leaking. 

Those are the very basics, there's other more complicated stuff in the engine but you don't want to deal with that until you've got the basics down. 

As I've mentioned countless times on this subreddit, the best place to go for newbies to motorbike maintenance is Youtube. [Delboy's Garage](https://www.youtube.com/user/Moonfleet41) is the best place for this. Del and Pen are fantastic at making things easy to understand and really walk you through the basics. Just search for Delboys garage along with the thing you're struggling with (e.g. brakepad change) and a video will come up. First time I did a coolant flush was using one of his videos and it all went really well. 

Buy yourself a professional set of tools from Halfords as they're terrific value and have everything you need. Go get a Haynes as they're fantastic. Also get a paddock stand and front stand as it makes maintenance a breeze.

Chelsea not valuing him only means that they are willing to sell him and would accept a lower price than if he was number one. 

How other clubs value him is the determining factor in his sale price. 

Example, David Luiz was not favoured by Mourinho. PSG valued him highly enough to pay 50M for him. 

Another example, Juan Mata. He couldn't make the starting team but United bought him for 37M. 

This imbalance between how much the club values the player and how much other clubs value the player is critical to the transfer market. 

Will Cech sell for a record amount? No idea but, either way, it will have nothing to do with him being second choice. 

This summer is the summer of goalkeepers. It's not often that two top 5 keepers move clubs. Suddenly United have a hole and Madrid have 2 top keepers. If United or PSG buy Lloris then Spurs have a hole. If Arsenal and United are fighting for a player then anythings possible, assuming Chelsea would sell Cech to either one of them.

Similarly, Davies gets full credit for the genius that was ""The Family of Blood"" and ""Silence in the Library"", but he also takes the blame for turning the Doctor into Dobby trapped in a birdcage and for never knowing what the hell to do with Martha as a companion. 

The point being is that there is a clear arc for both as showrunners. Over time telling a cracking story gave way to serving emotional comfort food for the viewers. They stopped even trying to be logical or keep continuity. Watching ""The Day of the Doctor"" was infuriating because it had the passion that was missing from the rest of series 7. I felt cheated out of a great send off series for Matt Smith. All of series 7 could have had that level of excitement if Moffat hadn't been bored or burnt out.

You mention Operation Fresco and state you were part of it, saying that you were on 19k covering for the ""ungrateful tossers"" that we are. You also seem to imply that 'we' (although I was in my teens at the time) were on 30k, while you were doing it. The wage for a firefighter in 2002 was [Â£18,843 after completing 2 years probationary period.] (http://www.theguardian.com/money/2002/jan/27/wageslaves.careers)

The current wage of a *full time* firefighter [Â£28,766 after passing the 2 year probationary period] (https://www.google.co.uk/#q=firefighter+salary+uk) (which again, is less than the Â£30k+ you quote). The current dispute is about retirement age and pensions. The retirement age has been increased from 55 to 60 (as it was in the RAF to much annoyance) and increasing pension contributions and was nothing about salary.

As for the second jobs accusation, many firefighters in the UK (I think 25%) are part time, earning around Â£10k per year, and in many cases less! (Retained firefighters are on a paid per call basis, with an annual retaining fee of around Â£2,000: no calls = less money). Do you propose that they live on that amount alone? Cross their fingers that a house burns down this month so the kids can have some food? As for full timers; If a full time firefighter wants to work a 42/48 hour working week, and then work some more, who are you to say they can't do that on their days off? Are other people also told they can't work on their days off too?

De Bruyne does seem like a nice kid though.

These two statements contradict eachother. Are you saying that Chelsea would accept a lower price because he is second choice? Because that means him being second choice has been a factor in setting his price.

When a club no longer has a need for a player, then that players value to the owning club decreases. This means that they will not demand as much for that player as they would if they needed him.

I.e. if the top end houses go up, the rest goes up too. I think this is because houses, perhaps more than many other markets, are based on perception. If people perceive an area to be a good one, they are instantly willing to pay more. I expect there are psychological factors at play here surrounding feelings of security, etc. 

The super rich moving in creates this feeling that the area must be on the ""up"", and that commands a premium. This spreads to the immediate geographical vicinity (being *near* Kensington is as good as being *in* it, right?), so it's a ripple effect. 

It's also likely the case that once the mega-wealthy move in and start splashing about capital, this attracts business, which needs people to work there, who need places to live, increasing demand. 

You're also ignoring the fact that a lot of the time the rich don't just buy a flat in Kensington and leave it at that. A lot of the problem is the rich buying up huge swathes of property and letting it out, or even simply leaving it vacant to sell later at a higher price.

In other words, unless houses are built to keep up with demand, I think the super-rich might just make us poorer, simply by moving in next door (unless one happens to own their home, then you become considerably wealthier). 

Of course the real problem of the super rich is the buggers are getting richer while everyone else gets poorer due to the shitty economy.

&gt;The right to hold elections by secret ballot is included in numerous treaties and international agreements that obligate their signatory states:

&gt; * Article 23 of the American Convention on Human Rights (the Pact of San Jose, Costa Rica) grants to every citizen of member states of the Organization of American States the right and opportunity ""to vote and to be elected in genuine periodic elections, which shall be by universal and equal suffrange and by secret ballot that guarantees the free expression of the will of the voters"".[19]

&gt; * Paragraph 7.4 of the Document of the Copenhagen Meeting of the Conference on the Human Dimension of the CSCE, obligates the member states of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to ""ensure that votes are cast by secret ballot or by equivalent free voting procedure, and that they are counted and reported honestly with the official results made public.""[20]

&gt; * Article 5 of the Convention on the Standards of Democratic Elections, Electoral Rights and Freedoms in the Member States of the Commonwealth of Independent States obligates electoral bodies not to perform ""any action violating the principle of voter's secret will expression.""[21]

But sure lets throw that away, because there **may** be voter fraud, only wait, the exact thing you claim you are trying to prevent (Heads of houses forcing everybody in a house to vote a certain way), is still possible, it's just not defined as fraud.

&gt;""Waaaah waaaah....

Can you even read? I've given plenty of reasons people can't turn up:

* Work trips

* International holidays (thanks to the fixed parliament act, this is less likely, but there are still ways an election can be called and you have a holiday booked)

* Shift patterns making it a major inconvenience (big whoop, it's not impossible but why even allow proxy votes? Surely people should be expected to fly back from holidays &amp; work trips in order to vote)

Oh and the current voting method is not 'Centuries old', secret ballots, where only introduced in 1872 (and postal voting was allowed for civilians since 1948), postal voting has slowly been phased in not as some stupid idea as you seem to think, but out of necessity, initially WWI &amp; WWII, then the fact that many professions travelled in the later part of the 20th century and the fact that almost all do in the 21st.

Proxy voting doesn't cut it as an alternative because plenty of people move away from their home and don't put down roots where they live and it is easier to tamper with the result through intimidation and lying.",null,0,null,1431990254,null,0,false,0,crdgkzq,null,t3_36cu3i,null,t1_crdgkzq,null,t1_crdf56l,null,null,null,1433138319,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

I understand the history there; England being the most powerful country in the UK and the main driving force behind the Empire just isn't going to have its identity as rooted in being the underdog.

He did exactly the same thing when the pressure was on and he gave James Pearce an exclusive throwing the transfer committee under the bus.

null,false,tomtomtomo,null,null,null,"&gt;These two statements contradict each other. Are you saying that Chelsea would accept a lower price because he is second choice? Because that means him being second choice has been a factor in setting his price.

They don't contradict at all. Being second choice means that Chelsea would likely accept a lower price than if he was first choice. That's just the starting minimum price. The final price is not going to be the minimum that Chelsea would sell him for so long as there is demand for him. Assuming there is demand, which I think is safe to assume with Cech, then it's the demand from other clubs that determine the final price. 

&gt;When a club no longer has a need for a player, then that players value to the owning club decreases. This means that they will not demand as much for that player as they would if they needed him.

Yes, that's what I said. Chelsea would likely accept a lower price but that isn't necessarily the final price. 

&gt;Congratulations of cherry picking two examples out of the hundreds of thousands which don't agree with your statement.

There is a difference between a run of the mill player that we've never heard of and a top 5 keeper. Run of the mills players suffer from too much supply therefore their price is much closer to the minimum set by the club. The examples I chose were of world class players who were undervalued at Chelsea. That's not cherry picked so much as exactly representative of the Cech situation. 

&gt;Let me ask you this, if you were selling a new Porsche, and you really needed to keep the last one because you were going to do an exhibit with it, would you sell it to me for $500 because that's what I value it at, or would you take into consideration the fact that you value it highly also?

In your example the seller puts a higher value on the item than the buyer. That's the opposite of the Cech situation. 

You have a slightly old but still top class Porsche and you just bought a newer model. You aren't going to drive the old one anymore as you like your new one better. You figure that if someone gives you 10k for the old one then you'll sell it. 2 Porsche collectors show up at the auction and both want to buy it as it would complete their collections. What do you think happens to the price? Would it sell for 10k or would the price be driven up by having 2 people who highly value it compete against each other for it?

Everywhere is a bubble. Glasgow, Manchester, Liverpool are their own separate bubbles. So can people please stop trying to make it out that London and the South-East and the only bubbles.

People do like to present the South East+London as a separate bubble, that is devoid from the problems of the rest of the country. But in doing so, they stay ignorant of what London and the south east is.

If people actually spent some time in London, and saw not just the centre, but on the outskirts or inner-city, they will see that London is very very diverse. On the outskirts, where I live, you have countryside and a more love for agriculture, the environment and NIMBYism. However, when you go more inner-city, to places like Catford etc. You see another side of London which you wouldn't really know existed if you didn't live in London

The South-East is also a completely separate bubble to London. A lot of fishing towns are a shadow of their former self, a lot of the Land is greenbelt which they like to protect.

The capital of the UK is London, ergo, the National parliament should stay near the capital. Moving it more North, means that to us, it would mean nothing as we are too far away to care. Moving it will do nothing, but drop the problem onto other people.

This isn't directed at you, but at the notion of ""well you are from London, you don't know what it is like to live in X"". Which coming from London and living in the South East, really annoys me.

With this situation 50mil fee is nowhere near realistic, and even if he was happy at his club with 3-4 year contract, he is not a 50 mil worth player.

KDB for 30-35 is a steal for me, he could turn out to be a world class player. If not, he will still hold his value pretty well. So KDB for me if we make a direct comparison.

I could understand someone arguing the bad outweighs the good with Rodgers, that maybe there are more doubts than positives, but to argue that Rodgers has pretty much done nothing in his time here and that he's contributed nothing positive is about as retarded as it comes. Congratulations on setting a new bar of idiocy.

How about backing him up because of the immeasurable improvement that a series of players have had under him; Coutinho, Henderson, Sterling, Sturridge, Gerrard last year. The fact we played some of the best attacking football in our recent history under him (why the fuck weren't we brilliant all the time under Kenny considering he too had Suarez?), including a string of great performances at the back end of the 2012/2013 season where we were without Suarez. How about our fantastic run of form last year coming not solely on the back of Suarez's form (which actually dipped somewhat after January) but his movement of Gerrard into a central holding position that allowed us to play a quicker more direct style that brought the best out of our attacking two, and allowed us to totally overpower Arsenal etc. There are plenty of reasons not to totally lose faith in a manager because of one bad season. That's what so many of our fanbase did with Rafa when he finished 7th and now we're all fucking pining over him like all that shit never happened and we always loved him unconditionally.

Or I can't deny that, but we do have serious problems, which do kind of get swept under the rug in the North/South divide. Both sides present London as a great place, for different reason. When reality is completely different. This is a view I hope we both can agree on.

&gt; Germany manages.

Germany has a different model and a different history in terms of issues like this. It's regional powers are quite strong, due to their history of being a separate conglomerate of provinces.

&gt; With 15 million people, by far the largest city and with London is not going to be ignored. Plus, personally I would hope moving the Parliament would be part of a larger project of decentralization. Give the London assembly more serious powers.

Well coming back to an earlier point, a lot of issues in London are being ignored, I.e. pollution levels, housing shortages etc. And would still be ignored because everyone needs to show London in a money making light, or the whole narrative comes crumbling down. 

I would instead give it to a mayor, not an assembly, as the assembly would not be to interested in my own constituency because it is more Kent then London, as well as heavily Conservative. So we would run completely opposite to what the rest of London would want (Sounds kind of similar to what Scotland feels at the moment).

My own personal opinion is to keep Parliament of the UK in the capital of the UK. But devolve a lot, therefore issues that affect certain areas can be dealt with more effectively. 

But whatever happens, we need to educate the public on how politics in the UK is actually done. Since there is quite a bit of confusion going round I feel.

He can't finish or cross. he has fantastic athletic ability but slightly average PL technical ability. the combination of the two makes him a top 6 type player. A Liverpool type player. 

You can develop better vision, awareness, positioning and overall smartness with experience. but experience doesnt really improve technical ability. What we see with Raheem now is pretty much what we will see his entire career in terms of technical ability. (Just look at how players like Maradona can still do amazing shit with the ball to prove how 'natural' technique is)

He will never become a great player with the ball at his feet.

he might end up with such great vision that he simply needs to tap the ball in (CRonaldo style) but its unlikely.

Whether we were or weren't is another matter of debate. Still, my response is that this has more or less turned in to a shit show for the squad, Sterling, and Rogers. Assuming everything the reports have been saying is true and Sterling does indeed want out, what then? I agree that Sterling is spectacular and very young. Should then, the club bend to his will, do everything in their power to keep him there and give him more money along with promises of better results in the future? I think Liverpool FC have had high expectations every season for the last few decades (since our last League win). The plan every season is silverware and top 4 finish if not winning the league title. How do we prove to him that we want him but more importantly - that he should stay? I am not an executive so I honestly could not even begin to tell you how that is accomplished, but I am starting to feel like he has tilted the situation too far in to the direction where he will not be a Liverpool player in the near future. But I am also reminded of how Gerrard at one point or another also made a request to be traded, feeling frustrated with the club (I am not putting them in the same class - just making an argument). Does a marquee signing prove to him that we want everything as bad as he wants it? I don't think either of this makes him a bad person or a good person. Speaking as a fan of the team, one can't help but feel betrayed/hurt since we care about our players day in and day out, win or lose. I get that. I get that may be he doesn't feel like he owes Liverpool (the club or its fans) anything. He may be right. They can't all be Gerrard. But I also wouldn't want his decision being made based on how many zero's are on his wages. I want him to want to play for us and for the shirt. If his doubts about being here are greater than his dedication for the club and its fans then it might be best for him to find success somewhere else, and he has the talent to do so. I'll leave it at this - so far this season I am glad I didn't buy his jersey. I'll do my best to judge him by his performance on the pitch and his character out of it.

You, on your own, can't terminate the contract during a fixed term for lack of lighting etc. Firstly, the tenancy is under all of your names, so it would end the tenancy for the whole property. Secondly, that is something for the court to decide, whether the breaches mean the contract can be terminated.

Your best bet would be to find a replacement if you decide you want to leave.

[August 2014](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/liverpool-boss-brendan-rodgers-hesitant-over-raheem-sterling-contract-1461482): 

&gt; Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has hinted the club could resist handing Raheem Sterling a bumper new contract worth a reported Â£5.2m-a-year.

&gt; ""Raheem is a kid who has propelled himself on to another level. He got rewarded for that and that will always be the case here but we have to be careful because, when you reward young players too quickly, that will be their downfall.

&gt; âWhen you reward young players too quickly â Raheemâs still only 19 â you give them too much too early and that will be their downfall.

Thanks, dad!

[August 2014](http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/liverpool-starlet-raheem-sterling-told-4063058): 

&gt; Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers has told Raheem Sterling that he will have to wait for the new contract that will give him parity with Anfieldâs top earners.

[September 2014](http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/24/football-transfer-rumours):

&gt; Sterling is somewhat miffed at remaining one of the lowest-paid senior players at Anfield

&gt; Brendan Rodgers warns Raheem Sterlingâs agent over new Liverpool deal

&gt; Brendan Rodgers has warned Raheem Sterlingâs advisers that Liverpool will not be held to ransom over a new contract and fears an excessive salary could jeopardise the playerâs future.

&gt; offer of Â£70,000 a week was more than double the 20-year-old forward's current salary

[Feb 2015](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31317209):

&gt; ""an incredible deal for a young player""

&gt; 'Maybe I have too much faith in young players' (referencing Sterling not signing - playing the hard-to-get ex-girlfriend argument)

&gt; Rogers described ""incredible"" offer to Sterling

&gt; Rogers ""relaxed"" about new Sterling contract

[April 2015](http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/32149613): 

Liverpool leak to the BBC that Sterling turned down Â£100k a week (not true - they didn't offer anything at the beginning of the season, then offered to double his wages - which they described as ""incredible"" and ""too much, too early"")

&gt; In the interview with the BBC, Sterling also said he would have accepted less than Â£100,000 a week had he been offered a new deal this time last year, when the Reds were chasing the Premier League title.

&gt; ""If, at that point in time, I was offered a contract, I most definitely would have signed straight away, probably for far less money than being said now,"" he said

Rogers never passed down an opportunity to talk about the Sterling deal and create an expectation that the deal was imminent and that it was waiting on Sterling to just accept Rodgers' advice and take less money. Funny how the deal from 12 months ago that Sterling wanted (when the deal *should* have been signed) is now portrayed as Liverpool's Â£100k first offer that Sterling turned down.

The lowest of the low was the club leaking to the BBC that Sterling turned down Â£100k and turning the fans against him (fuck, i'd stop playing at that point and phone in the rest of my appearances as well).

Complete and total clusterfuck - a lesson in how not to handle young talent. It is an embarrassment that Sterling has played out this season on only Â£30k a week while we signed absolute muppets on Â£70-80k a week. As a sign of goodwill they should have doubled Sterlings wages at the end of last season and kept the same contract term, as they did with Suarez - none of this bullshit David Brent lecturing from Rogers to the media about how Sterling is too young to earn six-figures.

Sterling will leave and we deserve it, nobody will be fired over this and Liverpool will be mediocre again next season if they keep these clowns running the club.

and Chelsea won't tell them. This isn't a shop, it's an auction. 

&gt;Other clubs aren't stupid like you think they are. They know that Cech isn't first choice. They know that Chelsea will be willing to let him go for less because of this.

Yes, I've talked that. It means their minimum price is lower than it would be if he was first choice. 

&gt;Did you really think that it was just me and you who have worked this out?

I don't think you've worked out anything. The fact that you didn't understand my Porsche example highlights that you don't seem to understand the situation and auctions. 

How do you think auctions work? 1 person sets a hidden minimum and then multiple people bid on the item. The bidders don't just ask the person what the minimum is and pay that. They compete with each other to see who values the item the most and that defines the final price, so long as it is above the minimum. 

In this case, Cech has proven PL and CL champions experience, still has a number of years left and the supply of top 5 GK for sale is very very low. Yes the fact that Chelsea don't value him means the price will be lower than it would if they highly valued him but demand by buyers will drive his price. 

Anyway, have a good day.

null,false,Muzer0,eng-hampshire,Hampshire,null,"Basically, there are a whole load of possible reasons depending on where you're talking about. Do you have a particular location in mind or are you asking just generally?

On a four-track railway where neither train is ""turning off"" onto a branch, this could be because the faster train needs to stop at a station that doesn't have platforms on the fast lines (or if it remained on the fast lines to stop at this station, it would in turn hold up the train behind it). But say it's only stopping at one station, but your train is stopping at five, you'll want to send the faster train ahead even if it's slightly late to avoid it losing any more time. So your train will stop to let it pass and cross in front of your train.

Alternatively, depending on the exact track/junction layout, it may be a four-track railway that turns into two two-track railways, or a two-track branch coming off a four-track railway on a flat junction, and the train is on the ""wrong"" side and needs to cross across your train's path (or vice versa, your train is turning off and needs to cross the path of the fast train). But the fast train might be timetabled to proceed across the junction first, in which case your train will have to wait, assuming everything's running reasonably to time. Sometimes it's just the way the timetable falls that one train will be booked to wait a few minutes at the junction while another train crosses its path.

Or it could just be a short passing loop, as others have said, but to be honest I couldn't name too many of these. It seems to be a relatively rare thing to have a passenger train passing another passenger train on a short loop in this country. I find usually if this is happening, it will happen in the context of a station, where you can just have a prolonged stop at the station and nobody will really be any the wiser. An example near me is Eastleigh, where the stopping services to London Waterloo stop for a while (~10 minutes if I recall) to allow the fast services to pass on the through lines. In the opposite direction, I believe this happens at Southampton Central instead. But maybe I'm biased from the sort of trains I've been on, maybe there are more passenger trains that pass other passenger trains on short passing loops than I can think of right now.",null,0,null,1431998896,null,0,1431999140,0,crdld6f,null,t3_36diah,null,t1_crdld6f,null,t3_36diah,null,null,null,1433140644,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Your post is 19 days old, if you're still in this situation I can perchance get some more advice for you over the next couple days.

It's interesting that a couple of people have commented along the lines of 'they can't just stop your money', I can tell you from working in welfare advice/advocacy that they can, they do and they will. We regularly see benefits cut ('sanctioned') entirely for 4, or 12, or occasionally more weeks, literally for the crime of missing a single appointment, or leaving a blank day in your jobsearch diary.
This is not rare or even that unusual, at one point in 2014 one in five claimants had received a sanction.

Check out our cleanser mega review linked to in the sidebar. Cleansing is better at night, to remove sunscreen (recommended spring to autumn), make up and the general dirt of the day. Exfoliating is fine - again we have a mega review - but scrubbing is not great, that can increase irritation and dehydration depending on the product and its ingredients.

People seem to be saying it was the right thing to do or at least that's all I can take from the comments.  I just can't understand nor agree with that and it has nothing to do with my broader feelings on the manager and I'd say exactly the same regardless of who it was.  

I would also contend further that this statement put Raheem under a lot of pressure that was entirely unnecessary and I do believe it was what eventually led to the very stupid unauthorized interview.

All of that said, I agree Raheem has messed this up massively and handled it even worse.  I agree his agent seems to be a complete idiot.  I agree he needs to play week in and week out and that if he were smart he would absolutely be better off staying at Liverpool.

I'd disagree with this. Lambert's transfer policy at Villa can be best summed up as ""scatter gun"". He bought so many that it was bound to happen that one or two would be decent.

As for his legacy, he had a lot of stock with the Villa fans for taking a very tough job. He just didn't have the drive and personality to arrest Villa's slump, and his go-to was to have 11 men defending on the edge of the box, waiting, praying for a quick transition and a chance of a counter.

Some might be on the current state of the SDLP, or statements from smaller parties like the Greens or NI Cons that deserve a little air time.

Some might be on general causes such as gay marriage,abortion law reform, the need for a Stormont Opposition, improved public services, or reviving the economy.

And yes, some might be critical of Sinn Fein's blood-and-soil ethno-nationalist agenda, worship of political violence, and their general amnesia/wilful ignorance of the horrors their leading figures delivered upon the society they claim to represent. Some might also be in relation to the Orwellian doublespeak involved in words they use such as ""equality"" and ""peace process"".

I do find it notable though that whenever an opinion piece critical of Sinn Fein is posted an enormous pantomime is made of it by their supporters.

It does tend to suggest the supporters of one party on this subreddit are more hyper-sensitive to criticism than others (and frequently suggest such criticism is automatically invalidated by its source, something I don't recall supporters of other parties doing).

There are a few things you can do on results day, however (assuming you're doing A Levels now and will get your results on 13th August). At 7am, Track will probably have updated letting you know if you've got in or not, that'll give you an indication of your grades. At the earliest possible opportunity, go to your school/college and collect your grades, this will give you bargaining power later on.

If you're sure you want to go to Nottingham/ Surrey, you must apply to them through either clearing or adjustment. Do not drop out of Manchester before confirming a place elsewhere, you don't need to! These are pretty much the same thing, but adjustment is for when you've done better than expected, and clearing is for when you've done worse than expected. The difference here though is that like me last year, you simply want to go to a different uni from your firm. Many unis will have clearing pages, this is [Surrey's](http://www.surrey.ac.uk/clearing) (still showing last year's entry) and Nottingham's seems to be [here](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/ugapplicants/i-am-preparing-for-results-day/clearing-and-late-applications.aspx). Other places to look include the Telegraph, and many apps and websites have listings of clearing places. If Nottingham or Surrey have places in clearing for your course, ring them up. Be prepared here, you'll probably only get through to a student who'll ask your grades, but you may get an informal phone interview so it's good to know the best bits from your personal statement to give a convincing interview. They'll ask if you want to go through clearing or adjustment, tbh it doesn't really matter. If/ when you get a formal written offer (that's an email) then you can safely drop out of Manchester knowing you're still going to uni. Remember to have your UCAS number at the ready and all of your details. You want to get on the phone early, but don't do it in a stressful place like your school, at least go back to the car/ go home before ringing up. I went all the way back home (an hour drive) before ringing up and I got in fine.

I've heard legally savvy people make the claim that IP addresses are personal data - and they may well be right, actually.

The DPA doesn't care what you do with personal data: if you have it (published or not), you are bound by it.

In short: you are certainly handling personal data.  You should register.  The burdons aren't particularly onerous; you need to do reasonable things to make sure the data you hold is accurate, necessary, &amp; your users know what you're using the data for.  You also need to hand over to the user the data you hold about them if they ask (and pay the approprate fee).  None of these things are hard; you're probably doing it all already.



[1] https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/1591/personal_information_online_cop.pdf describes email addresses as ""obvious identifiers"".  The ICO is the governement body who has responsibility for enforcing the DPA, so while its opinion isn't definitive, it's certainly worth paying attention to.

People being on Sterling's case has everything to do with an agent trying to stick it to his old agency.

His performances have dipped and it really isn't helping the club in any way. Directing your ire at the manager in this case is extremely misguided.

The spike thing was a small jest (and I never said spinning) and if you read the full post again you can see the lady and I had some sensible ideas for improvements. I still advocate eye level indicators for all vehicles and I want them on the side of trucks at regular intervals.  
The cycle lane question was genuine it grew from an exchange with a rider on a different thread who said cycle lanes were shit (his words). My experience of cycle lanes is from Peterborough and Slough and although they are different types they are both preferable to road use. I drive on the A10 from the M25 to the North circ at least 3 times a week and I have always wondered why some riders use the road along with the traffic and some use the parallel cycle path. In that scenario I would have used the path as its safer and I know what disruption a 20mph bike causes on a 40mph road, from the answers on this and the other post I see how the condition of the path and the presence of pedestrians (and dogs) is considered a greater danger than the traffic.

null,false,thegoldenmandenis,null,null,null,"You keep saying there is a trade off between safety and a fast, efficient route. The fact is that there doesn't have to be this trade off, the only reason it exists at all is because cyclists are treated as second class road users who should be expected to sacrifice their own convenience in exchange for increased convenience for motorists, and a tiny bit of extra safety. But in fact whether you ever do gain any extra safety from the terrible bicycle infrastructure in this country is doubtful, and it often seems more dangerous. 

When I'm cycling to work it's because I want to get there quickly and efficiently, and if there is a bike path that will slow me down, there's no way I'm going to take that. If the bike path will help me I'm happy to take it, which is why I do use the bike path across Clapham Common for example - it's direct, good quality and not too difficult to get on and off it - but not the bike bath along the side of Queenstown Road on the approach to Chelsea Bridge - it's hard to enter and exit and the surface is uneven and strewn with debris.

I think you have to understand that if lots of cyclists are refusing to use cycle paths, it's not because we're difficult cunts, it's because the cycle path is inadequate. I would love there to be plenty of good quality, usable cycling infrastructure and if there were, I would use it. But it needs to prioritise the safety and convenience of the cyclist, not just the convenience of the motorist which is what almost all infrastructure up until now has done. And when new infrastructure that doesn't prioritise the motorist is built, you can see how up in arms people get about it in some quarters, with the LTDA planning a now abandoned legal challenge against the recently approved cycle superhighways in London. That's the kind of facility I can imagine I would use (if I were going in that direction - I wouldn't go out of my way to get to it though), but until we have a high quality network of reliable bike paths that cyclists feel they can trust, of the sort found in the Netherlands, you can't expect cyclists to trust infrastructure designers who clearly haven't got a clue.",null,0,null,1432021174,null,0,1432021492,0,crdumv9,null,t3_36b46t,null,t1_crdumv9,null,t1_crd9dad,null,null,null,1433145081,null,1,false,londoncycling,t5_2wcdj,1,null

In my experience, gentle handling, chemical exfoliation and avoiding triggers are crucial for maintenance. SD can't go away, but it can be managed. SD is the biggest YMMV in reference to triggers.

SD is a form of inflammation triggered by excess proliferation of the yeast Malassezia furfur that feeds on over-production of sebum (of oleic acid and cholesterol in it), thus often happens to people with combo-oily to very oily skin. Before realizing it was SD and knowing how to manage it, my face is a flaky, itchy nightmare, especially in the winter and when I'm under a lot of stress, regardless of how much moisturizer I piled on my face, since I thought it was just overly dry skin.

However, it's best to heed Firefox's advice to be gentle on your skin.

The problem in England is not so much the lack of representation for local communities, but rather the extraordinary London-centric view applied by the government. The aim of a federal England would seem to be to take power *away* from London, but without many natural communities to put it in. Manpool? *Really?* What about Birmentry? Southetermouth? Lincwich? With the arguable exception of Yorkshire, which seems to have retained a modicum of cultural identity, the rest of the country is Notlondon, with relatively homogeneous values - and where there are differences in values it is more along rural/urban lines. 

Is there really such a significant difference between the characters of Newcastle, Manchester, and Birmingham that they would all genuinely choose to have different approaches to, say, education policy, for reasons of cultural identity or economic priorities rather than because of what the particular people elected to the council that year happened to think at the time?

Scotland and Wales, certainly, have sufficiently distinct cultural values that with devolved power they will genuinely govern themselves according to different priorities, and it is this that seems to be the driving force behind discussions of federalisation. But for England it seems to be a poor solution - yet without federalising England, a federal UK would have all the members complaining about the unfair representation of all the other members.

All seems crazy to me. The reason for a political party should be shared values and shared purpose. The thing that struck me about the campaign was the #edstone. Not that it was a gimmick per say but the things being enshrined in stone where not core values but policies that are all about fiddling at the edges. Left and right and centre don't really mean anything. I think what's more important is what is right and what is wrong. 

The are glaring problems with this country that where not addressed, there was no alternative offered. 

Admittedly is difficult when the media mindset is to wheel out ancient tropes - but to truly combat this we need to speak to ordinary people - this means engaging, and more effectively. There is no better way to do this then through Social Media.

As we have seen 5 times this year in London, mixing with traffic can have fatal consequences.  
A lot of you are claiming cyclists are treated as second class road users, I don't see it. All road users sacrifice their own convenience in exchange for the convenience of others, its called driving. Yes the road system is aimed at car drivers as there are more of them, a classic example is the stupid idea of putting car parking spaces in bus lanes which just negates the purpose of the bus lane.  
I wish I could have your attitude in my truck. If I want to go to a delivery point I want to get there quickly and efficiently (actually I don't as I get paid more for taking longer and I don't pay for my fuel but I am trying to make a point) but I cant use every route option. I am banned from many roads for no good reason.  
Example. I go to North Harrow from the M25 so the easiest route is A1 to Apex corner, right on the A41, left on the A410 through Stanmore and left on the A409. We used to follow this route until about 2001/2 when somebody decided we were not allowed through Stanmore unless we were making a delivery there and now I have to follow a 5 mile detour through smaller roads. It makes no sense.

&gt; On 10 May 1942, Bedfordshire and HMT St Loman were dispatched from Morehead City to search for a U-boat believed to be in the vicinity of Ocracoke Island. The ships were spotted by U-558, commanded by KapitÃ¤nleutnant GÃ¼nther Krech. Later in the evening Krech, believing his sub had been detected, fired on St Loman, which spotted the torpedoes and evaded them. The search continued throughout the night. At 5:40 am on 11 May 1942, U-558 fired a torpedo at Bedfordshire, missed, and fired a second, which scored a direct hit and sank her immediately. All 37 men aboard were killed. **A 38th crewman, a young stoker named Sam Nutt, had been detained at Morehead City by local police and narrowly missed boarding the ship for her last patrol.**

&gt; On 14 May, the bodies of two seamen were discovered by a Coast Guardsman on the shores of Ocracoke Island. Their British uniforms offered the first indication that Bedfordshire may have met her end, and the U-boat menace was presumed to be responsible. Her fate was confirmed the following year after U-558 was sunk, resulting in the capture of KapitÃ¤nleutnant Krech and his ship's diaries.",null,0,null,1432023270,null,0,1432027910,0,crdv4w7,null,t3_36dq4e,null,t1_crdv4w7,null,t3_36dq4e,null,null,null,1433145318,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

So I think if he wants out then we let him go, reinvest the money (hopefully a little more sensibly than previous seasons). Sure he is a big player to lose but with his recent form and the fact that there are players in the squad that could take over his place (Lallana, Coutinho, Ibe, Lazar + a new striker) we could get over it. 

That being said I don't know where he'll end up. Maybe City they need homegrown players and they have the money. Might help us land Milner too, which I am all for.

Moreno offers a lot going forward but nothing but despair defensively.

The issue is that if consumers see prices continuously falling, they may be more hesitant to buy something. Why would you buy X now if it is going to be half the price in a week?

Less people buying things means less shops and less shop workers, and less goods and less manufacturers, and less logistic workers etc. etc. 

At least, that is the idea. But it seems this deflation might not truly line up with past examples, as the price reduction seems to be limited to a few areas (foods, fuels etc.).

null,false,HistoryLessonforBitc,,Card-carrying Labour supporter,null,"I think they were trying to make some broader point about ""what would happen if all these insane tabloid immigration/EU/mindless nationalism policies suddenly became law?"" and Ukip was only the vehicle to that end. That said, I'd argue that even though they might not have been explicit commitments, some of the things would be a logical conclusion of positions Ukip had espoused, and things that would implictly have popular support and a mandate (e.g. A desire to ignore ""political correctness"" in government + a desire to strongly crack down on illegal immigration = well, why shouldn't UK Border Force just racially profile and target takeaways? And who cares about their rights or welfare?). 

And the thing is, UKIP at that point didn't have a manifesto, but they also didn't (and still don't, outside of Carswell's principled libertarianism which appears to be a minority view) have any kind of underpinning philosophy besides naked, vaguely right wing populism that broadly just followed the editorial line of the Sun; nor does it have any legislative or ideological achievements to its name. The programme therefore, based on the party's and Farage's public statements, had to assume that a Ukip government would be a hard right populist one. That's not unreasonable.

However, it was so poorly written and hamfistedly executed that it didn't really do much of anything, neither changing the minds of kippers or even really reinforcing the belief of those who don't like Ukip very well. There was a vague nod at exploring the consequences of what this tabloid mindset might lead to if it was used to form policy (e.g. The very prospect of Brexit causing enormous jitters in the business community which would then directly impact workers who trusted Ukip to protect their interests) but it was all glossed over and never really given room to grow, which is a pity since it would have actually been interesting in a Daily Mail Island kind of way. As it is it fell flat and ended with a ridiculous deus ex machina in which the central character was good at heart because she rejected Ukip, despite being an enthusiastic and vehement supporter of it to the point of becoming an MP, and we're expected to assume that she was just misguided about the nature of the party and a lot of its support base despite her being immersed in it for a number of years. That's bollocks and completely unbelievable. You didn't think that a populist government playing to the gallery wouldn't give a toss about the rights of criminals and illegal immigrants? Then you're a moron.

The unique opportunity now is that such a large proportion have voted for smaller parties that have been disadvantaged, or parties who, and all respect to the SNP for this given how many MPs they'd potentially lose under a proportional system (though they presumably see benefits in breaking the grip on power that the large parties have, so let's not assume they're being entirely selfless), are illustrating the problem by being substantially over-represented. 

As it stands, the idea that most MPs represents ""the interests of the constituency"" is ludicrous on the face of it anyway, as a huge proportion of constituencies are deeply polarised along smaller community boundaries. E.g. my constituency are realistically split in 5+ separate communities with little in common. 

Some are poor areas that vote overwhelmingly Labour, some are distinctly upper class areas that votes overwhelmingly Tory. These communities don't generally mix. I'm confident you can find lots of people in one or the other of these communities that have never set foot in several of the others. We're talking council estates vs. million pound plus villas surrounding private sports clubs and golf clubs here. Overall the Tory candidate this time won with 165 votes and didn't manage to get anywhere near an overall majority for the area. Whichever of Labour or the Tories wins our seat, multiple local communities go unrepresented by candidates that don't give a shit about them because they know the only ones voting for them in those areas are die-hard supporters anyway and it's not cost effective vs. focusing on the few mixed communities where they can shift the vote.

FPTP to me is based on a lie of local representation that is used to attempt to justify a fundamental injustice by withholding representation from the minority. It's a classical example of a majority abusing its power.

It's essentially a caste system brought with them from Pakistan, specifically [Kashmir](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azad_Kashmir) which is where a lot of British Pakistanis originate from. Each person belongs to a clan which they are born into like the rest of their family. Each clan has an ancestor that all members share, and the clan has a head. The term Biraderi is used to refer to them which means Brotherhood. These clans then engage in the usual politics that groups of humans do, such as forging masses of postal votes.

&gt;In general, alcohol is removed from the blood at the rate of about one unit an hour. But this varies from person to person. It can depend on your size and gender, as men tend to process alcohol quicker than women; how much food youâve eaten; the state of your liver, and your metabolism (how quickly or slowly your body turns food into energy).  

&gt;âImagine youâre drinking until three or four in the morning and you wake up at 8 am,â says Dr Wallace. âIf youâve had six or seven units, you could still have several units of alcohol in your body when you start your day. This is because your body can only process around one unit an hour. With several units of alcohol still in your body you would still be over the drink drive limit.â

We concluded that Aldi have amazing marketing to make people think they are cheaper and better. It must be amazing because you've got to be really convinced to cope with:

- The narrow aisles
- The small checkouts
- The lack of support for credit cards (or maybe they took them but charged a fee, I forget now)

**Where did you purchase:** Denmark (CP)

**About you:** Combo-oily, sensitive (among others, my skin takes the habit of breaking out in hives when it doesn't like something I eat or put on my skin), SD/PD-prone. OSPW. Fitzpatrick IV. Freckles and PIH from hives.

**Your opinion:** It has lotion texture and lightweight feeling. There's whitecast upon application that disappears within seconds. The ss dries a bit tacky and quite shiny after 20 minutes just like slathering on moisturizer, but complete dry down after about an hour is skin like and completely invisible. Besides, the tack and shine can very easily be taken care of by dusting of loose powder. It will stay skin-like with barely any oil outbreak throughout the day.
It feels quite moisturizing (but not suffocating at all), only hydrator underneath would suffice. 

I experience some very mild stinging sensation a couple times (I'm on my 5th day) and once I got peelies on my skin (I get them when my skin gets irritated by a product). However, that's when I was still layering SebaMed Clear Face Care Gel underneath. For some reason, the gel moisturizer started to feel quite uncomfortable on my skin after recovering from recent avobenzone-induced irritation. I feel no other uncomfortable sensation otherwise.
I also got no clogs (despite the Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol combo, SLES and Benzoic Acid) or any SD/PD flareups. I would still advise this with caution to clog/acne-prones, though.

I also noticed that my facial skin looks brighter and my hyperpigmentation marks (freckles and PIH) started to fade a bit. I'm convinced that the protection this sunscreen provides is more than adequate. Since it's a Danish product and they have to conform to EU regulations, this ss has at least PPD 10 since they have the UVA circle sign on the tube.

It has only been 5 days, but usually I can tell if a product wreaks havoc to my skin already. I'm still going to give this ss a few more days before reaching any conclusion. I will update accordingly. But so far, I'm very happy with the sunscreen and I'm going to buy more tubes as backup.

The way I look at it you only need enough outside of a pension to last you until retirement age so it's a fairly easy calculation, simply take the number of years and multiply by your yearly spending and that's what you need accessible.  You can include this when doing your calculations as during the time you're spending this any other money you have will be sitting untouched so should hopefully be appreciating.  This is a slightly pessimistic calculation as the entire portfolio should be appreciating so you should have some left outside of a pension when you hit 55 (or 57).  Whilst the tax advantages of doing this are huge the flexibility is fairly low and you are limited by how much you can have in a pension pot so it's probably best not to be quite that extreme.

The other variables for me are what tax bracket you're in and where you are in relation to the lifetime allowance, right now I'm able to reduce my income tax threshold (and therefore pay a lower marginal rate) by making higher pension contributions which is another factor to consider.  In a few years time however I might not be earning an amount that doesn't let me do that and also be closer to the threshold so at that point I'll scale back my pension and send the money elsewhere.

The one major thing in the UK however is housing, purely because it's just so expensive.  You should work out what you want here and factor that into the sums from an early start.

It's been a damn meme for decades that prices will always drop right after you've given up waiting and bought expensive hardware - I remember people bitching about how much they'd saved if they'd just waited *one more month* all the way back when I was a kid in the early 80's.

We're no longer tied to the land, we no longer have obligations to work for a lord, the church doesn't dominate our lives and enforce the status quo, etc. etc.  Even dear old Marx was a fan of the change from feudalism to capitalism.  However, there is one area where slavery was arguably better than feudalism and feudalism was better than capitalism, and that's in the obligations and responsibilities that the owner/lord felt towards his slaves/serfs.  In terms of slavery, unless they were treated as disposable or sacrificial, this was a proprietary interest, where, assuming the cost of slaves was reasonably high, they had to be fed and watered as they were an investment and their lifespan and ability to work was an issue.  In some slave-owning societies, slaves were treated pretty well, almost as members of the family, and across a lifetime could look forward to being educated, trained, and ultimately set free, even with some independent wealth or land when their owners died.  In feudal times, this blossomed into a paternalistic relationship of duties and mutual obligations steeped in religion and tradition.

&gt; ""The defendants are not a religious organisation. They are a business for profit. There are no exceptions available.â

I guess the judge felt that the bakery failed to adhere to the need to âprovide service to allâ (in practice, not to discriminate on grounds of demographic). If this is a fair interpretation of the law it surely means that a secular bakery would be obliged to make a cake that protested against gay marriage on religious grounds, even if they themselves disagreed with that message.

I'm an atheist who supports gay marriage, but it is absurd that a business is obliged to promote political messages that it disagrees with. As others have said, presumably the bakery would have refused whoever had been ordering the cake. I'm not sure if this verdict is a lapse on the judge's part or the law's part, but it is ridiculous either way.

If someone wants to be homophobic, that's on them. Customers will vote with their wallets one way or the other.

But this sets a legal precedent that I am none too happy with.

If I were a baker, would I now be legally obligated to make a cake that contains a message I disagree with, under threat of criminal charges being brought against me?

&gt;__Rush goalie__, also known as a __fly goalie__ or __fly keeper__, is a variation of [football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_(soccer\)) in which the role of the [goalkeeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper) is more flexible than normal. The goalkeeper position is taken by a player who can run out of and leave his [goal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_(sport\)) to actively participate in outfield play. However when defending the player returns to his goal and takes up the role of goalkeeper once again, in rush goalie only one player can be the goalkeeper and handle the ball. Once the danger has passed, that player (the ""rush goalie"") returns to normal outfield play. Rush goalie is only played in informal football matches, usually by children, and often when the players want to play a more active role in the game than the position of goalkeeper would normally allow; it can also be applied when the when the number of players per side is low.

They **all** fail this criterion, but some more often than others. The fact that they fail is not an issue itself, but how often (and people have argued up to 15% of the time, but most seem to say ~10%).

Lets say there are 30 votes for a single winner to make life easier (works the exact same way though). People vote the following:

| Order Preference| Count|
|:---:|:---:|
| A &gt; B &gt; C | 11
| B &gt; C &gt; A | 10
| C &gt; A &gt; B | 9

No candidate has reached 30 yet, so the group with the least first primary votes (C) is excluded and its votes redistributed. **A then gets 20 votes and wins.**

Now lets take the same situation, but it's found that two of the BCA votes were actually marked ABC. In other words, A has been moved to the top on 2 ballots without messing with the order of the other choices. Now we have:

| Order Preference| Count|
|:---:|:---:|
| A &gt; B &gt; C | 13
| B &gt; C &gt; A | 8
| C &gt; A &gt; B | 9

This time **B** is excluded first, so first votes for B are redistributed. All their second votes are for C, **so C gains 17 votes (greater than 15) and is declared the winner.**

So those two people voting for A first instead of second of third choice harmed their candidate's chances of winning.

This is called the monotonicity criterion and is a really weird concept. It's why I don't like STV though. I do not know of any multiple-winner systems that match this criterion but they may be out there. However there are single winner systems that avoid this issue which is why I prefer them.

null,false,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,null,"I think the kneejerk reaction to Raheem Sterling is: *Who the fuck do you think you are?*

Right?

I mean, that is *my* kneejerk reaction.

The basic points of our collective outrage seems to be pretty clear:

* Raheem Sterling is paid 35k/wk.
* Sterling allegedly wants 100k/wk.
* Sterling's performance/statistics do not justify 100k/wk relative to others who are paid that amount.
* Where does Sterling get off demanding (allegedly) 100k/wk?

Here's where Sterling and his representatives have gone wrong:

* They are not asking for 100k/wk based on *past* performance; services already rendered.
* They are asking for for that amount based on the *potential* of Sterling who is only 20-years-old with seemingly *limitless* potential.

So, if you're Liverpool FC... what do you do?

* Stand firm and lose a young player poised for greatness?
* Or pay for the potential?

We've seen the good and bad from both scenarios:

* Stand firm and lose the player who goes off and becomes great.
* Stand firm and retain the player... and he becomes great and the club has lucked out because we now have value for money.
* Stand firm and retain the player... and he is piss-poor, and the club has lucked out because we dodged a bullet.
* Similarly, pay the player what he wants and with greatness comes the ""wise"" justification of his wages; But with failure comes the criticism of those wages.

In situations like this, it becomes difficult for supporters to gain a clear understanding of the situation because the ""facts"" from the club or the player are always filtered through the media.

And at this point, it all becomes confusing and it's difficult to figure out who we can actually trust:

* The club? Ah, yes, the club, the massive business/corporation who always has the best interests of their players and staff, right? The club who is always ""loyal""?
* The player? The greedy player who is lucky to be paid to play the game that we love?
* The media? We so often criticise the media and now we're suddenly supposed to accept that what they report from the club or the player is true? Aren't they the same bastards who twist the truth simply to sell papers and get clicks on their website?

And this is where I start to see the complexities of this issue and think about who stands to win or lose especially in the context of the media...

* Would the media side with a 20-year-old player and help him?
* Or would they side with the club who will outlast any player? After all, the career of a journalist is much longer than the career of a player.

So, in my opinion, the completely unsatisfying answer is that all sides are at fault:

* Raheem Sterling and his agents have likely overplayed their hand.
* While Liverpool FC has underplayed their hand.

But the club and their association with the media can always control the story. And this is where I feel a bit of sympathy for Sterling.

* Who knows what promises the club made to Sterling.
* And Sterling's ""poor"" season coupled with public opinion on the club's side, any disagreement from Sterling can easily be seen as ungrateful.
* Therefore, the club has the leverage in contract negotiations, the upper hand.

I'm no expert on all this but I have followed professional sport for a very long time, I have a journalism background, and I'd like to think I can read between the lines and extract a more clear narrative of this entire situation.

In my opinion:

The 20-year-old Raheem Sterling is an unfortunate and innocent pawn in a petty power play between the club and Sterling's representatives.

I believe Sterling's representatives felt as if the club is weakened and desperate especially after falling short of the title last season, falling short of the Champions League this season, losing Luis Suarez to Barcelona, losing Daniel Sturridge to injury, losing Steven Gerrard to the MLS. This belief is further reinforced by LFC's inability to secure higher profile players and the club's reliance on Sterling week in and week out.

Because of that belief, Sterling's representatives feel as if they can secure a massive payday for Sterling. And, of course, for themselves.

However, they misjudged the resolve of the new ownership who only just started to bring LFC out of a dire financial situation, and were burned by their naivety when they over-spent on various players.

At this point, public opinion would have been: Fuck, we can't lose, Sterling! Pay the kid!

The crucial mistake/gamble from Sterling's representatives was to hold their ground. At this point, they should have just accepted the contract and simply re-ignited a contract discussion a season or two later when/if Sterling puts together a brilliant season.

Liverpool's brilliant move was to hold their ground.

And then public opinion shifted.

And, at this point, this is where we see the cruel and dangerous power of a big club as the club gradually release information on Sterling's refusal to sign a new contract. Where the media side with the stable club as opposed to the petulant kid. Then ambassadors of the club like Steven Gerrard, Jamie Carragher, John Barnes, etc. raise their voice and their opinion from the media platform they have.

And why would the media risk getting Sterling's side of the story? Why would the media risk angering the club and risk losing access to the club for years to come? Especially for a player who could be gone this summer? Or due to an unfortunate injury? Or simply not live up to what he was supposed to be?

Suddenly, the young and naive Sterling realises his once-strong public support is gone. And the club now have the upper hand.

Sterling's representatives stubbornly and foolishly double-down... Now Sterling is 'bullied' by the club! It's not Sterling who is disloyal, but the club!

Too late.

Those words fall on unsympathetic ears who believe Sterling has hardly justified the wages that he is currently on (which is also silly but a different discussion).

To conclude:

* Sterling and his representatives had quite a cheek to ask for 100k/wk.
* And they could have gotten it too if they kept their mouths shut.
* But they didn't.
* And now the tables have turned.
* But don't be fooled: The club could have very easily paid Sterling, but of course, being a business, they won't want to.
* But the missteps from Sterling's camp helped the club.
* And with the power of the media behind them, the club can now change the narrative to their favour no matter what the truth really is.
* And at this point, the truth doesn't really matter since public opinion is always set.

I think Sterling deserves 100k/wk based on his potential. And I think Sterling would prove his worth too.

But Sterling and his representatives fucked up the public relations battle and it may cost them dearly. While many Champions League caliber clubs can afford the transfer fee and Sterling's wages, Sterling will ultimately lose because he will likely not have the crucial playing time necessary in the his early 20s to grow and evolve as a player. The risk of rotting on the bench is very real.

Meanwhile, caught in the middle is poor 20-year-old Raheem Sterling. An extremely talented boy who just wants to go out and play the game he loves.

And in the shadows are the grown-ups who are poised to fuck it all up and potentially leave Raheem Sterling as a footnote in our history and finding himself in future /r/LiverpoolFC threads about forgotten footballers who could have been great.",null,0,null,1432034612,null,0,false,0,crdxr2e,null,t3_36evwm,null,t1_crdxr2e,null,t3_36evwm,null,null,null,1433146550,null,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null

Slavery is a legal or economic system under which people are treated as property. While laws and systems vary, as property, slaves may be bought and sold. Slaves can be held from the time of their capture, purchase or birth, and deprived of the right to leave, to refuse to work, or to demand compensation.

I'm making the point that however crap it might be if you were having to work for your benefits, and the benefits not being much money, it is not like slavery.

But I think giving him a chance against Burnley would be a good idea. Gil has had an injury which may have hampered his progress but he is not rated by Sherwood. This could be due to a language barrier or as mentioned earlier he is an 'icing on the cake player'. Selling Gil will be a big mistake, at the very least loan him out to Middlesbrough or a newly promoted club and give him a chance.

Sanchez: Based on Sherwood's short managerial experience, he hasn't played defensive midfielders too much. He much prefers central midfielders, which is why we have been seeing Westwood, Delph and Cleverly often playing together. I think there is still a spot for Sanchez in the team. Especially when the defence needs more protection.

Lastly, I'm a fan of Vlaar. Despite whatever people say he has made an impact through out they years and while Baker and Clark have been developing, Vlaar had stepped in and did a good job. I think his future is affecting his performances but I still think that alongside Senderos, Vlaar plays really well.

I agree, fear of being labelled politically incorrect is a fantastically lame excuse for ignoring widespread abuse and is really only being trotted out by people who want to use Rotherham to push an anti-immigration agenda. 

This story suggests there may have been other, more sinister reasons for the abuse going unreported and it's ridiculous that it's not drawing more interest given how hot a topic Rotherham is in reddit political subs.

That's assuming he/she was guilty,  and it misses the point.  It does not deter.

This sounds like something a dictator might say.  In reality all justice systems are fallible

&gt; c) Depends on your definition of justice. Making the offender feel a bit of the pain they put their victims through, or otherwise making the victims and their families feel better, perhaps a sense of closure, can be considered a form of justice.

Not all relatives of victims feel this way.

This is opinion, but it is more like cold murder than killing to protect.

The public have been ambiguous about it, but it's my belief that if there were ever a referendum on this, the resultant debate would inform the public about the facts, and opinion would be overwhelmingly against it

Interesting comment on Sanchez. Definitely gives the ball away more than he should, but don't you think he really has potential?

The Vlaar thing is probably more an issue of the whole defensive lineup rather than just him. It's just that he has so much hype with everyone talking about how heaps of clubs want him and such.

One word or little phrase can change the entire message. By saying that Raheem turned the offer down and that it was a fantastic offer, he's turning all of the attention and blame onto the player. That's the exact opposite of protecting the player.

Gil wants to win in style whereas Sherwood just wants a positive result whichever way possible, and there are other players in the squad who can do that. Is that an opinion that is shared by the fans? Probably not.
  
**Second:** Sanchez, for me at the moment is a solid backup player, but that's about it. The midfield we have going with Delph, Cleverly and Westwood is just too good to be throwing anyone else in unnecessarily.   

**Third:** Vlaar. Ugh. A year or so ago and I would have said he was the best player in our squad but now he just doesn't seem up to it. The only contract I want to see him sign is one for another club. We have Clark and Okore who are working well together, and Baker and Senderos as backup.

These exports and imports exclude financial services.  

So Japan is equal in importation and exportation, the uk imports far more than it exports.  So yes the UK economy may be hurt by not having a Free Trade Agreement, it is also true that the EU countries will be hurt far more than the UK is.  



Will we have the same power? 

Well, we're only one of 5 nations with a permanent seat on the UN Security Council with Veto power, We already hold seats on the IMF and will on china's version of the IMF, although Europe wants to remove that IMF seat and act as one voice for 28 EU countries.  

We would regain our WTO seat.  So the question isn't ""Will we have the same power"" it's how much more power will we have.  We'll continue to be a independent voice on trade, security, money councils worldwide, without being beholden to EU policies.  


As I've said, if we exist in the Status Quo, our power inside europe will diminish as pro-eu countries forge stronger ties, overriding the UKs wishes, and we would have to just suck it up.  We leave the European Project and we regain so much more freedom.  Do we lose some political power inside the EU?  Yes, but did we actually have that much?  We regain more power outside the EU as other countries now have to negotiate directly with us, rather than just cater to the largest voting bloc in the EU council.

The over the top signing of youth is the big problem in my opinion. FSG sign a lot of potential and barely any first team/top class talent. And a lot of those potential talents have failed.

Coates, Ilori, Luis Alberto all fails so far. There's more I can't think of right now. We're falling behind the rest of the pack above us at some speed.

The strategy needs to change if we want to compete. That strategy involves money and spending it on the best talent - providing we can attract it.

Youth is great, but it needs supplementing with top class, experienced talent. The more we invest in youth and wait and hope till that talent/potential blossoms and the more time we do not buy some top players - the more we will see instances of Suarez and Sterling wanting to leave...in Suarez' case we couldn't realise his ambition - it might be different with Sterling. The truth is in the article, we've won fuck all, albeit one trophy in nine years.

I think FSG are decent owners, but if they don't have the financials to sign the best players then maybe its time to think about putting the club up for sale rather than leaving us in mediocrity and falling further and further behind the teams above us.
Reading that felt like being kicked in the balls repeatedly.

Something needs to change before it becomes too late to catch the teams above us.

I FEEL A NEEDTO MAKE ONE THING VERY CLEAR AS MOST PEOPLE HERE SEEM TO BE RAGING WITHOUT READING THE ARTICLE. PEOPLE ARE BEING PAID TO WORK WITH CHARITIES! NOT LARGE BUSINESSES. PAID FOR WORKING IN WHAT WOULD BE VOLUNTARY ROLES! 

THIS ISN'T SOME BIG BUSINESSES SCAM! 


1) employability - its a known fact that long term unemployed people find it much harder to get work than those just out of a job. Also, for people with no experience (like myself) finding a job can be hard. I chose to volunteer in charity shops for experience, this provides the same with some financial benefit. It also gets people into the routine, so when in proper employment they are more able to cope. 

2) Stops the scroungers - I know it's a minority, but trust me, I went to a decent school in my area, and a fair few people in my year expressed their desire to leave school and go on benefits. Never had an intention of working. 

The wage is a little low admittedly if you break it down, but this isn't designed to be a solution to a problem. The governments aim is to get people into employment and earn a living through the private sector, not through the government. This encourages that by making benefits for young people an emergency stop gap rather than a solution. 

I know barely anyone will read this and it'll get burried,  but there's my 2 cents. Feel free to disagree

Edit 2: apparently I have to quote the article linked in order for people to believe what I'm saying! 

""The proposals would put young adults who have been out of work, education or training for six months (âneetsâ) into compulsory community work such as making meals for the elderly or joining local charities.""

You initially claimed how long it's been since you drank is ""irelevant"", and that's wrong.

If you last drank over 24 hours ago, (NOT the night before), and you test positive, then something else is in play, or you were drinking heroic amounts of booze.

[Nurses test positive due to sanitising gel.](http://post.health.ufl.edu/2011/07/19/a-positive-test-without-drinking/)

[Diabetes can create a false positive.](http://www.diabeteshealth.com/uncategorized/dui-or-diabetes/)  The same principle means anyone on a Keto diet would generate the same false result.

[Asthma can.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1172108/)  Although to be fair, the police are supposed to ask if you recently used an inhaler.

So a method by which you could prove when the person last drank would be very useful.  It is far from the ""irrelevance"" you claim.

# Research Findings

&gt; Impairment in critical driving begins at very low levels.

Â­
&gt; The relative risk of being involved in a fatal crash as a driver is **up to 10 times** greater for drivers with BACs between **0.05 and 0.07g/dL**, compared with drivers with 0.00g/dL.

Â­
&gt; Drivers have a considerable higher risk of being involved in a collision **(18%)** at **0.04G/dL**

# Effectiveness of Lower Limit

&gt; After the introduction of
&gt; 0.05g/dL or lower:
&gt;
&gt; - **Netherlands** â sustained
&gt; decline in number of drinking
&gt; drivers involved in collisions
&gt; (15% to 12%) (1974)
&gt;
&gt; - **France** â reduction of 36% in 
&gt; alcohol-related collisions
&gt; (1996)
&gt; 
&gt; - **Austria** â 9% decline in
&gt; alcohol related crashes
&gt; (1988)
&gt; 
&gt; - **New South Wales** â 13%
&gt; decline in alcohol- related
&gt; collisions at weekends (1994)
&gt; 
&gt; - **Queensland** â 18%
&gt; reduction in fatal collisions
&gt; and 14% in serious injury
&gt; collisions (1982)
&gt; 
&gt; - **South Australia** â reduced
&gt; night time drinking drivers by
&gt; 14% (1991)
&gt; 
&gt; - **Japan** â reduced both
&gt; alcohol-related collisions and
&gt; drinking drivers (1970)
&gt; alcohol related fatal collision
&gt; drooped [sic] from 15% to 11%
&gt; when BAC of 0.03g/dL was
&gt; introduced in 2007.
&gt; 
&gt; - **Denmark** â increase in
&gt; number of drivers who no
&gt; longer consumed alcohol
&gt; while driving from 71% to
&gt; 80% (1998)
&gt; 
&gt; - **Sweden** â reduction of 9.7%
&gt; in fatal crashes, 11% in
&gt; single vehicle collisions and
&gt; &amp; in overall collisions (1997)
&gt; 
&gt; - **Switzerland** â reduction in
&gt; alcohol-related fatalities by
&gt; 44% (2005)

Essentially, the price has doubled because although demand is still high, there are a lot more dealers and therefore the demand per supplier is significantly reduced.

So you're saying that redditors with downvotes are censoring you, but the government is incapable of that same task?
I think every party has too much optimism in their plans and it will cost 10-20% over their projections.

the government is like the mods. They can ban stuff, and *need* the power to ban stuff in the case of seductive narratives that brainwash people into becoming violent, such as holocaust denial and Islamofascist narratives.
They can't stop these ideas, it just makes it more difficult. Things that need to come out, eventually will- Labour could only hide mid-staffs until the Tories got in. The Mirpuri rape gangs came out eventually, even after the idea had long been poo-pooed by the mainstream media. I am doubtful that either party will be able to keep the establishment paedophiles under wraps indefinitely now the cat is out of the bag.

I still think acclimatising from Spanish football to English football is a massive swing.

I do think Sanchez has potential, I'm not writing him off completely... I just think we have better players in our squad right now.

Vlaar was under most peoples radar until the world cup... He wasn't really rated at all. Sure he had a good time at the world cup which got peoples lips flapping, but the same way people (outside of Villa) forgot Benteke existed for half a season there... If you mentioned the name Kozak to anyone else they'd look at you like you were talking nonsense... Granted he was only in the squad for 3 months before breaking his leg, it's the same kind of thing. If he came back and had a Kane-esque start to the season everyone would be saying he is the next big thing... He could equally go straight off the boil (just like Kane... heh.)

Rambling a little bit, but hope that makes sense. Players can come in and out of favour very quickly to people outside of our own club. I think Vlaar's ego after that made him think he was better than he was, and he considered himself bigger than the club. Clark is better than Vlaar in our defensive setup in my opinion... The Clark/Baker and Clark/Okore partnership was more effective than anything with Vlaar in the squad.

The good thing about a pension is that you get tax relief on it. If you are paying income tax in the UK, then any contribution you make (not any your employer makes) can be offset from your tax bill. The extra will either be added directly to your pension account or you can claim it back through a tax return, depending on which tax bracket you are in. As an example, if you are a higher rate tax payer, then every Â£60 you add to a pension will be immediately increased by Â£40 (instant 67% gain!). 

The problem is that pension money is locked up in a way that is a money isn't. You can't access it without penalty until you reach a certain age. 

I guess the answer is to add to a pension if you are confident that you won't need it until that age. If you have doubts about when you will draw on the money, which there will be if you want to retire early, then the isa had more flexibility.

Probably wouldn't work, why? Because they then wouldn't offer these placements to job seekers, they just want temporary help and nothing more.

What about Arsenal? They consistently get top 4, who on their team is so much better than ours? 

And also read what I wrote - I believe the manager is a key issue here, not our owners, not our scouting system, the manager. He's not a big name, he's not a superstar. Think about if you were going for a job and you could work under a proven manager who's got a lot of experience and is going to develop your career or one known to freeze people out he has a problem with, who would you work for? and stuck being mediocre for too long? That's no one's fault currently at the club, we were on the brink of 'doing a Portsmouth' until FSG rescued us. Of course under Hicks and Gillett the club stagnated but I very much think we are doing better than then.

1\. It's not that the speech is more accessible

This is my claim.

This means that this decision was the outcome of a court case.

3\. It is harder to prove that you didn't discriminate against a protected class if the person you refused to serve is a member of that protected class.

This is what I claim is the implication of the decision, which seems reasonable. In other words, you are free to refuse to make whatever cake you like, but if that refusal could reasonably be interpreted as discrimination against a protected class then you should be careful as you might be breaking the law.

4\. It's not like they got away with something.

This reiterates: it's not a decision which gives gay people carte blanche to order gay-rights cakes. It's a rather more subtle decision which implies that if there is reasonable grounds to claim that your actions could be discriminatory, you should be careful.

Look, I'm not talking about marginal cases or ticking off some kid for stealing a loaf of bread. I would suggest cases like the Moors murderers or Soham Murders.

If you disagree with the law then petition against it. I doubt you'll find much support for legalising the abduction and murder of children though. If you disagree with the verdict and have no evidence to support that, then I would question why you disagree with it.

Yes, there are elements of subjectivity to it, but I have yet to come across any society that did not outlaw murder. Many of those societies did have some concept of lawful murder, i.e. in the name of the law or in case of self defence.

I would argue for the death penalty only in cases of extreme behaviour (.e.g serial rapists that were unusually cruel to their victims, serial killers) which I why I said I would imagine this to be a once a decade affair rather than a daily occurrence. 

I would also suggest that locking up people for life with no chance of parole is a cruel and unjust punishment and that those criminals should be given the option of taking a death penalty after an amount of time. I struggle to see how it is in societies benefit to keep people incarcerated with the sole intention of seeing them die there.

Instead, the judge has found (having spent the whole trial looking at all of the facts) that these bakers discriminated against their potential customer for being gay. No matter how much they have claimed that they didn't care about his sexuality and only had a problem with the message, the judge didn't believe this.

My name's [name] I'm [age] years old and I work in [industry] in [location].

I understand that your image is boosted by appearing to be associated with the event, but I'd argue that at this point you are risking associated negative pressânaturally any sponsors of this event will receive a grilling in the media, for helping to whitewash the image of a country which itself deals in slavery, corruption, misogyny and homophobiaâand you would likely generate more positive press by opting out (potentially being marked as the first domino in a trend of sponsorship withdrawal.) 

If this sponsorship continues, thousands â myself included â will be involved in spreading negative press towards not only the event and Qatar, but all those who sponsor it, so it's only fair to alert you to this eventuality.

People are looking at this in the wrong way. Sterling ain't as good as he thinks he is, sure, but he's still one of our best players at 20 and already his ambitions have outgrown the clubs. That is frightening but instead everyone is pointing the finger at Sterling and saying we are best for his 'development.' Fuck that shit, I don't want this club to become a place where players stop off on the way to fulfilling their abilities. 

Unfortunately under FSG that's what we are, their whole motto is about buying cheap and young and selling at maximum profit. That has always irked me a bit, it's okay to buy young and nurture players into first team regulars, but we are nurturing youngsters for richer teams' benefits just so FSG can turn a quick buck, and most of our fans seem okay with it because we have a 'philosophy.' The hiring of Rodgers and continuing backing of him is proof of this. He's a manager who knows how to develop young talent but has little to no experience or know-how in actually winning anything.

I think people affected by the troubles, specifically people affected by murders ordered on Adam's command, at the very least deserve an apology that acknowledges his role in the bloodshed.

You have brought into SF propaganda that Adams was not in the PIRA. They may no longer support the PIRA but for the party to move on Adams must acknowledge his past.

I have also spoken to staunch SF supporters who have acknowledged Adams past. Why can't you?

null,false,Summerdown,eng-lancashire,Lancashire,null,"&gt; For an example of this, imagine the UK top tax bracket is 50% and 1 million wealthy people choose to live in the UK under these circumstances. Now imagine the tax rate is reduced to 40% and now 2 million wealthy people choose to live here. Well 40% of 2 million is more than 50% of 1 million. 

Doesn't all this assume:

a) That the rich pay tax sufficient to make the difference, and don't use tax evasion to avoid paying the great bulk of what might be expected. Those new 1 million rich immigrants may not contribute as much as the first 1 million proportionately due to their pre-existing use of overseas loopholes, etc.

b) That the total is increased by bringing tax rates down.

For example, I can do the opposite example:

 imagine the UK top tax bracket is 50% and 1 million wealthy people choose to live in the UK under these circumstances. Now imagine the tax rate is *increased* to 60% and now 0.9 million wealthy people choose to live here. Well 60% of 0.9 million is more than 50% of 1 million.

The reason I put it like this is that it's often an article of faith amongst the right that putting tax rates down does in fact save more than it costs, because of ""rich people leaving,"" but I've yet to be convinced this has been proven to any level greater than ""my gut tells me it's right.""

Besides, I find it interesting that despite all their attempts to portray themselves as devout Christians, I drive past their bakery on a regular basis and they're happily baking on a Sunday evening. You'd have thought such devout Christians wouldn't possibly consider working on a Sunday?

What annoys me more is the unionist politicians here getting in a flap and promising legalisation to 'rebalance' (ie, add clauses to allow religious discrimination) things.

If it was, for example, 3 weeks of 30 hours a piece, on a reasonable hourly wage and then a return to benefits if you complete the job successfully, I think it could be quite reasonable. In this case the young person gets the chance to try work and learn how to work. They might even feel quite pleased with the extra money in their pocket and decide to try harder to find work rather than languishing on benefits.

There are two massive problems with the way Cameron's policy has been set out, aside from the obvious unfairness of it. First that it will make those taking part resentful of work. It's not like the people taking part don't realise that perhaps the people working alongside them in the shop are getting paid 4 or 5 times what they are.

Dear Sir/Madam,

My name's [name], I'm [age] years old and I work in [industry] in [location]. I've been made aware via a front-page entry on Reddit.com (which receives 162,000,000 unique visitors per month) of recent revelations regarding Qatari slave labour and the imprisonment of a BBC journalist attempting to report on it, and I wondered if this news had reached you?

I understand that your image is boosted by appearing to be associated with the event, but I'd argue that at this point you are risking associated negative pressânaturally any sponsors of this event will receive a grilling in the media, for helping to whitewash the image of a country which itself deals in slavery, corruption, misogyny and homophobiaâand you would likely generate more positive press by opting out (potentially being marked as the first domino in a trend of sponsorship withdrawal.)

If this sponsorship continues, thousands â myself included â will be involved in spreading negative press towards not only the event and Qatar, but all those who sponsor it, so it's only fair to alert you to this eventuality. Technically as negative press drove me to write this email, it has already begun.

It is tricky to find a balance, you always want to pay in enough to get any employer match, you want to calculate it so that you approach the limit so you want to pay in over the minimum to make full use of the limit but in order for your money to have longest to grow you want to take that tax break as soon as possible.  It could mean for example paying in the maximum until the age of 42, taking the employer match only until retirement at 45 and then aiming to be somewhere near the limit at 57 - but you need to commit to a decision at 42, a full 15 years in advance.

That's only a secondary consideration for me however as I'm currently carrying mortgage debt so I'm only planning to contribute at that level whilst it affects my tax bracket and when it doesn't I'll use the money to overpay the mortgage instead.

Overall I don't see the lifetime allowance as a big issue (and it'll be index linked from 2018), I may end up hitting it and the tax rate seems high but you've got to bear in mind that if I don't hit that I'll have to pay other tax, sooner.

Depends. Who tells the employee what to do? Who sets goals? Who conducts performance reviews?

I also had more access to rooms and systems than some of my co-workers who were proper employees of the company

The only thing the contracting firm did was payroll and bonuses/expenses (which were signed off by my manager). The only visible difference was the colour of my ID card.  Other differences were that I couldn't join the same pension scheme and couldn't buy cheap shares

This season was our make or break season. We had the chance to break into the CL, make an impact and also try to get a leg up on our rival in the PL who were undergoing transition. 

Failing to sign Sanchez was, for me, the biggest statement in how far we have fallen. Barcelona wanted Suarez and would meet a ridiculous buy out clause, the incentive was there, but we couldn't convince Sanchez to be part of the deal.

The sad fact is we are on the decline. I don't believe we have the appeal to make the signings that are needed to breach the top 4 and get back into CL. We have missed our chance to re-establish ourselves back in the European elite.

I personally blame Ian Ayre and the transfer committee. I think it's a horrible experiment which needs to end.

null,false,DefluousBistup,null,null,null,"Just to supplement your point: If a company is paying below a living wage, the employees must claim benefits to top up their wage to survive. So, the tax payer is subsidising the companies that pay below a living wage. Companies that pay below the living wage will be the market leaders, so we are giving firms market power - not what you want to do in a capitalist system. To take this even further, government contracts that go to the lowest bidder are naturally those that pay below a living wage. So while the government thinks it's getting a bargain, it forgets that it is subsidising the wages in the first place, so they pay twice for the same service: the lowest bidder is not the most efficient. 

I find it impossible to think that the government doesn't know this, so it's even worse. It's blatant corruption in my opinion.

The current legislation would normally equate to not prosecuting people for refusing to help campaign against it. I'm not sure there's any legislation where disagreeing with an idea is an automatic slight on any minority that it involves. It's possible for someone to be against a Palestinian state without it automatically making them anti-Palestinian, just as one can be anti-Israel without being antisemitic - which is why we don't prosecute people on that basis.

&gt;There are no equivalent laws for this situation.

Well, there are laws in the country they live and work in - laws which discriminate against gays getting married. Take that away, and these people will have no excuse. But not until then.

&gt; One is legal, one is not. That's accurate.

But apparently, supporting one is legal and supporting the other isn't. Even if the one you don't support is illegal. That's daft.

&gt;What is illegal is discriminating against a customer on grounds of sexual orientation. 

Which hasn't been proved. All that's been proved is that they don't agree with gay marriage, something legislated against by the state.

&gt; they haven't helped themselves by saying ""it's against our religious beliefs"".

Gay marriage *is* against their religious beliefs. Nowhere do they say 'we wouldn't have served him anyway, because being gay is against our religious beliefs'. And nowhere is it evident that that happened.

No way has only one team scored more than 5 goals from counter attacks this season, Chelsea must have nearly scored that many in the game against us on Goodison. I blame whoscoreds weird definition of counter attacks.

As for our squad. You build a team either to fit the style of football you want to play, or fit a style to the players you have. 
Our current squad whilst largely a result of Moyes' work is slowly turning into a Martinez team. My impression was always that Moyes worked with what he had and played the opponent with a basic core of a style that was agile enough to fit any match. I wouldn't describe it as a typically counter attacking football team.
Martinez has a style he likes and an approach that has to do with his players qualities, and he works to develop the skills and abilities so that we can outplay our opponent playing our preffered style.

The players he has brought in reveals a plan, the direction is of a team confident in their ability to dominate through possession. Key to the reshaping the team has been to add skilled players in the center of midfield and a goal scorer on a long term contract bolstering our central line. 
 
Under Moyes we tended to surrender the middle, but famously was able to get goals from our very strong players in wide areas either scoring or assisting most of our goals. Classic, simple and effective. Attacking wing backs supporting our midfield is so well known it's usually the first thing that comes into peoples minds when they hear Everton. The last seasons under Moyes the style evolved with the ability to combine short passes with extra manpower in wide areas resulting in the partnership of Baines and Pienaar. Everton had layed down some groundwork under Moyes and this has aided Martinez when starting to tranform Everton to a team playing possession football. We have the ability now to play the ball through the middle of the pitch as well as in the wide areas, adding to our options. 
I'd say we are getting close to a squad that is complete, and can play just about any type of fotball we want

Dear {Company Name},

I'm writing to encourage you to revoke your sponsorship of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Even in the face of clear human rights violations, intense public pressure, and four thousand deaths, FIFA has done little to effectively address abusive and exploitative labor being used to build the stadiums and infrastructure for the event.  Rewarding FIFA with continued sponsorship not only encourages their abuse, bribery, and corruption but suggests {Company Name} operates under the same abusive and corrupt policies.

Since money is, obviously, the only language FIFA speaks, I'm asking that you redirect your sponsorship dollars to more honorable events.

Sincerely,

{Your Name}

Lambert - Miss. Was brought in to get goals when our main strikers are injured. He hasn't done it. Lack of playing time just means that the manager didn't rate him. Why he signed him then I have no idea.

Lallana - Mediocre. Mainly due to injuries and has been our best player in the last few games but hasn't completed the full 90 due to lack of fitness. For the price-tag and the return it's hard to say he's been a hit but if he stays injury free he can be a very good player.

Markovic - Too early to tell. He's only 20 and been played out of postion all season.

Lovren - Mediocre. Terrible at the start of the season but has settled into the team as the season progressed. But for 20m you expect a hell of a lot more.

Moreno - Too early to tell. Great going forward, terrible defending. He's only 22 and if he can learn to defend he could become a hit.

Balotelli - Miss. 16m gamble just didn't pay off. He looked good playing alongside Sturridge but a lone striker role just didn't suit him. He's missed so many games for strange reasons and it's clear that Rodgers never wanted him.

Like we should have won the league this year or Sterling is shit anyway and we don't want him or we should get Klopp to replace Rodgers because he's had a worse season than him but did really well in a league where you only have to beat one other team?

It's fascinating stuff.

Rodgers is shit but last season Liverpool won 26 league games - the most in a season since 1987-88.

Equalled a club record of six successive away league wins. But he's shit, can't motivate us.

We won 16 league games at Anfield - our best record since 1985-86. But yeah he's shit.

He took us from 7th to 2nd, which is unheard of before that, but he's shit.

Liverpool scored 101 league goals in the season - a record for the club when we've been in the top tier.

We failed to score in three league games  - the fewest in a league season since 1957-58.

We equalled their club record of 11 successive league wins in a single season (previously achieved in 1982).

He needs to win something rather than breaking records with the club. He's shit.

He lost 50+ goals in Sturridge and Suarez but yeah he's shit.

It's all his fault so get rid of him because he's shit.

If it's all his fault this season for finishing 5th then it's all on him for finishing 2nd last season and breaking record after record. Or was that someone else leading the club then?

You can't have it both ways. Unless you're one of those idiots I previously mentioned who blame the manager for everything wrong but when it goes right it's the players.

As you can see I didn't say Rodgers did all that last season by himself, but Liverpool broke all sorts of records so it was him who did it or it was the players, then it's the same people to praise as you blame this season too.",null,0,null,1432042804,null,0,false,0,cre0uj0,null,t3_36a7a1,null,t1_cre0uj0,null,t1_cre078x,null,null,null,1433148079,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

Hi. My name is [name], and I'm a [occupation] from [state and/or country]. I've been watching and reading the news concerning FIFA's handling of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, and I'm frankly appalled that organization could be so corrupt, especially one with so much international influence. The World Cup in Qatar is a farce. Summer temperatures average 100 degrees Fahrenheit and often reach a shocking 120 degrees, making it not only challenging, but impossible, to play 90 minutes of football. You can be assured that there will be frequent health problems, for both players and fans, as a result of this. Winter temperatures are more moderate, but then you face interrupting league competitions worldwide, which is a logistical nightmare for FIFA and a PR blow to leagues like the Premier League, the Champions League, La Liga, Serie A, and every other major yearly footballing league. Inviting the world to Qatar is potentially problematic for social reasons - everyone knows that the sale of alcohol is inevitable for the world's biggest party, but Qatari law mandates flogging for consumption of alcohol. At the very least, it will be a protracted and controversial negotiation between FIFA and Qatar, akin to the Brazilian ""Budweiser Bill"" that courted international controversy. At the most, it will be a human rights nightmare. On top of all of these reasons, Qatar already is a terrible place for human rights in general - homosexuality is despised and punishable by death, and (here's the biggest problem of all) migrant workers, who are not allowed to leave the country, have been dying - one person every two days, presumably for the next 7 years. 

These statistics are true, and there are millions in football-supporting nations like the US, UK, and Germany who know what is happening and have been sharing their disgust for FIFA's policy towards Qatar and the 2022 World Cup. Whether it's true or not (and if you do some research, you can know that it's definitely true), FIFA is a corrupt organization, and as sponsors, this reflects towards you. Adidas, Gazprom, Visa, Hyundai, Kia, McDonald's, Budweiser, and Coca-Cola are internationally known brands, and I urge you all to remove yourselves from sponsoring FIFA and this farcical World Cup in Qatar. If you continue to sponsor this tournament, you are passively supporting modern slavery, violent homophobia, and widespread corruption. I, along with countless others, will view you with a lower regard, and you can expect a massive blow to company PR, if not a decrease in revenue. I'm just a single person, but you are some of the world's largest and most influential corporations. I see something terribly wrong, and I implore you to see it too. With your influence comes a responsibility to denounce these terrible practices by FIFA and Qatar.
