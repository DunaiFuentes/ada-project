null,false,Psyc5,null,null,null,"&gt; my first job at 15, known people who had them at 23) by the time they pay anything - they used the system for 15+ years without paying anything? Bearing in mind children are far more expensive to the NHS than the average immigrant, this can't be ignored.

A British person born here is paid for by the taxes of their parents, their parents or parent taxes often have to sustain, them as a child, their partner and maybe siblings. But there is other economic value other than taxation, you can be a net loss to the system and still have an essential role, minimum wage works won't add as much as they take out, but their work down is necessary to keep to the system flowing so subsidisation of their existence is necessary, for instance your average shelf stacker, if they don't stack the shelves there is no food to buy, they might not be adding as much as they are taking out monetarily but they are sustaining the system that allows the people with higher paying jobs to work. Their parents are the ones who have paid for this system to exist and grant them access to it, due to past payments and current payments into the system, if they move with their child to another country they no longer have access, but no one is expecting a rebate for the NI they have paid are they?

Each person on average adds a net economic gain or the system falls down, this is mainly achieved by the process of automation and efficiency these days. Where once it took 5 people, now one person and a computer can do the job of 5, so that persons economic efficiency is the equivalent of 5 people in the past (plus computer costs which is negligible), this is why more and more people can become richer there are essentially not finite resources. 

&gt; An immigrant is immediately paying in from their first payslip and unless from the EU can't come here without a job, they never used the system without paying NI (unless they do before the first payslip!). And if from the EU we can recharge their country anyways.

Your average worker at age 30 has been paying more than they took out for probably around 10 years, they haven't been using it, or essentially haven't, maybe they use 20% of the equity they put in, your immigrant hasn't been using it either, but they have put nothing in. This is where the deficit arrives, especially over the long term if that immigrant stays into old age, if they don't or don't get sick before they leave it isn't a problem at all, and you can average out the number who stay against the number who go back to create a fairer system that put less financial burden on new immigrants.

&gt; Immigrants are leaving their home country to pick up the tab, I had free University in Ireland and now I'm here paying my NI, using my degree earned off the Irish taxpayer, and the Irish health service which raised me to my healthy immigrant age to fund your NHS. How does this reconcile with your view? 

That is the system they have chosen to adopt and they have found it to be sustainable (or just ignored its sustainability), given the massive financial crisis in Ireland I am sure I won't be following their example any time soon, also your parents will have paid a large amount for that system, children are under the responsibility of their parents both legally and for the argument of taxation. All you have really proved is that your free system isn't actually sustainable at all, if everyone skills up and then leaves that is going to make for a completely unsustainable economic model in that country. All you have prove is that people should be paying for certain advantages if they are going to take what they can get and run before they have contributed. 

&gt; My home country has a loss, it invested money in me and I fucked off. Britain has gained, you are incorrect my friend.

Your point is irrelevant, the NHS didn't gain. That is the subject, I don't care if Ireland floats off into the Atlantic, I care that the NHS is here in the future, not if Ireland is, maybe you should have spent a bit more time on that education before declaring yourself the winner in an debate that wasn't even occurring and one participate didn't care about in the slightest.",null,0,null,1428373783,null,0,false,0,cq3ou58,null,t3_31msqt,null,t1_cq3ou58,null,t1_cq3nyxn,null,null,null,1432238758,null,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2,null

Non turbo mental nutter Subarus are really capable, well built, AWD, practical vehicles.  For a while the standard Legacy estate was the workhorse car choice of the aristocracy and farmers for good reason, quality utilitarian transport that you could drive across a muddy field without getting stuck.  I had a 3rd generation Legacy Outback that even had a dual ratio gearbox, it was freakishly good at getting up and down icy hills and across snow.  I think early Subarus were imported and sold by tractor dealers which might have helped this reputation come about.

Turbo mental nutter Subarus have an unfortunate baseball cap connotation unfortunately.  They're good vehicles and even more capable than their less adorned naturally aspirated (generally estate body) brethren but the popularity of the rally cars and the fact that they give rally car thrills for a low price attracted the barry boys.

I'm a fan of most of their vehicles, I've owned Legacies and Imprezas of various generations and they're the cars I know best mechanically.  They're unique, every Subaru uses an engine/drivetrain layout that's expensive to produce but very balanced and there's an obvious desire within the company to not compromise on engineering for the sake of cheaper vehicles which I like.

null,false,Clish_Maclaver,null,null,null,"Hello there! I'm relatively new to the Whovian scene myself (only started watching a couple years ago). To answer your question, it depends...

If you plan on starting at episode one from 1963, and you aren't into mid-twentieth-century black-and-white sci-fi aimed at children where the monsters are made out of some combination of cardboard, egg whisks, and plungers, well... yeah, you might have a rough go of it.

If you plan on picking up at episode one from 2005, from the reboot that is, it still might not strike you right. Doctor Who is sort of a unique show. Every few years, one actor steps down and a new one steps in, which changes the dynamic completely! On top of that, every few years, the people working behind the scenes are changing, constantly rotating writers, producers, animators, etc. And that's aside from the fact that every few years, even if the same producers are in charge, they want to change things up a bit, and again, the dynamic of the show shifts.

In general, the current incarnation of the TV show has gone through the following drastic changes:

(1) Reboot begins with Christopher Eccleston as the Doctor, and Rose Tyler (who at the time was sort of Britain's answer to Britney Spears) as the companion. The show has a darker feel to it, and they tried to keep a lot of campiness (cheesy effects and so on...) that gave the original show it's cult following.

(2) In season 2, Eccleston leaves and we find David Tennant. Tennant is a vastly different style of Doctor, and was inspired by his love of the Doctor from his childhood. Often, British polls will rank him as one of the best actors to ever play the Doctor, a real fan favorite (though, if you look at anything recent on Reddit, they might disagree). Rose Tyler is still the companion. The dialogue really picks up in this season, though some of the production style remains vastly unchanged.

(3) Season 3 we see a new companion, Martha Jones. It adds a fresh background and really starts to pull on Doctor Who lore, but it's a little soapy for some. 

(4) Season 4 we get Donna Noble as the new companion. This pairing is often praised by fans as one of the best. If you pick up here, make sure to look up what episodes from this season are stand-alone episodes, because some of the arcs pull from material as far back as Season 2.

(5) There's a two-part special before the start of the 5th Season, and we see the transition from David Tennant to Matt Smith as the Doctor. The special is one of the most popular among Whovians, but I would build up to this one. I don't feel like it would be as meaningful if you don't watch the stuff leading up to Tennant leaving the show. Anyway, Matt Smith makes for an even wackier take on the Doctor, and is also incredibly young, making for an interesting dynamic, considering that the Doctor is hundreds of years old. He finds that his youthful appearance often conflicts with his mental state, causing frequent frustration. Also, at this time, the show has a few other drastic changes. There's a new showrunner (Steven Moffat), a new production crew, new writers, heck the TARDIS even gets a facelift. We also get two new companions, Amy Pond and Rory Williams. The Doctor sees Amy as a little sister of sorts, and makes for a very different change in the Doctor/Companion dynamic.

I will warn you, the Matt Smith/Amy Pond/Steven Moffat dynamic was rather polarizing among viewers. Some loved all of it. Others hated Steven Moffat's style. Others thought Matt Smith didn't do the Doctor justice because he was such an inexperienced actor. Still others didn't like the companions they found in Amy and Rory. And, independent of all of that, some didn't like that suddenly the TARDIS and time travel was being used as the miraculous fix-all *all* the time. They thought it took some of the suspense away. It really is a mixed bag. 

In general, I liked Matt Smith. He might not be my number one, but still fun to watch, and his acting skills improved amazingly over the years. The Doctor's Wife is still one of my favorite episodes of all time. 

I guess, the advice here would be, if you find an episode you didn't like during this period, well, you'll find quite a few avid Whovians who feel the same way, so, don't write the show off just for that. 

(6) Mid-season 7, we end up with a new (and the current) companion, Clara Oswald. Everyone really loved her introduction because she was so very different from the companions of old, mainly in that she was often able to catch the Doctor off-guard. He no longer had his mentor role like he did with Amy and Rory. Clara was much more impetuous, and much more likely to call the Doctor on his sh*t. Admittedly, most fans see the rest of season 7 as sort of weak for Clara, complaining that she was used as a plot device to such an extent that we never really got to know her character. In some ways, this is true, but I still liked the episodes. Also, it should be noted that around this time, Matt Smith's Doctor also became a little more serious and aged, and it sets a much different tone than during his earlier seasons.

(7) In season 8 (the latest season), we again see a new Doctor from Peter Capaldi. Like David Tennant, Capaldi grew up in love with the show and dreaming of being Doctor who, and you can see that in his character a bit. That's about where the comparisons end. Once again, we see a lot change. New TARDIS, a lot of the crew behind the scenes was rotated through (Moffat is still head, though), and the show became a lot darker than in the Matt Smith days. Also, the Doctor is much older and cantankerous. Much angrier. The dialogue is vastly improved in this season (possibly due in no small part to Capaldi being a seasoned stage actor... but who knows for certain). Also, Clara's character gets some much needed TLC, and just about everyone agrees that in season 8, her character was much improved. Admittedly, there was some grumbling about how they ended this latest season, but overall, I'd say it's one of the best since the reboot.

Of course, there are lots of unique specials and characters that I didn't mention, but, ya know, spoilers and all that.

When we applied for my temporary residency visa we did it in person. The process seemed like a lot of queues to nowhere that they put us in so that we would feel better about having paid an extra £400 to apply in person. The woman who checked my paperwork essentially looked at what country I was from, saw my husbands income, and approved us.

It's almost like having a friend to chat with about a show you like when none of your real life friends are into the same shows. Does that make sense?

The idea of watching people watch TV is ridiculous, but somehow works. It's a borders on voyeuristic, but I'm a people-watcher so I get that.

They have such a range of people which makes it easy to find someone you can relate to... But the weird thing about that is that the people I'm supposed to relate to (the gay couple) annoy the hell out of me. I love the family with the girl (university age? Youngish late-30's/early 40's mom and dad). They just crack me up. Leon and June of course, who wouldn't love them? The two black women are awesome, but I feel like they play-up for the cameras sometimes, which is what annoys me about the gay guys (too self-aware). Other groups don't read at all to me, but that's the point: there is something for everyone.

The bigger ""stars"" like Steph and Dom? They're my guilty pleasure. I know they're playing it up more than anyone else on the show but I just kind of love the characters they're putting on, so it is what it is.

I didn't start watching it until after the Celeb Big Brother (which I watch every year) had George Dibbly on, never even heard of it before that.

I'm rambling now, but I guess my view on Gogglebox is this: it's better than anyone would expect it to be for reasons that the viewer can't quite put their finger on.

More fun stories about him are from Newcastle fans.He was their record transfer for 17m I think, and made barely any appearances for them due to injuries he picked up. There was a theory that he'd intentionally played injured in some England games because he was desperate to be the English record goal scorer, and it meant Newcastle lost out on their biggest transfer because of that.

On top of that they were paying him 108k a week and again, during the last year of his contract he started barely trying. Newcastle ended up getting relegated that year, and while they were in crisis he plodded about looking like he didn't care. They offered him an extension to try and incentivise him, but he rejected it and carried on half-arsing perormances until he was eventually dropped at the end of the season, in a time they actually would have really needed a player like him.

He reportedly asked teammates after they were confirmed to be relegated where they were going on holiday over the summer. Some homegrown Geordie players had just had their boyhood club relegated and Owen was sat their on his high wages, asking where they were going holiday.

He also had the cheek to try to claim they never offered him an extension to try and save some of his face.

Torres, Mascherano and Xabi all left due to the financial problems under Hicks and Gillett, to some extent or another. You can make a case that Rafa fucked up badly by freezing Xabi out and pursuing Gareth Barry (still makes me ill to think about), but if we're being honest there is no English club that can expect to hang onto their Spanish players if Madrid come calling. Xabi was no different. 

Suarez was desperate to go to Barcelona and had been for his entire career. I don't think he would have cared if he was making 300k/week at City or wherever, he was always going to leave. 

Before that, well Owen did what he did but he got what he deserved when he jumped ship and Liverpool won the Champion's League the next season. 

Arsenal, on the other hand, there is something deeply disloyal about their players. Van Persie leaving for United without a care in the world, Fabregas jumping ship and then coming back to an in-city rival, Henry getting a glimpse behind the veil of a proper European outfit and transferring. No, Liverpool are not the new Arsenal, Arsenal are Arsenal because they can't hang onto players no matter what they do. Liverpool have had struggles because the club nearly went into administration and Suarez had made his mind up long before he ever came to Merseyside that someday he'd be at the Camp Nou. 

Maybe Sterling will prove me wrong and show that Liverpool do have to sell but somehow I just don't think so. ",null,0,null,1428379717,null,0,false,0,cq3s68e,null,t3_31pg0p,null,t1_cq3s68e,null,t3_31pg0p,null,null,null,1432240329,null,7,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,7,null

**Arsenal**    
Arsenal play only once from now till we meet them, against Burnley (GW 32). If they lose that game and lose to us, they remain on 63 points, with 5 games in hand.

**Man United**    
Man United play Man City (GW 32), Chelsea (GW 33) and Everton (GW 34). If we beat them, and they draw 1 and win 1, they will be on 66 points, with 4 games in hand.

Regardless, it is completely understandable in terms of why Raheem wants to make his financial situation as good as possible while he is still capable of making a lot of money as a footballer.

I know a lot of Liverpool fans who had an issue with Owen after he left given the manner of it, but going to United sealed his status as a Judas. It's something you don't do as a red.

He did definitely go there to get some winners medals. He's posted them on his twitter to people who insult him, which speaks volumes about his character. He still makes some bitter comments about previous dealings with Liverpool and Newcastle which tells me he can't accept any fault in his own behaviour and blames others for not understanding him.

My biggest point of frustration with him is lack of end product honestly. Fine, he doesn't have to score fifteen or even ten goals in what is his first season, but to score one against Burnley is outright unacceptable. This is in a system that demands inside forwards to be fairly prolific and despite Lamela's five league assists, he doesn't have a great goals return and that's the most disappointing part of it. 

Maybe if we tried to run him through the middle we'd see more. I get the vibe that Lamela needs time and space to think about his next step, so considering his release is Dembele-like (that is, sprint for a few yards, look for Harry Kane to feed) and he had a good spell there, I don't see why it might not happen again. 

I'm all for giving him a second season though. I don't think even the most ardent skeptic can doubt how good he is at corners or his pressing/work ethic. If nothing else he's trying and that's the most we can ask out of any player.

null,false,_fernweh_,present,,null,"I'm a bit late to the party but here goes. Sorry for the novel but I guess I have a lot to say. We need to buy depth and rotation options. Our starting XI is one of the best in Europe when in form but after that we are lacking. 

First off, I really like the rumors of us picking up Rob Green to replace the seemingly outbound Petr Cech. He would be a decent enough backup and I wouldn't be too nervous with him filling in for cup games or injuries.

We need a CB. John Terry doesn't have but another couple seasons in him I fear, Cahill doesn't inspire a whole lot of faith from me to marshal our defense going forward, and I  think Zouma is too young right now to be relied on that heavily regardless of talent. I'd like to see us bring in Hummels, honestly. He is a fantastic defender, has leadership qualities, and speaks English already (which I think is an oft-overlooked bonus when considering his ability to bed in with the squad). 

In midfield, I agree with most other posters that we need more reliable players than Ramires in the squad. I would love to get Sami Khedira. He and Mourinho had a good relationship in Madrid and I could see that move appealing to him. If not him then I like the idea of Joao Moutinho (Portuguese connection with Mourinho could be a factor?).

We may need a backup striker if Drogba leaves and we aren't able to sign someone with a similar skill set to Reus or Bale (but not necessarily either of those players) who could fill in if needed as a CF. Keep Bamford out on loan for another season, hopefully with Boro if they come up, so that he can get proper Premier League experience.

Increased integration of the youth players is a must. RLC, Ake, and co. all need more minutes. They are great prospects but we can't let them stagnate. I want to see chances being taken on them.

Finally, I'd like to see us move to a 4-3-3 next season. A midfield with Matic, Fabregas, and a new box-to-box (again, I'd love to have Khedira) would be great. Hazard and Willian/Cuadrado/Salah?/etc. on the wings and Costa down the middle.

In terms of outbound players, I'd like to see Ramires and possibly Mikel gone to fund a new, more reliable, consistent, and technically skillful CM. There's also a lot of dead weight in our loan system that could do with cleaning up, so Marko Marin, Victor Moses, etc. should probably be sold. Every little bit will help add to the transfer budget and allow more room for salaries as well.


My ideal lineup then, going off what I said, would be:

Courtois

Dave Hummels Terry Luis

Fabregas Matic Khedira

Willian Costa Hazard

- We didn't accept Fabregas because it would have made stunting Wilshere/Ramsey's development OR putting Ozil on the bench. Considering Arsene has developed Wilshere/Ramsey immensely and spent a record fee on Ozil, that wasn't going to happen. Furthermore, that money was spent on Sanchez instead, who has turned out to be one of the most impactful signings in the EPL this year and exactly what we needed.

Can you explain with numbers how you as a British person haven't taken more from the NHS than me? You were born on it, big expense. Presumably you've had vaccines on it, big expense. I hope you've not had cause to visit hospital but many children do, big expense. I've used it once in 5 years. You are a way bigger drain on it than me. Our children will be equal drains.

Your parent contribution logic is faulty. Someone entering the system with no free use of the system is automatically in a better position. They are paying for themselves immediately, not the debt they owe generationally due to your concept. You just haven't thought it through. An average British person uses the system for free until they are 15 and again after they are 65. An immigrant without right to remain never uses it for free. An immigrant who does have right to remain uses it for free only after 65. How can you not understand that is less of a burden than you are? 

An immigrant arriving in the UK helps the UK economy grow, this helps the NHS, and the NHS has not had to pay to raise them.

As for your response to my comments about Ireland, I don't care about your opinion on the policy, I'm explaining the effect it had. They invested in me and I left, Britain gained. Please explain to me with a numerical example how this has not worked out better for Britain? 

EDIT: For example on this one, please explain your logic.

&gt;Your point is irrelevant, the NHS didn't gain.

It did gain. The Irish health service used its money to finance my childhood, to get me to healthy working age to pay back in. I left and came to Britain, now the NHS has a healthy working age individual paying in, who they have never had to spend a penny on.

You can't dismiss that as irrelevant because it is inconvenient. The NHS invested a lot in you to get you paying NI back in one day, it invested nothing in me at all to get the same NI. I cannot understand any possible way this does not work out better for the NHS, if you can give me some numbers I will accept it, but your words are unconvincing.",null,0,null,1428390246,null,0,1428391696,0,cq3w4ye,null,t3_31msqt,null,t1_cq3w4ye,null,t1_cq3ou58,null,null,null,1432242269,null,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8,null

Oh yeah. Probably. Still it's relatively easy for that to be spun as Labour arrogantly pushing though an English centric budget (although that too is something they could well do). 

&gt; But anyway I agree with you that Labour should offer the things you say; make the SNP an offer they cannot refuse. But I doubt Ed could drag his party to do that, I think the Blairites would sooner be out of power for 5 years than acquiesce to electoral reform.

I think the prospect of power might leave force their hand. I don't think Blairites would object too much to it either. They probably stand to gain in the long run as a lot of the country is where they're at - moderate. Even the SNP are, really, quite Blairite in many respect. They follow the more traditionalist capitalist model combined with increased spending on public services which is really what New Labour/Blarites boil down too. The socialist aspects of Old Labour would be muted with constant PR as extremes will be isolated. 

I think anyway. 

&gt; I'm hoping I'm proved wrong though, would love to see a proper reimagining of the British State for the 21st (even the 20th would be enough) century. Independence is only a means to an end if the British state proves itself as unreformable as I imagine it is.

Me too. This is my problem with the SNP. They're a nationalist party and I don't think they will ever act in a way that risks their long term objective. Stugeon joined as a nationalist. Their leadership is nationalist. 

They are not a party who have decided that Independence is a means to an end, it is the end-goal. The problems are framed in a way that helps that cause. They used to be more right-wing then moved to the left. There will never be a time where they decide the Union is the best way to solve a problem. There will never be an issue they won't look at within the context of Independence. If all the problems of food banks, poverty, and inequality were solved they will identify other problems to which they will argue that Independence is the way to solve it.",null,0,null,1428393926,null,0,false,0,cq3x12t,null,t3_31mql1,null,t1_cq3x12t,null,t1_cq3gdiq,null,null,null,1432242688,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Practical as it might be, legally obligating the public to vote, such as through compulsory voting in Australia, strikes me as illiberal.

But I do think more soft measures could be taken to encourage voting. Better education about polling day in schools. And I mean practical stuff, like walking them through a mock polling station. I was fortunate to have parents who explained how polling day worked to me and a dad who took me along to my first election. But I can imagine how uninterested or even intimidated I might be if was a first time voter and nobody was there to explain it to me.

So let's assume a Labour government is formed, propped up in some fashion by the SNP, regardless of what concessions (if any) Labour make to the SNP.

Here's a new conspiracy theory for you: What if the Tory party, from opposition, propose Home Rule in the form of a private members bill? There's nothing to prevent that, is there? The SNP could support that bill (or use the threat to force the Labour government to act similarly).

Having said that, it is famous for a reason, because its amazing, I did it in January a few years ago and it was as good as anything Europe has to offer. If you can put up with the midges there are lots of west coast routes which are amazing, the WHW is cool because the further north you get the more spectacular things get but also, other routes just start in mountains and end in mountains, and that's cool too!

When Fernando Torres had his first kid, for instance, Benitez didn't congratulate him, but had a go at him for something that he didn't do right in the match before. Benitez is someone who thinks that footballers should do their job, and if they fall out of form, they are frozen out. 

That being said, Benitez is someone that players will go to because he knows how to pitch. When Xabi Alonso was angling to leave Real Sociedad, he was linked to Real Madrid, and Manchester United (Sir Alex thought of him highly, if you read the papers at the time) but Benitez got him in the end. For Napoli, Higuain supposedly came to Napoli on Benitez (I hear?). In addition to that, as much the Napoli fans are cool on him, they do admit that Benitez has made their academy better and stronger.  Also, Benitez knows Europe, and is capable of getting good results there, as well as playing good enough football to stay in the top four.

null,false,thebirdandthebee,null,null,null,"&gt; I think most of our problems are entirely formation and in game tactics. Rodgers has seriously screwed the pooch for the last ~5 games, cracks began showing against Burnley, we were rubbish against Blackburn, Swansea was a fluke and United was a very fair result. Arsenal was a result of Rodgers continuing to stubbornly stick with a system that hadn't worked for 4 previous games.

Yes. Our players are relatively young, they're going to make mistakes, they don't have a bank of experience in terms of getting themselves out of trouble, etc., that's where the coach comes in. Once we started getting sussed (as in, Blackburn) that's where Rodgers should have started changing tactics.

It will be another 'transitional' year (which seems to have been the case since Jol left (is it really a transition if it takes 10 years?). We'll probably be battling for fourth, but realistically be contesting 5th and 6th with one of Everton, Liverpool, Southampton (depending on who makes good signings) and probably one other outsider. I'd hazard a guess at Swansea being decent if they keep hold of their better players and sign an underrated decent striker (something they always seem to do well, see Michu, Bony and probably Gomis once he settles). 

Ultimately, we're investing a huge amount of our capital into building a new stadium and this will obviously have repercussions on the pitch. I mean, it affected Arsenal's transfers significantly, and they were obviously in a better position than us to begin with. I'll be content if we make a a signing or two who actually IMPROVES the starting line up. I love Poch's emphasis on youth, but it doesn't mask the fact our purchases so far have been underwhelming. I mean, if you look at some of our signings recently (not all Poch) they are pretty poor. Capoue, Stambouli, Chadli recently, Paulinho, Lamela (who does have potential), Soldado, Davies, Vlad, Fazio, Yedlin (though he has potential again) etc have all had little real impact on the first eleven. I know that most of them were cheap, and you need squad depth, but eventually you have to improve your starting line up. Every cheap £6m player adds up, and I'd argue that one vast upgrade is better than signing three players who only really play in the Europa League. 

Again, I love the fact he has allowed youth players to thrive, but ultimately, players like Harry Kane (who has salvaged our season) only comes along every so often.

This isn't true.  People want to become GPs because they like seeing and treating people, rather than because of a lack of ability.  There are fewer exams, but don't let that give you the misapprehension that GPs are in any way second rate.  

There was a majority of people in my year at medical school (2003 intake) intending to become GPs.  Today that percentage will be much lower because the role is no longer as attractive.  Today, the role of a GP is highly varied, but it unfortunately includes too much non-clinical work.  This, in combination with pay and condition erosion, increasing workload, increasingly demanding public, and the increasing attractiveness of other countries, is making it a much less desirable job.  Medical students go on their GP block and see burned-out GPs and say ""no thanks"".

Your freelance expenses would reduce your freelance profits and therefore the amount of tax you pay on them. If you stay in full time employment then PAYE will continue to eat all your personal allowance so all your freelance profits will be taxed.

So if you pull in £10,000 per year in freelance income all of that would be taxed at 20% (assuming you're staying below the 40% band) - so you'd pay £2000 tax and some NI.

Of course current events will always derail these exercises, ie. 1981 Defence Review and the Falklands War. The Strategic Defence and Security Reviews (SDSR) should be where we focus our attentions.

As /u/Tony49UK says Strategic Reviews are not exactly an exact science. The 2010 Review was written with a post-Iraq/Afghanistan world in mind. The underlying assumption was that the world would be a *relatively* benevolent place. Three key ""changes"" have happened since:

Firstly, the Arab Spring. Secondly, the Russian seizure of Crimea and the resultant conflict. Thirdly, China's aggressive pursuit of territorial claims (the ""9 dash map""). 

Furthermore, the 2010 Review was led by the Treasury. The new model 2020 force was an attempt to balance the books whilst maintaining a semblance of security. It was a cost-cutting exercise. This Strategic Trends document should hopefully feed into the 2015 Strategic Defence and Security Review. 

These Strategic Reviews often provide an insight into the Civil Service and how they work. Something we normal citizens very rarely get to see. Strategic Reviews are also meant to be an ""antidote"" to the short-termism that pervades throughout our politicians and Civil Service. As soon as the SDSR becomes a cost-cutting or Treasury driven project we lose its inherent value.

In our democracy we elect politicians to make decisions on our behalf and then vote them out or back in depending on how they've done and what they'll do next. Referendums are relatively rare and, technically, we already had one on the EU. Labour are clear that they will remain committed to the EU if they win in May, people can take that into account when they vote. 

It's bit of a cheap shot to say he is arguing against democracy by maintaining Labour's position on the EU. It's a position you could use for any Government action that is passed without a referendum if you really want to do so.

I'd agree this is more cultural than religious, and isn't very prominent in vanilla islam. Male genital mutilation is however a massive muslim problem, so there is that to answer for.

\2. Muslim Societies Don’t Advocate Equal Rights

Women, homosexuals, transsexuals, slaves, non-muslims, ex-muslims etc. don't stand a fucking chance under the doctrines of bog standard islam. Think about their oppression before you worry about religious rights to oppress them.

\3. Most Muslims are Arabs

No one thinks this. Most people would be correct in assuming that most Arabs are muslim. Of course there are many exceptions.

\4. “Most Muslims are Terrorists”

No right thinking person believes this. Muslims following islamic doctrines is enough reason to challenge islam, we don't have to wait for violence to call out bad ideas and delusions as extreme.

\5. Only The Quran Promotes Extremism

Course it does and plenty of other nonsense. That other religions are violent is no valid excuse of the quran's barbarism. That muslims believe it is the perfect word of god, does explain why it is still so revered and devoutly followed, in that it differs from other abrahamic religions, magnifying the usual interpretive chaos one associates with religion.

Muslims are people. Most of them didn't choose their religion but were saddled with it by circumstance. Racists and xenophobes using religion as an excuse to justify and act on their irrational hate and fear of certain peoples, does occur and is a cause for concern.

HIV prevalence in the UK is about 0.3%, so even if you take the highest estimate of £300m, HIV treatment pro rata should be around £1million a year.

Now HIV treatment is more expensive than most other treatments, so it'll cost more than that, but to suggest that it's over a hundred million is a bit much, when the _total_ health tourism spend might well be around that figure each year.

If anything, FFP probably catalysed the change a little quicker. The noticeable change in transfer model compared to the initial takeover years - buying younger, less complete talents as opposed to the ready-made experienced player that often lacks re-sale value - along with the whole loan farm system that's particularly frowned upon are important parts of a rejuvenated system that makes us more ""shrewd"" in the transfer market, and enables us to buy more with less.

Also, the other component which seems to be paying off is the dedication towards expanding revenue streams. Yokohama Rubber is huge money, and the huge Premier League TV deals do help dramatically in ensuring the club's self-sufficiency, especially when you remember that Stamford Bridge's comparative lack of size hiders potential match-day revenue.

I met a traveller on an antique train

Who said: ""Two vast and crustless lumps of bread

Stand on the Formica. Near them, on the plate,

Half sunk, a shattered pickled onion lies, most brown,

With wrinkled skin, and veneer of old vinegar,

Tell that its maker well those recipes ignored 

Which yet survive, lumped by these lifeless things,

The cheese that mocked them and the pie that fed:

And on the menu these words appear:

'My name is cheese &amp; pickle, king of sandwiches:

Look on my filling, ye Passenger, and despair!'

Nothing beside remains. Round the decay

Of that colossal butty, boundless and bare

The lone and level plates stretch far away.

'Compulsory voting' is a misnomer. It's compulsory attendance of a polling station, and in the grand scheme of things, it's a very small civic duty compared to say, paying taxes. Try not paying taxes and see what happens. :P

You don't have to vote for an established party. You can submit a blank or spoiled paper, and in Australia the AEC collects these papers and analyses them to have an idea what these people were trying to say.

By comparison, not voting is open to interpretation. You could quite feasibly say that a non-voter is doing so because they're so satisfied with the system that they feel no need to vote, rather than not having anybody to vote for or having fundamental issues with the electoral process. It makes political disengagement easier to hand-wave away.

In Australia, people occasionally kick up a stink about compulsory voting, but the reality is that informal and donkey voting and suchlike don't happen that much. And they go to great lengths in ensuring everybody is able to vote by a wide variety of means, no matter where in Australia they are. And Australia has some pretty remote communities!

But really, the established political parties might not necessarily see the benefit of compulsory voting so long as they continue winning elections, so I don't think much will happen in the UK.

ii) We should show our full support to apostates, reformers, critics and heretics, within or outside of Islam.  It's not enough to support moderates if critics are unable to speak out.  We have to guarantee the right of everyone to speak out against their religion of birth.

iii) We have to challenge the well-meaning taboos on the left in which any criticism of Islam or Islamism is seen as racist or the result of a western imperialist mindset.  The 'NothingToDoWithIslam' brigade aren't helping Muslims.

iv) We should become more serious about free-speech in general.  That includes letting both letting extremists speak and letting people like Katie Hopkins express 'offensive' opinions, which may not be to our taste.

Buying you can easily burn through a couple of thousand or more on legal fees, mortgage fees, and other things.  When you sell there will be estate agents fees and more legal fees.  

If house prices spike in your area you could come out ahead, but if they stagnate or dip you could easily end up out of pocket.

It sounds like you're not at a point in your life where you're ready to make a mid to long term decision on where you want to live or what type of property you want to live in, at which point buying may not be the right move for you.

The one counter to that is if you fancy moving into landlording.  You *could* buy a place now to live in with the option of renting it out when it no longer meets your needs.  But that again is not a decision to take lightly; being a landlord is a business as well as an investment and it isn't suitable for everyone.

This is literally what is happening in this thread. People shouting simplistic abuse about issues and then if, shock horror, someone happens to defend the austerity argument, they are accused of being ignorant.

The level of debate on reddit is absolutely shocking. If you want Dogma just look through the comments on this thread:

Let's start with some hyperbole and pre-emptive accusations of ignorance:
&gt;You can tell Osborne has no economic background but is good at political manipulation. It pains me to think a lot of people think Conservatives are the right choice for the economy.

Maybe a cheeky strawman:
&gt;'But we created jobs!!!!!!'
The Tory/LD response to any criticism.

Or just some abuse:
&gt;Cameron is a total fucking cock.

Now let's try vague classifications and pseudo-conspiracy theories:
&gt;Big businesses and the wealthy would lose money. Guess who controls the mainstream media.

...and the same again:
&gt;Because it doesn't fit the neo-liberal consencus which has made a few people at the top including many politicians and their friends extremely wealthy and powerful.

...and then let's regurgitate an Owen Jones headline:
&gt;I would prefer well paid jobs not this zero hours / minimum wage crap they we have right now.


Regardless of where you stand politically, if you're seriously going to suggest ""This reddit group is actually quite good at putting forward alternate ideas and solutions"" then I think you should at least read the comments that ""this reddit group"" comes out with and supports.

Moreno: i really think hes a much better fullback than wingback. He doesnt have the football brain to know how to position himself properly at wing back, he's left gaping holes numerous times. At least at fullback he has a proper understanding of the position, yes he can switch off and make poor errors, but at least at fullback those errors won't be positional. 

Lallana: I actually think Lallana's at his best central. He's got the energy and work rate to do well there. Also he'll be a big upgrade on Allen creativity wise. Out wide games just past Lallana by.
Sterling and Sturride up top, surely that excites people, its got to at least put the opposition on notice and gives us a fear factor we sorely lack. If teams attack us they'll hopefully get blown away by our pace. If they sit back then thats also risky for them as we can score from distance and have good enough attacking fullbacks (Can, Moreno) that can stretch the pitch and break their back line (like City do in their pomp).

err no. If I, as non-Russian, sell Roubles for Euros, the Roubles don't go back to Russia! They go to the person who sold me the Euros. Same if a French bank in Paris sold pounds for Dollars. The only time your currency comes back is when the country, buys it back. Either by selling foreign currency reserves or by increasing interest rates so that people buy the currency so that it can be parked earning interest, in local banks/currency's central bank.

What happens is your exports become cheaper and your imports become more expensive. Thus it has a negative effect on trade balance. 

Exporters can see a boost in the volume of goods sold but the value decreases, if they need to import raw materials to make the goods the raw material prices will have risen.

Reading your post leads me to believe that you would be more inclined to believe the police becaues well, they are the police. Rather than take the story at face value and think, maybe the police were overly agressive or perhaps they escalated the issue more than they could have done.

Personally I think it is a weak mind which leads a person to behave like that. When I've been verbally abused and shouted down over a prolongued period of time, I think that person is weak because if they had confidence in their authority and their ability to do the job they would be able to remain proffessional and would not escalate a situation unless it was absolutely necessary.

In my experience, plenty of coppers fall under that category. About 50/50 as I say. The other 50% I have nothing but praise for.

This view, while bonkers-sounding, and others like it are astonishingly prevalent in such discussions and muddy the waters when someone is expressing an honest view. 

One of the other issues is that it won't change by constantly hammering it. And that constant hammering is likely to entrench the views of its adherents, and create more of a 'circle the wagons we're all in this together' mentality, which is counterproductive to the faith's liberalisation.

Islam gives men in particular a lot of power. Women are subjugated and secondary, and to be in under the command of men. ""Infidels"" are disposable. Islam puts the male adherent firmly at the top of the pile, there's not a lot of ""being meek""/humble.

So it essentially empowers young men to feel important, powerful, in charge, righteous, vindicated. It channels the violent instincts in a lot of young men in whom testosterone is surging, which traditionally was probably channelled into sport or warfare.

When it comes to women, it's more about sexual shame/purity and indoctrination from birth about lower gender status yet higher moral worth compared to all non-muslims. Some of the parallels with the religiosity among Catholic women, who vote against their own interests, can be seen.

Many on the left wail and cry about the ""right"" to cover, but they really don't see the damage it actually does to teenage girls. How divisive it is. How it creates a piety oneupmanship among young muslim girls.

I honestly think the only hope we have is banning *all* faith schools and mandating secularism across the board. Even private schools should be required to teach religion as a secular subject and cover atheism and different philosophies as a part of their syllabus. Head covering should also be banned in all primary and secondary schools - this applies to Sikh males as well.

The death penalty, trade deals, and security arrangements are not constitutional issues, and therefore it would be unusual to hold a referendum on them.

null,false,MJRocky,null,null,null,"I'll start with probably the biggest singular factor: Fernando Torres. Torres had such a profound impact on the club both on and off the field. And Chelsea's new approach when it comes to buying players indicates a resolve to not make a mistake like that again. The club seems to be carefully picking the best players to bring in and have been successful doing it (as opposed to reportedly rushing the move for Torres and not doing a medical). Chelsea have also avoided huge financial deals on one particular player (Mourinho said that they were offered Di Maria but declined). 

Roman and Chelsea realised early on that FFP would not effect them negatively much at all and openly endorsed it from the jump. This was surprising to many 'theorists' that believed Chelsea to be the main reason these regulations were coming into effect in the first place. Diligent work has been done to make sure the club is healthy financially, and can compete with the other big clubs. Christian Purslow was brought in to negotiate commercial deals and no doubt had a big hand in securing the second largest sponsorship in England^1. 

Another big strategy has been the buying of young prospects and usage of the loan system. To use a crude analogy, each young player is like a lottery ticket. You hope that you hit the jackpot and they become a great player that slots right into your first team. Sometimes they don't and won't, but these players are still good in their own right. Then they can be sold for much more than they were acquired for. Not to mention the fact that they're basically covering the cost of their initial sale through loan fees and having clubs cover their wages in some cases. Chelsea's ""loan army"" has been criticised, but one can't deny it's been an intelligent twist on using the transfer/loan market as another avenue to help the club.

Now that brings me to two factors I believe are very closely linked: The academy and manager stability. I'll start with the latter. With the return of Mourinho and his subsequent comments, Chelsea fans are salivating at the prospects of him staying a long time this go around. Dreams of a dynasty like we saw with SAF is the hope that many wish to see come to fruition. With a manager the board likes and trusts, we see that he has much more control with transfers and assessing targets than the managers of the recent past. Mourinho has worked closely with our wonderful technical director [Michael Emenalo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Emenalo) (who's background is very interesting you should look him up) and the pair are trusted to have a lot of control in the clubs transfers. Initially there was some question from Chelsea fans about how the two would work together but it's been seamless from all accounts. Speaking of other important people behind the scenes, the impact of Marina Granovskaia has been very important. Dubbed by some as the ""Most Powerful Woman in Football"", she has been influential in several player deals and as a liaison to Roman Abramovich. At some point last year she was also sent to oversee operations at Chelsea's partner club Vitesse. For all the crap Chelsea gets as an ""evil club"" having an ethnic minority and woman in prominent and powerful positions in the club is commendable.

Which brings me to the academy. There were significant financial and organisational efforts to improve the academy, and it started with the building of the [Cobham Training Centre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobham_Training_Centre) in 2007. The upgrade to world class facilities from the training ground used since the 70s was a big step forward in Mourinho's words. A lot of attention has been put into the academy, both in the prospects being recruited and the coaches teaching them. Many people associated with the club have returned to advise young players. Former first team players like Tore Andre Flo, and former academy players have created a real united club mentality. Many former academy managers or assitants have gone on to become first team managers elsewhere (Brendan Rodgers, Steve Clarke, etc.). The amount of great young talent in Chelsea's academy is starting to bloom and people are taking notice. The manager has even gone on record saying he would be at fault if a select few don't become full internationals. 

You bring up Manchester City and them being the new rich kids, and this brings me to an interesting difference in perception between the two clubs. For all intents and purposes, Chelsea have become a very well-run club. And while there is some grudging respect given, the public perception is still mostly negative regarding the club. City however seem to be impervious to criticism about how they're run, despite them doing a lot of the things that people want to vilify Chelsea for (insider deals, financial doping, openly flouting FFP). I haven't kept up with updates, but not long after Chelsea announced their new shirt sponsor deal with Yokohama, City announced a new deal with Etihad worth £30M more than the previous highest (Man U's)^1. I'd be interested to see if this gets reprimanded for being well over market value.

But probably most importantly, Chelsea have also adopted the extremely prudent philosophy of buying every player that scores against them. Charlie Adam should be next to come in under that policy surely. ;)",null,0,null,1428406586,null,0,1428410960,0,cq3zumf,null,t3_31qepy,null,t1_cq3zumf,null,t3_31qepy,null,null,null,1432244017,null,43,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,43,null

I do not think they have handled it as well as they ought, the obsession with the deficit (which is lower than the 50 year average) was damaging when the private demand was depressed. The IMF has come out and said that austere cuts were not necessarily the best course.

 I disagree that economists think the British economy is doing well, though my sources are only The Economist and The Financial Times, I do not spend my time reading academic papers on the economy. Britain has taken longer than any other comparable economy to recover from the recessions; unemployment is down but productivity is still less than the pre-crisis high which suggests that unemployment is down only due to cheap labour and underemployment. Surveys asking people if they wanted to work more hours have showed record numbers saying yes,  a sign that too many people are in part-time who don't want to be in part-time. I would argue that the correct economy only appears strong to the apparent weakness in Europe and the growth of low productivity (read low paying, underemployed) jobs.  

I would argue that the party most likely to jeopardise the economy at the moment would be the Tories due to their policy of a European referendum, something which would produce a huge amount of uncertainty and reduce private investment for the next 2 years. Labour's more left wing policies appear to be targeted at private wealth rather than corporate wealth, and should have minimal effect on the economy.

I agree that cuts were necessary but the timing was wrong, when interest rates on government gilts are so low and private investment so low, that is the time to borrow and invest not cut. Deficit reductions should occur during periods are growth not recession and stagnation. 

I say all this as a centrist who voted Lib Dem and will vote Lib Dem again. I feel that the current Tory economy boon is not their doing, I see no cause and effect between the governments policies and the current growth.

Missing that info, I took it to mean that the foreign sector decided to decrease its holding of pounds, which it *can only do* by pushing the UK into a current account surplus such that those pounds come back to UK shores.

&gt; What happens is your exports become cheaper and your imports become more expensive. Thus it has a negative effect on trade balance.

Generally, a lower exchange rate results in more exports, less imports, and therefore drives you more in to a current account surplus. ie ""better"".

Outside of the short term, once industry and consumers have adapted, you can expect an improvement in your terms of trade.

ECHR making British laws - not part of EU, would still be beholden to it. Laws coming down from Europe regarding regulation, part of the original trade deal. Addition of new countries?

Scotland, Wales and NI all have their own parliaments. We in England don't have our own parliament.  

The parliaments of Scotland, Wales and NI all have certain powers devolved to them. I believe they all differ a bit but generally healthcare, education, etc are all devolved. UK parliament has no control over those issues in Scotland, NI and Wales. 

This means that English voters (well, MP's) can't vote on those issues even if they want to. No English MP has any power over what Wales is doing with their health service, for example. Or rather, no direct control. Funding can still be altered via the Barnett formula. But that's another issue entirely. 

So you have a situation where Scottish, Welsh and NI MP's can vote on how education is handled in England knowing that it won't have any impact on their countries Education. 

So, the direct parallel for the SNP gaining seats in Westminster would be an English National Party gaining seats in Holyrood. And you bet the Scottish would bitch about English nationalists having a say in Scottish education, NHS, etc. 

Ideally England would get their own parliament.

This season we haven't worked as a unit, we've relied too much on individual brilliance, especially from Aguero. You only need to look within the same league to see how it's supposed to be done, Chelsea in the first half of the season and Arsenal in the second half are great examples of teams where everyone is part of every victory. Yes, they have their stars too, but they didn't/don't depend on them in the same way, in fact that's kind of what's gone wrong with Chelsea too, Fabregas and Costa most notably have switched off and now it's the Eden Hazard show, just barely scrapping them past teams like Stoke and Hull. The reason that we're completely down the shitter atm is that everyone we depended on have hit a bad patch of form now, Aguero hasn't scored for quite a lot of games by now and Yaya has gone back to his shit form from the start of the season, meanwhile Silva is being inconsistent as of late. I don't know how many people watched it, but Barca's away match against Celta Vigo this weekend is a great example of how things *should* work, none of their front three played well at all, and as a result everyone else stepped up to clutch a win with Mathieu being the unlikely hero once again.

&gt;Vast majority of MPs are on record saying they would vote to stay, and I expect them to know more than me and my neighbours, no offence to us.

...which is partly what's given UKIP their chance, because people are left feeling like they're not being listened to. Plus, we've been through a very tough time because Labour *didn't* make the right choices and the Tories *would pretty much have done the same*, despite having all the info.

&gt;If it turns out that the British people really care, they will vote in Tories/UKIP and Labour will have to change.

But there's the rub - UKIP want us out, whereas the Tories are really testing the EU to see if we can renegotiate things like immigration but they ultimately *don't* want us out. If they win, then there will be a lot of information available on the pros and cons (and some fantastic exchanges in /r/UK, no doubt). The sort of people that would vote 'exit' regardless are the people that would blindly vote Britain First, and I'd rather have a bigger player offering this option instead of having to deal with the *other* crap that a party like UKIP would bring with them simply because they were the only option. Not that I'd vote for them - Farage reminds me of Martin Sheen's character in The Dead Zone.

I can see you're not going to answer my questions though. Is there a post here, upvoted or downvoted, which genuinely informs the debate? Which provides an ""alternative solution"" as you said in your opening post? I'm simply asking you to support your initial comment. I can't find any comments that wouldn't be part of any mainstream discussion.

There is simply nothing positive about threads like this. They do not provide a level of analysis above the lowest common denominator peddled by the media. Fortunately, the media also has a huge number of qualified people providing commentary, so it's not all bad. Unfortunately reddit cannot say the same. I have given you my perspective on where you could find better analysis of this issue, and austerity in general. If you choose to ignore that then fine, but don't act like I'm telling you to ""be spoon fed"" just because I suggested there are people out there more qualified than randomers on reddit to talk about the economy.

All of the redevelopments and new builds are being aimed at them at the expense of social housing. The gentrification of local businesses is being aimed at them too. None of which is being questioned or complained about. Both of the main political parties tend to focus on that same middle class, especially in London - if they made an issue of the lack of social housing and the economic cleansing of London then it would make a massive difference. But instead it's being left to working class activist groups and protests like this, neither of which have any real mainstream political capital. They may not intend to do harm but if they're the main benefactors of something that's having a huge negative effect on other people without caring then it's going to create an oppositional situation.

Plus there is a definite sense of intent behind it in some places. Across South London places are getting 'village' stuck on the end of their name by estate agents and the new residents are complaining about the areas they're moving to.

Ignoring the fact that for a lot of people in the area Iceland is affordable and Waitrose isn't. Not that I'm defending £1 pizzas but like I say, it's a tiny example.

I have statistics which prove them wrong. It's horrible that in modern politics you can't call someone wrong, when they are wrong. Why can't I polarise the issue?

&gt;...which is partly what's given UKIP their chance

What chance though? If not enough people feel like that, the referendum won't happen, that's democracy. UKIP are going to have 2 or 3 MPs, why should that tiny proportion dictate policy for the whole country? That's madness.

&gt;because people are left feeling like they're not being listened to

They aren't, but mainly because they aren't listening either. They are wrong. We give them the stats which prove they are wrong, but they continue to buy the Sun, buy the Mail, buy the Express and lap it up. I can't really blame them, the narrative in those papers is believable, and easy to grasp. More people = less jobs &amp; more stress on NHS etc, makes sense doesn't it?

&gt;the Tories are really testing the EU to see if we can renegotiate things like immigration but they ultimately don't want us out

That's only just true, a large number of Tories do want to leave. Very few Labour do, that is how the majority of HoC does not want to leave, but Tories have always had a core which resented the EU, them being silenced by the party rather than torn apart for being wrong has lead to UKIP.

They are asking to renegotiate things which will never be changed - and they know this, so why do they do it? Free movement of workers in the EU is non-negotiable, they know this.

null,false,pavleg,null,null,null,"This may be unpopular opinion, but I don't like the kind of manager that Pellegrini is. I have read his big recent interview, and I just can't agree with things he say.

I can't understand the whole thing about being composed and calm all the time. I want manager of my team to be vocal, to help players when they are struggling. I want him to be emotional when needed, to scream and to motivate players if that's what it takes. He needs to be an undisputed leader and be respected and even feared.

Pellegrini has been great previous season, but when the time came, he failed to adapt. He is too stubborn, he just can't change the lineup, formation, tactic, etc. Players look lost and demotivated, and I don't see any changes coming, though it's been a while.

I often feel we start playing without a plan, thinking that ""we're better than them"". Constant back 4 rotation, 4-4-2 with Yaya in midfield without a proper cover, late sub's, I think almost everyone just screams about it, yet there are no changes coming and he persists with something that isn't working over and over again.

If he won't fresh things up, then we could even miss top 4 stop, and after that Pellegrini will be sacked for sure. But if he is ready to make changes, if he has owners trust, then he should recieve all the support he can.

As I said, I don't like and I don't understand his style. But if he proves that he can lead our team forward, if he'll show signs of improvement before the end of the season, he deserves his chance for sure.

&gt;I am aghast at some of the arguments used as to why having such a vote is ‘a great idea for democracy’. Apparently we should have a referendum because its 40 years since we last had a vote. That is seriously an argument for doing something of this magnitude and risk? A sort of ‘keeping us on our toes’ thing? So should we do the same for NATO? Or have periodic referendums not just in Scotland but all over the UK just to check popular feeling? We should have a referendum if we seriously believe that getting out of Europe is a national priority if our terms aren't met. If we don't, then it is a completely unacceptable gamble with our future.

...

&gt;The anti-Europe faction in British politics argues that Britain can ‘take back’ its freedom by leaving the EU. But the whole point of an alliance is that you enlarge your freedom to influence and to shape events through the instrument of partnership. Today, with globalisation ever blurring national boundaries and forcing integration on the world, such alliances are becoming the norm for every region of the world. Europe as an idea may have been born out of the wreckage of war; but today its rationale is not peace but power and it grows ever stronger.

... 


&gt;I know that those who want us out of Europe say that they agree with all that but we can do just as well, if not better, out not in.

&gt;In theory part of that may be true. But reflect on the forces leading this campaign to get us out: UKIP, and the right of the Tory Party. Ask yourself this question: do they represent that spirit? Are they the standard bearers of an open-minded culturally tolerant Britain? Are creativity, innovation and curiosity about what we can learn from the world their hallmarks?

&gt;We know what this movement to wrench us out of Europe is based on. You can see it on display when Mr Farage swiftly moves the debate to immigrants.

null,false,Froolow,null,null,null,"According to some data I just pulled on the 2010 election, there are only four seats in the UK which are so safe that if every non-voter voted for the party which came second, the party which won in 2010 would still win in 2015. Those constituencies are Sevenoaks, Somerset North, South Holland &amp; The Deepings and Witney. Interestingly these are all Conservative seats, although I don't think there's any great conspiracy here; Tory voters tend to be richer and older, and richer and older people tend to vote more, which means there are fewer voters who didn't vote that could swing the result.

On average, it would take a 23% of the non-voting population to swing a seat, assuming they all voted for the second-place party. This is obviously heavily skewed by 'knife-edge' seats like Hampstead &amp; Kilburn (Lab maj of 42) and Warwickshire North (Con maj of 54). These seats need less than 0.1% of the non-voting population to vote to swing the seat, compared to Rayleigh &amp; Wickford (Con) or Kirkcaldy &amp; Cowdenbeath (Lab) where 72% and 67% of the non-voting population are needed to get a swing. To try and correct for this, we can look at only seats where the majority is less than average (10.8% of non-voters would swing it) or greater than average (39% of non-voters would swing it). Incidentally Fermanagh &amp; South Tyrone was apparently perfectly tied last election, which I think is a rounding error in my dataset because Wikipedia says Sinn Fein won by three votes.

Finally I looked at a metric I called 'Effective Margin'. This assumes that everyone who didn't vote were proportionally distributed across the remaining parties, so that for example in an area with 50,000 voters, 40,000 of whom actually voted (split 20,000 Lab, 10,000 Con, 5000 LD and 5000 'Other'), I would distribute the 10,000 non-voters according to the proportion of votes that weren't for Labour - so 5000 Con, 2500 LD, 2500 'Other'. I then looked at what increase in turnout was required to overcome this new 'effective margin'. So this assumes that everyone who favours the 'safe' party in a safe seat goes out to vote - maybe they like sticking the boot in or something - while everyone who stays at home behave exactly like the population that votes for the other parties.

The results are a bit depressing. Of the 650 constituencies I got data for, 254 are completely safe - even at 100% turnout - assuming people vote their heart rather than tactically. 89 more require turnout from non-voters even higher than that of voters. Of the remainder, only one (Isle of Wight, Con) has a majority of greater than 10,000 votes and only one other has a majority greater than average - suggesting these are not safe seats.

So it seems, unless you live in the Isle of Wight or are prepared to vote tactically, the effect of getting all of those voters out would not be very great, unfortunately.",null,0,null,1428410030,null,0,false,0,cq410ge,null,t3_31qcrn,null,t1_cq410ge,null,t1_cq3zgh4,null,null,null,1432244636,null,19,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,19,null

Prove them wrong about what? Also, I could present statistics that show every single general election outcome was bad for the country (it's done by both sides every time) - so can we do away with those too?

&gt;Why can't I polarise the issue?

Because of a combination of the above and your apparent assertion that there's a single reason for people being upset about immigration.

&gt;UKIP are going to have 2 or 3 MPs, why should that tiny proportion dictate policy for the whole country?

Because people voting for them prevents one of the bigger players from winning, which makes a huge difference to the outcome.

&gt;They aren't, but mainly because they aren't listening either.

You know they're not listening even before sides have been presented in a referendum?

&gt;They are wrong. 

Why are they wrong? And what are they wrong about?

&gt;We give them the stats which prove they are wrong, but they continue to buy the Sun, buy the Mail, buy the Express and lap it up. I can't really blame them, the narrative in those papers is believable, and easy to grasp. More people = less jobs &amp; more stress on NHS etc, makes sense doesn't it?

Wow, that tar brush just got a lot bigger.

&gt;but Tories have always had a core which resented the EU, them being silenced by the party rather than torn apart for being wrong has lead to UKIP.

And are these Tories' reasons for wanting to leave all the same as the Express/ Sun readers?

&gt;They are asking to renegotiate things which will never be changed

You have absolutely no way of knowing this.

&gt; Free movement of workers in the EU is non-negotiable, they know this.

As things stand. Hence a referendum. Several past PM's have negotiated things for us out of the EU/ EEC that have come to pass despite people 'knowing' it couldn't happen.

I think that midfield setup would fix a lot of the defensive frailty of last season's diamond as well, because there are 3 players in it that defend very well as opposed to 1 (the Gerrard/Hendo/Coutinho midfield wasn't exactly a defensively solid setup...).  Our passing game changes a little bit without Gerrard, it becomes shorter and a bit more rapid, but we saw that we can play very well that way last season with the Lucas/Hendo/Allen midfield when Gerrard was injured.

I really think a huge part of our defensive woes in the 4 man back line last season and this season came from having such a defensively suspect midfield.  If you play Gerrard as a midfielder then you basically play with 1 less defensive player at all times, so it feels like the switch to 3 at the back just added the extra man back in.  4 at the back with a proper defensive midfielder and 2 strong, enthusiastic runners like Can and Hendo should still have  alot of stability.",null,0,null,1428411250,null,0,false,0,cq41ini,null,t3_31q03s,null,t1_cq41ini,null,t1_cq3wn6n,null,null,null,1432244874,null,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6,null

Oh really? Do you see the legions of people upvoting me and agreeing with me?....No? Me neither. Pointing out hypocrisy with evidence is not a circle jerk. I'm simply asking you to back up your point with evidence. You made a comment which was not grounded in the reality of reddit and was based purely on your political leanings - I am simply pointing out why I disagree with that comment and providing evidence for it using the comments in this thread. 

You can't go around praising the political discourse on this subreddit and then act surprised when someone calls you out on it. You need to provide some evidence and that's all I've asked for. Either in the form of comments which provide an alternate solution, or comments which are not already part of mainstream political commentary and thus could be found in the media.

&gt; even if I provided you with an answer you would ignore it because of your belief that everything in this place is bull shit.

Not true at all. I'm just asking you to show me something that backs up your original point. You said:

&gt;This reddit group is actually quite good at putting forward alternate ideas and solutions

I'd like you to prove that. I can't find anything in this thread that shows an ""alternate"" idea or solution. I especially can't find anything better than what is in the media. Also, I asked you for your perspective, not mine. I want to know what comments **you** think are praiseworthy. I don't care if I disagree with them, I just want to know what measure you are using when you talk about alternate solutions and criticise the media for brainwashing. Agreeing with the political ideology is irrelevant, as I have said several times. I just don’t see anything in this thread that is particularly useful (relative to what you hate - the media) or provides an alternate solution. 

I guess you don't want to provide evidence because then I could explain any potential pitfalls and you'd rather not hear about them. Sticking your head in the sand just because reddit happens to agree with you is not a good idea. Just like I have explained how it's important to avoid certain parts of the media, I think you should be willing to accept that threads like this are not exactly a high level of political discourse.

&gt;following a devaluation or depreciation under a certain set of assumptions

&gt;After some time, though, the volume of exports may start to rise 

&gt;domestic consumers may buy fewer of the costlier imports

&gt;Immediately following the depreciation or devaluation of the currency, the volume of imports and exports may remain largely unchanged due in part to pre-existing trade contracts that have to be honoured. Moreover, in the short run, demand for the more expensive imports (and demand for exports, which are cheaper to foreign buyers using foreign currencies) remain price inelastic. This is due to time lags in the consumer's search for acceptable, cheaper alternatives (which might not exist).

&gt;Over the longer term a depreciation in the exchange rate can have the desired effect of improving the current account balance. Domestic consumers might switch their expenditure to domestic products and away from expensive imported goods and services, assuming equivalent domestic alternatives exist. Equally, many foreign consumers may switch to purchasing the products being exported into their country, which are now cheaper in the foreign currency, instead of their own domestically produced goods and services.

You'll notice there are a lot of qualifications in the statements, the *might, could, if exists*. The problem the UK and a lot of countries have is that manufacturing has been outsourced to cheaper producers e.g. China. Consequently there isn't the domestic production available to switch to.

Depending where you live, 15k may not be enough for a deposit (and you get noticeably better mortgage rates if you go past 10, 20% etc), so consider building that up and to rent a place out you may need a different mortgage or an agreement from your provider to do it - best not to assume it's so simple. I've seen providers want a 40% deposit for a buy to let mortage - which wouldnt be your situation I know - however, they may want a similar amount of paid off equity in the property to allow you remortage it to a buy to let so you can rent it out without living there.

null,false,duney,null,null,null,"I think the formation situation boils down to Brendan knowing which one to use depending on who we play. Over the last 3 seasons we've seen 3 formations that have given us runs of success - 4-3-3 in the first season, 4-4-2 diamond last season, and 3-4-2-1 this season.  

The 4-3-3 was particularly successful back when Suarez was banned in BR's 1st season but fizzled out towards the middle of the 2nd season when we were struggling to break teams down.  
  
The 4-4-2 diamond worked when Suarez/Sturridge/Sterling were on point, with Coutinho/Gerrard/Allen behind them, but caused a leaky defence problem, which wasn't the be-all and end-all last season, but was emphatically exposed this season with no top strikers available.  

The 3-4-2-1 has been great at fixing our leaky defence while being able to control the middle of the pitch, but let's be honest; a majority of the games we played in this formation were against so-called weaker opposition - Spurs game us a game, we needed wonder goals to beat Man City and Swansea/Man U/Arsenal pressed hard early, effectively forcing us into a 9-1-0 formation for large parts.  
  
BR's been good at changing formations long term based on the players he has available, but going forward, I'd like to think he is now at a point where he can choose the aforementioned formations not only on his available players, but also based on who we're playing. I'm no football coach, or a tactical wizard, but for example, 3-4-2-1 could most useful against weaker teams/teams that park the bus; 4-4-2 diamond against teams without pace that are unlikely to catch you on the break; 4-3-3 (or 4-2-3-1 holding midfielders) against teams that are likely to press. This all of course, would depend on players available, but I think that BR is capable of working this out, and will continue to improve on this aspect of management as time goes on.  
  
**TL;DR** BR has a few successful formations at his disposal; we should be looking at using each one depending on the kind of team we're up against *and* the players we have, rather than sticking with a formation until we get found out.",null,0,null,1428413367,null,0,false,0,cq42hq0,null,t3_31q03s,null,t1_cq42hq0,null,t3_31q03s,null,null,null,1432245334,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

There is absolutely no way they would have restrained him without him attempting to walk off and being a dick about it when asked to come back. And I'm fairly certain that's what happened. He thought being so close to home he could simply leave, regardless of why the police stopped him.

&gt; Why should I comply when I've done nothing wrong? Just because they wear uniforms, doesn't give them the right to do what they like.

Actually, it does. We give the police a lot of powers, and they have the power to detain people for questioning if they have reasonable suspicion you may have committed a crime.

And it's not about preserving 'ghettos', it's about providing affordable housing for working class people and the low waged. As it is those people have no where to relocate *to*. It's not just a matter of moving to a different borough, or 'integrating', it's being forced out of your home, away from your community, your family, your job, your friends and the city you're from.

On here people seem to widely acknowledge the great run we went on, but that in the past 3-4 games we've looked rather poor in a similar way to how we looked in the first half of the season.  There's a bit of frustration about not moving a little quicker to change things after a couple of matches where we were clearly not quite right again, but that's not really an unfounded frustration after the horrors of the first half of the season.

So here's the deal: We had a nice 3 months of good form and that should overshadow our overall pretty poor season?  That seems absurd.  The team bounced back incredibly well for a while there and gave the majority of us some serious hope of still reaching what were identified by the club as major objectives this season (win a trophy and top 4 finish).  We could yet win a trophy with the FA Cup, but the one I think we really identified as important was the top 4 finish.  I think it's fair for us to be a bit disappointed, especially with the talk coming out of the club about making sure we stay in the top 4 this season and it being a very important goal.

There will always be people who overreact and preach that doomsday is upon us, and those voices will typically be the loudest (it's way easier to be vocal about something bothersome than something you're content with).  The attitude right now, while a bit negative, is still much better than it was in December when there was a ton of clamour to remove Rodgers, replace everyone related to transfers, and screaming that the entire team sucked.

I think we mostly get that it was a long shot, but the team gave us some belief with the run they went on.  To have hope and see it really become a tangible goal, then to have it all come crashing down against our bitter rivals is a serious emotional rollercoaster.  It seems more absurd to expect people to not be at least a little bit upset.

This game is fueled by passion.  It's an intensely emotional experience, especially when it matters a lot to a person, and that doesn't just apply to actually playing the game.  When someone cares about something a lot and it goes wrong, they're going to be upset.

&gt;Let's make things simple and assume I am going to pay you £1000 for a job and your marginal tax rate is 25%. The job requires a stay overnight nearby and you can stay at either a budget hotel costing £50 (Scenario A) or a more luxury 5-star experience costing £250 (Scenario B).

&gt;* In Scenario A you make a profit of £950.00 and pay £237.50 in tax and end up with £712.50 in your pocket after the job.
* In Scenario B you make a profit of £750.00 and pay £187.50 in tax and end up with £562.50 in your pocket after the job.

&gt;You only reduce the amount of tax you pay because you reduce your overall income. In fact you are reducing your income for a net loss of £150.  

&gt;&amp;nbsp;  

&gt;Bonus Edit: So why would anyone choose Scenario B? Upgrading in this instance is cheaper using pre-tax money than post-tax especially since a business can reclaim the VAT. For the £200 room upgrade it only ends up costing £150 (even less if you have a higher marginal tax rate). The same room upgrade for a consumer (who would also pay VAT) would be £240. There are also some other reasons why someone might choose the 5* hotel (e.g. appearance to clients, quality of sleep) but strictly financially it does cost more than the budget room.",null,0,null,1428416594,null,0,false,0,cq447c6,null,t3_31nqxg,null,t1_cq447c6,null,t1_cq3ggd1,null,null,null,1432246140,null,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1,null

Considering it covers shirt, stadium and campus it's well undervalued now compared to when it was penned (in 2010 I think). Could probably get £30m alone for the stadium now.

Without being an expert, what is clear is Soriano and Tom Glick (now moved to New York City FC) have done a great job on the commercial side. I'm not sure any club other than United has signed as many of these 'official partnerships' as MCFC have in the last couple of years. There are apparently more deals coming including a big one with Citibank being negotiated.

They are also selling rights to parts of the new academy/campus, such as this recent deal with Suissegas: https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7471/15726827249_9321e7a589_b.jpg

Soriano did a seminar last year and talked about revenues and it was an upward trajectory. I think he's hopeful of surpassing Bayern Munich soon. They just brought in a bunch of new expensive seats in the stadium to bump match day revenue plus new expansion seats plus yet more price rises on existing season tickets... so I guess match day revenue will now go up.

Only Sturridge ticks all the boxes and he's injured a lot.

If Liverpool go down the youthful route, there are lots of strikers out there who fit Rodgers' style.

Berardi
Origi
Alcacer
Volland
Ben Yedder
Lacazette (Slightly more expensive)

We could also give a shot to Jerome Sinclair.

As I've mentioned before, there are thousands of professional footballers out there who fit Rodgers' system a LOT better than Balotelli.

A specialist time at the gym just means it was in the gyms best interests (money wise).

That could be for many reasons:

1 or very few female complainees making allegations without merit and the management believe they will not lose a significant membership from the move. (a counter to this without discriminating would be to investigate every claim intensively to come with the truth but bar anyone found making false claims)

Another possibility is trying to attract an under represented group to the gym by pre evaluating what may be stopping some from going. (a better alternative would be to offer corporate discounts to more industries dominated by women [my local gym offers discounts to a lot of male dominated businesses as so ends up with a lot of male corporate users])

Another reason could be personal bias on the hands of the owners, either a man/woman who feels women need protecting but without the proper training to enact an effective policy or a man/woman who has some personal experience clouding thier experience and enacting the policy as a result.
(a good alternative would be to evaluate all policies for positive and negative discrimination against all groups, protecting one group is not justification for trampling the rights of another).

The next year he got them to finish fourth with great attacking football, really great to watch and effective. This year it looks like they'll be finishing third and they still play very attractive football. The man can coach a team.

He also has a reputation of developing young players. I'll link a source for it.

&gt;Favre is also well known for his ability to develop talented young players and introduce them into the first team. Under his leadership, Blerim Džemaili, Almen Abdi, Steve von Bergen and Gökhan Inler made their debut with the Swiss national team before signing for foreign clubs. In 2007, FC Zürich became Swiss champions with an average age of twenty-one years and a half. He is also credited with raising the game of German starlet Marco Reus whose fine performances procured a call up to the German national team and a high-priced move to league champions Borussia Dortmund.

And also

1) The facebook page you linked for the protest reblogged the Black Revs protest, so it's quite obvious that the two are intertwined and support one-another, so they are working together.

2) I hope it does go like that and that the protest is peaceful.

3) Yes, i do give a fuck about Gentrification when it is Gentrification. The reasons why this is sketchy as fuck is because 

A) It's fucking London. Pretty much the Capital of the financial world, the second most visited city in Europe, The tech Hub of Europe and political center of one of the worlds most powerful nations. Obviously it's going to receive a shit tonne of investment from the Government for these ""Hipster buildings"" and being redone and rebuilt, because it's London. The one thing I fucking hate about London is how much money you receive to my shitty little area in the North Of England Near Liverpool. No one could point us out on a fucking map. And then you actually get investment for new buildings to be built, new buildings, new commodities and Office buildings, whereas my hometown looks like Eastern Ukraine, with a meager investment from Boots, and then you have the audacity to complain about this? It's why people hate the city. I would happily take the investment Brixton is about to receive off of them and have it placed here in a heartbeat, If it was offered I would snatch it up. 

B) The other issue I have with this is that Black people where put at the front of the protest and everyone else was just allowed ""come if they please"" Like all of a sudden the black community matter more than the Asian and White communities in the area. Why not just ""Help stop this terrible thing, people of Brixton! Everyone come out, no matter creed or race"" Instead, no. It's just Black people need to come out at the front of this, and then there is snide comments like ""I haven't seen a black person a week!"" Like that should matter if you haven't seen one. I get being a multicultural society is good into my face, so everyone else should as well, even if that means white moving back in.

I think the point of this case (and others where they are seemingly breaking the law when not in an emergency situation), whether they had permission as they did in this case, or not, is that they are the ones up holding the law, and they should go out of their way to show they are adhering to it too and set the example.  Ad being parked on a bus stop may seem harmless, but it the bus can't pull in the hold up traffic, then it only takes one impatient person to try and over take it and you have a potential accident.

I saw a police car (not on an emergency call) do a U-Turn at a very busy set of lights on the A12 in Ilford a couple of weeks ago, where it isn't allowed because they are crossing into the path of pedestrians cross that road, only to pull into McDonald's.  It really fucking pissed me off because I cross that road a lot and often have to dodge out of the way of mini-cabs and the like doing U-Turns there when they shouldn't ... and then I see the police doing it.",null,0,null,1428418678,null,0,false,0,cq45fl3,null,t3_31qgly,null,t1_cq45fl3,null,t1_cq42cvs,null,null,null,1432246719,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

That the law anyway, the chances of anything coming of it, if it's reasonable (i.e. parking on a bus stop or double yellows in an emergency) is very slim. The circumstances would be taken into consideration and exceptions made etc

He's also made them a hard side to beat in Europe despite their stature in the modern game, beating the likes of City, Barca and United.

Lets look at City's 3 biggest signings in the summer, Fernando, Caballero and Mangala. I actually approve of the Mangala signing, he is a good + young centreback but so was Nastasic who was surprisingly let go very easily.

A(?): The North has a shitload of problems, you want to protest? I'll support you in whatever way I can, so will a lot of Londoners. That aside, this development isn't being done by the government, it's private and the vast majority of people in the areas it's happening in can't afford to live there after it's done. Which is why local councils are recommending people move up north to towns like yours, where they can add to your unemployment and housing problems. If you want that sort of development you're welcome, and when you've been priced out of the area you're from and forced to wherever they decide to send working class people to next you can go back and visit it. If you can afford to that is. And to be honest I don't give a fuck if you hate my city, don't come down here, simple as that.

In recommended watching order, then, 12 episodes (couldn't decide what to cut, sorry) which should serve as a good introduction:

1) Blink. Good place to start, as the Doctor isn't in it much; friendly way to get into it, and an excellent episode.

2) Rose. It's a decent episode, but more importantly, it's the first ep, specifically designed to re-introduce (or to many of us younglings, introduce) the show to audiences.

3&amp;4) Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead. They're an excellent version of a typical Who episode, to my mind; sinister, lots of adventure, epic in scale, fun, that kind of thing.

5) Dalek. Again, it was designed to be an introduction/re-introduction to the eponymous main enemy of the Doctor. Unlike ""Rose"", however, which was a good episode, this one is fantastic.

6) The Doctor's Wife. This is a wonderful episode and a neat little exploration of the Doctor's relationship with the little blue box.

7) The Waters of Mars. Very dark in tone, wonderfully written and made, it's extremely creepy, slightly terrifying, and demonstrates some wonderful moral murkiness.

8) Listen. A subversion of the form, it is essentially an examination of fear, and (in my opinion) the best thing that Moffat has ever written.

9) The God Complex. No specific reason, I just really, really like the episode.

10) Midnight. In what I maintain is the most terrifying thing ever broadcast, this is a complete subversion of the usual form of the show, is possibly the darkest episode (though Listen and The Waters of Mars gives it a run for its money), and sees all the Doctor's techniques and tactics backfire as human nature takes over.

11&amp;12) Human Nature/The Family of Blood. To conclude, a two-parter which examines the more emotional and human side of the Doctor.

Naughton is a good example.  He wasn't going to displace Walker, but he was a good backup.  Good enough to move to Swansea and be a regular starter.  So we sold him, and now we have a makeshift RB (chiriches) and a youth player (yedlin) as backup for Walker.  Do you think we could buy a player like Naughton and ask that he ditch his starting role and come play backup to Walker for the same weekly salary?  Chelsea can do that because they can pay their backups as much as we pay our starters.

But to say he's been our **best** player is an absolute slap in the face to guys like Coutinho, Henderson, Can &amp; Sakho who have held the team together and dragged us to victories/clean sheets. 

My point can be pretty much symbolized by a piece of play against Blackburn (I think it was Blackburn, might have been Chelsea actually) where Coutinho picked up the ball on the left wing, took on four or five players to outside the 18 yard box, plays it to Sterling who then misplaces a simple 5 yard pass. Those basic mistakes are costing us more than possession and they happen far too often for me to start touting Sterling as our messiah. He's got us some important goals and I'm grateful for that. I support Sterling completely and I think he'll be one of our best ever players if he stays, but he's **not** world class, he's **not** the be all and end all of this season or next season and he's **not** our best player.

null,false,kick_muncher,null,null,null,"Signing players is a lot harder than it may seem, I reckon. I thought Lovren would slot right in immediately. I really rated him as a defender, as did Neville and Carra (both far more expertly versed in that art of defending than I am). He was viewed as an experienced defender who could lead our defence. Obviously that hasn't happened. It may well do in future (I think he has improved quite a bit in recent games) but the point stands that signing players is difficult regardless of experience. No player (besides maybe Messi, Ronaldo and similar) are guaranteed to be effective or successful, regardless of their age. Every signing is a (calculated) risk with an untold number of crucial variables.

I don't think our best performers being our younger players is necessarily a bad thing. As you say, the supposedly experienced BPL players signed by Kenny were underwhelming to say the least, whereas players like Suso, Sterling and even Spearing stepped up. Similarly, last season Flanno outperformed the much more experienced Johnson. 

You may be right in that while those younger players might have more quality than the club's older players, they lack the experience and thus the consistency required for success. I think I'd agree, with the caveat that players like Henderson and Coutinho have really started to perform consistently and lead the team this season. They are young players but Rodgers has given them a lot of game time and responsibility. I would argue that they are consequently much more experienced for their age than most players. 

Striking the balance between youth, quality, experience and consistency is a problem every manager has to struggle with, not to mention their own experience. I think that we are actually doing pretty well to be in 5th with such a young squad (and manager!), given the relative resources of the clubs above us in the table.

I'm about to put my £15240 into LifeStretegy 80 on my iWeb account, however I'm a bit confused with fees and how it'll work with the ISA limit.

The details for the trade are:
Commission: £5.00
Initial Charge: 0%
Annual Management Charge: 0.24%

And I currently have £15240 sitting in the account as cash. Do I need to have an additional £5 &amp; 0.24% x £15240 = £41.58 in the account to pay for the charges, and buy £15240 shares or does this go over my ISA limit, and I actually need to buy £15198.52 shares + £5 + 0.24% x £15198.52=£15240?

I could be extremely wrong here however I know you can get a lot of comics from Waterstones and Blackwells not including Amazon/Online sites. What I'm getting at is realistically is there a large enough group in Oxford/Surrounding areas to warrant them coming to your store to get a comic rather then going to these alternative options?

If you do still go ahead with it then a few things to consider: (I'm sure you're aware of this already, apologies if I'm repeating others)

- You'll want to invest in a food/drink licence to sell a minimum of Coffee/Tea and minor snacks (cakes, sandwiches, nibbles etc); simply because your first year of business is going to be usually the toughest plus Oxford rates means if you fail to do well at the start it will usually end up flopping.  Coffee/Tea will help with building a comfortable environment for individuals to stay longer in your store and read, but also if nothing else it adds another stable revenue stream for the majority of people who just want a beverage to go (I know they haven't seen the light yet and got into comics, but majority of the community don't read them but still love tea/coffee.. solid backup to bring in the extra cash). 

- Think about reaching out to local stores similar to you for discount/partnerships, people like Thirsty meeples would be a good contact it's a good bet that individuals who go there may also have an interest in comics (being too greedy in the first year with monopolising business is always a downfall for new start ups)

- Offer a discount scheme to one of your biggest markets, Oxford University Students. If you walk around the city you'll see a few stores/places have specific college schemes to give discounted goods to students. It would be a wise investment to get in touch with colleges and for freshers week put a stand up and advertise your business(You'll be surprised how effective this type of advertising is within Oxford)

- Possibly doing similar themed events; realistically this is more for me and you will have my money if you do it. Game of Throne TV nights, broadcast each new episode at your store; sell some drinks (licence obviously involved) and offer comfy seats with themed TV shows and I'm sure you'll sell out each time. (Walking Dead, GoT, Marvel Agents of Shield... it'll bring in students guaranteed)

null,false,ibpants,1972crest,,null,"I must say it fucks me right off when I hear people comparing us with Chelsea as though we both got taken over at the exact same time.  They stole a march on us by *5 years* - that's a long time in football.  They are (as you'd expect them to be) pretty well entrenched in the upper echelons of domestic and even world football now.  We are (as you'd expect us to be) a little way behind, but we're getting there.

FFP put a tight timetable on our growth phase.  People point to the rate of our spending and call it disease, but I think it's better viewed as a symptom - the disease is whatever has made it necessary for a team to spend *so much* money to jump from midtable to Champions League regulars.  It's not a healthy situation and FFP only exacerbates the problem.

Anyway, I digress.  I think we are beyond phase one, which was by pure necessity rapid growth (specifically *on* the pitch).  Rapid growth required rapid spending and it remains to be seen for certain, but it looks very much like we've Indiana Jonesed it at the last second through the closing FFP door.  We got hit with sanctions but none of our sponsorships were adjusted.  From this summer the reigns should hopefully be off and we can spend as freely as the other big teams again.  

In my mind we're beyond the rapid growth phase and are starting the process of future-proofing, and are doing so in a number of ways.  

1) the huge investment in the academy means that we now have one of the very best facilities in the world.  It doesn't mean we can count on wave after wave of world class youngsters but it means we are more attractive to potentially world class youngsters and are well equipped to help them reach their potential.  

2) We're expanding the stadium.  Despite the jokes (and the reality of weekday evenings) we sell out the stadium regularly so there's demand for more tickets.  We'll see if there's demand for as many tickets as we're making available, but as I say, this is part of our future-proofing efforts.

3) we'll see what happens, but I expect to see something of another clear-out of the squad with a few new faces.  This is more general maintenance than future-proofing, but it kinda counts.  We are still working towards a lower wage bill, which certainly is future-proofing in my eyes.

4) as you'll have noticed, the City Football Group is now a thing, and that's part of the clubs strategy to develop *off* the pitch (and maybe a little bit on it).  I see a lot of people talk about the New York and Melbourne Citys as ways of ""dodging"" FFP but as part of the sanctions [there was an agreement reached with UEFA about how we'd report these](http://www.mcfc.com/News/Club-news/2014/May/Club-statement-16-May) so you can be sure that UEFA aren't going to let any funny business slide.  What no one seems to be talking about is how we now have strong commercial and scouting bases in some of the wealthiest countries in the world, particularly in countries where the sport has room to develop.  If this goes as planned it won't be a case of dodging FFP, it will be a case of driving right over the fucking thing in a monster truck.",null,0,null,1428421202,null,0,false,0,cq470ch,null,t3_31r0sb,null,t1_cq470ch,null,t3_31r0sb,null,null,null,1432247462,null,3,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,3,null

Everyone is on the hunt for consistent quality, and they're the players that are the hardest to buy, especially in our price range. I truly believe anyone can go out and spend £30 million on Costa and Sanchez--that's simple. Those players are good enough that they are nearly guaranteed to perform, but their price is prohibitive due to their reliability. 

Trying to sign players of that quality for £20 million and less is extremely difficult, and the risks are even greater, as the sums are still huge, but the players in that range are far less likely to succeed than the upper echelon. I really think this was the skill of Rafa--being able to pick a player for around £10 million who would do well.

I know there seems to be an assumption that fans that want him gone are just annoyed at this poor run of form, and yes, that is a factor, but it is more that it is not a one off occurrence, form is swings and roundabouts with him.

I feel he is inconsistent, that to an extent, he will favour players such as Nolan and Carroll regardless of their form just due to personal connections. On that same tone, I also feel that if someone falls out of his favour, such as Amalfitano recently, he will keep them out until they are back in his good books, which again I personally think shows a side of immaturity. 

Furthermore, his reluctance to look at the youth system again I find very disappointing. There is great potential in the system and we have seen the calibres of players it can produce, these players need experience and with Sam this will not happen. 

I think he is losing support left, right and centre. The board don't support him, I feel there may be some dressing room discontent that we are not aware of or that is quelled by notable figures such as Nolan and Noble. 

Everything can not be summarised to injuries and a poor run of form. Yes he has been good in the transfer market, but we cannot keep a manager just due to that. I say take a gamble, I think we have the players, facilities and the desire to succeed at a higher level. It is just a matter of time until the Olympic Stadium brings in new and bigger investment and personally, I would rather have a manager with a year under his belt first once we get there over a complete reshuffle in the first months.

A few Conclusions:

1. Looks like Ade's contract is up this summer (I'm thinking there's an option hence his reluctance to leave in Jan).

2. Lennon/Kaboul/Vertonghen will be in their final year in 2016. I expect all to stay and leave for a free next year (football equivalent of winning the EuroMillions).

3. Capoue/Paulinho/Soldado have good time left on their contracts. I expect Paulinho/Soldado to stay as I simply cannot see Levy taking the hit. I think Capoue will go because he was only £9m and we stand the greatest chance of recovering a fair amount of that. Also with 2 yrs left now is the time to deal.

4. Dembele/Townsend is a resign or sell job. With 2 years left the time is now.

You can't just pay Hazard £400k per week (because you signed him on a free) and think you can placate other club players and their agents by pointing to his amortized FFP cost as justification. The club will always try to negotiate a salary based on the market, not on total amortized annual cost. I wonder if Lewandowski is making way more than Goetze, Mueller, Ribery et al at Bayern just because he came for free. I doubt it is the case.  2) Everyone realizes that LFC is negotiating with Sterling now because they want to sign him before his contract ends. The article is written almost as though this is a mysteriously unknown factor, but it is of course the main thing driving this story right now. Everyone recognizes the potentially disastrous situation for a club if a superstar plays out his contract and leaves on a free. Similarly, we all realize that any player would rather take a massive jump in salary today rather than playing out his contract, assuming that risk, in the expectation he can make more later. It is common sense human nature to try to lock in a massive guaranteed deal now, even if there is an expected economic benefit in waiting two years. Isn't that the widely recognized dynamic driving these negotiations? The closer a player gets to the end of his contract, the more the team will have to pay to keep him, right? The longer away it is, the more breathing room the team has because the player is looking at two or more long years at his current wages.",null,0,null,1428421918,null,0,false,0,cq47h5g,null,t3_31r6uo,null,t1_cq47h5g,null,t3_31r6uo,null,null,null,1432247682,null,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3,null

This is a decent example of an instance in which tighter regulation on what is an acceptable level of well-integrity is necessary. There have been several cases of contaminated ground water in the US thanks to the mechanical failure of the well caused by poor materials selection in the well structure. Where steel tubing and cement where insufficient to withstand the pressures involved and there was leakage from the gas well.*

There is no evidence that any groundwater contamination is due to the actual process of hydraulic fracking, it is broadly accepted that the fissures created during fracking are not long enough to affect aquifers. If the trapped gas being released could escape into the groundwater, it would have already done so and there would be nothing to extract.

The problem is, that would destroy the wage structure and transfer market for other players. Say Hazard did not sign an extension and moves to Madrid on the quoted 400k per week. What if he doesn't work out and they consider offloading him? Who is going to buy an out of form player on 400k per week? What if he works out great and the other players want to be paid like him?

-Chelsea FC was founded on March 10, 1905. That makes the club 110 years old.

-Chelsea FC is named after the Chelsea borough in London, and  Stamford Bridge was named after the bridge of the same name.

-Stamford Bridge isn't in Chelsea, it technically is in the Fulham borough, hence it being located on Fulham Road.

-Chelsea is considered a London club and our biggest rivals are by far Arsenal. Other nearby notable teams include Queens Park Rangers (QPR), Tottenham Hotspur (Spurs), West Ham, Reading FC, Fulham FC, Wimbledon AFC, MK Dons, and Crystal Palace. This list is not exhaustive.

-Chelsea was declining in the early 00's and in 2003 was bought out by Russian oil billionaire Roman Abramovich. He paid off our debt and injected lots of £ into the club.

-Chelsea was known in the 80s and the 90s for lots of hooliganism, particularly of the white supremacist kind.

Some legends of the club include but are in no way limited to: Jimmy Floyd Hasslebaink, Joe Cole, Ricardo Carvalho, Claude Makelele, **Gianfranco Zola**, John Terry, Frank Lampard, Ashley Cole, Didier Drogba, Petr Cech, Dennis Wise, Marcel Desailly, and Peter Osgood (RIP)

According to UEFA we are the 4th top club in Europe, trailing Bayern Munich and besting Atletico Madrid.

I hope this helps. I recommend learning more than just Chelsea and a bit about other teams and the history of English top flight football. The Premier League is a new invention coming fro 1992, essentially replacing the FLC (Football League Championship) as the highest level of play. Also, learn ""banter"" because you are going to receive a lot on /r/soccer.

Addendum: A little note about our current manager: José Mourinho.

He's been our manager before, specifically after the 2003 buyout. He has big club experience such as managing clubs like Real Madrid CF and Intetnatzionale (or Inter Milan; was petty much the Barcelona of our time for the 90s, as a football/soccer fan be aware of Serie A's former dominance). Past managership and his character/persona is why he is a fan favorite.

Also, he is **Portuguese.** Do not pronounce his name as if its Spanish. the J sound is harder and it is not said as "" Hose"".

Madrid is also known for getting most players they want. They have been show to drop cash and fight for the transfers they want. Just look at the Bale transfer. They went back and forth with the Spurs until the Spurs had a deal they couldn't turn down.


Aguero would be a great player at Real as well. He would do well with the mid fielding cast Madrid has and he would be pushed to his limits to get playing time which would help his growth as a player. With BCC as the starting front line, Aguero will have a lot of competition. Plus, Real is a consistent competitor in the CL. City, only in recent years have gotten past the group stages and still can't progress past the first knockout round.

&gt; Signals and position

&gt; When taking the first exit to the left, unless signs or markings indicate otherwise

&gt; * signal left and approach in the left-hand lane
&gt; * keep to the left on the roundabout and continue signalling left to leave.

&gt; When taking an exit to the right or going full circle, unless signs or markings indicate otherwise

&gt; * signal right and approach in the right-hand lane
&gt; * keep to the right on the roundabout until you need to change lanes to exit the roundabout
&gt; * signal left after you have passed the exit before the one you want.

&gt; When taking any intermediate exit, unless signs or markings indicate otherwise

&gt; * select the appropriate lane on approach to and on the roundabout
&gt; * you should not normally need to signal on approach
&gt; * stay in this lane until you need to alter course to exit the roundabout
&gt; * signal left after you have passed the exit before the one you want.

&gt; When there are more than three lanes at the entrance to a roundabout, use the most appropriate lane on approach and through it.

So, first exit to the left is definitely left hand lane.

Doubling back on yourself is definitely right hand lane.

So it's an argument over whether this constitutes an exit to the right (in which case you are conclusively in the right, and she is conclusively in the wrong), or if it's an intermediate exit (in which case you should be in the ""appropriate"" lane, which could be argued to be either).

That said, on zooming out, I can't see why the fuck any remotely significant amount of traffic would be doubling back, since it's just come from another roundabout - there are two minor lanes that connect onto the road, but again, they'd have to make a right turn to get to your roundabout only to turn back?

Therefore, I'd say that the left lane is for going left onto Falmouth Road, the right lane is for continuing on the A394, and the lady who cut you up was in the wrong and talking out of her hoop.",null,0,null,1428424727,null,0,false,0,cq49c84,null,t3_31re6t,null,t1_cq49c84,null,t3_31re6t,null,null,null,1432248629,null,7,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,7,null

It's bad because expectations were pushed too high. The squad was made to look better than it was by the ridiculous talents of Suarez and Sturridge. Without Suarez and losing Sturridge to injury for much of the season and leaving him wanting for match fitness pretty much ruined all hopes of the season everyone wanted from the off.

It ended because our captain lost his fucking cool on the field and put us a man down against a good opponent we needed to beat.  It ended because our best defender this year cost us his services for a series of games we absolutely needed him to be there for.  It ended because we've got key players that were there for our run of good form injured, like Ibe and Lallana, and we're making do with people like Leiva or Toure who haven't played in weeks or are a drop down from who they are replacing.  It ended because Sterling or his agent decided that right in the middle of our run for the CL was the best time to 'deal with the issues' around his contract renegotiation.  It ended because we've got narrower pockets than our major competitors and can't afford the depth they take for granted. It ended because we built chemistry on the field without Sturridge, and his arrival upset the apple cart.  It ended because we've got too many selfish players who make a good show of being team people, but who really aren't at the heart of it.  It ended because we spent a lot of money on promise and people like Lovren or Balotelli are sitting rather than playing because they were never truly worth the cash we spent or are going to need a LOT of work to realize their potential.

There are plenty of smaller issues that added up, and collectively they are killing us, but only some of those are Roger's responsibility.

The game we had against Liverpool were we came out blazing should have produced something other than praise, there has to be one or more goalscorers up front. Having Ki in a false-false-false 9 role has been effective as he's more lethal than the entire Norwegian NT when getting inside the box, and hopefully he will continue the trend.

She is in the left lane, you're in the right.
You both pass the first exit, but as you move to enter the A394, the car on your left cuts across you. 

On the specific question of who was in the correct lane, I would easily say you were. She should have been positioned in the right hand lane if she was turning right.

The [highway code](https://www.gov.uk/using-the-road-159-to-203/roundabouts-184-to-190) is pretty clear on which lane you ought to have been in. You were clearly turning right. On this it says:

&gt; When taking an exit to the right or going full circle, unless signs or markings indicate otherwise
&gt; 
* signal right and approach in the right-hand lane
* keep to the right on the roundabout until you need to change lanes to exit the roundabout
* signal left after you have passed the exit before the one you want.

You weren't in the wrong by being where you were or by moving left to exit. 
 
Everyone learns to change lane in a roundabout as part of learning to drive. Anyone who gets round roundabouts by driving round the whole thing on the outside in the left hand lane is a fucking idiot. 
 
I'm not sure from her logic what traffic that enters behind you from exits that you passed are meant to do if you move out of the right lane to take your final exit - the same situation will occur, with you on the right moving left, and them already there.

I think she may be confused about whether you need to be in the right hand lane when taking an intermediate exit, as opposed to the final exit. The highway code isn't massively transparent: ""When taking any intermediate exit, unless signs or markings indicate otherwise, select the **appropriate** lane on approach to and on the roundabout."" Which is the appropriate lane? [Their own diagram](http://imgur.com/SwbOxiv) makes clear that when you go over the roundabout without turning, this can be the left lane (see the blue arrow). But as above, when you are **""taking an exit to the right""**, as you both were, she should have been in the right hand lane.
 
What should you have done? When you indicated right to exit, I'd see this as changing lanes. In this instance I would give way to traffic already in that lane, even if it meant slowing and pissing off people behind me, and even if the person on the left is a moron for being there. After all, as rule 1 states,

&gt; The rules in The Highway Code do not give you the right of way in any circumstance, but they advise you when you should give way to others.

I'm not sure what you're meaning by this to be honest.

&gt;No one cares at what step in the process the water contamination happens.

I disagree in the strongest possible fashion, knowing which stage of the extraction is to blame is entirely relevant! How are petrochemical engineers to make the extraction safe if they don't  know where the failure occurs?

We now know as of August last year that *it was not the fracking process that was to blame for gas leakage*. In layman's terms it was the fault of leaky pipes due to lax regulations and there is **no** reason for that to be the case in the UK.

&gt;never mind the earthquakes and larger question about C02 emissions

The myths of earthquakes are largely scaremongering, Durham university performed a study in 2013 that found that *""almost all of the resultant seismic activity was on such a small scale that only geoscientists would be able to detect it""* and that the magnitude of fracking-induced seismic activity is low compared to conventional mining and even reservoir water storage*. As for CO2 emissions, you'll have to point me in the direction of some sources on that one as I haven't really heard much about it.

&gt;Also it will have zero impact on our energy prices

I never said it would, but thousands of new gas extraction jobs can't be a bad thing can they?

&gt;and to top it off they can frack under my house without permission or even letting me know. 

Unless you specifically bought them you do not own the mineral rights under your property, that might seem unfair but it is the law and has been for many years.

I must say that I feel that you have already made up your mind to oppose fracking based on an incorrect perception of fracking being peddled by people who are neither scientists nor engineers.

In the AV referendum, the only parties campaigning against AV were the Conservatives and DUP. Labour were neutral, supporting the idea in principle but were against the conditions stipulated by the Conservatives on the outcome of the referendum (that a vote for AV was also a vote for the Conservatives proposed boundary changes).

Many of the people I know who voted against AV were against it purely because it wasn't PR and if reform happened to AV, then it would shut out any discussion of true PR for multiple generations.

Unless the winning party did so as a majority, they would be outnumbered in parliament. Lib Dems, Greens, UKIP and SNP are strongly in favour of electoral reform. In my scenario, where Labour get's the most seats but has less of the popular vote than Conservatives, the outcome of the election would be a spectre that would haunt the elected government until the next election. The Daily Mail would be screaming ""THE PEOPLE WERE MORE IN FAVOUR OF THE TORIES, SO WHY DID WE GET LABOUR?"", as would much of the right-wing press - PR would become a right-wing supported issue. The left-wing press has always been in favour of electoral reform. If the disparity is enough to make the Tories think ""maybe this PR idea isn't so bad after all"", you'd effectively have Labour vs the world on the debate.

Essentially in the scenario proposed, any ruling party that wants any chance of winning the 2020 election would have to open the debate again.

HR: Well there's Jeff from Google awesome CV and he's currently doing exactly what we want.

Me: How much does he cost?

HR: He's not cheap.

Program Lead: He's my first choice...

Me: But he's not cheap, who is 2nd choice?

HR: Mary from Yahoo.

Me: How much is she?

HR: 10% less than Jeff...

Me: Okay, I'm interested...

Program Lead: But I'm not sure she's right...

Me: Look she's from Yahoo and her CV is pretty much the same, surely you can make her fit.

Program Lead: But Jeff is ideal...

HR: Do you need me to make the call?

Me: Wait. Simple question... will she fit in the team and get the job done?

Program Lead: Yes.

Me: HR make the call and get the deal done.

HR: You guys called me for a meeting...

Me: Yeah, you're fired... how dare you arrange such a crappy deal with Mary (Throws brown box).

Me: Customers are complaining about our crappy software. In their stupid heads the guy that negotiates the deal is always to blame. So we cut HR loose. Now no-one knows about our role in the deal. Capische.

Transport - which is to say, moving around beyond walking distance - is something few people would argue is not a necessity. 

In many areas cars are the only practical way of travelling because public transport is so horrendous.

Primarily, it made me think and feel like...10 years ago, might that kid just have grown up as a super flamboyant male and then perhaps (or perhaps not) sexually lean towards homosexuality etc. As opposed to anything to do with transgender. 
  
I mean, if I had to pick one word to describe that kids actions and mannerisms and affectations, it wouldn't be feminine, it would be...mincing. Which I'm aware is probably a slur and I don't intend it that way but that's the best word I can think to describe that sort of behaviour. Like he didn't evolve those mannerisms naturally, and he didn't learn them from females, females don't act that way, he acted like an (overly) flamboyant male, possibly emulating behaviour he'd seen on TV or in movies. 
  
I can't help but wonder if, especially considering how supremely open the parents appeared to be to the whole idea, if they maybe didn't actually nurture the idea more than they let on. If perhaps they saw that behaviour which I guess he learned from well, I dunno, tv or whatever, and then instead of trying to get into the understanding of that behaviour or how it can be construed, just sort of went along with ""oh he is trans. That makes sense. Let's embrace this now""
  
I dunno
  
Five just seems so fucking young. You don't even really have a sense of self or identity or abstract concepts or gender or anything like that at that age...so maybe all it is, is copying behaviour he's seen on tv and enjoyed, and then that being carried along as something else. 
  
Idk
  
I hope somebody understands what I'm trying to get at here. I felt bad for the kid. I just hope they grow up into what they truly want to be, whatever that is, and they don't end up regretting any decisions. Which I guess is the whole question of the documentary.

That's why we have two wingers who can play both sides and centrally. And that's why we play Oscar who can play centrally but also a winger on either side. When we move Fabregas up into Oscars role we know longer get that. Hazard and Willian are stuck outside playing winger all game. It limits our attack. If we wanted to play that way we would have kept Mata. 

&gt;Hazard doesn't need someone to make a run so he can take people on. If anything Oscar running to his wing crowds it even more, being more detrimental. 

See this is where you don't get how we play. When Oscar goes outside it's a design play. Oscar slips out wide Hazard cuts in. Oscar drags the defensive line creating lanes for Hazard to exploit. Oscar is fully capable of playing left wing which means you still keep your formation. If you move Fabregas up we can't do that. Because Fabregas can't play on the left wing. Which makes Hazard stay out on the left wing all game. It makes us a one dimensional team. With Willian, Oscar, and Hazard you can virtually switch them in and out all game. It's brilliant. 

&gt;Watch, Oscar and Ramires are the first two out field players out the door this transfer window.

I will take that that bet. Rami won't leave because he is a great squad player. Never complains about play time and is a hard worker. Two things Jose loves. And Oscar won't be sold. To think he will be is silly.  I imagine us buying someone to compete with him tho.

&gt;Earthquake's are not a myth

Your source is a press release on **one** incident that occurred in an area where there are likely to be many pre-existing faults, not likely to be found in the UK. Your example in that link is a perfect storm of variables; many wells close together **and** a fractured geological basin and yet it **still** cased zero damage.

Well I'm not ignoring them, I even asked you to give me some links didn't I?

&gt;And now it's the 'new jobs' argument?! that's been disproven too (about 1/3 of what was reported)

You're attacking a strawman here, I never claimed it would reduce energy prices and I never even mentioned any specific number for jobs! Your *(biased by the way, FOE... really?)* source actually agrees with me that jobs **would** be created.

&gt;I wonder if you have any interest in fracking or a shill..

I linked a peer reviewed paper from the University of Utah disproving that.

I linked a peer reviewed paper from Durham University proving that is a wild exaggeration.

null,false,The_Inertia_Kid,null,null,null,"Preface: I remain baffled as to why we Brits are so desperate to buy property and become landlords. Renting can be a perfectly sensible option for many people, and you may be one of them. For even more people, it is a 'necessary evil' while you build up a deposit.

Buying residential property is not risk free. As a 24 year old, you will have no memory of interest rates being over 10%. This has happened within my lifetime, and I'm under 35. The idea that interest rates will always be low is not one you can rely on. The idea that property will always go up in value is also not one you can rely on - ask people who bought in 2006 and 2007.

A salary of £25k is not one on which you will be able to buy property in Surrey. This is a simple economic reality of the residential property market in the south east of England. A salary of £35k makes it slightly more achievable, but it is still a challenge.

My advice: focus on saving a bigger deposit. £23k may seem like a 'once in a lifetime amount of money' at your age, but it is not. It is, however, an excellent starting point that puts you ahead of most of your peers. Focus on growing this in a sensible manner for a few more years while developing your career.

Don't be in such a tearing hurry to buy a house. The best advice I ever received on this topic was ""Your house is worth exactly one house."" It is primarily a place for you to live. Its value as an investment is completely secondary to that.

Focus on excelling in your job, increasing your income, saving on a monthly basis, and building your career. Buying a house at the very start of your career puts your entire net worth into one illiquid asset, and prevents you from moving to a new area for your career. At 24, that is not wise.",null,0,null,1428428267,null,0,false,0,cq4bpvs,null,t3_31ri0p,null,t1_cq4bpvs,null,t3_31ri0p,null,null,null,1432249751,null,8,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,8,null

Everyone knew they were getting older and to me this feels a lot like what happened to my favorite baseball team the Phillies. Aging core of star players signed for too much, no way to really move them for positive assets so you take one last shot with what you have an hope it works out. Problem being it's not working out and Pellegrini is not making the necessary changes to adapt to this. 

I think the unrealistic expectations stem from form key players were in last year:

-Yaya Toure: 35 app 20 goals

-Samir Nasri 34 app 7 goals

-Edin Dzeko 31 app 16 goals

-Alvaro Negredo 32 app 9 goals

Last year represented a high water mark for Yaya, Nasri, and Dzeko and people maybe need to except that last year was an apex season for this current group of players.

Aside from that Pellegrini's game tactics still frustrate me. No way Dzeko and Navas should have been kept on after the 2nd goal, probably should have been swapped at half. I mean Nasri came on and City scored almost immediately.

It is definitely a more complex situation than Pellegrini out and this summer is going to be huge. I'm still for letting him see out his contract but if City drop from top 4 and miss out on all the big names there should definitely be a front office purge.",null,0,null,1428428591,null,0,false,0,cq4bxn5,null,t3_31qi30,null,t1_cq4bxn5,null,t3_31qi30,null,null,null,1432249853,null,2,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,2,null

rodgers should be given next season to improve results and the squad and show progress. and then finally, his 5th year, we should be challenging for a title pretty seriously. plus you have to think, if we sack rodgers, we hae to pay him like 10m, and that's 10m that could go towards recruitment of other players, PLUS sign another coach and agree long-term to pay him a large sum of money. it would be foolish right now to give up on him, from a sporting and economic standpoint. this isn't fifa, we can't just buy and sell players/coaches...we have to try to comply with FFP, increase revs, buy players, balance fans psychology, etc etc and all of that is not easy at all.

Adding a virtual interface and transparently proxying everything needs admin, but running a portable browser that tunnels its own data wouldn't. I used to use PuTTY to create a local SOCKS proxy (running on a port &gt; 1024 so I didn't need to be admin) and portable Firefox in this way, other used Ultrasurf or even Tor Browser Bundle (which is overkill for school filters)

Blocking all outgoing ports except 80 and 443 (though my school either completely blocked HTTPS or MitM'd it) mitigates this, until you switch sshd or OpenVPN etc. to port 80. Deep packet inspection can almost completely defeat it, but that's probably too much work to implement. Even if proper VPNs and proxies are blocked, PHP web proxies are easy to set up, so the only foolproof solution is an absolute IP whitelist, which will piss of the whole school as virtually everything is blocked

Blocking executables running off external media is the best tactic, but that never seemed to work completely. You could 'proxy' the execution by running the file from IE's downloads box. Also, my school took 3 years from when I arrived to put a BIOS password on, so you could boot from USB, though the network needed authentication (I'm sure a determined student could mount the Windows disk and extract the credentials)

I know these tactics are overkill, but it only takes one student to show others how to do it. I found the key to long lasting evasion was a need-to-know basis. IT admin could only take action against methods they were aware of. I only gave a few people the password to my SSH server (using a nologin account of course), so the 'authorities' never noticed

Things like association time or access to canteen can be restricted pretty easily if there is some compelling reason to do so, such as if a prisoner is deemed to pose a danger within the general population. However this doesn't apply to prison religious services and I am sure religious social congregation (such as a bible study group or Qur'an study class) also falls under this exception too. 

  I think in this case there needs to be strict vetting to ensure that ANY (including prisoners themselves) clerics that are operating there are permissible in such an.environment, and also literature, books, teaching materials as well as any media like CDs or DVDs. This would apply to all religious identities so no-one can claim victimization or that the free practice of their religion is being denied.

A lot of the players you listed were players he brought in. Xabi, Kuyt, Mascherano, Lucas, Arbeloa, Benayoun are all Rafa players. Agger too. Skrtel, Johnson (who was much better for us than he is currently), and Sterling were all at the club thanks to Rafa.

Sure there were some duds, Keane and Aquilani, but Rafa brought in some very good talent that kept us (for the most part) competitive at the top level.

Hicks and Gillett made a short term decision to a manager with a long term plan, even after steady years of improvement. Suarez leaving is a big part of why we're worse now - Alonso leaving and not being adequately replaced hurt us under Rafa. Had we stuck with Rafa through the shit times and had he made it to the FSG era, I think things would have been very different.

Like I said before, I think Rodgers is a great tactician and I like his theories on how to play football attractively and successfully. But I think Rafa is also a great tactician and a more well rounded manager. He also should be given a lot of credit for revamping our youth structure and moving the club forward instead of lingering in the early 90s.

What was lacking this season was quite simply luck, as always and good depth. Hold the leads against Man U and Tottenham, scrape a few points here and there against Villa etc. and suddenly they are a few points off Europa. Much of this also comes down to having good quality outside the starting 11 or 18.

That being said, I am not sure of the internal goings on and whether personal feelings are the reason players like zarate and amalfitano have been not seeing as much time as some would like.  If this is the case it would be best he left, but this is just speculation.

Trouble is, from my experiences, we're already on a race to the bottom, with jobcentres telling people to leave degrees and high level qualifications off of their CVs because it'll stop them getting low level work, and, again, from what I've seen, the jobcentres only seem to understand getting us into low level work, any kind of aspirational acts like training, education, or volunteering seem to be taken as suspicious at best and a direct rebellion against the system at worst.

It all feels like it's there to get anyone into the lowest grade job possible, and off the books, but that doesn't really help, if you've got skills and experience, they should be assisting you in finding work that will raise you out of the benefits system entirely, and using your damn skills, so you're not immediately replaceable and back on their books in a few months.

I'm glad you mentioned Wenger and targets, quite a good linkage. Wenger has targets at Arsenal, whether that be winning the league, trophies etc, in 9 years, before last season they hadn't won a single trophy - however they stuck by him - because he's a top manager. Surely one of their targets every season is to win some silverware? Wenger failed to do so consecutively for 9 years....yet they stuck with him. Maybe because they class 4th place as a trophy?

The British **government** have ALWAYS betrayed and fucked those who have helped them.

500 years ago the Battle of Gravelines. The British fleet was prevented from docking so sailors would die and they wouldn't have to pay them.

In WWI there were mass betrayals.

India was promised their independence if they fought for us. We welched on the deal.

The Arabs were promised Arabia if they fought for us against the Ottomans, we welched on the deal again.

120,000 Chinese labourers were bought to the UK and helped the war effort, yet there ain't one single memorial and the Chinese were literally painted out of history

When I lived in Shropshire, I was about 4 minutes walk from the train station that only had trains once every few hours and the buses outside of school hours weren't that much better and getting a taxi after the pubs had closed was a nightmare.

In Liverpool the situation is in some ways worse, there's at least 5 different bus companies, none of whom will accept each others tickets including bus passes and just trying to work out which bus you need and which stop is a nightmare.  You need to know the final destination of the bus in order to find out which stop you need to get on the bus.  And each bus company may run the same or a very similar route but will have a different route number.  So if you are in the town centre and want to go to somewhere in the suburbs you're a bit screwed.

To make it worse they don't have anything like Transport For London's Journey Planner.  In London you can just give your postcode, area, GPS etc and your destination and it will work out the best way of doing it for you subject to your preferences.  In Liverpool on their web site all you can do is download PDFs of the bus timetables of a bus route that you looked for by final destination.

There were numerous times where Parry failed to bring in his top targets (like a certain Dani Alves and Simao), then we'd go for Plan B and Plan C - but Rafa had a good deal of control over who he wanted to sign.

That control was also a big part of why he came to Liverpool after his very successful stint at Valencia. http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/columnists/steven-beacom/rafa-i-asked-for-a-table-and-they-brought-me-a-lampshade-28462855.html he asked his DOF for a player and he was brought a player he didn't want. Soon after, he was our manager.

This was before FSG decided to implement a DOF strategy (and later Rodgers' transfer committee), they felt the previous strategy of giving managers so much control over transfers was risky. I think Rafa would do well with FSG because if his top targets aren't available, he can be quite pragmatic - see signing Crouch, not the best striker in the world, but good value for money and gave us more options tactically.

I'll just say that you are arguing pieces that I don't think have a lot of relevance to what I was saying, which was that these results are very important, and Rodgers deserves criticism. Sadly, I think a lot of the stuff above that may fall into what I'd call nonsense may instead direct criticism at people who are not even involved in this. For example, who are the ""selfish players who make a good show of being team people, but who really aren't at the heart of it?"" That one gave me a good laugh.

Bottom line for me, looking at this team on paper in the summer or even a month ago, it really struggles to compete--again, on paper--with the teams of the 4 clubs ahead of us. Rodgers was able to pull this team together with a massive change in tactics, to get the team to produce in the first place. The only glaring mistake I saw from Rodgers against Arsenal was starting Sterling up front, and it showed that it was a problem, as we wasted good chances. But, that isn't even that big of an issue given who was available and at what fitness levels. 

The point still stands that a good manager has to win games when they matter, not when they don't, and that nearly *all managers* deal with all of the issues you laid out above. These past two games were the most important of the season to that point (and likely will remain the most important after the season ends). You have to win at least one of them, and absolutely can't lose both.

The Barry thing is way more complicated than that.  The first summer he tried for it (summer before the 08-09 season) Alonso was coming off a pretty bad season, and Rafa had almost no money available, he pretty much had to sell to buy.  He felt he could sell Alonso for Barry and then strengthen a couple of other areas for a net gain.  It didn't work out and we kept Alonso.  After 08-09 I think he wholeheartedly wanted to keep Alonso and play him with Barry (imagine Masch+Barry sitting and Alonso with total freedom, then Gerrard roaming in front of them all and playing off of Torres... it's narrow but if you play 1 dedicated wide man as the 5th midfielder and then have an attacking fullback on the opposite flank you can still balance it), but the damage was already mostly done.  I also don't think Alonso would have left if it wasn't for Real Madrid being the ones coming for him, so the stars aligned.  We then missed out on Barry and went straight to the injury hell that was Aquilani.  I still believe that if Aquaman wasn' perpetually injured that he could have come good for us though, albeit not in the same role/type of player that Alonso was/is.

Southampton is a terrible example because they've done almost exactly the same as what they did last year. They played very well for 1/2 of the season, they played decently well for the next 1/4, and then in the end they finished roughly where there talent deserved to finish. 

As far as this year is concerned, we can look to Laudrup at Swansea or Martinez at Everton for perfect examples of managers coming in and supposedly doing great their first season only to see it all fall apart the next because they had not consolidated anything. 

We may be in the unfortunate position now where our drop off is out of CL. But frankly fucking speaking that drop is going to happen to two decently talented teams a year right now. Even with CL and having set the world alight, we weren't able to attract star international players. We've signed players who have grown and will continue to grow into their roles over time.

* For the majority of his time, he didn't have to contend with a deep-pocketed Manchester City, and Arsenal's spending was relatively low over that time period as well (Rafa outspent Wenger most years)

* Rafa had some questionable man-management issues (like Rodgers): Gerrard complaining about getting no ""well done"" and the like, the shambles that was trying to sell Alonso and replace him with Gareth Barry

In the end we should above all look to keep what we have. Roma has been linked to Fabianski, Gomis is always iffy, Neil Taylor is drawing interest from every midtable team.

Without Europa it is going to be difficult to really draw huge names here. That said with a summer to work this diamond we've been using, we could make a push with this squad so long as we have an adequate striker. Gomis is looking like he may be that striker for us, but we'll have to see.

**Realistic Targets:**

*[Andre Pinto, CB](http://www.southwales-eveningpost.co.uk/Swansea-City-linked-Braga-defender-Andre-Pinto/story-26221209-detail/story.html)* -- I know we are spoiled for choice at centre back, but this guy look like a real prospect. Seems like we can get him on cheap, he's got a Portugal cap and he's a 6'4 beast in the middle. Monk is apparently tracking this guy pretty closely.

*[Bas Dost, ST](http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/apr/02/football-transfer-rumours)* -- Hear me out. We've been linked with him on a couple of sites and he seems to be tabling offers from Newcastle, Southampton and Stoke as well. If any of those clubs can attract him, so can we. Seems he has a £15million price tag though, so this would require us selling somebody IMO.

*[Martin Olsson, LB](http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/30884273)* -- Seems like a quick easy move we can make. We lack depth on the left and Olsson is an immediate solution to that problem.

*[Aleksander Mitrovic, ST](https://www.google.ca/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;es_th=1&amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;q=aleksandar+mitrovic+swansea+city)* -- We are constantly linked now, but I have yet to see a really reputable one.

Based on a number of factors - mainly that I think it's looking more and more likely that we could allow Oscar to leave while his market value is still somewhat high, and providing we bring the right faces in, it would allow us to get the most out of our star players; as well as tighten up the midfield 'pivot' which has been a real chink in our armour at times defensively against good opposition.

It's no secret that we're in the market for Pogba. If we did manage to prize him away from Juve, we'd probably end up needing to push Fabregas into the hole which would be a waste for a player who's proved so effective for us in deeper positions, although he's also proven to be somewhat of a liability defensively when expected to hold the midfield. Partnering him alongside a box-to-box player like Pogba, and a destroyer like Matic would only free up his game more so - without sacrificing his influence on the team. I know he's simply a squad player now, but it's worth noting that part of Ramires' mediocre form this season is because he doesn't currently own a position in our 4-2-3-1 formation; he's a bit in limbo at the moment. 

                Courtois
    Ivan   Zouma  Terry     Azpi 
               Matic          
         Pogba       Fabregas
    Willian                  Hazard
                Costa

You're putting words into everyone's mouth, mate.

Non-nationals are expected to pay for NHS treatment and are billed accordingly.

In some very few cases, the NHS cannot chase payments, or never receives payment, but all non-nationals are billed for NHS services.

Normally, there will be, as mentioned previously, either insurance cover, or reciprocal arrangement with the person's home country, whereby their government pays ours. To the patient, however, treatment remains ""free"" at the point of delivery. The billing and payment goes on behind the scenes.

Nobody objected to non-nationals getting private care outside the NHS because *that wasn't the issue being discussed*. What Farage was suggesting, and what people are blindly agreeing with, is a wholesale block on non-nationals travelling to this country to use the NHS.
