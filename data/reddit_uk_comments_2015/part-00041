null,false,The_Bravinator,lancashire,Lancashire,null,"Uggghhhh. My first experience with the American health system outside of my university (whose health center I was delighted with and still miss) was like that. I went in at 2am or so once because I was throwing up and there was blood in it. I figured it was most likely just my throat being irritated but I'd had some warnings about spleen rupture and liver problems and various other dire possibilities with the infection I had so I just wanted someone to take a look at me and tell me I was okay. I figured at 2am it'd be a quick run in and out and since I had insurance it would be a reasonable bill. My husband seemed antsy about it but I didn't understand why. I thought he just didn't want to go out in the middle of the night.

We waited hours. There was a shift change or something and it took forever. I know it must have been eight hours because at one point my husband had to run home to check on the dogs and still had time to come back. There was a guy with an obviously broken arm who was also there for a very long time with no painkillers.

The nurse said I looked a bit dehydrated. I expected a glass of water. They gave me a drip. Eventually, FINALLY, a doctor came and looked at me and told me I was okay. Actual doctor time: about 5 minutes.

The bill was like 2 or 3k. Most of it was for the fucking drip.

We are QUITE WELL OFF and have expensive insurance. I still definitely think twice before getting health issues investigated. Stuff like severe heart flutters. I know in the end I need to have it checked out but there's that real nagging ""this will cost hundreds of dollars and I'm likely fine"". In the UK I wouldn't think twice about getting that looked at. I honestly don't know what people without much money are supposed to do. They can't get preventative care. They just CAN'T. And then when they come in on death's door their lifesaving care has to be paid out of taxes anyway, making it more expensive, and probably with far less favourable outcomes for the patients. It feels like everyone loses in this system.

I won't even get into what I'm paying for maternity care right now, but trust me when I say it's had me swearing mad and in tears, and I haven't even had the baby yet. Really raised some eyebrows when I went home for Christmas and explained all the costs I'm paying to my British family. They couldn't believe it.

It was first come first served and generally meant waiting up to an hour but that is still quicker than making an appointment for several days down the line.

However seeing specialists at the local hospital in a medium sized city, I never got to choose. I would simply get a letter with a date and time. I could phone up and try to change the appointment but it usually meant pushing it back by a week or 2.

Of course you could still keep an eye out for jobs with them ([this page](http://www.edinburghfestivalcity.com/about/jobs) might help) and apply even before you get here, but it'd depend how flexible they can be with remote interviews, etc.

Also, it should be borne in mind that they may not even be recruiting at all - although the festivals take place in August, most of them are year round operations, with year round staff. There may be some extra intake for some of them, but it's not guaranteed.

One thing you could consider trying might be something at one of the major venues (Lyceum, Festival Theatre, King's Theatre, Traverse Theatre, Usher Hall, Playhouse, etc) - box office, front of house (ushers) and bar staff have higher turnover rates and, unlike more officey jobs, there's likely to be an increased demand for staff. Many of those will likely be kept on post August too, when the venues' own seasons get under way.

They can also be good ways into an organisation - eg, some friends of mine were ushers at the Lyceum Theatre, and went on to more and more senior roles there (and elsewhere) having got their foot in the door. Not always FOH roles, either, marketing, fundraising, etc.

So for a start they'd be understandably pissed that you were running a business out of your current account.

Then when they investigated the situation they discover that you're a 16 year old boy doing £40k of transactions in and out of your account, and the only explanation you can give is buying and selling bitcoins, something they probably know very little about.

null,false,Trollatopoulous,null,null,null,"&gt; When you say *God is about as close to humans as rocks are* (A), is that not basically saying that *He is so different from us that its pointless even to try to fathom His mindset* (B)

Here you basically assume that because A then B. But there's no reason you can't have A and not assume that then B. Just because god is ontologically different (to a large extent) than us doesn't mean it's pointless to try and understand him or his designs.

Nor do I say anywhere that evil is part of his design. Indeed, what I am talking is precisely about the nature of evil or if evil is really evil, or what that means. So to already assume that I somehow mean that evil is part of his design is to jump a lot of steps.

My point is, the assumption is that eye-eating insects are clearly evil and there's no reason why the universe couldn't have conceived without such ills, but the point is that from a different perspective (not human) it isn't so visibly evil and it seems more like a natural phenomena. But why should a child having his eyes eaten out be any more evil than the planet being ravaged by a tornado? Again, it's clear why *we* as humans see the first immediately as an evil, but that doesn't make it an evil objectively, or if not objectively then at least not necessarily in the eyes of god.",null,0,null,1422753114,null,0,false,0,co79n0m,null,t3_2u6v5i,null,t1_co79n0m,null,t1_co6z06e,null,null,null,1424280759,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

I also have no problem with him training with City to stay fit, but when he got that first call up, why is it OK for him to play? Why should we treat him like a legend when he is helping our ONLY true competitor in the league? 

I'm not forgetting what he has done for the club, in my heart he will always be a great professional. But nothing more. I refuse to believe he is blue-blooded, unlike Terry, Essien, Etc. because they would rather be caught dead than play for the likes of City, Arsenal or United.

Nowadays, you just see lots of fans complaining and whining about how a particular player is rubbish and shouldn't be playing for us. They somehow think they know better than those in charge at Chelsea. Attacking players that score goals are praised and the ones that rarely score goals are seen as a limitation to the team's progress. Willian has been playing really well this season and he does what he is told to do. But, even when he plays really good, it will hard for them to notice it. Some players are not just liked on this sub. It won't matter how they perform as long they are not scoring goals regularly. There are countless attacking players out there that play for big teams and rarely score goals. And yet, you won't see their fans constantly complaining about how rubbish they are. Last season, it was Mikel(almost every season to be honest) and Ramires who were seen as the weakest link. This season it is Cahill and Willian turn. If Schurrle moves on and the new signing won't perform that well, you will see lots of them saying we made the biggest mistake and the likes of Willian should have been sold instead.

My local charges about $14.50 (guts of 10 quid) for a double bacon cheeseburger, ""small"" fries and a large drink (refillable god damn litre of cola). I say ""small"" because it's basically a small carrier bag full of fries. Easily enough for two people to be fair.

I go because it is actually worth it here. Could go to Burger King or McDonalds and spend half the money but it'll be pure shit. Five Guys is actually good quality. I don't mean good for a fast food joint, actually good. Good enough quality to actually be more tasty than ""restaurants"" that charge that sort of money. Plus Five Guys (in North America at least) has ""free"" peanuts and I like peanuts so I usually fill a few little boxes of them too.

What I'd worry about is them coming to N.I and then trying to charge you 12 or 14 quid for what is, at the end of the day, still fast food. If they do, they have to make sure it's the best burger in town. In addition they'd be wise, if charging good money, not to have wee Seany or William behind the counter saying ""whadya want mate?"".

HMRC has taken to shuffling call centre staff to deal with whatever catastrophe they were criticised for last time.  The individual filing date is a known trigger for a load of calls, so people get moved over to it.  Similarly the renewal date for tax credits.

The problem this creates is two-fold.  Firstly these people are given barely enough training to deal with the calls and a huge amount of errors will be made.  Secondly, these people aren't doing their day jobs, so all that stuff (for which there already wasn't enough warm bodies to get the work done) gets neglected.

Yah, I am confused by the idea that Ibe is 'greedy' or 'selfish.'

Why not be 'greedy' or 'selfish'?

First off, his role upfront demands that he plays confidently. Furthermore, with the limited amount of time he had in a match that was already pretty much won, it was an opportunity for Ibe to showcase his wares. And surely there is pressure for Ibe to show off as well, especially at home.

And from a tactical and philosophical perspective, I believe that any young (Ibe is *only* 19-years-old) footballer who is in an attacking role should just have an uncomplicated role: Just attack.

Oversimplifying helps them gain confidence and then they can just use their raw skills. Then they can start working to make the finer adjustments. (We are starting to see that with Sterling already).

Think about it:

* Sturridge draws attention from defenders.
* That opens space for Sterling, Coutinho, Lallana, etc.
* That space allows Coutinho, Lallana, Henderson, wingbacks, to create more chances.
* Our attacking power will now take pressure off our defence (a defence that has actually been performing quite well lately).

With Sturridge's presence, I think we'll see more goals from Sterling and more assists from Coutinho and Lallana.

Like, I said, anything is possible with the return of the second highest goal-scorer in the Premier League last season.

Also, one last slightly off-topic rant, I think supporters who were angry with our form this season and angry with the new players this season were unfair because you can't lose the top two goal-scorers in the Premier League last season and then assume that things will be the same this season. Silly.

Of course, I suppose one could be angry at management for not 'replacing' Luis Suarez. But why would you when you have Daniel Sturridge? And if people argue that Sturridge is 'injury-prone' then you can argue that the likes of Sterling, Coutinho, Lambert, Borini, could all help in a pinch. It's simply unlucky that Sturridge was out for as long as he was.

No matter now. Sturridge is back and seemingly 100% fit. Let's hope it stays that way for the remainder of the season!",null,0,null,1422763536,null,0,false,0,co7et2x,null,t3_2ubxa6,null,t1_co7et2x,null,t1_co7eixg,null,null,null,1424278286,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

null,false,bitcoind3,null,null,null,"**tl;dr** 16 year old guy sells Bitcoins on local via a personal account. Account gets stopped. Guy carries on trading via two over accounts and is surprised when they get closed too.

Here is my advice: *stop trading Bitcoins now!!* If you don't you may end up without a bank account which will make your life very miserable!

Let me put some points to you:

* Banks get into lots of shit if they help fraud even by accident - just look how often you hear references to the story about HSBC helping launder cartel money on this redit.
* Banks don't care about bitcoin either way, but they do care about their reputations. They would rather kick a few small businesses to the kerb than risk accidentally laundering money.
* Banks expect businesses to use business accounts for a reason. By running a business through a personal account you are bound to upset them.
* Next time you see a gap in the market ask yourself why isn't anyone else doing what you are doing? Redit is full of stories like yours, a little research would warn you that this day was going to come up.
* Read about fraud and money laundering laws and policies, there's no presumption of innocence, and banks can't legally tell you that you are under investigation (that would count as tipping you off - which is conspiracy to fraud). This explains why there are long gaps and lies in all their stories.

It's not all bad news. If you have patience and politely pursue your money, and provide all the documentation etc etc, you'll probably get your money back eventually, though it will likely take months (let us know). At this stage it's hard to know whether it would be best to stick it in a savings account or investment product for a few years, or take it out of the system as cash as soon as you can. Maybe do some research?

Whatever happens, keep these funds separate from the funds you need to run your day to day life. Do not get back into the bitcoin trading business again!

null,false,kopking08,null,null,null,"""Can and probably will come good"" is a terrific overstatement. The chance that Balotelli, with things having gone as they have, is ever going to get a proper shout in the starting lineup is absurd. We have found a way to operate with one striker and, ultimately, that's the way Brendan wanted it all along. We played with Sturridge and Suarez because they were our two best players. Now that we have proper attacking talent behind Studge, there is no reason to suspect we are ever going to give Balotelli a proper run in the side unless we have injuries to Borini and Lambert this year and Origi and whoever else we might bring in (Ings, etc) next year. 

Balo is effectively done having done nothing to suggest he will ever earn us our investment in him. Both for his transfer fee and his wages. The most likely thing to happen is he will be signed on loan next year and we will continue our history of signing and loaning players who should be starting or pushing for starting spots. We aren't Chelsea, City, or United. We can't afford that sort of thing.

The only chance we have of breaking even (only on his transfer fee, we can't even consider his wages which have been wasted on the sort of lazy, tired, but occasionally seemingly brilliant play we all expected) is if he manages to do well for whoever loans him. 

But let's consider that Italy remains his most likely destination. None of those clubs have money to just throw around. We have been spoiled by the idiocy of lower table English clubs, giving us the impression that someone like Borini or Carroll could be worth what was offered for them. 

Only in England. And I can assure you, Balo will not end up at another English club. ",null,0,null,1422769059,null,0,false,0,co7hc7a,null,t3_2ude5w,null,t1_co7hc7a,null,t1_co7deql,null,null,null,1424277105,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

Lambert was signed on June 2.  Before Suarez bit Chiellini.  I think BR was going into the year thinking he had Suarez, Sterling, Sturridge, Borini and Lambert.  They were already making eyes at Lallana and Markovic.  

After Suarez did what he does.  The plans all changed.  They had to replace Suarez without being able to replace him.  

Bony, Remy and a few other strikers were linked and slowly the number kept getting smaller and smaller.  We were priced out of a move for Bony, Remy went tits up and Balotelli seemed to be the only viable alternative as he was bitten in the ass before when the whole Carroll gets sold without replacement debacle.  

So now there is a rather glut of average strikers at the club when all Liverpool really need is a finisher.  

My guess is Lambert goes in the summer and so does Balotelli.  Borini has rejected moves and looks to be at the club for at least another year.

Should he, though, for a 3rd-choice striker? Keep in mind that we needed to add a lot of players to the squad this season - given X amount of money, how much do you allocate to 3rd choice striker? I'd be surprised if it's more than 4m, and for that price Lambert's done fine.

&gt; He should be doing better than Dejan Lovren

No arguments, Lovren's been disappointing. At the time of the rumours, though, he looked a very good potential signing, did he not?

&gt; Rodgers is not forced into anything. He has the last say on transfers.

Agreed. But by this stage, his two options are: go through the first half of the season with a strikeforce of injury-prone Sturridge, Lambert, and maybe Borini (the club were still hopeful they'd move him on at this point), or an injury-prone Sturridge, Balotelli, Lambert and maybe Borini.

Once he's backed into that corner, I don't begrudge him deciding to bring in Balotelli. I hate that it reached that situation, though, and it's happened too many times before where the committee +/- Rodgers have struggled when their plan A signing falls through.

&gt; The transfer business of this club is shambles. And a large part of that reason is Brendan Rodgers.

Agreed, however when we dont have a first choice one, and one that we have is made of glass, you need to fill that slot first rather than spending even a penny on a 4th choice. Not having a 4th choice will not cost you the same as not having a first choice. We were toothless for the first half this year. It was sorry to watch. 

&gt;  At the time of the rumours, though, he looked a very good potential signing, did he not?

Personally, I had no opinion either way. It was wait and watch. The thing is I dont handle transfers, nor am I the manager. I am an armchair fan who has an opinion and a strong one about Rodgers because it hurt to see rare money being wasted.

&gt; Once he's backed into that corner, I don't begrudge him deciding to bring in Balotelli. I hate that it reached that situation, though, and it's happened too many times before where the committee +/- Rodgers have struggled when their plan A signing falls through.

I think he should have held onto the 16 million. Add 4 million of Lambert to that and you have 20 million to look for a good striker in January. Transfers happen in Jan. Good ones. Sturridge and Coutinho happened in January.

&gt; But I just don't see him as a large part of the reason. Why do you think he is?

If I have a team working for me and advising me on things and I am the one that needs to make the final call, then I should be the one bearing the brunt of any fuck ups that have been made. Likewise, I will take the credit if the decision pays off. Which is the reason I credit the success of Sturridge and Coutinho, Markovic and Can (potentially) to Rodgers and not the committee.

Brendan most likely wouldn't want to change the system, since it's been working well for the past couple of months. Just because Sturridge is back, I don't think he'll change the shape of the team.

I think the most important reason to keep the shape of the system, though, is for our defense. Ever since Rodgers took over, the Liverpool defense hasn't been great.

However, there are retractions of software patenting so often s.11 CDPA 1988 is more relevant (s.11). ""Course of employment"" does not mean any time whilst you were employed, but I should warn you that it isn't cut and dry about where you work by any means - even if you don't normally work outside your hours at home you can still be caught by these sections/your contract quite easily. If the *kind* of software you programme at home is similar to that at work the ""home"" stuff can easily fall to the employer. You said that is not the case here, but there is no hard and fast rule so there is still the risk. The law does favour the employer in these situations, so people get caught out. Even if it is legally yours, an entitlement dispute in court is long, messy and very expensive.

Being the smaller party, they'll be forced into making concessions elsewhere in return, but the point is that many people think that tuition fees was literally the single most important thing that the LDs promised and therefore worth concessions elsewhere.

The course takes up most of the north of the island, so you can't go anywhere unless you are inside the course up there. This is where the OS map is a great idea, you can see all the routes easily if you highlight the course. You can get a short distance in between races, but the roads are totally mobbed by everyone else doing the same thing, so it's hard to make progress.

If you can't find a spot in douglas, don't lose hope, there are plenty of places around the island, which isn't very big anyway, so it's easy to get about.

For energy I would suggest comparing your current consumption to an online estimation tool to workout if that tool is accurate for you. Then plug in the details of the smaller place.

The benefit of 3 at the back is that we can play Sakho and Can who have good distribution and are able to get the ball into Coutinho and Lallana. If we play 4 at the back, Can would most likely be dropped because he doesn't really have enough experience to play centre back and would probably be caught out a lot. This limits our distribution into midfield and we will most likely go back to playing a million passes between defender and Migs before Migs tries to kick it long and it inevitably goes out for a throw. 

Then there's the full backs. Marko and Moreno have been doing very well as Wing backs, by neither make very good full backs. Marko is winger so naturally he's gonna be a rubbish full back, Manquillo could come in but he has been inconsistent at times and who knows where Flanagan is. Moreno for me is too attacking to play full back, at least with our defence, and has been caught up the pitch a lot. He's also shown to be very one footed which has led to us conceding goals on occasion this season. When playing as wing backs, these shortcomings aren't shown up as much since there's less responsibility on them to be the last line of defence and they can focus more on attacking

I asked a girl sitting in the library where security was and she pointed me to their office.  I went and explained what had happened and they gave it back to me.  I did ask if he could try and find out who had left it at the desk but he said nope.

Make do. 

&gt; What I'm reading is that you're ok with punishing children for their parents' choices/misfortune.

It isn't punishing children at all to provide a benefits safety net. The argument is spurious or are we punishing children by not giving them all £1m per year? The safety net is supposed to be just that, not a cost-effective lifestyle choice.

&gt; I would be less bothered if some money was diverted into providing for the children directly or indirectly such as free school meals or school trips as another commenter said

Free school meals are already being rolled out to youngest children, you'll be happy to hear. But poor (financial) parents doesn't equate to poor (quality) parents and it is morally right that this distinction is drawn whilst ensuring that the Mick Philpott's of this world cannot use children as a means of increasing their income.

&gt; You may be interested to hear that ESA(C) is now (and has been for at least a year) time limited to 12 months unless one is in the support group and we've all heard about ATOS/DWP's track record there. 

The problem is with the implementation, not the policy. 

&gt; That was introduced with the first benefit cap but flew under the radar because lazy scum stealing my hard-earned tax money!!

People not able to afford children being subsidised to have them by others who cannot afford to have children but would like to or living in central London when others cannot does indeed provoke feelings of ""lazy scum stealing my hard-earned tax money!!"" Understandably so, surely?

If you want more people off benefits and skilled into professional roles like nurses or teachers they need the time and money for training and running their households. 

She is a rags to riches story, but with all these stories there is always either/both the state or the support of someone they know to help fund or give them the time/space to work on there businesses. This is usually down to luck, because lot of people can work hard but not have such opportunities in time/money. 

Her husband was a copper mine owner in south Africa. Even if he didn't give her money, he might have been able to run the household while she worked on her businesses or had the network into BUPA where she sold her company too.  

I only point this out since politicians who claim the rags to riches through only their hard work, tend to make/support polices which crushes opportunities low income people have and argue they need to work harder like they did. When in fact they had lot of luck and support from others and state during those hardships.

A different club would have him cast as an effective winger, utilising his pace. Telling him to get his head down, get down the line and put a cross in. He'd be in the category of Shaun Wright Phillips, Aaron Lennon, Ashley Young, Jesus Navas. Over time he would have picked up a limited skill-set on the periphery. 

Rodgers has used him in a much more flexible way, giving him central duties, making him integral and yesterday we see him score a stunning centre-forward's goal, the kind that Michael Owen used to score. he drifts between a Hazard position (with the physical strength), a false-nine role, and isn't scared to drop to the half-way line and recycle the play much as you see Messi do (though obviously I'm not making a straight comparison here). Doing this kind of work increases his influence on the team and makes him harder to pin down. It's promising when you think about where Ibe could be in a season or two with the same application and opportunities. What I most enjoy about Raheem recently is that he wants the ball so badly and gets angry when he, or his teammates mess up.

This might be true if we took the the top 100 greatest Britons as an example. IIRC, our list compared to most other European nations is more likely to be made up of military, political and scientific figures. ~~Not a single artist, philosopher, mathematician or poet* on the top 100.~~ Our attitudes to maths and philosophy is probably the one thing that really sets us apart from the continent; for some reason there are people who are proud they don't know the times table, which is like saying they are proud they can't read. 

I think Burke has a point, and why maybe socialism in Britain never really took off, we prefer more natural and piecemeal change to radical plans and abstract ideals. We still have unelected hereditary Lords in our second chamber, we never did away with them.  

*Newton and Shakespeare have made contributions to maths and poetry, but that's not why they are on the list.

Then there must surely exist

 - £Y, between £0 and £X, where there are fewer adverts or more channels available to you -- i.e. both adverts and subscription; but that subscription is lower than £X.

Sky might offer so many channels, that they rely on the subscription fee and the advertiser income to pay for them.

That's one explanation.  The other is ""because they can"".  There is another spectrum:

 - Number of subscribers when Sky's price is £100000 a month: 0%
 - Number of subscribers when Sky's price is £0 a month: 100% of market (approximately)

So then there must exist a price in between 0 and 100000 a month that will get them somewhere between 0% and 100% of the market.  They will be selecting their price to maximize `number_of_subscribers x price_per_month`.  Nobody forces anyone to have Sky; and it isn't a basic human requirement.

In Sir Terry Pratchett's  book 'Night Watch' he depicts an uprising / revolution occurring in Ankh Morpork and he has the reluctant participant Sam Vimes - who is probably the epitome of a solid, common sense, practical thinking English character as one can find in all English literature - say something along the lines of:

&gt;'at heart what revolutionaries fail to understand is that for the vast majority of people what they really want is for tomorrow to be quite like today.'

George Orwell said

&gt;""after all the other 'isms' have been discredited pessimism will still reign supreme""  

We like a 'lash up' a 'that'll do approach' that keeps us grounded in the reality of the here and now rather than the abstraction of promises of a brighter tomorrow which experience tells us never quite works out - the old 'the grass does indeed appear greener on the other side but that's usually because its been fertilised with so much bullshit.

A good physical embodiment of this is the HQ of the Prime Minister - in almost very other country the seat of real power is some magisterial building deliberately designed to cause some kind of awe and wonder - what do we have?  We have 10 Downing Street a place that looks like the home of  a moderately successful 19th century surgeon. 


There is a deep and abiding strain of intellectual pursuit in the UK - academia would collapse without it - but what there also is a well founded strain of anti intellectualism at the level of everyday discourse which you may or may not find limiting but then the mark of any great artist or thinker is the ability to make an abstruse subject comprehensible to everyday reader or listener. 

Shakespeare did this - of course we find him a tad difficult but his contemporary audience would have understood him perfectly - and no artists before or since has every touched so deeply upon the human condition.

I think it also explains the British healthy wariness  beyond lip service with religion. Our attitude is quite Homer Simpson like;


&gt;Bart:  Homer what religion are we?
  Homer: I don't know son, probably one of those one's with all the   
  good ideas that don't work in the real world

So if a person can't tell what is good or evil from the standpoint of a god, they have no chance of meeting that standard (and indeed it's unacceptable to judge them, as it would be to judge the rock as evil for falling on your head).

If they can, then they can judge god by those same standards - and it doesn't come out well.

Of course, if you recognise that religions are created by man - then it's no surprise that the god thus created is a vengeful, lusty, idiot - it's just a mirror held up to those barbarians that created the story in the first place.

Don't see a problem with it.

&gt; Should someone who's overweight and in poor fitness drive?

Don't see a problem with it unless there are known medical issues with the person.

&gt; How is this an even-handed application of the law? 

Different charges maybe? he was fount guilty of careless driving while she pleaded guilty to a charge of causing serious injury by dangerous driving, she had been warned by doctors that she should not be driving and she claimed to have tested herself before driving and was fit to drive then at the next test which would have been done shortly after the crash shown her well below the safe limit which the prosecution sould have highlighted.

Having been warned not to drive she really can't complain about the punishment.

Plant medicines are not as good as modern medicines, but if you get an infection or wound in the middle ages you're not going to die instantly. A lot of the time you will live. 

I don't know where you live but here almost all guns are illegal, you can't hunt with a bow and arrow and having a weapon for self defense in your house isn't legal.    

To  build your own house you need planning permission, so to build a house to live in in a traditional way is almost impossible. It is very difficult to get permission to build a house. If you want to live sustainably, off the grid in the western world is impossible. You get rare cases but they use guns and have money, if you want to live off the land you can't do it without breaking the law.

Food stores being raided by passing armies 

1. wasn't common

2. Many churls buried things underground where people couldnt find them


3. i said every civilisation has had its flaws. Dark ages had slaves, war, etc but they were closer to nature and respected the enviroment a lot more.  


'ought to give the tenant, for the occupation of the land: two oxen and one cow and six sheep and seven sown acres on his piece of land. He is to perform all the duties which appertain to him throughout the year. And they are to give him tools for his work and utensils for his home. When death befalls him, his lord is to take charge of what he leaves.'

This is what the lowest rank of churls had. THey had to work for their lord but their lord had to care for them. Slaves (it wasn't good being a slave, but it wasn't hell) could earn their way to freedom or pay for it or their masters let them go. This is what slaves had 


'One slave ought to have as provisions: twelve pounds of good corn and the carcasses of two sheep and one good cow for eating and the right of cutting wood according to the custom of the estate. For a female slave: eight pounds of corn for food, one sheep or threepence for winter supplies, one sester of beans for Lenten supplies, whey in summer or one penny. All slaves ought to have Christmas supplies and Easter supplies, an acre for the plough and a 'handful of the harvest', in addition to their necessary rights.'

Too many times this season i've watched him mindlessly take a shot on from 25 yards purely because of his power and technique, when there were plenty of other things he could have done with the ball. As a striker, he should be making runs, splitting defenders, and getting in the box - too many times have i seen him stay deep, stay deep, stay deep. I'm there screaming at the TV telling him to get in the box. Instead, gets the ball deep, takes a touch, either falls over or blasts the ball into row Z. He depends too much on his physical footballing talent, and not enough on his footballing brain. Liverpool want to play classy, play clever. Let's face it, it just isn't working. Also, now that Studgey's back, I'd rather have an extra man in midfield (Lallana) than have Balotelli on up front with him. Heck, i'd rather see the new S&amp;S up front.

Look. I need to be a bit more balanced about this. I waded into this thread mostly to take a contrarian position in support of Morrissey defending his principles, as so many people seemed to be lazily and baselessly criticising him. I do think in the long term raising animals to eat is going to become unsustainable - there'll just be too much demand for food and it's too inefficient growing crops to feed to livestock which we have to wait years before we can eat. It takes up too much room, it's energy inefficient and the animals produce too many greenhouse gasses.

As a Scotchman, I'm generally not offended by the comments made against my proud and unique cultural heritage, by a bunch of self important, UKIP voting, cricket playing, pims drinking, ""we won the war"" sassenaches.

That said, sometimes it does go too far and there are a small number of unpleasant racists out there, convinced that the Scots are getting rich on the backs of our neighbours. (if you're not from the UK, and want to gaze into the cold dead eyes of xenophobia, take a look at the ""comments"" section of any UK news websites' stories about Scottish politics.)

EDIT:  Oh, look, downvotes for the guy who mentions that not all anti-Scot comments are ""banter"", and there are a few racists out there.

To clarify - I am well aware that there are plenty of unpleasant racists in Scotland.  Trust me, I live here.  They exist.  OPs question, however, was on anti-Scottish sentiment.  I was merely pointing out that, whilst largely lighthearted and in good humour, some of it is genuinely hateful.  Had OP asked a more general question about racism in the UK, I would have been the one of the first to throw Scottish racists under the bus.

The first leg of the flight (SYD&gt;DOH) was good as the seats were much wider than usual for an economy flight and it was an A380. However, the food was hideously awful - processed croissants and unripe fruit too sharp to eat for breakfast, greasy lamb with overcooked veg for lunch and a chickpea/sweetcorn wrap for supper. 

Stopped over at Doha, and we actually had to walk off the plane onto a runway, then catch a shuttlebus to the airport (not an aerobridge) The wait time was less than an hour, but the airport lounge was pretty shabby and looked like a hospital waiting room.

On the second half of the flight (DOH&gt;LHR) we were loaded onto a tiny plane where the seats felt smaller than RyanAir. They had also oversold the tickets (a guy was sitting in my seat, although he was right to sit there as his seat number was the same as mine on his ticket) so they upgraded me to business class which was 70% empty, but then they found a spare seat for me as someone else didn't turn up and they made me downgrade back to economy, or pay the difference ($620)!

1. I've always been very happy with my course and how it has been taught. Friendly and professional lecturers, decent structures for almost all the modules I took, and plenty of avenues to get help if you're struggling. There is a department wide (university wide, possibly?) open-door policy, which has certainly been followed by all the staff that I've had contact with. Also very happy with how my PhD is progressing. The department I work in produces international standard research.

2. I love this city, and it's very student friendly. Scousers are known for the their friendliness, and in my experience the reputation is well founded. Excellent night life, and whatever you're into there's something for everyone. Some areas are nicer than others, of course, but I've never felt unsafe. Still, it is a city which does mean a certain amount of crime. You can check the statistics yourself but I think the crime rates in Liverpool are comparable or better than most other cities in the UK. Use some common sense and you shouldn't have anything to worry about. There's plenty of culture and history around, if that interests you, and some beautiful buildings dotted around the city. 

3. Cost of living is pretty low, for the UK. you'll be hard pressed to find anywhere in England that is significantly cheaper. A pint is typically between £2.70 and £3.20 Studenty places can be cheaper.

4. I've never taken public transport to the airport, so can't answer this. Public transport in general, though, is very good. Private hire taxis are cheap and reliable.

5. Most of the negatives I can mention here are the same ones you'll get for any city: crime I've already mentioned. Lack of countryside (probably not an issue for most people, but I grew up in the country and I do miss it sometimes). The accent can take a bit of getting used to. 

6. I guess I've made it fairly obvious that I love this city and am very glad I chose to come to uni here. However I don't have any experience of a different university, and I might have been just as happy if I had gone somewhere else. I will also add that there is a lot of identity around being a 'scouser' and most locals here are very proud of their city. I could live my entire life here and I would never become a scouser. I think I would still feel like a Southerner who happens to live in Liverpool. That isn't to say they haven't made me feel welcome, however, and this place does feel like home to me now.

I think you're trying to change things by factors of 10 until the number feels right rather than just going back to the very basics. Either that or putting numbers into the calculator without thinking about what they mean (0.5 vs 50, etc.)

&gt; If so they'd be worth £23,400 then today which still isn't half bad!

If they were half a penny, then for £1000 you could buy 200,000 of them (200 half pennies in a pound). If you have 200 thousand things each worth over a pound, the total value must be over £200,000. In fact, your original calculation holds assuming half a penny price to begin with.

You have to think about whether your answer makes sense, not just taking numbers from the calculator as fact. In your original post you had 2000 shares worth £1.17 each, which can't possibly be worth much more than £2000.

-----
If there is a dislike for ""intellectualism"", my guess:

- intellectualism associated with being educated, associated with higher classes &amp; their accents
- because there's a class divide/dislike for the rich, there is a dislike for intellectualism, the fact that the rich tend to have a certain accent makes it easier to discriminate to perpetuate this dislike.
- common sense, being what 'commoners' have, what makes up a lot of the population, is how commoners ""speak"" rather than speaking in a ""posh"" way, which has connotations of being intellectual.

If there is a dislike for intellectual on a societal scale atm, surely it'd be mostly due ~~to this reverse snobbery/dislike for the posh (due to their wealth)~~ [clearer rewording] dislike for the posh, which means stereotypical aspects of them will be disliked (intellectualism). Why there is dislike for the posh? That's due to their wealth &amp; their snobbery in the first place. So basically anti-intellectualism is just reverse snobbery (looking down on the posh)...

All the parties agree on almost everything. Considering we have had a recession, expenses scandal, three wars, a referendum on the future of our country and a referendum on our voting system the fact our politics is exceptionally stable is more noteworthy than there being a rift.

The entrenching of colonialist and apartheid features of the Israeli occupation has been a cumulative process

and

&gt; Among the salient apartheid features of the Israeli occupation are the following: preferential citizenship, visitation and residence laws and practices that prevent Palestinians who reside in the West Bank or Gaza from reclaiming their property or from acquiring Israeli citizenship, as contrasted to a Jewish right of return that entitles Jews anywhere in the world with no prior tie to Israel to visit, reside and become Israeli citizens; differential laws in the West Bank and East Jerusalem favouring Jewish settlers who are subject to Israeli civilian law and constitutional protection, as opposed to Palestinian residents, who are governed by military administration; dual and discriminatory arrangements for movement in the West Bank and to and from Jerusalem; discriminatory policies on land ownership, tenure and use; extensive burdening of Palestinian movement, including checkpoints applying differential limitations on Palestinians and on Israeli settlers, and onerous permit and identification requirements imposed only on Palestinians; punitive house demolitions, expulsions and restrictions on entry and exit from all three parts of the Occupied Palestinian Territories

Geography of Iran
When ""Persia"" became ""Iran""
This article is a part of ""Persia or Iran"" by Professor Ehsan Yarshater, published in Iranian Studies, Vol. XXII, No.1, 1989.


In 1935 the Iranian government requested those countries which it had diplomatic relations with, to call Persia ""Iran,"" which is the name of the country in Persian. 

The suggestion for the change is said to have come from the Iranian ambassador to Germany, who came under the influence of the Nazis. At the time Germany was in the grip of racial fever and cultivated good relations with nations of ""Aryan"" blood. It is said that some German friends of the ambassador persuaded him that, as with the advent of Reza Shah, Persia had turned a new leaf in its history and had freed itself from the pernicious influences of Britain and Russia, whose interventions in Persian affairs had practically crippled the country under the Qajars, it was only fitting that the country be called by its own name, ""Iran."" This would not only signal a new beginning and bring home to the world the new era in Iranian history, but would also signify the Aryan race of its population, as ""Iran"" is a cognate of ""Aryan"" and derived from it.",null,0,null,1422798754,null,0,false,0,co7ovf1,null,t3_2uavng,null,t1_co7ovf1,null,t1_co7mvfx,null,null,null,1424273530,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

I just don't see the point at all in playing Moreno on the right when that will change the way he goes about his defensive responsibilities so much.

That is the cross.  Moreno with his head down simply putting the ball in the basic area.  So you are comfortable with saying that having him kick ball that goes off Sterling, then Reid's face and falls to Coutinho is the best we can get from him.  Alright.  That is offensive genius.  

Crossing the ball doesn't work.  Am I fucking crazy in thinking crossing the ball into an area with tiny pacy forwards isn't a great idea?  That maybe having a player with a stupendous left foot, clear offensive ability and allowing him the advantage of facing the goal if he cuts inside isn't a bad idea.  

The only thing that changes is which way the goal is.  Everything else is the same.  You cover the person in that space on that side.  I'm not saying play him as a CB, it is just on the other side.  

Yes, I do.  I think he is being wasted putting in hopeless crosses or giving the ball up (which he does a lot) when he has to cut in using his weak foot first.

You shouldn't really need a pest control firm unless you've got some sort of enormous infestation. They're pretty common in the UK and if you live in an old house (1830s here) you can rely on them popping up at least once a year.

A note about siting your traps - if you can place them with the long edge up against something (mine usually go against the skirting board and alongside the sofa) you will hugely increase the chances of one of your furry friends running into it.

Other stuff you can buy includes sonic deterrents and poison - these along with traps are available from local hardware stores and bricosheds like B&amp;Q and Homebase. I use sonic deterrents in the bedrooms to try and lower the chances of me hearing them while I'm trying to sleep. I tried poison in bait boxes but you potentially run into two problems with these: (1) you have no control over where they peg out and (2) you may well encounter the problem I did, where one enters the bait box, gets stuck and goes to town on the poison block. The mouse's reaction to this was enough to propel the bait box about six inches across the floor with the little bugger still inside it. Your task is then to dispose of the bait box with the fast-expiring mouse irretrievably stuck inside.

As for the ""eternity of bliss"", I choose to interpret the wiping away of tears and the ""no more death or mourning or crying or pain"" and the ""water without cost from the spring of the water of life"", as a pretty good hint.

[According to Wikipedia:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeast_extract) 

&gt;The general method for making yeast extract for food products such as Vegemite and Marmite on a commercial scale is to add sodium chloride (salt) to a suspension of yeast, making the solution hypertonic, which leads to the cells shrivelling up; this triggers autolysis, in which the yeast self-destructs. The dying yeast cells are then heated to complete their breakdown, after which the husks (yeast with thick cell walls) are separated. Removing the cell walls concentrates the flavours and changes the texture.#

That is why there is a huge increase in landlords in the market. People remortgage homes to buy second and third homes to rent out. 
I myself know of a minimum of 2-3 family friends that own more than one home due to this. These people are not from 'rich' backgrounds, and dont have the best paying jobs. They still have to pay a mortgage due to remortgaging their home, but in another 10years when they are due to retire they will have a nice income from rent.
Im no mortgage expert and i find it extremely hard to find decent advice about buying a home, which is why id love someone to compare the prices back then to now. Including interest rates and inflation im assuming the prices were a lot less back then to now.
You only have to look at the age your parents/my parents (not sure on your age) when they bought their home compared to yourself.

By adding up a bunch of sixes? Isn't that an extremely impractical and slow way of doing it? Or do you mean that you memorize *parts* of the multiplication tables, and work out the rest? If you're memorizing enough of the table that you can access the whole thing quickly enough for practical purposes, that'll be fine, but it's more or less equivalent to rote learning of the whole thing.

&gt;Rote learning of the tables just leads you into trouble when you need to multiply 6.5 by 6.25 and don't have an answer stored in your head. 

The traditional pencil and paper algorithm for multiplying 6.5 by 6.25 (and most of the sane algorithms I can think of) still presumes you know what 6 multiplied by 6 is. Memorization of the table up to at least 9x9 (or enough of the table to access the answers quickly) doesn't hamper longer multiplications in the slightest, it's almost essential to the process.

null,false,oatcrunchie,null,null,null,"&gt; I'm American

I figured as much.

&gt; a lot of the jokes at various groups expense aren't quite harmless since there is commonly very real and prevalent inequality between them

Look, the reality is that *we know* all of this.

When we call the Welsh sheepshaggers we aren't blind to the fact that rural communities in Wales faced a tough time when the mines closed or that farming no longer provides the livelihood that it used to.

When we call Scousers thieves we aren't blind to the fact that there is a lot of real and enduring depravation and crime in Merseyside, exacerbated by the collapse in heavy industry in the 1980s.

When we call the Scots alcoholics and heroin addicts we aren't blind to the fact that again, there are very real problems in Scotland with obesity, alcoholism and poor health outcomes - the ""Glasgow Effect"" is a real thing and heroin addiction blighted a great many communities in Scotland and still does.

*We know*.

&gt; So jokes about a group being lazy or freeloading would be pretty insensitive since a member of that group is liable to actually face difficulty getting jobs or loans because of that stereotype

We don't need Americans to tell us how shit our lives can be sometimes or that people have problems with unemployment, with door-step lending, with addiction, with abusive relationships or with any one of a million other possible problems.

Black humour has long been recognised as a way of coping with difficult experiences and it's not different here. 

It's also highly contextual and really depends on the interpersonal relationships that people have and the individual circumstances.

If you overheard me telling my unemployed friend down the pub that he should sell his first-born child to medical science to pay his electricity bill you would probably think I was some monstrous excuse for a human being, but we can do that because *we are friends*.

You would also probably be so outraged at what you heard that you wouldn't notice that not once had my friend put his hand in his pocket and that I was buying his beer all night, because I care about my friend and that I recognise that it's pretty shit being unemployed (most of us have been there), and that if I'm in a position to take him out for an evening and get him out of the house then I will do that.

Things aren't always what they seem on the surface.

&gt; But yeah obviously I was projecting way too much American society into UK society.

I never learned my times tables off by heart, I just know how the numbers fit together and have a good knowledge of powers of two as well as square numbers. From there I can calculate most multiples fairly easily.

What's 6 x 8? I don't know, but what I do know is that it can also be written as 2 x (3 x 8). I know that's 2 x 24. Doubling 24 is easy. Problem solved.

It's not quite as fast as simply memorising everything off by heart, but it works for any numbers.

What's 36 x 71? It's (30 x 70) + (6 x 70) + (1 x 30) + (1 x 6).

The problem now is the older generstion is so huge, the amount of tax they pay, despite being larger isn't enough to cover all of the pensions and healthcare they are receiving.

Go to any A&amp;E department and it is full to the brim of over 60's. Most of them have pensions that are worth well more than what they paid in, own houses that are worth well more than 3-4 times what they originally paid and worked when wages were rising well well above the rate of inflation.

But the younger generation who are far smaller in number, use A&amp;E much less, haven't even began dreaming of having enough for a pension, will never be able to afford a house let alone see it quadruple in value, have seen wages drop in relation to inflation consistently for the past 4-5 years with the exception of this year's 0.1% increase helped by inflation dropping below 2% have to pay more than what they get out.

You can come up with snappy retorts just like Cameron tries to paper over the blatant cracks by claiming unemployment has dropped at the same time his government has been actively forcing people into forced slavery with the non-optional back to work scheme that forces people to work 40 hours a week for their benefit money.

Insurers like to protect themselves and they do so with generalisation. An x year old driver with no claims history on y make of car is statistically likely to cost us £z over a 10 year period.

Modifications make generalisations difficult. You may be driving a £500 undesirable Nissan Micra, but if you've put a [V6 engine](http://www.beardmorebros.co.uk/Images/Thunder%20races/28%20micra.jpg) into it, it's no longer the same car. Many insurers can't use their statistics to work out what this will do and so avoid it.

A sticker does nothing to a car, but if the sticker says ""I bet you can't steal me"" or ""Please Smash my Windows"", it's inviting damage and theft. A plain white van is less attractive to theives than one which says ""Herbert's Gold Merchants"" on the side, so again they just prefer to avoid.

Some insurers will put a hefty premium assuming the worse and to discourage this kind of activity.

There are a few however who are smart, and hire smart people (I like to think so anyway being employed at one). When someone says they've swapped the engine or added a sticker, we find out what, why and use common sense logic to work out what impact that has on the risk.

I think you're ignoring the demographic shift - people are living far, far longer than they used to thanks to advances in medical technology and social conditions.

Whereas in the past the state could afford to pay for someone to live 5-10 years after retirement, now the state may have to pay out for 20, 25 years or possibly even more in the future.

That was never budgeted for, although it's not a uniquely British problem - all advanced economies have to face up to this.

&gt; Go to any A&amp;E department and it is full to the brim of over 60's. 

So?

Old people get ill, it's one of the things that happens when people get old.

&gt; Most of them have pensions that are worth well more than what they paid in

Well you would bloody well hope that a private pension is worth far more than what was paid in.

As for the State Pension - see above re: demographic change. 

People were never meant to live this long when the State Pension was instigated.

You can either cry about it, or you can accept that whilst the situation isn't one of your own making, you're still going to have to live with the consequences - the state will not be able to afford to support us all to the same extent in the future.

&gt; will never be able to afford a house 

Perhaps not the in 4bd detached house that they would LIKE to stay in, but everyone has to start somewhere and work upwards.

There are houses out there, just not in areas that you would want to live in.

I was looking just yesterday at houses and saw a very nice detached house at £450,000 that I would very much like to live in, if only I could afford it. I also saw a flat at £30,000 that I would very much not like to live in, but I could mortgage it tomorrow if I really wanted to buy somewhere.

I guarantee that if you told me your rough geographical location then I could go on Rightmove and find an affordable property for you, but you would need to accept that it wouldn't be in a prime area and that you might need to commute to work *just like everybody else*.

&gt; have seen wages drop in relation to inflation consistently for the past 4-5 years

Yes, that's what happens in a recession and this is the second that I've lived and worked through.

They will go back up again and within the next 15 years, probably go back down due to yet another recession.

These things are cyclical and you shouldn't look at the current situation and imagine that things are fucked for ever and ever more.

But, save yourself some time and escalate this up, give up with the normal customer service channel, What you need to do is:

1. Contact the CEOs office (get the details from [ceomail.com](http://www.ceoemail.com), and raise an official complaint about it.

And yet at least half of all redditors on this sub will argue that cuts are evil and more funding in all our social services are needed. Now the validity of these arguments is not important but their different perspectives show us IMO both the differences and overlap between social and economic ideologies.

It is also just as misleading. I mean it's not like 1.2 million people are going to be working in slave conditions. Just one ones they get from Africa it seems. So to claim they're saving lives is quite a stretch to say the least.

I'm looking at a stupid list of 'examples of situational irony' and it has things like ""A pilot had a fear of heights"" - that's not the *exact* opposite, is it - a pilot having a fear of *planes* might be a more polar opposite. But it's still irony because it is generally opposite and contrary to what is expected.

I don't think it has to be an exact opposite (and after all, how can one truly define an exact opposite of a complex situation) - I think it just has to be genrally opposite to what is intended. 

If the intention is 'man goes down to sea in order to dispose of family member and ease family's grieving', and what actually happens is 'man, as a result of this intention, gets washed out to sea and increases family's grieving' - that's opposite enough of what was intended to be called ironic', surely?

A good example of what I was thinking when I referenced Scottish actor being given the lines, is in the US black actors who are forced to play stereotypical characters or are profiled to comic relief characters. Or maybe a southern stand-up comedian making a bunch of hillbilly jokes to pander to an audience with preconceived stereotypes about southern folks. In either of those cases it's common that the actor or comic doesn't really want to be doing it, but it's what sells so they do it anyway.

null,false,ThrowawayForBrewing,null,null,null,"I disagree - man for man, this is a pretty solid squad with flashes of real class (Gil, Benteke, Delph, maybe Sinclair). The problem is with how they are lining up for games, epitomized with the showing at arsenal today. Sanchez can't pass for shit - fine, we know that *so play someone centrally 10yds ahead of him to pick up his passes*. Richardson should have been subbed after 25mins - he was so poor all game and managed to tackle himself to give away the 2nd goal which was beyond baffling. He is good at the back but he's useless running the channels and always ends up miles out position trying to do it, and his crossing is always poor *so use him as a LB, and put Sinclair (you know, the winger we just signed) on ahead of him to link up and make runs and crosses into the box*. Cleverley is so anonymous I thought he'd slipped away early to beat the traffic *so don't start him*. Weimann is so poor on the left it is beyond belief - he is infinitely better as a finisher in the box (all of his goals this season that I can remember have been a result of him being out of position and getting the ball in the middle) *so stop playing him out wide*. This shit isn't hard, nothing has changed for any of these players and the lessons should have been learned 2 seasons ago. I'm not even going to start on the new ""philosophy"" of possession based football as the entire ill conceived notion is laughable. We don't have the players to make the possession count - please God, stop with it. Please.



Ironically I think the back 4 and Sanchez are pretty solid (an assertion borne out by our decent defensive showing, but woeful scoring record/creative ability) but Sanchez needs a partner DM to make the passes forward, and distribute play. I reckon Westwood would do the job nicely, but if anyone has higher passing stats and a high work rate then I imagine they'd slot in too.



Ahead of them, Gil - Delph - Sinclair. Wingers who are pacy, creative, able to create width and put in decent crosses (Delph to boss the centre because he's the captain, and who else do we have to play that role?) and the lone frontman of Benteke to attack any balls in. His holdup play is good enough to play on his own, but he looks completely dejected turning out for this shower every week. I don't blame him - he looks atrocious by association with these jokers. We know he's class because we've seen it - get his morale up by getting him some more chances and goals.



I'd also want Grealish on the bench, to come on and play a few minutes of *every* game to get him ready for next season when he'll be starting.



The frustrating thing is lambert occasionally does some of the above, it works, so he switches back to something that is not even close. The width and crossing isn't going to be electrifying, but it's by far and away the best way to play the current squad and will give us so much more potential going forward. To be honest, could it get any worse?

We're only 5 fucking points from 3rd with 15 games left to play. Anything can fucking happen!

I thought it was because France was bankrupt and the king wanted to take the middle classes wealth from them to pay the nations debt? The ideas only came about when trying to resolve what the right way to manage this is.

When it boils down to it the causes of the French revolution were exactly the same as the causes of the English revolution. It turned out differently because France didn't have the advantage of a sea between it and its enemies. The other major ironic difference is Britain had parliamentary leaders who were pretty uncompromising. They weren't asking for a huge amount but they weren't going to take no for an answer.

Also wholeheartedly agree with Sanchez in front of the back line is solid and we need a creative option in front of him. I don't know how much truth there is to them, but rumors of us being linked with Moussa Dembele had me bouncing off the walls. He doesn't seem to be a big part of Pochettino's plans at spurs, and he is incredibly creative and talented going forward while still able to play a deeper role. I think he would be the perfect fit to our squad. Not to mention he's the type of player with real ability, which as a result would instill confidence and make the players around him better. 
 
Sometimes it seems as if we go into matches without having trained and been tactically prepared whatsoever. I could not agree more with your point about Lambert's inconsistencies in general. 

I wasn't at all trying to say that I think our squad doesn't have the quality to stay up. The confidence is killing us though. as /u/mambocalrissian said I think westwood is our most important player as he always brings passion and fighting spirit into the squad, which I feel like we desperately lack, especially after today.

I lay that entirely at Lambert's door - Villa fans have been patient, and given him time way beyond what he could expect at any other club (managers have been sacked in less time for far better performances) and he is the 4th longest serving manager in the prem, a day behind 3rd if memory serves and that is including Wenger at arsenal - a complete outlier. This is his squad, and his philosophy. The fact that he hasn't worked out who his best XI are, or how to play them, or even what formation works best is entirely his fault and the reason we're sleepwalking into relegation.

Does anyone expect anything except a heavy defeat against Chelsea? Has that changed in the last 4 years? Then what has PL built exactly?

When you look at who we have been linked to...

The Kono link seems to be driven by the papers (and it was the Mail, Metro and Express who covered it) just for the sake of driving a rumour, none of the more reliable sources ever touched on it.

Ings would always be difficult given where Burnley are in the table but if it had an actual chance it would have been earlier so Burnley had a chance to pick up a replacement.

Rabiot was a short term solution to depth and the longer it dragged on the less likely it was to happen.

Delph signed long term to up his value in summer.

Destro and Lacazette were pure paper talk intended to drive views.

Depay and Schneiderlin were carry overs from the summer and are even less likely to happen in January when the price (already prohibitive of us making a move) are going to be even higher.

Tore, Zaza and others seemed more like Agents trying to drive demand.

&gt;The Green Party has long been opposed to nuclear on the basis of safety and the problem of fuel disposal. But I’m prepared to put those to one side - people tend to have very fixed views and aren’t often changed.
There’s also cost issues - but the big one for me is that nuclear is slow to get approval and build: way too slow for the urgency of our energy needs or our need to cut carbon emissions.
Solar energy is taking off and costs are plummeting, there’s exciting developments in tidal power, e.g. starting with the Swansea Bay lagoon proposal that’s part of a scheme set to provide 9% of the UK’s electricity demand via tidal in ten years—and hopefully we’ll soon get serious about energy conservation, which would also tackle fuel poverty.
The nuclear issue was debated at the last Green Party conference (a significant proportion voted to support nuclear power) - and it is worth saying that policy in the Green Party is made by our members - any four members can propose a motion to conference and it will be considered.

I use this on my unlimited plan with no tethering allowance so I know it works.

Simply connect the recipient device to your hotspot and on the recipient device setup a VPN connection - I use the free VPN ""Onavo"" (just be aware Onavo is owned by Facebook and mines all your data and sells it) on my iPad. If for whatever reason this VPN disconnects and you get your data blocked, simply cycle aeroplane mode and your data will come back.

Basically, a VPN encrypts all of the data so Three (or other providers) cannot do Deep Packet Inspection to see if you are tethering. In Three's deep packet inspection they look at the user agent of any http data being used, from this they can deduct which device you are using. If you normally use a Samsung Galaxy S4 and then the next day your user agent appears to be from Windows 7 or an iPad then they can deduct that you are tethering.

I have tried changing the user agent and that doesn't work. Using the VPN on the host device (your phone) doesn't work either as the tethered data doesn't pass through the VPN if you are on a tethered device (this is a feature of iOS/Android to prevent fake hotspots mining peoples data).",null,0,null,1422810415,null,0,1422811142,0,co7tg26,null,t3_2uek8k,null,t1_co7tg26,null,t3_2uek8k,null,null,null,1424271337,null,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1,null

They insisted, and a week later, still not daring to spend any of it I called again as we still hadn't had an award notice, they confirmed it was correct and the paper work was in the post. 
This happened during April a few years back, fast forward to Novemer of the following year I get a letter saying we owe them it back! I was livid, I don't know if it's still the same now, but the dedicated phone number started out with a message that basically said, they expect any and all payments to be paid back promptly, if they say you owe it, you damn well owe it and what the penalty would be if it wasn't paid, that was before you even spoke to a human being.

null,false,Taure,null,null,null,"I think there's a persistent equivocation in this article which is being used as a polemical rhetorical device. This is the equivocation of pragmatism and empiricism with anti-intellectualism. ""Anti-intellectual"" carries all sorts of baggage; it implies a lack of rigour, an embrace of ignorance and irrationality. In associating so-called ""British values"" of pragmatism and empiricism with anti-intellectualism, it implies that they too have these faults.

Yet pragmatism and empiricism are none of these things. It takes a great amount of intellectual resources to accurately describe empirically observed phenomena. It requires rationality, rigour, and an attention to detail. It even requires the construction of general theories. This is true especially of the natural sciences, but it is equally true of politics, which is intrinsically tied up with the economics. The writer himself describes a general political theory elucidated by Burke.

What the article is really getting at is some idea that continental thought is more disposed towards ""theory making"". Given that there is no absence of theories in British political, philosophical and scientific thought, I can only conclude that the writer means to refer to a specific *type* of theory-making that is practised on the continent and not in Britain.

From what is presented, this type would appear to be the type of theory that involves a broad, sweeping ideology, the kind that a single writer comes up with from their armchair, wherein they seek to explain and prescribe huge parts of the world into simple yet imprecise concepts conjured from the writer's own mind. 

In this sense the article merely restates the age-old ""continental vs. analytical"" divide and carries all the problems that come with that artificial divide. But further, I'm not at all sure that armchair idealism is of any greater intellectual rigour than pragmatism. For this reason the article seems to be fundamentally dishonest: the argument presented mainly concerns differing respect for ideology, which does not support at all a conclusion regarding intellectual resources.

For that conclusion the writer would also need to provide an argument that ideology is intellectually superior to pragmatism.",null,0,null,1422810684,null,0,false,0,co7tkuf,null,t3_2uebfo,null,t1_co7tkuf,null,t3_2uebfo,null,null,null,1424271275,null,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8,null

That said, a few people in this thread have played the ""don't push your beliefs on me"" card, which troubles me a little. In instances where beliefs are for the greater good I'd argue they should be forced on us, even if they're unpalatable to some. That's how we advance and better ourselves collectively. They're rather extreme comparisons, but women's suffrage, abolition of capital punishment, legal abortion were all ""forced down our throats"" at one point. And despite considerable resistance at the time I'd argue we're better for it. I don't completely know Morrisey's angle in regards his being anti-meat, but there are credible, sensible arguments for not eating meat. I suspect it's an inevitability that rearing meat for slaughter will one day become unsustainable because of it's inefficiency, it's environmental impact and ever-increasing demand for food. So I can sympathise with his position.

I don't want to probe into your personal matters so I won't. If you need to eat meat for a health matter and you're a devout fan of the music of Steven Morrisey you have the option to eat it before or after the concert or to bring your own. Or you can enjoy his music in an alternative forum. But I don't find the argument against Morrisey asserting his anti-meat views to be particularly credible.

British nuclear weapons exist to ensure Britain can nuke the Soviets in the event of the US bottling out. That is, when the soviet tanks rolled over Germany and France, if the US decided not to go all in but cut a deal, the British (and similarly the French) could force their hand by starting WW3 on their own.

In the event of the US being involved, the numbers are simply silly. Britains missiles don't make a difference.

Of course, things have changed since the 1980s. The USSR disbanded. The UK no longer has effective operational control of its missiles (little details like needing the triggers refilled regularly by the Americans. Not having independent GPS, etc.) The UK ""deterrent"" is a adjunct of the US Navy.

So disband. Claim the moral high ground, but more importantly get some military and diplomatic tools you can actually use. Like not being dependent on Russian oil and gas, for example.

- Barrow was dangerous all game.

- Resilient 2nd half. Remember this has been our weakness all year.

- Defense played as a unit, despite possession Saints had only a couple real chances

- Fabianski brilliant again.

- Shelvey's shooting boots were on

- Flanks looked incredibly weak in the first half

- Heartbreaking injury to Barrow.. Bertrand should be ashamed

The earth is dying, so I kind of want the primary source to not be coal, and quick. Yes, bring in the renewables ASAP to supplement the coal now, and get us using less, but to get us OFF coal, we need nuclear, and the problem is that people think ""Oh we can have renewables INSTEAD of nuclear, and so support for nuclear isn't as high as it would be if people realised ""Oh, no you can't"".

 If the primary is nuclear, then the costs will go up, but if we don't switch the primary to nuclear, then the earth goes tits up.

You're right that that's how GM has been used in the US (except it HAS boosted production, considerably) but the world is bigger than the US, and no selective breeding has produced the drought/pest resistant crops being used in the least stable parts of the world. Used without patent, and without requirements for repeat buys.

* There's lots of women, something like two third to three quarters of the student body are female students. This has pros and cons, but I imagine it depends on your preferences and situation as to whether this is tolerable.

* RH has all of the costs, especially financial, of living in London without the benefits of easy access to the London lifestyle.

* She found it excruciatingly posh. She came from a working class Liverpool Chinese family and went to a local comp, and felt extremely out of place at RH. Long story short, she felt uncomfortable and in her view was made to feel unwelcome by the student body. There was lots and lots of drama, and she really regrets choosing Holloway.

Liverpool University is a good uni, a solid red brick. History and politics are both good courses there. Liverpool itself has a lot of charm and punches above its weight culturally, but you should probably come up for a visit to check the city out just so you know what you're getting into. It's a little gritty, scruffy even, but foreigners I've shown it to think it's clean, so it's not that bad. Cost of living and access to the airport are both great. 

Probably the biggest negative and its biggest positive are the people - they're good craic, really charming and friendly, but also quite insular. The city as a whole nurses a huge chip on its collective shoulder and as a non-Scouser you have to bear in mind that you'll be seen as an outsider, especially at first, and this will affect how people treat you. It's not necessarily negative, but it means you have to be quite considerate, and it's also annoying after you've lived there for years and just not picked up the accent.

This is interesting. For literally years I've been trying to argue the point that legalising drugs won't actually solve the problem and it's the first time I've ever heard anyone actually even half agree.

The worst part is, people like to resort to the ad hominem argument of ""oh you just want to spoil our fun!"" and this is the big issue. It's all fun and games until your liver fails. Ironically enough, I'm not trying to spoil anyone's fun. I'm trying to keep them alive long enough to understand the mistake they're trying to make. By keeping drugs illegal, we're saying to kids ""This stuff is bad"". Legalising them would be like saying ""it's perfectly fine, go ahead"".

Most of the neo-socialists that like to think socialism is about decriminalising everything try to argue the toss that drugs criminalisation=exploitation of drug users by locking up minorities in prisons. I get the point but for me in a country with socialist healthcare it means everybody pays for the awful habits of a few greedy and selfish individuals who don't care who they hurt as long as they get their fix. Those who are vulnerable and take to drugs because of their social situation are even worse off. It simply means that getting a hand on drugs is easier and then the effects of it spiral out of control. Neither do I buy the idea that taxing it makes up enough money. Smokers don't pay enough tax on their cigarettes to warrant the treatment they end up receiving. I'm a leftie so it doesn't bother me *so* much but it irks me that modern socialist kids think that socialism is about ending government oppression when it isn't and in a lot of cases doesn't exist like they think it does anyway. It's about fighting for the community. Where everyone put's their shift in to help everyone rather than just gunning for profit wherever possible.

As far as I'm concerned (as a individual who works in a medical field day in, day out) people will not, and I repeat, will not choose the right course of action when there is a personal gain to be made (financial, emotional or otherwise). If you offer someone the choice between a salad and a burger, 95% of non vegetarians will choose the burger because it tastes nicer. 

Choosing the unethical option has far too much emotional benefit to warrant *giving* people the choice on a number of issues. Drugs is one of them. If drugs are legalised, we're not giving people the choice. It's like giving people the choice between two poison apples and saying it's ok because they have a choice. It's not ok. Choice alone should not be the sole decider of ethics and it's dangerous to think so.

These are emotionally beneficial substances, they fit bill in that sense. Smokers are indicative. Smokers still smoke because of the emotional benefit they get, ignoring the health issues to themselves and other people. Other addictive substances (and in this, I include cannabis. You can argue whether or not it's addictive in the traditional sense but I'd wager any stoner who was told to give up now and never go again wouldn't be able to do it) will be exactly the same.

Now, people argue the difference between decriminalisation and legalisation but it's not the point. Either way, vulnerable people that need protecting now have even easier opportunities to get hold of harmful, destructive substances. The only difference between the two is how easy it is for these people to get hold of them. Dealers will still reap the rewards either way. If legalised, it will be companies instead who profit from people's addiction and that's just a minefield of ethical conundrums.

**Second Edit:** for the records gals and guys, downvoting people actually achieves little. I'm trying to promote discussion either way. Pushing that little downvote button just pisses people off who are doing what reddit intended and is the equivalent of throwing your toys out the pram because someone doesn't agree with you. Save it for people who act like arseholes, shitposts and trolls, not the ones who share their opinion where it is requested somewhat. You can carry on downvoting if that's what you want and it makes you feel better, it doesn't bother me either way.

null,false,MICOTINATE,null,null,null,"Really disappointing. A promising start turned into a terrible performance. There were a lot of similarities between this and our win at Old Trafford except obviously the shoe was on the other foot.

Swansea were compact and organised so credit where it's due they were good all match in that regard.

But first half we had 86% possession at times, and for all that we weren't creating enough chances or testing Swansea nearly enough. For 60 minutes we played walking football, as soon as we reached the final third and a Swansea defender stepped up to pressure the ball *slightly* it would either be passed back to halfway or at our most ambitious played out for the fullbacks to swing in a cross. 

Except the crosses were pointless because the back 4 were never once stretched or out of position. They were largely poor crosses as well, how many times did some tepid ball float comfortably go into Fabianski's arms?

After the first 5 minutes the whole team seemed to have convinced themselves winning was a formality and from that point onward we were complacent and casual. Swansea were on total shit form coming in to this and they were nothing special in midfield but we were so gentle with them for so long they got confident enough to win.

Tadic in particular was guff today, I don't think he once took his man on and telegraphed every pass he made. I would have liked to see him come off to be honest, I still rate him but he was poor today and too many attacks were dying with him. Elia and Davis were good and Mane actually ran at Swansea and caused them bit of trouble when he came on.

On first viewing I didn't think Bertrand did much wrong but from the other closer angles I think it was a deserved red. He's not the psycho leg breaker /r/soccer is painting him to be but he went in stupidly hard which you can only do if you get everything else right. Now we have to go without him for 3 games.

At this point in the season, with the opportunity we've got where we are in the table there's no excuse for the toss we saw today. Way too complacent.

This is because, to me, the Conservative party seems to be the one that has dragged us out of the recession( which may be due to the previous Labour governments' fuckups), and has the most sensible policy in several areas. For example, on immigration and the EU , the Labour policy seems that it would do nothing about the current high immigration rate, and would refuse the British people the option of leaving the EU, which is a popular opinion. UKIP, conversely, would leave the EU in the same way. The conservatives offer a fairer approach.
Also, in terms of party leadership and campaigning.
UKIP suffer from allegations of racism, sexism, and are only really campaigning about one issue. I would, however, support the UKIP policies on other issues, such as grammar schools.
The Lib Dems seem to have sat around doing absolutely nothing, and have fallen out of favour with previous supporters.
Ed Milliband obviously has little support or approval even within his own party, and his campaign so far appears to be to scaremonger about the NHS, and try to attack the Conservatives on other issues( which has failed), and occasionally spout random buzzwords. He has said very little about what changes he would effect if put in power, except to undermine the UKs credibility , as he and his party are hard to take seriously.
The SNP have a huge following, splitting labour, but have much the same problems after the recent oil crisis would have severely damaged an independent Scotland.

null,false,avapoet,null,null,null,"Tether-blocking is usually done in one or more of the following ways:

1. **Phones that grass.** Some phones, especially those using custom firmware provided by the network, will *tell on you* when you tether. Workarounds: don't use computers you don't control, rooting, avoid using cable/Bluetooth tethering (use WiFi).

2. **TTL inspection.** When a network packet is sent, it contains a number which is how many 'hops' it is allowed to travel. If this isn't equal to what would be expected from your phone, or especially if it's one or two hops lower than the common default for major operating systems, this is detected as tethering. Workaround: change the default TTL in your computer to be one higher than the default TTL of your phone to make it undetectable.

3. **MAC addresses.** Despite what you might expect, the hardware address of your WiFi card can be derived from the packets received by the upstream router controlled by your network. This exposes the hardware manufacturer, which in turn identifies that your computer is *not* a phone. Workaround: MAC spoofing.

4. **TCP stack fingerprinting.** Your operating system will give away details of its identity in the way that its TCP stack is configured, e.g. the initial window size, default TTL (as described above), etc. This can be used to detect that you're connecting from e.g. a Windows box. Workarounds: tough, but on a good and open OS you can reconfigure these reasonably well and with some research simulate your phone's packets pretty accurately.

5. **Behaviour observation.** Many operating systems engage in particular behaviours that hint strongly at their identity. When joining wireless networks, they do captive portal detection to work out if the network grants Internet access, for example, which can be detected. Many operating systems phone home in order to get OS updates, which can be detected. These can quickly become clues that you're tethering. Workarounds: use a VPN or a similar encrypted tunnel, or disable these kinds of checks.

6. **Deep packet inspection.** Once you start *using* the Internet, the applications you use (e.g your web browser, your game client, etc.) might identify themselves, and if those applications aren't available on your mobile platform (Chrome for Windows 7 definitely doesn't run on an iPhone, for example!), this gives away that you're tethering. Workarounds: spoof your user agent for web browsing etc. and put up with stupid servers sometimes giving you mobile versions of sites, only use encrypted connections (HTTPS, or run everything over a VPN).

Further workaround options: if most traffic is being blocked but DNS is permitted, work around it using Iodine or similar (incidentally, this is also great for getting free WiFi from badly paywalled captive hotspots); if you're doing this routinely and discover that you need to keep changing settings, build a proxy box out of e.g a Raspberry Pi that does the work for you; tunnelling *via your phone* by e.g. running an SSH client that supports SOCKS tunnelling on your phone bridging your networks, and piping all of your traffic through that, like a poor-man's-VPN.

Note that while none of the things I've described are illegal, they may make it possible to accidentally or deliberately violate the terms of your agreement with your network, so consider this first. Furthermore, some of the techniques described *are* the same ones that *can* be used in illegal ways (i.e. against the Computer Misuse Act, among others) so if you're going to experiment, familiarise yourself with the law first to make sure you stay on the right side of it.

I've not given you the answer, because I don't know it. However, I've given you the information you'd need to start investigating and to *find* the answer, no matter what it is.

null,false,kingofthejaffacakes,uk,United Kingdom,null,"Can we stop with the ""poverty gap"" stuff.  Relative measures are daft; and quoting them rather than more sensible, absolute measures, potentially hides real poverty problems.

Imagine everyone (say 100 people) on your street earned £30,000 a year.

 - Poverty gap increase: 99 people continue to earn the same (and so are no poorer) and 1 person wins the lottery.
 - Poverty gap increase: 100 people lose earnings, but one person loses 1%, and everyone else loses 10% of their wage.
 - Poverty gap increase: 99 people earn 10% more; one person earns 20% more.

Only one of these would be an increase in absolute poverty; i.e. not a ""well if someone else has more, I should have more mentality""; i.e. you can buy as much stuff (or more) than you could before; i.e. people were not poorer.   You can do worse though: what if 1 person on this street earns £50,000?  Government can decrease the poverty gap by taking £20,000 off him -- just stealing it; now nobody is any better off, and one guy has been stolen from.  And if that's what you want -- why would it matter if government did it?  Why not just start stealing from rich people?

The ""gap"" between rich and poor is not what government should be focusing on, and when we allow them to use that as the metric, we have no idea if things are getting better.

Well ideally but I'm just a killjoy after all /s

No I understand that there are levels of drugs some are more harmful than others and in the grand scheme of things tobacco does nothing but calm you down and alcohol fucks with your mental state for a bit. Of course long term effects are far different, I don't think it's OK to alter your brain either way but I can't stop people making that choice I just choose not to do it to myself and carry on. Let's face it, drugs take you from a normal position and fling you into the abnormal. Legal drugs take you from the abnormal and skew you back in the right direction. It's almost exclusively the only difference and even then, illegals used right can help and legals used wrong can hinder.

I understand your point and agree mostly. Unfortunately I find it difficult to leave people on a self destructive path. I can't overtly save them and I know it but I'd like to try for conscience sake if nothing else.

So you won't get a record if you are caught with some weed, but you'll still be buying weed from the dodgy guy down the road - and he'll still be cutting it with glass or sand or whatever.

So the drugs stay dangerous and the trade continues to funnel money into the hands of violent criminal organisations but it reduces the risk on the part of the user which _could_ increase the number of users or the volume they purchase thus making the criminals more money and increasing their power.

It is an insane policy that people only support because they are too scared to support legalisation despite it being eminently more sensible. 

Drug policy is like the [Caudine Forks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Caudine_Forks#Description):

&gt;When Herennius arrived he explained that were they to set the Romans free without harm, they would gain the Romans' friendship. If they killed the entire Roman army, then Rome would be so weakened that they would not pose a threat for many generations. At this his son asked was there not a middle way. Herennius insisted that any middle way would be utter folly and would leave the Romans smarting for revenge without weakening them.

There is no Middle Way - you either completely legalise it or you completely prohibit it and mercilessly crackdown on the trade.

null,false,phob87,lfc68,,null,"Another superb performance. There were obvious headlines after the game, but the fact that this effort hasn't receive as much attention is a real testament to how his consistency has improved.

Take a look at his improvement over the past 3 seasons (*keeping in mind we are about 2/3 of the way through this season):

Season | Beg. Age | Apps | Goals
------|-----|----|-----
2012 - 2013 | 17 | 24 | 2
2013 - 2014 | 18 | 33 | 10
2014 - 2015* | 19 | 22 | 8

Further, what I think these numbers don't show is how much more he's matured as a footballer.  He went from a winger his first season, to a more central, playmaking role much of last season, and has spent most of this season playing as a target man up front (more of an out-and-out striker). Each time, he has adapted to the role and has produced terrific performances. If we're being harsh, I think his decision making in the final third has been his biggest ""weakness"", but even that seems to be improving regularly. Take for example his performance yesterday and the chances he created (setting up Hendo for a good opportunity right inside the box, putting Coutinho through off a brilliant back-heel, making Reid look silly and crossing a perfectly weighted ball to Moreno, etc.).

And of course, BR deserves a lot of credit for managing his development so well these past few seasons. We've got a truly unique, young talent on our hands, and I think the sky's the limit for him. Sturridge being back will only free him up more, and I have a feeling we're in for a treat the remainder of the season.",null,0,null,1422817045,null,0,false,0,co7wxik,null,t3_2uecul,null,t1_co7wxik,null,t3_2uecul,null,null,null,1424269712,null,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null

Thursdays we would go in to observe some of the chinese teachers having a class, just so we could see the way they teach English as native Chinese speakers, then one day a week you have 3 40 minute classes, normally in the afternoon/evening. I was in two minds before I came home whether or not if this was something I wanted to carry on with, but looking back on it, it was one of the most rewarding and enjoyable things I've done in my life. 

The lesson structure is up to you, but the Chinese teachers give you lessons plans reviewing content they have covered, and things they would like you to expand upon in your lessons. My usual structure was go over the lesson plan content for 30 minutes, then play games they utilise the words and phrases you've taught them. 

I went in the Winter, and it was absolutely bloody freezing. In the Spring, Summer and Autumn, the weather is much better though, or that's what I was told by people who have been there for a couple of years.

This is a little tricky but there are a few things going on here:

1. Returns on stocks have historically, over the long term, done well. The S&amp;P500 has averaged over 10%/year over the last 40 years. 50% in 5 years is equivalent to an 8.5% annual return. The S&amp;P500 has averaged a 14% return over the last 5 years, so a 100% growth in 5 years.
2. The last 5 years are basically after a big drop, the 10 year return for the S&amp;P500 is 7.6%.
3. Often the funds you see are all successful awesome ones, that's because they kill off the ones that have done badly. This is equivalent to the hindsight bias. 

&gt; Why don't people just buy then because they seem to go back up eventually

Depending on quite what you mean, a lot of people do.

You shouldn't wait for it to crash, because you never know when it'll happen or what it'll drop to.

But lots of people either buy a bit more when things drop in price or continue to invest steadily. 

Not everyone can though, and those people will lose out. People drawing a pension don't have more money to put in, they're taking money out.

null,false,Amckinstry,null,null,null,"I disagree, from working with the renewables industry (wind and wave, but also on the energy grid front, at a European level). 

The batteries i'm talking of are car batteries: EV, assuming the type Tesla are currently building, on the scale of that. These are nominally in a car, for driving it, but in practice store ~ 50-100 kWh power each. With effective energy saving/reduction, thats 3-4 days power per household, sitting beside the house. This dramatically changes the storage / demand equation, and many grid companies have been designing around this, as they have to ; they work decades in advance.

Secondly, wind, wave, solar are predictable on a ~few day timescale. A lot of work goes into the smart-grid to balance the demand around this: when that kind of storage is involved (+ hydro in Norway, demand-changing consumption on concrete, Aluminium, etc.). On this scale, the shift to renewables-primary _is_ working; Here in Ireland wind is currently providing ~40% electricity this time of year. This is limited by the grid's desire for reactive balance and a lack of interconnects; with more interconnects wind+wave can provide &gt; x10 the energy we need (in winter Denmarks wind is now providing ~100% of electricity as it has good interconnects with Germany).
In the UK my understanding is the lack of deployed renewables makes nuclear urgent (I think they were suckered into it by lobbying by the nuclear industry, especially negative lobbying against wind that made nuclear the only option). And France has made a strategic decision in favour of nuclear, but don't underestimate the scale of changes underneath: the solar revolution, smart grid are bigger deals than many people realise. Nuclear can't compete with solar on price in Ireland or UK, but the energy companies will fight rooftop solar for obvious reasons.

We were having a *great* season up until Christmas. Since then we have been playing like shit, for a couple of reasons, not the least of which is Sam's insistence on going with Nolan and his very questionable formations that have done a 180 from the stretch where we were unstoppable.

But one thing I have noticed in the Premier League. Everyone is so entrenched in a system that severely lacks parity. This has a far-reaching effect. Even though we've made some incredible acquisitions and we have a very different lineup than we did even last season, we still believe that we are that same lowly team fighting to stay out of relegation. We feel *lucky* to have made it to 4th in the table. And as you said, we never expected to stay there. I'm sure this belief is held by the players too. Conversely, when Manchester United were struggling in the middle of the table, they felt like ""we're not *supposed* to be here.""

I think that this train of thought is crap. We have a good team...perhaps even a *great* team. And yet we don't aspire to win the league? We don't aspire to the Champions League? Why the fuck not? Because history says we can't? Well, history doesn't say that. It says we haven't, not that we can't. Look at Southampton. We could be where Southampton is had a couple of matches played out differently, if we didn't have certain injuries, if Sam didn't put Kevin FUCKING Nolan in the middle of the pitch to shit all over the spirit of the team.

We are not that different from Southampton in a lot of respects. Hell, they have a more dire recent history than we do! We could very well be up there, fighting with and against them for a spot in Europe. But for some reason, we are all too jaded to believe we can do it.

Make pretty much any software at work and it'll be caught, at home is questionable - the more different the better, but there are no guarantees by any means.

A software engineer painting a picture at home is easy to answer, even though they are both protected by copyright. But there will always be a risk of you are doing the same kind of thing at home as at work. 

Not only is this a common clause in a contract, it simply mirrors the law. Deleting it from the contract would make little difference as the law would just step in. They would have to do something like expressly exclude the law in the contract - which they would never do.

&gt;

&gt;__Derby__ (^i/ˈdɑrbi/ *__DAR__-bi*) is a [city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_status_in_the_United_Kingdom) and [unitary authority area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_authorities_of_England) in the [East Midlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Midlands) region of England. It lies upon the banks of the [River Derwent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Derwent,_Derbyshire) and is located in the south of the [county](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceremonial_counties_of_England) of [Derbyshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derbyshire), of which it is traditionally the [county town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_town). In the 2011 census, the city had a population of 248,700 and 1,543,000 in the wider metro area.

&gt;As home to [Lombe's Mill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombe%27s_Mill), the first factory in the world, Derby is considered a birthplace of the [Industrial Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution). With the arrival of the railways in the 19th century, and due to its strategic central location, the city grew to become a foremost centre of the British rail industry.

&gt;Today, Derby is an internationally renowned centre for advanced transport manufacturing, home to the world’s second largest aero-engine manufacturer, [Rolls-Royce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolls-Royce_Group_PLC), and [Derby Litchurch Lane Works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derby_Litchurch_Lane_Works)—the UK's only remaining train manufacturer. The [Toyota Manufacturing UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Manufacturing_UK)'s automobile headquarters is found just South of the city at Burnaston.

When teaching topics, for so many students not knowing their times tables is want prevents them from moving on. For example, division (with whole number solutions) is very easy if you know your times tables. Anyone who knows their times tables will be able to know instantly that 56÷7=8 because 7x8=56.

I'm teaching adding fractions to a middle ability class at the moment and the students who don't know their times tables are so uncomfortable with finding the lowest common multiple between two numbers that they get completely lost from the start. Again, by knowing your times tables off by heart students don't become overwhelmed with the numerical process and can concentrate on grasping concepts. 

While you say you didn't learn your times tables off by heart, I would assume you used 'tricks' to get the answers very quickly - which is fine too.

null,false,vzzzbux,eng-Cornwall,Cornwall,null,"&gt; Nonsense. The BBC and other so-called terrestrial channels completely underpin the Sky platform. Without them the service would not be viable as even on that platform they are still the most watched channels overall, and by some considerable margin. 

Again, Sky managed 10-15 years without the BBC or any terrestrial channels. Quite successfully.

In addition, Sky paying the BBC would go against any established practice. Sky pays channels to become Sky exclusive, or at the very least, a subscription service. The BBC obviously cannot do either of these.

People join Sky to watch the paid-for channels. They do not join to get a TV recorder for primarily BBC content. They join for something that adds onto the free channels. The BBC is on Sky because they have to be - if they weren't, they'd be called into question for not being made available on as many platforms as possible.

I'd imagine that 10 million TV licences more than pay for the trivial costs of being on Sky's guide, and that Sky-using BBC viewers actually subsidise Freeview and Freesat users.

&gt; Sky sell their subscriptions on the strength of carrying those major channels. It would be a major inconvenience for their subscribers, but not having them on Sky would not stop them from getting them by other means such as Freeview or Freesat. Plus the number of subscribers they have now can be largely attributed to that content being available. I mean, would you have signed up to Sky if the major channels weren't carried?

They sell their service on the strength of the paid for channels, primarily. Go to Sky's site. See how many mentions of the BBC vs how many mentions of Sky Atlantic, Sky Sports or some other Sky channel.

It's a convenience that the BBC are also on the same platform. It's not a necessity as far as Sky are concerned.

Yes, I would have signed up for Sky anyway. I'd also have wondered why the BBC cannot pay a trivial fee (£4+ billion budget) to make itself available to the largest single group of viewers.

It's stupid to say that people would use other platforms anyway. We have moved into an era where people want everything on one box, and being forced to buy a Freesat or Freeview box/aerial to watch content that they are *forced* to pay for because the BBC won't pay a tiny fee is just ridiculous.

&gt; Seriously, the content those channels provide is immensely valuable to Sky and so the dropping of this so-called 'retransmission fee' is long overdue. 

Sky does not make money from the BBC's availability. You do not need to pay Sky to watch the BBC through their equipment. The BBC would seriously come off of this far worse. That is probably why they haven't acted in a petty manner and simply refused to pay, but they have made savings where they can and have been supportive of any move to reduce or remove those fees.

Personally I think the BBC should at least pay whatever Sky's actual costs are in making the BBC available, rather than £0 or £10 million+ (which is a rather obscene amount). I'd bet the real costs are in the thousands or tens of thousands",null,0,null,1422821337,null,0,false,0,co7z9qr,null,t3_2ub1nd,null,t1_co7z9qr,null,t1_co7ypx9,null,null,null,1424268559,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Asked about plans to ban animal experimentation and the problem this creates for researchers, her answer? She cares about animals &amp; intra-party democracy. A non-sequitur if ever there was one.

Asked about how she will fund the UBI, her answer? Wait and see.

Asked about GMOs, when they have been considered safe by the scientific community for quite a while now, her answer? We gotta make sure they're safe. (??)

Asked about nuclear and the unfeasibility of focusing solely on wind/solar, her answer? Absolutely nothing specific, because that would undermine her case, but that somehow ""nuclear is slow to get approval and build"". Gee I wonder why that is Mrs Green Party. I won't go into details why Solar isn't the saviour because there's plenty of posts on reddit about it already (or academic papers, if you can access them).

Asked about why some of her policies are sexist showing a focus on women's needs, her answer? They apply to *men* too, you see, but actually women have it so bad, that's why it was drafted like that. Never mind what that implies she thinks of men.

Fair enough, she didn't draft these all herself because as she says the party overall decides on what policies to pursue. But what does that tell you about the Green Party?

This is not a party of the left as the Guardian mentioned recentky:

[""The Greens, on the other hand, having grown out of the environmental movement, seem utterly incoherent. They offer the biggest of big-state polices with huge intervention in some areas, without specifying the role of the state except as a series of committees. Anti-austerity measures have to mean taking on corporations and vested interests. This requires really hard thinking, not musing about allotments and self-reliance. One of their key ideas – that of a Citizen’s Income for everyone whether they work or not – falls to pieces when properly examined.

&gt;Had a think about these scumbags who are attacking the elderly in their own homes.

How often is this happening? Has there been a rise in this type of crime recently? Where are you getting your information?

I've saw a few news stories about this sort of thing happening in England. is this where you have pulled tis from? They don't have paramilitaries in England, so that would make your post redundant. 

&gt;If the police can't get them

The police are usually very good at catching home invaders; It's very hard to get away with. 

How do you know the police are not catching them? Maybe they caught them 2 days after the news story was put up, they don't unless announce it as breaking news when a criminal is caught, except maybe for murder but even then, usually not.

&gt;are there not still paramilitaries in these communities who could dole out some justice. 

Some communities are under a certain amount of 'control' by paramilitaries, the vast majority are not. Are these attacks happening in communities where paramilitaries command a lot of influence. I mean, if I was a granny beater, i'd probably drive an extra 5 mins to get to an estate without armed vigilantes.

&gt;RAAD can attack 'drug dealers,' but where are they when fuckers like that need a talking to?

'Republican Action Against Drugs' focus on drug dealers. Shocker. How are they meant to do anything? Do you want them to post a man in a balaclava outside the home of every pensioner? They don't have a god damn forensic crime lab to examine DNA evidence and finger prints.

Seriously, it's not like home invaders are going to leave their houses and attack someone 5 doors down, then go to the pub and brag about it. Paramilitaries are not going to find out unless someone tells them.

If the police with all their manpower, money and equitment cannot (as you say) find these people, then how are a bunch of postmen, accountants and farmers who dress up in balaclavas going to find them? They couldn't even access CCTV footage or ask pawn shops for inventory. I mean, I could hop in my car, drive to the next town over, invade a home, beat up an old person, take all their stuff, then drive home and nobody would ever know (except probably the police as they are good at finding that sort of thing out for some reason)

&gt;Unless of course, the scumbags attacking the elderly are or know those paramilitaries...

Now you're just throwing out baseless accusations against our hard working paramilitaries. Why would the paramilitaries support randomly beating elderly people? Surely on the list of things that paramilitaries do not like, this would be pretty high on the list? Are you suggesting that paramilitaries are in fact protecting people who beat up the elderly for the £25 in their pockets? 

I can't see them making any sort of significant profit on the racket.

&gt;What ye think?

I think vigilante justice is wrong. What if I choose to accuse my childhood enemy 'Stabby Joe' of beating up the elderly, just because I wanted to see him get hurt? The IRA/UVF will probably take my word for it and place blame on 'Stabby Joe' whilst letting the real criminal away with it.

There are a thousand other reasons why vigilante justice is immoral, unfair and terribly unpractical. Whilst you don't specifically call for it, you are clearly advocating that we should grab our torches and pitchforks and attack hunt down the granny beaters.

Well in classic who and this is considered classic who. The sonic screwdriver was being used too much as a writers convenience. Any problem being solved by it. So they were told not to use it or use it much less. The movie likely followed this rule.

Paul Mcgann is the one saving grace of the movie. It was filled with 90's twists and just wasn't generally very good.

That being said I can't hate it. Paul Mcgann just was a great doctor and I feel like he pulls the movie out from being totally bad to being half okay. I tend to recommend the movie solely for him with the warning that over all it's not very good.

&gt;the doctor just didn't seem like the doctor. 

Well this is one thing I do disagree. Once the doctor regains his memories he takes control of the situation and things are resolved. He was very much the doctor in my opinion.

There are some answers to your questions, but most involve speculation and fan theories.

1) Technically, Seven died on the operating table because the surgeons didn't count on his body being constructed differently than a human's and so they accidentally killed him.  It's a bit more exciting than getting shot by a few stray bullets, but still a bit less grand and heroic than most other incarnations.

2) The goopy ghost snake thing is generally looked upon as one of the movie's low points, but there may be an explanation.  [Classic Series (specifically Keeper of Traken) Spoilers](#s ""In the Keeper of Traken serial the Master became the Keeper of Traken and gained incredible powers for which there is no known limit as a result."")  But that's going out on a limb a bit.

3) There are all sorts of theories about this one that just get more and more bizarre as they go.  I seem to remember the writers recently explaining it off as a joke, although I may be wrong.  I'm pretty sure the reason that the comment was included in the first place was that Fox thought the movie (and potential TV show) might sell better if the protagonist was more relatable to humans, so they tried to make him half-human.

I hope these answers put your minds at ease.  Honestly they're the only things that have enabled me to put up with rewatching the movie, which I've had to do a few times.  On the bright side, the film did introduce the Eighth Doctor, whom I initially disliked due to the movie, but I found he improved a great deal when he worked with different writers.  If you're caught up on the New Series (or have at least completed Series 7), I suggest watching The Night of the Doctor.  It's a mini-episode in which the Eighth Doctor shines.

As a side note, the movie was so unpopular that Paul McGann didn't want to attend conventions for several years after it came out.  When he did eventually go to one, he found that the Big Finish Audio Adventures had improved his popularity so much that he was one of the most popular Doctors there.

The only time he was unhappy with that was just before Mancini left, when he was only ever a super sub. Pellegrini has a better rotation policy and he's happy because he knows he'll get runs like the end of last season where he played the last 10 games (and scored 9).
