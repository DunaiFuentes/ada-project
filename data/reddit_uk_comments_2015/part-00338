null,null,Hemmers,null,null,null,"&gt;That's still 40% of gun crime that could be reduced though.

You mean 40% of gunshot deaths?

Well, yes and no, because homicides are not always murder. There are such things as justifiable homicide and self-defence.

Moreover, one needs to consider the fact that of those 40% of gunshot-deaths that are homicides, not all of them will involve legally-held firearms.

In the UK in 1997 for instance, legally-held firearms were only involved in 1% of firearms crime. When they banned the private ownership of pistols, firearms crime didn't even slightly dip, because it was already reliant on black-market firearms.

So if say, 50% of firearm-homicides involve illegal firearms, then legislation can *at most* limit the 20% of deaths that are homicides involving legally-held firearms.

A new bit of paper in Congress won't do squat about drug runners, cartels or organised gangs. The only way to address that is via *enforcement*.

And this is what happened in the UK. Firearms crime rose prior to 1997, and it continued to rise past 1997. It didn't start to drop until 2004/05 when major guns-and-gangs enforcement (Operations Trident and Trafaglar) started to bite - they (and their predecessors) were launched around 2002/03, and after a couple of years, they'd taken enough guns out the black market and jailed enough gangbangers that gun crime really started to dip.

I have no idea what the ratio of firearm-homicides commited with legal/illegal firearms is (I'm sure the FBI have some numbers available for anyone that wants to dig), but the key thing is that once you break down the ""gun death"" figure, it becomes very rapidly apparent that the notion of simply dealing with this via legislation is an utter nonsense.

Yeah, there may be places where it is appropriate to introduce specific legislation to deal with specific issues, but once you accept that legislation has *already failed* to deal with the illegal guns (which require enforcement), and that suicides can only be partly curtailed by limiting access to firearms, it becomes apparent that introducing legislation without *also* introducing and funding a raft of supporting mental health, public health and law enforcement programmes is nothing more than a cheap, media-friendly - but ultimately hollow - vote winner.

""Hey, look at me, gun control, tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime"".

Yes yes, very impressive. That was the absolutely minimum-effort easy bit - writing something on a bit of paper and voting on it. Now *enforce* it. And enforce the *other* existing laws. And deal with the *root causes* of *both* firearm and non-firearm related suicide.

A large proportion of these EU immigrants come here originally without work, which are precisely those that are targeted by Theresa May in the article, but still manage to pay more in tax by the time they retire.  They are more likely to find work and work harder than the rest of us so why exactly should they be scrutinised more than anyone else?

Lets just cut the bullshit for a second:

1) They pay 30% more in taxes than they receive in benefits
2) A much small proportion of them 'scrounge' when compared to natives
3) This is all despite the fact that it is harder for them to find work before getting here than it would be for a native

null,null,Everton_11,crest,The Lukaku Strikes Back,null,"Current state: 

On the talent level of our first-string, we're probably the sixth or seventh most talented team. Our biggest problem is a lack of quality second stringers who can come in for a game to give the first string a rest.

Our best players are:

Phil Jagielka, affectionately referred to as Jags, our captain, and a central defender who has made over 35 appearances for England.

John Stones, a young, talented central defender who has recently been at the center of a massive, summer-long transfer saga, involving Chelsea.

Leighton Baines, while currently injured, on his day is one of the five best left-backs in the world, an attacking force, both from open play and set-pieces, and we miss him quite a lot when he's gone.

James McCarthy is our man in the middle. Tenacious, hard-charging, no-nonsense defensive midfielder who doesn't shy away from a tackle, and keeps the play running.

Ross Barkley, our attacking midfielder, is one of England's brightest talents. Incredibly skillful with a ball at his feet, running at the opposition, he needs to work on looking to pass the ball more, but on his day is capable of the absolutely sublime and world-class.

Romelu Lukaku, who you may recall for having scored the winner against the USA last summer is an extremely talented, yet frustrating talent as a striker. Lethal with the finish, he sometimes appears to have feet of lead, and is sometimes incapable of controlling the simplest pass.

Prospects:

Ryan Ledson is an 18 year old central midfielder with bags of potential, hasn't made the true first team breakthrough yet, but it's only a matter of time.

Mason Holgate is another young central defnder, signed from the same club as Stones, and if he's even half as good as Stones, has the makings of a very solid defender.

Kieran Dowell is a 17 year old winger who we've seen glimpses of in preseason and u-21s competition and looks to also have a very bright future.

Management;

We finished 11th last year, which was unacceptable. However, there are several reasons this occured, not limited to: we had a squad that was too small to properly cope with the demands of European football, had significant issues with refereeing, were decimated by injuries, players suffered from severe world cup hangovers had slow starts, and many more besides. This is a make-or-break year for Martinez, and as long as he finishes in the top 7, this is acceptable, given the talent of our squad.


Ownership:

Everton's chairman is a lifelong Everton fan by the name of Bill kenwright, who made his money producing plays on the West End in London. However, the amount of money he made is not enough to permit him to personally invest significantly in players transfers, new stadiums, and the like. The only two options for cash injections into the club are either loans, or outside private investment, most likely from selling the club. As a lifelong Evertonian, Kenwright is reluctant to sell the club to an owner who will not respect the traditions and fans of the club he has loved for over sixty years. I find this extremely admirable, and it should be noted that for every Chelsea or Manchester City takeover that occurs successfully, there are just as many other clubs that are ruined by takeovers, Portsmouth and Blackpool being notable examples.

In particular, the board have, according to detractors, failed to reinvest money obtained from selling players to other clubs, most notably Mikel Arteta (Hang around the sub long enough and you'll eventually see something like ""Where's the Arteta money, Bill?').  

The anger has really gone up this year in response to our poor finish, our ""losing out"" on transfer target due to a ""refusal to open the checkbook"", the rising transfer fees offered by clubs generally viewed to be smaller than Everton and several other reasons. However, many of these players we ""lost out"" on, notably Xherdan Shaqiri went to teams where they would be guaranteed to be a centerpiece, which given our squad talent level, we could not offer.

The board has also been accused of failing to capitalize on commercial opportunities, highlighted by a merchandise deal that gives us a guaranteed flat fee instead of a percentage of revenues.

Personally, while I agree there are things the board could do better, I am of the opinion that they are working to lessen the debt of the club as best they can, and provide a solid financial footing for the club to be able to spend competitively in the near future.

It should be noted that the money being thrown around by other premier league teams viewed to be smaller than Everton is not actually in their hands yet, as the new TV deal doesn't kick in until 2016. This is a club that tries not to spend money it doesn't have, which is sound business sense, in my opinion.

All of that being said, you'll need to make up your own mind on the board, the squad, and what you expect from the club.

Welcome to the family, friend. You'll never leave it again. I've found no team, even my first love, the Minnesota Twins, who can tug on my heart like this club.  It really is the People's Club.

A lending corporation provides advances on television revenues to at least two Premier League clubs, one of which is Everton (the other is West Ham).  The officers of the lending corporation do not provide the funding.  Instead, it is provided by one of the wealthiest people in the UK.  That person is also an associate of Bill Kenwright.

And?  That is yawn-worthy stuff.  The fact that the lending corporation's value is small is unexceptional (it looks like this is an investment vehicle for exactly these types of loans to football clubs, which will yield relatively small revenue year-over-year.  Also, there's no reason to retain the value in the investment vehicle itself).  So too is the fact that the officers of the corporation aren't the ones providing the funding.

And for all that, the big conspiratorial payoff doesn't even make sense.  The profit from a sale would be an order of magnitude greater than the profits from these loans, even extended over 16 years, even assuming this has even been the arrangement for 16 years, and even assuming that somehow every dime of profit somehow got rerouted to Kenwright.  There are much, much simpler and more lucrative ways to draw money out of a football club; just look at Blackpool.

A few words of what I'm sure is unwanted advice:  The anti-board folks are spending a lot of time jumping from their own shadows.  I'm sympathetic to some of their arguments but a lot of what these guys are throwing out there is a combination of economically illiterate (the Watched Toffee has no idea how double-entry accounting works, as is obvious from his retweeting of a person asking how a corporation worth $13 million can make a $20 million loan) and irrelevant (did you know that lending officers sometimes don't front money themselves?!?!  It's true!)  And even when there's a good point mixed in, it's surrounded by a lot of nonsense.

I agree with you there, in that if someone wants to dish out punishment, death is a counter-intuitive option, as it's merciful; it's a merciful deterrent, as opposed to a punishment for something deserving worse. (Let's assume we agree on something worse though.)

Also, on a side note, make the distinction between paedophiles and child molesters. There's nothing inherently wrong about paedophilia, as opposed to inherently right.

It was then used in the Piper Alpha disaster, Hungerford, Lockerby and even the Brixton Riots and Aintree in '97. It goes to show that even when innocently used, such systems *are* used for means other than those used to introduce them.

If I needed to work in he city and needed to buy, I would look further afield...namely the west country.

That might sound crazy, but with the electrification of the great western line happening, you will get from the Wiltshire Cotswold's in Chippenham, where a three bed house will cost less then a London bedsit, to Paddington station in around 50 minutes. You then have good schools around, and a nice semi rural life to enjoy over the weekend. Knock off work at 5pm, get back home around 6.30 to 7.00 pm. 

People are starting to latch onto this. They have taken delivery of five Hitachi bullet style trains, all with much more leg room and WiFi that will reach London far quicker then the current surrounding South East based commute lines just outside London.

Also keep in mind automated vehicles making commute times much more predicable in the coming future. 

Looking ahead can get you into a good spot and the west country is going to boom.

If your high-priced guys aren't earning their keep, why continue to throw good money after bad?

Think of it less as ""who's better: Lamela or Townsend?"" and more of ""are we getting our money's worth for the wage space this player is occupying?""  

Even if you rate Lamela higher, do you rate him twice as valuable as Townsend? I don't know their precise wages, but I'll bet Coco makes at least twice what Townsend makes. 

Now that Son is here, presumably he's the high-wage winger. Thus, Lamela is surplus to requirements, EVEN IF you rate Lamela ahead of Townsend. Spurs are not a club who can put millions of pounds a year on the bench to rot. (Notwithstanding paying both Ade and Bobby S a lot last go-round for not much in the way of results.

Barring injury, I think breaking into the top 4 isn't as crazy as it sounds.   To me, it comes down to a couple of reasons.

1) We don't have Europe to worry about like everyone else that will be contending. The EPL as the primary focus will help our fitness, form, and consistency.
2) Our chemistry appears far better then a lot of the traditional contenders.  I think patience to grow a core group slowly over a couple of seasons (Ki, Shevely, Sigurdsson, Gomis, Williams, Taylor) is starting to pay dividends  The fact that we don't gut our entire squad each year is playing in our favor. I actually think City  set themselves up similarly -  with only a couple big names coming in each season but not overhauling the roster.
3) Monk. Enough said.

I don't want my hopes dashed like the rest of you, but I can't deny the fact that we look like a top 4 squad after the first few weeks.

The fact that UK homeowners don't understand that the housing market **is** a speculative market is why it's so dangerous.

Most homeowners' biggest investments are the houses they own. Modern portfolio theory (a basic concept in finance) shows that investors will increase returns and simultaneously decrease the risks they take by diversifying their investments - between bonds, equities, cash, property, etc, and between investments in the UK, Europe, America, Asia, etc.

However, UK homeowners put the vast chunk of their savings not just into *one asset class* (property), but into *one asset* (their house), which is coincidentally located in not just the same *country* but the same *town* where they live and work. Meaning: if the economy in that area goes tits up, then the value of that homeowner's biggest investment collapses **and** the probability of that homeowner losing his or her job shoots up at exactly the same time. That's not a good thing.

Basically, if you actually think seriously about the housing market as a financial investment market, the middle-class homeowner culture we have really doesn't seem like a very smart thing.",null,0,null,1441056392,null,null,false,0,cumacxg,null,t3_3j2kka,null,null,null,t1_culpw7t,null,null,null,1441613989,null,19,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,19,null

Everyone knows Lukaku is a physical specimen, the combination of speed, size, and power is hard to find. He's built like a NFL linebacker but plays as a striker. When he gets a full head of steam and is running at the defenders it's got to be terrifying for them. 

The impressive part about Lukaku in this game was the improvement in his first touch (**he had a turn and spin move on his second goal that I didn't see last year**), his ability to be play a hold-up style of play when the team needed it (usually with long passes delivered to Lukaku where he would box out the defender and hold onto the ball up front until help arrived dispersing balls to Coleman, Kone and Barkley and his deft passing touch ([as seen in the soft pass to Coleman that led to the Barkley goa](http://streamable.com/bjv8?t=10.0)l). You did not see that deft nuance and touch last year. Finally, it was great to see him pressing and pressuring the other team to get the ball, which shows that he's playing a more complete game. Last year there were times when he would get frustrated when he didn't get enough ""service"" on offense and selfishly really didn't do much on defense. In this game that second goal came entirely from Lukaku pressuring the opponent until they turned it over ([Link to play](http://streamable.com/zvnt?t=4.1)) 

The key with Lukaku (and this applies to all our young players) is consistency. Lukaku shows flashes like in the Southampton game, and then disappears for a block of games before he flashes again. I think as the Southampton game shows, he's capable of a more well-rounded game that includes link-up and hold-up play and some forward pressing. It's just a matter of consistently putting up the effort and results.

Last year was a trying year for Lukaku personally ([father's ill health, World Cup hang over, and close friend Junior Malanda's tragic death](http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/romelu-lukaku-how-injuries-fathers-5161586)), this year we'll see more of Lukaku harnessing his vast potential.

Do you *honestly* believe that we can keep up and compete with Manchester United, Chelsea &amp; City now that FFP rules have been relaxed even with a different manager? Even if we made progress, even if we made it to January with a new manager in the mix for a top four, the richer teams have the ability to bring in a game-changer. We don't.  

Anthony Martial has 73 appearances for Monaco and 15 goals. He's 19 years old and United have just bought him for a reported £36million. Raheem Sterling, as we know, just went to City for £49million at the age of 20. Chelsea have bought and sold Salah, Cuarardo, Schurrle &amp; Mata in recent years **all of which** would currently walk into our first team.

Realistically, how do you suppose as a club we keep up with that? How is *any* manager supposed to be able to bring in the players he needs while balancing the books with the people who own the club to make sure we don't end up how we did in 2010 from our desperation to get back in the CL?

null,null,dict_disc,null,null,null,"Generally you should always hold a combination of market portfolio (aka tangent portfolio) and risk-free asset. When you want less risk, you just increase the proportion of risk-free asset (i.e. savings account etc.). This is because Capital Market Line is superior to Efficient Frontier (see [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_asset_pricing_model#Efficient_frontier)).  

So you should just sell a bit (or a large chunk, or whatever) of your current portfolio, rather than changing the asset allocation (although your current portfolio is a bit overweight on equity compared to the market portfolio). Also ideally, you should sell gradually (dollar cost averaging) to avoid getting screwed by volatility. If I were you, I'd sell every month for several months to a year so that I end up with mostly cash when I buy. Note also there's nothing wrong with being leveraged through mortgage (borrow money at low interest and leave money in risk assets) if it makes sense to you.

Tories get boundary changes, EU boil lanced, a nice long period to hand over power, trident renewed, and no one realistically opposing them on the right of centre ground (UKIP's raison d'être having been sorted, or patronised by the next Tory leader). Add into this the fact that they can now plausibly claim that the polls are systematically underestimating them and that they will get a late boost like '92 and '15, and that any prospective Labour leader would be dependent on the maurauding Scottish horde, the electoral landscape looks pretty much perfect.

In contrast Labour has the SNP fighting them at every stage in Scotland, the Greens outflanking them on the left, the Lib Dems doing everything they can under Farron to regain the sensible left mantra, hundreds of thousands of new supporters, ongoing civil wars and factions, and a bunch of high profile people there to boost their image for the next leaders contest, massive funding issues from the new trade union bill based on their own system for determining voting, and the anchor of 'no one but Blair has ever won' hanging around their neck. Add into this th fact the Tories aren't just going to let them regroup and reorganise, but Osborne specifically is going to set up hurdle after hurdle to pigeonhole the party as early as he can with a favourable press lapping it up, and the result is clear.

Boosh finished about 6 years ago, TLOG over a decade ('02) - as for Apollo and MtW still rumbles on, although Apollo was last on, when? These are all old shows. 

As for BBC3, when was the last decent thing on it? Constant repeats of Top Gear or Don't Tell The Bride or any old film that wasn't a complete flop - 'Deep Impact' (1998) on Saturday, a film I'd expect to see on Five on some Tuesday afternoon, rather than BBC3 on a Saturday Night. Not that BBC1 is fairing any better. If it wasn't for the Lottery, Casualty and MotD they would be stuffed on Saturdays.

BBC2 these days? Endless travelling, gardening and cooking with the occassional 'nature' program to spice things up abit. If you're looking for the intellectual or interesting, that's tucked away on BBC4. 

Not like it's any better for ITV, copying BBC and stretching out channels with the useless ITVBe or Encore alongside the other three that cover fairly predictable ground -, Teen ITV2, Pensioners ITV3, and the 'For Men' ITV4.

So many times last season, I argued for starting Townsend over Lamela because of PACE and how it would open up our side.   (And against Chelsea and Arsenal, it worked) When it comes to our side being so slow, Lamela is the biggest culprit.

I agree it's a problem, and personally one which I think needs sorting out. I would advocate *mandatory* firearms safety training and minimum standards on how firearms and munitions would be stored safely. I would make it like a driving licence. Your firearm, much like your vehicle, needs to be registered. This can all be done without taking away the ""right"" to own or carry a firearm.  
People would still have the ""right"", provided that they demonstrated sufficient knowledge regarding keeping them out of reach of children/criminals and the dangers of waving them around like waterpistols. If you pass that assessment and don't have a criminal record, you're in. If you pass the tests, you can't later claim that you didn't intend to kill somebody when you shot at them, or that you didn't know that leaving your gun on the porch was a bad idea and you never intended for 6 year-old Billy next door to take it and shoot the babysitter.  
I also think that ""concealed carry"" should be the norm, so nobody knows who has the guns until they cross the rubicon. It adds an element of uncertainty for criminals. Apparently this is not a popular view, so I'm willing to be persuaded by arguments to ban ""concealed carry"" altogether, but I'm not sure what they are.  
Altogether, it would be better if the US just repealed the second ammendment, but with a strong NRA, that's simply not going to happen. We (or rather they), need to find a way of maintaining the second ammendment and still keeping firearms out of reach of those who are likely to kill innocents with them.  
Given that the second ammendment is supposed to be there to protect against tyrannous government, perhaps the penalty for shooting non-military personnel should be draconian.",null,0,null,1441057956,null,null,false,0,cumbc34,null,t3_3j26os,null,null,null,t1_cumajc0,null,null,null,1441614448,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

null,null,liwqyfhb,null,null,null,"There's probably not much benefit to paying it off early, but as ever with these things it's hard to tell.

For people with pre-2011 loans it's a *much* easier answer because the interest rate is so low (and capped at inflation!). That means that long term investments (Stocks &amp; Shares ISA or similar) will easily provide better returns over the repayment period than just repaying early and avoiding the interest. For that reason you'll often see people saying things like: ""It's madness to repay early, it's the best loan you'll ever have!"".

For you, though, the difference is smaller and the answer is less obvious:

I think your interest rate is about to fall to 3.9%, 20-year share performance is [more like 5%](http://monevator.com/uk-historical-asset-class-returns/), so comparisons to long-term investments are less clear cut.

The interest is more than inflation, so you can't justify not repaying because the amount is shrinking in real terms.

It's a difficult call. The deciding factor for many people will be the short-term benefits of having savings. Perhaps you could get on the property ladder if you had the money now, but repaying now is only going to give you cashflow benefits in 20 years time.",null,0,null,1441057970,null,null,false,0,cumbcg4,null,t3_3j4pt1,null,null,null,t3_3j4pt1,null,null,null,1441614453,null,7,null,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,7,null

The Doctor is not always right about everything.  The series is full of instances where the Doctor is wrong.  

&gt;  and pray the Doctor doesn't realize he could find MUCH better companions who could actually help him in his adventures. 

The Doctor doesn't choose companions based on how much they can ""help"" him.  They aren't his employees where all he cares about is what they bring to the table in the way of skills.  He chooses companions to travel with him because otherwise he would be too lonely in his travels and also he needs people that will keep him grounded in reality and morality.  In that sense, the only necessary skills for a companion are that they have a sense of adventure and a strong sense of what is right and wrong.  In fact, the Doctor would hate having a companion that automatically went along with what he said, never mind that it would be bad for the Doctor and bad for the show. It's boring if the companion just shuts and follows what the Doctor says. 

I really think you are unfairly picking on Rose and Donna.  You say that they should just shut up an bow to the Doctor's knowledge and experience.  You label them as uneducated shopworker and secretary.  However, you then say that the Eleventh Doctor's companions are better and that you prefer them.  However, you could say many of the same things about Amy Pond that you've said about Donna and Rose.  Amy constantly challenges the Doctor and very rarely just goes along with what he says.  Hell, we see that happen in her very first trip in the TARDIS (""The Beast Below"").  Plus, considering she is employed as a kissogram, you can't say that she is more educated or has any higher job than Donna and Rose.  

As for Clara, you could maybe make the argument that she is more educated due to her job as a teacher.  However, what is more important is that she is constantly challenging the Doctor and almost never immediately takes his word for anything. Hell, this is one of the key plot points in ""The Caretaker."" Even more importantly, it was Clara's questioning of the Doctor that at least partially led to the Doctor deciding to save Gallifrey rather than destroy it in ""The Day of the Doctor"".  The three Doctors are all ready to push the button to activate the moment and what stops them is her statement to Eleven that she never pictured him as the one wiping out his own people.  This then transitions into her speech to him about not being a warrior or hero, and instead, being a ""Doctor"". 

In the end, Amy and Clara tend to do the same thing for the Doctor as Donna and Rose.  If you are going to dislike Donna and Rose for their actions in regard to the Doctor, then it would stand to reason that you would dislike Clara and Amy as well.

The waste water on a dishwasher is a pretty thin pipe that can be attached to the existing P trap of the sink, the supply water can be similarly branched off the supply for the sink with T connectors. So that will be relatively easy, cheap(er), and quick. Definitely do-able as a DIY project if you follow a YouTube video for example.

Electricity is trickier obviously, if there is already a hidden power socket behind/inside the cabinets for the existing washing machine (and if it's a double so it can accommodate another appliance) and it's within range of the dishwasher's cord length then you're good to go as long as the circuit/fuses aren't being overloaded, the builder/electrician will know and advise. Otherwise they will just run you a new one as a spur, which doesn't need to be pretty behind cabinets unless you want it to be (or you have glass doors on them). Spurs aren't terribly expensive but not really the easiest amateur DIY job.

null,null,kisekikumo,null,null,null,"As someone who did one of these 'apprenticeships', I can safely say it was a waste of a year of my life.

I worked as a receptionist at a doctor's surgery (NHS), receiving no formal training on the job, just shadowing others. The actual NVQ was a waste. I wasn't allowed to take a L3 in Business and Administration, so I had to do an L2 instead. As someone with GCSE's and 4 full a A-Levels, it means nothing.

It was half an hour of going through homework each week. No teaching, and when it was, it was teaching me to suck eggs (highlight the text and change the font...)

I was verbally and physically assaulted by patients with addiction issues, with no help or support from anybody whatsoever. Why have a panic button when people aren't going to come to my aid and laugh about it afterwards. Being grabbed by the collar by an addict isn't fun, and for what? £2.50ish an hour. Great.

I had the same level of accountability as the regular staff. I had to hand out prescriptions for Methadone with no training on how those prescriptions work and laughed at by my manager when I asked for proper training.

I applied for other receptionist and admin jobs in and out of the NHS. My apprenticeship and NVQ count for nothing. Everybody wants RSA typing qualifications which I can't afford after that measly pay. It's impossible to save anything when you have to pay board money and transport fees.

You aren't guaranteed jobs after these apprenticeships finish under this new system, there is no stability. I was told I had to give up a part time degree I was doing in order to do this apprenticeship, yet it has got me nowhere.

Now, I guess with mechanics, beauty, engineering etc, you are given skills and can go into skilled work once finished. Retail, receptionists? Cheap labour. I was told there were no positions available after my year had finished, only for them to go and hire more apprentices despite leaving with great reference.

You can hire 3 apprentices to do your dirty work rather than employ 1 person normally and it makes sense, but it needs to be regulated so much more.

The government need to give more support to people who don't get jobs afterwards and haven't done anything wrong. They end up back on the job centre's doorstep, being told they are useless and it's all their fault that they can't find a job and get forced into more ridiculous programmes that should be reserved for the lazy scroungers only.

And they wonder why the youth are so disillusioned and apathetic. After going through the system, reaping none of the rewards that were promised, I can see why a lot of the people just don't bother afterwards after being let down in such a way.

Pay should be increased for apprentices to something they can live on. It would encourage employers to train them properly, give them real skills that they can rely on instead of going back as another statistic in youth unemployment.

Employers need to be checked, apprentice satisfaction levels gauged and complaints taken seriously. I wasn't the only person I knew to have been forced into one. All of my friends who did a non traditional one, quit before their year was up. Those who did mechanics, beauty, they are all in stable jobs and starting their careers.

The fact that we were on the top of the table from day 1 last season was a record achievement, don't count on it to be repeated in the very next season, especially given how our preseason started way later than everyone else's which was a conscious decision by the management in order to prevent fatigue in the second half of the season.

Jose is no fool to simply come back to Chelsea under an owner with a history of being trigger-happy. It is also impossible to keep winning the league every year. When he joined, he said that he would be given three years to win the league - something that he already managed in his second year. 

Here's what I think is going on. I think Roman has told Jose to focus more on long-term stability, youth development and a more pleasing style of play. He doesn't want the club to keep splashing money. Our transfer activity has been very measured. None of which are things Jose is particularly known for. In return, Jose has told him that these things take time and that results could suffer. So long as Chelsea don't drop out of the top 4 and gives a decent showing in the other competitions, I think his job is safe for a couple of seasons - unless Guardiola suddenly decides he wants to manage us.

Thing is if you said something like ""intervention was the right thing to do, both morally and geopolitically [in Iraq]. It [would have been] totally insane to then not help rebuild the place and leave it to competing rebel groups"" then people would probably say you were wrong. 

If intervention is the right thing to (if it was in Libya then it must have been in Iraq - Saddam had a much worse and more public record of mass killing, chemical weapon use and aggressive invasions) then either we help occupy the place, expend hundreds of our own soldiers and try and keep the peace during a brutal civil war or we bomb the place and get out. Either way lots of people die and everyone looks back and says ""Oh wasn't that stupid, we should have done something different"". 

Not only is that almost impossible to predict at the time but in hindsight people are so willing to argue we should have followed a different strategy knowing that they don't have to take responsibility for the failure which would result from their suggested plan. 

If you say that occupying Iraq was a mistake and we should have gone in quick and got out fast then you have to explain why that seems to have failed in Libya and how to avoid it in the future. If you think we should have occupied Libya then you have to explain why that failed so badly in Iraq and how to avoid that.

If you think we should never have intervened in either case you have to explain why it would have better for the people of that country to allow those murderous dictators to use their military against the citizens of that country and you should have to own up to the torturing and killing which would have resulted from that solution.

It's lose-lose-lose.

I'll give you some examples, if you'd like! FC Midtjylland's best player last season, Nigerian academy product Sylvester ""Sly"" Igboun wanted a higher salary, which the club couldn't give him, so he handed in a transfer request. He was then earlier this summer transferred to FC Ufa, a Russian club located in who the fuck knows and who are favorites for relegation this season. He was sold for an absolutely whopping 800.000 pounds... And this guy *killed* it in our league. 

Another example of a player lighting it up and being sold is Igor Vetokele, from Belgium, who played for FC København in the 13/14 season. He was one of the best strikers in the league, and was sold last summer after he told the club that he wanted to play in England. Man went to Charlton Athletic...

I would love for Yedlin to succeed for FCM because it's my family's team and I hope they only ever sign players that do well for the club, but if they're looking to loan him to a Superliga side at 22 years old, then he probably won't be playing for Spurs for a long time, if ever.",null,0,null,1441060687,null,null,false,0,cumd19c,null,t3_3j2vfc,null,null,null,t1_cum5naz,null,null,null,1441615249,null,1,null,coys,t5_2ryq7,1,null

&gt; 

Not at all. I just don't think we should loan him out somewhere with a sell on clause of under one million pounds. We spent almost 3 M on him and I think there's a club in the bottom half of the Premier League who'd take a chance on him at a price that would allow us to recoup our money.

&gt; I would love for Yedlin to succeed for FCM because it's my family's team and I hope they only ever sign players that do well for the club, but if they're looking to loan him to a Superliga side at 22 years old, then he probably won't be playing for Spurs for a long time, if ever.

null,null,gamas,null,null,null,"He was downvoted as they simply jumped on the ""DAE think the left love self-flagellation"" circlejerk rather than actually adding anything to the conversation. There is absolutely no evidence that Corbyn believes 9/11 was our fault. That is just hyperbole. Hell, the very article you linked to pointed out that Corbyn saw 9/11 as a tragedy, and that Corbyn was against everything Al Qaida.

If you want the actual reason Corbyn called the killing of Osama Bin Laden a tragedy, its for a similar reason to why Paddy Ashdown also called the killing a tragedy at the time.

The tragedy is not in his death but in the process towards his death. As Paddy Ashdown said, it was tantamount to an execution without trial. Yes, the verdict would have ultimately pointed to Osama's guilt, but the idea that some countries in the UN can just get away with an execution of its enemies without due process sets a very dangerous precedent, and undermines the UN's aims for global peace.

To quote Ashdown:

&gt;Let me make this very clear: I belong to a country which was founded on the principle of the exercise of the due process of law. I am dedicated to that I have to say to you that it is not a good enough excuse to say that we will not follow due process because it’s too difficult, to take that position is to undermine the very principle on which this country stands and to which I am dedicated. If you allow someone to be executed because the due process of law is too difficult to follow, you take a very dangerous step in exactly the wrong direction.

Now I'd imagine, given Corbyn's pacifist stance and general ""human rights for all"" stances, he would perhaps go a little further and be against any state-sponsored execution - preferring that Osama be jailed for life. That whilst Osama has killed a lot of people, it is our duty to set a moral standard by rising above killing out of vengeance - how can we go telling people that killing is wrong whilst sponsoring killings in our name? Corbyn is rather uncompromising with his pacifism, preferring diplomacy over war in all cases. It's not about believing that all the world's problems are the West's fault, it's about believing that the best way to combat violence is to rise above it and instead fight a war of words. By stooping to their level we simply encourage more violence, as they will simply say ""well you guys are fine killing our people, so we'll keep killing yours"".

Moving away from pacifist and pro-diplomatic principle based arguments (a tragedy in itself that holding the view that using violence to counter violence is wrong is considered extreme...), there is an argument that by killing Osama this way, we raised Osama to martyr status amongst his supporters and thus fanned the flames that are burning us now...",null,0,null,1441060915,null,null,1441061430,0,cumd6fj,null,t3_3j3qvi,null,null,null,t1_cumauy5,null,null,null,1441615317,null,6,null,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,6,null

The whole West African economy was based on who could get more slaves, to sell for guns, to get more slaves. It totally decimated the region. The Arab slave trade affected less people over a longer period of time, that's why it doesn't have such a big effect.

Colonial governing didn't just not prevent atrocities it usually was the cause and the massacring party, just look at the Belgium Congo, the gassing of civilians in Ethiopia, the Herero and Namaqua Genocide in Nambia, the Mau Mau uprising in the 50s, I could go on. You can't just dismiss multiple genocides because it's inconvenient. 

The British (and other European countries) were the main cause of the external slave trade that destroyed African civilisations. True they ended the practise of slavery but after 400 years of raping African lands it was a bit late. 

African countries had laws. It wasn't the wild west. The concept of a state was very much in place in many parts of Africa. The Malian Empire, Zulu Kingdom, the Songhai Empire, Hausa, Ethiopia, again I could go on. [There's even a handy wikipedia page!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_kingdoms_in_pre-colonial_Africa)

Finally this idea that European infastructure was helpful is again bullshit. The infrastructure was to facilitate the transfer of goods from the interior to ports as quickly as possible. It wasn't there to link population centres together. It wasn't there to help the natives. It was there to move as many natural resources back to European factories as quickly as possible.

null,null,dlbob3,null,null,null,"Yeah or not.  Jeremy Corbyn is the sovereign of the Imperium of Man, and Father, Guardian, and God of the human race. He has sat immobile within the Golden Throne of Terra for ten thousand years. Although once a living man, his shattered body can no longer support life, and remains intact only by a combination of ancient technology and the sheer force of his will, itself sustained by the soul-sacrifice of countless millions of psykers.

His will is omnipotent, extending across the million worlds that comprise his United Kingdom. For ten thousand years the Master of Mankind has served humanity, simultaneously carrying out a multitude of tasks vital to its survival. All at once He guides his race through the Prime Ministers's Tarot, soul-binds psykers, holds audiences with Sinn Fein and directs the Astronomican beacon that guides space vessels with women-only carriages through the Warp. His immense psychic powers constantly keep the Tories in the Warp at bay, preventing their intrusion into the material universe and protecting his people throughout the galaxy.

Jermy Corbyn's role as guardian of mankind seems to have been predestined for him. Without Jeremy Corbyn there would be no Imperium, little space travel, and no protection from the multitude of threats facing low income workers or the unemployed. Jeremy Corbyn knows that to protect his race he must survive as long as necessary for the emerging race of psychic humans to evolve sufficiently.

In the millennia since his ascension to 10 Downing Street, the Prime Minister has become a god to his people, the worship of Him uniting humanity throughout his Imperium, superstition and dogma replacing his doctrine of Democratic Socialism.

Blairites refers to Jeremy Corbyn as The Anathema.

The US doesn't get to unilaterally decide international law (other than in the sense that through the use of force, no-one can oppose them).  This is exactly what I meant by the erosion of the rule of law.  

Regardless of whether you agree with this, it takes a wilful misreading of what Corbyn said to interpret it as you do.  Even a cursory reading of the article would have made this clear to you:

&gt; ”no attempt whatsoever that I can see to arrest him and put him on trial, to go through that process”.

&gt;“The World Trade Center was a tragedy, the attack on Afghanistan was a tragedy, the war in Iraq was a tragedy. Tens of thousands of people have died. Torture has come back on to the world stage, been canonised virtually into law by Guantanamo and Bagram.""

Do you still hold that...

&gt;Corbyn believes simply that 9/11 was our fault, and thus killing Osama was not justified.


I actually agree with your more general point that parts of the left does have a problem with anti-US sentiment going overboard.  However, I don't think that you should put everybody on the left in this camp, but rather treat each person on a case by case basis.

null,null,DoktorStrangelove,lfcwfmm,,null,"&gt; How bad are thigh injuries usually?

There is no real answer to this, it varies wildly depending on the nature of the injury. Impact injury? Maybe out for a week or two, max, assuming it's mostly just bruising. Strain, pull or tear? Could be much longer. 

On the plus side, if it's something along the front of the thigh, like an injury to his quad, that's an area where it's much harder to give yourself a strain (compared to, say, a hamstring or groin) so if it's in that region of his thigh it's more likely to be some sort of bad bruise.

Mate where do you think we are? This subreddit is a proper centre-left middle class circlejerk if I ever did see one.

The man commented on the issue too, he contributed towards discussion whereas I didn't but I get downvoted less than that gent. An injustice there if I ever did see one but this is reddit, land of the petty disagreement where ass kissing and brownnosing are the common ways to shake a hand around here. But I digress.

The solution that such a leftist would want is the imprisonment of such an individual, an injustice. A man orders and plans the attack that kills almost 3,000 people and he gets a comfy bed and some books to read until the end of his days? Hardly a terrible existence in our age of NEETs and youth unemployment, you'd think prison and homelife wasn't too different.

This sense of moral ground is false, we're not better for not killing people and never will be superior just because our method of execution i.e. in a jail cell over several decades is allegedly more ""humane"". Often I hear in the same breath that prison is worse than execution because they have to rot in a cell for the rest of their life. Doesn't sound humane if the punishment is worse than execution. These moral standards the left likes to place upon others as if we are inherently better and ""we know right"".

&gt;Corbyn is rather uncompromising with his pacifism, preferring diplomacy over war in all cases.

Chamberlain was very keen on peace, that doesn't mean his attitude was the correct course of action. With threats like ISIS direct military action from our nation must be undertaken lest the situation worsen itself even more than the slave markets, the rape as worship, the destruction of all cultural heritage. I'm no fan of war believe me but ultimately lives can be saved in the long term by stopping violence getting even worse, spreading far beyond its current borders. 

&gt;it's about believing that the best way to combat violence is to rise above it and instead fight a war of words.

This will not stop the AK putting a bullet through your head. The trouble is with Corbyn's pacifism is that it doesn't stop an aggressor, it can only hope to stop conflict through peaceful resolution. This peace process takes two sides though, a group like ISIS will not back down whatsoever as they're religious fanatics. 

&gt;we raised Osama to martyr status amongst his supporters and thus fanned the flames that are burning us now...

I can't agree with such a sentiment, I believe the Iraq War and Afghanistan to be the real reasons for such a wave of violence in the Middle East. Osama's death did not inspire more to fight, the same people would have fought.

&gt;An American official cautioned that without proof of Mueller's death, the statement by ISIS could be a ploy to cause the Jordanians and the rest of the American-led coalition to refrain from any heavier airstrikes.[7]

&gt;Jordan's Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh called ISIS's claim ""an old and sick trick"" on Twitter. ""So they behead innocent #US #UK &amp; Japan hostages &amp; BURN a brave #Jordan pilot ALIVE &amp; now a hostage is killed by an airstrike? Sure! Sick!"", he said.[30][31] He further tweeted: ""An old and sick trick used by terrorists and despots for decades: claiming that hostages human shields held captive are killed by air raids.""[32] Later upon confirmation of Mueller's death he tweeted: ""Saddened &amp; angered to hear news confirming killing of #US hostage #kaylaMueller.

OP is likely just trying to pin that on poor mental fortitude rather than a combination of issues at Lyon (of both money and players) plus what Lovren's really level probably is.

Personally I think he's just not a smart player at all, thus why he only does well with a really solid defensive structure in the midfield in front of him. If you give him too much space to cover or too much responsibility/individual decisions to make then he quickly deteriorates. This is a bit different from mental toughness because it's not like he just cracks under pressure so much as he just pretty much can't process/doesn't know what he's supposed to do.

The way we were playing up on West Ham and got caught is exactly the thing that's poisonous to Lovren's game because it's too open in front of him and to the side, so he simply has too much to do.

I've been mugged and attacked on the street at random at many points in my life. I have scars on my face, hands, arms, legs and feet. Emotionally I'm a little desensitized in general.

If rape victims don't want to hear about rape at all, too bad. It happens. You deal with your issues by confronting them and not running away. Hiding from your problems only makes them worse. I'm not saying that rape victims should have to relive their experiences over and over, just that the mere mention of the word should not cause them to have a breakdown and demand that no one else have the freedom to discuss important issues. 

Kids today are too soft, they're easily offended and often can't agree to disagree with someone they talk to. If they can't agree on everything just cut them out of your life instead of having a friend with different opinions.

Yeah I've been around rape survivors myself too. My family took in one when I was a teenager, she ended up becoming a prostitute which was a shame. 

It is not that society does not accommodate trauma survivors, it is that such survivors who have not resolved and dealt with their issues wish to intrude upon the rights of others to even discuss issues in the first place. How in anyone's mind can a man speaking about abortion cause such terrible discomfort in people that a debate must be cancelled on the grounds of hurting mental health?! This is what you are defending here.

But I tell you what mate, go ahead and downvote me again, go ahead and tell me to go fuck myself again for thinking that men and women are strong and able to deal with any kind of shit that comes their way. At the end of the day I've known suffering in my life and I've dealt with it, I've conquered it and I've come out a stronger person for it. I don't need to make excuses for myself or stop other people from talking about the same issues that I've faced. If it really is so bad that I can't bear to hear about it, maybe its just best that I leave where I am and let everyone else carry on talking like a mature, responsible individual instead of projecting my bad experiences onto others.

null,null,blueboyrob123,null,null,null,"Its a combination of some very simple factors.
1) Far too many of our best players have just been playing appallingly, some for a sustained period of time. This season Matic, Iva, JT and Hazard have looked woefully below par. Combine that with how rubbish Fabregas and Costa have been since February last year and our team looks bang out of form.

2) I think the club got pre season horribly wrong. The failure to improve the first team and squad until late August was criminal, everyone knows reigning PL champions have to improve their squads and the benefits of doing business early were well documented last season. Its also clear our ridiculous schedule of friendlies, including the trip to Aus straight after the end of last season have meant we started this season with players looking very fatigued.

3) I do also think Mourinho has to take some responsibility. He struggles with creating any longevity at a club, highlighted by his third season syndrome. He hasn't developed a squad where he trusts enough players, he has his favourite 13 and thats it, the others rarely get a look in. I have no idea how players like Remy stay motivated, but JM seriously needs to decide if he truly wants to stay at the club for the next 10 years. If he does he needs to drop the whole hostile, 'us against them' mentality and create a balanced squad where there is genuine competition for places.


Tbh I think its been a bit of a perfect storm, we clearly weren't prepared for the start of the season and we've come up against some very tough teams.
There is no way the title is over yet, the PL is far too competitive and City remain a squad susceptible to injury and fracture.
The boys need to sort it out ASAP, but in JM and JT I Trust.

Does come with a monthly 'fee' to the local area community of £320 a month, but in that we'd get our electricity, water, tv license, phone and fibre broadband and any repairs to the external of the house are paid for by said local area community.
