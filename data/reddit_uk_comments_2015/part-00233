If you think this, you need to re-read my post.

&gt; That doesn't therefore mean you are correct.

My points about remaining in education, marrying and joining the army are all correct because they are facts. As are the ones about tax and exams. Of course that doesn't mean it's necessarily correct that 16-year-olds shouldn't vote. We can certainly continue to discuss the ramifications of what I have pointed out.

&gt; We do tend to be more liberal and progressive in our views in comparison to the conservative English narrative.

I'm glad you are so pleased with yourselves. If this is the right thing, perhaps you'd care to put forward a decent argument for why 16-year-olds should be able to vote in England given that we do not consider them responsible enough to do the things discussed?

&gt;I find your obsession with being right and wrong, and desperation to 'win' extremely immature and distasteful.

I'm not obsessed at all. It would be nice for you to acknowledge my points though. I did you the courtesy of replying to all yours. There isn't anything to win here but we can have a little fun.

The honour violence was from a Panorama investigation, and concerned British Muslims. Does it matter if non-Muslims from the area also think the same way? It doesn't change how the Muslims from that culture in Britain feel.

That's grand. If they don't want to drink alcohol, that's cool, that's optional. Having it an actual national law for all? That is wrong, even if we are only talking about the frankly less extreme parts which make up the majority of it. If I want to drink alcohol I should be allowed to, even if someone else disagrees with it. Not only that, but by showing they thoroughly want to implement something dear to their religion begs the question of what else from the Qur'an they take as seriously. There's a lot of nasty stuff in there.

EDIT: Sorry, I got a bit off-topic. The original piece concerns Dave's comments which as I said originally seem totally fair to me personally.

Well, if Daily Mail regularly spreads misinformation and conveniently leaves some important info out for the story they're selling, especially when they do this on a regular basis against certain groups, then it's biased against them and shouldn't be taken seriously for anything relating to these groups they're biased against.

&gt;The honour violence was from a Panorama investigation, and concerned British Muslims. Does it matter if non-Muslims from the area also think the same way? It doesn't change how the Muslims from that culture in Britain feel.

Article only mentions Muslim. Not Asian Muslim. Just Muslim. Your post also mentions Muslim without corresponding Asian tag. You're implying that honour violence is somehow related to Islam or Muslims which is totally false.

&gt;That's grand. If they don't want to drink alcohol, that's cool, that's optional. Having it an actual national law for all? That is wrong, even if we are only talking about the frankly less extreme parts which make up the majority of it. If I want to drink alcohol I should be allowed to, even if someone else disagrees with it. Not only that, but by showing they thoroughly want to implement something dear to their religion begs the question of what else from the Qur'an they take as seriously. There's a lot of nasty stuff in there.

You missed the point. It is law for Muslims and only if they choose to agree to. Sharia courts exist for that reason. What the 40% are voting for, satisfies the current situation we have now.

Free schools are a weird one. I'm not in education any more but my MSc dissertation is and will be on school performance. 

My view is purely on a performance and not policy mind you. I

Looking at the publicly available data, it is just too early to judge free schools based on their performance. Most free schools tend to not have been inspected or had their most recent exams published because the pupils have yet to take them. Academies tend to do worse than non academy schools as a whole but they tend to be either great schools or really bad ones so performance averages out. My dissertation will look at whether like for like schools and academies perform any differently. Not sure what I'm going to find yet.

The concerns in the article is opaqueness on funding agreements, which I don't have much knowledge of but you want pupils to leave schools with a good education. From an analyst stand point, if the services delivered better education, be it grades or better job prospects then its a win for me. Whether its cost effective I can't draw conclusions without working there. Now if free schools and academies perform worse than normal schools under similar circumstances then I'm more than happy to condemn but there's too little information and too short a time period to make any sound conclusions.

In fact it's fairly blatant from the lack of murders or assaults related to such a thing, although that might be because those from family's devout enough to practice it are afraid to leave, but I digress. I would however definitely relate it to Islam and not just certain 'cultures'. See Qur'an 2:191-193, 3:151, 4:76, among countless other sections which condone those kinds of actions. Then looks at things like the aforementioned ISIS, which kills in the name of their religion. Of course, people use the old No True Scotsman and claim that they aren't ''true'' Muslims, and that it doesn't count, but to me it is a problem of religion when those that are committing the acts themselves claim it is for a religious cause, whether another person's interpretation of the religious text differs or not.

Also fair enough.

You do need water but water is heavy so don't overdo it. I carried 2 litres but only drank 1.5 litres but it was not that hot. If it's warm/hot you'll need more water. 

Carry plasters or compeed blister plasters.

Make sure you apply plenty of sunblock before you set off. I caught the sun a bit even with sunblock and a cloudy day.

Make sure your boots fit and there is no rubbing. Carry a spare pair(s) of socks and change them half way. Adjust/tighten your boots at the first feeling of your feet slipping or rubbing.

The guy is at his peak earning time. 

In any case, comparing him to Moreno is silly, as Moreno will re-sign for a lot more, as will our other young players, and they will cost more than Enrique does over the life of his 5-year deal.

Why you wouldn't say that when you were the one who brought this up when it was irreverent to the article?

&gt;In fact it's fairly blatant from the lack of murders or assaults related to such a thing, although that might be because those from family's devote enough to practice it are afraid to leave, but I digress. 

You got any evidence for this?

&gt;See Qur'an [2:191-193](http://islamnewsroom.com/news-we-need/329-yusuf-estes-correcting-quran-misquotes#7), 3:151, 4:76, among countless other sections which condone those kinds of actions

I linked to a page explaining 2:191-193 verse in its context. All other verses are quoted out of context as well. Quoting those verses shows your lack of understanding of those verses. Unless you're reading them out of context, they absolutely do not condone those actions.

&gt;then looks at things like the aforementioned ISIS, which kills in the name of their religion. Of course, people use the old No True Scotsman and claim that they aren't ''true'' Muslims, and that it doesn't count, but to me it is a problem of religion when those that are committing the acts themselves claim it is for a religion cause, whether another person's interpretation of the religious text differs or not.

Qur'an context is not up for interpretation as illustrated by many of scholars. By the way, ISIS does not use these verses to justify their actions.

I haven't even said they're not Muslims. You're already one step ahead. Anyway, do you realise that in Islam, Muslims are already hesitant to declare one other as non-Muslim (or not true Muslim) due to serious sin penalty associated with it? Not many Muslims are saying that they're not 'true Muslims'. Those who do, are committing serious sin.

No True Scotsman argument doesn't really apply if you're talking about interpretations. If the scripture says don't do x (In most cases this is not up for interpretation). You have one group doing X and claims to do it because they follow the scripture, then they're wrong, as simple as that. It is flawed logic to say that religion condones doing X because of a group that does X.",null,1,null,1434736134,null,0,false,0,csc2s7r,null,t3_3aezkt,null,t1_csc2s7r,null,t1_csc1vff,null,null,null,1437195628,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

null,false,jactertor,null,null,null,"A cut in corporation tax may not be the way the economy is rebalanced - it will reduce public expenditure but it is no sure thing that we then experience great growth or that the overall effects will be positive. There is a good report by Alan Trench/IPPR on devo finance (in general), which puts forward a few problems with this particular tax cut ([p30](http://www.ippr.org/assets/media/images/media/files/publication/2013/01/funding-devo-more_Jan2013_10210.pdf?noredirect=1)):

&gt; There is a further implication of those rules. Cuts in corporation tax to spur economic growth would have to be paid for by increased revenue from other sources or reductions in public spending and in public services. The scale of such a cut in Scotland would be considerable; a cut to 20 per cent (from the current 24 per cent) would reduce spending there by £890 million, and to 12.5 per cent (the level in the Republic of Ireland) by £1,724 million, even excluding offshore oil and gas revenues. (The amounts would be much larger if oil and gas were included.) The amount of extra growth in GDP required to compensate for such a loss is considerable; 2 per cent in the former case, 4 per cent in the latter. To make a substantial cut in corporation tax, a government would need to be very confident indeed that it could generate such a high level of growth, if it also wants to maintain existing levels of public services.

And then there will be other problems: It's cyclical and volatile (and so shouldn't be the underpinning of the economy); the inevitable brass-plating; potential for a race-to-the-bottom with ROI.

""Kids come in all sizes and each person's body burns energy (calories) at different rates, so there isn't one perfect number of calories that a kid should eat. But there is a recommended range for most school-age kids: 1,600 to 2,200 per day.

When they reach puberty, girls need more calories than before but they tend to need fewer calories than boys. As boys enter puberty, they may need as many as 2,500 to 3,000 calories per day, especially if they are very active. But whether they are girls or boys, kids who are active and move around a lot will need more calories than kids who don't.""

So my routine right now (after being told to use the AHA in the evening) is:

**AM** (assume I am doing all this to chest up, front and back)

*Cleanse with the Cetaphil Gentle skin Cleanser. 

*Swipe of a red Stridex wipe - focusing on problem areas

*Moisturise with a Nivea day cream SPF15

**PM**

*Remove makeup with Johnson &amp; Johnson sensitive skin wipes

*Remove tough eye makeup with Benefit's They're Real remover

*Cleanse with the Cetaphil cleanser again

*Then use the Alpha Hydrox AHA 10%

*The use any specialised prescribed lotions / spot treatments

*Moisturise with Cetaphil Lotion


I wait 10-15 minutes after using the Sridex pads and the AHA to use the moisturiser.

evans also says that we may be in a worse situation now than we were then? absolutely not. that is the biggest load of bollocks, and a completely deplorable statement. 

furthermore, when talking about potential suitors to buy the club, we have instructure that is being built right now. our stadium will be right up there with the best of them, we have reduced the wage bill, we have a ton of young players at our core, and an academy that is producing a lot of good talents. furthermore, melwood is getting a little bit of a makeover and a buyer would also be inheriting all of the proprietary relationships with sponsors as well. liverpool is a very attractive purchase for buyers and i fully disagree with tony evans. our social media presence, global presence, revenues, player valuations, etc, etc etc make us a very attractive club to buy. throw on top of that guaranteed tv money that we have and we would be able to find a buyer within 3 months, guaranteed.

Normally, we're very sharp eyed, the sort of people who pick through contracts with a fine-tooth comb, but we had to sign the contract in a hurry because they were giving us a very short deadline - it was a great flat at an absurdly cheap price and we needed to move for my job with no alternative lined up, so we didn't want to lose it. There was a lot of confusion over paperwork, with multiple versions being provided until we eventually signed yet another final version. We thought the reference to 6 months in the contract we eventually signed was just because that was the break point and that it would carry on as another 6-month contract after that. 

We just wanted a 12-month contract but were happy to put up with it since they said it was unlikely the landlord would want to break at 6 months, and our previous flat had been on repeated 6-month contracts so that didn't seem unusual to us. Instead, at 6 months it turned into a rolling AST without us noticing, until they served us notice two months later. We were dealing with two lettings agencies, one subcontracted to the other (warning sign!) and each blamed the other. 

I had written proof we'd been told it was a 12-month contract, but they equally pointed out that we'd signed the 6-month contract and hadn't challenged the fact that the contract hadn't been renewed. We decided to throw our energy into buying a house during the two months' notice rather than fighting the eviction, but it meant we had no desire whatsoever to help out the lettings agencies.

In fact, he was much better at going forward and tracking back than say, Glen Johnson, who looked totally gassed after the 60th minute sometimes.

Cetaphil cleanser is not that gentle, it has a sulphate surfactant. Ditto the vast majority of commercial shampoos and body washes. Stridex has a sulphate, menthol and fragrance IIRC, all of which can be irritant. You might want something gentler yet stronger (if that makes sense) for the body.

They are photosensitising *for up to a week after ceasing use* so morning or evening is irrelevant. Any PIH or PIE makes sunscreen even more important.

Overall I am sticking with my initial assessment that there is much more take than give in your routine. Check out the ingredients Wiki, especially the entries that cover retinoids, vitamin C derivatives (SAP), and niacinamide. Retinoids are also photosensitising so again, sunscreen is critical.

Since you will be using a higher factor sunscreen ensure you are eating plenty of oily fish for the vitamin D and long chain omega-3s. Experts advocate up to four servings a week. This supplies a raft of skin friendly nutrients.

Many people seem to resent her increasing realism, and I can't help but suspect that many fans who liked her better in S7 are simply showing a preference for an older style of female sidekick (in TV series in general, I mean) -- the softer, sweeter, more ""likable girl"" who lives ""to save the Doctor""; S7 Clara, IMO, knows her place and fulfills it admirably, but as a character she's a stereotype and a bit of a bore.  Moffat said S7 Clara was a plot-mule.  It looks to me as if bringing on board an actor of the intensity and skills of Capaldi made it imperative that Clara develop some real, flawed heft to her character so that she could hold the screen with his also flawed and impulsive Doctor.  Moffat &amp; co did a brilliant job of this, IMO.

I'm in agreement, I am responsible for jumping the gun a bit because I'm kinda not in support of Farage leading the party right now anyway. 

&gt;Support him as a leader of UKIP; don't buy into the Bloom narrative. He was okay with him when he shared a flat in Brussels with him. It was Bloom when still part of the party that described it as ""herding cats"" when it came to the rank and file, and who appealed for a firmer hand.

I'm not against Farage as leader because of Bloom at any stretch, I think Bloom being forced out of UKIP was a very good thing.

&gt;It's interesting that this is all on the following an Independent interview and headline Farage gave saying pretty much the same thing - that he himself realised that he was polarising - and an LBC interview where he said that he foresaw the OUT campaign being headed by somebody outside politics and without political baggage.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7269790.stm

&gt;The government has launched the first stage of a new points-based system for migrants from outside the EU.
It will initially only apply to highly skilled workers already in the country who want to extend their stay.
But by the end of 2008, every graduate with good English, on £40,000 or the local equivalent, will potentially have enough points to seek work in the UK

&gt;But low skilled workers from outside the EU will be barred for the foreseeable future. The government believes it can fill all manual work vacancies from EU countries which, with the exception of Romania and Bulgaria, face no restrictions on working in the UK.
Prime Minister Gordon Brown said people wanted a system of managed migration. He said: ""If you've got a skill to offer, we're happy to look at what you have to offer to our country.

&gt;""But obviously if we don't need the skill, if you haven't got a skill, then there's a case for us saying that this is not the right time for you to apply to come to our country.""

Extended story lines is a story-telling method often found in SF (Robinson's Mars trilogy, for example), and I'm interested in seeing both the successes and the failures with this approach in DW.  I liked the Missy intro and the ""reveal"", though plenty didn't -- and many spotted it coming, but enjoyed it anyway.  Or not. This fandom is vast; it contains multitudes, and they don't all go to DW for the same things.

I think Moffat and the whole creative crew have been invigorated and freed from some of a vast load of accumulated DW baggage by taking on a new lead actor who's himself a committed fan and, like most fans, an expert himself in the show's long history.  DW leaped up several notches with S8, IMO, and I am hoping for more excellence with S9.

As for characters, that's a matter of the tastes you bring to the show, IMO.  Either you like exploring the inferences of layering and depth, or you want beautiful and highly functional surface structure more -- an explicitness that's often brought to a high shine at the expense of nuance.  I like nuance; it makes me do a bit of highly pleasurable thinking-work.  Nuance and layering invite me to some extent to be a participant in the experience, and re-watching becomes very rewarding.

If I want something ""sold to me on the first try"", I look more toward other values -- great special effects, broad (but rather thin) and consistent character definition, a clockwork plot with many perfectly articulated moving parts, and a high pitch of concentrated energy that flies like an arrow to its target.  That I find most often in good short stories and fast-paced adventure films, but I don't go looking for it in DW, so I don't miss it.

On character -- ""her personality changes from episode to episode depending on what the situation calls for"" reads to me as, she's not static, she's not a flat character -- and she seems *more* realistic because this is how real humans live their lives.  Different situations draw out different aspects of our personalities too, forcing us to grow.  That, to me, is what Clara is doing, and it works because Jenna Coleman convinces me that her Clara has a through-line that holds it all together.  It happens to be a through-line that jinks and jibes, which is what she needs to get through the varying situations that S8 threw at her + her own need to make some huge decisions at this point in her life.  This didn't work for you.  It worked very well for me.  I see that as evidence of very good, stimulating and challenging work by the creative team.",null,0,null,1434742903,null,0,false,0,csc71uj,null,t3_3ae20r,null,t1_csc71uj,null,t1_csbs2wb,null,null,null,1437198420,null,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2,null

&gt;*ACL - We've all seen that in the past season he was a shadow of his former self, and his current performances for Colombia don't indicate that it wasn't entirely down to Man Utd's play style. He could never regain his old abilities.*

&gt;*Confidence - Because of the lack of form, he seems to have 0 confidence.*

&gt; **He could never regain his old abilities.**



If you go back and look at his style, it was all about reading the game &amp; being in the right place at the right time coupled with his technical &amp; athletic ability. He read the game exceptionally well &amp; was a pure finisher to boot. Go on Youtube &amp; find any goals where he purely beats a man for pace, he was always seemed to receive a pass, drop a shoulder, beat a man with pure technique then score from 30 yards! Just look at that hat trick against us in the Super Cup when he was on fire, there were 3 of our defenders between him &amp; the net for every goal he scored.

I truly believe it's purely a confidence issue &amp; nothing to do with his old ACL injuries. You can't judge him on his Utd era, all the Utd fans that I know who go to OT &amp; away games week in, week out say that it was only a run of games that he needed but LVG just didn't give him that. He was treated with utter disrespect, playing Falcao in the Youth team at Utd is disgraceful, no wonder his confidence took a knock. Just google what 3 of the top surgeons in the field of ACLs have to say about his recovery. I think Utd had an agenda &amp; his face didn't fit LVG's plans so they demoralised him as an excuse to get rid, Their loss, our gain??

After those few shitty seasons, who better to put his arm around him &amp; get him back to form than Mou? **BUT**, he will need to play on a regular basis &amp; If DC holds up, will he get the time he needs? Half hour at the end of a prem game then 89 mins in the carling cup but on the bench for the next 2 prem games will really not be what he needs IMHO.

Bottom line, I'd take him all day long, if he can get to 80% of what he was, he still pisses on Giroud! In Mou we trust!",null,0,null,1434743868,null,0,false,0,csc7nom,null,t3_3afcro,null,t1_csc7nom,null,t3_3afcro,null,null,null,1437198670,null,10,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,10,null

Some choice bits: 

Also in March 2012 a Goldman executive director named Greg Smith published an op-ed in the New York Times announcing his departure from what he called **a “toxic and destructive” environment at the firm, saying he could “no longer in good conscience identify with what it stands for.”**
 
then a month later :

In April 2012 the SEC and FINRA fined Goldman $22 million for failing to prevent its employees from passing illegal stock tips to major customers.
 
Shortly after:

In July 2012 a federal appeals court rejected an effort by Goldman to overturn a $20.5 million arbitrator’s award to investors in the failed hedge fund Bayou Group who had accused Goldman of helping to perpetuate a Ponzi scheme.  
 
Goldman are an appalling company we should stay clear of.

Radamel Falcao is undergoing an intensive fitness programme at Manchester United’s Carrington training ground during the international break so that he can finally get himself into peak condition.
The 28-year-o
ld striker was omitted from the Colombia squad for their friendly matches against the United States at Craven Cottage last Friday and Slovenia in Ljubljana this Tuesday and wants to use the time to get himself fit enough to feature regularly for United. The club are confident he can do so.

Crucially there is no chronic problem with Falcao’s left knee - despite claims to the contrary - and no reason why he should not return to his best.

A post-match photograph, released by United and posted by Falcao on Instagram, set the story running. It showed him sitting with his team-mates with an ice pack and towel over the knee where he suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury in a French Cup tie in January.

It led to suggestions that his long-term fitness was in doubt and that players at United were surprised that he was ‘ice-ing’ the knee, even though having to do so is not unusual.

Falcao then reacted angrily on social media, tweeting: “One fool speculates. A few others lacking objectivity respond and millions believe lies. It is disastrous what a few fools can do.”

He is not the only one who is angry. The eminent Portuguese surgeon who carried out the operation on his knee, Jose Carlos Noronha, is believed to be annoyed that his statements claiming Falcao had made a full recovery are now being called into question.
What appears to have happened is this: Falcao underwent his operation and worked incredibly hard on his rehab to try and make it to the World Cup. He was included in Colombia’s 30-strong training squad but did not quite make the cut because it was decided he was not fully ready.

Falcao then had a break - and naturally slackened his fitness regime, partly probably through disappointment - and subsequently fell foul of the uncertainty at his then club, Monaco, when it was clear they were trying to move him on and he would not feature.
It affected his pre-season preparations, meaning he did not get the right amount of conditioning work, before he then secured his season-long loan to United.

There was also, inevitably, immediate pressure for him to play at United and, again, he may not have been in peak condition. Manager Louis Van Gaal works his players hard and Falcao, naturally, was keen to impress.

Subsequently he has struggled for fitness and collected other injuries as a result, including the calf strain that has ruled him out of United’s last three matches.

But United are not concerned about Falcao’s knee. The joint is not in perfect shape but that, again, is regarded as a result of his overall lack of match fitness and not something more serious.
This current international break, it is hoped, will give his club and the player time to finally put things right. Whether United eventually take up the option to sign Falcao permanently at the end of this season remains to be seen. But if they do not it will not be because of his knee.

Again whats with the Daily Mail? And yeah I know that but that's irrelevant to the conversation when Muslims are still supporting them.

For one thing they're completely unequatable but for another I don't think many Christians didn't condemn him? Also he didn't have mass support like ISIS.

null,false,thatevilvoice2,null,null,null,"&gt;growth in the economy? The UK economy has grown every year from 2010 onwards.

It's been pretty much the worst UK recovery in recent history. [Source](https://pureresearchgroup.com/blog/2014/02/uk-recessions-recoveries/) hardly something to be proud of.

&gt;but it's very much inline with what France has seen.

Well firstly we are not dragged down by being in the euro. We have much greater control over ourselves than any of the major european countries. Secondly France's gdp fell to a much less degree during the recession meaning that their GDP recovered to the previous peak several years before we did as you can see in this [graph.](http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/25/1406283080564/2af8fa95-839a-4ff8-bd23-2c195bc21a31-620x530.png)

&gt;The deficit has reduced every year from 2010 onwards as well.

Of course it did, that is what recovery from a recession generally entails. You have massive increase in public spending due to reduction in tax receipts, said receipts start to increase again leading to reduction in overall public borrowing. The issue is that the decrease in tax receipts was large but the increases afterwards were very low.

&gt;So what are you really suggesting? To achieve the same deficit reduction, let alone better results, without austerity would have required very substantial growth rates.

Not especially, an annual increase of around 2.5% (which is only a little above the average growth of the UK economy for the past 30 years and about what it is doing now) in 2010 - 2013 combined with little to no additional spending by government could have largely wiped out the deficit.

&gt;very substantial growth rates. Something not seen in any of out neighbours, and something we shouldn't really expect to see in one of the most developed economies in the world.

Over the long term since the recession, the UK has performed worse than pretty much all developed countries other than Italy.

What should push his price up IMO are:
 1. British Premium.
 2. Importance to our team.
 3. City's lack of home-grown players.
 4. Potential and ability.
 5. We have two years left on his contract.

I doubt there were many Muslims that didn't condemn ISIS if asked about it.

Completely missing the point.

The point is there's truth in a lot of their criticisms, but it doesn't justify violence. Until we admit that the west is basically committing terrorism through illegal wars and drone strikes killing civilians, giving a reason for young muslims being vulnerable to cult groups like ISIS,  it won't stop. Especially when people like you, the right-wing media, &amp; David Cameron continue to act like even trying to understand it from the young people recruited perspectives makes you a 'terrorist sympathiser'.

The best advice I have if you're thinking about policy is to specialise, getting a generic 'policy job' is hard as lots of grads come out with social science degrees wanting that career path. Getting a job in a specific policy area is a little easier, and you can progress more quickly as a specialist. I'd think about trying to kill two birds with one stone and try to get some experience in a few areas you may be interested in (you don't have to do a fancy internship):
-Social mobility, volunteer to work at your university's partner schools/colleges
-Enviroment, join the committee of people and planet (or similar) at your uni
-Infrastructure, talk to your local council and see if you can do some shadowing in the transport or housing team

I'd also suggest being a student rep, if your uni has them. Policy jobs often involve being in a room with very senior people and holding your own, being a rep will give you great experience of doing this and really help you stand out in interviews.

Further, your example isn't exactly right either. Consider an investment that has a 99% probability of returning 4%, with a 1% probability of failing. Alternatively, an investment with 98% probability of returning 7%, with a 1% probability of failing. The expected value of the first is (99x4+1x(-100))/100 which is 2.96%. The second has an expected value of (98x7+2x(-100))/100 which is 4.86%. You then have to consider personal attachment to security.

Do you know him personally? Jose plays whoever that is playing well in that moment. Touch wood, it doesn't ever happen. But, if a player like Hazard turns to rubbish Jose would definitely bench him. The man loves winning more than anything. Why would he jeopardize the chances of us wining just to field a player you think he loves more than Remy? One of the very reason, he is very much loved by the vast majority of his players (former or present) is because he is fair. Falcao would never be an automatic 2nd choice just because he is Falcao. If he ever plays terrible, he would be on the bench. And, if shockingly he plays better than Remy then he can take that spot. Big managers and clubs don't guarantee a spot in the starting 11. You have to earn it. If Remy ever leaves then we would sign another player to replace him. There is no way we will only have two strikers.

That is on offer at the moment but whatever. There is approximately 19 or 20 biscuits in 1 of those packs (332 grams divided by 16.7 grams equals 19.8).

£1 per packet.

12,000 packets.

240,000 individual biscuits.

19,920,000 total kcals.

3,984,000 grams or 3,984 kilograms.

Apparently an average car is 1,500 kilograms. So over twice as many average cars in weight.

That's a lot of biscuits. You could also do the maths with a much cheaper brand of biscuits and end up with much higher numbers. So lets do that!

The cheapest pack of biscuits on Tesco's website is the ""Tesco Everyday Value Rich Tea"". A 300 gram packet for 23 pence. Approx 31 biscuits per packet (300 grams divided by 9.5 grams equals 31.5).

£0.23 per packet.

52,173 packets.

1,617,363 individual biscuits.

69,546,609 total kcals.

15,364,948.5 grams or 15,364 kilograms.

Its not clear that all those who go abroad even hold coherent views beyond being young men looking for excitement.

&gt;I mean there must be some if not more who are not quite as far as ""lets go to war right now"" but are somewhere towards the mid ground. 

The mid ground is dislike of ISIS for non standard reasons.

Look your average music radical seems to work from the basis that the west is doing a lot of bad things and a hypothetical Muslim state would do much better. As soon as the state stops being hypothetical (ISIS, al shabaab at its peak) they find a bunch of reasons to criticise it as well.

My only other feedback is that I feel clicking on the helmet name should take you to the SHARP page. It took me a minute to realise the helmet icon was clickable. That's probably more of a design decision, though.

If the UK population rises then more people need to travel to work, so traffic jams are more likely because there are more cars on the road. It's simple logic.

Let's take London as an example. There's approx 8 million people living here, and if we say that about 25% of them take the train or other public transport to work (a very conservative figure) that's 2 million people per day.

Now let's increase the population to 9 million. The result is 2.25 million people traveling on trains which is an increase of 250,000 or half a million people when accounting for the return journey. How on earth do you plan for an extra 250,000 people using rush hour trains twice a day?

To pick a college, I'd recommend (if at all practical) to come to Cambridge for a day and wander around different colleges to get a feel. The ideal time would be during a university-wide open day (these happen in the next couple of months - all colleges open doors and give tours to students. Admissions people will also be around to answer questions) but if you can't make it then come along anyways. If you can't make it to Cambridge then don't worry - there are plenty of people around to give you suggestions. Do you have any idea what you might be looking for? Big/small, old/modern, Central/quieter? A college like Kings (large, rich, grand, touristy) will be very different to peterhouse (small, cosier, probably friendlier). Remember that all teaching is done outside of college but your college tends to shape your social life in cambridge.

Your second source shows that France's economy dropped much less sharply than the UK's did... in 2008/09. So that also says nothing about conservative policy since they weren't in power yet.



&gt;&gt;So what are you really suggesting? To achieve the same deficit reduction, let alone better results, without austerity would have required very substantial growth rates.

&gt;Not especially, an annual increase of around 2.5% (which is only a little above the average growth of the UK economy for the past 30 years and about what it is doing now) in 2010 - 2013 combined with little to no additional spending by government could have largely wiped out the deficit.

I understand the principle of compound growth. But you're going to have to show me some serious maths to convince me that an extra 0.5% annual growth would have wiped out our £100billion+ deficit in the space of 3 or 4 years.

&gt; Over the long term since the recession, the UK has performed worse than pretty much all developed countries other than Italy. 

This simply isn't true. Of course there are plenty of Guardian articles explaining how by some particular measures we're somehow worse off than Greece or Ireland or Portugal or Spain etc etc. But the yield on 10 year UK Gilts is still around 2%.

I often talk about it, so I'll just briefly skim through why I like it so much.

The first scene, as the Doctor and Rose step out the TARDIS, really touches me. It didn't have the same effect when I watched it fir the first time but watching it know, with all the mountains and mountains if Doctor Who knowledge that clogs up my mind, it really is special. Not only does it connect the new show to the old one really quite nicely, you get a real sense of just how lonely the Doctor is; he even misses the Cybermen.

Van Statten, to me, isn't cartoonishly evil. He is a businessman who sees not only alien salvage as objects but he sees aliens themselves as objects, ones that should be catalogued and displayed. And at times, he sees his employees as objects. 
He wants to 'touch the stars', but he goes about it in a different way to what the Doctor does. You can see that he has a thirst for knowledge, knowledge that he will use to further the advancement of humanity. 
I don't see him as a black and white baddie, I see very few characters in Doctor Who like that, but rather he is in that morally grey area that so many characters do, even the Doctor himself 

The Doctor probably doesn't fully convince Van Statten that he is a master of alien technology, but the mere fact he is able to use the flute proves that he has some degree of knowledge about it. And there are probably few people at Van Statten's disposal that would seem to be as adept as the Doctor was. Moreover, Can Statten is a show-off, and a show-off with a collection not many people can see. So that is why he brings the Doctor to see the Metaltron.

And of course I love the Last Dalek and the Ninth Doctor facing off in that dialogue. I talked about very recently, however, so I won't repeat myself.

To be fair to the people who fought the Dalek, there was little they could really do. There wouldn't have been a huge number of guards in the facility, and they were lead by *that* guy. There wasn't much cover in the corridor and there wasn't even that much cover in the more open area. And the rest of the fighters are untrained. 
Furthermore, the Dalek killing those nameless guards was important for the Dalek's image to the audience. They had started off as an alien that terrorised the imaginations of children and adults of the 1960s, but by the end of Doctor Who's original run in 1989, they seemed to have lost something. And certainly by 2005, they were no longer the fear striking entity they had been. But *Dalek* made the Daleks scary. One Dalek killed people, and one Dalek killed a lot of people. The Daleks were back. (They might have quickly lost that fear but we'll brush over that for now)

Diana Goddard is also my favourite minor character. She is someone I would really want to she reappear in some medium. It wouldn't have to be Doctor Who, it could be in Torchwood or another spin-off. Sure, I like to make up my own stories about what happened to her when she inherited the Van Statten collection, but I would also live to see her interact with more of the Doctor Who universe.

I could talk about Adam, but I'll save that fir another day.



Overall, *Dalek* is one of my favourite episodes, without even a shadow of a doubt, and I suspect it will remain so.",null,0,null,1434760087,null,0,false,0,cscgddo,null,t3_3ag77y,null,t1_cscgddo,null,t3_3ag77y,null,null,null,1437204528,null,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4,null

null,false,ukhobfairthrowaway,null,null,null,"I was running on set for a while, and worked in a few departments trying to find out what I wanted to do. I got chatting to some DPs and 1st ACs and did some camera trainee work, but found it all a bit too political for me really. I kept Running on set (mainly commercials) and also 3rd AD'd some too. After a while working/helping out in almost every department (as Runners end up doing) I basically went to a gaffer and told him I wanted to be a Spark and asked him to take me on as a trainee. Trainee Sparks don't really exist, but sometimes a company asks the gaffer to use one to save on budget. He got me on a job or two and I spoke to the companies who I was working for and told them I wanted to work in lighting and asked if they could help me out. They started booking me in as a Spark Trainee and it grew from there. I learnt everything just working on set. Getting an electrical qualification (I have none) is a bit useless as it doesn't teach you the practical aspects of lighting for TV/Film (making frames, cutting gels, etc) and you just learn that on set. 

I then got a job at a lighting company by walking in and asking to help them out. They paid me like £70 a day and I did pick-ups, drop-offs, and a lot of different jobs with them. They also booked me in on set as Spark Trainee and I got even more experience with people thinking I was just a Spark, and not necessarily knowing my background. Going on set and having people assume you're a fully trained Spark gives you confidence that you never really have when everyone knows you're a trainee.

My advice would generally be to find a department and aim to get in there ASAP. Don't be afraid to ask people if they're willing to have you as a trainee, and take emails and numbers from callsheets and chase these things up. I would say choose your department wisely though, as once you're in one it can be hard to leave as you'll be taking a step-back to the bottom of the ladder.",null,0,null,1434760222,null,0,false,0,cscgf49,null,t3_3aarrh,null,t1_cscgf49,null,t1_csbl93f,null,null,null,1437204548,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

60% would never, under any circumstances attack Iran even if building nuclear weapons.


So that all seems like a concern to me. You can't even say that those polls are unrepresentative when they are taken from different ages, social backgrounds, gender and location, following all polling regulations and is carried out by a respected polling institute.
Also this is one of the more lenient polls carried out.

[Here's one specifically relating to ISIS carried out across Europe](http://www.icmunlimited.com/data/media/pdf/New-EU-Comb.pdf) that shows 7% of Britain being somewhat or very favourable towards ISIS.

We also have Can, Henderson, Milner and Lucas fighting for 2 spots below them.

That add's another player (7 total) fighting for 3 spots.

I get injuries happen during the season but we have AM depth (Origi/Ibe and even Milner can wing). From what everyone says here this kid is class and could be a real benefit to the team but I just don't understand why we need more midfield. We already have so much young talent that need to play.

http://www.batleynews.co.uk/news/local/teen-rape-hotel-in-batley-faces-licence-review-1-5763410

&gt;Police reports said hotel owner Nazir Hussain allowed Asian men to book rooms for an afternoon, and their booking was erased from the hotel’s paper ledger after their departure


You say:

&gt;Actually this is mainly in areas affected by poverty rather than among the richer areas since richer Muslims tend to ""move out"" just like richer White people did from Council Estates. 

Almost as if when you move into non-Muslim areas you leave a toxic sexist echo chamber.

&gt;I literally think cops who had problems with racism suddenly had consequences for their racism and so didn't do their job because they feared being racist when they should have done their job.

You don't have to be a racist to be worried about looking racist, and that's the problem. I don't think a social worker shut up and sent for diversity training for bringing up what's going on is necessarily racist. I watched as much as I could find on YouTube of the secret recordings that got Nick Griffin charged with inciting racial hatred and he talks is about the grooming gang issue, years before the media did. It's like 'Muslamic ray guns'. What happens when you suppress honest discussion is that only the proud racists are left talking about it, and that in turn colours the whole debate. If you brought it up you sounded like Nick Griffin or an EDL thug, and who wanted that?

As if it isn't hard enough that police don't understand what's going on with crimes between Asians, there's this discussing sexual abuse of Pakistanis by Pakistanis: http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/29/-sp-untold-story-culture-of-shame-ruzwana-bashir. Notice that she puts a bunch of it on 'deeply entrenched cultural taboos' and 'wall of silence that perpetuates further abuse', not just on a (justifiable) lack of faith in the police.

There's something seriously rotten going on here and putting it all on the authorities isn't the answer. When that guy whose daughters joined ISIS got a bunch of airtime he used it to blame the authorities and say he didn't know how his own kids were radicalised, but then there he is, in a photo from a few years back at one of Choudry's flag burnings. Whites are getting way too much blame without concessions that Pakistanis simply aren't taking responsibilty nearly enough.

And I'm seeing the same thing in your posts. You say if it's a community problem, that whites didn't do enough to economically integrate them, not that there shouldn't be a problem like that in the community in the first place. You say taking them out of poverty stops them from abusing, as though that doesn't also bring take them out of their culture. You say that if police didn't want to look racist it's because they actually *are* racist and then got called on it and didn't do their jobs. *You say Pakistanis did speak up, and yet there's Pakistanis--women, of course--saying that it's pretty much part of their culture not to*. You say if Asians don't want to report Asian crimes against whites it's because police aren't Asian enough understand what's going on in crimes between Asians, so they're soured on the police. Sorry that they've been fucking useless for your family but I don't think that believing the police lack the cultural understanding to help in crimes within one's own community prevent one from reporting gangs grooming girls of another community.

So it's not just the authorities that have failed, and to the extent that they have, you have to ask *why*. Part of it is this climate in which it's racist not to see the bigger picture of culture and sexism (http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/27/race-rotherham-abuse-scandal-pakistani-community). But then you think it's unfair that Saville is treated as an individual and not as a representative. What's the widest group you think Saville represents, and how are you going to make the analogy between it and Pakistani Muslims? You've got to prove the disproportionate number of perpetrators vis-a-vis a wider population, predatory behaviour against another group (Pakistanis are abusing Pakistanis but the actual grooming *gangs* have almost entirely white victims), and subcultural attitudes within it that make up that 'wall of silence'. Or conversely, you could define the smallest group the Pakistani abusers (and those who knew about it) belong to that has all these attributes, and give reasons not to enlarge it. Don't forget you've got to include some *Pakistani hotel owners* in it, so don't think you can just argue poverty.",null,0,null,1434762280,null,0,1434764019,0,cschdx1,null,t3_3a5gae,null,t1_cschdx1,null,t1_csb88hr,null,null,null,1437204986,null,1,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,1,null

&gt;&gt;just so everyone is aware if Cech goes to Arsenal every other team has to play against him too. It's in no way a disadvantage towards Chelsea.

&gt;Is just plain wrong, just because he deserves to go where he wants, doesn't mean its not a disadvantage to be strengthening a direct rival.

That wasn't the point that was made. It's not a disadvantage because everyone else has to play against him as well. This ""direct rival"" is nonsense. They are just a team we have to play. Winning or losing to them is the worth the same as every other team. It's not like Arsenal has been lacking in the goal keeper position anyway. It won't change much at all. 

&gt;If you made a thread saying cech deserves to go where he wants most people here would agree, but you simply said giving cech arsenal cannot work against us because arsenal play every team, which is precisely why it works against us.

How so? He will take away points from other major teams. Say City plays Arsenal and Cech saves the day and keeps the game 1-1. He just helped us take away 2 points from City. He will equally cause havoc to every team. We how ever have a team I believe can score on him. And a defense that can keep people from scoring on us. 

&gt;Nice thoughts and self motivational shit doesn't change the fact that giving a world class keeper to a direct rival is in no way working in our favor but only against us.

It has positives and negatives.  Not seeing them all is most peoples issue with this transfer.

Does this mean that there is a conspiracy of silence? No. It just means the UK doesn't have an extradition law.

Are you daft. Muslim ""areas"" were the UK's old Industrial Area's. WHITE people there are fucking crazy poor too and more likely to be poorly educated and disillusioned too. What? White people are the only ones who can have reasons for their anger? Brown people simply are mad because they have stupid religions? Don't be daft. Hell? You used Rotherham Right? Once home to our Steel and Iron mills. Muslims were the Night Shift workers.

Actually? Nick Griffith's BNP were advocating violence. And those EDL you mention were happily smashing up stores owned by Patels who are most definitely NOT Muslims on accounts of being fucking Hindu which is as far the fuck away from Islam as possible on account of being a religion completely unrelated to Abraham. 

Do you know what the wall of shame regarding abuse is? That when Indians and Pakistanis first came out about abuse, the fear was that they would lose face. Virginity was still highly valued among them and so any abuse that came to light was dooming someone to never get a normal life. It was also deeply shameful so they would simply cover up abuse and STOP it in house. However I don't think this is healthy and I actually think we should be more candid about the abuse in our lives so we can stop it. 

FYI? It was in White People's Culture not to speak up too. The majority of rapes aren't reported for the same reason. 

Put it this way. If you ever read a ""Paedophile Ring of Hundreds"" the majority are white men. We never bring up race, religion or ethnicity then. Online Paedo's and the more technologically savvy are more likely to be White Men. Yet we never suggest that these men are anything BUT paedophiles. 

The actual grooming gangs may have a fair few Pakistani victims. In fact if we take into account how the UK treated my aunt who was a victim of sexual and physical abuse from her husband (remember, Marital Rape wasn't illegal until 1991) the UK actually had no law to protect her. Many women who were targetted by these were initially poorly educated and often didn't speak English. Blame racism, Pakistani Men couldn't find wives in the UK and were more likely to go back home. The UK desperate to keep workers allowed their wives to come back with them. These women didn't have educations on the basis of they came from freaking Pakistan in the 50's and no one had any education back then because the UK didn't exactly build schools for poor people during the Raj.

Furthermore, there's this sort of caste (not class) system where you're treated like an idiot, and doctors are seen as untouchable gods who shalt not be questioned as they possess all knowledge. I am not a hypochondriac, but I like to be able to rule out the worst case scenario whenever reasonably possible. And to be honest, I know my own body far better than doctors *think* they know mine. If I have an issue, I expect you to listen to it, draw up a shortlist of possible conditions, rule out the worst (ie: MRI/bloodwork if it's remotely suspected to be serious) then treat me accordingly/or not at all. 

Doctors in Australia are far more helpful - whilst I rarely have to pay out of pocket, it's based on demand&amp;supply where doctors get paid on a freelance basis (almost) based on the number of patients they see and the amount of referrals I make. I can call them and get an appointment that day, get a referral to see the clinic the day after (2 days at worst) and get immediate feedback. Taxes pay for for medicare which covers the basics, and you can pay for medibank private which covers extra stuff such as physiotherapy or elective/non-life saving surgery. You get given a debit card and it'll take care of the rest for you. Sometimes you may have to pay up to $30 for a gap, but that's pretty rare. It combines the fairness of the UK system with the accountability and speed of the american system.

I'm pretty level headed, but reading this makes me so angry. There should be reform to the NHS where doctors can be reviewed by patients on their responsiveness to their concerns and whether the doctor's advice actually got them better.

null,false,thatevilvoice2,null,null,null,"&gt;Your first source shows that this recession - brought on by an unprecedented global economic crisis - was worse than the recessions in the 70s and 90s. 

It shows that the recovery, you know that thing that you've been praising the government over, is the weakest the UK has seen in over 100 years, including the great depression. I never said anything about conservative policy having an affect on the size of the recession (though they did go along with many of labour's policies of deregulation of banks leaving them vulnerable and  Osborne himself pledged to match Labour's spending plans as late as 2007).

&gt;Your second source shows that France's economy dropped much less sharply than the UK's did... in 2008/09. So that also says nothing about conservative policy since they weren't in power yet.

Once again this isn't the point I'm making, France's recovery has been weak,  but it wasn't so harshly affected by the recession so the weakness isn't quite so bad. The UK by comparison was hit very hard, hasn't been dragged by the Euro and still some how performed very weakly.

&gt;I understand the principle of compound growth. But you're going to have to show me some serious maths to convince me that an extra 0.5% annual growth would have wiped out our £100billion+ deficit in the space of 3 or 4 years.

I had a go at fully going through this but I ended up throwing my hands up in the air due to difficulties such as inconsistencies between datasets and high inflation.

&gt;This simply isn't true. Of course there are plenty of Guardian articles explaining how by some particular measures we're somehow worse off than Greece or Ireland or Portugal or Spain etc etc. But the yield on 10 year UK Gilts is still around 2%.

Yes sorry, I meant large and developed economies. Obviously we are coping better than countries such as Greece or Spain but the difficulties facing these countries have been significantly different to that of the UK.

And those EDL you mention were happily smashing up stores owned by Patels who are most definitely NOT Muslims on accounts of being fucking Hindu which is as far the fuck away from Islam as possible on account of being a religion completely unrelated to Abraham. 

Are *you* completely 'daft', 'mate'? Why do you think I said no one wants to sound like Nick Griffin or the EDL? Isn't it because they're violent racist idiots? And if years ago only violent racist idiots were saying something that *now* I can read in the Guardian, the public debate about this was completely messed up. How can you miss the point so badly?

&gt;Are you daft. Muslim ""areas"" were the UK's old Industrial Area's. WHITE people there are fucking crazy poor too and more likely to be poorly educated and disillusioned too.

White people poorly educated and disillusioned... *and they formed rape gangs in broad view*? No, they didn't. Muslims getting rich didn't just leave behind poor education and disillusionment, they left behind their own culture, or we'd be seeing white rape gangs operating in full view in towns all over the north. You prove my point.

&gt;The Owners Deny Any Wrong Doings. 

What the fuck did you expect?? How many of the abusers themselves pled guilty?? The abusers were yelling in court that their victims were lying whores. Then they do a couple of years in jail and high-tail it to Pakistan and tweet about living 'the high life'. A pervasive pattern of total denial and unrepentance.

&gt; FYI? It was in White People's Culture not to speak up too. The majority of rapes aren't reported for the same reason.

Victims not reporting rape (as in your Indian example) is very different from people knowing gang rape is going on amongst their friends and coworkers and not reporting it. And as an aside, it's patently *not* the same reason because among whites a girl losing her virginity outside of marriage doesn't doom them to never having 'a normal life'.

&gt;The actual grooming gangs may have a fair few Pakistani victims.

Gang members would specifically ask white girls to find more white girls and use their race in slurs against them. There is an undeniable racial component to it.

&gt;If you ever read a ""Paedophile Ring of Hundreds"" the majority are white men. We never bring up race, religion or ethnicity then. Online Paedo's and the more technologically savvy are more likely to be White Men. Yet we never suggest that these men are anything BUT paedophiles. 

*Where is the white wall of silence that protects them?* It's a network of secretive pedos because they know white people would bash their skulls in if they were even half as brazen as Pakistani abusers have been. How many times do I have to repeat this for you to even attempt to answer it?:

&gt;What's the widest group you think Saville represents, and how are you going to make the analogy between it and Pakistani Muslims? You've got to prove the disproportionate number of perpetrators vis-a-vis a wider population, predatory behaviour against another group (Pakistanis are abusing Pakistanis but the actual grooming gangs have almost entirely white victims), and subcultural attitudes within it that make up that 'wall of silence'.

null,false,havfunonline,null,null,null,"Retirement savings usually take the form of a private pension, which is a set of money that your employer will contribute towards (usually around 5% of your income) and you can make voluntary contributions towards.

Because this money has tax relief, you will be unable to access it at all until you retire. It if invested by a separate company, which will be organised by your employer.

What you do with that money when you hit retirement is more complicated - but it's better to speak to a financial advisor about that sort of thing!

In terms of banks, the best thing to do is look at what they're offering that matches up with what you need. Many banks offer an ultimate reward current account, which you pay £10-£15 a month for, but will give you phone insurance and breakdown cover.

Other things to mention:

Cars are insured to a driver, not a car. The UK driving test is pretty tough.

You'll want to read up on what an ISA is - they're great for medium term saving.

You'll need to pay council tax wherever you live (this is the responsibility of the renter, not the landlord), and road tax if you have a car. This can now be done, very easily on line on the direct.gov website.

If you're a salaried employee then you won't need to fill out a tax return usually- your employer will simply deduct the tax money directly from your pay.

The next day, they were split into two teams with coloured bibs and the the change was immediate with how they interacted with each other and as a group as a whole. Even sitting down for lunch, they would sit at separate tables.

There were two people who were separated into groups but they wanted to continue their friendship during the activities' breaks, but their groups wouldn't allow them to and I think it got quite stressful for them and the girl may even have cried.

If you made murder legal, of course that wouldn't solve the murder problem. Likewise if you made drugs legal of course people will still take drugs. But:

- drug related crime would disappear if addictive drugs like heroin were given on the NHS
- money would go to taxes not gangs
- prisons wouldn't be filled with people who weren't hurting anyone else
- criminals would lose the financial incentive to push people towards harder drugs
- hard drugs would be purer and more consistent, which means fewer people would overdose or die from the long term health problems posed by contaminants.

Eligibility for social security benefits in many advanced economies is dependent on unemployed and underemployed people carrying out an expanding range of job search, training and work preparation activities, as well as mandatory unpaid labour (workfare). 

Increasingly, these activities include interventions intended to modify attitudes, beliefs and personality, notably through the imposition of positive affect. Labour on the self in order to achieve characteristics said to increase employability is now widely promoted. This work and the discourse on it are central to the experience of many claimants and contribute to the view that unemployment is evidence of both personal failure and psychological deficit. The use of psychology in the delivery of workfare functions to erase the experience and effects of social and economic inequalities, to construct a psychological ideal that links unemployment to psychological deficit, and so to authorise the extension of state—and state-contracted—surveillance to psychological characteristics. 

This paper describes the coercive and punitive nature of many psycho-policy interventions and considers the implications of psycho-policy for the disadvantaged and excluded populations who are its primary targets. We draw on personal testimonies of people experiencing workfare, policy analysis and social media records of campaigns opposed to workfare in order to explore the extent of psycho-compulsion in workfare. This is an area that has received little attention in the academic literature but that raises issues of ethics and professional accountability and challenges the field of medical humanities to reflect more critically on its relationship to psychology.

My life's great. I'm getting married soon, I live a frugal but comfortable life, and I'm on the road to achieving my ambitions. Sometimes I take drugs, and have a great time with my friends, and they give me new and interesting experiences. I'm careful and take whatever steps I can to manage the potential risks, and I don't pose a risk to anyone else. Oddly enough, I don't think it would be very just if I were put in prison for doing this, if we claim to live in a liberal country where people are free to make their own decisions about how they live.

Do you really believe the narrative that anyone who takes drugs is using them because of some deep trauma and not just because it's enjoyable and often even personally meaningful? Does everyone who drinks do so because there's something wrong in their life? Or is it the case that for most people, drinking is positive, social, and enjoyable, and only a serious problem for a small portion of drinkers?

null,false,MrFlabulous,,Glorious People's Republic Of Asbostan,null,"Happy to oblige. It may also help to give you some backstory as well: until recently I was living abroad with my wife - we had to move when our jobs in the UK disappeared.

I'm a research scientist by trade. I've spent many years working in both Big Pharma and academia. In both parts of the industry there is a huge reliance on collaborations, visiting workers and so on. Many of the researchers I've worked with both at Big Pharma and Imperial College London came from abroad, many through EU grants but some were not EU, and they also made fine scientists. So as far as I'm concerned having a broad spectrum of ethnicities is a huge benefit to research not just in the UK but globally. I've learned many, many things from all of these guys and without foreign researchers I think science in the UK would have stalled a long time ago.

At a social level it does become more complex. The benefits of multiculturalism are very hard to pin down, sure. But on a personal level there is this: having lived abroad I had to adapt and fit in. It was hard; at the age of 37 I suddenly had to learn a new language and adopt a new culture. I found it extremely difficult at times as the new country was a lot less helpful than I'd been led to believe. The job centre and DSS were unwilling to help me out and I was unemployed for a good 2 years despite numerous applications and interviews. I ended up having to do unpaid work for a while just to get my foot in the door and was finally employed on a temporary contract, which fortunately was a rolling one.

I finally moved back to the UK earlier this year, my wife is still abroad but will thankfully be joining me next month. I can say that during my brief contract abroad I was able to make some decent contributions to the company I worked for ( a couple of small publications, a key milestone for a new drug, another decision to halt fruitless research. Minor things for many but important for the business) because as a foreign worker I was able to do things that the ""natives"" hadn't thought to do. Still, they refused to accept me and I ended up feeling very unhappy and isolated. An outcast, so I was very happy to return to the UK.

The country in question was Sweden: fabulous multiculti Sweden. I made every, I repeat *every* effort to fit in, including paying a large amount of money through their open university system to improve my Swedish language (it worked, I ended up with pretty good Swedish compared to other immigrants but a rising debt in the process) and contributed all I could to the society, but still couldn't make it there.

Bit wordy but here's the thing: a properly multicultural society would have offered more help to me: I had something to give them, the benefits of my experience and skills, and paid my taxes like a good person. Yet when I really needed help I received none. At my lowest point having been turned down for yet another job I asked my wife: should I change my name to something a little more scandinavian? She said ""probably.""

Yet if you call a Swede a racist they will deny it fervently, and probably become quite angry.  I honestly feel that rather than hiring the best person for the jobs I applied for they passed this over in favour of a Swede. Partly because the company that did eventually offer me a contract had turned me down a year previously and they guy who did get that position was, well, not incompetent but not exactly setting the world on fire.

So I guess I've actually seen the good side and the bad side. I understand the need for immigrants to have useful skills, and would concede that it is better to accept immigrants who can contribute. However I'm also a humanitarian. People who flee dreadful regimes, people who have lost everything, people who just want a better life than the one they had: they have swallowed their pride and admitted that their homeland holds nothing for them. It feels very wrong to me to turn people away based on where they come from or their reasons for coming, and most of them want to contribute to a new society in exchange for the chance to live there. They are not all benefit cheats, and in fact the net contribution far outweighs the cost of housing them.

I guess the best example of multiculturalism working is to look at the development of the USA from the early 1900s. Now they are the most powerful nation on the planet, and they are a nation of immigrants. It's not the variety of food that made them great, it's the contributions that their people made, most of them from abroad. Some of their most brilliant minds weren't born in the USA, but they are accepted as American regardless of their surname, accent, and colour of their skin (mostly).

It worked because at the time they were progressive and adaptable. Now sadly they are very conservative in outlook and the rest of the world perceives them as being slack-jawed gun-toting yokels. And as for the UK...

Another essay. Yikes. I should get out more. So I feel that science and technology benefits hugely from immigrants. If we had better manufacturing we would get more from unskilled immigrants, but now there are so few factories that employ unskilled labourers that the jobs just aren't there. We can thank the last 30 years of misgovernment for that, but that's something else entirely. Anyway, multiculturalism can work, but it needs a more progressive line of thought. What it doesn't need is certain sections of the media shrieking insanely with headlines about foreign benefit cheats - it's not news, it's the views of newspaper barons and their efforts to push their own agenda.

I know many of the arguments against multiculturalism: not enough resources, no jobs, homes etc. Pushing down the wages. Yup. But those arguments are no stronger than your food / curry one. We could provide jobs. We could build homes. Instead the major employers outsource stuff mecause it's cheaper to do so - they'd rather have a call centre in Bangladesh. They'd rather import cheap clothing from China. They'd rather build cars in Vietnam. It saves them money and allows them to pay their shareholders better dividends. Even that Dyson twat, the one that designed those excellent hoovers, he won't build them in the UK. But he could, and in so doing provide jobs for unskilled workers.

Look at Pakistan. How do you think Bin Laden hid in a fortified compound for so long without the government detecting him? There were certainly people in the ISI that knew where he was, and it's not unreasonable to think that some in the military would also have found out due to its close proximity to a military base and the village itself being inhabited by ex-soldiers. 

Why did they not tell their superiors? Because they sympathised with Al Qaeda. They may not be card-carrying members, but they were still helping a terror group.

How about the towns that ISIS conquered in Syria and Iraq? Most of them are Sunni majority. In some cases the towns have welcomed the militants in and not bothered to put up a fight because they sympathise with the B'aathists and the Sunni militia's that ISIS is made up of.  ISIS would never be able to take Southern Iraq because the Shiite militia's there would just kill them all no questions asked. 

The last thing we need is people in positions of power that sympathise with religious extremists. We don't want extremists running our schools, or our civil service, or our government. And we certainly don't want useful idiots turning a blind-eye to extremism happening under their noses because of some idiotic idea that Islamic extremism is actually a valid movement that we should accommodate.

The Telegraph is the only paper in this country that criticizes Islam in a sensible way (which they were rewarded for by being called Islamophobic by the rest of the press, see the coverage of the Trojan Horse scandal before Ofsted's report came out).

http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/factcheck-grooming-gangs/18739

&gt;Of 52 groups where ethnicity data was provided, 26 (50 per cent) comprised all Asian offenders, 11 (21 per cent) were all white, 9 (17 per cent) groups had offenders from multiple ethnicities, 4 (8 per cent) were all black offenders and there were 2 (4 per cent) exclusively Arab groups.

&gt;Of the 306 offenders whose ethnicity was noted, 75 per cent were categorised as Asian, 17 per cent white, and the remaining 8 per cent black (5 per cent) or Arab (3 per cent).

&gt;By contrast, the seven “Type 2 groups” – paedophile rings rather than grooming gangs – “were reported as exclusively of white ethnicity”.

&gt;So-called “Type 2″ groups – where the offenders have a long-standing sexual interest in children, were much less common. Only seven known or suspected paedophile rings were reported to Ceop.

And the conspiracy of silence in the community:

Historic? What historic examples? I should point out when it comes to population changes, you need to look at a period more than a couple of decades, in fact you have to measure more than one generation, perhaps more than two generations to actually get even a slightly clear picture.

EDIT: For that matter, you are assuming that everyone in this country will stay Muslim. There is simply not enough data to actually extrapolate towards any long-term trend (no, there simply isn't, when the average human life span is 75-80 years, any measures over a period shorter than that is only really measuring a 1 or 2 generations of people). I'm deliberately trying to skirt round the fact that you seem to be conflating Asians with Muslims as if the two are intrinsically connected and that some of them don't convert or lose their faith. Not to mention the map doesn't specify whether we are talking Pakistani Asians (which would likely be Muslim), Indian and central Asians (which would be a mixture of Muslim, Sikh, Hindu, Buddhism etc.), or East Asian (whose religious affiliations would be an incredibly wide bucket)",null,0,null,1434792037,null,0,1434792727,0,cscrnfa,null,t3_3ahseh,null,t1_cscrnfa,null,t1_cscrkp8,null,null,null,1437545097,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null
