Who covered up? The Police? It wasn't the Pakistani or Asian communities. 

Incidentally? You are aware the Pakistani community probably has a tonne of victims too who simply aren't coming forward due to the stigma of rape within their community.

I bet it isn't endemic. I bet that what you have is a media system that's portraying it as endemic cause it gets people talking. What the issue is that the police were simply inept and unwilling to deal with the local community. It allowed paedophiles to create rings, get together and abuse victims with impunity in the same way that the Catholic Church protected their paedophiles.

If this is the case, it would seem that it isn't widely known by timelords in general, and may be known only by the Doctor and the Master.

And it would seem particularly odd for that knowledge to be so limited, especially since the elder gods of the pre-universe, as well as the original vampires and Fendahl would have been in a position to know that sort of thing.

Fact of the matter is, it's entirely possible that this could be revealed to be the case, then later get thoroughly and irrefutably disproven, and then later get revealed again. Many of the series writers flatly reject the idea of an irreconcilable contradiction in the Whoniverse. In fact, some of them enjoy the challenge of taking two clearly contradictory facts, then stitching them together with an internally consistent justification.

Anything that engages the fans and brings in new ones is a good thing. I think that the Fan Show’s mission is to reach out to specific demographics and fans/fan groups. Why not use all available forms of social media to grow the fan base and to let it participate in the show? It’s important to bring new younger viewers into the show, recognize existing viewers, and encourage fan interaction with DW.

I think it is pretty clever marketing/PR and will help the show’s longevity. If it’s not to someone’s taste (wrong age range or other demographic dynamic), there are a lot of other DW fan shows and films out there to watch.

I'm not sure that's true.  *Marching* hasn't worked, but I feel that history has a pretty inaccurate view of previous peaceful protests.

It's easy enough to think of the civil rights movement in America as a load of black people marching, but that overlooks the carefully orchestrated legal challenges that led to change.  Marching showed popular support, but Rosa Parks was carefully chosen by the movement in order to challenge the law.  Similarly, Gandhi didn't politely ask the British to leave.  Non-cooperation involved stopping work and boycotting. 

Peaceful protest hasn't worked *yet*.  But it may simply be that we haven't found the right method.  Peaceful protest requires work.  It requires an achievable goal.

As is, MI5 and GCHQ **do not** need a court order to access your data. They can just look at it. It might be unlawful, but 'who is watching the watchers'? Obviously, if they want to bring a conviction, they need to determine the legitimate path of obtaining the evidence, but if you are encrypted you protect yourself from them just doing a quick check on you.

This isn't to 100% guarantee your data is not breachable (assume it is), but just to give you some armour to make it more costly for you to be snooped on. I mean lets face it, unless you are a member of ISIS or a member of a child pornography ring, you probably aren't worried about being dragged to court to decrypt anything. The most incriminating thing I have is that I am a member of the lib dems, which probably gets me on a black-list or two :p, but I still want to preserve my right to not be snooped on.

But I see it as an act of standing up for rights - our collective rights to privacy are being threatened and so in a way enabling basic encryption is a form of passive resistance. What it does, if we ALL enable encryption, is firstly sends a clear message that we are not okay with being snooped on, and more importantly it just increases the cost for the state to snoop on everyone (at a time when police and intelligence budgets are plummeting). We will therefore create an economic argument, rather than a moral one, to avoid snooping.

&gt;At Sheffield crown court, Umar was jailed for four and a half years in November 2010 for sexual activity with a girl of 13. His sentence was cut to three-and-a-half years and he is now free.

&gt;The other men in the gang were Zafran Ramzan, his cousin Razwan Razaq, Adil Hussain and Mohsin Khan. Ramzan, then 21, was jailed for nine years for raping a 16-year-old girl and two counts of sexual activity with a child.

&gt;Razwan Razaq, 30, was jailed for 11 years, while Hussain, 20, and Mohsin Khan, 21, were sentenced to four years in prison. It is believed only two are still behind bars.

* The QCF level 4 exams are easy with CII, they sit on the difficulty scale somewhere between A levels and the first year of university. They should take around 400 hours of study time, and cost around £1200-1500. Most companies that take on trainees will pay for this study material/ exam costs. You would take 5 multiple choice exams, and one 3 hour exam - [pass rates here](http://www.cii.co.uk/qualifications/assessment-information/pass-rates/). The study material given by the CII is more than adequate to pass the exams. I think you need to complete the Dip 4 qualification in a two year period, so that's something you may need to bear in mind. 

* ATT is for more a more tax heavy role, its not something I've looked at fully. However I haven't seen many IFA's holding this qualification. Some may hold the ACCA qualification (accountants) who have diverted into the IFA industry afterwards. Saying that, the ATT qualification is something I am considering in the next 5 years, but there are many more relevant qualifications on offer that I believe would be more beneficial. I also think you need 2 years relevant work experience to obtain the ATT, and I'm not too sure if the IFA industry counts, again I haven't fully looked into this to find out.

* From a graduate point of view, there are graduate schemes out there that offer a quick way through to an adviser position. St James Place is one of them. Preferences are usually finance, economics, law, maths degrees. However I know someone who got on a graduate scheme with a biomed degree (from a good uni), so the degree doesn't necessarily matter. You should get taught everything you need to know on the job, and the degree becomes slightly irrelevant - I'm sure its just there for namesake when they advertise their IFA's on their website etc! 

* I doubt you will break into an FA role at 18, but there are a few routes that you can get in if you decide against to uni. Look on 'indeed.co.uk' and search for a 'trainee paraplanner/ paraplanning' job. Often you will find they are specifically looking for a graduate, however you may get lucky and find a scheme offered for A level leavers. You also need to bear in mind its quite an 'old' profession, where most advisers are above the age of 40-50 (many have it as a 'second profession'). If you search, you will find that the industry is concerned that there isn't enough ['young blood'](https://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=tax+haven&amp;meta=&amp;gws_rd=ssl#hl=en-GB&amp;q=young+blood+ifa) entering. 

* The more popular option, is working for a bank (tied) as an adviser of sorts. A common path is going to become a mortgage adviser, then move into a adviser role. After a few years (sometimes 5-10) of experience they may shift into the independent sector. So if you have no luck with the above, consider looking for a job with a bank which can lead you into a advising position. Many banks offer A level schemes too. 

My best advice would be to knuckle down this second year of A levels and try to get into a good university. Try your best to  get any kind of work experience in the financial arena, perhaps an IFA firm if you strike lucky. I don't know if many firms however would take someone on for a short week or some placement (due to the sensitive nature of the work), so perhaps a summer internship whilst at university would be a better opportunity.

study into intergenerational transfer found that Britons over the age of 40 have been net beneficiaries from the state, leaving a multi-trillion-pound bill that will have to be picked up by future generations.
**While the average 65-year-old has enjoyed a net £223,183 state subsidy above the tax paid, a new-born child will have to contribute a net £159,668 over their lifetime.**


http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/property/house-prices/10840343/Sorry-baby-boomers-really-did-have-it-all.html


a controversial article published earlier this month, Nigel Wilson, the head of Legal &amp; General, said *baby boomers had ""lived for free"" because the capital gains they made on their homes far outweighed their mortgage interest payments*. Hundreds of readers commented, many pointing out that they'd had to pay interest rates of as much as 15pc and endure periods when house prices fell. Here Mr Wilson responds to those readers.
My generation, according to the Who, ""hoped to die before we got old"". Instead, we scooped the jackpot.
*We benefited from the postwar creation of the NHS and the welfare state, and had free education (no student loans or tuition fees back then*!).
The biggest boost to almost anyone born before 1975 who became an owner-occupier is that *housing was effectively free as capital gains on housing far outstripped the interest costs of a mortgage*. **House prices have risen by 4,300pc over the past 40 years, far outstripping any other necessity**.
Almost every chancellor since 1970 (Barber, Lawson, Brown and now Osborne) has been tempted to use pre-election housing booms to shore up support among owner-occupiers. The ratio of house prices to average earnings reached a peaked under Gordon Brown – and we are now fast approaching that level again.

Sure, we had to save for deposits and endure periods of high mortgage interest rates – remember 15pc under John Major. And some parts of the country, particularly London and the South East, benefited way more than others. But for most of the ""housing haves"" the feel-good factor has been terrific: like owning a lottery ticket that pays out week after week.
*Those of us basking in the warm glow of rising house prices should be aware of two chilling facts. First, the theoretical wealth locked up in housing is economically unproductive. And second, it is the biggest single driver of rising inequality in Britain today*.
It is unproductive ""wealth"" because most of us can't turn it into money. We all have a personal balance sheet which, all being well, grows over our working life and runs down in retirement. For the typical owner-occupier it consists of the right to a state pension, some private pension rights, some savings and a house. We often think of our house as part of our pension, but don't actually use it to provide retirement income.
Home ownership is disproportionately in the hands of the baby-boomer generation: **83pc of over-60s own their own home, and 64pc do so without a mortgage**. This adds up to £1.3 trillion in housing equity. Three-and-a-half million of these older people want to move, but the right housing is not available and they are stuck. Most people talk about first-time buyers. But if we could create the right housing stock – homes providing an attractive lifestyle choice and an enhanced income for the demographic group we call the ""last-time buyer"" – then an extra £400bn could be deployed in the wider economy – investing in future growth and jobs.
Which brings me to inequality: while 3.5 million older people are trapped in homes that no longer suit them, 26pc of those aged 20-34 still live with their parents. Between 1997 and 2010, the average income needed to become a first-time buyer doubled from £20,000 to £40,000, and as many as 90pc of the first-time buyers need support from the ""Bank of Mum and Dad"".
There is epic intergenerational inequality, and housing is central. While my generation has been acquiring housing wealth, we have loaded debt on to the young – and this will have to be repaid. There is now more than £50bn in outstanding student loans, and £1.3 trillion of government debt.
We can't tackle the whole debt legacy in one go – it's hard enough for the Government to reduce its annual £100bn deficit given that we have an ageing population. But we can make inroads into the housing problem that sits at the heart of it.

**Pretend the club has money to spend when it doesn't:** We've got an average net spend of between 30-40m per season under FSG, who have been operating under the assumption that FFP would be enforced, thus making a higher net spend unlikely.

**Make the club sound like its being more proactive:** Again, don't see the need for that; it's not like he's invented stories about us pursuing DM's when we haven't been.

**To hide interest in another player:** It hasn't really panned out that way. Take Lallana, for instance - James Pearce broke the story almost as soon as the season ended. When it looked like the deal wouldn't happen because of Southampton's asking price, there started to be stories about Shaqiri - not because he was the real target and we were hiding interest in him, but as a message to Southampton that we did have alternative targets to Lallana. As soon as Lallana was signed, the Shaqiri links from Pearce stopped.

 Maybe they thought they were being creative and breaking trend from the 10 and 11 regenerations?

I've struggled to find anything to properly clear up my skin as well as benzoyl peroxide (which I stopped using because of safety fears) or Avene Cleanance K (discontinued. Bah).

The SR Skincare 5% Salicylic Toner has cleared up 90% of my acne in 2 weeks and has made my entire complexion smoother and glow-ier.

It's very pungent though! I almost have to hold my breath when applying it around my nose and mouth as it makes me a bit wheezy! I'm applying it with cotton wool pads. I leave it on (I don't neutralise with water as my skin is fairly tolerant) and apply moisturiser almost straight away.

With P&amp;P it costs me £8 a bottle, and I predict will last about 6 weeks.

My only concern would be for those with very sensitive skin, you may find it too irritating, or may have to work up your tolerance to it.

Oh, and the plus side is, because this is such a miracle product for me, I can get away with much cheaper toners/moisturisers/face wash as my skin looks so good!

When white people commit a crime, they are representing themselves. Even when they statistically are more likely to do something than say... British Indians. Like say, getting wankered and wasting NHS money by fighting on the streets on the weekend.

However when a minority does something the entire minority is represented by that one person. 

Jimmy Saville does not represent all white people. These gangs do not represent all Muslims. Do you not understand this basic fucking concept? Must we declare all celebrities (Who were predominantly white men) who are white and male to be banned from all childhood contact? Should we treat Jimmy Carr the same as Jimmy Saville? Or do we recognise that each individual is responsible for their own actions and treat them as individuals. 

Same applies to ""Muslims"". It takes a huge variety of people and boils them down to a single behavioural pattern. 

Want to know something idiotic? Pakistani Muslims are not the Majority of Asians. 

That would be INDIANS. British Indians outnumber them. And their Muslims tend to be more educated and not be like this. You are comparing Prince William to some guy from a housing estate. Religion plays a lot smaller role than economics.

My point being the likes of Pearce are far more reliable that some Italian website farting out a rumour with no cited sources or weight to it. I know people say 'it's the summer', 'what else are we meant to talk about?' but all these baseless rumours are what get everyone around here over-excited, and then spit fury when said player doesn't arrive, it happens over numerous players every transfer period and it makes this sub look naive and uninformed (especially as the serial offenders -yourself included- seem adverse to using the 'rumour' tag.)

I don't think reforming farming will come from people becoming vegan or vegetarian. It needs to come from making farm economically viable at smaller level.

[The average age of the UK farmer is 58, only 3% of farms are run by under people under 35.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17537153) 

Farms aren't attractive careers of young people, long hours, poor pay, high risk, very dependent on external factors foot and mouth, super markets and other contracts for suppliers, even estate owners, a completely personal story, the farm next to where I grew up, the farmer passed away a few years ago quite expectantly , his son 30s who had a good career in the construction industry, wanted to give that up and take over running the farm, the estate said no, it wasn't economically viable, even several years later, after failed planning permission they won't farm the land, and still want to develop housing on it.

The economic rewards of farms have gone down, The average wage for a farm is £24,520, for a farm worker £17,925, under the UK average of £26,500.

This loss of new generation coming into farming will be crippling, we will loose skill and experience without the old generation teaching the new, small scale farms won't be viable, compared to larger producing farms, we will probably import more food as a result without much say or voice in those farming methods.

There's a reason why players go there to end their careers. The money and how easy it is compared to their tougher European leagues. Isn't Bradley Wright Phillips a league one reject one of the best players in the league? I think that says enough really. MLS is a terrible league and it's only semi relevant because of the amount of money they spend on players that are well past it. 

The only player I have an idea of coming from there is that Yedlin fella for Spurs and no one knows how he's gonna turn out. Just cos one or two players are legitimately good doesn't make the rest good. I'm from Ireland and we've had players like Seamus, Shane Long, Roy Keane and Kevin Doyle work their way with the Irish league and move on and be successful in England. Does that mean that I think the league here is any comparison because we developed some good players. God no. The league here is shite in comparison but some players are just better than others. That being said I think of you strip away all the money and work on the same budgets league of Ireland would absolutely hammer MLS and that's saying something.

Nobody has ever said or considered Rusholme a no-go area, despite the presence of the uks first routine armed patrols there. A lot the people there are students, who as you will know are preyed on far more than local populations of immigrant descent are persecuted by racists. That's one of the reasons why they had to set up safe spaces for the students, students get raped there every year, and why home contents and car insurance rates there are through the roof.

Possibly not the best example you could have picked.

So let's talk about apartheid. Clearly, without it SA will be working much better. There will be no persecution of the white minority and no need for them to have safe spaces or leave the country. Shall I have a read and post some links I find or should we just move swiftly on from this example too?

Owens raises points of his political view which hes quite entitled to but that doesn't mean that just because some people don't agree with Carswell's views mean they have carté blanche to assault him.

Jones complains about the ""sweeping generalisations"" of the left spoken by Carswell then goes on to give sweeping generalisations about the right save a few choice personal experiences. 

&gt;No, Carswell should not have been subjected to his upsetting experience. But if he, or anyone else, believes that people are going to stop protesting about the living wage, the housing crisis, workers’ rights, tax justice, public services, climate change, or whatever, then they will be sorely disappointed.

spot on. This is exactly what you can and should do if you dont like the way things are run

&gt;Yes, the left needs a message of hope, of optimism rallying around a coherent alternative that can inspire. But if the likes of Carswell try to smear the left as a whole – well, then we need to speak up.

Indeed they do, but harassment and assault or not what would traditionally be described as ""a message of hope, of optimism rallying around a coherent alternative that can inspire."" unless said message is ""you agree with me or you're wrong and fuck you because of it""

you're right, ""Khorosan"" is supposedly associated with JAN. but to some extent the two groups have been mixed, i think deliberately, by clever PR from the White House.

Yet ""Khorosan"" was introduced to the narrative by the Obama administration as an additional justification right before the bombing campaign starts. Nobody had ever heard of them before.

http://www.defense.gov/Transcripts/Transcript.aspx?TranscriptID=5505

Now remember this was the time where ISIS were beheading journalists and threatening genocide against Yazidis on the mountain,  i.e. already doing some very scary stuff. So it strikes me as odd that the White House would need to embellish anything in order to justify military strikes, make the case for war etc. Yet they did.
The question is - why?

Perhaps because while a lot of what you said is true, i.e. ISIS themselves had built a fairly substantial state, control significant resources, are well-funded etc. , the ISIS crisis was missing one piece of the puzzle - a genuine threat to Western civilians. and without that, the legal and ""propaganda"" case for the war wasn't quite there.

THe FBI said so at the time -&gt; http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/22/fbi-no-credible-threats-to-us-from-islamic-state/

Think about it - if all these ""lone wolf"" guys are doing is picking up an AK47 and wandering into a Western shopping center, why do they need the backing of an entire terrorist state to do that?

I tihnk Khorosan was just a neat way of re-describing elements of JAN / former AQI in a way that made the threat to the West very clear, and justified military intervention. That JAN and ISIS are separate groups, often at war with each other, doesn't really matter. ""Jihadists"" is a catch all word.

I also think that there's a lot more to the Western re-entry into Iraq than meets the eye. Since 2003, Iran controls Baghdad. If Iran can be seen to provide the only realistic buffer to ISIS in the region, via their militias/regular troops/special forces, USA finally loses control of Iraq, which makes the last ten years pretty pointless. Iran is also backing the Kurds, same picture there - Kurdistan is a last bastion of US influence in northern Iraq. Finally you have an American/European interest in securing oil - not production which is fairly weak and low quality across northern Iraq and Syria, where ISIS are dominant, but crucial pipeline infrastructure which needs to be defended at all costs to keep European supplies stable. Finally, it's not inconceivable there could be massive border shifts in the Near East in the next five years. It makes sense for the Americans and Europeans to keep their oar in - otherwise Turkey, Iran, Russia could all clean up, leaving WEst frozen out.

So I think we just need to be realistic about what threat ISIS poses outside of its own immediate borders, and to what extent the administration, foreign policy establishment of the US is using it as a very convenient smokescreen for securing their own interests. To some extent they are hitting a sweetspot, achieving humanitarian goals while securing strategic assets.

Which reminds me of the first words of this terrible song.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtUkbW4a1aY

This is the tune the West sings on ISIS - telling Western citizens they are most at threat, when really its a regional problem.

The Scots clearly  - well hate is too strong a word - but they didn't rate Miliband at all. They didn't want any part of a party he was leading (in contrast to their strong showing in 2010 for Gordon Brown).

No-one knew at the time Miliband was being elected that there would be a Scottish referendum in 2014. It was during the referendum I knew Labour had lost the general election. Miliband was looking less statesmanlike than Cameron and it was clear the Scots had completely dismissed him as a nonentity. He had to have his irons pulled out of the fire by Gordon Brown. And then just after Brown's barnstorming speech came Miliband's lacklustre one to the Labour conference. The contrast was awful.

Yeah and mate, please. Lets have a proper argument about this. I've gone into detail as to why I think their ideological motivations, modus operandi and logistical capacity make them capable and willing of launching attacks through covert and asymetric manners beyond their immiedate boarders to thouse they consider enemies (a long list).

And since we've even *started* this conversation it appaers they are doing just that in Saudi. One of the most locked down controlled and well equipped millitary-policestate-monarchies in human history. A slick operation that takes serious effort and accumen to launch a strike against. 

Now have I ever said, they pose an immediate threat tomorrow? Nope. What I have said is that the capture of Cyrcenia in Libya gives them access to the Mid med migrant route, which is a major poorly policed route of entry into Italty. 

And i've said, yes. If they want to they likely can get enough men and the scant materials necessiary into a major southern european city. 

And this is something I think neither of us 

Hell these guys want 'Rome' aka 'the west' to fight them in a bit of syria because they think it'll cause the mesiah to appear, they even have a publican in english devoted to this. They are Millienarian nutcases.

And Millinerian nutcases with impressive millitary capabilities. 

This Khorosan group thing has been, i'm sorry, a massive red herring on your part. AQ and its affilates are increasingly relatively limited non-state actors. ISIS are orders of magnitude better equipped. They have oil export revenues, cities and armies. 

Your also saying quite often, that *having* armies is actually an impedement. You've not really explained here in material terms how this is so. If anything its actually rare bordering on odd that a group of this size with these capabilities don't have some form of military intelligence service. 

So lets get down to the real bones of concention. Why does the hypothetical i've suggested not work.

Can we all pitch in to beef up the Italian Naval pickets and establish some sort of effective measure of population movement. Because we are a long way off that at the moment.

Personally, I just try to make my language techniques over the top, without fail, every paragraph of mine will have a rhetorical device, alliteration, humour, self-reflection, etc; I think the use of these techniques have helped me to achieve higher grades just because the examiner is more aware that I am using them. I feel that you should do the same just to be sure you hit those top marks.

Additionally, search DAFOREST on Google, it's an acronym for all of the core language techniques you should use to get an A/A* grade - that really helped me out.

Read a few articles before the exam and just take 10-20 minutes to study a few of them. While your response would most likely get you a high mark as it is, the mark scheme is looking for an answer that seems without a doubt written for it's intended purpose. Your response seems perhaps too informal with slightly too many personal opinions. I think that in future responses it would aid you to tackle both sides of the argument in a more formal way.

Honestly I'm nit-picking here, your answer would definitely get a high mark. English Language is really just giving the examiner what they want to hear, and that's all down to how many marks they can award you for each technique used.

Agreed, but it's in the Guardian so that's somewhat to be expected.  It's not like he hides his political leanings.

&gt; Owens raises points of his political view which hes quite entitled to but that doesn't mean that just because some people don't agree with Carswell's views mean they have carté blanche to assault him.

Owens himself says exactly this.  Did we just read the same article?  The first four and penultimate paragraphs are him building up to and saying exactly the same thing.

&gt; Jones complains about the ""sweeping generalisations"" of the left spoken by Carswell then goes on to give *sweeping generalisations* about the right save a few choice personal experiences.

Perhaps I'm being especially stupid this morning, but where?  Every example he gives is specific in nature.  At no point does he lump multiple political groups into one generic 'right wing' statement that I can see?

&gt; Indeed they do, but harassment and assault or not what would traditionally be described as ""a message of hope, of optimism rallying around a coherent alternative that can inspire."" unless said message is ""you agree with me or you're wrong and fuck you because of it""

It's not do what we want or we'll stand around in the capital city.  There's no teeth to that. 

I'm not saying marches don't do anything.  Marches are important because they show popular support for the movement and there's a big difference between a popular movement coercing the government and an angry minority coercing the government.  

But marches **on their own** are little more than tantrums.  Without some sort of political action to back them up, there's no reason to listen to them.  More than a million people may have protested the Iraq war in 2003, but then the Labour party got elected again in 2005.  Why should they listen?

Students tend to live in cheaper areas and tend to have expensive things. It is impossible to be a student without a laptop and a mobile phone. Both valid targets. 

I am sorry? Are you suggesting that the white minority of South Africa is being oppressed? Do you remember when Black South Africans couldn't vote? Or couldn't get an education? Or get access to doctors? Remember how devastating HIV/AIDS is in South Africa due to no access to doctors in black areas and a total lack of education leading to most black people being unaware of the disease resulting in the world's biggest HIV outbreak? 

No? If you think Apartheid is so hot? I suggest you spend a year living under those conditions. Leave your job. Work minimum wage outside. Since it is SA you need to work in the heat. You cannot complain about anything. Stand on buses. No GP care. No medicine. No Food. 

All those things add up. Had South Africa treated black people better you wouldn't be in this mess. Your argument is that we cannot let them vote because we didn't give them the tools necessary to vote. 

It will take decades for South Africa to fix itself. And it is the legacy of apartheid. It had to be fixed. Whether it was today or in 1990 black people would have become equals.

Saudi Arabia that is not - the intelligence service the US Treasury constantly moan about policing terror financing with less enthusiasm than Gandhi on a shooting range, the intelligence service that couldn't stop Al Qaeda moutning a bombing campaign for many years, the intelligence service which told the Americans ""We supply the money, you do the work. We can't do that bit."" (Afghanistan 1980s, but the same holds true and most of the key players from that era are now v senior within House of Saud."") IS also have a v strong support network in Saudi who probs helped them out.

In Iraq - They are also precariously balanced on a  Sunni population who outnumber them hundreds to one. Oil is running low, its harder and harder to find buyers for it, taxation is going up. ISIS have a lot of money for a terrorist group but not enough money to run a country. If the SUnni tribes are savvy they can use ISIS to carve out a nice new country for themselves, and then turn on them once that's done.

On Libya - you have a stronger case. Just remember that IS hasn't ""spread"" to Libya. It's the same guys who've been there for years, different name. So why haven't they attacked already? I don't think given all that is going on they are in a situation much different from IS in Iraq or syria, and thats why they haven't attacked. under serious pressure, putting resources into self-defence and tactical expansion, rather than aggression abroad. In any case, I don't see how bombing them is going to stop them loading a boat of twenty guys into Rome. Libya needs a unity govt, massive (seriously massive, like Marshall Plan massive) financial aid as a carrot, not more violence and bombing.

Even riding it home I thought ""this thing cannot be legal"". And yet it never felt lethal, just hugely competent at going very, very fast, so I traded it in for a thou.

Riding the thou away from the dealer, I got to the first bit of open road, got to a bit over the ton in third, and thought ""how much quicker than the 750 can this thing be then?"" A couple of miles later I thought ""blimey - won't need to do that again in a hurry"".

Fast forward six years and I still have it, and it's got all the goodies - quickshifter, TRE, lower gearing, better brakes and suspension - because it had started to feel a bit sluggish. Don't use it on the road much anymore though, just the track.

Moral of the story is, working your way up gradually is the right way to do it, but it's amazing what you can get used to over time.

I know there is a paraplanning apprenticeship, which you may want to look into. I haven't seen it myself, but it is something on offer for A level leavers. 

&gt; Also im really motivated and would sink all my spare time into this, any qualifications, books or anything i can read/do from home that would help? Thanks, again

Sound odd, but sink that time into your A levels. Getting A's in those and getting into a good university, taking a good course, and walking out with a good grade will be a far better payoff in the long term if you are wanting to get into the IFA game. Even if you don't want to go to university, you want to get better A level grades - you more or less only get one chance to get good A levels. With all these advising qualifications, if you fail you can always retake another time. 

From what I've seen, the top grad schemes going into the IFA industry only require a degree, and they don't expect you to arrive with any relevant qualifications. One person who I knew who secured a good grad scheme didn't even know anything about the CII exams!

However, as I said in my other post - there are still options out there if you are not wanting to go to university. A degree only helps get the foot in the door. Beyond that it really depends on performance. In my opinion, if you haven't got a degree you may struggle to move between firms in the early years - which may mean staying at a company longer than you intended.

Fair cop

&gt;Owens himself says exactly this. Did we just read the same article? The first four and penultimate paragraphs are him building up to and saying exactly the same thing.

What Owens does is deflect from the completely biased whitewash in the middle. He sets the stage in the beginning then includes a decent amounts of ""however"" and ""buts"" to justify what he says in the mid section. 

By opening with 

&gt;But Carswell is a charming and thoughtful bloke more interested in technology-based libertarianism than kneejerk rightwing populism.

[Oh really](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Carswell#Political_positions) (im not copying the whole bunch as its a bit lengthy) but he's not exactly the shining beacon of leftist morality that Owens claims he is.

&gt;Perhaps I'm being especially stupid this morning, but where? Every example he gives is specific in nature. At no point does he lump multiple political groups into one generic 'right wing' statement that I can see?

The entire mid-section of the article is riddled with it. &lt;heres a tiny bit of its not all doom&gt; BUT &lt;heres some more reasons it is&gt;.

&gt; No, Carswell should not have been subjected to his upsetting experience. **But** if he, or anyone else, believes that people are going to stop protesting about the living wage, the housing crisis, workers’ rights, tax justice, public services, climate change, or whatever, then they will be sorely disappointed.

im sure most (no not all) politicians are open to debate and given then diversity of people of course you get conflicting views, but dont try and justify why its ok to go beyond the realms of whats deemed socially acceptable. 

&gt;I'm glad you and Owens agree on this.

I agree with what he says at face value but that's not what this piece is about. It's just shit stirring and justifications

If they disagree with the marks given they'll look at other samples to see if it's endemic across all students.

Yes, I am saying that the white minority is being oppressed, in fact theyre being murdered and thats why theres a petition for their right to return. There's also the fact that the country has gotten massively worse by most objective measures since the end of apartheid, and that most of the things (medicine, say, or buses) that you demand be shared are actually things white europeans brought with them to which the entitlement of others is debateable. We can talk about zimbabwe if you prefer, which has been ruined agriculturally since the white farmers were forced out. Or, we can leave your barbary-slaver ignorant endorsement of white genocide in africa, and your consideration of people with more than you as valid targets, for another day - you've already shown you're a jealous racist thieving scumbag who will avoid questions and ignore pertinent facts, and on that basis I'd rather not converse with you at all.

Eye shadow quality can vary quite a lot within a brand across different palettes and the quality of Naked 1 may not be the same as Naked 3. And versatility wise the iconic 3 which is a dupe of naked 3 tends to be a lot less versatile if you're not cool toned. Its kinda like comparing pink lipstick with a beige one in the same line by the same brand.

Though, I agree that to at least try out the products, MUR iconic is a good place to start. I bought the Iconic 2 and the Iconic Pro (Lorac Pro dupe). Can't compare to the Lorac Pro as I haven't got it yet (in the mail, but I compared the palettes with a friends Naked 2 palette, and I wasn't really impressed. The colour pay off wasn't great even with a primer and I found the colours really hard to blend. It also made me realise the Naked 2 isn't really versatile for me, both the MUR dupe and original are too glittery.

I liked the colours on the MUR Iconic Pro but again colour payoff wasn't but got a bit better with NYX milk underneath but still hard to blend in my opinion. I really like the combinations I felt i could make with the Lorac Pro colours and think its quite versatile but I will have to report back once it arrives!

Definitely need a new RB (Manquillo has been completely sideswiped, what a shot to the confidence, he's just a kid), but more than continuously replacing players in the position, hopefully a defensive coach could sort out a majority of the problems.

No matter the money spent or the quality brought in, the same mistakes will be made if the playing style isn't changed.

null,false,groundtraveller,eu,currently Scotland,null,"Depends on where you travel to. As an international student in Dundee I can usually get the train the same price or less than a flight. This does not take into account budget airlines as there's only Ryanair from Edinburgh to Frankfurt Hahn but they are rather inconvenient as they travel only a few times a week and I can't take any luggage or they are more expensive than using Lufthansa from Aberdeen or Edinburgh. But then you still have to get to the airport but you can use advance tickets to connect with the Eurostar.

So what I do nowadays is book a sleeper berth advance down to London, get into London shortly before 8 am, having departed from Dundee at the great time of 11 pm (plenty of time to pack). Then I head over to St Pancras where I store my large bag. I have then got time until about 2 pm, when I try to be back at St Pancras to collect my rucksack and check in. The train departs shortly after 3, getting into Brussels at 5 past 6 local time. Twenty minutes later the ICE towards Frankfurt departs. It is very easy to connect onto another train at Frankfurt airport as they are usually at the same or opposite platform. On the way back it is now leaving home at 6 am, taking the Eurostar shortly before 11 and getting into London just before noon. You've then got 2 hours until the departure of the next direct train to Dundee where you arrive shortly before 8pm.

Now let us get to the cost of the whole thing. I have to admit that I own a 16-25 railcard and a German railcard. The German one only saves my 10 Euros though and the other the usual 34%. London to anywhere in Germany starts at €54 which I usually get. This is one way so double that and €4.50 each way for reservations. Now to the British bit. You can get the sleeper from twenty something quid, but sharing a cabin for £43.75 is way better. On the return there are advances which guarantee the connection. They cost £20.75 in standard but I like to splurge the £33.65 1st for the included food.

Now compare this to flying. The flight costs me at least 100 quid but it is usually already more expensive as the booking opens so early (compare 1 year for the sleeper advances, but I budget for an anytime seated anyway (just under 50 quid), 3 months ( 13 weeks) international and then 12 weeks (but only released once a week) for the British advance tickets). To the airport it's 25 quid but only if I return within a month. This isn't an issue on the train as all tickets are one way. In Germany budget 40 Euros. I usually end up spending roughly similar amounts though as I just upgrade bits, but I don't have to use some stupid city bus with all my luggage. And I can actually take an extra hand baggage item.

The best I've ever done was this Christmas. Down to Edinburgh to catch the sleeper, then refresh (had shower access back then), then take a cheap taxi. Amuse yourself in London, then take the train to Germany. On the way back leave at 9:30, a few extra spare hours booked in Brussels, have some Belgian chips and burger for lunch. Then on to London to catch the sleeper back.",null,0,null,1432988557,null,0,false,0,crptuq9,null,t3_37twfg,null,t1_crptuq9,null,t1_crpsg5r,null,null,null,1433391588,null,22,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,22,null

For whatever reason, the intersection between non-Coeliac people who go ""gluten-free"" and vegetarians seems large (from my anecdotal experience). Maybe it's just because vegetarians are more likely to be health-conscious and also less likely to trust the food industry (since they are against the food industry's harm to animals) that they are more likely to convince themselves that gluten is harmful to them. 

For people with real gluten-related diseases, I think it tends to be a mixed blessing. On the one hand, bigger market for products they can eat. On the other, lazy chefs know that if someone orders ""gluten-free"", there's a good chance that there will be no consequence to them serving gluten.

Anyway, on the vegan subreddit, people who complain that vegan recipe suggestions aren't gluten-free get shot down, that's my point. There's a subreddit for /r/glutenfreevegan for vegan Coeliacs. Vegans love gluten, anyway, since it is used to make the best homemade substitute meat, seitan :P.

He makes an incredibly valid point. The guy saying ""It's actually the Private eye who did most of the leg work"" is totally wrong yet he will be upvoted simply because people prefer the idea of a more left wing paper doing the work over a right wing one.

If you really don't want to register or provide ID, and don't need the £100 of bitcoin in a hurry, then buy from https://bittylicious.com , buying in small chunks.  

Sellers or sites that sell will often ask for ID for larger amounts in order to protect themselves from the risk of fraud and/or to comply with AML/KYC rules. 

Other options in the UK are https://bitbargain.co.uk and https://localbitcoins.com/ .

I've used all three of the above sites as a buyer quite a lot with no bad experiences.  

Most sellers would regard PayPal and credit card as high risk ways of selling due to the danger of chargebacks for the seller.

The three sites I've mentioned have guides for buying bitcoin, e.g.

If you're starting out with trying to figure out bitcoin, then I wouldn't bother with Armoury.  The easiest way to safely store your bitcoins is to get yourself a Trezor.

http://www.bitcointrezor.com/

Trezor is pretty much an idiot proof way of doing things.  But make sure you store the master seed for the Trezor in a safe place. Preferably have a few copies, in safe places.

Nobody *wants* to purposely act in an immoral way so as you say, these attacks will make them feel very uncomfortable.

For example, a single massive employer like British Telecom would be a fertile breading ground for collectivism because management is vertically integrated. Today though there are hundreds of smaller telecom outfits, and even more semi-related industries that cross-contract with each other. How can a union like the CWU command the same power it had over 1970's British Telecom with a modern telecoms company when some staff work for MITIE, some work for Kelly Communications, some work for TATA (in India, no less), some for CGI/Logica, some for ... etc.

null,false,AnxiousMo-Fo,,Labour | Check out /r/LabourUK!,null,"Posting this article as it refutes several of the common arguments used by people, here and elsewhere, to support the government's attack on trade unions.

**Argument 1:** 'It's not banning strikes! It's just making them more democratic!' (**NB:** *This argument is usually followed by a statement that makes it clear the person using this argument hopes that the policy will, in fact, lead to fewer strikes.*)

&gt;It’s simply disingenuous for the government to insist this is not a case of banning strike action by the back door. On one hand the Conservatives say it’s about democracy, but on the other **they ignore the calls of general secretaries to modernise balloting union members**. Len McCluskey commented, **“Unite has said repeatedly that the way to increase turnouts in strike ballots is not to make it harder for people to exercise fundamental rights, but to modernise voting.”** While Mark Serwotka said last week, **“We have been asking this and previous governments for 10 years to make it easier for people to participate and vote. Electronic voting, voting by phone, voting by internet, supervised voting in the workplace. The government says ‘no, we’re not prepared to allow you to do any of those things.’”**

**Argument 2:** 'Labour shouldn't automatically be funded by the unions! It's not fair on people who don't support Labour!'

Indeed. The Labour Party agrees! Belonging to a union is optional. Donating to the political fund is optional. Anyone can opt-out whenever they want. Union members are not considered to automatically support Labour: You have to actually tell them you're a Labour supporter, even if you're already a member of the Labour Party separately from your union membership. As the article says:

&gt;“This will certainly mean a cut in the political fund and a reduction in funds for the Labour Party. **As it is political funds are already subject to approval in regular ballots by the unions.** This seems like spite coming as it does from a party funded by multimillionaires and hedge funds who will be able to sign cheques free from any restrictions.”

So unions a) allow their members not to pay into the political funds and b) regularly allow their members a say in whether they would like a political fund at all, even if they don't currently pay into it. There could hardly be more opportunity to opt-out.

**Argument 3:** 'Unions shouldn't be involved in politics anyway. They should focus on fighting for their members'. (John Major recently made this argument.)

It's impossible to separate these two things. If you say 'We want all our members to have a living wage', you're making a political argument. Major's argument actually makes it clear that the government's real motivation is to depoliticise (i.e., completely defang) trade unions. The legislation in fact covers *all* political funds, even those of unions not affiliated to Labour:

&gt;The political fund is the pot of money unions have to campaign on all political activities, not simply to fund the Labour Party – indeed **a significant number of unions don’t even donate to the Labour Party**. Trade union political activity include campaigns such as opposing NHS privatisation and the closure of SureStart centres, and the ability to campaign for better working conditions at a political level, such as implementation of the Living Wage.

So, the legislation, while it will undoubtedly hurt Labour's funding, will also make it enormously difficult for any trade union to oppose any government's policies.",null,0,null,1432991593,null,0,1432991975,0,crpuqbq,null,t3_37u8lu,null,t1_crpuqbq,null,t3_37u8lu,null,null,null,1433392002,null,8,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,8,null

Kelly is pretty concerned with what other people think about her. You can see evidence of this when they bring in the girl with Alopecia that landed her in community service in the first place. They only fought because Kelly thought she called her a slut, and Kelly, ever self-conscious, didn't want people thinking that about her, especially not when she was in a very serious relationship at the time.

Alisha, as other people have pointed out, was pretty much concerned with boys not wanting her. She makes it pretty obvious that she thinks her self-worth is in her appearance, and because of it, she can do whatever she wants. By having that power over people, she doesn't have to worry about that, but obviously, be careful what you wish for.

Simon has always been sort of invisible, lonely. I mean, dude watches people and creates videos in secret of them. Kinda weird. The one friend he did have blew him off when they got older and left him alone. He was always invisible, but the storm made it really happen.

Curtis, especially early on, is always upset about ""if I hadn't gotten caught. If things had been just a little different, I wouldn't be in this mess"". So, time travel. But as it turns out, things are the way they are for a reason, and everything's got consequences.

I've seen a lot of people speculate about Nathan's power, and one of the other comments really nailed it when they brought up Nathan's rooftop speech at the end of S1. He loves life. He pretends the things he does are harmless and have no consequences. Basically, he thinks he's invincible. Or, that's what the image he projects is. In truth, he puts up that shield to pretend things don't hurt him, that nothing can faze him. Inside, he's kind of sad and a little lonely because he can't keep friends. He treats the people around him like shit, his mum has seemingly chosen another guy over him (in his head anyway), and his dad's always been kind of a dodgy prick. It's just a supernatural manifestation of the image he projects to protect himself.

I'm still trying to figure out how this really works with the cast later on, though I have a lot of really good ideas about Rudy, who you meet in S3.

However, especially around areas like benefits, or immigration, we're seeing a more rightward swing in the working class. That's one reason why UKIP are becoming more popular within some working class areas. It isn't because people necessarily agree with all their views, they just view immigration as an important issue to the working class. 

Also, I think one strange thing seen in the general election was the apparent number of Lib Dem voters who went to UKIP. Of course, it could have been a flow from Lib Dem to Tory and Labour, and Tory and Labour to UKIP, but it seemed many who voted Lib Dem in 2010 voted UKIP in 2015. Due to the massively different ideologies of the two parties, it would suggest people aren't necessarily voting for a party they totally agree with, rather they're voting for any major party who aren't Labour or Tories.

Not a major issue. When migrants are drowning in the Mediterranean Sea, and places like Australia (oddly enough) and Israel are detaining many in concentration camps, I think the Qatari policy of accepting illegal migrants into the labour force is oddly one of the more progressive policies, even if it is effectively wage slavery, their freedom of movement upon joining is heavily infringed upon and they're treated as disposable.

&gt; it would also be better for the sport as Qatar scored lowest out of the prospective countries for hosting the tournament. 

I'm not sure if that's in terms of climate, or what sort of reasoning they're determining that. If it's the heat, I'm sure that Qatar is rich enough to send some of their disposable migrants to fit air conditioning into the stadium.

&gt; Blatter is at the heart of these bribery scandals, i suggest you watch the Panorama doc or read the numerous articles on Fifa bribery. Basically if you want to have your country host the tournament you have to pay lots of money to certain individuals.

Barriers in the UK are only open when there's someone there to watch over them; outside of core hours, they do just leave them open.

The guy called this sub closed-minded when it comes to right-wing media sources. He used different words but that was what he was saying, and that is why i told him to go fuck himself. And I'd do it again.

I certainly agree that there is an increased scrutiny of right-wing sources and information, partly (only slightly) as a result of bias, but it can't be a coincidence that those sources happen to also be the very worst of British journalism independent of where they lie on the political spectrum. 

The Telegraph, for example, very much right-wing leaning but was a well-respected right-wing source of news (Delingpole aside) until very recently when they decided to burn down the Chinese wall between advertising and content with the HSBC scandal, their decision to go with a Head of Content rather than an editor, and most recently their attempt to manufacture a scandal about a BBC TV show where the author of the article talking about how people on Twitter have dubbed it the ""working class hunger games"" was the first person on twitter to use that term.

It's convenient for those right-wing sources to decry bias as a reason for criticism when it lies or misleads the public, it allows them to rebut criticism from people who likely aren't their target audience anyway, it's placates a lot of those who do, and it's an extremely easy argument to make; an argument that is unsupported by either logic or substance.

Qatar arent accepting illegal workers, fuck knows why you thought that.

If they dont work they are thrown in prison, so they are subsequently worked to death.

- To own a cottage in a small village, bonus points if it has a pretty village sign and a silly name.

- To own one or two shittier properties to rent out to younger peple trying to get where you are.

- A mid production Range Rover sport with a private plate. It'll fool most people.

- Two Labradors/Setters/Springers/Pointers called Percy and Preston.

- To live in a safe Tory seat. Deep deep down, everyone is a Tory once they get far along enough in life.

- To take British Holidays that cost more than foreign holidays. Two weeks in a cottage in a trendy seaside Cornish town for example. Triple points if you own that cottage and the locals fantasise about burning it.

null,false,offshoretaxhaven,null,null,null,"Pretty much. It's often what many people go to university for. 

I got flung into a management position straight out of university, coming out 5+ years ahead of people who may not have got a degree. It isn't something that is guaranteed, and there is also a hell of a lot of luck involved (and at times unfortunately family connections). Although I know a few people who didn't go to university become more successful than some of those that went to top universities.  

Most industries will let you leapfrog those that haven't gone to university, entering at a management level. Relevant here are schemes like the one at [St James Place](http://www.sjpcareers.co.uk/rotational-graduate-scheme). There are also a few A level schemes that allow for a similar sort of thing, but I haven't seen them on the scale as the grad opportunities for wealth management.

I wouldn't enter university on the promise that it will lead to a great job, however if you work hard and get a bit lucky you have a better chance of doing well career wise. Bear in mind there are also thousands of IFA's without a degree.

I also saw you asked about what degree to do. In all honesty, it doesn't really matter for many grad schemes. Have a really good look at any syllabus and see if that is something you can commit three years of your life to. Don't pick something because you were told it was the best for X job. You may be surprised, that recruiters sometimes like a bit of variety in their graduates, just ideally try to relate it to your hopeful career path.

Use something like unistats, search a course and a university, to see the most common jobs afterward. Without trying to imitate thestudentroom (an awful place), try to pick something you will be proud to tell people you studied. Another tip would be to look at job ads for jobs you want in the future - they will often say their 'desired graduates' i.e. those with an economics, maths or law degree. 

As for getting a placement year, I have got a feeling that most university courses will allow for someone to take out a year for industry, even if their degree doesn't advertise itself that it allows this. Be sure to ask if this is an option at any open day etc.

child poverty has already been growing in this country under the coalition, makes sense that it would continue to do so under more severe state cuts.

it's worth mentioning: child poverty actually markedly decreased under the last labour government as well, it was one of the issues they were committed to battling. so it is certainly something affected by policy if anyone was unsure.

With [73.8% of the Qatari population being foreign-born](http://esa.un.org/unmigration/TIMSA2013/Data/subsheets/UN_MigrantStock_2013T3.xls), in comparison to the paltry percentage figures for the Western countries, it's hardly unreasonable for me to have made assumptions that the Qatari [""slave"" labour force](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/25/revealed-qatars-world-cup-slaves) consists of illegal migrants. I simply failed to fathom how so many people would move there legally; albeit, I was aware of the hiring of the poor, but didn't realise that was fully government-backed, and assumed that they would take the workforce and contracting from the readily-available illegal migrant stock rather than going to the trouble of actively hiring abroad. Is that not a rational and more efficient thought process?

&gt; They go to poorer areas of countries like Bangladesh and Nepal offering jobs and accommodation, have people sign contracts and ship them off. Little do the workers know that Qatari policy on migrant workers means that they are owned by their employer, they arrive and have their passports taken off them trapping them in the country so they literally cant leave. If they dont work they are thrown in prison, so they are subsequently worked to death.

So they provide them food, money and accommodation on the condition that they work to help build the society which they live in, as part of a consensual legally binding contract which they sign up to? Still seems better than living in poverty or [drowning in the Mediterranean](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-31437971) and giving [Katie Hopkins the satisfaction of condemning you](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/apr/19/katie-hopkins-migrants-vermin-darkest-history-drownings).

&gt; Qatars world cup bid was laughable, they only have a population of 2 million, their bid includes building stadiums in cities that dont actually exist. I really think you should go read more on the matter and perhaps watch the Panorama doc from a few years ago before commenting on it.

Building ghost towns aren't exactly uncommon - in fact, [the phenomenon is well known in China, also](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19049254). If they have the money to create cities, and they follow through, who cares that those cities haven't yet been built?

As for their small population, coming from where I do in the UK, Cumbrians are well aware of the ignorance and marginalization that occurs to smaller areas (no, Carlisle is not Cardiff, idiots of the world). I think it's a justice, not an injustice, that a country like Qatar has been given publicity on the world stage.

I know you probably think that makes you a principled person who isn't going to take any shit but it actually just makes people with opposing opinions less likely to post. You're not winning an argument by deterring intelligent conversation by telling somebody to fuck off. If you keep that approach up you'll find yourself surrounded only by people with the same opinions as yourself. 

&gt; I certainly agree that there is an increased scrutiny of right-wing sources and information, partly (only slightly) as a result of bias, but it can't be a coincidence that those sources happen to also be the very worst of British journalism independent of where they lie on the political spectrum.

That's total bollocks though, it's not scrutiny. Everybody just upvoted a guy saying Private eye came out with the investigative journalism which is a total lie, it was the Times and the Telegraph which are both right wing newspapers and weren't even considered. 

If any one of those people had stopped to actually check that fact instead of just assuming it was correct because they hold a left-wing bias you could call it scrutiny, but obviously most people didn't. 

The quality of journalism in the Guardian has gone just as down hill as the Telegraph it's just less offensive because of your political leaning. There number of people on this sub that think there's no need to critically evaluate the Guardian because they're less likely to lie is astounding.

Imagine if you will a system where all the healthcare was saved for say... British Indians. The argument is this. British Indians have higher education rates, higher employment rates adjusting for those in long term higher education. A population of 1 million British Indians provides the UK with nearly 25% of it's doctors. It would take 20 MILLION ""natives"" to match that.

So you don't get education saved for you cause it is a ""waste"". You don't get healthcare saved for you cause it is a ""waste"". You don't get the same trains. You don't have the same futures. The best you can do is ""be a miner boss"". You cannot vote. You cannot make any changes. All complaints fall on deaf years. Over decades this will result in your kids not being ""Intelligent"". Worse? It would mean that due to the fact that there are no education opportunities, there is no opportunity to develop a culture where education is important. We see this in a lot of apartheid nations (India is the odd one out. India's apartheid was overthrown by a middle class of highly educated people)

Zimbabwe? Okay imagine if a bunch of Martians showed up and took all the farm land and again instated the system of above. All the wealth was in the hands of martians and you had no opportunities to gain them. Ziimbabwe mis-handled the acquisition of land for the workers. However...

What price do you think those white farmers paid for their wealth. It was not paid by those white farmers. The point of apartheid is to keep other races down on purpose. 

You tell me? A bunch of white guys came and outright stole land from a bunch of Zimbabweans. LIke ""murder and guns"" were involved"". Today their descendents have all the wealth and this wealth is denied to black people. What level of damages do you think should be paid out for such torture? 

Do you think equality comes at the drop of a hat? That the day apartheid fell everything was okay? Not quite so... I would have maintained white farmers but they would have to pay a reconstruction tax rate. A higher rate.

Instead they voted for thatcher lite, New labour to come in with a mandate to upgrade the deficit in public services that been allowed to run up by the Tories.
 But by letting their private sector mates in Barclays and other private institutions to front the cash for awful PFI deals that reward the lender with over generous and moronic deals that pay back the original cost over and over again to these private institutions. Even though it would be cheaper for the government to just borrow the money itself. 

People will once again get sick of the deliberate under investment in public services, they will once again get sick of the corruption and sleaze that follow the Tories like a shadow. It will just take time.

It's a franchise system, and these franchises are often either regional (e.g. Southeastern run all the services around Kent) or route-specific (e.g. the West Coast Main Line). Companies can bid to run a franchise, and then the government will award the winner the right to run trains on the routes included. Some companies are localised whilst others, particularly those owned by national operators (e.g. FirstGroup) will try for multiple franchises. [Wikipedia has a list here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_companies_operating_trains_in_the_United_Kingdom#Franchised_passenger_operator_structure_in_Great_Britain). So any company that can successfully make its case to the government gets to run trains.


The government is no longer allowed to run railways directly - although it can take over if a company pulls out of a franchise until a new agreement is reached, as happened with the East Coast Main Line recently.

Supply and demand,  there is no demand for UK labour with an over supply of European labour in the numbers we have witnessed since the accession 8 countries gained free movement.  Therefore there is no  demand for **pay rises** by Local UK labour and working class.

I remember the labour market before the A8 countries joined, it was very common for business that couldn't recruit, to hand out a cash bonus if you managed to recruit a worker you knew and he passed his 3 months probation. 
Anything between £50-£300 in various business I have worked for.  Pay rises were also commonplace.

Since the A8 countries added their labour pool to the UK economy, pay rises for working class jobs have all but dried up, no more retention bonus.

This is where the working class have been hit and this is why they have deserted Labour.  Labour need to recognize this and try to win back this vote or they will lose it to the Kippers forever.

null,false,Eluros,null,null,null,"Hey.

I'm 23 M, still living at home, earning slightly more than you. I recently started trying to get my finances in order. I had some savings sat in an ISA that was earning hardly any interest and a current account I set up when I was 16. 

The first thing I did was open a halifax reward current account, you get £5 per month (granted not a lot but its free money) every month you pay in £750 and have 2 direct debits (Do you have a mobile phone? I believe paypal works too but you would have to make sure it pulls money out every month). http://www.halifax.co.uk/bankaccounts/current-accounts/reward-current-account/

The next thing I did was open a TSB current account that pays 5% interest (before tax) on savings upto £2000. This requires you to pay in £500 a month but doesn't require any direct debits. You can put the money in and take it straight back out however and you still qualify. So my wage gets paid into halifax, I get the £5, i pay £500 into TSB (which has £2000 in it) then transfer it straight back to my halifax account. http://www.tsb.co.uk/plus/?WT.mc_id=1613487|110700122|280835226|0

Since my TSB account is now ""full"" I am looking into opening a nationwide current account. 5% on upto £2500 but need to pay in £1000 a month. 

Takes a bit of work and managing multiple accounts can take a bit of getting used to but its much better than having money sat in an ISA thats earning next to no interest. I believe cash ISA interest is paid annually? With the current accounts its paid monthly so you can see it working which is quite satisfying.

Basically my plan is to keep saving what I can but save it smartly. Keep following the best interest rates.

The government are also starting a scheme later this year, its a help to buy ISA. Works like a normal ISA, you can pay in £200 a month and the government will you give a 25% bonus on this (so £50 on £200). Upto a maximum of £3000 bonus (£12000 saved). This can only be used to buy a house but its a massive percent of money. This is something I am definitely going to go for. https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/413899/Help_to_Buy_ISA_Guidance.pdf

tl;dr - Make the most of interest rates on savings. Look into help to buy ISA for your £200 a month.

Hope this all makes sense.

Sure you can go without the first 10 years and not feel anything but eventually it catches up.

Feeding my kids meat occasionally and supplement if needed will avoid those problems I have because if I had eaten meat I wouldn't have B12 deficiency. That's literally the only difference between what I eat and what the rest of my family eats. The meat.

Honestly, there's no need to defend the lifestyle. I'm a vegetarian, I get it. I won't go back to meat, but it's important to be honest about it and realise that things like B12 will cause problems if you don't supplement or occasionally eat some meat.

We missed out on him, but didn't sign anybody else for that position/role instead, even though he signed for Dortmund on July 8th. We also didn't sign anybody else for that level of money either that window. 

Make the club sound like its being more proactive: The club got hammered in its last game, and within the next week, we've bid 10m for Clyne, 18m euro for Kovavic, and willing to bid over 20m for Benteke as soon as the FA final is over?.

We live in a multinational world where the days on shop floor Unionisation and vast state run apparatus are long gone. 

Does the Labour Party have a future? I really think, and hope so. That's important, because I voted conservative and could broadly be classed (I think) as one of these media-fabled ""aspirational"" voters. The reason I didn't vote labour, despite voting for them in the two prior elections was that Milibands agenda lacked any sort of middleground. It was great if you were poor, sick or infirm and bad if you're stinking rich. But most of us actually sit in the vast wasteland in between.

Labours big weapon was the cost of living crisis, and they failed to play to its strengths. There is a growing intergenerational living standards crisis that reflects itself in many different aspects of our modern lives.

The situation looked cut and dried; the UK and Spain are both EU members and have a good recent history of extradition between the two, and the House of Lords had approved his extradition to Spain. It looked as if the old dictator would have to face the music in the Spanish courts.

Then Jack Straw ruled that Pinochet should go free and he returned to Chile.

Same with Roman Polanski. Arrested in Switzerland in 2009 at the request of US authorities. He was held for 10 months before the Swiss refused to extradite him and let him go free.

Obviously these are different and unrelated cases, but extradition is not a done deal even after suspects have been arrested, and I'm wary of jumping the gun in this case.

From a personal perspective I was hoping that Michael van Praag would beat Blatter in the election for FIFA President as I believed him to be the strongest candidate.

They could buy trains if they wanted but its easier to lease them because the contracts are quite short term.

That's more or less all there is to it.

In the beginning, it was partly because outside of the 1996 movie, we had never seen the Doctor have a romantic story line, so, it was something completely new to try out. Beyond that, I don't really ever remember a time when it was *just* the Doctor and a male companion. There's always a girl around. Even in the 60's. 

It could be simply that when they cast new companions, women outperform men. 

It could be that two men leading the show makes for a weird dynamic that didn't test well.

null,false,groundtraveller,eu,currently Scotland,null,"Right, so I feel I should expand on this a bit. To find your relevant fare I recommend [BRFares](http://www.brfares.com). The destination options you should look for are LONDON INTL(CIV) and LNDON ESTAR CIV. Now the difference between the two is the following:

If you use Eurostar’s website or call them they will sell you LNDON ESTAR CIV.  
You should now the following about these. They are sometimes cheaper than the LONDON INTL(CIV) fares but can only be bought through Eurostar. If you have a railcard avoid the Eurostar website. They can only sell you a ticket in combination with a Eurostar ticket and are unable to apply any railcard discounts. The website will also only sell you tickets for the next possible connecting train. This will be an issue when you want to travel to Germany. Eurostar do have tickets to a limited number of destinations in Germany but they won’t combine it with UK rail travel online. So you have to call them anyway. Their phone number for the British connections is **01233617913**, staffed Monday to Friday 9 am to 5 pm only. You might have to keep calling as this seems to be just one guy. They are very helpful and will apply any railcard discounts. These tickets do not require proof of onward travel as they are only supposed to be sold with Eurostar tickets. When they ask you for your reference number you should state that. If you’ve bought your tickets from the German railways you won’t have such a reference but they will be happy to sell you a ticket anyway if you can tell them which train you’ll be travelling on. You have to collect these tickets at your local station, they won’t send them but they also don’t charge any booking fees. Eurostar can’t specify any seat requests (e.g. they can’t request window seats). Also you’ll have to buy sleeper berth supplements and PlusBus tickets elsewhere.  
You can find these fares through BRFares (see above) by entering **LNDON ESTAR CIV**. The three letter code for this is **LOE** which should also bring up the same thing.

Anyone else will only be able to sell you tickets to LONDON INTL(CIV). This would be your local ticket office for example. They will require proof of international rail travel (doesn’t need to be Eurostar, could also be a SailRail from East Anglia to the Netherlands). Some operators will be happy with a booking confirmation but this varies. You will also need this on the train to prove your eligibility.  
Sometimes these fares are more expensive than the Eurostar exclusive fares. Also the availability of advance tickets might be worse. Also for some destinations no tickets originating from London are available so you’ll have to buy a return to London. This will be valid for two months however so is unlikely to be an issue. Advantage of this is that you’ll be able to request certain seats and the ticket office should be able to add any extras you wish, like sleeper berths. Also the opening hours of your ticket office are likely to be better than those of Eurostar. You shouldn’t bank on your ticket office to have issued on of these before so here’s what might be useful for them: The tickets will be printed **LONDON INTL(CIV)**. The three letter code for this is **LNE** and the four digit code **5470**. An anytime single in standard class will be called EURO STD SINGLE. All flexible tickets (read excluding advances) will be valid for two months. They should however not be issued for travel more than one day before or after international travel. Again use BRFares to check these fares, using the **LNE** code. Another tip is to switch BRFares to expert mode. This will show whether LNDON ESTAR and LONDON INTERNATIONAL are in the same flow. If this is the case the fares are the same.  
London International tickets can also be bought online from Raileasy (but with a booking fee, and no sleepers) and technically any telesales should be able to do it.

Advantage of of these tickets is the guaranteed connection even on advance tickets. Be more careful however travelling southbound with international tickets not issued by Eurostar. Other continental rail operators might see this differently, they might prefer you to use their own international tickets to get to London. This however is likely to be more expensive. So leave some spare time in London. Northbound however should not be a problem, just make sure you obey the minimum connecting times. Your ticket should include travel to London St Pancras by tube. Check your ticket for this symbol in the route description: &amp;#8224;. This is important as it is not included with all journeys. This applies to stations on the East Coast Mainline for example as these usually do not require a tube transfer as King’s Cross is just across the road from St Pancras. This might occur when you travel from the East of Scotland on the sleeper to Euston station while you are likely to travel to King’s Cross by daytime train. Euston however is definitely possible on foot, it is also just one station on foot and a taxi should cost something like £6. These international tickets are also likely to be cheaper than normal tickets. For Dundee this applies to the cheapest tier of advance tickets, too, for example. Check when your tickets will be released to get the cheapest fares if advance tickets are available on your route. Most companies seem to release theirs twelve weeks in advance doing so once a week during the course of Friday morning. These international tickets are likely to be the cheapest with the exception of sleeper berth inclusive fares or where there are no advances available on your operator. Remember that this however poses a certain risk with missed connections.

Should you encounter any delays, have your tickets endorsed fi they are advances or if it means you would be outside the validity of your tickets. Do this on the continent as well as at your London Terminal before you get on board. This does work, I’ve managed to get on a train from London to Dundee 48 hours later than scheduled when delayed by strikes. One word of advice though: Make sure they endorse your ticket in English, otherwise you’ll be chasing after more people to get another endorsement. Your local station staff might not be able to read it.

Now to give you some advice on those tickets from London to Germany. These start at €59 each way (€109 in Standard Premier on Eurostar and first class onward) from London to anywhere in Germany via Brussles. Germany for these purposes includes Salzburg and Basel Bad Bf (German railway station in Basel, Switzerland). Railcards are available to the general public in both classes, the standard class one only gives a discount on standard fares while the first class one discounts both fares. The discount on those London special fares is €5 only with the 25% Railcard. There are constant offers for limited time railcards so it might be worth it for a visit. WARNING: These come with a subscription so make sure to cancel yours six weeks before expiry at latest.  
The reservation on the Eurostar is free. In Germany reservations in first class are free when made with a ticket booking. In standard class you will be charged €4.50 per Person. This includes all connecting reservations unless there are extra surcharges (some rare limited stop high-speed trains or sleeper trains). There is also a family one which costs €9. This is for up to five people of which at least one has to be a child (14 or under). The child’s parents or grandparents (one is enough) need to be travelling, too.  
These tickets can be booked online on the [English language version of the German railways website](http://www.bahn.de/p_en/view/index.shtml). It is unlikely your British documents will be accepted as proof of ID so you’ll have to order printed tickets in the post. This costs €3.90. If you are already in Germany it can also be booked at a ticket office. Or you can book it on the phone. The German telephone booking number is +491806996633, available 24/7. They should be able to speak English. Be warned that this is a special number so charges might be rather high. I call them on Skype which gives something reasonable of less than a pound for a 15 min booking. They can send out your tickets for €3.90 (You could theoretically have it as ticket on departure, this might only be useful for your return, as this can only be done in Germany). [Or try any of these agencies here](http://www.bahn.com/i/view/GBR/en/home/contact/contact-in-the-uk.shtml). They might charge you a booking fee though so beware. For example I called Deutsche Bahn’s UK office once and they have a rather steep booking fee under a certain ticket value (although this limit is not particularly high). They charged me a fare exchange rate however and you are likely to get your tickets faster than ordering them from Germany.

Something for planning: These tickets fix you to your booked trains. Also travel from Brussels to Germany has to be on one of Deutsche Bahn’s ICE trains of which there are four a day. This gives you three possible ICEs when travelling to Germany and four when returning (unless you stay overnight in Brussels). One problem with the booking engine is that without any extra tweaking it might try to route you via Paris or onto a Thalys trains. One option is to try the [Saver fare finder](http://ps.bahn.de/preissuche/preissuche/psc_start.post?lang=en). The other way is to use vias. Thalys does not call at Brussels Nord so this is an obvious thing to do. Also only the ICE goes to Frankfurt so putting that as a via and direct trains between that and Brussels might help. You can enter vias with a stopover of up to 48 hours. When travelling to Southern Germany I can personally recommend to specify via Koblenz for a scenic but slower route through the Rhine valley.  
Stopovers shouldn’t be expensive and baggage storage is likely to be lockers (roughly €5 for 24 hours, unlike London where it’s £10 for 24 hours).

Feel free to ask me any further questions.

They should recognise that boys like to rush around more than girls do: it’s better to give them lots of organised sports and energy-eating games than to dose them with Ritalin or tell them off for fidgeting. They need to provide more male role models: employing more male teachers in primary schools will both supply boys with a male to whom they can relate and demonstrate that men can be teachers as well as firefighters.

One important aspect I think was missed though was the kind of topics men and women go into. While men are falling behind in Primary and Secondary education, they thrive in STEM related topics.

They're called ""unmanned"" stations, well they are if they don't have a ticket machine, at those you buy a ticket on the train. These stations are usually only in local areas and have low passenger numbers, so they just have an inspector on the train who can sell you a ticket.

&gt;When an inspector on the train checks tickets they just walk through and ask the ones that recently climbed on to volunteer tickets &amp; if you don't they just walk past

Yeah, they try and remember who/where people are, you'll see them stand on the platforms counting who gets on, if only a few they'll go straight for them. I've been ignored plenty of times when I had a ticket.

&gt;If you do volunteer the ticket they stamp it and hand it back (Not convinced they even read it). What is the aim of this?

To invalidate it, you can get tickets that last 30 days, so you could technically use that ticket every day for 30 days. Them marking it invalidates it. When you're looking at thousands of tickets a day, you're going to get good at finding important information quick

&gt;    The barriers at the electronic ticket readers seem to be completely open during specific times (Late night)?

The tickets, or the barriers are usually pretty shit, I've seen people buy a ticket, put it in the barrier and it just spits it back out because it can't read it, so the staff member has to open the barrier manually to allow them through, if there was no one there, you'd be fucked.

I hope that with this mentality you're also one of the people who will actually help with the process. Just a small effort of clearing away a couple of extra trays properly can speed up the entire queue. And with just a few people doing that everyone feels better.

&gt; Not to mention your stuff going for extra screening so you get caught in a new queue and all they do is swab your Kindle for half a second.

You really have to queue for this? It's almost instant for me in every UK airport I've been too (and I don't actually think I've had it happen on the way back). Also, if you take the kindle out your bag (put it in the tray) you pretty much skip this all the time. There are random security checks, but you avoid a lot of the targeted once if you pull stuff out your bags.

As a word of advice. Never travel with a laptop charger, 4 xbox controllers, a wireless controller adapter, my phone, my dad's new phone, phone chargers and two kindles all in one bag...

The only way a move to Madrid will ruin his career is if he gets badly injured, otherwise he'll turn into one of the best player's in the world within 2 seasons.

&gt;What would be wrong though is if you criticised the Mail for a biased article when that article is an opinion piece and not news.

I dunno.  It depends on what people mean by 'bias', which I think is a bit of a slippery word.  

If a journalist at the Mail for instance approaches e.g. a gay-pride parade with such strong right-wing opinions that they conclude that e.g. 'this sinful demonstration proves that gay-marriage is bad', then I think that it would be OK to criticize the bias of the writer -- because it has interfered with their ability to rationally report on the story.

Similarly, I think that it's OK for people to express concerns when CiF published left-wing diatribes which are too ideological.  Jessica Valenti springs to mind as a good example here.  

Note - none of this means that I think any jounalist should be fired or that the newspaper should be fined or anything.  I'm only referring to when its appropriate to criticize.

Because people who didn't want to donate for Labour haven't made an effort to opt out, you mean?

&gt; So unions a) allow their members not to pay into the political funds

Some unions make this very difficult. Unite for example doesn't appear to mention it on [their recruitment form](http://www.unitetheunion.org/pdf/247-online-hayes_membership_form.pdf), and to opt out you have to request/fill out/send a different form once you are a member - [example](http://www.ourunion.org.uk/PoliticalFundExemption.pdf)

&gt; b) regularly allow their members a say in whether they would like a political fund at all, even if they don't currently pay into it. 

But some unions make it all or nothing. Want non partisan campaigning? Tough, the political fund is there for the Labour Party. Want to move unions to one that doesn't support Labour? Tough, as your employer only recognises us

&gt; a significant number of unions don’t even donate to the Labour Party.

But at least one megaunion does - Unite? ""Numbers of unions"" is simply playing with statistics - it's how much money and how many members that covers, that really matters

&gt;  Trade union political activity include campaigns such as opposing NHS privatisation 

They should probably ask for their money back, given the NHS privatisations Labour pushed through

A huge issue with the argument is that no one has made a case for why it shouldn't be opt in. There's just cries of how the Labour Party will lose money, or how it is politically motivated (interesting how Labour doesn't scream that when it's to do with things that benefit them or stuff they did for themselves), or just general fluff. But why shouldn't the Labour Party's funding come from schemes that are more in line with that of other parties? Why shouldn't the unions seek individual approval for a member's contributions to be used for party donations?

In an ideal world there wouldn't be a union affiliated Labour Party (blah blah history yes I know - we're talking about 2015, not 1915) but this is a step forward",null,0,null,1433006987,null,0,1433007334,0,crq1946,null,t3_37u8lu,null,t1_crq1946,null,t1_crpuqbq,null,null,null,1433395146,null,0,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,0,null

Right! But that would be a journalist reporting on a story and reporting on it based on his opinions as opposed to the facts.   
Opinion articles isn't a journalist reporting on the facts of a story, it's a journalist writing about his opinions of the facts of a story, and they're fundamentally different things. One is journalism, the other is commentary.

What doesn't make sense is that people are criticising this as if it's a news article when it isn't a news article.

It's like watching the FA cup final and criticising it for being a shit game of rugby football, when it's association football.

**[As percentage of available minutes](http://i.imgur.com/IItrNZf.png)**

Three players crack the 90% bar : Terry, Ivanovic and Hazard, the three ever-present figures in the league-winning squad. 

Last season the top 3 was Ivanovic (86.6%), Cahill (81.1%) and Cech (79.4%)


---


[**Relative evolution compared to last season**](http://i.imgur.com/6npTc2b.png) 

Early Cup and Champions League exits meant that Chelsea played 54 games compared to last season's 57. The fewest in over a decade outside of the 2010-11 season (53 games)

That means to compare both seasons, I used percentage point. For example, Matic (the most used CM this season) played  over 84% of available minutes this season, when last year Ramires (the most used last season) played 73% of available minutes. Hence the ""+11""

null,false,ghodrick,UnionFlag,London - GSXR 600,null,"I've had a very similar problem with an SV650, and I ultimately got my money back from the trader:

1. Was the bike advertised as running to you? Check the paperwork, used bikes are often sold as repairables (and noone will tell you it says exactly that on the paper you signed when taking delivery of the bike). Any indication to the contrary - i.e. that you could expect it to be free of fault should be documented by you. Like...phone calls where the trader told you it was running great etc. You want to write down when these happened, any witnesses etc. This will back up your claims to get your money back. 

2. Document the timeline of events in painstaking detail. When did you pick it up, how long did repairs take etc. Any undue delay by the trader is going to underpin the argument you make when asking for a refund. 

3. From here onwards, everything has to happen in writing. You want receipts for the repairs, statements from the garage as to what was wrong about the bike etc. 


You want to read up on consumer protection - the law is actually in your favour in this case. Check out the Sale of Goods Act for example. There is a lot of good content on Google if you put in something along the lines of ""Bought faulty motorbike from trader + Refund"" or something along those lines. 


I did all of this, and wrote something along the lines of this:



&gt;""This is to inform you that I would like to return the Suzuki SV650 I bought from you on the 20th of September 2014 for the agreed full refund of GBP1200 plus GBP282.24 in repair costs by a third party you promised to reimburse me for. 

&gt;The bike was sold as fully functioning and without major fault, but does not work as described, as it has broken down three times within the first hundred miles of purchasing it:

&gt;- On the 20th of September, directly after the purchase
&gt;- On the 27th of September, one day after you had repaired it for a first time
&gt;- On the 15th of October, four days after it was repaired by a third party garage

&gt;After the first incident, you offered to repair the bike free of charge. The repair was of unsatisfactory quality as you fitted it with an unsuitable model rectifier that someone had drilled holes into, which you fixed to the bike with cable-binders directly under the seat instead of the appropriate place nearer the back of the bike as one could reasonably expect. After picking it up from your dealership on the 26th of September, the bike immediately broke down again on the 27th.

&gt;On the 27th, you agreed verbally on the phone to reimburse me for the cost of fixing the bike and replacing the rectifier by a third party garage. As per my previous email, the costs for fitting a suitable rectifier and all associated labour costs amount to GBP 282.24, which I have paid on your behalf under protest.
I communicated my bank account details to you via email on October the 13th. 

&gt;After collecting the bike on the 9th from said garage, it broke down again on the 15th of October. You verbally agreed to refund the full purchasing price and promised to call me back the following day to arrange transport of the bike during our phone conversation on Friday the 17th. 

&gt;In conclusion, the bike has lasted an unreasonable length of time, is not fit for purpose and I am unable to accept or continue using it at this point.

&gt;As off the 20th of October, I have not received the full refund or the GBP 282.24 for the repair, nor heard from you to arrange a pick up date to return the bike. Could I ask for you to do the following please:

&gt;- Send the full amount of GBP 1482.24 to account number XXX within 4 working days of receipt of this email

&gt;- Communicate to me when you will be picking up the bike from my home XXX. I am happy to assist with finding a suitable time for both of us.

&gt;Thanks and kind regards,

Blatter is case and point. In what world can someone who has such a desirable job not face any contest for it? His world. 

Only in his world does the stench of corruption not draw out another candidate or his reluctance to introduce new technology into the sport. To me this is evidence that for anyone to make it to those top levels, they must have dirtied themselves and developed strong vested interests not to rock the boat or allow anyone else to do so. We're not talking about corruption in FIFA, but that FIFA is corrupt.

If that is the case, the question that demands to be asked is ""How the hell do you clean up an organisation that has woven corruption into its very fabric?""

null,false,duckwantbread,eng-essex,Essex,null,"&gt; I'm of the opinion that women should have equal opportunities, but progress should slow down until we can find a way to make women more free without suppressing men.

If we define 'suppressing' as reducing opportunities for men I don't see how that will ever be possible, if you have 2 groups of people and one strongly benefits in comparison to the other you can't just magic up a bunch of opportunities to give to the less advantaged group to make them equal, because if that were possible we'd already be giving those opportunities to people. The only way to attain equality is to take some of the resources from the better-off group and use those resources to improve the quality of worse-off resources. Obviously there are exceptions (like discouraging sexist stereotypes) but some things aren't feasible without reallocating resources, e.g. your teaching example (although I'm not really sure what you mean by teaching becoming more feminine), you can't just double the teaching budget so boys get 'masculine' teaching and girls get 'feminine' teaching, you'd need to compromise since you can only afford for one set of teachers.

Origi can't be depended on. He's never proven himself. Go on and say the WC and point out his goal, then go back to see that it was Mirallas who beat the defender and gave him the easy opportunity. Now take his last season in Ligue 1 and take a second to think realistically about how well he'll do his first season in the PL. 

Lambert... Lambert played better than Balo for most of the season, and I thought he should've been given more time (as should've Balo). That said, he's older and way too slow, and can't offer much more than what we've seen of him. We could possibly have played to his strengths better (as we could've Balo's) but that's neither here nor there. Balo on the other hand, played like complete shit as to what anyone who's seen him play before knows what he *can* do. He's 24, rich as fuck, and needs to just settle down. We can get much more out of him. He might've had a pathetic season, but giving up after 1 season is more pathetic than how he played. 

Ings I would like to see here. Having someone who can put in a consistently decent shift (haven't really seen him play but just going by what my intuition would expect based off a very good year) would be good for us all.

They put me in contact with the last guy to get the job, but he never told me and it ended up going unspoken. Turns out that the places were handed out and taken months before the Skype interview.

I was absolutely crushed.

Much more of a cultural thing than skills though, it takes about 2 seconds to find work as a male primary school teacher, but as a whole men don't consider it.

&gt;Men need to understand that traditional manual jobs are not coming back, and that they can be nurses or hairdressers without losing their masculinity

Cultural change is needed, but it's coming. So much has been done already to change attitudes towards gender roles, so I think it's a bit disingenuous to use a tone that suggests that it's something we need to start doing. These things can't happen overnight!

At the same time, a lot of the attitudes held by men (as opposed to women) are due to influences that might be completely out of our control. For example, it's been my experience (and it's been pointed out by lots of feminist philosophy) that the male view of morality is characterised by avoiding conflict - of *not hurting* - while the female view is more concerned with active helping. On the ground level, men simply don't have the same motivation to participate in industries of care.

As for hair well... go figure.

I know the Economist is going to focus on economic and political causes, but just pointing it out and saying ""things really need to change"" isn't very useful if (1) things are already changing and (2) they might not be able to change as much as we need.

A lot of the topics are topics covered in GCSE Maths, but I will name a few more complex topics that you might want to take a look at.

Differentiation - Be comfortable with using dy/dx to find tangents and normals to a curve at a given point, using it to find stationary points, and identifying the nature of the stationary point.

Matrices - Multiplying a 2x2 with a 2x2, or a 2x2 with a 2x1 in respect to transformations.

Geometry - Geometry problems at Further Maths tend to be more challenging, so make sure you are super familiar with all circle theorems, know about the sin rule and both forms of the cosine rule and half ab sinC. 

Trigonometric proofs - being able to manipulate formulas involving sin cos tan theta using the two formulas. 

The spec is great for giving you an oversight for what you need, along with a few example questions demonstrating the skill required. http://filestore.aqa.org.uk/subjects/AQA-8360-W-SP.PDF

Any topics you don't understand, it's bound to be on the internet somewhere!

He also had to give Gerrard game time he probably didn't earn on this seasons performances. He had to integrate a ton of new players into the side and that's not easy at all. Very few players hit the ground running. The only reason we don't notice at the other four clubs is because we don't care. Di Maria was a disaster for Utd. Ozil has been poor for long stretches for Arsenal. Chelsea and City have some massive failed signing nearly every year or a bunch of lesser failures. All of which haven't gotten Mourinho, Wenger, or others fired. 

Most of the shit Rodgers takes comes purely from the fact that he is young. In ten years time I do not doubt that he will have enough trophies to walk into any room with his head above the rest.

Any advice for an older person with no qualifications?
Reluctant to spend 4 years getting a qualification as i would learn so much more in a hands on environment.
Because of the lack of qualifications i have to start at the bottom but believe I have good skills.
Remote support i do with family friends using teamviewer.
I can flash Android devices and install roms etc 
Windows stuff i know , very few problems i cant fix with the software esp if allowed to google.
Hardware i can do the basics , change memory , disk drive , keyboard etc.
I reckon i know enough for 1/2 level support but cant get a start at all or even close due to qualifications.
I worked for 10 years as a lecturer and TBH i feel a course would be a waste of time for me plus with kids etc its not as easy to lose the income when not working.

&gt;Chris Deerin is to be congratulated on penning a whining diatribe which so comprehensively evinces the sense of bitter resentment, arrogant entitlement and pathetic faux victim-hood which pervades the British nationalist cause. I think psychologists call the phenomenon transference. Deerin has taken all the unpleasantness that characterises hard-line unionism and used it to mould the caricature of the SNP that he carries in his delusional head.
&gt;

&gt;It is a quite remarkable work of special-pleading and tunnel vision which sees in every bit of mundane politicking by the SNP some unspeakable evil whilst turning a determinedly blind eye to the odious antics of those who have devoted themselves to the preservation of the old order and the old ways regardless of the cost to the people of Scotland — or, for that matter, the rest of the UK.
&gt;

&gt;The very title of the piece is a glaring example of this transference. Evidently, Deerin has elided from his mind the fact that the comment about “bayoneting the wounded” is most notoriously attributed to his fellow British nationalist fanatic, the obnoxious Ian Davidson.
&gt;

&gt;Deerin bleats piteously about the poor “business leaders” supposedly intimidated into silence by the SNP during the referendum campaign, but has nothing at all to say about the business owners who openly sought to bully their employees into voting No with barely veiled threats to their livelihoods.
&gt;

&gt;He elevates the hapless Jim Murphy to the status of underdog hero in dumb denial of the fact that Murphy spent much of the referendum campaign hectoring and haranguing people on the streets in an effort to provoke that was as clumsily transparent as it was all but entirely unsuccessful. And he forgets that Murphy only got the “Scottish Labour” leadership through by deploying the bullying, arm-twisting, back-stabbing tactics that he has been honing since his days in stident politics.
&gt;

&gt;Alistair Carmichael too gets the hero treatment, which seems to be reserved for anybody who is opposed to Scotland regaining is rightful constitutional status, even if they are a confessed liar known to have attempted a disgraceful smear against Scotland’s First Minister. But I suppose those who make common cause with the likes of the Orange Order and Britain First would be perfectly comfortable in the company of the dishonest and the disreputable.
&gt;

&gt;According to Deerin there is no such thing as fair criticism of journalists. They are to be allowed to lie and distort and mislead and smear with impunity. Challenge their rancid, derogatory perspective on Scotland, its people, its institutions and its politics and you are immediately branded as being part of a heinous plot to deny them their freedom of expression. Journalistic freedom is conditional on minimum professional standards and some semblance of integrity. Who was it that said these things were unimportant compared to defending the ruling elites of the British state against democratic dissent? Not some “cybernat”, but that other bitter, bilious bastion of fundamentalist British nationalism, Alan Cochrane.
&gt;

&gt;I, and many others, can testify to the fact that on the websites of British newspapers and blogs etc. supporting the grindingly negative No campaign, comments challenging the brazen lies of Darling, Brown et al were routinely censored. Where was Chris Deerin’s concern for free speech then?
&gt;

&gt;There are many reasons for the success currently being enjoyed by the SNP, just as there are numerous explanations for the collapse of support for British Labour in Scotland. Chris Deerin would do well to remember that the SNP’s success is in the gift of Scotland’s voters. And that the near wipe-out is the electorate’s verdict on British Labour in Scotland. Having the respect for the people of Scotland that Deerin so obviously lacks, I contend that they simply would not vote in such numbers for the SNP if the party was even remotely akin to the comic-book arch-villain so colourfully conjured by his fevered imagination.
&gt;

&gt;Deerin might also like to reflect on the fact that part of the explanation for “Scottish Labour’s” abject failure to address the democratic challenge is their failure to accept the reality of the SNP as a left-of-centre, social democratic, progressive progressive party. A failure which is so strikingly illustrated by Deerin himself.

Also, Derek Bateman has added an additional comment to his original article - [Dim and Dimmer](http://derekbateman.co.uk/2015/05/25/dim-and-dimmer/).

&gt;At the weekend on Twitter I described Chris Deerin of the Daily Mail as a bigot. That was inaccurate and inappropriate. It was unworthy of him and of myself. It was said in haste and I regret it. I offer him my sincere apologies.
&gt;
What I meant to say, but couldn’t fit in, was that he is intolerant, unreasonable, incorrigible, one-eyed, zealous, doctrinaire, cunning, dogmatic, artful, partisan, ingenious, and Scotophobic.

All of which may be true, but I can't help noticing the similarities with other apologists, who will always do their utmost to avoid conceding there any problems in their ideology.  And if there are problems, it's always the fault of a small minority who don't represent the mainstream and only a bigot, or so it is claimed, would think otherwise.

It's a classic tactic.  It allows the apologist to avoid having to confront any problems with their own ideology, whilst accusing others of bigotry and whilst portraying themselves as noble in their ability to condemn the wrongdoing.

Uncertainty. I suppose that wasn't the entire question - high school is mandatory - what I was uncertain about was how I would be able to cope. I have always found it hard dealing with change. You might feel the same. But don't feel like you're in this alone - in a recent survey, 76% of students aged 10-12 said they were feeling unsure about the future. A figure which is admittedly more worrying that reassuring, wouldn't you think?

But when you're in these situations, it's best to look at the glass as half full, not half empty. Sure, there was more pressure, and more responsibility, but with that came more independence and freedom. You became free from your mother's manacles and began to have your own voice.

Uncertainty is still the question for many of you - I know, I've been there. But If there's one thing to take away from this post, it's this:

""Fake it until you make it.""

It's simple. Want to get better grades? Fake the interest and put the effort in. Want to have more meaningful friendships? FORCE yourself into social situations and fake confidence, and you will become it. Overall, high school presented itself as a good time to become the person you want to be.

Personally, meeting new people was the thing I was most uncertain about. You become accustomed to them: not just your friends but your enemies, your teachers, even the dinner ladies. But, having changed dramatically myself, I can say with (genuine) confidence that I prefer the person I became. Sure, faking it doesn't seem natural. But it's not you lying. It's you learning. And I realised that I was scared of that most; that was I was uncertain of most was learning new things.

And as I write this toward the end of my GCSE exams, I can safely say that high school as been one of the most interesting, fun and unique experiences of my life.

And I can't wait for Sixth Form.""

When I saw this question I was shocked. I literally had no idea what to write; it seemed different from any past question 5 I had seen before. I feel like I missed the question - I was wasting a lot of time thinking about what to write so I just went for the first cliche idea that popped into my head. What are your thoughts? I feel as if there is a lot of room for improvement here, as an A* predicted student.",null,0,null,1433014173,null,0,1433014400,0,crq4ry3,null,t3_37txz3,null,t1_crq4ry3,null,t3_37txz3,null,null,null,1433396805,null,1,false,GCSE,t5_2u3gk,1,null

In fact, the only top team that I can think of that doesn't play with a physical striker that can get on the end of crosses is Barca, and they have the 3 of the top 10 or 15 strikers in the world. 

And yes we had Suarez that could bully defenders, but he was never ever gonna be able to win a header against one, and ultimately that's what lost us the league title. The fact that Chelsea could just pack the box with 9 men and we had no way through and no hope of winning a header was what showed how one dimensional we were. And it's what cost us this season as well, teams know that they just have to defend deep and stay organised and unless we score a wonder goal we can't do anything about it. 

If we do sign him, he's not exactly going to be upfront on his own either. With Coutinho, Ibe, Lallana, Markovic, Henderson, possibly Milner and Sterling if someone can talk some sense into him, he should have much better support than Villa was ever able to give him.

I've not come across it in shops here (not in the UK at the moment) but maybe I overlooked it because I wasn't really looking for it. None of the vegetarian products I've found so far had B12. (or enough B12 to keep me even remotely healthy.) I'm aware of B12 being added to animal food/water and how it ends up in meat and animal products, so far animal products are the best source of B12 I've found because of the amount of B12 in it. I eat cheese, eggs,... I drink milk, but despite all that I still ended up deficient. The B12 in the meat the rest of my family now eats makes all the difference (not just for B12 but also for iron), and I can't seem to replace it without at least a 2000mcg supplement or eating meat just like them. (I'm obviously going with the first option) 

What my mom used to do was cook non-vegetarian meals and simply take out the meat. Lots of years of getting a bit of it but not nearly enough tend to add up eventually. I'm much more informed now than I was as an 8 year old, and I know that I should supplement. It was already too late by the time I noticed something was off though. My biggest fear with all this promoting of vegetarianism and veganism is that people will do what my mom did. Stop eating meat without knowing what was in that meat and what kind of vitamins should be supplemented as a result of that. It's quite dangerous, especially when the kids are dragged into it. When your parents do something when you're that young you don't question it unless you feel really unhealthy, which you won't for several years. 13 Years in my case because it went so slow I didn't actually feel it. I was 8, but my youngest sister was a baby and didn't get to eat any meat (or supplements) and as a result of that got no B12 till she was 8. That's why I would still prefer it if people ate less meat rather than completely dropping it. I just can't imagine every vegetarian being informed, not if they went vegetarian without doing lots of research just because they read about it in a newspaper... If you've done your research it's a great lifestyle though, you'll never hear me say otherwise! For my own kids I'd rather play safe and give them meat once a week or so. B12 and iron deficiency is just too dangerous, it's a risk I'm not willing to take. They can make an informed decision when they're old enough to understand the dangers and take responsibility.

Yet: public opinion is very much in favour of renationalisation. How our electoral system and government structure enables major parties can get away with ignoring the will of the people is a different topic entirely! :)

not sure these answers are much help, but i will try

1: there's a bus that goes right from where the 'halls' are on campus to the centre of Brighton, guessing it would take about 30 mins. and during the day they are about every 6 mins. there's also a train, the station is at the edge of campus furthest from halls, takes about 9 mins to central brighton, and there is one every 15 mins or so.

I think there might be some halls and uni owned housing in the centre of the city, which may be a good option. otherwise, if you go with a private landlord you might need to find housemates in advance (unless you can afford to live by yourself) and need to sort out various bills for electricity, broadband etc.

2: Brighton is generally considered an expensive city. not as expensive as london, but like oxford and cambridge it's up there as an expensive place.

for buses see http://buses.co.uk/tickets/student-fares.aspx 

for the cost of food, try http://www.sainsburys.co.uk/sol/index.jsp and searching for various things to get a feel.

a telephone line (needed for broadband, unless you use virgin media cable) is about £14 a month, and broadband itself it about the same on top (but you can often get deals for the first few months, see https://www.plus.net/ for some examples).

A coffee in a cafe will start at about £2.

A pint of beer between £3.50 - £4.90

a bottle of wine in the supermarket will be about £6-£8

The Duke of York cinema (more art/world films) a student ticket is £9 
https://www.picturehouses.com/cinema/info/Duke_Of_Yorks#ticket-prices


there are loads of great local resturants in brighton, can't think of many cities with more. and obviously prices vary a lot, but you can often eat out for around £10 at places that are at the budget end (though by no means awful) 

For reference, probably the most common resturant in the UK is pizza express 
http://www.pizzaexpress.com/our-food/our-restaurant-menu/mains/?rid=46

I really like the Prince George
http://www.princegeorge.pub/sample-food/veggie-menu
(oddly you have to click the link at the bottom for the menu to show)

3: lots of people have bikes. and plenty of second hand shops. the route to campus, lewes road, has a cycle lane which has recently improved, though runs along side a busy road and a few busy junctions. brighton is very hilly though the route from the centre to campus is quite flat (there is a gradual slope going away from the sea). lots of bike stands on campus, but they do get full at times during the day. make sure you buy a decent lock!

&gt;Twelve years on, and we can now see the results of this experiment. Rather than afford better protection for the women, it has simply increased the market. Rather than confine the brothels to a discrete (and avoidable) part of the city, the sex industry has spilt out all over Amsterdam — including on-street. Rather than be given rights in the ‘workplace’, the prostitutes have found the pimps are as brutal as ever. The government-funded union set up to protect them has been shunned by the vast majority of prostitutes, who remain too scared to complain.


&gt;Pimps, under legalisation, have been reclassified as managers and businessmen. Abuse suffered by the women is now called an ‘occupational hazard’, like a stone dropped on a builder’s toe. Sex tourism has grown faster in Amsterdam than the regular type of tourism: as the city became the brothel of Europe, women have been imported by traffickers from Africa, Eastern Europe and Asia to meet the demand.


http://www.equalitynow.org/sites/default/files/Does_Legalizing_Prostitution_Protect_Women_and_Girls_EN.pdf

* NETHERLANDS: In 2003, the Amsterdam Mayor stated that legalization had failed to prevent trafficking,
saying “it appeared impossible to create a safe and controllable zone for women that was not open to abuse by
organised crime.”i
 In 2007, a government report noted that “pimps [i.e. traffickers] are still a very common
phenomenon.”ii

* NEW SOUTH WALES (AUSTRALIA): One police officer who investigates sex trafficking commented on
the effects of decriminalization: “Although the intention was to provide a safe working environment for sex
workers the reverse has occurred in that pimps and brothel operators were empowered and enriched.”iii

* GERMANY: A 2007 government report stated that the law has “not been able to make actual, measureable
improvements to prostitutes’ social protection” and that “hardly any measureable, positive impact has been
observed” regarding their working conditions.xv The government also stated there are “no viable indications
that the [law] has reduced crime.”xvi

Your point was originally: when white people do something, no one mentions that it's whites; when minorities do something, people mention the minority. To which the reply is: when a majority group commit the majority of something, it isn't remarkable; when a minority group commits the majority of something, *it's worth noting*. But it's even worse than that, because ethnicity *and the discrimination against other ethnicities (whites, Hindus)* is evidenced in the perpetrators' actions *and in their own words*.

Then for this point, which gives absolutely no reason for not mentioning the group:

&gt;[...] this poor group of people with little to no futures who live in poorly educated areas dealing with a society that requires education to succeed.

&gt;Khan hid his life of depravity behind his middle class background. The mortgage adviser lived in a £300,000 house in Moorgate, a favourite choice of doctors from the nearby hospital.

Your profile fits the victims like a glove though.

If poverty was really the factor, wouldn't we see other groups of poor immigrants exhibiting this *pattern* of repeated, systematic, industrial-scale abuse, distinguished by its violence and racism? ***Why don't we see poor whites gang-raping Pakistani children?*** You are utterly delusional if you don't think that if that happened the media wouldn't go on and on and on and on and on and on and on about racist whites.

Your issue with the use of the term ""Asian"" as a codeword is an issue with political correctness that I assume is about avoiding ""Islamophobia"", and/or poor, uneducated white victims who don't know enough geography. 

You don't want ethnicity mentioned. It's been demonstrated over and over why it's relevant both statistically in terms of perpetrators and victims, and in the minds of the perpetrators themselves. Then you don't want the codeword ""Asian"" used because it's too broad; use ""British Pakistani"" instead. But you don't like that either, because it doesn't acknowledge the role of poverty in creating their culture. But poverty is everywhere and this phenomenon is largely confined to this specific community, with precedents in its religion. Never mind that that's no reason not to identify the group anyway.

&gt;That same **culture** is a 40 year difference from Indian **culture** which is the polar opposite... **There is more to play than** religion and **culture**. 

(Ellipses yours, boldface mine.) So... it *is* the culture, but then it isn't.

Public perception is very much that rail privatisation was a bad idea. The politicians in charge now, however, are wedded to free-market philosophies.

HS2 is a totally new build. Obviously there'll be some land, infrastructure and property changing hands from Network Rail, especially at Euston, but Network Rail isn't going to be in charge of the construction or the operation of the track. The company currently in charge of developing the project is HS2 Ltd., a private non-profit company established by the government, but the eventual operating structure will no doubt involve companies which don't yet exist.

FWIW, the Channel Tunnel link is operated by HS1 Ltd., with responsibility for operations subcontracted to Network Rail (High Speed) Ltd., a subsidiary of Network Rail.

&gt;Mirallas, currently at a training camp with Belgium, said he was wanted by Borussia Dortmund and Atletico Madrid in January, but that Everton persuaded him to stay.

&gt;The 27-year-old said: ""Borussia Dortmund and Atletico Madrid were interested, but Everton obliged me to stay at the club.

&gt;""I understood because our young group had performed below expectations. So I had to stay.

&gt;""But in the second half of the season, I was suddenly playing fewer games.

&gt;""There are promises broken and it makes for a somewhat awkward relationship with the coach. Soon, I will have a conversation with him.

null,false,diodesign,null,null,null,"There's lots of things in play that drive down web ad revenue. I think the big one is that, for all the targeting and tracking ad networks do, advertisers are taking a chance when they pay for a slot on a website. 

If you're advertising a hair spray, how many people viewing the ad are your target customer – say, women aged 20 to 39? It's a total waste of money if your ad is seen overwhelmingly by people who could not care less about your product. That's why web ads aimed at the general population cost a few bucks per 1,000 views, whereas TV and print can charge more: if you're willing to buy a copy of the Times for more than a quid every day, you're probably the sort of person who'll buy a 100 quid tie – so a tie advertiser knows they've got a better return on investment paying more for a print ad.

It's why Google, Facebook et al really really want to know everything about you. If you're selling soap for men, you want that soap ad shown to your target audience: guys – and perhaps their partners around Christmas or Father's Day time. It's why targeted mobile ads are a thing. It's why everyone wants your email address. It's why websites are desperate to profile their visitors just like newspapers and broadcasters build up profiles of their readers and viewers.

It is a lot easier to sell valuable ads if you are a specialist publication: if you're catering for engineers, or lawyers, or cat owners, you can charge a bit more because you can guarantee to advertisers that you've got people who are interested in particular products. And you'll need to charge more because your circulation/traffic/viewing figures will be lower than mass-market populist outlets.

tl;dr: a lot of web advertising is spray-and-pray compared to targeted TV + print ads, so web ad impression rates are kept low to make up for the scattergun approach.",null,0,null,1433017883,null,0,false,0,crq6m7i,null,t3_37tqzo,null,t1_crq6m7i,null,t1_crpx6a1,null,null,null,1433397744,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

&gt;**Since the Prostitution Act only represents a very limited approach, the new Act can only be a first step towards achieving the intended goals of repressing attendant criminality**, improving working conditions, helping those wishing to leave prostitution and increasing transparency in the world of prostitution. 

&gt;In the Federal Government’s opinion, **a more broad-based approach to regulating prostitution is required**. In particular this approach should incorporate the consistent combating of trafficking in human beings, forced prostitution and prostitution of minors, and it should aim to protect prostitutes as best as possible from violence and exploitation and should clearly address the responsibility demanders have, not least by making the clients of those forced into prostitution liable to punishment. 

&gt;**In particular, the existing legal instruments of licensing, trade, police and administrative law need to be used more efficiently and, where necessary, they need to be expanded** in order to subject prostitutes’ working conditions to legal controls to protect those working in prostitution and to prevent attendant crime. 

So, far from urging the  abandonment of legalisation, the report recommends reinforcing it and ensuring that they use current laws more efficiently. 

Take a look at this recommendation:

&gt;The Federal Government, in consultation with the 
Länder, will examine whether and, if so, using which trade law instruments it may be possible to more efficiently monitor commercial enterprises providing sexual services. **In this context it will be examined whether to require brothels, brothel-like establishments and other establishments to apply for a licence to offer sexual services.**

So the fact that these establishments aren't or weren't even operating with a licence is obviously a contributing factor.

null,false,haz633,eng-warwickshire,Warwickshire,null,"I left secondary school in 2008 and I cannot see how it is 'female-centric'. My school had loads of GCSEs in STEM subjects, Maths, Additional Maths, Statistics, Science, Additional Science, IT, Design and Technology, there were loads of opportunities to play sport. They even allowed students to go to the local college instead of doing a D&amp;T subject to do carpentry, plumbing, engineering etc. The teachers were roughly 50/50 male/female.

Boys were perfectly capable of sitting in a classroom 50 years ago and learning a subject, what makes today different? If anything lessons are more 'hands-on' than ever, and nearly every example used in a question is related to football or something to keep the boys attention. We even had English lessons where we were running around outdoors and girls still got better results than boys.

Last year they started removing coursework and focused on end of year exams which apparently should help boys, but it didn't, the gap between boys and girls is still widening. Girls got more A's and A*s in every STEM subject except maths where boys were only ahead by 1.1%

The only reason why people are complaining now is because girls have overtaken boys, I do not think that education has necessarily changed for boys but it has for girls. Girls know they can become something more than a housewife so put more effort into their future. I think many boys are socialised to just expect to land a job straight out of school like their dad or grandad did, but things have changed, they need to start working hard.

The original structure of TOCs at privatisation had far more of them.

There's also no-longer-in-existence operators which had a relatively good reputation.

All of those strikers make the defenders fear them. Make the defenders work extremely hard. When Benteke is on form he can absolutely do that. All of those strikers can play multiple ways. They can play with their feet and have at least decent ability in the air, and can all run in behind. Benteke is obviously different because he is more physical but he definitely has technical ability and has shown that he can play well in a counter attacking side. He's more than just a target man you lump long balls up to, though you wouldn't have known it the way Villa played today.

And I don't think we should sign a striker like Benteke just to bully defenders, but because we need someone that stops defenders from just sitting in their box and watching us pass it around, unable to do anything. That's what made us so one dimensional this season and what we tried and failed to address last summer. Everyone said we needed an option for when teams park the bus. But we bought the wrong players. If all we get are strikers that fit Rodgers system, we will fail to address it again. 

Again I want to stress that I think they're are better buys than Benteke for the price being quoted, I'd much rather we at least try and tempt someone like Jackson Martinez, Higuain, even Aubameyang.

OK, but that's not the same thing as allowing that there may be faults with the movement.  Apologists are generally happy to condemn 'the actions of a few' without conceding that those actions have any link to the beliefs of the many.  And that's precisely what Jones is doing.

&gt; Party must return to fighting poverty, inequality and injustice

&gt; Too many voters think Labour is no longer a movement for social justice but a machine that only kicks in to gear at election time

&gt; As we watch this Tory government dismantle the welfare state, destroy the lives of our young people and demoralise the public sector, never more has Britain needed the fire for change and faith in an alternative.

Yeah Im going to have to disagree with you there on that.
 I have met *many* Tory voters that always bang on about ""benefits families with loads of kids""

Everytime They do their argument is the same simplistic shite I hear over and over again, "" I cant afford that many, the government should stop them from having so many kids!""

Most are honest and admit they want to sterilize the poor. I think you would be surprised too if you asked about.What is the end point of their social cleansing already happening. Too poor to live here, well what happens when they're too poor to live *ANYWHERE*? Do you think these people will finally relent? 

The rest if my post loosely talks about alternatives to the problems arising in an economy with a baked in permanent unemployed class, no full employment policy, universal child benefit and whether social cleansing is really the answer to problem of a minority of people let down by the government and economy abusing the welfare state when the aggressive tax avoidance is a much bigger problem.

The welfare state was abused to save the neo liberals from making tough choices, it was relied upon by them to cushion the move to a post industrial economy that the neo liberals demanded as they did not want to re invest in industry to compete with the world.

Now the same neo liberals are sacrificing the welfare state for merely existing in this world they have created by pointing at a minority of people who have slipped through the gaps in their world into welfare.",null,0,null,1433021513,null,0,false,0,crq8cxy,null,t3_37uchw,null,t1_crq8cxy,null,t1_crq6pp4,null,null,null,1433398565,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

It's good that more girls are achieving great results at school. But having a huge gender gap is always a bad thing, even if it's the historically more powerful gender who is now on the losing end. How stable do you expect society to be if our schools are spawning hundreds of thousands of kids who have no hope? Especially when we still live in an age where men are expected to be the stronger half in a relationship and are still expected to be the primary breadwinner.

&gt;I think many boys are socialised to just expect to land a job straight out of school like their dad or grandad did, but things have changed, they need to start working hard.

I don't think anyone ever says they expect to get a good job straight out of school anymore except ironically. Perhaps sardonically is more appropriate.

Whilst all that was going on I have provided care and education for thousands of children and supported their families. I have made a positive impact in a lot of lives. On a major part of my employment training (I was told later) my work was routinely marked down so as not to embarrass  the rest of the (99% female) student body. My work has been used to teach others and my story is told in some universities.

But I am burnt out and what beat me in the end was female cliques. Female narcissism pervaded the workplace allowed to thrive by weak management, both male and female. As I was in the midst of my final breakdown at work my female manager told me, Maybe I couldn't, ""work with strong women"". I have worked successfully with many strong women, but having removed their last victim the banshees had their claws into me and I had no support and no fight left in  me. This behaviour is not an example of strength.

Although I am happy that I did good work in my life, rather than getting easier to deal with the office politics it got harder. I didn't feel safe and I didn't feel the children were safe, and I had no way to protect them.

Generally, I would leverage what you have, get a foot in *somewhere* and start from there. With that experience in lecturing/teaching, I would consider the possibility of being a Trainer. Call centres are always needing trainers to run the classes that e.g. Teach basic tech support to the Tier 1 guys. Then try to get into consultancy companies - the IT solutions they roll out need trainers to write and deliver the courses to the people who will be using them. Some of the better consultants I've worked with started off as trainers. No IT degrees either in some cases, one had chemistry.

Qualification wise you can always pick up the self study ones along the way. I've got a few Microsoft Development Certs under my belt, they're useless in a real sense IMO if I'm to be blunt but some places like them. Then you've your A+, Network+ etc exams. You basically get the books, self study, and pay the exam fee at a testing centre like Prometric or Peason Vue (BT Riverside tower has both). Pass, get certificate. If you work somewhere you can sometimes get them to pay the exam fee for you if you ask nicely.

And another popular tactic!  Claim that whatever criticism is applied to your group applies equally well to their ideological opponents.

&gt;Point being, it's not the political orientation that causes this behaviour, that just changes who it's aimed at/what circumstances cause it

And another!  Claim that the ideology is not to blame, explaining that the root cause is due to other factors.

I'm not trying to mock you here -- I'm just trying to point out how ideologies are so often shielded from criticism and how their defenders will always find a way to exempt their ideology from blame.

Personally, I'm generally center-left, but I've also become increasingly critical of ideological thinking, whether it's political,  religious, or other.  Why do we need ideologies? And why do we even need to consider ourselves as part of a left or right-wing?  Just think for yourself and try to determine what you think is true and what the best course of action is.

Aviation started out with what you originally described as quite ""masculine"" virtues: the captain was king. In the 1930s a captain would turn a flying boat around because he hadn't got the right number of sugars in his tea. 

[After a number of high profile accidents](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_European_Airways_Flight_548) this was questioned and the concept of [CRM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crew_resource_management) transformed the industry. 

IMO this is a transformation that can't happen too quickly to the rest of society. If a few gender roles have to be sacrificed on the way it's a small price to pay.

You will be glad you decided to live on campus, living in town will be much better when you can move in with friends you met in first year. Wouldn't bother with a bike as it's a good 30-40 minute ride to town and the main times you'll be going into town will be drinking (bad idea) and shopping (too much to carry).

LIVERPOOL are exploring alternatives to Brendan Rodgers, adding to uncertainty about whether the manager will survive an end-of-season review.

He is to be appraised on his performance during 2014-15 in a process led by Mike Gordon, the executive from Fenway Sports Group with most responsibility for day-to-day business at Anfield.

Rodgers and Gordon have a good rapport and the manager remains appreciated by others in Liverpool’s hierarchy, but that has not stopped other options being explored.

A process is under way of examining the availability and credentials of other candidates, such as Jurgen Klopp, whose reign at Borussia Dortmund ended last night after the German Cup final, which Dortmund lost 3-1 to Wolfsburg. Klopp has indicated he would consider the Liverpool job – despite initially saying he planned a sabbatical when his time at Dortmund was over.

*It is thought Rodgers still has a very significant chance of remaining in charge, provided he can satisfy FSG that a disappointing 2014-15 campaign – where Liverpool finished sixth in the Premier League and performed badly in Europe – was a blip. Inside the club, the expectation is Rodgers will still be manager when next season begins.*

Embarrassing defeats in Liverpool’s final two games, a 3-1 home loss to Crystal Palace and 6-1 humiliation at Stoke, have increased the pressure on Rodgers. *However, Liverpool are pressing ahead with attempts to sign Christian Benteke, Nathaniel Clyne, James Milner and Danny Ings – all targets favoured by Rodgers.*

*Gordon is due to meet Rodgers, who is on holiday in Spain, in the next fortnight.* An American, he is FSG’s second largest shareholder after John W Henry, sits on Liverpool’s board of directors, and spends significant periods  in Merseyside.

Rafael Benitez, whose name a number of supporters chanted during the 6-1 defeat at Stoke, will be unveiled as Real Madrid’s new  manager on Wednesday.

*Klopp, who led Dortmund to two German titles and a Champions League final during seven years in charge, is favourite to be offered the job if Liverpool decide to make a change. More than just the manager’s position will be scrutinised in Gordon’s review, with changes considered in Liverpool’s medical department and recruitment structure.*

All children (in my opinion) are entitled to a decent upbringing and to be provided for, even if that ends up being on the government's dime. Poverty breeds crime and if children are brought up in poverty they may have less options to choose from and they may go down that road. I'd rather see children given good childhoods, a proper education and the opportunity to succeed.

That said it's no solution for parents who are just inherently shitty (i.e. spending all their benefit money on cigarettes and alcohol instead of stuff for their kids) but the good parents out there (and their kids) would definitely be benefitting from the... well, benefits. I think what I'm trying to say is that the shitty parents shouldn't be used as an excuse to axe benefits for all the parents out there who need them.

Dortmund have had a shite season, but look at the send off he got from their fans...it was literally something else, which speaks volumes of the type of coach he is.

Can you imagine the screams of horror from the conservatives if, say, you introduced a rule that said donation over £1000 were not allowed.

The fact is that the conservatives are mostly funded by businesses and wealthy individuals making big donations and Labour is mostly funded through union donations (and, yes, increasingly big donations from rich individuals).

The thing we have to ask is: do we want our political parties primarily funded by the wealthy few. For all the faults of union political funds they are, in effect, grassroots funding.

I would strongly strongly prefer a system of central funding for political parties and a ban on donations for electioneering. Politics should not be a game of whose pockets are deeper. That would mean stopping union labour donations and big money donations. Unions could then fund political funds for their own purposes if they wished.

Honestly, it does give some optimism for next season. It feels that many things that could go wrong with the season did. Even if Balotelli does stay, if we get a good striker and we have Sturridge/Balotelli/[X] to rotate between, that would be really good if Sturridge doesn't get injured.

I highly doubt Sterling is going anywhere this summer, he still has two years left on his contract so at the very least I expect him to play for us next season. Hopefully Coutinho will continue progressing into a star player, Ibe, Markovic and Can can get more opportunities and we can see a healthy Lallana. If we get a midfield duo of Henderson/Milner then that will be fantastic. I think all we'd be missing is another solid fullback.

I think the defense can still learn to play better together but with Skrtel, Sakho and Lovren I think we have a good set for centre backs and honestly we should be more solid with those players at the back.

I still have faith that Rodgers can lead this team to success. However, given the results of his past seasons, he needs to win something next season. Even though the League Cup isn't worth much, at the VERY least that. I think we should take the Europa League seriously as well because it's valuable European experience.

No amount of 'standing united' will get around it - it was decided in westminster, we've got the principle of concent which means we recognise their right to legislate and set budgets for NI, and we can only rearrange what money comes our way.

Where were Sinn Fein when this was being voted in parliment? We only had Naomi Long on NI's end against it. For all Sinn Feins talk during the election campain about being able to get a better deal by abstaining then negotiating as First Ministers with the Prime Minister, well, they damn well haven't. Westminster was the place to make the stand, and they weren't even there.

Not to sound salty, but those arsenal fans deserve nothing, you'd never have believed theyve just won the FA cup by the way they walked around after the game as if they were walking to the tube to get home from a doctors appointment or something. Our fans were great all day and still singing outside in defeat, I genuinely saw at least 1000 gunners fans after the game, and only saw 4 of them visibly celebrating. We may not have the cup to take home, but weve got something those fans will never get or even understand. A real football community, were a football team not a brand! 

Edit: This is a bit unfair to a lot of arsenal fans who actually really cared about this game and the FA cup. Its just a real shame those fans are frozen out by ridiculous ticket prices that are bought by rich middle aged men who don't really care but use it as a fashion accesory. The demographic of the fans there really surprised me and I actually do feel a bit sorry for the die hard fans that didnt get a chance because of the pricing of London teams, epsecially arsenal. Just happened to be at the final there were none of those fans and its especially hard to see so many villa fans heart broken, losing against a team in which the cup seemingly meant nothing to the fans (im sure they were happy, but come on you just won the FA cup 4-0 sing a song or something).

null,false,DeusBex,null,null,null,"Exactly! One of the flaws of their campaigning in the General Election 2015, in my opinion at least, was that rather than focusing on key policies they seemed to constantly reiterate this weird ""the Tories are awful and Labour blew all of our money, so just vote for the guy in the middle"" ethos. However, especially as our politics evolves past the three-party system as the Greens and UKIP become more respectable parties, this simply won't work. There needs to be, although it might sound rather obvious when you consider the name, a real push that ""we are liberals and this is what liberalism actually means"".

There are so many people, whom I know of personally or I read of on Reddit, who unknowingly agree with the Liberal Democrats but nonetheless go onto vote for other parties. Ask anyone about their opinion on Conservative plans for internet snooping, for example, and I'd wager that the majority would actually take the liberal stance here. Issues like this, for starters, are key ways to push the Liberal Democrats as a party that looks after everyone and their rights. For me, it's partly why I like them as a party. Civil liberties are important to us all, regardless of whether we're a worker or even a multimillionaire. Internet rights in particular, furthermore, tend to resonate with youth: a group that they've seemingly lost after their failed tuition fees promise.

As well as pushing this idea for civil liberties, however, there does need to be more. Many parties, after all, are adopting somewhat liberal or equality policies as even most of the Conservatives nowadays are supporting same-sex marriage. Economic liberalism, atop of just social liberalism, is one area in which the Liberal Democrats can truly stand apart. Whereas the Conservatives seemingly favour big business and bankers, whilst Ed's Labour attacked the wealthy as somehow being ""predators"" for the poor, a liberal viewpoint can strike a real balance here. True economic liberalism involves promoting a free market, which generally benefits people. Although most gasp in horror at the US healthcare system, and I'm not saying we should ever adopt such a system, the free market there encourages competition and so it's why most of the ""revolutionary"" new treatments start out in the US. That's one example of a benefit that it can bring. At the same time, whilst encouraging the free market, there needs to be ways of preventing monopolies and encouraging new business. This can come, in part I think, from their frequent focus on education policies.

Finally, the party is called the Liberal Democrats for a reason. Atop of a liberal agenda, there needs to be a focus on the democratic part and this idea of fairness. Policies like voting reform so that everyone's voice truly matters, even if they live in a ""safe"" area, can come into this. Housing too, like you said, can also come under this umbrella I think. Promote a welfare system that is fair and, further to this, spread the ethos of investing in people. As you said rather well yourself, we don't want benefits to exist as a way of placating the poor. If we want to call ourselves a truly free and equal society, then we need to increase social mobility. People need opportunity, regardless of their background, to better themselves and strive for greatness. As someone with family and just general first-hand experience in deprived areas, I can safely say that hopelessness is perhaps the most saddening aspect of poverty. You have young men and women who know that, because of their background, achieving anything will be next to impossible.

Whilst I agree that the Liberal Democrats have never been particularly favoured by the media, especially since so much of it in this country is owned by Rupert Murdoch: the man with a million votes, I don't think that means as a party we should totally shun it. There were newspapers like The Independent, unless I'm mistaken, who at the very least wanted the Liberal Democrats to comprise another coalition with the Conservatives. That's hardly having our voice pushed to the side!

That said, I do agree that modern media is arguably more useful than traditional media outlets. Do not underestimate the power of something as trivial as a video going viral on Facebook, for example.

Domestically, under the HRA, it may be fine; the national courts will give the Government quite a bit of wiggle-room when dealing with ""national security"", and won't look into it in too much detail.

In the Strasbourg Court, under the ECHR, things might be different. It depends on whether the Court is feeling particularly privacy-minded at the time, or whether they will defer to the Government. But that could take several years.

Before that we'll probably get some ruling from the Court in the [case brought by Amnesty, Privacy International, Liberty](https://www.amnesty.org/en/articles/news/2015/04/amnesty-international-takes-uk-government-to-european-court-of-human-rights-over-mass-surveillance/) and a few others against the stuff disclosed by Edward Snowden.

Part of the problem with bringing cases in the domestic courts is that few have jurisdiction over the security services, and they have really broad powers (so the HRA is pretty much the only way to challenge their legality). The challenge Liberty etc. brought domestically against the Prism and Upstream programmes demonstrates just how problematic these challenges are; without knowing what GCHQ etc. were doing in detail, the claimants only had the Snowden leaks to go on (although the Government made some disclosures in secret), so couldn't be sure what else they might have been doing. The Tribunal ended up ruling that one of the tools they had (which GCHQ neither confirmed or denied they had used) was in breach of Article 8 due to insufficient disclosure about it and the legal safeguards in place; but that lack of disclosure had been fixed by the disclosures made during the hearings.

Which meant that GCHQ could have been doing illegal stuff... until the Snowden revelations and subsequent legal challenge made them legal.

We don't know what the new law will involve. We don't really know what the Snoopers' Charter would have involved. The law was enabling legislation; giving the Government the power to order anyone to do anything that would be needed for the Government to get access to communications data (or anyone else the Government wanted to have access to data). It went way beyond what we traditionally think of as ISPs, and explicitly covered the postal service.

Meaning that the Government could force companies to install backdoors into their encryption technologies, or require websites like Reddit to keep a log of every single comment or message posted, along with all the associated data. Or... well, almost anything.

Anyway. The stuff about retaining data for 12 months was the stuff in the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act; the one the Government rushed through Parliament last year after the CJEU struck down the EU's Data Retention Directive. That involves requires ISPs to keep for 12 months any data that they kept in the normal course of their business, and provide access to it.

As for the involvement of a public authority, the way DRIP works is that the Government has to issue a ""retention notice"" to the ISP in question, and the issuing of that notice would be subject to the HRA, so that would be a way in.",null,0,null,1433030179,null,0,false,0,crqceq0,null,t3_37u9ec,null,t1_crqceq0,null,t1_crpwf7s,null,null,null,1433489145,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

If defending a little girl crying because English people have been brainwashed into hating the poor is a bad thing, then I'm an asshole.

&gt;Funny, pretty sure there are a healthy amount of conservatives in NI, Scotland and Wales. Plenty, in fact.

I'll refer you to [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/37uchw/family_of_9_evicted_from_their_home_are_first/crqcnrs) where I already proved you wrong on that.

&gt;I do have empathy

No you don't.

You know I'd respect you people if you'd just straight out say ""I don't give a shit about poor children. I just want to pay less tax, so I vote Tory"".

That's at least a logically consistent position. Immoral, but logical.

But when you *pretend* to care but clearly don't- that just pisses me off.

&gt;I have empathy for my mate who's working long hours on minimum wage to support feckless shits like these.

Firstly, **Only 8% of benefit claimants have three or more children**.

To quote The Economist:

""*What evidence there is suggests that, on average, unemployed people have similar numbers of children to employed people ... it is not clear at all that benefits are a significant incentive to have children.*""

But onto your mate...

I'm going to assume that your mate is over 20.

Assuming 40 hours a week, that means in a year he earns (before tax):

40 x £6.50 x 52 = **£13,520**

As the tax free allowance is £10,600, this means he pays 20% tax on £2920 of his income, which means he pays **£584** of income tax.

Families with over 5 children cost the state £2 billion per year. That's for everything they're given. This is **0.27%** of spending, and we are running a 12% budget deficit.

So your mate spends 0.2376% of his £584 income tax on families with over 5 children (""feckless shits like these""), or **£1.38 per year**.

So your mate spends **13 minutes per year** working to pay for ""feckless shits like these"" :)",null,0,null,1433030372,null,0,1433031602,0,crqchy6,null,t3_37uchw,null,t1_crqchy6,null,t1_crqbuoi,null,null,null,1433489188,null,-6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-6,null

No, but they are far far more conservative than anywhere else in the UK.

If you include UKIP, which are a fiscally conservative party too, the total hits **55%**.

I recall him giving Skrtel a torrid time either last year or the year before, just by out muscling him in the air time and time again. Suarez won't do that, and seldom enough the likes of Lewy, Dzeko etc. will do that. They cause problems for defenders many many different ways. The only way Benteke causes problems is with his physicality, because even though he is a fairly good finisher and all around player, he's very far off a lot of players in that respect. Honestly, it seems mad as fuck, but Balo is a far more talented player than Benteke. It's just Balo is daft as fuck!

It's very easy for a team who wants to park the bus to deal with a team that wants to use a target man or an out ball, they practically invite that kind of football. A team that parks the bus will be confident in their ability to stop the opposition, so balls launched in on top of them is what they want. What they don't want is a team that is going to try and play expansive football and wear them down. Benteke won't expand the play and help us break teams down. 

What Benteke will offer us is some goals though, I've said elsewhere that I've no doubt he will score a few. But it's absolutely not worth it at his cost and what we'll have to do system wise to facilitate him. We currently don't really have a system, but Rodgers' ideal plan going into the year seemed to be a 4231 that can morph into a diamond midfield. I'm really not sure Benteke would suit that idea.

   First day I spent $20 on FIFApoints and got about 30k, so I made a cheap team and started to play games, then once I got about 30k I bought IF Rodrigo and sold him a day later for 50k, then bought another one for 35k and sold it for 70k about 3 days later. Through playing games and trading like this I had about 120k in the first week. I then didn't really trade much until for a few weeks and when IF Ivanoic was in packs I bought him for 60k and sold him for 130k a week later. At this point I was sitting on 200k, and IF chiellini had come out in packs, bought him for 90k and sold him for around 140k 2 weeks later. Other players I invested in that I can't remember the prices were: IF Lichtsteiner, IF Isco, IF Lacazette. Around TOTY I had about 1.2 million coins. I spent them all on regular gold players cause the market had crashed, I bought every rare gold player from 90- down except for the really expensive ones (high rated PL players, high rated BBVA players). Then about 2 weeks after TOTY I sold my whole club and had around 2.2 million coins. I then made a cheap team and started to invest in TOTY Lahm. I bought him for 1.8 - 2.2 million and would sell him for 2.4 - 2.8 million. I did this a bunch and had around 6 million, because I was making 400-600k on Lahm every time I bought him. Then I traded a few times with TOTY Ramos but the return wasn't as good. Started making somewhat expensive teams after that and just played for fun. Rewind to a few weeks ago I decided to open up packs because RB Ronaldo, MOTM Messi, TIF Suarez were all in packs, and I packed RB Ronaldo after about a million coins. Sold him for 15 million as well as the team I was using at the time and had 20.2 million at the beginning of TOTS. Bought a ton of packs during MC TOTS because I kept packing them and my luck was insane. So this week I decided to yolo it and open a bunch of packs as well because I'm one of those FIFA players that likes fresh players and first owner players. Spent 6 mill this week, about 8 mill last week, and 2.4 million on Hazard, so right now I have 2.7 million coins right now and the first 7 pages of my club are special cards.

null,false,ambivalent_owl,null,null,null,"&gt; Network Rail is an anomaly. It's wholly owned by the government, but nobody is allowed to describe as renationalised because reasons.

More fun facts from the Department of Totally nothing nationalised to see here, guys, nationalised entities don't work but the private sector is great:

[London and Continental Railways](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_and_Continental_Railways) was a company formed to build HS1.  In 2009 it was in financial trouble so the govt bought it.

They've since repackaged and sold off the actual HS1 stuff, mostly, and LCR's current main business is property development on railway lands.  Like the huge Kings Cross regeneration for example.

If you're in London you'll know a couple of things about that, one is that it's already (more than?) half built, two is that it's very successful.  High quality buildings, mix of interesting tenants (Camden Council have an award winning new HQ, CSM art school, Google on the way,etc).  Everything you want a regeneration to be really.

Compare and contrast with a similarly sized opportunity to turn industrial land into badly needed London housing -- the Greenwich peninsula, which is still 90% derelict, because unlike the doomed-to-failure state-owned Kings Cross project, it was sensibly left to the efficient private sector, which.... sat on the land doing sweet fuck all for ten to fifteen years waiting for prices to rise.
