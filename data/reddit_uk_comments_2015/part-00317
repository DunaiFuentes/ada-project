null,null,absinthe-grey,null,null,null,"Screaming at and attacking a dozen Nazi idiots when you are in a group of hundreds does nothing to stop this imaginary rise of Naizism you think may sweep the country.

Here is what another 'liberal' wrote regarding the English and why they would never have become Nazis in 1941. These paragraphs speak specifically to it:

&gt;The phrase that Hitler coined for the Germans, ‘a sleep-walking people’, would have been better applied to the English. Not that there is anything to be proud of in being called a sleep-walker.
But here it is worth noting a minor English trait which is extremely well marked though not often commented on, and that is a love of flowers. This is one of the first things that one notices when one reaches England from abroad, especially if one is coming from southern Europe. Does it not contradict the English indifference to the arts? Not really, because it is found in people who have no aesthetic feelings whatever. What it does link up with, however, is another English characteristic which is so much a part of us that we barely notice it, and that is the addiction to hobbies and spare-time occupations, the privateness of English life. We are a nation of flower-lovers, but also a nation of stamp-collectors, pigeon-fanciers, amateur carpenters, coupon-snippers, darts-players, crossword-puzzle fans. All the culture that is most truly native centres round things which even when they are communal are not official – the pub, the football match, the back garden, the fireside and the ‘nice cup of tea’. The liberty of the individual is still believed in, almost as in the nineteenth century. But this has nothing to do with economic liberty, the right to exploit others for profit. It is the liberty to have a home of your own, to do what you like in your spare time, to choose your own amusements instead of having them chosen for you from above. The most hateful of all names in an English ear is Nosey Parker. It is obvious, of course, that even this purely private liberty is a lost cause. Like all other modern people, the English are in process of being numbered, labelled, conscripted, ‘co-ordinated’. But the pull of their impulses is in the other direction, and the kind of regimentation that can be imposed on them will be modified in consequence. No party rallies, no Youth Movements, no coloured shirts, no Jew-baiting or ‘spontaneous’ demonstrations. No Gestapo either, in all probability.
But in all societies the common people must live to some extent against the existing order. The genuinely popular culture of England is something that goes on beneath the surface, unofficially and more or less frowned on by the authorities. One thing one notices if one looks directly at the common people, especially in the big towns, is that they are not puritanical. They are inveterate gamblers, drink as much beer as their wages will permit, are devoted to bawdy jokes, and use probably the foulest language in the world. They have to satisfy these tastes in the face of astonishing, hypocritical laws (licensing laws, lottery acts, etc. etc.) which are designed to interfere with everybody but in practice allow everything to happen. Also, the common people are without definite religious belief, and have been so for centuries. The Anglican Church never had a real hold on them, it was simply a preserve of the landed gentry, and the Nonconformist sects only influenced minorities. And yet they have retained a deep tinge of Christian feeling, while almost forgetting the name of Christ. The power-worship which is the new religion of Europe, and which has infected the English intelligentsia, has never touched the common people. They have never caught up with power politics. The ‘realism’ which is preached in Japanese and Italian newspapers would horrify them. One can learn a good deal about the spirit of England from the comic coloured postcards that you see in the windows of cheap stationers’ shops. These things are a sort of diary upon which the English people have unconsciously recorded themselves. Their old-fashioned outlook, their graded snobberies, their mixture of bawdiness and hypocrisy, their extreme gentleness, their deeply moral attitude to life, are all mirrored there.
The gentleness of the English civilization is perhaps its most marked characteristic. You notice it the instant you set foot on English soil. It is a land where the bus conductors are good-tempered and the policemen carry no revolvers. In no country inhabited by white men is it easier to shove people off the pavement. And with this goes something that is always written off by European observers as ‘decadence’ or hypocrisy, the English hatred of war and militarism. It is rooted deep in history, and it is strong in the lower-middle class as well as the working class. Successive wars have shaken it but not destroyed it. Well within living memory it was common for ‘the redcoats’ to be booed at in the streets and for the landlords of respectable public houses to refuse to allow soldiers on the premises. In peace time, even when there are two million unemployed, it is difficult to fill the ranks of the tiny standing army, which is officered by the country gentry and a specialized stratum of the middle class, and manned by farm labourers and slum proletarians. The mass of the people are without military knowledge or tradition, and their attitude towards war is invariably defensive. No politician could rise to power by promising them conquests or military ‘glory’, no Hymn of Hate has ever made any appeal to them. In the last war the songs which the soldiers made up and sang of their own accord were not vengeful but humorous and mock-defeatist(1). The only enemy they ever named was the sergeant-major.

I once tried to track down the artist but I never found him. Still, they are interesting curiosities, and OP is more or less right in what he said, it seems more likely that the artist was never given the show to watch or pictures to look at.


It's not just Japan either, several other localisations have weird and interesting covers and illustrations (these Japanese ones have illustrations of a different Doctor inside too).

Everyone has their potential limited, why should Sita be any different? Where is my petition to send me to medical school? What, just because it might take the lecturers more time and effort to teach me compared to other students means I shouldn't be there? Well... yes, I probably shouldn't be there.

&gt; She deserves the same opportunities as any other young person

She does indeed, and has had them, but unfortunately she cannot take all the opportunities available to her. In fact, this petition is giving her opportunities other young people don't get - again, where is my petition to go to medical school? Or in fact everyone's petition to go to medical school? Just because a person is nice and lovely doesn't in any way mean they should get education they are not suited for. As other comments have said, perhaps she hasn't got the required abilities for the course?

&gt; it's easier for them

Have you ever heard of a point of diminishing returns? If it takes disproportionate time, effort and resources to enable someone to do something that other people can do for much less time, effort and resources then other people are going to pay the price.

&gt;Mature Candidates: The School welcomes applications from mature candidates, but will take account of the length of undergraduate and postgraduate training which has to be undertaken. In addition, we expect that no more than four years has elapsed since the most significant and relevant qualification.
http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/undergraduate/courses/med/medicine.aspx#CourseDetailsTab

The website also makes mention of relevant experience when applying:

&gt;When we are deciding whom to invite for interview, academic excellence is not our only criterion. Therefore it is important for you to demonstrate your motivation towards a career in medicine and are able to show evidence that you will be able to acquire the values of the NHS (including: working together for patients; respect and dignity; compassion; commitment to quality of care; resilience), through people-focused work experience or volunteering.

&gt;It is essential that you provide evidence of an understanding of working in a healthcare environment and an on-going commitment to medicine. For UK nationals and for international applicants living or studying in the UK for more than one year this evidence will relate to the National Health Service (NHS). The types of experience that we value include voluntary work in a nursing home, care home, hospice or hospital volunteer.

I play as a keeper at a reasonable semi pro level and I always have a man inside the back post and a man off the front post in the hole. 50% of corners are headed away by the front post man (the ones that are too short and low for me to collect) and I've been saved multiple times by a goal line clearance from my back post man.

Obviously it means that we need another couple back to pick up the opposition leaving us short for a potential break, but number one priority with defending a corner is to protect the goal, not score from a break. 

It's something I've always noticed us do and now that we've conceded from it, it's frustrating.

The Conservatives are enacting policy that many people find morally objectionable and yet it was in their campaign and they were 'honest' about it.

Are they? My understanding is that the science is extremely weak, and is mainly due to some statistical work that doesn't actually reach the 95% confidence interval.

A simple Google search will be enough, for example there is this from the Journal of the National Cancer Institute:http://m.jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/12/05/jnci.djt365.full


I am all of favour of the ban on other grounds by the way - smell, choice, etc - but let's not pretend that there is any science here.

Edit: and as I expected people are downvoting this because it doesn't fit with their worldview. Smoking is smelly and nasty and causes health problems if you are the person sucking pure, undiluted, carcinogens into your lungs, twenty times a day, for decades. But the fact is that the ""dangers of second hand smoke"" is a moral panic. You might as well stop people wearing perfume or eating smelly food in the street for all the good it does. I agree with the point of making smoking less acceptable; I disagree with the idea that the best way to do that is to lie about the effects it has on non smokers.

Also, purely financially speaking, it's far better people smoke from an early age.

This wasn't a problem when the life expectancy was 65, but now it's 75-80 it's getting a problem.

Basically there are sadly very real problems with just banning smoking in the short term. That's why the approach has been a lot more subtle, I bet less 16 year olds smoke today than 20 years ago, and I bet even less will smoke in 20 years time.

Details of the incident: 

&gt; Together they managed to knock over a drink while gyrating at The Gable bar in Moorgate.

&gt; When Kirsten Barker angrily branded the pair “f***ing idiots” and poured a drink over Drew, he responded by pushing her to the floor.

&gt; Drew then shoved away her friend Hanish Lodhia when he tried to intervene and threw a glass at his face.

&gt; Mr Lodhia was left covered in blood with a gash on his forehead, while a shard from the shattered glass cut the throat of a third victim, Juliette Keyte.

At sentencing ..
&gt; He wept as Recorder Jonathan Cohen spared him a prison term and sentenced him to 12 months’ imprisonment suspended for two years.

&gt; Brent Martin, defending, said Drew was horrified by the attack when shown the CCTV by police, and voluntarily checked himself in for counselling. In a character reference Neil Brown, a global retail sales manager at M&amp;G, said Drew’s future at the firm was hanging in the balance. He will keep his job following the sentence, but will face disciplinary proceedings. Mr Brown told the court: “If I thought for one minute there was likely to be a repeat of this incident, he would no longer be working for M&amp;G.”

and...

&gt; Drew was ordered to pay £460 compensation to Mr Lodhia for his blood-soaked clothes, prosecution costs of £1,000 and a £100 victim surcharge. He must also do a rehabilitation course and 100 hours of community service.

Sounds like a stupid mistake made by someone who had way to much to drink. Throwing a glass at someone is one of those things that in a drunken state doesn't seem serious but really really is. Honestly I think 100 of community service and a suspended sentence is appropriate punishment for such circumstance.

But I guess if he has money he deserves to hang, am I right? /s

Great question!

""Enterprise"" is a vague term.  It's really more what you do with the core language skillsets and your level of expertise, but you certainly expect to see a lot more Java, .Net and SQL in the enterprise than in the startup market.  There's ""Enterprise"" developers in most any language though.

If recruiting for a (non-team-lead) developer at the top of a salary scale for a non-existent made-up job at a software consultancy, I would be looking for:

*  Proven success on a number of projects, ideally in multiple types of environment (consultancy, in-house, product, integration etc)
*  Succeeding at hard problems where failure is possible on multiple occasions, not just a succession of pet store apps
*  Design patterns like it's a second language, not like you just revised them
*  Languages: At least one big boys language.  Usually Java, .Net or C++, would also accept Perl.   At least one prototyping or scripting language.  Ruby or Python preferred.  HTML5 and JavaScript, because everyone thinks they can do those.  If the job is a front-end job, then actual JavaScript with JQuery and at least two other frameworks.  Most importantly, I'm looking for the ability to learn a new language to a journeyman level in two or three days.
*  Ability to design and defend those designs, not just implement
*  Automated unit and end-to-end testing, test design
*  Knowledge of PRINCE2, Scrum and ideally Kanban
*  Requirements management.  Ability to be left alone with customers.
*  Basic commercial awareness.  Software estimation techniques and why they are all terrible
*  Willingness to travel

The above gets you in the door as a £60K-£100K developer and I haven't really started on infrastructure or architecture.

What I'm trying to demonstrate by the above list is the difference between a top software engineer, who brings a range of technical and non-technical skills to your team, and someone who can program an IOS application, even if they're pretty good at it.  The latter is still valuable, and many of us started in that position (not that you had IOS when I were a lad), but it doesn't command the highest salaries.  One of the reasons for this, incidentally, is that most IOS applications are pretty straightforward.  There's important exceptions, but they're not the majority.

Key skills to pick up:

1)  Testing and test automation
2)  Scrum, Agile Manifesto, Kanban
3)  Oracle or PSQL
4)  Java or .Net

Secondly, who honestly cares if they're lying or not. Taken at base value, I assume that no one willingly wants to be subject to the abuse and various threats that trans people have to suffer on a daily basis. But, let's just assume for a second that there are some people who do want to have to go through all that just for the attention. Who cares?

Being skeptical of everyone who comes out as trans just so you can catch out those just doing it for attention does way more harm than good, it can cause distress to those who are already out, people constantly questioning if they are really trans or 'just faking it' can also discourage people from coming out in the first place.

Incorrect. Read some policy documents please, Boris.


&gt; Mili and co also shifted Labour so much to the Left that they managed to give a kind of spurious legitimacy to the Corbyn agenda. Miliband adopted wholesale the Livingstone playbook of state-enforced price freezes and rent controls and other attempts to buck the market. 

Conveniently forgetting [Labour weren't the only party](http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2015-32245068) to borrow from that playbook (although this is admittedly already regulated). The idea that Labour shifted massively to the left is not very plausible, either, especially not to such an extent that 'Corbyn is explicitly the heir of Miliband' - Miliband's 'one nation labour' is vastly different from the hard left positions espoused by Corbyn, whether on the economy, on foreign policy, or many other issues.

&gt; The third set of villains is, of course, the other candidates, who have been so robotically dull that they have made Jeremy’s woolly ruminations seem positively electrifying.

Well, I agree with this at least. Frankly, aside from the statement that Corbyn is too left-wing to be electable (an opinion evident if anyone has picked up a paper in the last few weeks), I find his analysis of the entire situation entirely lacking. 

edit: I should also add that Corbyn is not completely silent on welfare reform, given his suggestions for properly integrating adult education into the Jobcentre.",null,0,null,1439762695,null,null,1439765611,0,cu5980h,null,t3_3h8hx3,null,null,null,t3_3h8hx3,null,null,null,1441289673,null,12,null,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,12,null

I must add though for housing that property prices were irrelevant,  the housing that was produced can only be described as concrete anderson shelters, the country was bombed to shit and we had a load of reconstruction money in the form of the marshall plan.

It is used to describe those that are white European and have ancestry on these islands going back millenia. All the groups you mention came here before Maoris arrived in New Zealand from Polynesia (about the same time or just after Normans arrived in Britain). Would you dare question their right to call themselves native New Zealanders? NO of course not.

And you make out as though they are all different. Very few Romans stayed in Britain, and the Anglo Saxon, Vikings, Normans and Danish are ALL THE SAME PEOPLE! The Anglo Saxons were from southern Denmark, The Vikings that came later were from the same area of Europe, the Normans were Vikings that had settled in Northern France. NORMAN comes from Nordmenn, which to this day is what they call themselves in Norway. The Danish the same. All these came over 1000 years ago and were northern European. Even in 1500 the British population was estimated to be just 2 million people, so yes there is indeed such a thing as NATIVE BRITISH. Just as there is native people in all lands across the planet. It is our ancestors that built this country from the Canals, to the bridges, to the mines in Cornwall, to the stone walls in the Dales to the buildings in Liverpool!

Sadly, most of them aren't actually satirical or at least don't make it anywhere near obvious it's satire.

&gt;To me, reddit's (TiA's) obsession with dragon-kin and the whole 'I identify as attack helicopter' joke is just thinly veiled transphobia and a desperate attempt to attack feminism. (Sorry for the rant)

It's not making fun of trans people or feminism, just people that identify as something that isn't actually human. Claiming to be part cat doesn't make you trans, it makes you either a troll or needing therapy.

&gt;Secondly, who honestly cares if they're lying or not.

You asked why someone would lie, I gave you a reason. And if they're lying it's probably because of underlying problems that could be fixed with a bit of counselling.

&gt;Taken at base value, I assume that no one willingly wants to be subject to the abuse and various threats that trans people have to suffer on a daily basis.

Attention is attention, especially when it's from somewhere like Tumblr where the abuse is minimal against trans people. 

&gt;Being skeptical of everyone who comes out as trans just so you can catch out those just doing it for attention does way more harm than good, it can cause distress to those who are already out, people constantly questioning if they are really trans or 'just faking it' can also discourage people from coming out in the first place.

I'm not skeptical of anyone, you asked why someone would pretend to be trans and I answered it: For the attention that comes with being unique and victimised.

&gt;How hard is it to just treat everyone who says that their trans as if they are actually trans? So what you'll be giving a few people some undeserved respect and attention, it's not like you only have a limited amount of attention to give.

I agree completely, the amount of people who pretend is low enough to not really be a problem and you shouldn't claim or act like they're pretending even if you're 99% certain they are.",null,1,null,1439763324,null,null,false,0,cu59jv7,null,t3_3h6uwo,null,null,null,t1_cu5977q,null,null,null,1441289827,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Then 2007/08 came and we were awful. Our hopes and dreams, so inflated by recent success, were crushed. Our defence was a mess and the keeper behind them was worse. Until Ramos came in, we were a serious relegation candidate.

2007/08 pre-Ramos hurt more.

Soldado, even when missing chances, would link up well. Lamela ran around on the right, misplacing passes, giving away free kicks and losing the ball. He had a negative impact. Soldado wouldn't negatively impact our build up play, even if he'd fuck up the finish.

Stoke Bishop halls are just off the northern tip of the Downs and if you want to get to lectures from there, you will have to walk across the fields daily. Pro tip - the walk across those fields in the morning is a *great* hangover cure. I believe there's now a bus that goes from Stoke Bishop to the main precinct - so if it's raining and you don't fancy the walk, you could always take that. 

There have been reports of rape or sexual deviancy, as well as attacks, there at night - it's basically pitch black as there's little to no streetlight.

Then say 15% on businesses with profits of £1mil to £5mil.

Then raise the corporation tax to 25% on £5mil to £20mil, and say 40% on £20mil+

These are just numbers pulled out of thin air as an example, but something along these lines would not only increase tax revenue by quite a bit, it would also be a significant tax cut for a lot of small and mid-sized businesses. 

I could see something like that being quite popular with small business-owners, a fair number of whom see the current system as unfairly favouring the most successful multinational corporations.

Reasons:

1. Just because (and with honesty, that's the main one).
2. I don't want scraping 4th and getting into the Champion's League to be our be-all and end-all like it has been for Arsenal all these years. I want us to win stuff.
3. There are 4 teams with mega financing and 4 teams in the Champions League. It's too cosy. Going down to 3 places would throw the spanner in the works of a set-up that is *not working to our advantage*. It's a cat amongst the pigeons, and chaos is a ladder. If those other teams can't guarantee Champions League revenue season after season, maybe their business models will have to change.
4. Possibly I'm just rephrasing (3), but as the fifth-richest club, our plan seems to be that we accept fifth place as par (Brendan said as much) but are the ones in the best position to benefit should the *status quo* change. So let it change.

Chicken breast is the most bland part of the bird! The thigh is really tasty, more commonly being cooked on the bone helps, and the leg is good.

The general principle of using cheaper cuts is an excellent one. Chilli with shin of beef, or lamb broth with a whole shoulder on the bone.

Either of those make a heap of superb single-portion frozen meals, and a large lasagne is also great for freezing in single portions and reheating in a microwave.

Good question. Saddam Hussein ruled a nation of around 20 Million people so he could not have murdered more people than Hitler or Stalin. But when it comes to how 'stabby' a dictator is Saddam Hussein is worse than Hitler and almost on par with Stalin. 

Hitler and Napoleon had charisma and social skills to get on with people so they could establish friendship and trust with their inner circles and their charisma made them favourable with the people, But would get 'stabby' if they had to, Hitler and Napoleon leadership types are known as ruling with an iron fist but covered in a velvet glove.

For me everything that can be summed up about his Premiership was in [2008](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-12023054). Food banks were starting to co-operate with Job Centres to provide people with food parcels. Brown passed a directive prohibiting them from doing so as he would rather thousands of people starve for days on end rather than have one awkward statistic in the press. There's this strange perception that Brown was somehow ""all substance, no style"", he actually did try and spin just as much as Blair, it's just that he wasn't any good.

Thankfully the coalition undid that particular law in their first few months in office. Not to mention the fact that the problem was to do with the lack of real time adjustments to benefit which is what universal credit is about whereas Brown spunked away tax credits without bothering to reform the system in such away.

tl; dr no I most certainly don't want Brown back

As for that last statement, you should like a school teacher or some authoriative figure trying to sound like they have some sort of power. Simply put, I do not agree with the idea that a character 'has to change sex' in order to be important nor to fit with it's fan base. There is a 'fad', or idea if you will stemming from the trans community and the like are so overpowering, that has transcended into TV and movie characters. You and other may not have heard it, but it's around.  
As for discussion, I do not use drugs or drink. The Doctor has never been American nor any other nationality outside of the UK. IMO, he never should be played by anyone outside of England. The show is BBC's creation and their decision on who has played; nationality and sex have long been ingrained into the role requirements.  
The Doctor (character only) could be anyone; redneck from the South, California surfer dude, New York Politician type..... Heck let's go further. He could be any male of any nationality around the  world. Why hasn't he since it's inception? BBC made that decision a long time ago.

If he doesn't do well there, then we can expect to brake even, or maybe make a slight profit on him (although after wages it might not even be that). What I'm saying overall is that he might be amazing in the Eredivisie, but not in a top league (which happens far too often), and we won't make a good profit from him. I think more and more teams are wanting players to prove themselves in harder leagues before they gamble with larger sums of money, because it makes so much sense.

To a degree they were justified in deciding to defend themselves and fight back with whatever means were at their disposal. As it progressed it became less and less justified and a lot more brutal.

Tactically however I think they got it arseways and most of the deaths were due to their chosen tactics. They had mass support but decided to just sit their with mass support and do little with it while using small clandestine groups to do the fighting for the masses. 

What they could have done is organise those masses so that they can fight for themselves through other means such as the general strike, boycott and mass civil disobedience. Make the place ungovernable and grind the economy to a halt until they Unionists would have to give in. When the troubles kicked off it was just a couple of years after the May 1968 strike had brought France to its knees. It wasn't an unheard of tactic at the time.

Now, this is all what-ifery and generalised but I see those tactics as far less deadly and much more effective than bombing people and revenge shootings. The War of Independence is seen as being won by the old IRA but do you really think a couple of thousand poorly armed guerillas brought the British to the table? Or did the fact that period was witness to the largest, most militant and numerous wave of political general strikes in Irish labour history have something to do with it?

We need another outside back as Ivanovic has been lackluster and got burned by Montero last week and Sterling today.

Cuadrado being in the 18 today is promising and when he came on he looked better in terms of the parts of his game he needs work on (tracking back, getting back up after getting beat and throwing himself back into the game, etc.).

Falcao needs a start, Costa did decent but was disconnected. I'm not saying this is his fault, but his best two moments were playing Hazard that layoff in the box and then towards the end of the match hitting the post. His injuries worry me and I think it's silly to over work him early in the season especially given the squads form.

And the biggest issue in my honest opinion, is Mourinho going up to post game interviews and saying the team was the best team in the second half. Maybe it's because he wants to back his team, but then again he later blames Ivanovic for poor marking in the Kompany header. 

Chelsea was not the better team. If he thinks they were, that's more of an issue than the lacking enthusiasm of the squad.

Some people are genuinely hungry, when I worked at Tesco duirng high school in the 90s there was a girl who used to come in and steal food weekly. It got to the point where the store detective told her in future rather than shop lift come and find her directly and she'd buy her a meal at the cafe. 

She was the the older sister of a boy in my year at school who been thrown out, the whole story was really sad. She was from a middle class hardcore catholic family Dad was a copper. I told my friend at school I'd seen X's sister caught for shop lifting at work and he told me that through his own sister he found out that girl X had also turned to prostitution to support herself. 

I went and asked the lad in my year about his sister and he just laughed about it as if it was a big joke not taking it seriously at all saying that she'd be back home when she ran out of money. I told him that I'd seen her at the staff reception work because she's been shoplifting that she'd also turned to prostitution and the horror on his face was just straight up chilling.


edit- I don't know how it all worked out, but I'd like to think that there was no way in hell that X's father would have left her  on the street once he'd found she resorted to prostitution to survive. The thing is she wasn't into drugs, didn't hang out with a bad crowd, attendance was a bit crap in sixth form but she was just an average teenage girl with ultra strict parents.

I think it's becoming clear that playing every minute last year took its toll on John Terry. Ivanovic is, as stated everywhere, a centre back by trade. I think Baba (or John Stones) should be on the left (Hazard's side), and moving Dave to the right would help create more tempo and pressure on the team's weak side of the pitch. Ivanovic at his best, is a better and more organized defender than Cahill (Before his 2nd half dip in form last year, Ivanovic was a candidate for POY IMO). I think Zouma needs more playing time and is Chelsea's future at centreback. Pairing him in the middle with Ivanovic would create a strong, powerful back line, with Branislav acting as a surrogate Terry with a step-and-a-half better pace. Does anyone else agree with this postulation?

null,null,Buffaluffasaurus,null,null,null,"A striker's job is to score goals, yes.  But also remember that when we bought Lamela, he'd just come off a 15-goal season for Roma.  We bought him for his ability to score too, not just hit the odd wonder goal and notch some assists.

I don't want to overstate this because I'm not really a Soldado defender, but I think the main difference between the two is that even when Bobby was missing sitters, he was still doing all the things a good striker does.  Movement off the ball was great, link up play was great, and most importantly, he was getting himself into those situations to miss those sitters.

Conversely, with Lamela, unless he's scoring rabonas and getting amongst the assists, you get the feeling he's not really doing any of the things expected of a top class winger/attacking midfielder.  He takes up poor positions, his touch is often heavy, he tries running into opposition players when a pass is a better option, and tries ridiculous passes when a simple holding up of the ball and layoff is the right choice.  So many attacking situations and fast breaks have been completely fucked up by him and his bad choices.  That's not really what we need right now.

Yes, he throws himself around a lot and gets stuck in off the ball, but even then he commits way too many fouls and doesn't have much positional nous in defensive situations.  A high press is all about positional awareness, and only pressing when a specific trigger is activated on the pitch.  Watching Lamela, I don't feel like he obeys the tactical discipline of a high press, and instead just runs around a lot, chasing and chasing with little support and compliance with teammates.

It's not to say he's without any good points at all, but I'd have to say the bad far outweighs the good overall.  I would be surprised if he got into the 15-20 goals + assists range this season in the EPL, which is what he desperately need right now as a club.  He might suddenly gain some on-pitch maturity and incisiveness, but I think a player his age has already showed their hand in terms of potential.  It's not like he's going to suddenly become world class in a season or two I feel, which ultimately is what we thought we were buying.",null,0,null,1439769675,null,null,false,0,cu5cs5s,null,t3_3h8l30,null,null,null,t1_cu5bjc8,null,null,null,1441291416,null,3,null,coys,t5_2ryq7,3,null

We might be able to get away with it if we were to play Ramires behind Costa in order to press their midfielders and not give them the time to pick out a pass in behind. Then that creates problems with Fabregas pushing forward to add creativity which will result in us getting stuck in corners because we can't switch play to the other wing.

Oscar is good at getting in the face of opposition midfielders but I think Ramires will win the ball back more consistently and do it for a longer period of time and be able to pass it back to Matic/Fabregas who can either pick out a runner or recycle possession to the wings and we can just probe back and forth while trying to manipulate their defence to our liking.

Expectations do play a big part - 10th every year for five years would be fine for West Ham, but definitely not for us. That's why, in my opinion, the early days of 2007/08 were darker than the mediocre 1990s.

Some people talk to their teachers/careers advisers, if their plans for post-16 change for whatever reason, or they need clarification on what the results mean. Some people pose for photos for the local newspaper.

Bear in mind that if it's a paper that a lot of people found hard, they will lower the grade boundaries to reflect this.

TPFT (Third Party, Fire and Theft). Also covers your bike against damage by fire or if it is stolen. Note that you will have to declare where the bike is usually kept and how it is secured, and if you are not keeping to that declaration the insurer may invalidate the claim.

(Fully) Comprehensive: Allows you to claim for any damage to your bike, no matter the cause.

All of these will be subject to an Excess, which is where you are liable for the first £x of any claim. By adjusting the voluntary excess, you can reduce the insurance premium somewhat.

That's the basic insurance, now for the extras.

Legal Assistance: covers legal costs up to a maximum in the event of a contested claim.

Helmet and Leathers: covers the cost of replacements when damaged in an accident.

Personal Accident: covers your injuries from an accident.

Breakdown Cover: provides breakdown assistance. Your bog standard RAC/AA cover, usually.

None of these are essential, but certainly not bad to have if you ever need them. You may be able to find similar cover for less elsewhere, though.

I think Costa can't play alone as the only forward, he needs someone to help him and we need to shift to a 4-4-2 instead of the 4-5-1 we usually play with. I think we need either Remy or Falcao to play alongside Costa from the start, so that one of the forwards can pull marks while the other one makes the run for goal. Costa is a beast and for such reason he gets marked incredible heavily and it seems like he has trouble finding a spot to shoot from. In the last 8 minutes when Falcao came in and the City defense had to distribute themselves between both Costa and Falcao we had like 2 shots on target and one more attempt by Falcao from outside that hit a City defender. Before that we only had Hazard's attempt. 

In the back, I fucking love Brana but he's just too slow. He kept getting outrun this whole game just like our previous game.

-Raheem has added this new dimension to our play, were we transition so quickly from defence to attack. Unbelievable 

-We completely dominated them, I loved how second half we let Chelsea have possesion and hit them on the counter

-Our midfield is so energized and able to completely control the game even against IMO the best defensive midfielder, Matic (what a player he is)

-The highest praise to the defence, some of those tackles were amazing. Mangala looked like the player we paid so much for, Kolarov was immense, looked solid defensively and very creative while attacking. Having Raheem makes him attack only when he absolutely needs to, he isn't caught out. Vinne seems like old Vinne, and Sagna shut out Hazard

-The highest highest praise goes to Manuel, got everything right and I'm loving the way he has revitalized the whole squad. Never in my mind, did I question whether he was the right man for the job. I think we as fans need to give him our complete faith, and im extremely happy he is here for 1 more year.

Poch said we have one more striker on the way and everybody is saying it's Berahino, but whether or not it will come off that way who knows could just be sports writers putting 2+2=5 you know. 

I will put this defense in for Fazio, we are absolutely the wrong team for him. I think he is a good player. He's big, strong, and passionate. I fucking love the way he gets in peoples faces to defend his team mates. He is a mountain of a man and can, but doesn't always, dominate the air. One of our best periods last season was when he and Vert were side by side. Now the but, he is slow and slow doesn't work in our system. Poch plays a highline with attacking fullbacks providing most of our width and, until this season, no holding midfielder you put all that together and Fazio was doomed to be exposed. He had no shield last year, plus he spent most of it playing with Dier out on the right in a position I don't think he had ever played until Naughton got sent off with a red card in the first game of the season. So he's in a team, a new partnership, with a player on his outside that doesn't know the position, in system that simply is not suited to his game, I mean...we fucked him over really. I didn't mean for this to get so long, so sorry about that, but I'm realizing just how screwed over Fazio was last season. Anyway, I think he could do really well in a team with a more traditional backline. 

On the brightside, Kane is class. I don't think he'll score as much this season, but he already seems to be creating more and if some of our other players can start scoring I think he'll have a great season.

null,null,szlafarski,lfc99,,null,"His job is to help ensure Bournemouth’s first away match as a Premier League club ends in defeat but few will take more pride in their presence on the historic Anfield stage than Sean O’Driscoll. For 22 years he served Bournemouth as player, coach and manager, a job that involved buying training kit from the market and organising a team photo on a yacht in an effort to keep the club financially afloat. They are part of the reason Liverpool’s new assistant manager “views this Premier League bubble through a different lens”.


O’Driscoll was the surprise appointment as Brendan Rodgers’ No2 this summer when the Liverpool manager parted company with long-time assistant Colin Pascoe and the first-team coach Mike Marsh. Poached from the Football Association, where he had worked as the England Under-19s coach, the 58-year-old is tasked with taking Liverpool “in a new technical direction” with Rodgers. He brings a refreshing honesty and engaging presence to the role after a career outside the precious, rarefied air of the Premier League. It is an outlook forged on the south coast.


“You name it, I have done it at Bournemouth,” says O’Driscoll before his own league bow at Anfield on Monday evening. “It was fantastic when they got promoted and there are lots of people still there I know – players and staff – so I sent them texts the night they came up reminding them about how it used to be. Someone texted me back with ‘Remember Fruit of the Loom?’ We had no training kit, so we went to the market and bought a load of Fruit of the Loom T-shirts. Oh my God. I was manager then. Part of the kit deal was that you got £20,000 worth of training kit but you were being charged a lot for a cotton top. We were looking to save or maximise money, so we decided not to take the money from the kit deal for the training kit and went to the market instead.”

Bournemouth had become Europe’s first community club by the time O’Driscoll became manager in 2000; he had previously made a then record 423 league appearances for the Cherries. Board meetings were not so much romantic as supporters strived to keep their club alive, he recalls, as “a noose around the neck over time because you could never get on. Every man and his dog was in there and there were always factions.” The manager took it upon himself to raise funds.

O’Driscoll explains: “Rather than go into the boardroom and ask for money we tended to do our own thing to raise money. We wanted to make sure we had balls throughout the season, so we did our own team photoshoot. We asked the yacht people, Sunseeker, for help and all got on one of their boats at Poole Harbour, turned it around to face Bournemouth pier, sat everyone down and got a local photographer to take the team shot from a rowing boat. We printed it as our team photo and sold it. The club wasn’t too happy when we outsold the official photograph but we weren’t raising money for a party. It was all for the club’s benefit.”


The former Fulham and Republic of Ireland midfielder admits he has always been challenging of authority. “I was late coming into football, 21 or 22,” he says. “And I didn’t come into it with any ideas of what it was meant to be. My perceptions were different and have been the same ever since. I wasn’t trying to be arsey but I was always asking why we were doing certain things.”

It is that approach, coupled with his work at Doncaster Rovers – the first team Rodgers faced as Watford manager at Vicarage Road – and more challenging spells at Bristol City and Nottingham Forest, that O’Driscoll suspects led to the call from the Liverpool manager’s office this summer. “I had a message to ring Brendan and I thought it was because he wanted to know how Sheyi Ojo had done with England’s Under-18s,” he admits. “I’d also spoken to Brendan and numerous other managers about Joe Gomez – Liverpool’s £3.5m summer signing from Charlton Athletic – because people had asked me. At the time I was surprised that no Premier League club had come in for him.”

O’Driscoll claims Rodgers “wants me to challenge and say what I think about doing things and how we can maximise the talents we have, although you have to be careful how you do it. You have to show respect.”

He also believes it is not only Liverpool who needed the overhaul their manager prescribed with his backroom changes this summer. “You could say that about the whole of the Premier League,” insists O’Driscoll on the desire for a shakeup. “I think it’s a bubble. It’s almost like the outside world doesn’t exist. Inside, it’s awash with money in certain aspects and there are a lot of things you can do which you can’t do elsewhere.


“You attract arguably not some of the best characters but some of the best players in the world. It’s about managing that and trying to get people to understand. They are all talented individuals – if they weren’t they wouldn’t be here – but the danger is they will always do what they have always done. Why would they change?

“They are talented in this bubble, which means they get paid an awful lot of money, although that shouldn’t be thrown at them. With the young English players I’ve worked with, if someone does something poorly on a football pitch the first thing that’s thrown at them is they get paid too much money. Why is that the first thing thrown at a lad? I don’t understand it.

“You want players to think about what they do and to look at things a bit differently but often they think ‘I’m successful and get paid a lot of money – why would I change?’ When I walked in, I had a completely fresh view of things. I’d never worked at this level before. I had a preconception of what it was like in the Premier League but walking into it, it’s completely different. You do things and people will react and play the way they play. I’m trying to get them to look at why they do it.

“I had a job at the FA that I really believed in and when the offer from Brendan came I spent two weeks trying to find someone to convince me not to do it. I could not find anyone.”

null,null,Starlifter141,null,null,null,"I prefer the Doctor’s role as cast. I think the dynamic works best as it is. Changing the Doctor’s gender or race would satisfy one part of the fan base but probably leave a larger portion dissatisfied. If there is a change in the Doctor’s gender or race it should be done because it advances the story and it’s the right actor for the role at the right time. It shouldn’t be changed just to be politically correct, or in response to any one part of the fan base. But such a change would not keep me from watching it.

Poster /u/thoughts-from-alex has a link to an excellent fan film short with a good female Doctor. And since a few posters discussed a non-white Doctor, here are two related fan films with a non-white Doctor. 

The first film is a more humorous take on the Doctor. It sets up some of the characters for the second film, which is a more serious story. The acting, script and film values are all good (except for the Tardis needing some frosted windows in one shot). The costuming will either work for you or not. And let’s just say they incorporate nods to other movies.

Second, we might feel differently about Soldado if he were still in the squad and failing at the same rate.

Make a good impression on your hall cleaner and learn their name. 

The Fresher's Ball was shit when I was a student, although that was ten years ago. It may have improved but I somehow doubt it.

Bring a kettle and extra mugs if you're staying in halls.

Avoid cocktails with humorous names. That's just a general life rule though. Student bar cocktails are generally future headaches in disguise.

**DO NOT HAVE SEX WITH ANYONE ON YOUR FLOOR/ IN YOUR FLAT.** It never ends well. Well ok, maybe one time, a couple I know who started dating in freshers week ten years ago just got married. That's like 1 in god knows how many though.

About two weeks in, everyone is going to get sick. Make sure you get a few early nights in and eat well, all the partying and exploring and going to lectures makes everyone run down and colds spread like crazy. Pack the lemsip before you move into student accommodation and look after yourself.

Get to know the city itself, not just the student parts. There are loads of great areas that a lot of students completely miss during their time here. If you want some suggestions (or epic date ideas) [check out the Bristol Bucket List.](http://bristolfashionista.com/2014/05/07/bristol-bucket-list/)

Don't buy any text books until you check the second hand stores and library.

Always have a pen and notebook in your bag.

The team intrigued me with players like Martin Petrov, Wright-Phillips, and Robinho, as I prefer pacey players. The team clicked with me, unlike all the ""big teams"" at the time (+ the thrill of using a ""small"" club to beat your friends + the excuse of using a ""small"" club when beaten by your friends). Slowly growing to like football with supporting Manchester City is a lot of fun, especially when literally no one where I come from cared about the team, and when they suddenly become a huge team in the near future. I am glad that I did, as it gave me one of the best ever stories in the history of sport: the special, drama-like moments May 13th 2012. Priceless.

You read the article and see the journalist has absolutely no understanding of either the facts or the issues. Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backward–reversing cause and effect. I call these the “wet streets cause rain” stories. Paper’s full of them.
&gt;
&gt; In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story–and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read with renewed interest as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about far-off Palestine than it was about the story you just read. You turn the page, and forget what you know.

* We need more creativity in midfield.

* Ramires and Mikel are not Chelsea quality, we need better midfielders. At least Mikel has taken a much more backseat role, but even then in this situation it was only really him to call on from the bench today and he isn't a game changer in the least bit.

* Ivanovic needs to be more solid on defending or find himself on the bench. He is getting ripped apart and this isn't something new.

* Costa needs to spend less time complaining and more time playing football.

There is literally nothing good that I can extrapolate from this group.  Maybe our backup keeper showed that he was a solid signing. But attacking -- there is no cutting edge whatsoever.  The link up between midfield and attack is missing.  And the team cannot find any width in the final third.  

Look I'm just overreacting I'm well aware of this, but given the way this team limped to the finish line last year I am concerned.

Lastly, when are we going to sort out defending corners and set pieces.  For a team with as much size as ours we should be better.

I do however think this could potentially be very good news, as we may have found our long term solution to our holding midfield position as BR clearly doesn't seem to rate Lucas there going forward. Not only that but I believe that Can could be an absolute world class holding midfielder in the near future as he contains all the raw tools to be an absolute beast at the position. Here's where it gets tricky for me. Glad that BR has announced Can to be the holding mid solution but he needs to develop his reading of the game and there is no better player than Lucas to mentor him. What I'm hoping for is that these comments were not meant to be the final nail in Lucas' coffin as he could be essential in the development of young Emre but also may really be vital to our midfield depth. As I doubt anyone truly saw Allen as a proper holding midfielder, this likely shifts him into the shuttler role with Can taking his spot in the holding role, assuming we play a general 4-3-3 or christmas tree moving forward. As Can is at this point more of a box to box type, if Henderson or Milner were to go down it would be nice to have a proper holding mid to slot in for Can as he takes either of their places, without even mentioning having Lucas for the holding mid role if Can goes down himself. 

With all that being said I think this is a good bit of news, gives more clarification on what BR is likely thinking (no new holding mids at least) and hopefully it isn't the foreshadowing of one of my favorite Reds Lucas Leiva's departure for a number of reasons which I've listed above. I am however extremely excited to see what Can is capable of when fully dedicated to the holding mid role as this has been a problem area we've been asking to be solved for a while now (or at least I have) and Can has all the tools to truly be world class there I believe.",null,0,null,1439792390,null,null,false,0,cu5n2bh,null,t3_3ha8sh,null,null,null,t3_3ha8sh,null,null,null,1441297577,null,36,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,36,null

How is partitioning India into independent states free of British rule not something that ""dismantled the Empire and ended colonial practices""? The Shah was overthrown in 1979, not sure how that's remotely relevant. The Junta in Greece was not a UK design - [we supported King Constantine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_II_of_Greece#Greek_dictatorship_1967.E2.80.931974) who was exiled by the Junta as he made a futile attempt to bring back democracy. Also it came 16 years after Attlee left his position as PM. Any eventual support of the military dictatorship in Greece that came after from UK was strictly cold war politics to prevent them becoming a USSR puppet.

First: Remember that video of matic answering questions with that youtuber? He was asked, who are the hardest workers on the team? His answer, azpi and zouma. He probably would've said himself if he wasn't so humble. It's starting to show on the field.

Second: Every season we always have trouble at some point. This season it's happening now and we don't know how to feel or what to think because it hasn't happened since 98. I'd rather go through a shitty form right now and get the bullshit out of our asses right now, than suffer it later. If We have trouble now and fix it, we might not have that mid-season dip in form like we always have, and we can actually come out on top during crucial stages of cups, league, etc. Yes, there is underlying problems in our squad and performances that have been a reflection of past events and can be a foreshadowing of future events, but I'm optimistic that we're going through a tough time now so that it won't happen later, if that makes sense.

Third: Diego needs to stop being a bitch. I love diego but this isn't the only game where all he's done is bitch and complain about being touched. Goes against everything I think of him. He is an aggressive beast and there's moments in games where he's a baby. It needs to stop and he needs to start playing his football again like I've seen him play before. 

Fourth: it's great to dream and look at the future and say the kind of things like  ""oh the plan for the next years is baba-cahill-zouma-azpi and then replace Cahill with stones""  but as of now we're only looking at each defender individually and how great they could play those roles but a back four needs years of playing together to develop chemistry, confidence, trust, etc. Terry and Cahill really just started excellently clicking only last season (even with cahill dipping out of form at times) with azpi and ivanovic playing basically the past 3 years with them aswell. IMO, my point explains why filipe luis got such little playing time. Along with my point, think back to when our back 4 had Terry and David Luiz in the middle. Lads. David Luiz. Terry probably had no confidence to play with him and/or no trust in him and it could explain terry's dip in form during those couple seasons/years.

No, absolutely not. But people criticize managers acting like they know what's actually going on. You do not know who the better player is. You don't know more about what a player is actually doing than Mourinho. Managers get it wrong yes, but the get it right more than redditors do. There are plenty of Man U fans that think Michael Carrick is shit. The common fan does not know more than a manager. That's what 90% of the people on here are, common fans. I trust Mourinho's judgement because he's the best manager in the world. My judgement is not as good as his. Neither is yours or anyone else here.

&gt;This argument also falls apart when the manager gets it wrong.

Just because a manager gets it wrong doesn't mean a redditor criticizing the managers actually knows what's right. A broken clock is right twice a day.

&gt;Also, who gives a shit about training?

This shit. This is exactly why I defend managers against message board warriors. Who gives a shit about training? Lol, Sorry but this IS why you don't know anything. Mourinho values what players do in training. That's why he sold De Bruyne. If the best manager in the world values training, maybe it's you who is wrong and not the manager.

Parking in towns and cities can be expensive and a bitch.  We also have a hardon for confusing 1 way systems, so get a Sat-nav.  Use postcodes to navigate.  The UK postal code is way more location specific than the US zip code equivalent which tends to be the same for an entire suburb/town/village.

Fuel prices are currently around 2-2.5x what you're used to.  Not joking, check it.

We drive fast, particularly on motorways.  Things notably chillax in the North of England + all of Scotland, plus Wales and South-West peninsular but close to London, if it's congestion free you often see people doing 90mph+ despite a limit of 70mph.  Only my Dad sticks to 70, but he's 72 years old so...

For getting to/from London/Scotland, book a berth on the Caledonian sleeper.  It's the way forward, but book way the hell in advance (like soon) for cheapest price.

Trains are widely available - figure out an itinerary via http://www.thetrainline.com but it rips you off so use it for timetabling enquiries only then come back and someone will tell you which train company website to use.  Again, the earlier you book the cheaper it is.

Youth hostels are widespread and cheap.  Find one at http://www.hostelworld.com.  I still use them and I'm pushing 40, so you definitely ain't too old.

Also consider becoming a member of English Heritage (google it).

Random itinerary: 

4 days in London, 1 day in Windsor for the town + Castle.

Grab a http://www.firstgreatwestern.co.uk train from Paddington station to Bath to see that for a day + a day trip to nearby Stonehenge (try to get a tour that'll do Avebury too because I personally think it's more interesting but far less visited).

First week toast.

Head from Bath up to Stratford Upon Avon (0.5 days duration) for 1.5 days for Shakespeare.

5 days left. 

From there grab a train to Birmingham International and fly up to Inverness.  Grab a car and route yourself down to Edinburgh over the course of 3 days via Skye and Eilean Donan Castle (Google it, it should be familiar from multiple films).  From Edinburgh either fly or get the Caledonian sleeper back down to London to go home.

null,null,grahampeterclark,null,null,null,"It's a weird one. Mortgage lenders are VERY interested in your monthly income and outgoings (your P&amp;L), and not so bothered about your net worth position.

We recently applied for a residential mortgage and despite having enough assets (cash &amp; S&amp;S ISAs) to buy the house outright, we were rejected on ""affordability grounds"" due to the bank not taking any self-employment, dividend or BTL rental income into account.

Therefore, it's a good idea to work out your monthly income less your monthly expenses as things stand (with the £1200 monthly credit card repayment). Stress test the mortgage repayment at around 8-9% and see if you have a positive monthly net income.

Then, do it again with using your minimum required repayment on the credit card as above.

Finally, do it again without the credit card debt.

This is what the banks will do when they receive your application, so it's good for you to do it upfront.

If you would be accepted for a mortgage without the repayments, but you are to be rejected with the repayments, you then have another question to ask yourself (and the maths is harder for this one)...

If you had the £12k in cash today, and there is a year left in your interest free period, which of the following two scenarios is more financially optimal:

* Pay down the £12k today and buy a new home with a mortgage (benefit being home ownership usually cheaper than renting)

* Leave the £12k invested at x% to earn a net income during the next year, and then look to buy at the end of the year.

I would probably lean towards the latter option, as this will also give you chance to build up a bigger deposit (£10k isn't huge for anywhere in the UK) and to build an emergency fund, etc.",null,0,null,1439795373,null,null,false,0,cu5ny83,null,t3_3h7umd,null,null,null,t3_3h7umd,null,null,null,1441298045,null,2,null,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2,null

Everyone has high hopes on Denayer, but if his development stalls we'll have to go out and find an elite CB next year (if he won't fill out Demichelis boots) and that will be incredibly expensive. Now we have a good chance of getting a young:ish top-10 defender in the world for less than £30m. Most importantly, someone who really really wants to come here apparently. 

Thanks to Txiki focusing on offloading players throughout the years, we're now in a place where we won't have to completely replace players, just upgrade already class players to world class or add depth.

So you're got a potentially subtle effect buried in amongst a mess of statistical noise.

Given the above, any one study is not likely to find an relationship, and such studies are often jumped on by Ash etc as being evidence of the safety of passive smoking. However, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. In any case, there is also evidence that shows a detrimental effect on health:

Trouble is once you get used to fructose your body is on a roller coaster of sugar highs and lows or insulin spikes.

If however you cut it out of your diet ( it takes a couple of weeks of feeling shit to rid your body of it, like any addiction ) your body readjusts and you start to taste food properly again. I did it myself as I'm on a gym diet and I'm a bit of a chocoholic. The difference after a few weeks is fantastic, not only does your body feel a ton better, your mental capacity and general well-being increases too. 

Unfortunately this also includes cutting out alcohol ( one of the big culprits here, )  which for a nation of drinkers is no easy task.

Even though i played I didn't really watch much. No one in my family did so I was never really exposed to it. After scrolling through a bit one day I saw the city logo and thought it was badass. Started playing with them on fifa and casually would watch a game or two. See if they won or lost but nothing major. A few years later I started high school and took German. Our teacher made us each pick a BL team to keep track of their results etc. I was given Wolfsburg. Started watching some of there games as well when I could, which is when I caught the first glimpses of Dzeko(Insta man crush). Fast forward a few years and he was sold to city. I havent missed a Man City game since he joined the club. 

I went and saw them in preseason here in California right before our first tittle winning season in 2011. Ever since seeing Mario try to do that cheeky back heal in that game he has been one of my least favorite players. Another memory from that game that always makes me laugh was the GK warm ups that day. Joe, Pantillimon and some kid come out with the GK coach and jog across the pitch to the opposite end, right in front of where im sitting. As they near the box they all drop the balls on the pitch and Joe immediately eyes one up for a shot on the empty net. He blast it in typical Joe Hart fashion and completely misses the goal, and drills the ONE little cluster of people sitting behind the goal with a laserbeam. He ran over there and checked on them and apologized and took a few photos with them. The Coach and other Gks just are standing on the pitch litterly face palming and shaking there heads.

The guy did do it as part of self bondage. Neither self bondage nor cross dressing are particularly rare fetishes. There almost certainly were secret service officers who entered the flat to sweep for sensitive material upon hearing that someone who worked for GCHQ had died.

Why don't I think that SIS killed him? Because he was only seconded to them. Why would you train someone, trust them enough to second them to another secret service, then when he says he would rather go back to GCHQ (not leave the service, just go back to doing the maths he was originally employed to do) murder him? Then, having murdered him, why would you leave the body in a highly suspicious position, especially when they could have easily gotten rid of the evidence entirely? It doesn't add up. Not to mention, the developed vetting he would have had to go through is a ton of work - it requires giving financial details (incoming, outgoing, savings, assets), multiple interviews of people close to you, researching all your online activity (including notifying them of what porn, gambling, banking, shopping and messaging you look at/do online), checking if you have any other links to any other countries (including messaging via Skype) and much more on top of normal vetting. Why would they then clearly trust the guy, recommend him to another deartment and then kill him in an overly suspect way, not dispose of the body (but still wipe some evidence) and then leave it from there? I'm not saying it's impossible, but it does seems a little far fetched.

Again, I ain't some conspiracy nut. But security services have a long history of killing people in strange ways and in the past it has been to send a message.

Look at Litvinenko, he was killed in a strange way too. Poisoned using an easily traceable and fairly hard to get radioactive substance. It is without a shadow of doubt that someone wanted him killed, they could have stabbed him in hoodies, could have had his car crashed, could have simply shot him in the head.

null,null,Miserygut,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,null,"There's a whole bunch of market signalling tied up in appointing a CEO. Not to mention the asymmetry of bargaining information in privately held companies.

*""You want the best CEO to run your company and you've got to pay for the best.""*

CEOs are in limited supply. There are few good ones. There are fewer good ones in a given company's specific industry. 

If a company is in a position where it's looking externally for a CEO it's obviously aware that there are no internal candidates strong or suitable enough to fill the position. This puts applicants in a strong negotiating position. It would be unusual for a CEO to negotiate themselves out of a job opportunity they were after.

*""Your competitor is paying X, I want X + 10% if I'm going to come here.""*

Strictly talking about publicly held companies, if a competitor's CEO is getting X amount, spending more on a new CEO is a signal to the market that this person is *so valuable* that they're going to make them loads of money. Referring back to my point about limited supply, this means that people on the CEO circuit are able to bounce from organisation to organisation and rapidly pump up their salaries if they all keep jumping. 

It's a very fortuitous set of conditions for a tiny group of people to exploit. Nothing more. It's up to shareholders to hold these people to account and demand lower Executive renumeration. There are other problems with regards to large institutional investors absconding on their shareholder duties which can lead to ineffective executive oversight but that's a whole other topic. 

The solution isn't to introduce exceptionalism into limiting renumeration. CEOs are workers like everyone else. If there are loopholes and tricks they're using to avoid paying tax then those need to be examined and changed if necessary. They're not going to stop asking for more money, ever (nor should any worker). There has to be a discussion about what appropriate levels of tax are for these people and that will vary from person to person.

Compared with its precursor, sucrose, inverted sugar is sweeter and its products tend to retain moisture and are less prone to crystallization. Inverted sugar is therefore valued by bakers, who refer to the syrup as invert syrup. It is similar to high-fructose corn syrup.

Labour have the SNP fucking them in Scotland, which they probably won't get back. They can't make promises to Scotland without upsetting English voters who don't want to see any special treatment of Scotland. And of course Scottish voters DO want special treatment, and the SNP promise to deliver it. So bye bye Scotland basically.

Labour don't even have a leader. And whoever ends up as leader, they're going to be polarising. If it's Corbyn, he doesn't have popular support from most people in the party. Even the MPs who nominated him for the contest are telling people not to vote for him. And if it's someone else, you'll have a lot of emotional Corbyn worshippers who might refuse to vote Labour in revenge. Also there's the small matter of a possible coup against him if he does win.

Without a leader, Labour don't even have a direction. Are they going to be relatively centre left, or hard left? Nobody even fucking knows.

Which leads us to the Tories. Notice how quiet the Conservatives are right now? I am sure that they're sorting out the things you mentioned while all of the media is busy scrutinising Labour. If you don't think they're making all of the EU referendum deals, and arranging deals with Eurosceptic backbenchers etc, you're very naive.

null,null,ZiGraves,null,null,null,"The dysphoria is usually a side-effect of being trans. There are some trans people who don't have so much dysphoria, such that they don't feel a need to get their bodies and hormones modified to match the gender they identify as.

It might help to think of there being two 'types' of trans people:

Type 1 is the sort who has dysphoria - say, a woman who has a penis and a hairy chest. For her, these are such masculine features that everyone treats her as a man and it makes her suffer awfully. She's very unhappy with her body, and people treat her badly because of it, so she wants to change her body so that she can feel and look more like the woman she is and so that people stop mistaking her for a man.

Type 2 is the sort without dysphoria - another woman with a penis and a hairy chest. She gets very annoyed that people keep mistaking her for a man, but she's happy enough with her body and just wants everyone else to be respectful and stop calling her a dude, because it's hardly their business what's in her underwear.

For type 1, surgery or hormones will help, because it will bring her body closer in alignment with how she sees herself and will help other people see her properly as well. For type 2, surgery or hormones might help other people see her properly, but would be very major changes to a body she's okay with and doesn't want to change.

Just for example (and this is a very clumsy example)... say if you lost your hand in an accident. You might want to get a very realistic fake hand, so that it looks just like you never lost your hand and nobody looks at you funny for it, and that way you feel better about yourself. Or you might decide that what's done is done, and get whatever kind of prosthetic is most useful to you - maybe a cool robot claw - even if it means that it's more obvious you don't have a hand like other people do and you have to deal with people being rude sometimes.",null,0,null,1439803177,null,null,false,0,cu5puys,null,t3_3h6uwo,null,null,null,t1_cu5a3jh,null,null,null,1441298944,null,2,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

A rational reason why a CEO's pay would accelerate ahead of the workers: a growing business.  If five years ago they had 100 shops and a £100m profit, but today have 200 shops and a £200m profit, then it makes sense for the CEO's pay to have increased both as reward for the work done, but also because of the increased responsibility of the position.  The majority of workers, however, wouldn't have increased responsibilities, they'll still be serving the same amount of customers, etc., hence different forces apply to their earnings - the salary of Store Manager isn't going to double just because there are more stores.

An irrational (but all too real) reason for a CEO's pay accelerating ahead of workers: a quasi-monopoly, in an industry with little competition sitting on a rising tide (recovering economy) where the lack of competition also disguises their bad decisions.

null,null,Lateralis85,uk,United Kingdom,null,"I'm a 30 year old physicist. I got my undergrad and postgraduate degrees from Warwick between 2003 and 2011. 

After my PhD I went to America on a fixed 2 year contract under the assumption that it looks good on the CV and will help. After that I had a 2 year fixed contract at UCL and recently started a 3 year fixed contract at Cambridge. 

My pay is a little over 30k a year. I've had no job security as you live from project to project. If the PI can't get funding then the project ends and you are redundant. I do have ideas for fellowships, but they are again fixed term, depending on the source of funding and there is absolutely no guarantee of a permanent position or another fellowship afterwards. Moreover, average success rates for fellowships fall in the 10-25% range, as there are too many ideas and not enough money, so there's not even a guarantee of a fellowship. 

So I'm 30, no permanent position and don't know where I'll be in 3 years time, although I'm hopeful I'll still be at Cambridge. But given the very high level of qualification I have attained, the highly technical skills I have acquired, the 8 years of working life and pay I gave up to obtain those skills, and the lack of job security, £30k is not enough. 

In short I do not advise anyone getting a PhD in physics. Get your undergrad then go get a job and earn money. ",null,0,null,1439804042,null,null,false,0,cu5q24k,null,t3_3h6om3,null,null,null,t1_cu4vue0,null,null,null,1441299038,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

The big issue for him is Europe which is fundamental. It's a problem Cameron created when he jumped on the referendum bandwagon in opposition and tried to discard it in 2010. That was the catalyst for the growth of UKIP from a small fringe party to a large insurgent one.

The big issue is how Cameron and his euroskeptic MPs percieve the EU. Cameron wants to stay in. His euroskepticism is not honest, just opportunism for him. Which is why he's basically telling the EU to give me something but whatever you do I'll support to stay in. The Euroskeptics actually do believe truly and honestly that the UK should leave. They are upset and pissed off at how Cameron behaves but the referendum is keeping them quite. If they lose that then Cameron is in trouble. His majority is **razor thin**. His gov is actually weaker than the Coalition gov.

With Labour I think Corbyn will help them. He has done already what the Lib Dems, previous Labour leaders and Cameron have failed to do. Energise the base of their party. Bring back supporters. Look at how Corbyn was recieved in Scotland. Labour never got that last year. 

The only downsides for Labour will be the boundary comission and English votes law. Cameron is trying to rig the system in favour of the Tories. So Labour winning will be very difficult and they will probably be in a coalition gov.

Ordinarily I'd agree with there being insufficient evidence to make such claims, but given the special circumstances surrounding his position I'd say it warrants further thought.

This is a man who was, by all accounts, quite far along the ranks in the intelligence world. He'd worked for MI5/MI6/GCHQ and been seconded to the NSA. Given the stuff we know about espionage (which is still very common!) it is not beyond the realms of possibility that he could have been murdered. It is also not beyond the realms of possibility this could have been achieved by our own Government, or the U.S. government. Just look at how they treated lower ranked employees like Snowden who provided intelligence breaches. What if Williams had threatened something similiar, from a higher role? The possibilities are endless.

I know there is no evidence for that, but it is worth considering because of the nature of intelligence cover-up. Evidence is unlikely to become available so we will never know the truth.

&gt;Most people keep there sex lives very private. 

Ordinarily, yes. But as anyone who has applied for the security services can tell you, the process of getting even an entry-level role involves very intensive vetting -- your entire sex life is examined in detail, your internet records are checked against, your connections in real life are consulted. This process is repeated regularly. **No aspect of your sex life is private if you work in intelligence.**

As a result, you are highly unlikely to get a job with MI5/MI6 if you are involved in such practices unless you are A) very open about it (e.g. family know, which they claim they didn't), or B) you don't engage in those practices.

But to be honest, if you assimilate into our culture and respect our laws then I can put up with what you want to wear, so long as it isn't a burqa. 

I fully reject the idea of women being oppressed and hidden under a bed sheet. Even if they choose to wear them, I disagree with it. I can fully accept people wearing religious things and other clothing as I've said, just respect our laws and assimilate and it is all fine.

The government hasn't done a good job with immigration. We've let too many in and to make it worse, they've done a pretty bad job of assimilating them to British culture. Multiculturalism is not a good long term policy IMO. It does exactly what this OP said, fractures society. Or at least has the potential to in the future.  

I mean I don't want to use this as a fantastic example but it is kind of a realistic scenario. During the fall of the Western Roman Empire, there were ""Barbarians"" inside the empire, in Roman cities. When the empire started going to shit, do you know who people in somewhere like Rome blamed? Yep, they blamed the assimilated barbarians. They killed a lot of them just for being ""barbarians"".

What gets around this for me it turns out, is that my energy levels at that time are pretty much at the lowest they have been all day. Lunch at 12ish has been and gone, everything is started to slope downwards in lieu of dinner at 6ish. I find that if I eat something with high natural sugars (apple, banana) at about 4.45pm then the ride home actually goes much, much better.

Not saying this is your problem - you may just have had a bad day (plenty of us do!) but during my Mod1/Mod2 training I had about 3 bananas a day to combat this. Bananas are high in natural sugars and release them gradually throughout the day, unlike Red Bull or Monster which hits you like a freight train for an hour or two and then plants you on your ass when the comedown hits.

Unsurprisingly, those who joined Labour after Corbyn's bid were the most likely to vote for Corbyn. But those who joined Labour after Miliband but before Corbyn were far more likely to vote for Corbyn than those who joined Labour before Miliband.

Peter principle (People rise to the level of their incompetence) combined with the Dilbert principle (People are pushed up away from doing any meaningful work). The requirements for a good director are different to a good senior management and the difference is not subtle.

&gt;Why would you hire a CEO who has messed up at several companies previously.

You're assuming the appointing committee is competent, which may or may not be the case.

Assuming they are competent, it depends what messing up constitutes. There are quite a few executives which have made large, risky decisions on the future of a company which didn't pan out (Kodak and Marconi are good examples). Did they mismanage anything? Not particularly. Did they completely misjudge the market? Yes they did.

It depends what the company wants the CEO for. A safe pair of hands for 5 years until the CEO-in-waiting is ready to take up the reigns?

So what did the Corporations do? They lobbied the EU so they could get masses of cheap, obedient labour, and here we are. Our workers are now competing against everyone who comes from the EU, and if they don't like the working conditions, then someone else will do the job. Good luck complaining.

As for the labour black market there's been articles and reports appearing about it since shortly after we allowed free movement of people,  it is exasperated by our EU membership.  To be honest I'm amazed no-one else seems aware of this.

They take the responsibility for the performance of the organisation. If their analysis of the future of the market and the company's products don't line up then shareholders lose money and workers lose jobs. Whether or not that is worth the price is up to shareholders.

&gt;Employees are vital to a company too. Devaluing their contribution to the company's success is counterproductive.

Workers are valuable else they wouldn't be paid. There are often situations where responsibility is not adequately renumerated and those individuals leave a company and cause a lot of trouble in doing so. The issue is that companies deliberately keep people in the dark about their value because it keeps wages down. The fundamentals of business are not taught at school for a good reason.

&gt;They do, but that doesn't make it ethical or moral. If senior management are exploiting their workers and not rewarding them fairly, that becomes a problem.

Your morals are not my morals. Hypothetically if I'm hired to set up a slaughterhouse to harvest the tears of bunnies then I'm going to do that in the most effective manner, whatever that is.

Also, this is *Capaldi's Doctor* we're talking about here. He's dark and cold. She could leave, but could you imagine how Capaldi would handle the death of one of the few people he actually cares about? In the finale, I want her to die, and then for Capaldi to straight up kill the monster of the week responsible. New Who has done a great job of giving a sense of sadness and guilt to the Doctor due to the loss of Gallifrey. 

Now that Gallifrey is back, albeit still lost, the Doctor doesn't have that driving force. The Doctor has had some heartbreaking losses, but all of his companions have still lived happy lives. It's time for one to just die, right in front of him. Or better yet, when the Doctor isn't there. He doesn't save her in time. He finds her dying body, or just her corpse, in an empty room, and has to cope with not being the infallible hero he needs to be. If the writers make that leap, the bad guys go a little too far and the Doctor does, too. 

Deep Breath teased at the possibility that the Doctor might go there, but I think they can go just a touch further. It would allow the writers to up the alienating behavior, apathy, and impatience to the character in series 10, too. They tried it with Smith in S7P2 feeling guilty over the full happy lives of the Ponds, but it was stupid to have the warm young guy with an already established personality try that. Capaldi can actually pull off the role of a madman coping with loss. It plays into his character, not destroy it.

If it was auto-erotic doesn't that mean he carried it out on his own so how would people know? I can believe it if he was into bondage or hookers or whatever but something like this could easily be done in private.

As for all the stuff about family and friends being convinced there is something more. I'd take that with a HUGE pinch of salt.

I went through three mandatory work schemes via the jobcentre and despite having a trilingual set of CVs and interview skills which even **employers** said were excellent, still had to sit through stupid, patronising crap like 'don't turn up for an interview in tracksuit bottoms' and 'make sure you spell things on your CV currently'. It actually reached a point where even the advisor admitted defeat and let me go home early because it was apparent to all but the Ustaše at my local JCP that I didn't need to be there. 

  A far better solution would be to improve school careers advice so that school leavers actually leave school having been given the proper help and advice they need. Local employers could be given incentives to work with these careers services and perhaps even take on staff from them. However this would be too much like common sense and certainly for the likes of the Tories. 

Plus I must also add- applying for a job shouldn't be a trek. Having sat through innumerable job applications, I still fail to see why a basic job as a cleaner requires a 13 page application with everything from your inside leg measurement to your ideal holiday location is entirely relevant. Fact is that for an entry-level job, application should be filling out a form, attending an interview and perhaps a test of a skill if needed. Then you find out if you got the job or not.

&gt;Whatever else you can say about cybernats, their targeting and messaging made sense in context – paint Labourites as “red Tories” and the SNP as the only politically viable option for Scotland. Of course, they were also trying to get people to buy into independence, which didn’t work in the end, but let’s put aside victories and defeats for a moment. The point is, the political targetting made genuine sense.

&gt;Looking at Corbyn’s cyber trolls, they tend to attack the same people and messaging as cybernats – people on the centre and right of the Labour Party, or anyone critical of their goals from the centre-left. They spend no time, really, going after Tories – particularly as most Tories are broadly supportive of Jeremy becoming the leader of the Labour Party. So unlike the cybernats, who attacked the SNP’s political enemies, the CCTs are actually attacking their own base – their own party. Perhaps this is just a feature of the leadership contest, you may retort, but I don’t think so. The whole Corbynmania thing has let too much pent up anger out of the bottle. In fact, I think attacks on Labour people and centre-leftists in general who don’t fall into line once Corbyn is installed will probably get worse post-contest.

&gt;Bayer Leverkusen have become the latest club to have interest in Mamadou Sakho turned down.

&gt;Liverpool rejected AS Roma’s proposal of taking the France defender on loan, with a view to a permanent deal, and the German club have been similarly rebuffed.

&gt;Sakho is behind Dejan Lovren and Martin Skrtel in Rodgers’ pecking and the fact two clubs have enquired about his about his status after just one game of the season suggests the centre-back’s first thought is not to fight for his place.

&gt;Rodgers wants a settled defence this term in order to breed continuity and intimated the same back five – Simon Mignolet, Nathaniel Clyne, Skrtel, Lovren and Joe Gomez – who featured against Stoke will start against Bournemouth tonight.

&gt;“There’s certainly a great chance,” said Rodgers. “I think it is key in any team: having players that can play consistently for you, especially in a back five that’s vital.

&gt;“I thought the back four and goalkeeper were excellent last week, their organisation as a group, as a unit.”

&gt;On Lovren, who struggled following his £20m move from Southampton last season, Rodgers added: “I thought he was very, very good last week. I think it’s confidence.

&gt;“I said last year in his second season he’d be a better player here. It’s such a huge move to come here and it’s only when you arrive that you recognise the expectations.

&gt;“It was about trying to find the balance over pre-season. We’ve got excellent players here: Sakho and Kolo (Toure) – excellent defenders.

&gt;“But centre halves will tell you it’s about finding comfort with a partner. I thought the two centre halves were very good last week and Dejan in particular.

&gt;“He was aggressive, he’s good in the air, his reading of the game was good and his passing was simple. I think he’s gained confidence over the pre-season and hopefully that will be maintained.""",null,0,null,1439808539,null,null,false,0,cu5r3gk,null,t3_3hat2a,null,null,null,t3_3hat2a,null,null,null,1441299527,null,9,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,9,null

Alternatively, if you were doing say London to York tomorrow, leaving at 10am (i.e. off peak time), a quick query on the split ticketing website (http://www.splitticketing.com) found a one way ticket fee for £39 by buying a ticket from London to Grantham, another from there to Doncaster and another from there to York.  Buying a standard one way off peak ticket on the day would be £97.80 - a substantial saving.

Entirely possible, but I think it's very unlikely that people get into sexual fantasies like that without at least googling it at some stage. Seems unlikely this wouldn't be flagged at vetting, but you're right, it's plausible for it to be entirely secret. I just doubt whether that was actually the case.

It could also be entirely a fabrication.

&gt;As for all the stuff about family and friends being convinced there is something more. I'd take that with a HUGE pinch of salt. If they don't have any evidence and just have a feeling or think it is out of character then it is highly likely that is due to their grief. Looking for an explanation for a random/self-inflicted death is extremely common for grieving loved ones.

&gt;I actually don't think it is impossible that he was murdered but I'm far less sure than you. I think it might be one of those things that is impossible to know barring whistle-blowing, etc. I agree it needs looking into more but purely due to it's unusual nature and his position in the espionage world. Not due to a) people thinking he didn't partake in any niche fetishes b) family and friends being suspicious without evidence. 

I think there is sufficient suspicion even if you disregard the family. The coroner, with access to far more information than us, came to the following conclusions (from Wiki):

&gt;*The coroner found in a narrative verdict that Williams's death was ""unnatural and likely to have been criminally mediated"". The coroner was ""satisfied that on the balance of probabilities that Gareth was killed unlawfully"". There was insufficient evidence to give a verdict of unlawful killing. The coroner concluded that another party placed the bag containing Williams into the bath, and on the balance of probabilities locked the bag. No fingerprints were found around the bath. The coroner was critical of SIS for failing to report Williams missing for seven days, which caused extra anguish and suffering for his family, and led to the loss of forensic evidence.[2][28][29]*

&gt;*The coroner rejected suicide, interest in bondage or cross-dressing, or ""auto-erotic activity"" being involved in Williams's death.[30] She said his visits to bondage websites only occurred intermittently and were not of a frequency to indicate an active interest.[28] The coroner condemned leaks about cross-dressing[31] as a possible attempt at media manipulation.[2]*

The only people who say it's plausible he accidentally locked himself in the bag are the Police, who bear in mind do have close ties to the security services. I'd be more trusting of the coroner's verdict than the Met Police investigation.

Or control for sugar consumption in multivariate epidemiological models.  Or examine biochemical mechanisms, independent of sugar-mediated toxicity, *in vivo* or *in vitro*.  

If anything, I'm not convinced, at all, that a simple-sugar heavy diet is all that causal when controlling for overweight/obesity.

null,null,orwellsocietyguy,null,null,null,"I'm currently working on a £150 million (set to increase to £400million) campaign that the government (as PHE) is currently putting in place to try and reduce, mostly, the risk of diabetes but also poor health in general. We've done some pretty massive research and the results have surprised many of us.

Some people just don't want to give up smoking. They'll pull out every argument and excuse you could ever make up to justify why they do it. The same goes for eating and drinking too. Some even said ""well I'll just go get a gastric band - everyones doing it"".

The large percentage of people who over eat do so because they simply do not realise they are doing it - they're almost unconscious they're even eating at all sometimes. We went as far as putting cameras on people (with their consent) and watched them snack all day long, but when interviewed were almost entirely unaware of it.

What wasn't surprising was people's understanding of what goes in food is extremely low. When we asked people to talk about their shopping basket and divide them in to healthy and unhealthy they would put things like chips and pizzas in the healthy section. They thought drinking a litre of fruit juice was ok. Ready meals weren't seen as bad. Anything labelled low fat (despite still being high in fat) meant 2 portions. The size of the plates of some people were hilarious the size of the portions not so funny. 

The vast majority knew they were unhealthy and want to change but simply don't know where to start. They're usually 40-60 and working class and unemployed (known as 40-60 CDE) - although the propensity of the unemployed to be overweight was a lot lower. It's about 15 million people (roughly). They all feel that life has pressured them in to their lifestyle and struggle financially. They feel time poor and constantly badgered in to behaviours they feel take away life pleasures. 

Eating, smoking, drinking and watching TV are the only rest / pleasures they get. Many do so as stress relievers.

Preventative medicine is kind of a new thing - it might sound obvious to us but it's not something we've really invested in that much outside smoking campaigns. Whilst the NHS is extremely good at curing you they're pretty poor at preventing you getting it in the first place.

&gt; Must just be coincidence you chose a time-period which for the majority of Labour wasn't as left-wing as Corbyn's current policies. Also it luckily ignores the left-wing government that came before and achieved more than nearly any other British government ever (in terms of improving people's lives) in just 6 years.

If you are forced to say ""well, nearly half a century ago the public liked left-wing politics"" to cite the latest point that they did, then that should tell you a mouthful about the public's appetite for it today.

35 years is a long time in politics. The fact that for 35 *consistent* years a left-wing platform has *consistently* failed to yield positive results in the election with that trend staying true to now tells you just how popular that stance is. Just because the echo-chamber here loves Corbyn and his left-wing stance doesn't mean that the public will.

&gt;Also go and speak to some disabled, long-term ill or elderly people and see what they say about ""measurable results"". They will tell you the results of the Tories can be measured in the loss of autonomy, security and support they are being forced to suffer.

Ignoring the fact that those elderly people vote Tory in huge numbers, none of that changes the fact that the public at large consistently avoid left-wing parties and have done for three and a half decades.

Firstly, he'll look to raise funds directly through certain means. This might include crackdown on massive corporate and individual tax avoidance- [according to PCS the tax gap (between tax which should have been recouped and tax that was recouped) was £119.4billion in 2013/14 tax year](http://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2014/09/22/new-report-the-tax-gap-is-119-4-billion-and-rising/). This might also include a resetting of 50p top tax rate (still lower rate than under Thatcher) to further maximise taxable income. This might include crapping Trident - a long term saving of [over £100billion](http://www.cnduk.org/campaigns/no-to-trident).

Secondly, Corbyn takes a Keynesian approach to economics - as opposed to the pseudo-Hayekian Osbornomics. You spend when the economy is struggling, and balance when the economy is strong. This is the same economic outlook which was considered normal and commonplace prior to 1979 and the launch of Thatcherism. [In 1945 government debt stood at an astonishing 250%](http://www.debtonation.org/2009/10/1945-government-debt-bond-markets-sterling-and-all-that/), and through Keynesian principles of investment not only did the country recover from its economic woes, but we also established the NHS, and nationalised a variety of different industries. 

However, the economy really should have improved by the time 2020 comes round; it shouldn't take 12 years to return to stable economic levels after a crisis.

Personally, I'd rather lose out on a bit of cash than lose out on a no claims discount and have to declare my claim every year. 

For example, say a bike is worth £2k. Say the excess is £500. If it gets stolen, I get paid. If it bursts into flames, I get paid. If someone crashes into me, I get paid. It's only if I cause a complete write-off that there's a difference. 

Say you're fuly comp. At that point, insurance company might offer you £1500. Your excess is £500, you're out of pocket by £1k and for the next five years you're declaring that accident on every policy you take out or renew, and you have no NCD anymore. I'd guess that over that 5 years you'll pay far more than £1k in extra premiums. 

Say you were TPFT and remember we're only talking about an accident where you were at fault - at that point you're out of pocket by the £1k, but still have an NCD. Unless it's a bad accident and the police are involved, you can just accept the loss and not file it as a claim with your insurance company. You still have any NCD, you don't have to tick the dreaded box which says you've made a claim in the past five years. 

If you could personally afford the loss, I don't see any harm in going third party. It's just a numbers game - after a couple of years of riding the difference gets smaller and smaller, so you might as well pay the £30 difference and go to fully comp. However when you're talking £500+ difference, personally I'd save the money and have it in the bank in case I ever had an accident. 

However if the bike is worth more and you know you'd be screwed if you wrote it off, go the other way.

null,null,strifeblood,null,null,null,"Fair points, and I probably should have clarified a bit more.

Schurrle hasn't returned to his old form, but he was ill for a long time last year and it looks like it affected him for the remainder of the year. Despite that, I watched a lot of Wolfsburg games last year after he got transferred  and while he's not good as he was in 2013-14, he still looked much better than he did for us. He may not have set the Bundesliga on fire, but he looked much more confident and was making less mistakes. When he was with us, he looked like he was trying way too hard to prove himself to Jose by taking more shots and not passing instead of playing his normal game. 

Same applies to Salah last year. I'm not even a fan of Salah or rate him highly, I'm just using him as an example of why I feel we need to rotate a lot more. Same thing also happened to Cuadrado last season. I think a big reason for our drop off in the last half of the season was the progressive fatigue. 

I honestly feel Zouma outplayed Cahill and there was no reason he should have been dropped in some big PL games last season. Cahill did have a good finish to the season, I'll give you that. However, if somebody like Zouma, who's a backup, comes in and outperforms the starter. Shouldn't they get the same benefits the starter does? I really don't know why Cahill was preferred. Zouma was playing out of his skin. Instead, he eventually got benched and was left to the occasional game as a holding mid. 

As for Ivanovic, my issue isn't this year. It make sense to start him these last two games with no viable replacements. It was just last year when he had a stretch of 3 of 4 games where he was leaking goals and making mistakes and didn't remotely looked like he going to get benched. I really wanted to see Luis at LB and Dave at RB. People might say Luis didn't do well, but does anybody not notice the pattern? All our bench players outside of Remy and Zouma were shit because they only got 10 minutes here and there or a start in a cup game every few weeks. 

My biggest issue is people saying we have awful depth. I don't think it's bad. I just think we never rotate enough so bench players are never really in form. Very few can play limited minutes every few weeks and be great. Players need playing time.

What? Every member of NATO has allies outside of Europe, and that's most of Western Europe:

&gt; The EU is dangerous to our nation, look at this notice how UK is the only country in europe that has universities that are in the top ten in the world? its because we dont degrade our quality of education by giving everyone free courses like the other EU countries

Your leaping to causation here suggests otherwise. 

&gt; Our nation has contributed more to the world from the 1800's to 1945 then all other european nations in their history combined

This is getting more ridiculous. Got a source?

&gt; I say this because i find it funny how mainland europeans call us loud and obnoxious fat and ugly but then go to claim how europe is so much superior because europe has the university of oxford and europe created the jet engine

What I'm getting at is that there's a mainstream media narrative taking hold that people get type II diabetes because they're fat when there's no evidence that it's the primary causal factor and only one proposed mechanism AFAIK. The figures I've seen are that 80% of type II diabetics are overweight or obese. Not only does that leave 20% without the supposed cause but there's the fact that 75% of the general population over-40 (when type II typically is diagnosed) are in the same category.

I wouldn't argue that being overweight doesn't make symptoms worse or that losing weight isn't a sensible health precaution without a diagnosis and a reasonable course of action with a diagnosis.

For example it should be straight up illegal to advertise unhealthy foods on TV. If people want them, they can seek them out unaided in the shops. Advertising unhealthy foods to **kids**? Are you kidding me? How the fuck is that legal?!

Then we come to shops... in pretty much every single convenience store in the entire UK you'll find stacks upon stacks of sweets at the till. This should again be illegal. Keep them to a specific part of the shop, similar to alcohol. And keep it legally a set distance from the tills.

And one of the worst examples for me is how we strategically target children, much we like we used to with cartoon adverts for cigarettes. I recently went to see Inside Out and it featured 7 advertisements for extremely sugary cereals. All advertised all nicey nicey for the kids with characters they love, emphasising the chocolate and sugary contents. It's absolutely disgusting we allow this, how is even a good parent supposed to combat that sort of bombardment? A bad one has absolutely zero chance.

It's absolutely insane how we don't throw people even the tiniest of bones. If you're trying to lose weight and struggling, you're going to come into contact with those sugary treats just as part of a normal healthy day even if you go out of your way to avoid it. And children are going to be advertised to and encouraged to eat unhealthily regardless of how good the parents are or what sort of preventative action they take.

You cannot visit a single shop or go about your day without shopping online and still avoid the sorts of food which will make you fat. Even online you'll get ""you added this last time, did you forget?"" and you're one click away from ordering that multi-pack of Mars bars.

Maybe my stance is too authoritarian but I'm not trying to take that food away from people. I eat it myself and remain a healthy weight... but it shouldn't be shoved in my face 24/7 in every format. I strongly advocate peoples choices and I am extremely passionately against prohibition of these foods (or drugs) but limiting their exposure, advertising and access is absolutely critical and fundamental to safe consumption and harm reduction. 

We let them get away with murder. I mean honestly stopping them from advertising to children is just the most basic fundamental step that should be taken... we'd flip our shit if they advertised alcohol to kids but that's probably safer than letting them drink a large Coke from McDonalds in one sitting (which for the record is around 120% of their daily sugar in one single drink, forget any food they have).

Not sure if this is the answer you want to hear, but the justification is that their salary is what the board of directors thinks they are worth.

Being a CEO is a high stakes game.  It's not like you can just go door to door asking companies if they need a CEO.  You need to have a very particular set of skills and the connections to get your foot in the door.  Being a CEO is like being a movie star.  There can be long stretches where you don't have a job.

The thing that keeps governments moderate is fear of losing elections to the other side. Once they lose that fear, they simply do whatever they please.

If he was facing the anti-war Ken Clarke, who was much more electable, he'd have thought twice.

I don't think Corbyn wants to cosy up to Russia or abandon support for former communist countries. I think he just seems to want to give the same consideration to people in other countries that he gives to us. He reverses situations in his mind to see if they're fair.  If Wiltshire was randomly bombed from 10,000 feet by drones sent from saudi arabia to keep us Islamic because Saudi invaded us in the 19th century and made northern France and southern England  a state called Al Jannah (the garden)  even though we all have very different identities, I think we'd be angry too.

&gt; No one outside of europe would defend germany if NATO didint exist

Is that important? Anybody capable of threatening the UK or Germany would only be deterred by NATO members anyway.

France and Germany have so few international alliances because of the specifics of their history; the notion of a treaty organisation that binds many countries together into one group outside of a warmaking coalition is a relatively modern one and quite an objective improvement over the old idea of each country forming individual alliances with tens of other countries; if you're a modern country or a modern incarnation of one (as France and Germany are) you'd expect to be part of a multi-member bloc. It's not problematic that most of Germany's and most of France's alliances are through NATO, it's beneficial.

First of, would be too much to ask to let Remy/Falcao/Cuardrado/Moses have a shout in the next game in the starting 11? 
They seem to be hungry to prove themselves. Tbh to me Hazard and Costa have looked like shells of themselves against Swansea and City and maybe dropping them would burn a fire in their belly. (Reminds me of the time Mou benched Benzema in his stint at Real Madrid and it worked wonders) 

Willian has no end product, no matter how much the kid works his ass off for us. He needs to get better at his delivery, I mean he's a winger and threads balls in like Ivanovic - straight to the defenders feet.  

Everyone has opinions on the pivot with Fabregas and Matic and our lack of options are abysmal; the always horrible Ramires and the game killer Jon Obi wan. I personally see no solution to this besides a signing a new player or bring in RLC into the mix.

Lastly, Branislav.. Shift Azi to the right and play Baba to the left I guess is our only chance right now. If we had Felipe Luis it might have been different.

Certainly not all TIID individuals are obese or overweight - this is because individuals require a defect in insulin signalling and insulin production to develop TIID, which is often exacerbated (or exposed) by the extra metabolic stress of obesity or overweight.  Some TIIDs develop TIID at a low BMI because their defects are extremely pronounced (or ""penetrant"").  Others (the majority) require a lot of metabolic stress before their systems give up.  Either way, without these defects, you won't develop TIID.

While there is a bit of evidence that sugar consumption, independent of bodyweight, increases TIID risk, it's small fry compared to the increased risk induced by massive weight gain, by any calories.

From the ADA:

&gt;Being overweight does increase your risk for developing type 2 diabetes, and a diet high in calories from any source contributes to weight gain. Research has shown that drinking sugary drinks is linked to type 2 diabetes. - See more at: http://www.diabetes.org/diabetes-basics/myths/#sthash.a84HIM2i.dpuf",null,0,null,1439813558,null,null,false,0,cu5shqn,null,t3_3hafuo,null,null,null,t1_cu5s0a4,null,null,null,1441300238,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

null,null,wongie,eng-hertfordshire,Hertfordshire,null,"&gt;I cringe at the thought of people considering me to be ""european""

I cringe at those who think Britain's identity is completely self-contained which is absolutely false, what make Britain, what makes any national identity is intrinsically tied to its surrounding neighbours. What helped British identity grow over the centuries is precisely how we differentiate ourselves from the mainlanders, our fates are tied as it were.

&gt;We are nothing like the europeans

In much the same respect Germans are nothing like the French. They've managed to overcome all their differences.

&gt;We have had the same stable government since the creation of great Britain
&gt;We have kept out monarchy throughout all these years

I don't see how these are major factors in whether we define ourselves as European, but don't forget the British monarchy that has been such a stable feature of the British political landscape are German, and San Marino is recognised as having the single longest continuous stable government.

&gt;I dont see the UK to be ""allies"" with the european countries we are just business partners

And why is that? Do you know the oldest ever continuous alliance which is still in effect is between the British and the Portuguese, we've been allies for well over half a millennium, and after all these centuries you'd still want to see them as simply business partners?

&gt;They NEED each other we dont need them

Actually, they don't need each other, they can simply get along without union, we don't need them either. I think this is more a point against the European Union, not just being European identity. In that regards no country in Europe needs to be in the EU, but that's different to the principle of shared community which is a desire not a need.

Besides I think Britain needs Europe more than the other way around at least their beaches, there'd be revolutions if all the retired people in the south of Spain and France no longer had any sun left to bask in.

&gt;The EU is dangerous to our nation, look at this notice how UK is the only country in europe that has universities that are in the top ten in the world? its because we dont degrade our quality of education by giving everyone free courses like the other EU countries

If you mean danger to mean specifically your example of education, [just take a look at this](http://public.media.smithsonianmag.com/legacy_blog/06_21_2013_periodic-table.jpg) Britain tops the list with 23 periodic table discoveries, Sweden and Germany are a close 4 behind, not bad for relatively small countries who did not have the benefit of the largest empire on Earth. And I'm not sure how versed you are in science but you severely underestimate Europe contribution to science. Not only science but literature and the arts.

If you take danger to UK in military affairs well be aware that the UK has interfered in European affairs far more than the other way around. British foreign policy on Europe for much for the 19th century was to maintain a balance of power meaning a constant meddling to ensure no one country dominated.

&gt;Our nation has contributed more to the world from the 1800's to 1945 then all other european nations in their history combined.

That is actually very debatable, and I disagree UK has contributed more in absolute terms, though I concede it has made more notable contributions. I don't think you fully realise how many fields there are in science, engineering, literature, the arts etc there are. Europe is a massive place and if the EU existed from 1800 to 1945 they would have dwarfed the British Empire at its height in any field. Going back to the preiodic field, if you tally up all EU-only countries then they'd have 64 than the UK, short of almost 3 times as much, and with 339 nobel prize laureates compared to UK's 123.

&gt;The only note worthy thing mainlanders have created was the automobile which was made in Germany... i find it funny how mainland europeans... go to claim how europe is so much superior because europe has the university of oxford and europe created the jet engine

Makes me think you've been trolling all along, or the most uneducated philistine.

They're our stronger allies, certainly. How you define 'true' probably depends on what you think the value in them is. We probably cooperate more closely on a higher level (procurement, organisation) with Germany than we do with any of those three. [British Forces Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Forces_Germany) still barely exists, for example.

Going back to your thing about protection, though, are Canada or Australia able to project enough power to be a credible sort of protection-ally for the UK? Most of our alliances are for convenience as much as mutual protection.

&gt; Saying Germany and the UK are allies is like saying US and China are allies

We seem to have found ourselves on military operations with the Germans a few times over the past couple of decades. That's not true of the US and China.

null,null,a-curious-monkey,lfc87,,null,"If you're talking about the Ashley Cole on the pitch of Arsenal and the early Chelsea years. On the pitch, then yes he was a force and easily one of the best defensive and marauding left backs of the 2000's. But that's just on the pitch. He still has to train with the team sometime.

Since Probably Mourinho first left Chelsea though, I wouldn't put him in ahead of Flanagan, Enrique or Gomez. Maybe Moreno against a bigger team with a quick right winger but that's it. He's not quick enough, doesn't cross the halfway line anymore because he knows he can't cover back if he does and has no desire to tire himself out at his age. Fullbacks in especially our system have to have the biggest engines of almost any position on the pitch for it to work. Johnsons engine failed him and everybody saw how much of an impact that had on our game every time he started since about 2012...

If you're talking about as a model pro to help the youngsters. Not a chance. He's a vile person. He was efficient and kept himself personally at a high level of fitness but Milner is far more professional and doesn't go round shooting YTS kids with air rifles or bringing smoke grenades to Melwood. Even in a team of utter cunts he stood out as being the 2nd most hateful human only bettered by John Terry who to me is possibly the worst kind of sociopath to ever play the game professinally. The press would have a field day with him too, he'd be a constant story as they tried to make dirt happen and his influence over kids would be disruptive. He'd still believe he should be first choice and would upset the development of players like Gomez. He'd also probably still want relatively huge wages to assure his place in the hierarchy above those people he considers beneath him. Namely the entire human race. I wouldn't want his influence on any group of young players and you can see Rodgers is of the same opinion with the bad boy group he's already segregated at Melwood.  

I don't mind winners having ruthless streaks and determination but there's no place for players who aren't dominating their sport or position because of that determination or ruthlessness. Suarez,  Tevez, even Jimmy Milner is about as personally ruthless as I can imagine a pro. People make exceptions for those and make adjustments accordingly. Those that are just negative, ruthless and narcissists but don't actually produce the goods to back it up are just bad human beings who'll ruin team harmony and give the younger guys false idols.",null,0,null,1439815233,null,null,false,0,cu5t2no,null,t3_3h2nkw,null,null,null,t3_3h2nkw,null,null,null,1441300512,null,1,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

Mr Cameron’s speech will immediately follow the publication of new statistics which are expected to show a continuation of the stubbornly high levels of immigration to the UK. The figure rose to just under 300,000 by the end of the coalition’s term in office. Undaunted, the Tories have repeated their intention to cut the numbers, although the tens of thousands target has been rebranded as an “ambition”.

So there's a problem that has arisen, mainly due to our EU membership.



Link 2: During the BBC London investigation, two Romanian researchers joined labourers gathering at locations in Tottenham and Cricklewood each morning looking for work.

They were told by the workers that builders frequently promised to pay them a fair wage - only to refuse to pay them the full sum at the end of the day. One labourer in Tottenham claimed he had once been paid £10 for almost a full day's work.

Evidence of the black market, that you seemed to not realise existed earlier, or at least that it was such a problem.

'A migration thinktank has warned that a 'black market' in labour and the crisis in the Middle East are among factors increasing pressure of Britain's borders.

It comes as official figures show a dramatic increase in the number of illegal immigrants, or 'clandestines' being caught trying to sneak into the UK.'

Honestly I probably know more about US politics than I do about British and there is zero chance Trump wins. I know r/uk loves to believe the US is  a neo con establishment but this isn't the case. It is actually to the left of the UK on a number of issues.

Furthermore in national elections it is very difficult for Republicans to win. In mid terms they have a much better chance because the Republicans are more likely to turn out but on a national level the Democrats turn up and it's basically a lock for them.

Corbyn has more of a chance of winning in the UK than Trump does in the US. Also the wheels are coming off his campaign I'd be surprised if he even gets the republican nomination.

For now though, even though you seem to quite willingly ignore hard empirical evidence, let's follow the timeline of events:

**New Company – Same Club**

1. Rangers PLC went into administration
2. Creditors reject CVA at 8.5p in the £
3. Sevco Scotlland bought the assets of Rangers PLC for 5.5p in £ and transfer them to a newco
4. SFA agreed Rangers transfer of membership from oldco to newco
5. Rangers accept transfer embargo and honour football debts while other creditors not paid in full
6. Rangers were demoted to SFL 3
7. As a result of going newco UEFA banned the club for 3 seasons for failure to file unbroken accounts and a change to the clubs legal form and/or corporate structure.

*Timeline of Administration, Sale of club and assets and ongoing Liquidation of oldco PLC.*

14th February 2012 - Administration of oldco begins February 2012 with Duff and Phelps.
12th June 2012 - CVA is rejected and Rangers FC (club) is sold out of Administration as an asset of Oldco to a Newco called Sevco Scotland. Company owns club and can now legally change its name to trade on behalf of Rangers Football Club.
31st October 2012 – Oldco is passed onto liquidators BDO.

Notice the timeline. The club were moved **out** of the holding PLC prior to the PLC being placed in liquidation. At no point did Rangers Football Club cease to be.

[UEFA coefficient points](http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/uefarankings/club/)

261		Rangers FC	SCO	2.050	0.860	0.650	0.800	0.400	4.760

""Assessment
THIS ADJUDICATION REPLACES THAT PUBLISHED ON 12 JUNE 2013. THE WORDING HAS CHANGED BUT THE DECISION TO NOT UPHOLD THE COMPLAINT REMAINS.

Not upheld

Whilst the ASA acknowledged that Newco had not taken on all of the debts and liabilities of Oldco when it purchased its assets and that that would normally preclude a business from trading on the reputation of a liquidated predecessor company, we noted, having read its report in full, that both an Independent Commission appointed by the SPL and the ECA had reached the conclusion that the football club RFC was a recognisable entity in its own right, and that it had continued in existence despite being transferred to another owner and operator. We consulted with UEFA, which explained that its rules allowed for the recognition of the “sporting continuity” of a club’s match record, even if that club’s corporate structure had changed. We also consulted with the SFA, which confirmed that its definition of a football “club” varied depending on context, and could sometimes refer to an entity separate from the club’s corporate owner. The SFA further pointed out that, following RFC’s transfer to a new corporate owner, Newco did not take a new membership of the Scottish FA but rather that the previous membership was transferred across to them so they could continue as the same member of the Scottish FA. We considered that consumers would understand that the claim in question related to the football club rather than to its owner and operator and we therefore concluded that it was not misleading for the ad to make reference to RFC's history, which was separate to that of Newco.

We investigated the ads under BCAP Code rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising) and 3.9 (Substantiation) and CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising) and 3.7 (Substantiation) but did not find them in breach.""

[ECA recognises Rangers' history](http://sport.stv.tv/football/clubs/rangers/205975-european-clubs-body-downgrades-rangers-status-but-recognises-history/)

""Taking into account that the 'new entity' also acquired the goodwill of the 'old entity', it was held by the ECA executive board that the goodwill, taking into account legal and practical arguments, also included the history of the 'old company'.

""Consequently it was concluded that Rangers FC was entitled to associated membership of ECA as considered to be a founding member.""

“Alike at Scottish FA level, this ‘new entity’ had to re-apply for membership with ECA as according to Swiss law, membership of an association is neither heritable nor transferable (article 70.3 of the Swiss Civil Code).

“According to the prerequisites set out in the membership policy, Rangers FC did not meet the requirements to be granted ordinary membership (top division and European licence).

[Duff &amp; Phelps](http://local.stv.tv/glasgow/197765-rangers-oldco-in-liquidation-after-administrator-legal-dispute/)

“As administrators, our primary function was to keep the business going and effect a sale of the Club in order that it could continue, while maximizing the return for the creditors. These objectives were achieved. It will now fall to the liquidators to realise any further potential funds that may go to creditors. We have worked closely with the liquidators over the last few months to ensure an orderly transition.”

[Duff &amp; Phelps ii]( http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18413384 - video 2 mins 30s in)

How can Rangers be considered for membership when they can't provide four years’ financial statements?

""Sevco Scotland Ltd bought Rangers Football Club PLC’s share in the SPL and membership of the Scottish FA as part of their acquisition of assets. Under Article 14.1, Sevco Scotland are requesting the transfer of the existing membership of Oldco. This is different to an application for a new membership, which generally requires four years of financial statements. ""

[SFA ii](http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/scottish_fa_news.cfm?page=1961&amp;newsCategoryID=3&amp;newsID=10252)

“We have reached agreement on all terms and conditions attached to the transfer of membership and are able to grant conditional membership, ahead of the formal transfer of the SPL share a week today. This will allow the season to kick-off as planned this weekend and I am sure there will be many who will join me in welcoming the start of the new football season in Scotland.""

“Rangers is a fantastic club with a great history,” he said. “With the support that they have, they will come back.

“They will, in not too long a time, be back in the SPL. I have no doubt about that.

“They’re needed for Scottish football because of their following and the size of the club and especially their history.”

[Lord Nimmo Smith](http://sport.stv.tv/football/clubs/rangers/215802-key-points-from-lord-nimmo-smiths-ruling-on-rangers/)

Lord Nimmo Smith refers to newco and oldco throughout his lengthy report on the first stage of the hearing and also states that: ""Newco is not and never has been a member of the SPL.""

But he adds: ""In legal terms, it (a club) appears to us to be no different from any other undertaking which is capable of being carried on, bought and sold.""

Lord Nimmo Smith ii – SPL Dual Contract Tribunal 28th February 2013

It will be recalled that in Article 2 ""Club"" is defined in terms of ""the undertaking of an association football club"", and in Rule I1 it is defined in terms of an association football club which is, for the time being, eligible to participate in the League, and includes the owner and operator of such Club. Taking these definitions together, the SPL and its members have provided, by contract, that a Club is an undertaking which is capable of being owned and operated. While it no doubt depends on individual circumstances what exactly is comprised in the undertaking of any particular Club, it would at the least comprise its name, the contracts with its players, its manager and other staff, and its ground, even though these may change from time to time. In common speech a Club is treated as a recognisable entity which is capable of being owned and operated, and which continues in existence despite its transfer to another owner and operator. In legal terms, it appears to us to be no different from any other undertaking which is capable of being carried on, bought and sold. This is not to say that a Club has legal personality, separate from and additional to the legal personality of its owner and operator. We are satisfied that it does not, and Mr McKenzie did not seek to argue otherwise.

“It is the club, not the owner, who plays in the league,” he said. “The rules clearly contemplate sanctions upon a club, in distinction to upon the owner or operator. That power must continue to apply, even if the owner at the time of [any] breach of rules has ceased to be a member of the SPL and its undertaking has passed to another owner or operator.”

[Lord Glennie](http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/opinion...CSOH%2095.html)

[1] This is a petition for judicial review by the Rangers Football Club plc, a company presently in administration. That company presently operates Rangers Football Club (to whom I shall refer as ""Rangers""). Rangers are members of the Scottish Football Association (""the SFA""), and are bound by the Articles of the SFA and by the Judicial Panel Protocol which sets out the disciplinary rules relating to the conduct of members of the SFA and the conduct of disciplinary proceedings to enforce such rules

Club founded in 1872. It became part of a company ie. Incorporated in 1899 and its corporate identity was Rangers Football Club PLC. Until then Rangers and most other clubs were simply clubs and did not have to take on a legal form. The company did not have 140 years of history in any case (2012-1899 = 113 years) – the club did.

[BDO Liquidators – HMRC appointed](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18426943)

""It's important to understand that the appointment of liquidators will not mean the end of football at Ibrox - only the end of the company that ran the club,""

HMRC – “the liquidation route does not prejudice the proposed sale of the club. This sale can take place either through a CVA or a liquidation.”

SFL - ""To everyone involved in the club and its remarkable and loyal fans Happy 140 years Anniversary.”

SPL- “it is an existing club, even if it is a new company”

SFA Statement/Tom English paraphrasing - 

“Last August, Michele Centenaro of the ECA contacted the SFA and asked for an appraisal of the Rangers situation and whether they could be deemed the same Rangers as before or a new company unworthy of acknowledgment from the ECA. The SFA’s response was unambiguous. Different corporate entity but same Rangers, same history, same honours accrued over 140 years.""

One more thing, because I see a lot of people giving advice on the type of engine. I would advise you to get a 1.4 - 1.6 diesel on a medium-to-small car. Things like Kia Rio or Ford Fiesta have excellent diesel engines and can go for very low prices. Going higher in size are models like the Cee'd, the Focus, the Hyunday i30. 

Diesel is very good in UK because the traffic is quite mild on motorways and particularly on country roads (if you use any), so you'll be using the best rev range on a diesel. The difference in fuel consumption is quite large - I went from a 36mpg 1.6 i30 petrol to a 52mpg 2.2 Civic diesel. The diesel had twice the pulling power as well! A 1.6 engine will probably set you somewhere around 55-60mpg. Keep in mind that for a cheaper, used car the difference in getting a diesel versus a petrol engine is not that high anymore (probably &lt;£300), so it's not like you're having to drive for 30k miles/year in order to 'make up' for said difference. Just make sure the car has been serviced and - very importantly - hasn't been written off by the insurance companies.

While diesel has recently went below the petrol price again, the price for both can also vary a lot depending on the area and company - could be 1.2 here and 1.07 at a station 5 miles away - search for the best deal in your area and top up there. In my area, the best prices will usually be at a Gulf.

I would personally steer away from automatics, because most of them are prone to defects and consumption is generally higher. Also, I find them quite dangerous on motorways, as it makes the driver relax excessively and encourages sleepiness.

That’s a massive generalisation that’s impossible to justify. Also, a lot of people in the UK would consider themselves to be one of “the Europeans”.

I want the UK to become a republic. Does that mean I’d be better voting to stay in the EU?

&gt; They NEED each other we dont need them

Hardly.

&gt; UK is the only country in europe that has universities that are in the top ten in the world? its because we dont degrade our quality of education by giving everyone free courses like the other EU countries

I don’t see it as “degrading” courses. 

Tuition fee increases in England are one of the most cited reasons for the LibDems effectively collapsing at the last election. Also, in Scotland, the SNP promised not to bring in tuition fees and it currently holds a huge percentage of the votes. Both of these examples suggest that most people don’t agree with you.

&gt; Our nation has contributed more to the world from the 1800's to 1945 then all other european nations in their history combined

Who does this? When?

For us, you have to look through how FFP works. It's not all about fees and revenue, you have to look at amortization which is very important for FFP. Txiki has worked hard getting players on extended contracts, which basically means they're ""cheaper"" according to FFP. You divide the transfer fee and salary over the amount of years a player has been, and will be contracted to the club. We have a lot of players who has been here for many years. 

It also helps that we barely spent money last year and made (probably) a big profit, and that we're no longer paying players who has left our club (we paid Adebayor for years after he left, for example). Then you have the new TV deal.

We've also sold several players, and if we have a net spend of £100m this year, we're just back to the level we were when we spent £100m two years ago on Navas, Jovetic, Negredo and Fernandinho. And our revenue is much higher now while our total salary is lower.

Hey, I was just joking too.  Just like you were.  So, you can dish it out, but can't take it.  That's pathetic in of itself.  That you now whine about it really shows just how overly pathetic you are.  Maybe someone should call you an ambulance to take a look at that sore bottom.

You really need to look up the word hypocrite.

&gt;To explain again. As he didn't give any indication as to what he thought about the woman, your blind guesses on what he might think about it are it irrelevant (not the woman her self. I would have thought this was quite obvious)

This entire discussion is about the food thief.  The comment he replied to was **directly about the difference between her punishment and this banker**.  That was the **point** of the banker.  Taking it as a completely separate topic is a massive distortion of this entire discussion, let alone, in your idiotic words ""completely irrelevant"".  If there was any attempt at derailing it is by you and him.  My point is valid and should merit a response, which is the point of discussion.

&gt;But then it is quite clear that you had no idea what he though so the intention of making something up like that, whether it was preceded by ""I'm guessing"" or not is simply to slander him as someone who hates poor people or something.

Right, of course.  No one can ever discuss anything unless they magically know exactly what the other person thinks and how they'll respond to every single thing.

The intent was to direct this all back to the relevant distinction.  One which he seemed to ignore completely.  That you now insist I'm the one being irrelevant shows just how retarded you are.

&gt;You have no idea whether this is the case but you said to to muddy the waters anyway. The only reason you said ""I'm guessing"" is so you could also weasel out of it if someone pulled you up on it. Which is exactly what you are doing now.

You are desperately clutching at straws.  You are opposed to language now.  Am I to add drawn out disclaimers everywhere so retards like you don't get confused every 5 seconds by basic English?

This is not to say that there may not be some people who have gender dysphoria and don't consider themselves trans for reasons of their own, but they would be such a small number of an already relatively small population that I'm not aware of any studies or resources on the subject.

However, you can have gender dysphoria and not *want* to be trans, just like in the hand example you'd probably wish you'd never lost your hand to begin with. So someone who is a woman with a penis and hairy chest might wish that either she could feel comfortable as a man so as not have encountered the problems of dysphoria to start with, or she might wish that her body had breasts and no penis so that people saw her as a woman.

Good one.

&gt;Hey, I was just joking too. Just like you were. So, you can dish it out, but can't take it. That's pathetic in of itself. That you now whine about it really shows just how overly pathetic you are. Maybe someone should call you an ambulance to take a look at that sore bottom.

Seriously though. Don't take this so personally. I'm just some guy disagreeing with you on the internet. 

&gt;This entire discussion is about the food thief. The comment he replied to was directly about the difference between her punishment and this banker. That was the point of the banker. Taking it as a completely separate topic is a massive distortion of this entire discussion, let alone, in your idiotic words ""completely irrelevant"". If there was any attempt at derailing it is by you and him.

Just because someone said that the punishment the banker received was proportionate doesn't at all mean that they thought that what the woman received was correct. Just because a comparison is being made doesn't mean that any support of the banker means that there is no support for the woman either. But thank you. I now understand why you were saying this. It was a misunderstanding on your part rather than an attempt to derail the discussion.

&gt;The intent was to direct this all back to the relevant distinction. One which he seemed to ignore completely. That you now insist I'm the one being irrelevant shows just how retarded you are.

I never said the woman, or discussion of her is irrelevant. I was saying that your assumptions are irrelevant as they are not based on facts. I stated this quite clearly before. But like I said, I now understand it's not because you are trying to put peoples words in peoples mouths but you are simply misunderstanding what people are saying.

&gt;You are desperately clutching at straws. You are opposed to language now. Am I to add drawn out disclaimers everywhere so retards like you don't get confused every 5 seconds by basic English? Idiots like you are why we have obvious warnings everywhere like ""warning: hot coffee is hot and can hurt you"".

- Bread
- Potatoes
- Rice
- Noodles
- Sugary drinks
- Deserts that aren't fruit
- Sweets/chocolate
- Anything else high in sugar/carbs

I started eating more salad and vegetables, and continued eating meat (mostly white and fish). Every day I would run a calorie deficit with the exception of the weekly cheat day, where I could eat a bit unhealthier if I wanted. I made no other changes, I have a sedentary lifestyle and job. I weighed myself this morning the 6th Monday from my first weighing, and I've lost 12.2 pounds, literally from just doing that.

Despite the whole ""doing drugs is evil"" negative slant at the time, these were long-term heroin users who simply never stopped because they enjoyed it. They adapted to life, had spouses, children, were promoted and were successful at work. And also really dug Horse. 

It has made me wonder for a long time since reading that - how many others are there out there, who use banned substances - addictive or non-addictive - who also live productive, reasonable, decent, happy and fulfilled lives? They won't make the headlines, people who aren't in their spheres will never know about their addictions, simply because they are not substance abusers, but merely substance users.

Lots of very nice bikes I see have piss poor security. Not so much as a disc lock in sight, and these bikes are clearly worth 3-4 times what my CBF is! It astounds me but some common sense and effort can go a long way.

* Keep the bike hidden from public view, but clearly seen in private view. You want to be able to see the bike or you want other neighbours to see it, but not display it to the world (no matter how shiny it is). Out of sight, often out of mind.
* Invest in a brand name disc lock and don't throw away the lock reminder coil (the bit that goes onto your handlebars). From a distance, this alone can deter a yob - he might go down the road where he saw that GSXR on someones driveway instead.
* Heavy chain, ground anchor yadda yadda - this is a given if you own a home and take bike security seriously. If you don't own a home a big cinderblock or some sort of heavy anchor that a chain can be looped around (use your loaf - there's loads that can be used for this) but doesn't damage any patio is a good alternative.
* Be vigiliant. If you hide your bike, lock it up then the only way someone might know about it is if you are spotted riding it. Yobs are less likely to pay attention really but still - if some knob in a rollerskate is following you for over 60% of your journey then do some right turn/right turn/right turn trickery away from your bike storage location to see if you can shake him. Keep an eye out for little darlings hanging around close to your bike premises.
* Bike cover - even a cheapo one. There's only so much that you can learn by looking at a pair of Michelin Pilot Streets. Average chav isn't going to be able to tell a Ducati from a Yamaha just by the amount it peaks out from underneath. They're much more likely to go for the shiny - that gorgeous bike that is uncovered and just asking to be pinched.

Datatags, trackers etc - these don't stop theft, they just improve the chances of retrieval (even if that improvement is minuscule). If you can afford them then do it - but I wouldn't use them as a means of prevention.

But in truth, all this will only deter the average ASBO-tootin', chavtastic scumbag. Seasoned bike thieves are impossible to stop, but matey chops who learnt how to break a steering lock from his older brother who learnt it from a gypsy down the pub is much easier to thwart.

But let's just suppose we do humour the assassination idea and that, despite an absurd amount of testing/vetting, there is some significant contingent of immoral people in the secret services who want to kill a colleague for some reason. And, let's assume that the head of MI6 is complicit as well (as he would have to be, as the person is working for them). Not only that, but all the heads of GCHQ are also aware and complicit, as he is still technically in their care. Then, assuming all of that is true, instead of poison, stabbing or any other reliable form of murder, they go to the guys house, and without force or drugs (his body has no signs of either) they lock him into a bag in the hope that the zip is strong enough that he can't get out. Then, instead of getting rid of the body, they leave it in a highly suspect position bound to draw attention. They do this so that everyone who knows what he was up to (which is so bad that two of the directors of security services want him dead) which has to be common knowledge in the entire organisation, as well as knowing that it is MI6 who murdered him (because otherwise it's meaningless anyway) is sent a message that they could be killed. 

And on top of that, we then assume that no one involved at any stage of this process leaks anything, despite having a direct threat to their life, and none of them try to defect either. And, furthermore, it doesn't come out that this assassination was known to GCHQ or the NSA at the time of the Snowden leaks, unless Snoqden thought for some reason that spying on public = bad, murder = 100% fine.

Bob (and I) would disagree. Council housing was a response to the failure of private industry to be able to cater for the need for new houses. Since they stopped building council houses, we are facing the same problem again.

Your solution is to force people out of their council houses once they reach an income threshold, to reserve the few remaining ones for the very poorest.

Bob's solution would be to build more council houses.

From Wikipedia:
&gt; In the immediate post-war years, and well into the 1950s, council house provision was shaped by the New Towns Act 1946 and the Town and Country Planning Act 1947 of the 1945–51 Labour government. At the same time this government introduced housing legislation that **removed explicit references to housing for the working class** and introduced the concept of ""general needs"" construction (i.e., that council housing should aim to fill the needs for a wide range of society). In particular, Aneurin Bevan, the Minister for Health and Housing, promoted a vision of new estates where ""the working man, the doctor and the clergyman will live in close proximity to each other"".",null,0,null,1439819848,null,null,false,0,cu5v1rv,null,t3_3hat02,null,null,null,t1_cu5ugzo,null,null,null,1441301480,null,6,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

Subject to the provisions of the Membership Agreement, after the completion of the minimum membership term, a member may cancel his membership at any time by written request to the Member Relations Manager, giving one clear calendar's months’ notice of the desired cancellation date. All cancellation requests must be given by the 1st of the month in order for the membership to end on the 1st of the following month.

6.3.          A contractual membership may be cancelled due to a complete relocation, medical reason or redundancy. This constitutes a move of over 20 miles from the Club address, a letter from member’s doctor or employer. Documentation must be given to the MRM along with one clear months’ notice in order for the cancellation to be authorised. 

6.5.          Any monies outstanding are required to be paid in full, prior to re-joining the Club. 

6.6.           It is the responsibility of the member to cancel his Direct Debit with his bank on termination of his membership. The Club cannot be held liable for any payments processed due to the failure of a member to cancel a Direct Debit and no refund will be processed.  

6.7.          The Club has nominated a third party debt collection agency. Failure to collect outstanding monies from members, after a reasonable period, will be passed to this collection company to retrieve the outstanding debt. All costs incurred by a third party, including any searches as a result of change of address, will be borne by the member. 

6.8. 10 opt out period for all new members. No refund will be processed should the member utilise the facilities within the- opt out period.

6.9.                 A member who opts for the membership whereby a pre-payment is due, and wishes to cancel within their minimum term, cannot receive a reimbursement of the remaining fees, but can transfer their membership to another person, who will then complete the membership term.'

I wouldn’t say Traoré is a reject. He’s a pretty hot prospect in my opinion and he’s still young - Barcelona also added a three-year buyback clause in his contract. Of course a lot of the big teams do that nowadays in case one of the players they offload turn out to be good enough, but still. Having said all that, he’s young and out of practice so I’m not worried.

I’m also not concerned about their other players. None of them (except maybe Grealish) really strike me as game-changers, unlike our midfield. I could, however, see Gestede bagging a goal purely because he was one of our transfer targets last year.

Do I expect us to beat Villa? Yes.

Do I think we will? I don’t know; I think it could go either way.

Expecting a win never comes easily to us Palace fans. We’re used to pulling out some great results, only to squander the “easy” games. But I think it’s time we accepted we’re a solid Premier League team for now. Yeah, I could see us in a relegation struggle a few years down the road but right now, with the squad we’ve got, we should be beating Villa. We should be beating a lot of the teams in the league.

It’s just a situation we have to get used to. I swear, every time we win it almost comes as a shock, no matter who it’s against. 

But do I think we’re starting to get arrogant with our expectations for a win? Hell no.

We’re Palace. We’ve spent too many years dwelling in disappointment. It’s about time we starting thinking of ourselves as a winning team. We’ve got the quality, the spirit, the support. It’s high time we realised that we’re not being arrogant expecting a win – we’re being realistic.

That’s why it’s so bloody disappointing when we do lose: because it’s no longer something we expect as a matter of course.

Another example we have plaques and/or memorials to Bobby Sands and the hunger strikers in tons of countries, and reactions to his death show a good amount of support;

&gt; In* **Europe**, there were widespread protests after Sands's death. 5,000 Milanese students burned the Union Flag and chanted 'Freedom for Ulster' during a march.[5] The British Consulate at Ghent was raided.[5] Thousands marched in Paris behind huge portraits of Sands, to chants of 'the IRA will conquer'.[5] 

&gt; In the Portuguese Parliament, the opposition stood for Sands.[5] In Oslo, demonstrators threw a tomato at Elizabeth II, the Queen of the United Kingdom, but missed (The 28-year-old assailant claimed that he had not aimed for the queen, but rather for a smirking British soldier).
[5][35] 

&gt; In the Soviet Union, Pravda described it as 'another tragic page in the grim chronicle of oppression, discrimination, terror, and violence' in Ireland. Russian fans of Bobby Sands published a translation of the ""Back Home in Derry"" song (""На Родину в Дерри"" in Russian).[5] 

&gt; Many French towns and cities have streets named after Sands, including in Nantes, Saint-Étienne, Le Mans, Vierzon, and Saint-Denis.[36] In the Republic of Ireland, Sands's death led to riots and bus burning. 

&gt; **Africa**: News of the death of Bobby Sands influenced the way in which political prisoners and the ANC in South Africa responded to their own situation, and inspired a new way of resistance.[37][38] Nelson Mandela was said to have been ""directly influenced by Bobby Sands"",[37] and instigated a successful hunger strike on Robben Island.

&gt; **Americas**

&gt; A number of political, religious, union and fund-raising institutions chose to honour Sands in the United States. The International Longshoremen's Association in New York announced a 24-hour boycott of British ships.[39][40] Over 1,000 people gathered in New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral to hear Cardinal Terence Cooke offer a Mass of reconciliation for Northern Ireland. Irish bars in the city were closed for two hours in mourning.[5] In Hartford, Connecticut a memorial was dedicated to Bobby Sands and the other hunger strikers in 1997, the only one of its kind in the United States. Set up by the Irish Northern Aid Committee and local Irish-Americans, it stands in a traffic circle known as Bobby Sands Circle at the bottom of Maple Avenue near Goodwin Park.

&gt; The New Jersey General Assembly, the lower house of the New Jersey Legislature, voted 34–29 for a resolution honouring his ""courage and commitment.""

&gt; In 2001, a memorial to Sands and the other hunger strikers was unveiled in Havana, Cuba.

&gt; **Asia and the Middle East**

&gt; In Tehran, Iran, President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr sent a message of condolence to the Sands family.[51] 

&gt; The government renamed Winston Churchill Boulevard, the location of the Embassy of the United Kingdom in Tehran, to Bobby Sands Street, prompting the embassy to move its entrance door to Ferdowsi Avenue to avoid using Bobby Sands Street on its letterhead.[52]

&gt; A street in the Elahieh district is also named after Sands.[53] An official blue and white street sign was affixed to the rear wall of the British embassy compound saying (in Persian) ""Bobby Sands Street"" with three words of explanation ""militant Irish guerrilla"".[51][54] 

&gt; The official Pars News Agency called Bobby Sands's death ""heroic"".[51] There have subsequently been claims that the British foreign secretary has pressured Iranian authorities to change the name of Bobby Sands Street but this is denied.[55][56][57]

&gt; In Israel/Palestine, Palestinian prisoners incarcerated in the Israeli desert prison of Nafha sent a letter, which was smuggled out and reached Belfast in July 1981, which read;

&gt; ""To the families of Bobby Sands and his martyred comrades. We, revolutionaries of the Palestinian people...extend our salutes and solidarity with you in the confrontation against the oppressive terrorist rule enforced upon the Irish people by the British ruling elite. We salute the heroic struggle of Bobby Sands and his comrades, for they have sacrificed the most valuable possession of any human being. They gave their lives for freedom.""

&gt; In the Indian Parliament, opposition members in the upper house Rajya Sabha stood for a minute's silence in tribute. The ruling Congress Party did not join in.[5] Protest marches were organised against the British government and in tribute to Sands and his fellow hunger strikers.

&gt; A large monument dedicated to Irish protagonists for independence from Britain, including Bobby Sands, stands in the Waverley Cemetery in Sydney.

&gt; The Grateful Dead played the Nassau Coliseum the following night after Sands died and guitarist Bob Weir dedicated the song ""He's Gone"" to Sands.[65] The concert was later released as Dick's Picks Volume 13, part of the Grateful Dead's programme of live concert releases.

&gt; Songs written in response to the hunger strikes and Sands's death include songs by Black 47, Nicky Wire, Meic Stevens, The Undertones,[66] Bik McFarlane and Eric Bogle. Christy Moore's song, ""The People's Own MP"", has been described as an example of a rebel song of the ""hero-martyr"" genre in which Sands's ""intellectual, artistic and moral qualities"" are eulogised.[67] American rock band Rage Against the Machine have listed Sands as an inspiration in the sleeve notes of their self-titled début album.[68] and as a ""political hero"" in media interviews.[69]

It has also helped perpetuate a labour blackmarket simply through having such free border controls. Some Eu citizens work illegally, to such an extent it is encouraging illegal immigrants to come, knowing they can get work too.

The document I linked to in my previous post was the presentation of that report by Richard Murphy himself, with an explanation of his methodology and his critique of HRMC's current standards of measurement. If you read it through, you'll see how he comes to the £120bn figure.

&gt;It will be noted that in some areas I simply accept HMRC estimates of tax evasion: on occasion there is no reason not to do so. The estimates are likely to be sound. This is especially true of errors within the tax system where the IMF noted that HMRC performed well when reviewing their work in 2o13. The IMF were, within the boundaries of the normal diplomatic language they use and the fact that they were consultants on this occasion and no consultant overtly criticises their client, not so complimentary about HMRC’s ability to capture data on errors outside the tax system – which, of course, is precisely what most tax evasion is. Here they thought there was room for improvement in HMRC performance and I have explicitly looked for areas where I think this is likely to be the case. 

- See more at: http://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2014/09/22/new-report-the-tax-gap-is-119-4-billion-and-rising/#sthash.EfcUFYyU.dpuf

His critique is centred upon methodological flaws in HMRC's calculations. Here's a little extract to help illustrate that:

&gt;Third, when it comes to tax evasion, what the estimates I offer really suggest are that HMRC’s estimation methods are woefully inadequate. It is simply absurd to estimate losses to tax evasion on the basis of the tax returns that are submitted to HMRC when, very obviously, the failure to submit a tax return at all is the main way in which a tax evader seeks to achieve their goal of non-declaration of tax owing. This seems to be so glaringly obvious it should not need pointing out, and yet it has to be, because as a matter of fact HMRC do not look at data outside the tax system to estimate most of the tax evasion gap. It is, inevitably, and seriously, understated as a result due to the most basic of methodological errors on its part that fundamentally undermines the credibility of the data it has to offer.

You can see the full presentation of the figures, methodology, and various other criticisms in the full PCS report aqui: http://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Documents/PCSTaxGap2014Full.pdf

If 10% of that £120 billion was recouped then Osbourne wouldn't need to levy the further 12bn worth of welfare cuts. So there are very real world effects of not clamping down. Moreover, on a purely economic level, 12bn spent on welfare means 12bn pumped back into the economy, as all that money is to be spent by claimants, and spent within the British economy. The same cannot be said for 12bn left to tax evaders - particularly companies like Vodafone which may owe as much as £6bn, or Google and Amazon which are based outside the UK.

And that's only 10% of Murphy's estimates. Even HMRC's official figures are pushing £30bn.

Lastly, I don't believe the British economy has recovered. Improved, yes, of course - the world economy has. But recovered? I don't believe so. And any first world economy which is classified as recovered while families rely on foodbanks and homeless abounds, is not the kind of economy I, nor other Corbyn sympathisers, wish to see.",null,0,null,1439820965,null,null,false,0,cu5vm5v,null,t3_3h4yve,null,null,null,t1_cu5te93,null,null,null,1441301748,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

There are hundreds of studies carried out every year which link various things to various diseases, or suggest that various things might help treat or prevent various diseases. People like you only seem to be interested in the results of these studies when they involve cannabis, and at a guess I would suggest that this may have something to do with the fact these people also like using cannabis to get high. If you want the media to tell us every time a clinical trial or a study suggests something about a drug then that's fine, but no medical professional would take a study like that seriously in the absence of a great number of others supporting the data and a systematic review. 

Regardless of the veracity of the results, which I'm not necessarily trying to refute, these studies do not recommend the use of cannabis as a prophylactic not as a treatment for the disease, nor would they because of the reasons which I've already gone into.

That's definitely a fair outlook. I mean, essentially the reason why I say we should have a female Doctor now is because I do believe that there's a great number of ways it could advance the story, and now probably is the right time. (There have been, I would argue, other right times, but also wrong times, in the past.)

Agreed on why losses are disappointing, even Arsenal. Obviously they are much better than us but we certainly gave them a game and a point wouldn't have been undeserved.

We'd want her to talk about how having her benefits taken away would have given her the motivation to lose weight, and how great she feels now that she\'s thin and supporting herself.

Essentially Blair had the luxury, during his years in office post Major, of a poorly led Tory party and the widespread belief that voters on the left 'had no place else to go'. This belief slowly began to shatter as first the Lib Dems, then UKIP, then the SNP and Greens began to pickup votes from the old Labour base until we reach the present day.

It's no longer possible to pursue Blair's strategy of taking the left for granted while chasing the centre in the UK. The left have a place to go and the tories are back squatting on the centre as well. It's still slightly more possible to take the right for granted - they lose votes to UKIP too, but it's a more manageable one-directional fragmentation than Labour's. I do wonder how long that will remain true though. A quick glance across the ocean to the US shows how much more extreme a rightwing party can go.

In conclusion 2005 Blair was about as popular as 2010 Milliband with the electorate - despite the general media perception. Their varied electoral fortunes have more to do with what was going on with the Lib Dems and the SNP than it does the ability of the leaders.

This has been Labour's biggest problem as of late, the belief that Britain is inherently right-wing.  
And it's this pandering that's lead their core working-class electorate to turn to UKIP and the SNP.  

This is what Blair and the other Labour leaders took for granted in 1997; the working classes trusted Labour, and would vote for them. All they needed to do was adjust their policies and image to get the more fickle middle-class vote.  
  
Now that Labour has shifted so far to the centre, the core working class voters have become disillusioned, and turned to parties who they believe better represent them.

Overall, I think this voting system is great, but without a genuine choice of candidates that I support (i.e. I think that two of them would be ok, but prefer one overall), I can only vote for the only one whose policies I agree with, so I'm not putting second preferences.

As for deputy, I've heard next to nothing about any of them, except vague descriptions of how 'Corbyn-friendly' they are, so I'm going to pick them in that order, using my preferences (giving priority to female candidates, to give a balance if Corbyn wins), as there is a high chance that my preferences will come into play, and may help select a least worst option.

null,null,TheRedVanMan,null,null,null,"&gt; How does being part of a larger labour market encourage illegal immigration?

It all comes down to our borders and the lack of control. Anyone who has an EU passport can come here, they don't need to have a job or somewhere to live. They can just waltz in.

For starters there's a massive problem with faked EU passports, and has been for over a decade now. So basically people can get into Britain who aren't even from the EU. Again reports of this for over a decade.

The Labour Black Market is a big problem for many European countries suffering from the global recession. Again there's been articles about it for years. People work with no contracts and for less than minimum wage, because that's all the work they can find.

With the massive amount of people now available to employers in Britain, and the influx of so many potential employees, these problems have been brought here. They already existed to some degree of course, but not on such a scale. With the wage disparity between countries it's made even worse.

So now people who can't get an EU passport have realised this too, they can come here illegally and still get work, which naturally encourages them to come even more.

It was also Labour's lowest share of the vote since 1918, and the Lib Dem/Liberal's lowest since 1970. The reason is there was a big jump in turnout this election and the majority of new voters went SNP, which pushes all the other parties vote share down even if they actually lose any support.

Looking at the numbers, the Conservatives didn't actually do that badly, especially for an incumbent government. Their number of votes went up from 412,855 in 2010 to 434,097 this election.

I often travel around Europe, and compare/shop for different products in different countries. Different countries fix prices according to what the population will pay. For example just compare Dulux paint from B&amp;Q with the Brico Depot (both chains are the same company) and you will find 30-50% increase in France.

The main issue is that the coefficients are based over the last 5 years. The season that just dropped off, we had around 7 points more than Italy (18.4 vs 11.5). The next season to drop off will be 11/12, which saw us beat Italy by 4 points (15.2 vs 11.3).

These two seasons (where English teams did really well) not being counted any longer has a massive blow on our coefficients. At the moment, we're only around 3 points ahead of Italy. When you take into account Italy finished 4.5 points ahead of us last season, it's very possible for them to move above us this season.

null,null,justNickoli,null,null,null,"&gt;&gt; How does being part of a larger labour market encourage illegal immigration?

&gt;It all comes down to our borders and the lack of control. Anyone who has an EU passport can come here, they don't need to have a job or somewhere to live. They can just waltz in.

They still need the means to sustain themselves, they aren't eligible for the vast majority of benefits until they've been living here for a while. In practical terms, this means they need a job, or bring money with them that they put into the local economy. 

&gt;For starters there's a massive problem with faked EU passports, and has been for over a decade now. So basically people can get into Britain who aren't even from the EU. Again reports of this for over a decade.

No, there is not a ""massive problem with faked EU passports"". There have been a handful of incidents. 

&gt;The Labour Black Market is a big problem for many European countries suffering from the global recession. Again there's been articles about it for years. People work with no contracts and for less than minimum wage, because that's all the work they can find.

If it's caused by the global recession, then isn't that the cause? We would have been affected by the global recession without being in the EU, it was largely due to banks having massive exposure to bad debt in the US. 

&gt;With the massive amount of people now available to employers in Britain, and the influx of so many potential employees, these problems have been brought here. They already existed to some degree of course, but not on such a scale. With the wage disparity between countries it's made even worse.

All those extra people are spread across extra countries as well. Immigrants as a whole add more to the economy than they cost. This is the strongest part of your argument, but it's not at the level you seem to think it is. It's also something that could be dealt with by better enforcement of existing legislation. 

&gt;So now people who can't get an EU passport have realised this too, they can come here illegally and still get work, which naturally encourages them to come even more.

Illegal immigrants are generally poorly informed on conditions in the countries they are moving to. Your point here is somewhat confused. People are being exploited, so other people think ""I want to go and be exploited too, I'll move to the UK illegally!""?

Obviously, having made these arguments quite a few times, I've seen a few common responses, which I'll deal with here. I'm not trying to take on the entire Corbyn programme, here, just the usual responses I get when I suggest that he's unelectable. I have to split these across two posts, too, so bear with me!

###Of course Corbyn's electable! He's held his seat since 1983!

Of all the terrible arguments I've heard, this has to be just about the worst. The fact that Corbyn [has made it himself](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/here-are-the-four-most-common-misconceptions-about-me-and-my-campaign--and-the-truth-10443302.html) is, I honestly believe, one of the strongest arguments against him: He must know how stupid it is, yet he apparently thinks I'm so stupid that I'll buy it. [This New Statesman article](http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/08/no-jeremy-corbyns-record-islington-north-does-not-prove-hes-electable) sums up why it's so stupid quite accurately. In brief, all his electoral record shows is that he can hold a safe seat for Labour, which virtually anybody can. At most it proves that the people of Islington North think he's a decent MP (probably). And even this doesn't mean that they think he'd make a good Leader or PM (although I suspect that they do).

###What about Syriza and Podemos? They took on austerity narratives and won!

Obviously some of you are now thinking of Posak and PSOE, the social democratic parties of Greece and Spain. They have both been steamrollered by parties to their left (as Labour was in Scotland, although arguably the SNP aren't really that left-wing) and, people assert, this means that a radically left-wing Labour Party could be swept into power. This is a very understandable argument, and I do agree we can learn lessons from Podemos on party organisation and transparency, but it's slightly wrong-headed for a number of reasons.

Firstly, spurious comparisons with Greece are normally the preserve of the right-wing, so it's faintly amusing to see the left using them now. Syriza won power – just – in a country with a youth unemployment rate of 50%, which the UK is nowhere near, and Spain has a similarly dire problem with youth unemployment. Likewise, the UK has not had debt-reduction policies forced upon it by the IMF, the World Bank and the EU: It's voted for them. The polls show people still support it (see Cruddas, above)), which is why [over 50% of [**Edit:**] ~~the population~~ those who voted, voted [**/end edit**] for right wing parties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_2015#Results) and – if you believe the narrative that Labour was 'austerity-lite' (which the general public don't, as Cruddas also shows) – nearly 90% of the country voted for a party promising to implement some form of austerity!

Secondly, both Podemos and Syriza had the advantage of being new parties, ones with none of the baggage of their opponents. Labour has no such luxury, as the frequent comparisons between now and the 1980s show. Unlike Podemos and Syriza's opponents, the Conservatives know exactly what their attack lines against a Corbyn-led party will be: Labour's profligacy, our being in hock to the unions, the choice between Tory stability and Labour chaos – all of them will be trotted out with renewed vigour against a candidate who seems to so thoroughly embody all three.

###You can't just compare this with 1983!

This would be a fair argument if I had ever said: 'This is exactly like 1983', and then never presented any further evidence. Obviously it isn't exactly like 1983. However, it should be obvious that you can, in fact, derive lessons from the past. Since the last time we elected a leader from the far left of the party we went on to a famous electoral defeat it should hardly surprise anyone that people make the comparison.

In any case, neither I (nor, really, anyone else) is suggesting that things will turn out exactly like 1983, just that the 1983 election provides one of many pieces of evidence that a Hard Left leader is unlikely to win.

###None of the other candidates can win!

As I mentioned above, this argument is usually presented to me as a statement of fact by someone who has just declared that I cannot know for a fact that Corbyn can't win. My response is: Maybe not. But there's losing while making progress, and there's losing while going backwards. Neil Kinnock these days is well-respected by most of the party for having gradually moved the party closer to victory (by, among other things, fighting the extreme left elements of the party). We may well be electing a Kinnock, rather than a Blair. However, the situation is rather different from Kinnock's: He was taking on a Tory party that had won a landslide, whereas whoever leads us into the next election will be taking on a party with, at most, a 12-seat majority. If we win just 12 seats from the Tories, we've removed their majority and they will either have to govern alone as a minority (easier for Parliament to influence) or a second Coalition. This is far from a given and so we should try and pick the leader best able to do this.

###We should focus on winning over left-wing voters, not capitulating to the Conservatives!

Unfortunately, even if we won over every left-wing voter in the country (i.e., the Greens, the SNP and the rest got zero votes and they all transferred to us), we'd [still not win a majority](http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/charliecadywould/2015/08/lurch-to-the-left-or-the-right-where-labour-and-the-tories-must-position-themselves-to-win-in-2020/). Over half of ~~the electorate~~ those who voted, voted for a right wing party in 2015 (Tory, Ukip, UUP, DUP or Lib Dem – and yes, it's still over half – just – if you leave out the Lib Dems). We're outnumbered. We have to win them over to us to win.

A variation of this argument is that we have to win back Scotland. Yet even if we won every single seat in Scotland and all other things remained the same, the Tories would still have a majority (albeit one of 11, rather than 12).

A further flaw with both arguments is that they seem to assume that we could win over left-wing voters without losing any right-wing voters. This seems unlikely. Admittedly, the converse also seems somewhat unlikely, but winning votes from the Tories brings us closer to beating them even if we lose a few votes the other way. The same cannot be said for the other way round.",null,0,null,1439824123,null,null,1439842537,0,cu5xcvn,null,t3_3hbmvb,null,null,null,t3_3hbmvb,null,null,null,1441302568,null,16,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,16,null

- Heather honey - honey made by bees that live on heather.

- Marmalade - I know this isn't uniquely British but I think we have our own style of making it. Mackay's Orange Marmalade with Whisky or Mackay's Vintage Dundee Orange Marmalade are good choices.

As I said, these are split across two posts!

###Aren't non-voters more likely to vote Labour?

I refer you again to the TUC post-mortem poll, which shows that non-voters are roughly the same in their political beliefs as voters. If we could win over exclusively those non-voters who are inclined to Labour, we might get somewhere, but unfortunately they mainly live in Labour safe-seats – for example, Tristram Hunt's [safe Labour seat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoke-on-Trent_Central_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29#Elections_in_the_2010s) had the lowest turnout in the country in 2015 (IIRC – I can't find a list anywhere!), with just 49.9% of the elctorate turning out. If every one of those non-voters turned out, it obviously wouldn't affect the Tory majority one jot.

###Trying to be electable is just what Tony Blair did and he lost eventually!

This is a daft argument, and all we have to do to see how daft it is, is to imagine the converse: The Prime Minister who never loses! Of course, such a thing wouldn't (and shouldn't) ever happen in a democracy. Indeed, while Blair did eventually (and, in my view, rightly) become deeply unpopular, he nonetheless holds a unique distinction: He is the only Labour leader who never lost a general election. In that sense, he may have been lucky that he was ousted from within the party!

Most British Prime Ministers over the last hundred years [won only one majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Prime_Ministers_of_the_United_Kingdom#20th_century). That is to say, they were sufficiently popular to win a majority once. Blair, however unpopular he became, was sufficiently popular to win three majorities. Dismissing these because he 'eventually became unpopular' is, as I said above, just daft.

###Corbyn's policies are popular!

Yes, some of Corbyn's policies are popular. However, as the Conservatives discovered in 2005, and we rediscovered in 2015, having popular policies is not always enough to get you elected. There are a lot of reasons for this. What it comes down to is basically two things: People will often say they agree with a policy but they don't consider it sufficiently important to make them switch their vote (e.g. rail nationalisation); or they agree with a policy in abstract but don't really consider it practical (e.g. basic income).

###I saw a poll saying Corbyn was the most popular with the elecorate!

This is one of the strongest pro-Corbyn arguments and is clearly a big factor. However, immediately before the 2010 election, [Nick Clegg was the country's most popular politician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Clegg#Standing_in_the_polls), and he won fewer seats than in the last election (even though his party's vote share increased and he, of course, managed to get his party into government). Before 2015, Nigel Farage was the most popular leader of any nationwide party, and he couldn't even win the seat he was standing in! Going further back, Jim Callaghan was more popular than Thatcher, and frequently the incumbent Prime Minister remains ahead on 'leadership' and 'looks “Prime Ministerial”' right up to polling day but nonetheless goes on to lose,  as was the case for Gordon Brown.

So, the popularity of the leader is obviously important, and I'm enormously glad that any Labour MP is so popular, but it will not necessarily transfer into a general election win, which is what we want. I also have to say, given their track record, that I'm not completely convinced that many Tory voters weren't trolling the opinion pollsters when they said they liked Corbyn best.

###Lots of people have signed up to vote for Corbyn!

Again, this is something I'm obviously happy about: I want lots of people to join Labour (although I'm the Membership Secretary for my Branch, so now I have loads of extra work to do). But this only proves that lots of left-wing people support Corbyn, which we already knew. It's probably fair to assume that most people who signed up to vote for Corbyn also voted Labour in 2015 (or at most Green or Lib Dem), in which case he may indeed be able to make our base rock-solid, but not necessarily reach out beyond it. I have yet to meet a Corbyn supporter who voted for anything right of Labour.

If you told me loads of people who voted Tory in 2015 were signing up to vote Corbyn for genuine reasons (i.e., not 'to consign Labour to electoral oblivion', as Toby Young put it), then I'd agree we were onto something!

###Rallies!

This is basically the same argument as the one above. Again, this proves he's very popular with left-wing people.

There's a lot of technical skill, but not much raw power. And the players seem tired already at the start of the season. When I saw they barely get a few weeks off between post-season tour and pre-season tour.. I knew it would be a problem. Why do we have a post-season tour anyway? End of May, when the season ends, they go home and rest for a month. That's how it should be.

And Costa seems lost, just like previous failed strikers. It's worrysome, and more a symptom of poor midfield -- if they can't serve him, he can't score. And Falcao hasn't convinced me one single bit. I don't know what Mourinho sees in training, but they must be matched against the U21s, because this isn't good enough.

Maybe it's just me, but Hazard seems to be dealt with TOO easily now. Sure he gets one or two chances every game, but mostly he's disarmed when he tries something, and he has to play the ball back to the midfield. Sure, that keeps possession, but wouldn't it be better if he actually took a chance every now and then, and succeeded a couple of times out of ten? That would create a self-reinforcing threat. Defenders won't take as much risk because they know he won't play the ball backwards, but may just pass them. The first season he was extremely dangerous, and defenders feared him.

He should really just stop listening to Jose if he's the one who tells him to play it safe. Jose knows what he's capable of and still wants to tame him, which is pretty horrible. ManU were never more dangerous than when Beckham and Ronaldo respectively did whatever the hell they wanted and didn't restrict themselves.

I guess we differ in attitude.

That would end much of the exploitation of workers and allow wages to rise again, due to a normal workforce supply.

We have enough attacking talent that we shouldn't need an attacking left back to break them down. I'd rather have Gomez there to do what he seemingly does best, sit back when we have the ball and mop things up when an attack comes to his side.

This way, those less well off can lower their living expenses by avoiding the more expensive areas.

- Policing is expensive, and feet on the street are the best way of reducing crime. Thus, a fraction of council tax bills will be determined by the levels of crime at the postcode sector level. Those in higher crime areas get more beats, but have to bear the costs (understandably).

- The fee-based system you describe for education should be enhanced by setting fees based on students' results. Those who fail to perform reduce the desirability of their educational establishments, which should in turn be compensated for their lack of effort. £0 for an A* to £100 for an F.

It's down to a number of reasons. One is that a lot of players are playing above their level; for instance there's a number of first team players qualified to play for the U21's but don't because they're first team quality. The same applies in that there's a decent number of U18's that actually play for the U21's because they're a few years ahead. So the U18's often has 16 and sometimes even 15 year olds playing. Plus we've just had a change of U18 coach so it's just a case of settling him in and we've got several new U18 contracts signed within the past month so there's a lot more new faces. 

Also, at the end of the day as nice as it is to win, the U18 and U21 Premier League is only there to give youth more match time so as long as they're playing and improving the results don't actually matter that much!

There's no doubt that the initial conquering of Westeros brought about universal peace in the land for a long time.

Peace brought about at the end of a sword isn't really peace, it's simply quiet. People may have been okay under Targaryan rule, and heck Stockholm Syndrome may have played out on a large scale to the point where the people may have even liked them after a time. But the inbreeding of the royal family was suffered through gritted teeth by pretty much everyone in Westeros due to a clash of culture. Plus, that inbreeding brought about some fucking awful people that got to the throne, like Maegor the Cruel and Aerys II.

Sure, you had Rhaegar who was by accounts a noble character, but even he ended up robbing someone else's betrothed that was indeed the last straw. It seems to me like the people who want the Targaryans back are either those few who are still around to remember their rule, and have Stockholm Syndrome about the whole affair. Those too young to remember Targaryan rule and yet still want it are probably children/grandchildren of those who want them back, being told stories of Targaryan rule through some majorly rose-tinted glasses, as nostalgia is wont to produce.

* Fat	- 3.2g (of which saturates 2.4g)

[Low Fat Natural Yogurt](http://groceries.asda.com/product/natural-greek/asda-low-fat-natural-yogurt/37629455)    
* Fat	- 1.4g (of which saturates 1.0g)

* Carbohydrate - 7.7g (of which sugars 7.7g)  


These are all per 100g for 500g pots of ASDA's own brand. You can see how that a reduction in fat sees an increase in sugar content.
