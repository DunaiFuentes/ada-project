Well, it possible that it could be subconsciously so, but I don't think so.  I don't particularly care about the economics of it.  I don't really consider it a waste of money... spending that much on a young player is a gamble, but it was obviously a calculated gamble.  No one can predict how these things are going to play out, so I'm not too disappointed that we splurged on him.  (For example, I also am not fully convinced Danny Rose or Mason should be in our starting XI full time yet, and they didn't break the bank.)

For me it's more about whether he's working in the side or not.  I don't think he is for the reasons mentioned above.  Serie A, where he did look good, is a much easier league to play in (and I say this as an Italian who follows it closely) physically, and so his glory season at Roma allowed him to be slower on the ball than he can possibly be in the EPL.  The pace and space afforded to him obviously suited his game well in Italy.  It doesn't make him a bad player that here he can't reproduce it, but it is realistic to say that the pace and intensity of the play in England doesn't suit him well.

So we can persist with him in the hope that the additional game time will make him come good, but I think it's a case of diminishing returns now.  And besides, the fact Poch isn't starting him much means that he obviously isn't impressing on the training pitch either.

null,false,[deleted],null,null,null,"&gt; A player will have to have been registered with his club from the age of 15 - down from 18 - to qualify as 'home-grown'. The minimum number of home-grown players in a club's first-team squad of 25 will increase from eight to 12, phased over four years from 2016.

Our squad information is available [here](http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/clubs/profile.squads.html/chelsea). So currently there are 16 (Fabregas registered when he was 16 so he will not be HG) non-HG players. The proposed limit is 13 by 2020. So we should be fine with the current squad till 2017 at least giving us two years to prepare for the rule changes.

&gt; At least two home-grown players must also be 'club-trained' players - defined as any player, irrespective of nationality, that has been registered for three years at their club from the age of 15.

Most of our U-21 players in the squad are club trained and we expect players like Solanke and RLC to stay with us so that should not be an issue.

&gt; Only the best non-EU foreign players will be granted permission to play in England.

This should not be an issue for the top English clubs especially post regulations because we would looking for only the top players to fill our limited non-HG quota. The players in FIFA top 50 countries who have played a certain percentage of the internationals in the past 3 years would only be eligible. I am sure most of our non-EU players are internationals and should be eligible though I am not sure this applied to players who already have work permits.

Our loaning system might get affected though most of our loanees play overseas. It limits the options to loan out overseas players in England. There is a slight relaxation for under 21 players though.

Overall this system might favor the clubs with a good academy setup and generating proven performers for many years like Man Utd, Arsenal and Southampton. Thanks to our own academy the impact on us will be minimal though it places a lot of pressure on our academy to generate first team players. 

People have accused our academy is solely existing to bring up youth players so we can sell them and generate money to buy foreign players seeing that the chances of academy players in our first team are limited. Not debating the merits and the veracity of the accusation this is no longer an option. Considering that there will be an exorbitant ""HG tax"" on every HG player sold we have more  reasons now to work even more on our academy setup and have them improve constantly.

Personally I feel the PL clubs will negotiate and reduce the proposed changes to a middle ground in between the current and the proposed changes.

null,false,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,null,"So, happy with FSG; Unhappy with their decision to hire and retain Brendan Rodgers.

Fair enough, I suppose.

First off, I think you're failing to remember how close our club was to absolute disaster thanks to Hicks &amp; Gillett. FSG helped stabilise our club.

I think it's important to consider a quick timeline:

* 2009-10: Rafa is sacked after LFC finish 7th fielding a squad with the likes of Carragher, Gerrad, Alonso, Mascherano, Kuyt, Torres.
* 2010-11: Hodgson hired in summer '10; FSG take over in October '10; Sack Hodgson in January '11; Supporters practically demand Kenny Dalglish and the new ownership who were forced to make a mid-season change go with Dalglish and as a sign of good-faith dump loads of money into Luis Suarez and Andy Carroll. Finish 6th.
* 2011-12: We win the League Cup but finish 8th; Dalglish sacked at the end of the season.
* 2012-13: Rodgers hired, we finish 7th.
* 2013-14: We finish 2nd on the back of amazing performances by Luis Suarez an Daniel Sturridge.
* 2014-15: Here we are.

We are only approaching the end of Rodgers' third season. You can argue that his first season was spent figuring out his squad. In this second season -- with the help of SAS -- we reach 2nd but his squad is not in its final form. In his third season, he has struggled and then seemed to succeed again.

So now what?

Are you suggesting that Rafa be re-hired after Dalglish was sacked? Merely *two* years after Rafa was sacked for guiding our club to a 7th place finish with arguably a better squad? Furthermore, I'm not entirely sure Rafa himself was ready to return to managing Liverpool. And I'd argue that Rafa encounters a bit of friction with ownership because of his demands for control. New owners like FSG certainly wouldn't give a manager so much leverage especially when FSG are likely to want ""their guy.""

Rodgers is far from doing a perfect job but he is gradually constructing a squad that he feels is best and ownership is giving him the chance and the time to succeed.

We are starting to see the fruits of Rodgers' work this season (albeit, a bit later than I would have liked).

Personally, I tempered my expectation this season. It was hard for me to think that we'd come close to 2nd place especially with the loss of Suarez, a number of new players, still-developing young players and then, of course, Sturridge's injury did not help at all.

All that being said, I think the 2015-16 season is the make-or-break season for Rodgers. This is where I will fully expect our squad to comfortably finish in the top 4 (if not higher), go deep into the FA or League Cup (perhaps even winning one) and go deep into Europa League.

&gt; The Energy Catalyzer (also called E-Cat) is a purported cold fusion or Low-Energy Nuclear Reaction (LENR) heat source which was devised by inventor Andrea Rossi with support from physicist Sergio Focardi. An Italian patent, which received a formal but not a technical examination, describes the apparatus as a ""process and equipment to obtain exothermal reactions, in particular from nickel and hydrogen"". Rossi and Focardi said the device worked by infusing heated hydrogen into nickel powder, transmuting it into copper and producing heat. The international patent application received an unfavorable international preliminary report on patentability because it was adjudged to **""offend against the generally accepted laws of physics and established theories"".**

&gt; The device has been the subject of demonstrations and tests several times, and commented on by various academics and others, but no independent tests have been made, and no peer-reviewed tests have been published. Steve Featherstone wrote in Popular Science that by the summer of 2012 **Rossi's ""outlandish claims"" for the E-Cat seemed ""thoroughly debunked"" and that Rossi ""looked like a con man clinging to his story to the bitter end.""**",null,0,null,1427179868,null,0,false,0,cpovdxf,null,t3_3026ob,null,t1_cpovdxf,null,t1_cpogk00,null,null,null,1431980969,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Survey Method

We conducted a survey on a large, private online discussion group composed entirely of GPs. We asked for that were considered by that GP to be an inappropriate use of their time and skills. We received over 200 unique responses. We excluded very similar responses or those we considered might have conceivably have been a presentation of underlying illness.

Another large closed group was consulted about how best to present the findings, which were then published on our website in the prior to a general election.

Survey Responses

For ease of reference, and to help stimulate ideas for alternative solutions, we have divided these into six categories: cosmetic, normality, trivia, requests for prescriptions for everyday items, administrative and miscellaneous.

**Cosmetic**

Cream to make breasts bigger

Anti-ageing cream

“My son has a rash on his ankles every night” (sock marks)
“How do I get an eyelash out of my baby’s eye”

“I’ve bought these fancy anti ageing face creams. Can you look at the ingredients and tell me which order I should use them in?”

“My son’s shoes are rubbing him”

“I dreamt a few times my 12-yr-old daughter had stopped breathing. I was terrified I couldn’t help her”

“Doctor – my stomach makes this weird rumbling/gurgling noise whenever I haven’t eaten. Its starting to affect my work!”

“I have grey hairs….I’m nearly 40….have I got a medical condition?”

“I’m worried about a white lump in my baby’s gum.” The receptionist suggested it was a tooth. The irate mother suggested only a medically qualified person should judge that diagnosis. She demanded urgent appointment. It was indeed a tooth.

“I’ve lost my spidey-sense and need a test to find out why”

“I had an insect bite last week and it itched like hell. It’s gone now, but wondered if it will itch if I get another one?”

“My penis gets cold when I go outside.”

“My 10 yr old daughter won’t eat vegetables. Can you refer her to a hypnotherapist?”

A man presents with a yellow lump on his leg which had come up suddenly. This was triaged from a phone consultation to be an appropriate GP consultation. When the man attended, the GP pulled a gummy bear from the patients leg.

“Doctor, I cannot fart without making a noise”

“Doctor, I can’t face a bikini wax while I’m pregnant (it’s more painful than usual) so can you advise me how to tell my husband that I don’t feel sexy at the moment.”

A patient consulted as they were concerned their feet sweated when they wore trainers.

**Trivial**

Concerns that the doctor felt could have been addressed by any sensible adult

“Can you settle a marital dispute? My wife thinks paracetamol is better, I think ibuprofen is. Who’s right?”

“I have sneezed twice in the last hour”

“I have a scratch on my arm” (tiny 2 millimetre scratch. No infection).

“My child has turned blue” -the child had blue dye on him from a duvet cover which had not yet been washed.

Two emergency appointments for a cold sore. The first to tell the patient the diagnosis, the second (later that morning) 
because the grandmother (a nurse) disagreed with the original diagnosis.

“Has she been doing any drawing with crayons lately?”
“Yes? I suspect the blue one is missing!”

“I’m really worried my daughter has a splinter… can you get it out? We haven’t tried by the way, because we were so worried”

“I broke my nail”

A patient brought in divining rods connected to a computer. The computer concluded the patient was allergic to eggs. The patient then requested an allergy test to eggs.

“I sucked a bit of old baler twine a week ago and still have a funny taste in my mouth.”

“My husband was snoring last night – I recorded it so you could hear”

“Please can I have sleeping tablets as I live on a noisy street?”

“I’ve tinted my eyelashes but now there is pus everywhere and I can’t see. This has happened before when I had an allergic reaction when I dyed my eyelashes and I had to go to hospital. Can you stop it happening again?

A man presents to the GP on Friday and voices his anger about not being able to get an appointment until then despite the fact he had a sore throat 4 days earlier. His throat was now better. He continued to moan to the GP about the system, despite the fact the GP attempted to reassure the patient he had had a self-limiting illness as was evidenced by the fact he was now better. The patient left unable to appreciate he had not only wasted an appointment, but that he would have never needed to attend in the first place.

“I’ve just run my first marathon. My knee now hurts. I have not taken any pain killers but would like an urgent referral to physiotherapy.”

“When I clean my ears with cotton buds, it makes me cough. Why is that doctor?

A patient attended an appointment to tell the GP they had had diarrhoea in the last week which had now resolved. They felt it was important to let the GP know their self-limiting illness had settled.

“Doctor, my farts smell very bad”.

“I get indigestion when it’s cloudy and my child has ear discharge when there is a full moon”

A male patient who had been diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome reattended the GP concerned his symptoms might actually be due to ovarian cancer.

“My baby’s snot is just too green”.

A patient attended as they had stepped on a “slimy creature” the night before. This turned out to have been a slug.

A patient attended with symptoms of a blocked nose for 12 hours. The doctor advised some saline spray as a decongestant. The patient then angrily said to the GP “You are useless” and waved a hand in the GP’s face patronizingly saying “bye bye”.

“Doctor I have a cold, and I want to get well before marathon in 4 days. What can you do”

**Requests for prescriptions of everyday items**

Another very common experience for GPs, borne largely of the fact that those on low incomes pay nothing for items which are prescribed for them

Paracetamol or ibuprofen (extraordinarily common request, especially for children)

Sunscreen

Toothpaste

Anti-aging cream

Sudocrem

Shampoo (“to make my hair shiny”)

Chapstick (“because my lips are chapped”)

Bra (because of breast pain)

Multivitamins

Talcum powder (for sweating)

“Everything I need from the chemist: nappies, toothpaste, toilet roll and my shampoo”

“We are going on holiday so I would like a (free NHS) 
prescription for paracetamol, dioralyte, emollient and antibiotics just in case”.

Fortisip drinks (because “I don’t like cooking”)
these are fortified drinks for patients who are deficient in nutrition. They are often given to chronically unwell patients such as cancer sufferers who cannot eat properly.

A longstanding burden for GPs (see the 2001 Cabinet Office paper Making a Difference: Reducing GP workload). This work falls outside a GP’s NHS contract. Many GPs apply charges for this work, as they are entitled to, to attempt to recoup some of the costs relating to their own time and that of their staff in meeting these requests.

Footnote

These may sound like extreme examples, but they are all genuine, recent events. GPs report that whilst such requests are not new, they now occur far more frequently. At a time when there are more patients with long-term conditions requiring care from their GPs, and when the population is ageing, it is increasingly difficult to justify spending so much time dealing with matters such as those listed above.

I understand that is your position, but the reality is that hospitals are much better because of charitable donations. Without them, more people would die. Again, philosophically I would rather this wasn't the case, but hospitals are underfunded and I would rather help out of my own pocket than see people suffer. 

Completely agree that the richest in society, especially corporations, should be taxed more. As Brand pointed out, that they sponsor Comic Relief and profit from the good will is all the more galling. Their profits are obscene and should be used to better the country. There should be a windfall tax on them. A pint and a fight would be ideal ;)

Do you know about how the Foundation's investments have stripped doctors and nurses from other, often more important areas, to work on Gates projects?

Do you know about their investments in Fossil Fuels? 

Did you know that in 2008 the WHO’s head of malaria research, Aarata Kochi, accused a Gates Foundation ‘cartel’ of suppressing diversity of scientific opinion, claiming the organization was ‘accountable to no-one other than itself’. 

Did you know that Tido von Schoen Angerer, Executive Director of the Access Campaign at Médecins Sans Frontières, has said, ‘The Foundation wants the private sector to do more on global health, and sets up partnerships with the private sector involved in governance. As these institutions are clearly also trying to influence policymaking, there are huge conflicts of interests… the companies should not play a role in setting the rules of the game.’

Do you know about the Foundation's support for Intellectual Property Law (something MS have a storied history in) rather than pushing for medical access to poorer populations? 

Or how about research by Devi Sridhar at Oxford University warns that philanthropic interventions are ‘radically skewing public health programmes towards issues of the greatest concern to wealthy donors’. ‘Issues,’ she writes, ‘which are not necessarily top priority for people in the recipient country.’

null,false,GreyShuck,tom-baker,Tom Baker,null,"As for who would play the Doctor, well I came up with a possible list for this in reply to another, kinda similar, thread sometime back...

In 1899, the UK film industry wasn't exactly that well established, but across the channel, things were afoot...

Both the French and German film industries were in a more prominent position in those days. Clearly it would be film, rather than TV at this point, of course. However series of short films were quite popular, so it would be reasonable to expect the title to happen in that format.

When thinking of early French film, you can hardly avoid [Méliès](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0617588/) coming to mind. I really could see a series of shorts for the First Doctor in the style of *Le Voyage dans la Lune*. Of course Méliès himself played the starring role in many of his films, and I could see him as a Professor Barbenfouillis style Doctor. Curiously enough one of the other lunar voyagers was evidently called Omega, but that's another matter altogether. However, I think that even if we imagine the original appearance of the title at this point, the films would probably disappear as this prolific director moved on.

Perhaps, however, looking at the German film industry, a little later, [Paul Wegener](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Wegener) - director of *The Student of Prague*, *The Golem* etc. would buy the rights to the title from the earlier series of shorts from the financially distressed Méliès, and remake them (remakes were rife in this period). Wegener, too, would often star in his films, and I could see him as a passably recast First Doctor. 

Following this, WW1 would intervene and put a temporary halt to production, but I could so much see the Second Doctor kicking things off again with full blown post-war expressionism. I mean, who would not pay good money to see *The Mind Robber*,*The War Games* or just about any of Troughton's stories shot in the style of *The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari*? As for the actor, well I'd go with a pre-Nosferatu [Max Schreck](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0775180/?ref_=nv_sr_2).

Now, let's assume that we're staying in Germany just for a while, and go back to the young [Conrad Veidt](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0891998/?ref_=nv_sr_4), who had played *Cesare* in *Caligari*. Yes, just a little young, but I could see him moving towards his more usual suave look just a little later, as the Third Doctor.  

The Fourth Doctor, well in this timeline, [William Henry Pratt](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000472/?ref_=nv_sr_2) did not move directly to from the UK to Canada and then the US, but instead moved to Germany and made a hit as Boris Karloff in the increasingly popular film series, now with Fritz Lang at the helm.  

When the newly famous Karloff eventually moves to Hollywood, [Peter Lorre](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000048/?ref_=nv_sr_1) becomes the Fifth Doctor, and I think that along with Lorre's exile from Germany in '34, production of ""Doktor von Wer"" would move to the UK, with it's ever improving film industry, and it is then that we get the later titles.   

Six would be [Charles Laughton](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001452/?ref_=nv_sr_1), who would remain in the UK rather than flitting across to Holywood as often.  

Seven would have to be [Alastair Sim](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0799237/?ref_=nv_sr_3) establishing the show as distinctly British. Once again, however, the series is put on hold, with the outbreak of WW2.   

In 1946, the series is revived, briefly, on the big screen, with the Eighth Doctor played by the more romantic [James Mason](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000051/?ref_=nv_sr_4), delaying his rise to international stardom by a year or so.  Although the film proves to be a one off, Mason goes on to repeat his role very successfully in a radio version of the series. 

In 1955, with TV ownership, following the coronation, now relatively high, the series moves to the small screen for the first time. Nine, then, would be [Herbert Lom](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0007042/?ref_=nv_sr_1), making a break from his often rather villainous roles before this.  

Ten would be [Michael Rennie](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0719692/?ref_=nv_sr_1), delaying his role in the TV version of *The Third Man* by a year.  

Eleven would be a young [Tom Courteney](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0183822/?ref_=nv_sr_1), straight from his stage debut.  

In 1963, Twelve simply has to be [Peter Cushing](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001088/?ref_=nv_sr_2).

I think when you watch them you can see why there is more doubt about Costa's intent compared to Skrtel. Skrtel slows his steps as he sees De Gea is getting to the ball first, and then attempts a jump to avoid De Gea after he's already stamped on him. Compare that to Costa who is in mid air attempting to jump the slide from Skrtel, when Costa first jumps Skrtel's left leg, the one Costa eventually lands on, is facing a completely different direction to where Costa is running and likely to land. Skrtel spins round due to his momentum and puts his leg in the path of where Costa was already going (obviously not intentionally). Costa had a lot less knowledge and control over the situation due to how the players came together and the fact he was already in midair.

Just three years later and now he's one of the most sought after midfielders in the world and there are people here that would happily have Chelsea spend £50m+ on him. There's the Macheda example I gave as well, he was a complete nobody that Ferguson played in a much tighter title race when United were competing against their biggest rivals Liverpool. Fair enough Macheda never built on a fantastic start, but he was given the opportunity in a much more high pressure situation that most people are asking for Loftus-Cheek to go into. Thiago at Barcelona, 19 years old when he started regularly getting games, played over 100 times for Barcelona before moving to Bayern. There are so many examples of young players coming in from the youth and performing well, sometimes better than seasoned veterans. Everyone has to get a chance somewhere at some time.

2. No one visits. This is where 'seo' comes in. You pay some people to spam hundreds of word spun comments onto website comment pages with loads of hyperlinks in the comment like 'best hairdryer reviews online'.

3. You still don't get any traffic, so then you start paying people to direct shit traffic sources to you. Known of these 'convert' into sales.

4. Eventually you give up, and instead start trying to sell to others at step 1 or others just arriving at step 4. You make a blog and sell them snakeoil and stories of getting rich on the internet. You put photos of yourself up with a bottle of bubbly on the back of a speed boat. You get these unsuspecting desperados to pay you money to 'know your secrets to making money online'.

If your annual turnover is over £81,000 you also need to [register for VAT](https://www.gov.uk/vat-registration).  Again, possible awkward questions.

Given the potential issues of arrears and penalties it may be worth seeking specialist advice before contacting HMRC.  You can employ an accountant but if you're on a low income [TaxAid](http://taxaid.org.uk/) may be able to help.

The only thing you can't do online is claim Working Tax Credits - you have to [go through their helpline](https://www.gov.uk/working-tax-credit/how-to-claim).

My experience of tax credits was less than stellar - it was easy enough to set up but the calculations are pretty opaque.

Progression is slow in most roles. People work 5+ years before they get promoted most of the time. I appreciate that you don't feel like you're learning enough but that will come with responsibility. If it's really bothering you, look to learn a new craft or trade in your spare time so you can satisfy your yearn for knowledge. 

A major telecoms company has just lost a massive contract and the redundancy is huge. The company who won the contract have capitalised on it by lowering the salary of its current and new employees because their argument is 'we've paid for this contract to keep you in jobs'. 

If you've got it good, stick with it. If not, leave. You may regret staying, you may regret leaving.

All I can really say is keep your CV and LinkedIn updated and keep your eye on the job scene. LinkedIn is being increasingly used by Recruiters to headhunt. 

 During your appraisals, explain that you think that given your responsibility and the extra tasks you've taken on, plus the going rate for an OD/PM is £X, you'd like to discuss remuneration. If the MD says no, simply say that you must have overestimated your worth and you'll go and conduct some research into why you were wrong. This essentially says that you're looking for a new job without explicitly stating that you're looking for a new job.

&gt;The __Huns__ were a [nomadic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomad) group of people who are known to have lived in [Eastern Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe), the [Caucasus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasus), and [Central Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia) between the 1st century AD and the 7th century. They were first reported living east of the [Volga River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volga_River), in an area that was part of [Scythia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scythia) at the time; the Huns' arrival is associated with the migration westward of a Scythian people, the [Alans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alans).  They were first mentioned as Hunnoi by [Tacitus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacitus). In 91 AD, the Huns were said to be living near the [Caspian Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspian_Sea) and by about 150 AD had migrated southeast into the [Caucasus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasus).  By 370 AD, the Huns had established a vast, if short-lived, dominion in Europe.

null,false,insoundfromwayout,null,null,null,"It does if it's just *bullshit*. That's what I am saying. Balance doesn't always necessarily mean giving an equal voice to the opposite side. It *often* means that, but not always.

Like, to report in a balanced way on climate change doesn't mean to print as many articles saying climate change isn't real as you do articles that say it is real. Balanced in that occasion just means being fair with the facts. An anti-climate change article isn't given *value* simply by the fact that it gives another side to the story.

Similarly, if someone does something that almost everyone can agree is wrong, something illegal and immoral, like say some celebrity is videoed punting a pussycat down the road - every article would be condemning them, and rightly so. But that doesn't mean that an article giving the other side of the story, talking about the joys of abusing animals, is of any *value* simply in virtue of it giving another side to the story. It can still just be an absolutely indefensible piece-of-shit article. It *might* have value if it explained somehow, gave some insight like how the guy was kicking the cat out of the way of a bus which was out of shot in the video, that would obviously give it journalistic value. But just saying ""I kicked the cat, it wasn't so bad"" doesn't make it a good article just because it's giving some other side to things.

And like in this case; it's a story of a group of people getting together and finding a political figure while he is out for lunch with his wife and two little girls and getting aggressive and violent with them - that's something almost everyone can agree is not on. An article simply giving the other side and saying it's not so bad isn't immediately given value just in virtue of the fact that it is reporting on a side of the story not often being covered.

It *could* of course still turn out to be a good article for different reasons, if it, say, was brilliantly written or justified things in a way that won people around. But it isn't, and it doesn't justify shit. It doesn't even argue with what happened. It just tells the story from the other side with a huge focus on how righteous everyone is and a minimal focus on their aggressiveness and violence. It's just a piece of shit article of no real journalistic value, and the only reason they printed it is because lots of people at the fucking protest were Guardian contributors anyway. 

If they had any integrity the editors would say ""look, you fucked up, things got out of hand, you're just going to have to suck it up and deal with it, admit that you were wrong in this case, we can't just keep printing articles acting like you were the good guys"" - but they don't.

Maybe if the authors at the Guardian had passed some bloody GCSEs we might not get bullshit like this. 

If you want to know if academies are working you look at the average pass rate before they became academies, you look at the average pass rate now and you adjust for the change in pass rate for non-Academy schools over the same period. That might give you something appraoching a rigorous answer to the question.

They're a well known polling company. It doesn't change the fact that the CI paid for it. The methodology is also published online, so you can see it, and as I pointed out in my earlier post, it's fundamentally flawed.

null,false,DenningLJ,null,null,null,"Maybe this could have been explained a bit better in fairness (but christ knows if I'm going to make it clearer...). 

The OSA basically, for the purposes of this situation, stipulates that if you've signed the OSA and you're in the intelligence services or the police or a high ranking civil servant then you can't talk about /anything/ you've found it out through your job unless it is expressly within your remits to talk about it. There is no public interest defence, and what this means is that if you tell someone, such as the police or the press, something covered by the OSA then you've still broken the law and you can still be prosecuted. This happened to [Clive Ponting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clive_Ponting) about the [General Belgrano](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARA_General_Belgrano#Naval_outcome) when he revealed that we were out and out being lied to by the government. There just isn't a criminal defence in saying, 'the people should know this, it's not right'. You still go to prison and you still lose everything.

**So... how does this apply to historical sexual abuse?** 

Picture you're working for MI5 or Special Branch in the 70's and 80's and you're working on investigating the case of a paedophile MP or some of the ongoings at Dolphin House. You've got some solid evidence and you have a good idea of what is going on, so much so that arrests are made. You're on your way to prosecution but before that, someone higher up the chain, someone with powerful friends in the government walks in, confiscates all of your files and tells you that you're closing the case and none of this ever happened. Because of your job, you had to sign the OSA and the information you found out is covered by the OSA. If you go to the police with it now, with evidence of a cover up or of historical sexual abuse then you are breaking the law. There is no public interest defence, you're simply guilty of an offence by talking to the current investigation about it, even though its to an active investigation and to the police with evidence of criminality. You risk losing /everything/. Your home, your marriage, being locked up for the remainder of your life and having everything you've ever done discredited because you're now a traitor. 

**What would this amendment have done?** 

It would have put those individuals who have intelligence gained through official channels, such as the police or MI5 or senior civil servants, outside of the OSA. It expressly said, 'if you tell the police information about this that would have been covered by the OSA, you're not breaking the law and you will not be prosecuted'. 

**What did the Government do?** 

David Cameron and Theresa May told their party how they had to vote, under threat of punishment and they told them they were not allowed to give these people who may be scared of coming forward due to criminality any protection. The reason we've been told for this? They said 'we don't expect anyone to be prosecuted for this so there's not point really is there, it's ok chaps, nothing to worry about here'. 

however... 

As I've said in another reply in this thread, there are some very valid reasons for changing the law in this area. It is not the governments job to encourage people to break the law and say,'it's ok, we'll turn a blind eye to it.' 

So, the amendment has nothing to do at all with the people who took part in any way, it only covers those with information covered by the OSA.

2. Rodgers hasn't purchased a single pure defensive midfielder in 10 transfer windows as a Premier League manager. Why? A) we have Lucas and B) the role is too restrictive to his style. Also, Emre Can and Henderson who have both started filling that role can do the job fine at being physical while also moving box to box/high energy. His midfield needs to be free flowing - a DM dropped in front restricts fluidity in midfield.

3. Sturridge needs a run of games and to never play got England. 

Lambert has essentially done what he needed to do and us a good third option. 

Balotelli has proven he can be incredibly effective when paired with another striker - he simply suffers on his own. 

Borini is also a good option to have because he runs like a mad dog and presses the back line relentlessly. I still believe he's more effective as a wide forward though or in a striking pair.

Origi scored a hat trick recently, because Lille's manager decided to not play with three defensive/holding midfielders for once. He's had little to no support and has been forced to play both as a winger and striker in the same squad/matches to compensate. He will be amazing for us.

4. No, because at the moment, the 343/3412 gets our best and in form players on the pitch. As per team selection, I want to see Sterling back up too and Markovic coming back in at RWB. This would either force Lallana or Sturridge out of the team, unless of course we take out Moreno and move Lallana to LWB again. I do want Lucas back in the side.

We often expect so much from the footballers who are paid so much money to play a game. We set high standards for these footballers and hope that they are able to keep a level-head and clearly know right from wrong in the heat of a moment.

Meanwhile, we excuse the sometimes horrid actions of supporters because they've paid good money to support their club.

But that is not an excuse for a supporter to act like a complete cunt.

DM- BR simply doesn't rate having a DM as being vitally important.  I could see Lucas leaving in the summer because I doubt he will get a lot of time especially if they continue with 3 CBs. 

Sturridge. I agree.

Lambert was bought before Suarez left to be a stop gap and late player.  I like him a lot but he needs to play.  I'd say he is gone in the summer probably to West Brom or a club like that.  

Ballet  I love the kid but think he should move on as well.  The front three depends on fluidity, accurate passing and clever runs.  He is great at strength, skill and ability but he isn't a great fit for the system.  Perhaps he could fit but I just don't think LFC and BR have the patience.  Probably to Napoli 

Born  I respect that he wants to stay and fight but he is too young to not starting.  But he won't leave it seems.  

Origi  Lille haven't been great and neither has he but think he has the tools to fit into the system very quickly.  

4)  No, the tactics are fine.  Moreno, Sterling, Lallana and Allen all had games to forget.  They couldn't go on not losing forever and United played very well.  The midfield of Felliani, Herrera, Young, Mata and Carrick is quite dynamic and works well together, it will be hard for them to fall from top four.

null,false,StoriesToBeTold,null,null,null,"The rate of inflation faced by households has fallen to its lowest level on record. The Consumer Prices Index, which measures changes in the prices of the goods and services bought by households, was unchanged in the year to February 2015, down from 0.3% in the year to January.

This means that a basket of goods and services that cost £100.00 in February 2014 would have still cost £100.00 in February 2015. While some prices (such as for motor fuels and food) are lower than they were a year ago, others (such as for clothing and rents) are higher. Prices of motor fuels and food have now fallen or remained unchanged on the year for 18 and 10 consecutive months respectively and in February, the 12-month rates for both groups were the lowest on record. Taken together, motor fuels and food price changes reduced the CPI 12-month rate by approximately 0.9 percentage points in the year to February.

The slowdown in the 12-month rate between January and February came from price movements for a range of recreational goods (particularly data processing equipment, books and games, toys and hobbies), food and furniture and furnishings.

The core inflation rate – the rate of inflation excluding goods with volatile price movements, notably energy, food, alcohol and tobacco – was 1.2% in February, 1.2 percentage points higher than overall inflation. As in most recent months, this indicates that most of the downward pull on inflation has come from price movements for goods excluded from the core calculation, notably motor fuel and food.

I'm from the UK, but I have been a fan of the Pats for about 14/15 years now.

I imagine as a US fan, the idea of the promotion and relegation between leagues is probably fairly alien, and there is no playoffs of any kind in the Premier League, with the regular season the be all and end all.
The Premier League is obviously the biggest league here in the UK, but we have the Championship below it, then League 1, League 2 (where Portsmouth currently reside) and a bunch of lower leagues.

3 teams are relegated out of divisions and 3 promoted each season. Usually its the top 2 that go up automatically and then the 3rd is decided using playoffs of 4 teams (they play a game home and away in a semi final and then the winners play a single game to decide the winner at the national stadium at Wembley).

Our team is renowned at recently for our excellent academy that has put out some of the best young players in Europe over the last 10 years. Luke Shaw (Manchester United and England), Gareth Bale (Real Madrid and Wales), Theo Walcott (Arsenal and England) and Alex Oxlaide-Chamberlain (Arsenal and England) being a few of the best from recent years.

We've been driven by an excellent core of young English players and our really strong midfield in the last few years. Our defence is pretty strong as well

null,false,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,null,"Well, first off, I think we have to reluctantly accept the fact that Manchester United were simply the better team and wanted it more. We were outplayed and outcoached.

Does that mean our squad is terrible? No, not necessarily. Does that mean Rodgers is shit? No, not necessarily.

Fact is, our key players are still quite young. And as talented as they are, their youth and inexperience makes them hesitant to a certain extent, hesitant to *assert* themselves.

I know it's not the most satisfying answer because we expect so much from these ultra-talented players who are paid millions to play a game... but they are still human.

* Coutinho is only 22-years-old - And don't underestimate him; In spite of his size, he has a bit of a temper and is quite firey. But he is also young, playing for a massive club in a foreign country, adjusting to a culture so different from what he knows, where one mistake (big or small) can result in brutal criticism from the English press. A lesson he learned from Luis Suarez.
* Jordan Henderson is only 24-years-old, has so much to prove, still has so much to *improve* but he is already being hailed as the successor to a legend like Steven Gerrard while Gerrard is still at the club. Henderson possesses that quintessential English respect and politeness... How does Henderson create his own identity and his assert his leadership under the shadow of the giant Gerrard? Not easy for a 24-year-old kid still learning his trade. But look at Henderson's anger and passion when he scuffs a shot, or when he or a teammate scores a goal.
* As for Joe Allen... well... I don't see him as a source of aggression but any footballer does not get to where he did without some sort of pride and grit.

If anything, our lack of ""aggression"" in our squad versus United did not show that our players *lacked* aggression but, rather, it showed the *youth* and *inexperience* of our players.

But as disappointing as this season may be (or could be; after all, it's not over until it is over), I take heart in the fact that missing the title last season (you don't think Henderson thinks about that red card every day?) and this disappointed loss to United actually is a good thing, it keeps them humble, and keeps them hungry.

I see fire in the eyes of Coutinho, Henderson, Sterling, etc. But perhaps they do not know how to harness that fire. But when they do (and I believe they will) ... watch out.

True character is not defined by how you handle success; True character is defined by how you bounce back from disappointment.

That discovery may not happen next Premier League match, or this season, but I think it will happen soon.

And as frustrating as Brendan Rodgers can be, do you know why I like him? It's because I believe he feels the way I do: Footballers are not machines, they are humans.

And if you instill belief and confidence, and if you develop the man and the character, you can get the bad player to do average things, you can get the average player to do good things, you can get the good player to do great things, and you can get the great players to do legendary things.

And I believe we have some great players.

This season may have been not what we hoped it would be... but I certainly expect some great things in 2015-16.

And if that doesn't happen, well, we can always sack Rodgers, right? ;)",null,0,null,1427192694,null,0,false,0,cpoy6lt,null,t3_30113n,null,t1_cpoy6lt,null,t3_30113n,null,null,null,1431982358,null,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null

I'm glad to see that 11 MPs of the Coalition have sufficent integrity to stand tall.  

Here's what I think, please take what you liked and leave the rest.  Politicians will lie, politicians will play the game, politicians will feather their own nest.  I accept that they will get paid perhaps more than their worth; I'm realistic about what they will and won't do -- ""Yes Minister"" and ""Yes Prime Minister"" are a fairly succinct evaluation of what happens in the corridors of power, and it's important for us not to expect the impossible.

There is, however, a line you don't cross.  You don't condone murder (and I don't mean killing terrorists in Gibralter etc., I MEAN MURDER); and you don't protect pedophiles.  

If a politician bangs a prostitute in paid-for-consensual sex, I'm not exactly delighted, but if he does his job and tries to be a quasi-decent person, I'm willing to reluctantly accept it.  But if a politician rapes a child, and if another politician protects a rapist?  If they don't get called to account, we live under Oligarchs.  My grandfather died preventing that from happening.

A rapist of children has no rights to power whatsoever.  One who protects that kind of person is equally vile.  I don't say they both deserve to be treated in an undignified fashion -- but they need to be put in a place where they may be excluded from society and out of harms way, for their sake and for ours.

That place is prison.  

If these individuals are not in prison, then children are not protected from abuse.  This is not acceptable.

Hopefully Theresa May is genuine about her intent to address these heinous crimes.  [Pertinent link.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-g_RgF-HJwU)

3) Strikers is somewhat of a problem as well. Sturridge is quality, yet injury prone, Sterling isn't that good at finishing, Mario works better in a 2 man system, Lambert is an old man and Borini is decent at best.

The FA will never ever satisfactorily investigate any situation and I don't expect them to.

Even if Rooney was investigated and punished to the degree that we'd like him to be punished, it will not change the fact that we lost. And even if we got the ""revenge"" of Rooney being punished, I would still feel empty about it.

Fact is, we lost. We were outplayed, we were outcoached. Simple as that.

I'm not happy with the result.

But it's over now and I won't quibble about who should be punished or not. Frankly, I won't ever trust the FA to ever get it right so why bother?

Yup if a straight man asked for a cake with that slogan for that cause for that event he would also have been refused.

That's irrelevant really, the company wouldn't risk their reputation letting the CI bribe them.

Things like offshore wind, high compression nuclear and tidal lagoons have an inherent cost due to the huge engineering required. Solar is made up of small, static, solid state units, it's much more of a pure knowledge based device - and those units have been reducing in cost by 8% a year for forty years (a halving every ten years) and will probably continue reducing its costs for a long time yet. To put that in context, Britain has a level of sun power which is about half that in California or Australia, so the difference between the two is currently being subsumed each decade by advances in technology. Solar electricity in Britain is currently about double the grid retail price, so it definitely is worth plugging on with, alongside other options.

The other benefit is that it is highly scalable. For instance, various investment banks are saying that a system with solar and a battery to smooth out daily variations will be cheaper than grid electricity in various countries by 2020, and in Britain by 2030.

null,false,Miserygut,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,null,"&gt;I do think that the UK &amp; USA have been far more active in their fiscal and monetary policy which means they are unlikely to suffer for quite so long as Japan.

The UK &amp; USA are copying what Japan did move-for-move. We know how this story ends. Every time the Japanese economy makes an effort to recover they dump more liquidity into the market and scupper it. Richard Koo has written extensively on the topic of Japan's lacklustre economic performance since the crash. All the BoJ do is ignore him and every time he's been proven right. His comments on their current efforts are pretty dim.

The key phrase here is 'Balance Sheet Recession'. British companies and individuals have a *lot* of debt they need to pay off and lack the means to do so in any immediate sense. This in turn means that the recovery will be at best protracted and at worst a generation-long bumble of stagnation. We've pumped the debt well dry with near-zero interest rates and clever financial instruments wrapping up the same turds over and over. 

There are three ways forward from here:

* The recession happens and we let growth slide for a bit as debt levels normalise. Interest rates will stay low during this period but return to more historical norms (3 - 5%).

* The recession happens and politicians furiously intervene by dumping more and more credit into the economy to try and kick start a boom again. Instead we end up with deflation and inflated asset prices for an even longer period of time, fuelling more bullshit all around the globe like the essentially free lending the Japanese offered.

* The recession doesn't happen but we have a long period of stagnation (with or without inflation given current money supply numbers). The debt can is kicked further and further down the road until an external shock rocks the economy and repayments falter. Then we have a shitstorm of enormous bad debt and an inability to pay.

Right now there is no reason for the investment and banking industry to change it's tune. Governments will bail out their failures which means the risk profile for these investments are askew. Until the government says that they specifically will not bail out these failures and the bank's creditors are liable for the losses, we won't see any change in behaviour. Again, deliberate inaction from the government is going to cause a crisis.

There's nothing wrong with ""Slow and steady"" when it comes to the economy.

Edit: I should say that the economy we have now, in terms of credit, is practically unknown. Humanity has never been here before. There hasn't been a fiat current which lasted successfully longer than a few decades before.

Please note, the following are possible justifications within the framework of morality at the DWP, and not indicative of my own reasoning. I might be a bit weird, but I'm not a heartless cunt:

&gt;Man who missed appointment due to being at hospital with his partner, who had just had a stillborn child.

It is the responsibility of all claimants to attend the Job Centre Plus as and when required. Where this Gentleman in gainful employment, he'd have been expected to ring his employer to inform them he'd be unable to attend work that day. The same, therefore, applies to appointments at the Job Centre.

&gt;Man sanctioned for missing an appointment at the jobcentre on the day of his brother’s unexpected death. He had tried to phone Jobcentre Plus to explain, but could not get through and left a message which was consequently not relayed to the appropriate person.

It is the responsibility of the claimant to ensure a continuous and open dialogue with the Job Centre Plus, and any and all advisers they might see whilst actively seeking work. The claimant in this instance should have followed up the phone call with an email.

&gt;Man who carried out 60 job searches but missed one which matched his profile.

It is the responsibility of the claimant to ensure they apply for any - *and all* - vacancies for which they are demonstrably suited for.

**At this point I'd imagine some bullshit about how wonderfully magnificent Universal Jobmatch is at matching claimants to jobs. Unfortunately my profundity of Government bullshit isn't upto the standards required to generate such guffins.**

&gt;Man had an appointment at the jobcentre on the Tuesday, was taken to hospital with a suspected heart attack that day, missed the appointment and was sanctioned for nine weeks.

Claimants must notify the Job Centre without delay, any changes in their circumstances. This claimant should have done so, and duly been considered for ESA.

I could go on, but I'm sure the point is proven. These sanctions are, alas, indicative of one of the central problems with the way the ""Welfare state"" is administered - it's viewed as a body politic, where one set of abject rules and regulations absolutely positively *must* be applied to all who fall under it, regardless.

I think the biggest problem is youth, inexperience and unfamiliarity.

Sure, we can solve the issue of youth and inexperience with a veteran player ... but that doesn't solve the problem of unfamiliarity. Unfamiliarity with a new coach with new tactics and new training habits, a new city, a new team, new people, new supporters, new expectations, sometimes a new language and an entirely new culture. And, of course, the natural pressure of wanting to succeed and impress.

It's frustrating for me because the natural talent is obvious but it's just not coming together as nicely or as quickly as I would like.

So it's easy to treat a squad like a machine: This part doesn't work; Replace it with this better part.

But it's not quite like that.

Think of it in your own lives whether you're at uni or working out there in the world and imagine if your professor or your classmates or your boss treated you as coldly as we do footballers: You lack the aggression, you're just not good enough, why not bring in that other person for the job, why aren't you succeeding when the best of the best are thrown together?

Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson collaborated together on songs and it resulted in some of the most cringe-worthy stuff I have ever heard. But that pub band was pretty fucking good wasn't it?

I guess what I'm saying is that, yes, we definitely have to keep adding/subtracting but we also have to be patient as well.

Real Madrid can spend fuck-tons of money and, yet, they are not guaranteed to win everything ever year.

But look at Barcelona and the Spanish national team... Sure, they had quality. But the fact that they operated as one, as a unit, is what gave them sustained success.

And this is where I like Brendan Rodgers' philosophy. He's not simply trying to get the statistically best player out there but, rather, he is trying to get the player that works best for the *team*.

And creating a cohesive unit is what will result in sustained, long-term success.

null,false,boardsandbikes,null,null,null,"1) Ibe isn't a fullback. At all. And he shouldn't be, and he shouldn't be turned into one. Personally I think we need another RB and LB, as Manquillo and Flanagan are both very young, Enrique is unfortunately not up to scratch/constantly injured, and Moreno is too young as well. I've said it previously, I'd love Daryl Janmaat from Newcastle as our first choice RB (and he's played as a wingback for the dutch national team), and Fabio Coentrao as a left back. Our fullback situation would then be Manquillo, Moreno, Coentrao, Janmaat, Flanagan; all of whom are more than capable. Wisdom I think should be played at CB or not at all IMO.

2) Lucas should stay, and should be our first choice DM, but only if we play with 3 in midfield...if we only play with two CM's I think we can get passed through too easily. The same with Can. Can isn't quite mobile enough to play in a two, though he hasn't played with Hendo in that role yet. Gonalons would be a good buy, Bender has had a terrible year, Song has dropped off since the start of the season (as he tends to do) and Fer isn't good enough. Lucas, Can and Gonalons would be more than enough. However if we do go back to playing with 3 in midfield I think it's more important to look at creative midfielders as we've only got Allen and Hendo playing that role. Pjanic would of course be the dream, Gundogan would be great or Lars Bender.

3) Our strikeforce next year IMO should be Sturridge, Balotelli, Lambert, Origi, new striker. Sturridge just needs a bit more time, Balotelli I would be loathe to chuck out unless we got an outrageous offer, if Lambert is happy with his minutes I'd love to see him retire at Liverpool and I WANT BORINI GONE. He's not good enough, he's never going to be good enough and it drives me up the wall that we can't get rid of him. Origi I wouldn't be surprised to see on loan at another Premier League club next season, depending on how preseason goes for him.

Your argument is a fallacy though: that is very obviously discrimination against sexual orientation. Your business absolutely, without a shadow of a doubt, has the right to refuse produce a product that incites hatred/discrimination.

A Christian bakery has the right to refuse someone requesting ""God hates fags"" cake for instance.

The problem, and the grey area, is when the message is NOT one of hatred/discrimination. Where is the line drawn? It seems like an area that hasn't been explored all that well in regards to law.

Otherwise, onshore wind is cheap but unpopular, offshore wind is expensive but as you say uses the massive untapped resource of the coastline, and is also relatively reliable. The two together are already producing about 12% of UK electricity.

Another possibility in using the coastline is water source heat pumps. I don't know much about it, but there was this article a week or two back about a scheme in Norway, installed by a company from Glasgow:

If a white man had asked for a cake promoting interracial marriage, and been refused, they'd have broken equality legislation on racial grounds. Same thing.

&gt;That's irrelevant really, the company wouldn't risk their reputation letting the CI bribe them.

Not bribed to produce a false result, no. But paid for the survey they wanted, asking questions that drew false equivalencies. If the questions were about service providers refusing to provide service to people on racial grounds, or access for disabled people, then they'd be equivalent. 

&gt;It's not actually, your only complaint is that Ashers is made out to be discriminated against and in my and 70% of the countries opinion they were. 

I already explained how it was. 

&gt;Did you actually read those passages or is that just copypaste from some website? Because they're all okay with divorce...btw i'm assuming that since you only linked passages about divorce you're now aware that the rest of what you said isn't true?

Do you resort to patronising people as soon as you're wrong. They're from the Bible, which most people with a passing knowledge of Christianity have a copy of handy. 

'What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.'

Quoted directly after the marriage event itself at a wedding. Not ok with divorce.

'And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery.' (compare 'Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother.' from the same passage.) According to Jesus, divorce and remarriage is adultery. Not ok with divorce.

'But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.'

Anyone marrying a divorced woman commits adultery.

etc etc. Not going to go through all of them just to point out exactly where you're wrong; you've claimed that they're all ok with divorce, which they're not, further, my point was about marrying divorcees which is explicitly forbidden. Go look the rest up if you're concerned.

And btw, you condescending twat:

'Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel.'

So get to fuck. Go learn your own doctrine before you start talking down to people who actually do know it. Or should I say, 'Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye...'

It in effect enables employers to operate as a cartel in terms of knowing what their competitors offer and would be illegal at any other financial level above NMW (and rightly so).

Stop being pedantic. You know they don't think that. Britain isn't just an island in the North Pacific. It's a form of Government. an Idea. A history and a future. Those people are a part of our history and our ideals, they are democratic and willing to stand up to countries who would bully them. 

&gt;So you think that if a group of Argentinians moved to St. Kilda, St. Kilda would become part of Argentina?

If there was a vote on St. Kilda for them to become a part of Argentina and they won by a  majority then, I'm afraid that they would be a part of Argentina. But then that becomes a discussion on whether an island could secede from the U.K the same way Scotland did. Like I said though, if that's what they wanted then that's what they want. 

&gt;No, they shouldn't have to move, they should accept they are living in Argentina.

Are you trying to argue that they live in the South American Plateau or whether they should accept the rule of the Argentinian Government. If the Former then no one is arguing that. If the latter then no. They have no connection to the people of Argentina, they have no history with the people of Argentina.

No, It's 400km from Argentina.  By that logic, the UK should be claiming France and most of the low countries.

See above.  

&gt;Why don't we just get 5 million British people together, ship them over to Ireland, then hold a referendum to decide whether Ireland wants to rejoin the union? That sounds like self determination to me.

Strawman.  The islanders have been there for nearly 200 years, we didn't just 'ship them over'.

&gt;Why not ask everyone in Argentina whether they want part of Argentina to be ruled by Britain? Carving countries up to have an artificial majority isn't ""self determination""

&gt; Oh, that's a shame.

Yeah, it kind of is, but most modern films and TV are essentially broken for me. I've largely given up trying but on the occasions I sit down in front of something or other I often end up ragequitting after about five minutes because it just seems so infantile.

Why? Well, if I had the time and the inclination I could write several thousand words on it, but the gist is that modern productions leave nothing to the imagination and dare not rely on narrative when there is so much shiny CGI and sound FX and so on, and so often I end up feeling patronised.

A case in point: One of my all time favourite films is the old Alan Ladd western, [*Shane*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_(film\)). Hardly anyone who watches it gets to the end without asking ""So, does he die?"" It's an emotional conclusion to a really clear and strong narrative progression, and it's driven by the script alone. It's irrelevant that the question goes unanswered, and there's not yet any way that technical FX and post-pro can engineer that kind of emotional response and sympathy for the lead role.

There's also support for training and certification quite heavily - we are the most certified company in europe in what we do (percentage wise), and the company is eager to maintain that. My first major one is coming up soon, need to start studying for it!

There's downtime between projects (ie, right now im waiting for clients to decide things, so i have a few days to whatever - i can dick around on reddit, play with some technology, do some studying etc).

There's the chance for work travel (depending on the client) - ie, one of the guys that I work with is in the US for a few months, some of the others are going to geneva a few days a week etc. That's pretty cool.

Besides, the Argentine air force would really be stretching it in terms of range with the SU-24 much like they were in the war. The combat range with a good load out for an SU-24 is a fair bit less than the distance from the closest Argentine airport to the most westerly tip of the Falklands. Sure, they could carry less and fly at cruise altitude (rather than low to avoid detection) but then they're going run into all sorts of problems with our AEW aircraft and our Type 45s.

EDIT: Yeah- basically the fear of white British in the UK is that immigrants or even established non-indigenous communities will not integrate and take on 'the British way of life' (whatever that this). So segregation and separateness is the fear. Interracial relationships totally show that individuals ARE integrated. So that's not gonna be an issue that British people think about very much.

Is Flanno dead? I haven't heard anything in so long about him.  He's going to be rusty as hell when/if he does come back, and he looked so promising last season. A bit rough around the edges but a solid back.  

Tactics wise, we need to stop with the high long balls.  We don't have the height or the numbers up top to win them or take advantage of the 50/50 balls.  We need to continue using Coutino and Henderson's creativity with through balls which means people need to make more runs in.  The number of times I see Cout or Hendo on the ball and Sterling, Lallana, and Sturridge are just standing their watching is embarrassing.

This is basically the central argument. That we are at such a high amount of interest eliminates the argument for low interest debt.

Imo the NHS and pensions budgets should be slightly cut along with other departments, there's this weird sense that both are completely immune to any cuts or any criticism. I know cutting the NHS is see as such a taboo but look at the budget yourself and see how much is spent. In my opinion cuts should be across the board instead of everything except pensions/healthcare.

My position is quite moderate though, I'm not saying make cuts on ideological grounds or to cut everything to the bone for the sake of clearing debt earlier. We should merely seek to reduce our debt over the long term to a low level.

The one thing I abhor in these kind of debates is a generally left leaning view that we can just spend, spend, spend our way into an economy, racking up endless debt. I wouldn't be opposed if these were not the same people who will then in the good times constantly cry out for increased spending on welfare, health, education, pensions and all the things under the sun. The real issue with the last government is that during a time of economic growth they increased the debt. This is the reason why Labour are blamed, because they increased the debt in the good times. It's not because of the economic crash.

Disabled people yes, racial grounds no. The question does however have an example of a lesbian couple refusing the exact same thing in reverse but more people are actually against taking that to court than this.

&gt;They're from the Bible, which most people with a passing knowledge of Christianity have a copy of handy.

Yup and if you read the entirety of the very first passage you linked originally you'll see that divorce is acceptable if either party is unfaithful to their wedding vows. So it is okay. 

&gt;'Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel.'

Again if you actually read the whole thing you'll know that passage is telling you to let beauty come form within and from your deeds, not from vanity. Basically be nice rather than look nice.

&gt;Go learn your own doctrine before you start talking down to people who actually do know it.

Since there's about 3000 people on the island, this works out as about £100,000 per resident per year. You can marginally increase this because it isn't clear that the Falklands is as productive on a per capita basis as (say) the city of London, but marginally decrease it because the government also pays a bit for the defence spending of mainland-based Brits - £100,000 is probably a good order-of-magnitude estimate.

£100,000 is quite a lot of money, but it is a lot less than the government spends trying long-shot treatments for some kinds of terminal cancer, so it is not like the government will never spend that sort of money to make a political point with no strong economic case. It also buys us a huge reduction in defence spending to defend our other overseas territories - by proving we'd go absolutely beserk and spend way over the odds to defend one overseas territory, other countries are less likely to sabre-rattle elsewhere. I don't know whether the £200m we spend each year results in a net reduction or increase in defence spending, but I could easily believe it pays for itself.

The Palmer paper is specifically about the extra energy and economic costs when solar gets to high penetrations, in the range of 20-45%. First, this is not relevant to discussing the costs when we're talking about 'perhaps 4% in a decade', because the grid-balancing mechanisms which would be necessary are completely different. Second, *you cannot in any way say ""the EROI is 15 years in Australia, so it will be 30 years in the UK, because we get half the insolation they do""* because most of the extra costs they are talking about are not embedded in the panel itself, but in the ancillary mechanisms necessary to balance the grid, which will vary according to the energy output of the solar installations, and not the number of panels necessary to get that energy output.

The Prieto-Hall paper is really odd - his basic idea is to to divide the GDP of Spain by its total energy use, and get out a figure for energy per Euro, and then multiply this ratio by the monetary costs of solar. For instance, administration costs  32 million Euros, so you can multiply to get out 55 GWh equivalent, Electrical network restructuring costs 45 million Euros, or 77 GWh equiavlent, taxes cost 7 million Euros, or 12 GWh equivalent etc. This is just a very strange methodology.

Full back position will be a massive deal once Glen Johnson goes (free's up a lot of wages) and then comes the problem, are we continuing to play 3-4-3? and if that's the case do we look towards more of a wing-back or full-back? If it's a full back, you may see what has happened to Javier Manq happen, started the season pretty well, but as the formation has been tweak, we haven't seen him because he doesn't fit the style of play (so be it, still very young and could adapt). So, this is a very tough choice and one, I think will be one of Liverpool's biggest problems come the transfer window. Maybe Dani Alves for a season?

2. Liverpool have struggled for an ""enforcer"" for a number of years now. I really like Lucas, and he actually does win most of his battles and headed duels. I do believe though that this may not be an area of focus for Brendan Rodgers and he'll opt to sign maybe a ball playing defender and go with Can being our ""hard man"". 

3. I don't really have much to say apart from biggest concern. Biggest concern in, we have no other option after Sturridge. Balotelli is great, I just don't believe he fits the Rodgers way. I think one or two forwards will be brought in, in the summer. 

4.

UKIP - Policies are reactionary, will alienate the UK's place in the world. They are getting very close to being a nationalist party. They change their policies so much nobody really knows what exactly they stand for apart from hard euroscepticism 

Tories - Split down the middle, they don't know who they want to be at the moment. Too obsessed with privatisation of industries and protecting big business. They don't do enough to get tax dodging down to a minimum, they seem to want to make young people pay for the older generation (who votes for them) 

Labour-  Policies not left wing anymore. Most are very similar to the tories to be honest. Ed Balls has no idea what if anything he will do differently. They don't propose nationalisation of the railways and utilities (We buy our water from a Chinese owned company now)

Greens -  Used to like them but a lot of their policies are just unimplementable I am afraid or a bit silly. Their justice policies, military policies etc. are unfeasible. Their ideas for a living wage aren't backed up with maths to show they work etc.

You don't have to rack up debt though. You just have to ensure that all money that is due is collected and I think that is the problem most people have.  Cuts are being made across the board on public services, reducing the resources people have to fuel the economy*, whilst a lot of people and business are getting away with paying next to no tax.

*Because you need money to go around for people to spend for the economy to grow, cut public sector jobs, wages etc and people have less money (as well as less services) to be able to buy things. People stop buying things, and that affects the private sector and so on and so forth. That's why spending is important.

I have no problem with there being some cuts if needed, however when those cuts are being made and large businesses and ridiculously rich people are just running away from their responsibilities as tax payers that's why everyone is bitter.  I wouldn't even mind paying a little more in tax myself if it helped improve public services and the economy to boot, but we've all just got a tax cut, so that's going to be less money to spend on public services again next budget ... and we'll be going back around in this circle again ",null,0,null,1427202422,null,0,false,0,cpp0zl4,null,t3_3047jv,null,t1_cpp0zl4,null,t1_cpp08zj,null,null,null,1431983681,null,5,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,5,null

The Nootka Sound Conventions?  Those are disputed by both the UK and Argentina.  I'll copypasta from the Wikipedia article:

&gt;The Nootka Sound Conventions

&gt; In 1789, both the United Kingdom and Spain attempted settlement in the Nootka Sound, on Vancouver Island. On 25 October 1790, these two Kingdoms approved the Nootka Sound Convention. The Conventions included provisions recognising that the coasts and islands of South America colonised by Spain at the time were Spanish, and that areas south of the southernmost settlements were off limits to both countries, provided (in a secret article) that no third party settled there either. The conventions were unilaterally repudiated by Spain in 1795 but implicitly revived by the Treaty of Madrid[disambiguation needed] in 1814.

&gt;The sixth article of the convention states:
It is further agreed with respect to the eastern and western coasts of South America and the islands adjacent, that the respective subjects shall not form in the future any establishment on the parts of the coast situated to the south of the parts of the same coast and of the islands adjacent already occupied by Spain; it being understood that the said respective subjects shall retain the liberty of landing on the coasts and islands so situated for objects connected with their fishery and of erecting thereon huts and other temporary structures serving only those objects.

&gt;Whether or not this affected sovereignty over the islands is disputed. **The British argue that the agreement did not affect the respective claims and only stipulated that neither party would make further establishments on the coasts or ""adjacent"" islands already held by Spain. Argentina argues that ""the islands adjacent"" includes the Falklands and that Britain renounced any claim by the agreements.**

&gt;until 1833 when it was retaken by force by the British.

From [the same article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falkland_Islands_sovereignty_dispute#Argentine_settlements):

&gt;On 2 January 1833, Captain John Onslow arrived and **delivered written requests that Pinedo lower the Argentine flag in favour of the British one**, and that the Argentine administration leave the islands. Pinedo asked if war had been declared between Argentina and Great Britain; Onslow replied that it had not. Nonetheless, Pinedo, heavily outmanned and outgunned, left the islands under protest, with the Argentine flag being lowered by British officers and delivered to him. **Argentines subsequently claimed that the population of Puerto Luis was expelled at the same time, though sources from the time dispute this, suggesting that the colonists were encouraged to remain under Vernet's deputy, Matthew Brisbane. It is also documented that at least 27 members of Vernet's colony were still in residence in the islands in July 1833.** Back on the mainland, Pinedo faced court martial; he was suspended for four months and transferred to the army, though he was recalled to the navy in 1845.

This advice is probably too late for you. My advice would be to sort out any issues with the card but keep it. 

If you have a monthly charge that you must pay every month and can do so by credit card then use the card for that. Then call Aqua and setup a Direct Debit for the entire balance of the card. So X out and X back in every month will stop interest charges. Your job is then to make sure that there is enough money in your bank account to ensure that DD is fulfilled.

When your credit score is better, you will be able to apply for better cards, such as a Barclaycard.

They would cost far more than the monarchy currently does, they would divide the nation and diminish our relationships with the rest of the commonwealth. For me the monarchy works well, it serves it's purpose and serves as a good reminder of our islands rich history. The Queen is a constant in an ever changing world and the monarchy itself is an institution I feel is worth keeping. There are plenty of honours available to recognise our best and brightest without having to completely change our national identity in the process. 

A bigger priority for me would be the balance of power at Westminster. When the SNP can poll at 3% of the vote and stand to win 8% of the seats, where as UKIP stand to win maybe 1 or 2 seats with 10% of the vote. If you think the monarchy is the biggest barrier to a fair democracy in the UK then you need to look at some of the ridiculous figures that result from FPTP, and that doesn't even begin to address the issue of small constituencies in Wales, or the so called West Lothian question.

Matthew 19:9 clearly states that marrying the divorced party is adultery. 1 Corinthians 7:12-15 gives permission to separate, not divorce, much less remarry.

Try getting remarried in the Catholic church as a divorcee. Good luck!

&gt;Every divorce is a result of sin, either on the part of one spouse or both. Does God forgive divorce? Absolutely. Divorce is no less forgivable than any other sin. Forgiveness of all sins is available through faith in Jesus Christ (Matthew 26:28; Ephesians 1:7).

Oh, this is priceless. You, who accused me of copying from some website when I quoted scripture at you, have lifted this wholesale, word-for-word, from http://www.gotquestions.org/divorced-remarry.html

That doesn't mean we have to hate each-other for it.

Picking a random paragraph:

&gt;In the immediate aftermath of the enlargement in 2004, Britain’s new EU allies helped the UK find its feet in the EU after the bitter split with France and Germany over the Iraq war the year before. Britain had been isolated in its support for the Iraq invasion among the 15 members of the EU at the time of the war. But the arrival in 2004 of the Atlanticist new member states – referred to as “new Europe” by the US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld – evened the balance. The diplomatic benefits were clear. But all was not well on the home front.

Yeah, the whole article is like that.  To my taste that's dull and tedious writing, but perhaps others disagree.  

Contrast this article with [this piece](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/01/does-immigration-harm-working-americans/384060/) I picked at random in the Atlantic, an American magazine.  Sample:

&gt;So there you have it. Experts say it’s impossible. Can’t be happening. And if actual observed data from the real economy seem to suggest that the impossible is happening—well, Albert Einstein himself answered that one. If the material universe doesn’t support the theory: “Then I’d feel sorry for the good Lord. The theory is correct.""

&gt;Before deciding whom to trust on this issue, the economists or your lying eyes, it helps to understand how the economists reached their conclusion.

&gt;Since the time of Adam Smith, economists have agreed that the secret of economic growth is specialization. Rather than everyone baking his or her own bread and sewing his or her own clothes, everyone chooses one occupation and then trades for the products others make. The more individuals specialize, the more productive everyone becomes. The more people trade, the more widely the benefits of productivity are shared.

This is the hardest part of being a lefty and an accountant and (amateur) economist. 

I want us to start from generally leftish principles of helping those in need, providing a safety net (and I really don't care if the cost of that safety net for everyone else is some people chosing it as a way of life), great education, infrastructure... I am ""of the left"" on most things. 

I want these things paid for by progressive taxation at higher levels than they currently are (under Thatcher tax take was around 40% of GDP, now it's nearer 35%). 

I want those of us on the left who want these things, and accept the Keynsian response to crisis to scream bloody murder every time we are in the up-swing of the economic cycle and we do tax cuts and stupid spending (eg the child trust fund) instead of paying off the debt (or investing in sovereign wealth funds as paying off early can carry penalties on some instruments) for the next time the shit hits the fan. 

There are *two sides* to Keynes. Use both. 

There is an argument to be made that if the returns on investments funded through national debt exceed the cost of the debt we should borrow anyway. It's a perfectly sensible argument, but it can't be a return to the economy as a whole (which is how it is almost always phrased), it has to be a return to the treasury. 

One of the key reasons I support PR is that it reduces the wild swings from left to right, and the inherent costs involved in that. Calitions mean compromise (and I believe this coalition government has been better than a straight Con win would have been).

Well try this situation which is the same thing which is based on a real story. A small company (an individual) which happens to be a B&amp;B. Somebody phones them up and books a room to stay in for 1-2 nights.

When the person turned up to stay the owner of the B&amp;B turned them away. For the simple reason the person happened to be a well known sex offender who used to work at the school in the area and was well known. The owner of the B&amp;B recognised the person instantly and just said ""No way""

So based on what is happening in the cake issue. The above would also be discrimination and the B&amp;B could be taken to court?

No matter what it. It Is important for the right of a small business to have the right to refuse the service regardless of the reason why because other situations like the one above will occur.

Far more important thing required is major reform of the financial services sector which has not happened. Does mean a complete relook at regulation with whole financial system. And fixing the underlaying problems with the UK economy which have still not been fixed. 

Financial system is so powerful that needs to be clearer even the average person can understand financial products on offer. Does mean tax reform from the bottom up so that only a couple of people can't set the rules and avoid paying tax. 
Government spending is a transfer of wealth and does not cost us anything in reality. 

Reason why the debate has been hijakced is because they don't relate to real life and most people can't work out how they impact them.  Debt has always resulted in default if it becomes to big or is reduced in size the fact we have not done that but cut spending should tell you something.  Germany after WW2 had restructure of debt or default or whatever you want to call it. 

UK does need reform when it comes to spending mainly making it more local and fairer.  Does mean complete reform of the welfare system from the bottom up.  Instead we tried to fix the system with some minor measures which did nothing in reality or very little to fix the core problem.  Notice a trend UK kicks the can down the road when it comes to policy doing small minor fixes over fixing the core problem which caused it.

&gt;To understand why these advocates are so hurt and angry, you have to understand the meandering road immigration reform has taken over the course of the last decade—a road littered with false starts, broken promises, and a community repeatedly left in the lurch. Latinos feel that they have been jerked around by politicians who alternately pander for their votes and shunt them aside when their priorities become inconvenient—like now. Obama in particular has made a series of pledges on immigration, only to abandon them all. Now, when the president says he still plans to act—just give him a couple of months—reformers don’t know whether to trust him.

&gt;""What next?"" said Frank Sharry, head of America's Voice, who has worked for immigration reform for decades. ""Obama makes another promise? It turns out that other justifications for delay emerge post-election?""

To my ears, this is immeasurably more compelling writing.  It actually makes the reader care about the issue being discussed and explains what's at stake, whereas the Guardian's piece just washes over me with endless paragraphs discussing party politics of little interest to anyone who's not a political junkie.

I mean, just look at the opening paragraph of the Guardian piece:

&gt;As holder of the ancient post of lord chancellor, responsible for courts and judges across the land, Derry Irvine had a knack for shutting down irritating interventions from his colleagues. During his time in office, from 1997 to 2003, Irvine’s fearsome reputation preceded him. Minor functionaries and even cabinet ministers would cower when the lord chancellor, who once compared himself to his 16th-century predecessor Cardinal Wolsey, felt they had not mastered their briefs.

Who cares?  And *why* should we care?  Do people find the life of Derry Irvine of particular interest?  I don't think so.

On top of that, defence of the realm shouldn't be something you need to 'justify'. It should just be done. If there is a rising threat in the South Atlantic (and there is, with Argentina and Russia doing dealings), then we need to react.

We made an international obligation to at least 2% of GDP on defence, and the fact that no party wants to meet that target tells me I shouldn't trust any of them, no matter how many giveaways they offer. I hold defence as one of the most important things a government can offer its peoples, and the fact that even in attacking ISIS we're claiming that 6% of total strikes is somehow something to be proud of is disgusting.

And to those who will claim we shouldn't invest in defence because we're only a small country, that's exactly why we should invest. We're the 5th largest economy on the planet, out of over 200. If we don't take a 'leading role' (all that means is to play our part) then we truly hold no influence at all and that we'd rather have other country's men and woman dying so we don't have to, for wars we involve **ourselves** in.

He's nowhere near the level that he was at during his prime, he's a completely different player now to be fair but thats what happens. But I wouldn't say his best years were from 2005-2009. 

As a Liverpool supporter, I've enjoyed watching this guy grow from a rough tackling midfielder and utility player to the heart of this club. It's been pretty special to watch, all the goals, that one against Southampton that came in off the bar, the ones against United, that screamer from the edge of the box against Everton, the one in the UEFA cup final. All of these were before he was even captain! 

Let's not forget that freekick against Portsmouth, the Newcastle belter of a shot from a freekick again, the chip over Given after Lucas played him in. He's given me so many memories I'll cherish forever, just moments. These don't even include Istanbul and Cardiff. 

Anyone remember that weird Bergkamp-esque swivel in the box against Newcastle one where he then plays a short quick ball into a tiny bit of space with the perfect pace on it for someone to get to. It's stuff like that I'll remember, or that crunching slide tackle when running back from the opposing half against Southampton as well I'm pretty sure 2004/05. 

He's given us all so many many memories (fuck me that Boro volley past our very own Brad Jones!) 

Something like this won't even come close to tarnishing his reputation, people will remember it but as soon as the past fades and time goes on you keep the memories that brought you joy and happiness. And we'll remember Gerrard for all the epic things (holy crap haven't even mentioned the Olympiakos volley). 

It may be hard to see right now under all the dust of the sending off etc but watch in 10 years time people will remember him as a God of football.

The 4-3-3 system worked for us in the last few months but we are only playing it because we don't have the players to play BR's preferred system.

This is how we should line up next season.

Can could probably cover both full back slots but I can't see him as a CB in a back four. For RB we should go for Nathaniel Clyne, he'd be expensive but worth it. Not sure about LB, Moreno should be first choice but he needs to improve his defending a lot. DM is a tough one but crucial for this system. We should raid Southampton again and get Wanyama. For striker, my first choice would be Dybala but we've also been linked with Vietto who would be a great signing too.

&gt;Okay I'm telling you now, the open borders policy is a long term ambition and would not be implemented anytime soon.

exact same answer as you gave before, and again, please explain how MG400-454 are any different from open borders. They are all policies designed to open the borders. Those are all listed as **short term policies**. If not, what are the short-short term policies?

&gt;Why do you feel the Greens will jeopardise your living standards?

Because your policies include:

* Stop economic growth

* Allow massive amounts of immigration

* somehow fund a massive expansion of the state to support the increased population. 

Why should anyone vote for a party that clearly has no clue how to fund its policies? Stall the economy and then expand the state, with no intention of growing the economy?

&gt;who are we tell people where they can and can't live?

We are the people already here, and the people who (by Green party policy) will be supporting the new migrants. Jobs are already a issue, but the green party wants to let a large amount of unskilled labour into the country, and to somehow fund them with a stalled economy and a bloated state? And due to some magical reason, there is no tensions between the native population and the migrants? Skilled Labourers will be allowed in under every other parties system. Can you please justify PP107 and MG205. 

MG204b even states that the Green party is against migration that adversely affects the native population, but do Britons not count as native? 

And why do the Greens claim that they support all cultures when NY300 states:

&gt;NY300 We will work to create a world of global inter-responsibility in which the concept of a **'British national' is irrelevant and outdated.**

So all cultures except British Culture? Does the green party support the rights of minority groups to choose their own culture over British values? Do minority cultures have a right to acts such as FGM? Arranged marriage? Homophobia? [The UN](http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/theme/international-migration/) report indicates that there is going to be a large amount of migration from countries with such values to richer countries. Some reports include as much as 9 million more Migrants to the UK, to say nothing of any indigenous increase in population. Thats before you propose to encourage migration. 

&gt;increase in foreign aid, are designed to limit the need for people to emigrate elsewhere.

Again, how is this funded. And how on earth do you think that Britain will be able to fund a change in living standards to such a degree that third world countries have a living standard so high that its more appealing to stay than come to the UK.",null,0,null,1427205655,null,0,false,0,cpp2ge2,null,t3_3026ob,null,t1_cpp2ge2,null,t1_cpp0yb4,null,null,null,1431984371,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

My morals are nothing to do with it. Nobody has a right to hate speech. Nobody has a right to expect hate speech by published for them, and in fact to do so might be illegal. That's enshrined in law, and it's nothing to do with morals, mine or anyone else's.

&gt; This is Matthew 19: 9: ""I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery.""

'And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.'

Compare 'But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.' (Matthew 5:32)

Anyone marrying the divorcee commits adultery. The NT is pretty consistent in this:

'Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery.' (Luke 16:18)

'And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her. And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery.' (Mark 10:11-12)

'And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband. But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife.' (1 Corinthians 7:10-11)

'For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband. So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.' (Romans 7:3-2)

The NT clearly tells us that we should not divorce, a man may only divorce in case of infidelity, that relations with anyone else is adultery, and that divorced women may not remarry unless their husband dies.

&gt;Good thing i'm not Catholic then

Crimea is gone. The Ukrainians should have accepted it decades ago, instead their flirtation with ultra nationalist fascism has caused the other russophone regions to break away too in revulsion at the Ukrainian government.

This is a fantastic post but poch plays a formation  for a reason. Also throwing in a third cb doesn't necessarily make us a better defensive team,  let alone playing wbs. I think the formation we play is fine. I think as the squad matures it will only get better.

Labour's economic plan isn't great, but IMHO it's seriously less bad than the Tory plan.

Cutting investments in assets to promote growth to me to be the most insane part of austerity, and Labour are not going to do this.

Labour intend to cut only £7bn in order to eliminate the structural deficit (day-to-day spending) in the next parliament, which means they can end austerity soon in the next parliament. If they keep cutting at the current rate, austerity would be ended by 2016 - next year. It goes to show how misleading the 'they're all the same' narrative is.

Fuel isn't such a big problem that I've ever felt the need to take extra, though France can be a pain on Sundays when everything is closed and a some petrol stations only take local cards. 

I like to spend lots of time finding routes and roads I want to take and plugging them into my garmin. Doesn't mean you have to plan your whole route before you go, but it's easy to end up doing lots of boring Payage/Autopista if you don't have good alternatives easily to hand. I also like booking.com because one of their filters is for accommodation with secure parking. Combine that with distance from you and you can generally find a place to stay and store your bike within a 15-30 minute ride. Takes a lot of the time and hassle out of the end of the day. 

If you can't stretch to lockable hard luggage, make sure your stuff is easy to get on and off the bike and you can carry it in and out of hotels/hostels easily. Nothing worse than having to spend an hour loading and unloading your bike every day. 

I try to travel as light as possible and taking spares and tools adds a lot of weight, so I tend to just make sure I've got extra bulbs, fuses, chain oil (before I got a shaft) and tire pressure gauge. It's not like you're going to outer Mongolia, and Euro breakdown cover is pretty cheap. I realise some people really like the independence of having everything they need with them, but don't feel like this is something you have to do.

Not really, we need to change our attitudes a bit towards road use, especially in towns and cities, cycling is a great low cost way of cutting congestion, improving air quality, and the populations health.

&gt;FINALLY. So you at last admit divorce is acceptable in certain circumstances? Took you long enough.

And you're just ignoring my reasons why I, personally, am okay with remarriage after divorce like you did the hair thing when you realised you were wrong there? Cool. So we can move on from this irrelevance?

What I said all along that divorcees should not remarry, which is what the Bible says, and which was the point I made in my original post. 

What does what you personally think about marriage after divorce have to do with anything? The debate is a Christian marriage, the sole authority for which has to come from the Bible. You can have whatever views on the matter you like, but they're not scriptural, and they're not Christian. You can't just pick and choose the parts of God's holy word that suits you. 

Hair, gold silver etc. clearly refers to how women should dress in church. Peter and Paul both make the point that women should not be dressed ostentatiously or draw attention to themselves with their dress, or wear fancy expensive clothing. 99/100 weddings feature the bride doing just that. 

Next you'll be telling me you think women should be allowed to talk in church, or even minister.

&gt;Not at all, I think that if you get married you should do absolutely everything possible to make that marriage work and I personally would only ask for a divorce in a matter of infidelity. I am not disagreeing that marriage is sacred. I am not saying divorce should be recognised as the go to for all issues. I am not setting out deciding i'm going to get divorced. I am mearly acknowledging that I know I will be forgiven if it comes to it.

Freedom comes at a price.

&gt; If you want to back then Ukrainians then at least don't whitewash them.

Could you please tell me where i ""white wash"" the Ukrainians crimes? In my personal opinion both Russia and Ukraine have done horrible and disgusting things. But there is also a clear aggressor between them. (Its Russia in case you are too brainwashed to realise).

&gt; Next, by your own admission Svoboda have 7 mps in government, so again I am right in saying that there are fascists in the Ukrainian government.No Bullshit, they literally have Nazis in their government and in their state run national guard.

So does Russia... Infact we (Britain) have 2 BNP members in local government as of 2015. I guess you are also in favour of Russia invading Britain.........................................................................................................................

Please, stop with this absurdity. Nazi's exist in every country. Including Russia. Infact Russia has **more** Nazi skin head MP's than Ukraine. I guess you are also in favour of nuking Russia then because you are so against Nazism. Infact just last week Putin personally invited almost every Nazi political party in Europe to a ""conservative"" forum. Including Nick fucking Griffon, the BNP leader.

So, we better invade Russia then; because if Nazi's exist according to you its justified.

&gt; The water is muddied further when it we find out that Crimea was an autonomous region with its own president which voted to break away from the Ukraine in the 90's but the Ukrainian government ignored the referendum and deposed the president .

Why does that muddy the water kremlinbot?

&gt; Crimea is gone. The Ukrainians should have accepted it decades ago, instead their flirtation with ultra nationalist fascism has caused the other russophone regions to break away too in revulsion at the Ukrainian government.

Or it could be the fact that Russia is invading them and the Russian state owned media (which you are clearly parroting) is stoking ethnic tensions.

&gt; I know the western media and government like to paint a picture where if the evil Russians would just leave poor little Ukraine alone they would have no problems whatsoever, but that is quite obviously bollocks and dangerously naive.

Define ""western media"", because as of now it only means ""whoever disagrees with the Kremlin"". I know you Kremlin bots like to paint it as Russia vs ""The west""/America, but its almost the entire international community which agrees on this. 

&gt; Ukraine is going through a civil war. The split is based on ethnic, cultural, geographical and political lines. The Russians were never not going to act to protect their people against a historical enemy on their own border.

Its a Russian invasion stoked by Russian state owned media which you are clearly eating up.

If you had any objectivity you would get past this ""hurr durr Ukraine is Nazi's"" bullshit because Russia has a massive problem with them. But the brainwashing has gone too far.

null,false,MJRocky,null,null,null,"Initially I was being a bit cheeky but you're right there's young talent. And the hardest part is bridging the gap between U-21 football and first team football. 

But the biggest issue here is that the FA is oftentimes biting their nose off to spite their face. These quotas don't do anything on their own to improving the talent level of English players. However, what it does is place a premium on English talent and the top English teams will poach talent to round out their squad. And since currently there's not much of that elite talent to begin with, the teams will just pick up HG players to fill out their quota. But in reality, these players aren't playing over a lot of the better foreign players in the league.

The fact that the PL is such a monetary giant now is both a blessing and a curse. A blessing because even the lowest-placed teams have more money than a lot of other European teams. A curse because this makes it so that English teams are the only ones with any reason to pay inflated prices for English talent. Dyke and the FA love to cite these numbers whenever the issue comes up:

&gt;In 2014, just 23 English players were playing Champions League football. That compares with 78 Spanish players, 55 from Germany and even 51 from Brazil – and the numbers will only get worse. If we want to maintain a national side capable of competing against the world’s best, we need change.

What they seemingly don't understand (willfully or otherwise) is that there are only 4 teams that make the CL. Even if all 12 English players at the 4 clubs played in the CL (stretch) that'd be 48, and STILL the lowest on that list. You know why there are so many Spaniards, Germans, French, etc playing in the CL? Because not only do they play in their domestic league, but they also *move abroad to play for foreign teams*. 

I think moves like Ravel Morrison going to Lazio are good for English players, and should be encouraged in some cases. Perhaps moving to a team/league where it's easier to break in as a younger player would be good (Germany has a similar playing style to England and young players can thrive there). But as I say it these proposed restrictions might discourage this, seeing as they are tightening up their homegrown prerequisites. And thus the logical fallacy circle of the FA is complete.

Dyke and the FA need to take a good, hard look in the mirror and figure out the real problems and try to fix them at a grassroots level first imo. Starting at the very top and implementing restrictions and quotas and policies and expecting them to magically fix everything overnight is not going to make things better. For instance, here's his take on the newly put in place Elite Player Performance Plan:

&gt;The Premier League clubs, who invest millions of pounds through their academies and the Elite Player Performance Programme (EPPP), are doing a fantastic job at developing young talent. But many of the home grown players being developed at these academies are not breaking through to play regular first team football.

For my fund portfolio I read through their [slow and steady portfolio](http://monevator.com/the-slow-and-steady-passive-portfolio-update-q3-2014/) and basically bought the Fidelity low cost equivalent funds.

In hindsight, I've overcomplicated it as there are 7 funds in my portfolio (World, US, UK, Europe ex-UK, Emerging Markets, Japan, Pacific ex-Japan). Frankly I can't see there would have been much difference it I'd just lumped the whole lot into a single 100% equity tracker fund. Coincidentally the [latest Monevator post](http://monevator.com/how-to-chooose-total-world-equity-trackers/) says much the same thing.

Sorry - the ""treat as a bonus"" thing doesn't make any sense in hindsight. It was a throwaway comment meant to imply that you shouldn't worry too deeply about the money in the company pension at present - for starters, that money is at least invested! Worrying about that will only delay you further. I'd probably invest it in a similar fashion - 100% world tracker. Maybe you might want to look at something riskier - putting together a set of funds similar to the slow and steady portfolio, but instead with a higher emerging market weighting? But really you're moving towards active management there, and statistically we're probably better off just passively tracking the world market.

So personal opinion

- I'd get all of your savings into a world fund tracker. Not actively managed. The ones on the Monevator front page article will work just as well within an ISA as within a pension.
- I'd do the same with whatever's currently within the company pension. I don't have a company pension so am not totally familiar with the amount of choice you'd have, but frankly a 100% low-fee world fund tracker isn't going to put you far wrong given your long investment horizon.

Clearly, I had read it, since I was able to discuss the mechanics of it in my first post. Making a snide comment otherwise is not only bad rhetoric, it's disengenuous, which is a kind of lying that God doesn't appreciate.

So I misquoted - it doesn't change the thrust of the point. Gay marriage is an abomination is also hate speech. Saying that gay people shouldn't have the same rights as straight people is hate speech.

&gt;Nope but sure look you'd need to read the thing to know that.

Er, yes. I've read them several times. Chapter 2 of 1 Timothy starts with a clear title: INSTRUCTIONS ON WORSHIP. It's clearly taking about church worship, if you'd paid it even half a glance. This is the same chapter from where we get the injunction on women speaking in church or having authority over men, so it gets brought up quite frequently between people who actually know the Bible.

Forgot to mention this peach from your last point:

&gt;By that logic everyone should be Christian as there are more Christians than any other religion.

Learn to logic. Are you going to tell me Catholics aren't Christian now?

&gt;You're really not getting the whole ""try your best not to"" thing are you?

Yeah, ok, I'll try my best not to kill anyone. No worries if I do, though, all is forgiven.

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mandrake/6474595/Prince-Charles-lobbies-Andy-Burnham-on-complementary-medicine-for-NHS.html

&gt;Prince Charles has described himself as a meddling prince, but prefers to describe what he does as ""mobilising"". He told an NBC documentary crew in 2010 he felt ""born into this position for a purpose"", explaining: ""I don't want my grandchildren or yours to come along and say to me: 'Why the hell didn't you come and do something about this?'"" So he has waded into the political sphere on pet topics, such as planning, the environment and medicine. He scrawls ""black spider memos"" to government ministers, calls secretaries of state into Clarence House for private conversations about policy, and writes confidential notes to high-level contacts to get planning matters changed.

&gt;""We got a phone call from the people at the Royal Opera House one evening, about 9pm saying 'good scheme, but you're too risky',"" Rogers said. ""I was basically told: 'the prince does not like you'. These are the ­interventions we know about, but there may be others.""

http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/jun/16/richard-rogers-prince-charles-architecture

&gt;Former environment minister Michael Meacher recalled that he and the prince ""would consort together quietly"" to affect policy on climate change and genetically modified crops. He said they worked together ""to try and ensure that we increased our influence within government"" and to ""persuade Tony Blair to change course"". Asked if there might be a constitutional problem in the prince taking a political opinion, Mr Meacher replied: ""Well, over GM I suppose you could well say that. Maybe he was pushing it a bit. I was delighted, of course.""

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-28066081

&gt; Lord Haskins, who led the Rural Recovery Task Force following the foot-and-mouth outbreak, said many public figures viewed Charles as a ""lobbyist"". They think they have to give a ""disproportionate"" amount of time listening to his point of view and they know he is trying to use his position to influence policy, he said. Former personal assistant Elaine Day, who lost a claim against unfair dismissal, said the prince wrote letters addressed and signed off by himself to influential people ""a great deal"". She worked at Clarence House in 2005 and described the prince's office as ""a very influential lobby group"". ""And there are no doors that are closed to that lobby group, every door opens,"" she added. However Sir Michael said: ""It is ...the Prince of Wales's right - as a Privy Councillor - to consult and advise his Privy Council colleagues on a private and confidential basis."" 

&gt; The programme also claims that a professor at Exeter University faced possible dismissal after a letter of complaint from Sir Michael. Edzard Ernst, professor of complementary medicine, criticised a draft of a report by the Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health to the press. A subsequent letter to the vice chancellor led to a disciplinary procedure and was an attempt to silence him, he claimed. 

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6442109.stm

&gt; ""He carried it out in a very considered, thoughtful and researched way. He often referred to himself as a 'dissident' working against the prevailing political consensus."" He said Charles later did not attend a state banquet thrown by Chinese President Jiang Zemin ""as a deliberate snub"". 

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4734798.stm

&gt;Prince Charles is ""perfectly entitled"" to voice opinions or privately lobby ministers, the prime minister [Tony Blair] has said.

From 17 June 2014, we’ll review UK buyer disputes regarding intangible items where the customer claims they have not received the item, or if the service or goods are not as described. We’re also extending the time for UK buyers to open a dispute from 45 to 180 days from the payment date.
You should be prepared to provide compelling evidence that you provided the intangible item and it was as you described it to be, should a buyer dispute a transaction.
Purchases by UK buyers of most items can be covered except real estate, businesses, vehicles, custom-made items, industrial machinery, items equivalent to cash and items prohibited by PayPal’s Acceptable Use Policy or that violate eBay’s prohibited or restricted items policy.
We expect your business will be able to benefit from this change too because of the extra confidence buyers will have when shopping for intangible items.
PayPal will consider all claims on their merits. If, as a seller, you can show us that you did provide the goods or services as described, we may (but are not obliged to) reject the buyer’s claim.

I was on the work programme (Avanta) and they kept getting my address mixed up with other people that were on the course, for 4 months it went on. I was receiving other peoples appointments to my address. Eventually I filled in a complaints form with the jobcentre about it as every time they stated that they had corrected my address, the following week another sanction would come through for not turning up to an appointment they hadn't notified me about.

That complaint letter ended up on the desk of my adviser at the work programme. She kicked off big time whilst I was sat at her desk and eventually accused *me* of starting an argument. She told me she had to go and cool off in the staff room and left me at her desk for 15 minutes twiddling my thumbs whilst her colleagues stared daggers at me. 

On her coming back she pulled the manager over. The manager told me that it's impossible for them to change addresses on their system without written permission from myself and was adamant that I was responsible for my address being changed every week. I asked her to produce these forms that I had apparently filled in and she refused. 

Funnily enough when I did actually move I informed the jobcentre a week before my moving of my new address. My advisor there fille din the forms and sent them over to Avanta himself, knowing how many problems I'd had in the past.

4 weeks after moving and the sanctions start rolling in again. My advisor at the jobcentre spent 2 hours of his morning trying to chase them up with Avanta. They turned up on the desk of my advisor, having not been actioned.

I eventually got the local MP involved after my 9th sanction had went on for 6 weeks without any word on my mandatory reconsideration. I phoned the sanction department with the MPs secretary listening in on the call and they told me that they hadn't received such a form (which was done in person at the jobcentre) and told me to fill another one in and that it'd be a further 6 weeks until I could expect word back.

The MPs secretary was more furious than I was. She got it sorted by the next morning - She had to use the MPs official email address in order to get to somebody high enough up the line to fast track it.

Imagine a simple pedestrian crossing across a road at the top of a hill – the traffic is flowing one way, up the hill. 

I crossed the light when it was green in my favour and a cyclist came up on my right hand side – coming off the pedestrianised area – and cut across in front of me and sped off down the hill against the legal traffic flow. 

I did nothing wrong. The cyclist did everything wrong. The end.

&gt;Walker Mason Bentaleb Rose

&gt;Lamela Eriksen

&gt;Kane

&gt;It naturally creates some great passing diamonds - Vertonghen or Dier can step into midfield to contribute to the build up on their side, while the other two slide over to cover. Walker and rose are able to stretch play higher up the pitch, providing that width that we just don't have (while maintaining a 4 man midfield!), and in turn opening up the channels for runs in behind. Eriksen and Lamela can take up the positions they want to - in the halfspaces instead of on the wings - and if you put someone in to shut down the DM space (Zouma) he can't cover both of them at the same time.

&gt;I actually thought this all out - complete with sketches and matchups haha - before realizing that it's what Liverpool use, but hey maybe that gives it more credence as a viable formation!

The rules should be aimed at that specifically rather than a quota. All the quota serves to do is make Jack Rodwell (et so many al) so ridiculously sought after he costs a fuck of a lot of money but isn't actually good enough to play. This serves absolutely no one. Rodwell can't play and can't get better. Yet it would be pointless for City to have a player that can't even fulfil a squad role.

That's actually detrimental to the English game. The FA hasn't realised this and continues not to. The Germans implemented a lot more of the original FA report before most of this began, including an entire overhaul of the youth organisation structure, the coaching habits and the way schools operated in germany.

And finally, B teams. We absolutely have to fucking have them. We cannot continue to exist in FIFA and UEFA rules without them, or we need loans changed from being transfers.

All of these FA rules ignore the reality of playing, they're wonderful in theory but do fuck all for the actual players. The FA are mindless pieces of shit that have no idea. Marginally better than most FAs but seriously, Dyke is a joke. He's pathetic and has always been pathetic. And I think he knows the real answer is B clubs but that everyone keeps rejecting them he has no idea what to do. And obviously the answer is get awareness in the media, which he is calamitously bad for.

What change? The cyclists that care already act that way and those that don’t won’t change. There’s no incentive for them to and very little action ever seems to be taken against bad cyclists. 

I haven’t the energy to live my life fighting that kind of thing. Doesn’t mean I like it, mind you. 

&gt; Not really, we need to change our attitudes a bit towards road use, especially in towns and cities, cycling is a great low cost way of cutting congestion, improving air quality, and the populations health.

Sure, but right here you're preaching to the choir. This sub is already comprised mostly of people who's opinion you don't need to change. This is just another echo chamber where the same faces predictably show up to add their 2 cents on how things need to change. 

It's like a local council neighbourhood watch meeting. Believe me, I've seen those two. They're remarkably similar. 

&gt; That's why many people, such as myself are in favour of doing everything we can to bring it to the public attention.

This isn't public attention, it's the same old faces. I'm sorry to hear of your accident and I've been knocked off my bicycle twice by drivers too: but I doubt they read this sub.

That's kind of the trouble... there's no education in responsible cycling. I see cyclists *daily* take stupid risks, use pavements busy with pedestrians etc.

Rodwell is worth more to City as a bench warmer than he is to Everton as a starter. And that's the massive bloody problem. He should be worth more to the club as a starter where ever he is, because on merit he deserves to start.

&gt;sociopathic lack of concern for another professional player

&gt;disgraceful outburst of blatant thuggery

Also, with the changes to the youth system which allows the bigger clubs to cherry pick talent from smaller teams it creates more headaches for bringing 18-21 year old players through to top flight football.

Crime is linked to poverty. Black people are disproportionately in poverty. Black people are therefore disproportionately represented in high crime/low income areas. These areas get the most Police resources due to crime. Knife crime and gang crime is disproportionately an issue in black areas. Knife crime is a major issue and the main focus of stop and search. Black people are therefore disproportionately stopped and searched due to a whole other host of factors that are not Police related.

I think one of Balo or Lambert will probably leave. I kind of suspect it will be Balo. Like all of us, I want him to come good but idk, I dont think Rogers rates him either tbh. It seems like we'll be in for a new striker this summer if you believe the papers so maybe something like this for next season:

Sturridge, New guy (Vietto?), Origi (whos also a bit of a winger), Lambert 

(this is a bit sketchy tho b/c Origi and the new guy are unproven in the pl. mind, balo and borini aren't great either :/)

**attacking mids / wingers**

Coutinho, Sterling, Lallana, Markovic, Ibe, Teixiera, Luis Alberto

Am I forgetting anyone? I have a feeling one of Teixeira or Alberto will stay, with the other leaving (or loaning again?). Otherwise, I think we're pretty much good here.


**box-to-box / holding mids**

Henderson, Lucas, Allen, Can

I have a feeling Lucas might leave this summer. I dont want us to lose anymore senior players tho, so I hope he doesn't. I agree with OP tho. I think we'll need another experienced mid who can do a defensive job, allowing Henderson to get up the field more.


**Center backs**

I think Sakho far and away our best CB and the rest of the defense should be built around him. This will lead to some tough questions, because its hard to rationalize leaving Skrtel out when he's such an important player (both on the field as of late, and as a senior guy around the camp). Its seems like there is no combination of Lovren, Sakho and Skrtel that works well in a back 4. Maybe a good DM will solve this, who knows?


**fullbacks**

I'm getting tired of writing this shit damn.

this is what i hope for next season:

LBs: Moreno, flanagan as a back up

RBs: New guy, Manquillo, flanagan over here too

I think Moreno will come good, he just needs a bit of trust and direction.

Even if all 12 English players at the 4 clubs played in the CL (stretch) that'd be 48, and STILL the lowest on that list. You know why there are so many Spaniards, Germans, French, etc playing in the CL? Because not only do they play in their domestic league, but they also move abroad to play for foreign teams.

Yeah, and if there are a lot more decent English players coming through then German, Spanish, Italian and French teams will buy them too. So you could have a lot more English players in the CL than just those playing for English clubs. Players like Keegan, Lineker, Hughes, Wilkins, Platt, Ince, Trevor Francis and McManaman have done very well abroad. 
It hasn't happened in the past 15 years or so because there hasn't been as large a pool of talented English players, coupled with the fact that English sides had the money to keep their best players. 

&gt; These quotas don't do anything on their own to improving the talent level of English players. However, what it does is place a premium on English talent and the top English teams will poach talent to round out their squad. And since currently there's not much of that elite talent to begin with, the teams will just pick up HG players to fill out their quota.

I think it would place a premium on English players at first, but that would eventually be reduced as there are more coming through, and clubs have to develop their own players anyway.

Sorry but as a pedestrian - consider the trickle down effect that I *really* don't care what justification you have for bad cycling. I am 100% going to be the victim if someone takes to the pavement to avoid motorists and hits me. 

That's not to say I don't recognise the issues of bad infrastructure or motorists - I do - but *still* that doesn't justify cycling that is a bother, threat or danger to other people (typically pedestrians).

Cyclists expect (rightly) that motorists conduct themselves responsibly. The retort ‘but we have bad infrastructure, which encourages bad driving and risk taking around cyclists’ holds no water, I’m sure you would agree. 

So shift that focus along slight and there’s really no reason not to expect cyclists to conduct themselves in a similarly responsible manner. If you can’t then you shouldn’t be cycling and should get off and walk, or find some other way of getting around. 

I’m sure you’d say the same to any motorist who claimed they had no choice in how they conduct themselves?

&gt; The probability of a successful engagement can be translated into the more commonly used metric of a kill ratio by making some reasonable statistical assumptions, and doing this yields about 10.0:1 for the F-22A, 4.6:1 for the Typhoon, 1.5:1 for the single seat F-15E, 1:1 for the Rafale and 0.75:1 for the F-15C. So in the most common terms used, the Typhoon is by the DERA simulation about half as combat effective as the F-22A, about three times as combat effective as the F-15F, about five times as effective as the Rafale and 6 times as effective as the F-15C. If we compare this with cited USAF claims rating the F-22A as 10-15 times as combat effective as the F-15C in BVR engagements, this means that the DERA study roughly agrees with USAF assessments of F-22A vs F-15C combat effectiveness. The detailed assumptions applied to this study have not been disclosed.

I think it's important that the best club in England is reflected in the English national team, as we were for so long previously (both with Abramovich and before). Prior to the Roman era we still had a considerable amount of players in the national team, Le Saux played parts, Lampard was obviously a figure and Terry played (whilst never actually starting for a long time due to the Campbell Ferdinand love in). Going further back we had Ray Wilkins, Venables, Dennis Wise even had caps for England! I'm sure there are a lot more than I can remember off the top of my head as well.


I completely agree that in the current England squad there aren't players who are good enough to get in our first team. I don't think Rooney our Sturridge are better than our starting forwards and Sterling is no better than Oscar. I do think, however, that we should be a representation for the strength of English football by having quality England players in our team. Whether that's bringing in English talent from other clubs or truly having home grown players come through our ranks and represent both us and England.

Gavin and Stacey was fucking brilliant. There are lines, moments, and performances in that show that are going to be extremely hard to top, and while it's an ensemble programme, he and Ruth Jones wrote it and played characters that would go on to [""break out""](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutCharacter)

So the BBC found itself with a very rare thing: this ridiculously well-received and popular comedy that works as both broad entertainment and well-written comedic drama. What to do with the stars, these amazing people who just pulled this thing out of thin air and would surely make the corporation £millions in DVD sales?

Ruth Jones kept it trill - she wrote some more, did some ""serious acting"", and popped up in the occasional indie comedy, but generally stayed on the right side of credibility. Corden, though, got teamed up with Matthew Horne (i.e. Gavin) and they put out a sketch show. Actually, ""put out"" is an understatement - they wrote it and performed it, and then the BBC spent weeks hyping it up as a huge comedy phenomenon in the making. It was shit. And I don't mean ""I don't like it"", it was universally panned, nobody watched it, the BBC paid way too much for it. Then Corden started getting voice-over work for adverts, he did some presenting gigs, and suddenly he was everywhere.

The thing is, his overtly extrovert and outgoing personality is great in a sitcom where you're on a script, but in real life it's just... Annoying. Especially when he's presenting all these shows, turning up in the papers, making stupid statements, getting into fights with Picard, and generally being really full of himself. Because, of course, he's had years of people blowing smoke up his arse telling him how brilliant he is.

I don't *hate* him, by the way, I just think he peaked at the very start of his career, and that people have been offering him all this media work as a result of that early success, which led to overexposure, a big ego, and a public backlash.

Yes some cyclists need to be reminded of the law. Or more importantly common curtasy. 

But when cars kill 34 people a year by going on the pavement or kerb. And many more people interacting with public roads in some otherway.

If he tightens his budget when not working how much would his monthly living costs be?

If we say £1k per month and he's unemployed for an average of two months per year then out of the £12k a year he's currently using to service debts he needs to be putting £2k a year aside to cover his time out of work.  

I'd suggest *lowering* the amount repaid per month slightly and putting a percentage into a separate account to act as an emergency fund expressly for this purpose.

Going by the entirely made up numbers I just came up with that means he should be saving £200 per month and using the other £800 to service his existing debts. This means he'll be able to survive for two months a year with no income without having to borrow additional funds.

As for recommendations... I usually just scroll on popcorn time and check ratings against rottentomatoes followed by watching a trailer. Next on my queue is Song of the Sea and The Tale of the Princess Kaguya (but I happen to love animated films). Also maybe it was my high expectations but while Big Hero 6 was good I felt a bit disappointed. Fairly similar feeling about The Theory of Everything. Gone Girl was quite good though I'd guess you've seen that. I also quite enjoyed The Imitation Game but I'd watch it before reading much about it. Hmm... i guess thats pretty extensive but I'd definitely check out more of Wes Andersen's films if you haven't yet and though it wasnt particularly special I had an unjustifiable fondness for The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (maybe just cause I liked the songs and the travelling)

He didn't even look over his shoulder, he just pulled straight into the car's path.

Also it's not just car/lorry drivers that are in the wrong here.

There's a junction near where I work where as a cyclist you have to be VERY careful of pedestrians - normally in the morning, single parent+multiple kids walking to school. There's a roundabout with a marked cycle lane around the edge and coming off it on this junction the lane continues on for a few metres and then ends. Right where it ends, there's a lowered kerb where people can cross over to a traffic island in the middle of the road.

What people do here, is simple *walk out with their kidbuggy/pushchair* **into the middle of the end of this frickin cycle lane** without even looking.

Just this morning I almost saw some poor little kid holding her mum's hand get knocked over by another cyclist because this stupid woman walked straight into the cycle lane without even looking, just as a cyclist was coming past.

She then had the audacity to blame the cyclist for almost hitting her kids, despite the cyclist screaming ""LOOK OUT"" at her.

His value is ridiculous and that is never likely to change with the quota. And then the failures in Europe will continue and the league will gradually become weakened. The whole point of the PL is that it's the creme de la creme of the football world in total. That's what it's current ""golden era"" is based around. I really wonder why the FA has broken out of the PL. Their ideas seem completely opposed to each other at this point and are frankly pathetic. It should really only be in charge of the Football league at this point (and they already have a higher HG quota) and it should practically treat the PL as it does the CL. Except that would destroy some of the nationalist pride in having the ""best"" league. 

Clubs need to have the strong english core and leadership idea impressed upon them. Saying that, I don't see any future English captains in our near future. Which is again a problem, and likely a problem from poor game time. At the same time, I see it as a problem that will have to be fixed for the Chelsea team to be successful and therefore less of an issue.

So what I guess this new quota should be viewed as is trying to fix the failing old one? Which unless you somehow fix the price of other foreign players a la equal gender insurance premiums then it's pretty much pointless. We can't impose a tariff and we certainly can't impose something similar to the premiums because presumably the FA would pocket it and not invest it.

There are of course elements that make sense. But all these conversations about the quota seem superflous to me as long as the poor youth structure exists. And I've been thinking for a while now that the football league could probably do with a few tiers wiping off it. It has to become less bloated, it's extraordinarily wasteful and those at the smaller academies have almost no prospects after falling out of the academy. Something which the FA doesn't even address.

Perhaps with a GB team in all olympics etc, we should also create a GB league system. I'd prefer it tbh. Even if it may mean losing the old firm derby etc. The main reason I think that this needs to be proposed is because it gives you a platform of change.

null,false,Blubbey,null,null,null,"Yeah it seems a bit strange:

1) We have two CBs who can cover there as a last resort in Dier and Vlad, more so Vlad as he's unlikely to play in the middle. However a dedicated player in that position would be nice and a better CB would be ideal, so that could change.

2) Yedlin is 22 in a few months, so he's not that young (aka an academy teen), not a ""seriously"" long term option as he's about 3 years younger than Walker. 

3) You also shouldn't be ""raw"" at 21/22, you should be very much getting into your stride as a player. To compare them, Walker was PFA young player of the year and in the team of the year at Yedlin's age (21, 11/12 season). I would expect Yedlin to at least be a regular in the U21 team to get accustomed to matches, playing style and get match fitness, but that's not happening. Whether that's a false flag, I don't know.

4) We still have Fredericks on loan and he's pretty good *and* he's home grown and less than a year older than Yedlin. Currently playing for Middlesbrough, doing well and they're fighting for promotion ([third, a point behind the leaders](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/championship/table)). Considering he joined 3 or 4 years ago and Poch's preference for bringing through players, again he seems like the natural option instead of buying another player.

5) We have KWP, currently 17 and 18 in a few weeks. From the games I've seen he looks like a serious player and I wouldn't be surprised if he gets some time in the first team in a couple of seasons. Homegrown, U21, academy player and a very good one at that? Dream. He looks to be the long term option over Walker in a few years time.

6) By the time Yedlin should arguably be in his prime (27) KWP will be 23 and Walker will be 30. Assuming they're still in the squad, Poch's preference for youth and KWP's ability to grow from an already impressive player (17-&gt;23 *should* be a serious jump in ability).... why would you not pick KWP?

Russian economy will go through pain as it finds new markets, such is the way of business. You will find that there are many states that care little about the the american and euro sanctions. The BRICS have no problems doing business at all and the sanctions seem to be pretty toothless to the oligarchs. London property is still being bought, luxury yachts made in Britain are still being sold to Russians an alternative to SWIFT is being set up with the Chinese. And in time, Putin will outlast Merkel, Cameron and whatever embarrassment sits in the white house.

The main divide between our thinking is that you seem to be semi hysterical and think Russia is about to reboot the USSR and start WW3.
Stop and think how stupid that sounds, it is never going to happen. You have to grow up and be more pragmatic, Russian speaking Ukraine was never going to join the Euro and NATO, Crimea is always going to be the home of the Russian black sea fleet.

This isn't ww3 bud, just more geopolitics,its been going on forever. 
Here is what will likely happen, 
Putin will not be over thrown.
Russia will not collapse economically.
The Ukraine will collapse economically and have no way of prosecuting a campaign against the seceded territories. Fighting will cease or at least diminish to mere sporadic skirmishes.
Crimea will remain in Russian control militarily, possibly as an autonomous republic.
The Ukrainian separatist regions will be partitioned from Ukraine, with possibly a Euro/Russian peace keeper force observing a referendum as a price for Russian withdrawal of military forces. The regions will be independent in name only.

The world will move on.

It's not wise to advise everyone to go to their GP if they're feeling despondent. It's more nuanced than that. 



Mental illnesses are diseases of the brain that cause inappropriate reactions to situations, in a broad sense. Depression causes inappropriate despondency and lack of motivation. Schizophrenia causes inappropriately erratic thinking and delusional ideas. Bipolar mania causes inappropriately elevated or depressed moods. Personality disorders cause inappropriate social behaviour, often linked to erratic emotional or violent outbursts, and a pattern of struggling with interpersonal relationships and achieving life goals is clear throughout young adulthood.



But there are people who think that having a bad breakup means that you have depression, or that being tidy makes you OCD, and that places strain on services that are unsuitable for that group of people.

Few English players venture abroad for several reasons: Footballing reasons, comfortability with English culture, and monetary. If everyone thinks that the PL is the best league of the world, why would they leave? Also, if they're getting paid more than they would anywhere else, there's little incentive to go abroad. 

&gt;Yeah, and if there are a lot more decent English players coming through then German, Spanish, Italian and French teams will buy them too.

This sounds nice but I disagree. Elite players might move abroad. But if they were just decent or good players they'd be worth much more to English clubs under these new provisos. That's the big point here. What these prospective policies are doing is driving up the price for English players whether they're good or not. It's making these players a valuable commodity not for their talent level, but for their nationality. It's not doing anything to improve the talent pool. Why would some random German team buy a fair English player for £25M when they can probably get a good German player for a quarter of that?

Bigger clubs wouldn't necessarily have to develop their own players. Clubs with less money/draw would probably have to or else they'd struggle. If they're being priced out for decent English talent AND have restrictions for foreign players as well they'd have to bring academy players through. But if these kids aren't good enough but are just put through to make up numbers it would dilute the talent level of the league. 

Top clubs could just cherry pick the players they like to fit the numbers.

null,false,Fineus,eng-westmidlands,"Birmingham, formerly a Southern Pansy",null,"&gt; Lets remember this post is about cyclists getting hit and killed by drivers.

My original point is that this is yet another post on the topic. It occurs more and more that this sub is a corrupt echo chamber for such things. I don't regret commenting on that fact. 

&gt; And as woth any post on this topic on any site. The response os are well cyclists are just as bad. 

Not really my point - though we have drifted that way. However... 

&gt; When evidence and logic states they are not. 

That's comparing apples and oranges. Bicycles are not cars. Cars are not bicycles. Both have their own faults but I've never (as a pedestrian) had to dodge a car driving along a pavement. I have had to dodge a bicycle. 

&gt; Yes some cyclists need to be reminded of the law. Or more importantly common curtasy.

I don't mean this sarcasticly, I am glad you recognise that. 

&gt; But when cars kill 34 people a year by going on the pavement or kerb. And many more people interacting with public roads in some otherway.

But there we're back to apples and oranges - cars are faster and have more mass. Absolutely they have the potential to cause more harm. I would never argue otherwise. 

&gt; The whole but cyclists do this argument gets bloody tired. Yes some are idiots. 

So does the 'motorists are evil!' one. Fair's fair. It's a common theme on this sub. 

&gt; But using them as an excuse for drivers to kill them is totally unacceptable.

I'd be horrified to make that connection. A cyclist might piss me off no end but I'd never deliberately attempt to harm one (be it on foot or car). I realise there are those who are different however - but these are criminals and should be treated as the dangerous individuals they are. 

&gt; And why many on sites like this get a bit pissed of at the argument.

null,false,shoestringcycle,null,null,null,"I didn't justify it, I was explaining why it happens, and also it's worth seeing it in context - you may notice anti-social cycling when walking but it's the driver that will actually hurt or kill you (even on the pavement you're more likely to be killed by a motor-vehicle).

Cycling groups are campaigning for better provision that makes it safer, faster and nicer for both cyclists and pedestrians.

Urban pavement cycling can be anti-social but it's really not comparable to dangerous driving.

There have been no deaths &amp; very very few serious injuries most years in the UK.

Sometimes it's legal, sometimes not, depending not on comfort or safety but whether there's a sign or some paint - often it's not even clear to pedestrians or cyclists where ""shared"" pavements start or stop.

Policing and prosecutions where cyclists have hurt pedestrians are vigorously enforced because cyclists are easy to catch and are rarely able to hit &amp; run, often coming off worse in any collision.

Only 1 in 7 drivers will be found guilty in court if they hit &amp; kill a cyclist in a car but in the very few cases where a cyclist has killed or seriously injured a pedestrian the justice system doesn't let them off with a slap on the wrist

It's also worth noting that drivers have very good provision - unlike pedestrians &amp; cyclists (and rail users any many other groups) but bad driving is encouraged and tolerated in a way that cycling simply isn't, even around pedestrians.

So it's not the same, and neither are ok - but if you want to change then get involved in campaigning for livable streets because 99% of cyclists want the same things as you",null,0,null,1427216782,null,0,false,0,cpp93el,null,t3_304eft,null,t1_cpp93el,null,t1_cpp80g3,null,null,null,1431987512,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Wrong. Reagan tried to mediate between Britain and Argentina, but once he realised Argentina were not going to back down he not only declared US support for Britain, but announced the imposition of economic sanctions against Argentina.

Secondly, just like you Argentina assumed America to be neutral, unfortunately both are wrong.

*Margaret Thatcher stated that ""without the Harrier jets and their immense manoeuvrability, equipped as they were with the latest version of the Sidewinder missile, supplied to us by US Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, we could never have got back the Falklands.""*

&gt; B) A country wouldn't offer a significant resource or help knowing full well the other country can't/won't accept deliberately.

*In early May, Casper Weinberger offered the use of an American aircraft carrier. This seemingly extremely generous offer was seen by some as vital: it was noted by Rear Admiral Woodward that the loss of Invincible would have been a severe setback, but the loss of Hermes would have meant an end to the whole operation. Weinberger admitted  that there would have been many problems if a request had ever been made; not least, it would have meant US personnel becoming directly involved in the conflict, as training British forces to crew the vessel would have taken years.*

Even though he readily admits to having to use US personnel if the offer were accepted.

Of course I see the point you're trying to make but I think instead of race, these things commonly are down to dress. People are stopped and searched on their appearance. 

Black people in suits walking in the city don't get stopped and searched, black people dressed in that typical style of dress you expect from people in gangs or crime do. White people dressed the same are much more likely to be stopped and searched. Now I know you'll have anecdotes you can link me to of black businessmen being stopped, but spare me.

This is another point of contention, fabricated my Loyalists in an attempted justification of the spending. Again misinformation though.. The majority of visitors from outside of the UK would continue to visit, as it is the grounds they tend to frequent (Buckingham Palace etc.) Sure royal appearances and ceremonies might bring in a bit, but mostly non-tourists. By in large losing our royalty wouldn't have anywhere near the effect on tourism as you are insinuating. Fear mongering.

null,false,Rynoh,null,null,null,"Being American I guess i don't really have the same connection with the English national team but I see your point.  I think Chelsea is making a push to grow more talented Homegrown players and the club has invested heavily in the academy for this reason.  In the past Chelsea was not the heavy weight that they are now and didn't always have world class players at every position.  This allowed us to field top level English talent as we didn't have top tier Foreign talent taking those places.  You talk about the pride of having 3 or 4 Chelsea players playing for England but we must remember that they were elite tier athletes.  Lampard is one of the best goal scoring midfielders of all time, Terry was the best defender in the league, Ashley Cole was the best left back on the planet...the fact that these players were English were a bonus but not the reason they were playing for Chelsea.  With the current state of the English national team there are very few players with the talent level to do anything other then ride the bench for Chelsea.  These players get split up between Chelsea, Liverpool, Arsenal, Spurs, Man United, Everton, and Man City.  Even the majority of the English players starting for these teams would struggle to earn a starting spot at Chelsea.  

Now the FA has correctly identified the problem.  It is hard for an English player to break through from academy to first team at a major club and especially at a Champions League level club.  The answer to this isn't to neuter those clubs and force them to buy more English players.  The answer should be to provide a competitive place for these players to play.  I know they are trying to do more with the Under 21 league but it still leads to the haves and have nots.  The top tier under 21 teams largely steamroll the weaker ones and older players in that setup largely get nothing out of it.  What is needed is something similar to a B team setup where the top u21 sides can play against adult competition.  Since England seems to be against this setup I would suggest somekind of a u21 Development league.  I would allow the top academy's in the country to have their own full time league.  This could be accomplished a couple different ways.  1, you could have a league of 10-12 teams run by national team coachs.   These teams would pull youth academy talent from all the clubs in England with the goal of developing these players towards National team duty.  Now I would assume these teams would need to be partnered with different clubs due to location and playstyle so the clubs still have some say in player development.  I would think that these teams could compete in a way similar to international duty but maybe on a more frequent schedule.  The players would spend 1/3 of their time with these national development league teams and 2/3 with their respective parent clubs and their under 21 obligations.  If a team want's to promote a player they can pull him out of the league but he must appear in at least 1/3 of matches while pulled away and must be on the bench at least 1/2 of the time, otherwise they are returned to the development league pool and unable to be called up again for a period of time.",null,0,null,1427218784,null,0,false,0,cppaegr,null,t3_303vww,null,t1_cppaegr,null,t1_cpp869w,null,null,null,1431988128,null,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3,null

Believe what you want Kremlin bot, its quite clear where Tsar V. Putin is taking Russia. Towards more wars in protection of ""ethnic Russians"" all whilst simultaneously blaming you and me (""westerners"") for shit that Putin created and perpetuated.

&gt; You will find that there are many states that care little about the the american and euro sanctions.

Oh, of course. It's **Only** American and European sanctions right? Except its not:

List of non EU countries sanctioning Russia:

1. Australia

2. New Zealand

1. Japan

1. Israel

1. South Korea

1. Switzerland

1. Norway

1. Canada

But clearly its only ""american and euro sanctions""... open your eyes please.

&gt; The BRICS have no problems doing business

The BRICS are a joke. Russia's economy is smaller than California's, one state in 50. Russia's stock market is worth less than apple. I'm sorry but Russia and the rest of the BRICS nations are an absolute joke and have almost no relevance in international politics.

&gt;  at all and the sanctions seem to be pretty toothless to the oligarchs.

So? It is the Russian people we are punishing for supporting a leader who invades whichever country he feels like. If the Russians want to invade countries then they will have to do it without western living standards.

&gt; London property is still being bought, luxury yachts made in Britain are still being sold to Russians

Good, we are still getting that Russian money then.

&gt; an alternative to SWIFT is being set up with the Chinese.

And I'm sure it will flourish without the wests financial organisations. lol just kidding.

&gt; And in time, Putin will outlast Merkel, Cameron and whatever embarrassment sits in the white house.

That's generally what dictators do, I'm glad you see him as such.

&gt; The main divide between our thinking is that you seem to be semi hysterical and think Russia is about to reboot the USSR and start WW3.

Yup, first Kaliningrad then Transnistria then South Ossettia and Abkhazia and now Ukraine and Crimea.

Russia is determined to grab as much land as possible.

&gt;  Stop and think how stupid that sounds, it is never going to happen.

[**That is exactly what Putin said in 2008 about Crimea, keep bleeting sheep.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoMUkDDILcs)

&gt; You have to grow up and be more pragmatic, Russian speaking Ukraine was never going to join the Euro and NATO, Crimea is always going to be the home of the Russian black sea fleet.

It still could have been when Ukraine was in the EU. The EU and Russia do not have to be enemies, only Putin wants them to be.

&gt; This isn't ww3 bud

Not yet, but who the fuck knows when you have a dick like Putin in charge.

&gt;  Russia will not collapse economically.

Too late ""bud"".

&gt; The Ukraine will collapse economically and have no way of prosecuting a campaign against the seceded territories.

Not whilst the west is helping Ukraine out it won't.

&gt;  Fighting will cease or at least diminish to mere sporadic skirmishes.

That is already happening.

&gt; Crimea will remain in Russian control militarily, possibly as an autonomous republic

Sanctions will continue then :)

&gt; The Ukrainian separatist regions will be partitioned from Ukraine

Not likely.

&gt; with possibly a Euro/Russian peace keeper force observing a referendum as a price for Russian withdrawal of military forces.

That is hilarious, Russia is never going to be allowed to peace keep in Ukraine.

another option is the revert back to the 4-4-2 diamond. moreno/flanno on left, flanno/glen on right. sahko and skrtel (if skrtel suspended, play lovren. if skrtel suspended and lovren still injured, play kolo or try can.). lucas at the base, allen + hendo shuttlers and coutinho at the tip. play sturridge and balo in the strikers role. 

last option, go back to a 4-3-2-1. same back line set up, lucas-hendo-allen (can throw emre in there too) and have a front three of sterling and coutinho, raheem slightly more advanced (both have ability to roam) and play sturridge/balo up top. if we don't want sturridge, play ibe and coutinho in the two behind sterling.

There's a difference between something being lawful and it being a good idea. If you make it harder for cars to pass you, by definition you are making it easier for them to accidentally hit you.

Even the slowest motorbikes can do 35mph, so they're perfectly entitled to take the whole lane around town in 30-40mph zones. Tractors don't really have any choice, they're massive! 

But then both farmers in their tractors and 16 year old's on mopeds will move over to let cars pass if they're holding up traffic, where the militant lycra-clad warriors we see on the road today have no such etiquette.

Yes an air gun can kill. But only in a very unique s3t of circumstances. 

A 9mm on the otherhand needs the level of care required for a device that take care not to kill.

Do you really feel that it would be reasonable to expect the same rules to apply to an accident from each. 

Lets face it to hold a real gun in this country you are required to proove you have the skills and responsibility.

The kind of incidents described in the article happen pretty much every day to cyclists, often several times in a journey. A few incidents of annoying people compared with a systematic method of treating cyclists, by people in large, heavy vehicles with the power to easily kill - there is just no equivalence. And this massively reduces the number of people willing to use cycling as a form of transport - something which would have loads of benefits if we could increase it.

Cyclists are taught for their own safety to 'own' the same amount of road as cars do. Cyclists belong in the centre of the lane. If it's not safe to overtake a car, it's not safe to overtake a cyclist. Wait.

Oh come on. Racing bikes are absolutely not the ""proper equipment"" for riding round town. They're fucking inappropriate. I gave one a go myself a little while back, and it's fucking scary riding them. Yes they're fast but they have no grip and thus shit brakes, the wheels are too thin leading to intense fear of sewer grates and the lack of suspension means they're useless on anything but silky smooth tarmac. Not to mention the INSANITY of using clip-in pedals around town.

Bikes like that are meant for racing, not for everyday riding.

EDIT: Just to add that you'd have no problem sticking to the side of the road (like the vast majority of cyclists do) if you were riding an appropriate bike.

Absolutely.  I think most of the idea that cyclists are uniquely badly behaved stems from the fact that cyclists are often moving when drivers are stationary, or moving slowly when drivers are moving quickly, so there's a lot more interaction and disparity of behavior.

People disobey different rules under different modes.  Most drivers break speed limits and many run amber/reds at speed, just as they're changing; pedestrians jaywalk; cyclists run reds in mid-phase, which drivers don't do...

People are used to seeing cars doing 35 in a 30 though, and think nothing of it even though it's putting other people's lives at significantly increased risk.

I fundamentally disagree with your position, but I understand that it's what the vast majority of people want.

And my main problem with that is that it turns the scum of society, the barbaric, and the self-important into folkheroes. I also think it allows for much more revisionism - which allows much more space for ""perception"" and ""stories"" and less for facts and truth.

Which I would presume allows history to more easily repeat itself.

null,false,BadBoyFTW,eng-derbyshire,Derbyshire,null,"&gt;People suffering from it should **tell their GP**, seek support from people they trust and **be reassured that treatment will help.**

I'd just like to share my experiences with this since this is /r/unitedkingdom so we all know we're talking about the NHS.

I've got depression and after dealing with it unsuccessfully for over 18 months I finally reached a point where I felt like it was either visiting the GP or killing myself. It was that simple. I felt I had nothing to lose.

So I went and literally the only 'treatment' they offered me was CBT. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy.

'Fortunately' for me, I have a place nearby which runs and is so overbooked that the GP actually had run out of leaflets to give me. He told me originally the idea was for you to visit your GP then get referred on for an assessment appointment with them... however due to the huge volume of people simply not showing up you now have to self-refer.

One of my secondary problems is pretty bad social anxiety, so making a phone call is a nightmare for me. Getting up the motivation and will power to make a phone call at all is difficult, let alone one I didn't want to make in the first place.

So I used their self-referral thing on their website and ended up missing their call due to the aforementioned anxiety. And I simply couldn't ring them back, that's even worse. So I decided to e-mail them and I got absolutely no reply. They don't bother to check their e-mail.

Eventually I got an appointment... **for three months in the future**. I'm probably going to regret being this candid without a throw-away but lets just say that I almost killed myself right then and there. I'd spent over a year and a half fighting depression and feeling like everything I did to escape it was useless. I spent all day every single day suicidal trying to fight the urge to do a 'dry run' of my suicide plan (which I secretly hoped would 'accidentally' achieve the desired result). Then I find out the only beacon of hope... the 'exit' door I'd refused to acknowledge or approach was instead just a huge queue.

And you know what makes this worse? This wasn't CBT. I wasn't on it yet. This is just a fucking assessment. It was entirely possible I might wait 3 months, attend this 45 minute assessment and be told to fuck off, you're not depressed enough. So I spent 3 months trying to just survive day to day.

Eventually I had my assessment and was accepted onto CBT. Then I found out CBT is a complete fucking joke if you've tried even the most rudimentary steps to help yourself (""have you tried exercising? how about doing stuff?"") but MUCH more importantly it's a fucking joke because you get a fixed number of sessions. **That's not how depression works.** That's not how recovery from it works, either.

I was told I had 6, and only 6, 1-hour sessions. And they were 2-3 weeks apart. Usually I'd go in for my sessions and feel a little better after (just having had somebody to talk to) but ultimately by the next session all progress was completely lost. The way I see it I was literally standing on the edge of the bridge. I was in the ER with slit wrists. I was on the verge of death. And they didn't deem me ill enough to get so much as 1-hr a week. Ultimately I finished all 6 sessions and ended up worse than ever because I realised now I truly had no recourse at all.

What was the next step? Nothing. I was offered nothing. I asked my therapist what happens next and she just had no idea. She had nothing to offer me which was free at the point of use. Honestly thinking back to that I've no idea how I'm still here. I remember actually telling her ""keep an eye out in the papers because honestly you might see my name"". 

Ultimately because I don't have a fixed income **I'm just not worth saving**. In David Camerons Britain I'm a 'skiver', I'm a 'hoody' and I'm not worth the time. I'm not worth the effort. You get depression and you think what everyone says is true, that it's all about 'getting help' but in this country that's fucking bullshit unless your family is providing it or you can pay for it.

I did what you're supposed to do. I told my GP. I got help. And it was a pile of placebo bullshit with a very short expiry date.

Forehead area: review your haircare products, even bubbles/ residues can be an issue for some of us. Mouth area: review your dental care products as /u/stufstuf/ says.

Personally rinsing for hair and mouth products doesn't help me, I completely avoid harsh anionic surfactants (sulphates, olefin sulfonates) but do bear in mind I have skin barrier issues (rosacea, history of eczema).

Other potentially problematic ingredients include silicones and fragrance, not just the surfactants. Almond oil is loaded with oleic acid which is a skin barrier disruptor, penetration enhancer and implicated in comedogenesis (clogging).

If all that does not help you might consult your family doctor, ultimately a prescription retinoid such as adapalene is 'stepping up' from a cosmetic one. Retinoids increase skin turnover and help normalise what goes on inside the pore so reducing clogging.

You have some solid products and active ingredients (niacinamide 4%, vitamin C, retinol, ceramides, acid exfoliants) there, but a lot of products overall. IMO do not add more products but use the ones you have more than once a day - CeraVe PM is fine for AM use, melting gel cleansers should remove make up and sunscreen, and rinse completely clean with water. If not use a muslin cloth, microfibre cloth or konjac sponge.

All your acids (BHA/ AHA/ L-AA) are pH sensitive so should only be used after an acidic cleanser or acidic toner, and have a wait time of at least fifteen minutes after them. Then apply other products. Try to keep niacinamide away from acids, ideally half an hour between. Whilst a CE ferulic product is a solid choice, the [SAP form of vitamin C] (http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionUK/wiki/ingredients/vitamincderivatives) may be better for acne. It is fully compatible with niacinamide and needs no wait times.

Ensure you are consistently meeting or exceeding ALL our government's recommendations for healthy eating and lifestyle. Oily fish - experts recommend up to four servings a week - is particularly important when you are using a high factor sunscreen year round.

An annoying thing happening about once a month is very different from a very dangerous thing happening to you once or more a day. That is the difference between what you described and the experience of cyclists.

Amusing point but I *am* a cyclist. I've been knocked off my bike twice by cars in all my years of cycling. I've been on country lanes and busy city streets. 

That still doesn't make me any less inclined to think some cyclists are tossers when they can't keep their bike in the road and feel the need to come at me on the pavement. 

&gt; Obviously some people will break the law sometimes, but the fact it has happened at all is all you're basically saying - you've seen it happen a very small number of times. So what? That doesn't mean it's happening enormously frequently.

Actually I see cyclists on pavements daily - and I do mean daily. They're all breaking the law. 

I've only mentioned the incidents that have put me at risk of injury with them personally. I couldn't speak for whether they put anyone else in a similar situation daily - but last week I watched one have to do an emergency stop to avoid hitting a mother/pram.

I'm not seriously suggesting it was a police conspiracy - I'm just saying that there are other possibilities and that just automatically placing the blame on the RA because its 'logically the only ones that could do it' is irresponsible. Don't forget the amount of corrupt police here in NI btw - that Country Club no doubt had a lot recently retired RUC men as members did it not?

So, as a fix to error-prone defenders, you want to add another error-prone defender, along side the already error-prone defenders?

&gt; This also means that Walker and Rose will play as wing-backs and that is also perfect because neither of them are great defenders but they are great attackers. They are not afraid to bomb forward and provide width. Especially in the form Walker is in right now, he should not be focusing on defending too much.

They do *exactly* that anyway. They are up and down like yo-yo's. When they do, it's not uncommon to see the CB's press to the half way line, and one holding midfielder to drop back slightly in case of counter. Either Bentaleb or Mason.

&gt; With this formation, Bentaleb can turn into a Gerrard or a Lucas Leiva while Mason can take the role of Henderson

You're basing your entire formation on Liverpool. Why would you do that? They're hardly the perfect model.

&gt; Attack: As we all know, Chadli and Townsend are definitely not Top 4 team players

Oh? I'd say that Chadli is a prime example of a top 4 team player. His input this season has produced massive outputs. Townsend, I can agree, is inconsistent.

&gt; With 3-4-2-1, there will be no need for either one of them and this will allow our record-breaking signing Lamela to showcase his skills in the No.10 role, which I believe his ideal position, alongside Eriksen

I think Eriksen is doing alright by himself. There aren't really any huge problems with our attacking. We've made defensive errors, mostly. 

Overall, I really don't think it matters. This is still a new squad. We have a solution to goal scoring for once, we have a solution to making play tick with Bentaleb, we have a good solution to advanced playmaking and special set pieces with Eriksen, we have Chadli bombing it down the wing and contributing to the goals. 

I think you're being overly critical in a situation where the current setup has got us very far in an otherwise down period.

This attitude makes the situation worse. There are a large amount of minorities doing nothing wrong but happen to live in a rough area.

Nothing says we would need to sell anyone -- just that the number of non-homegrown players registered for the Premier League would have to be reduced.  We could have players not registered and or we could release players, loan players out, etc.

Well, there were ""young"" guys because the majority were either injured, with the U21s, or on international duty.

And for experience too!

Personally, I'd say Josh Cullen could do. And Onariase. Both were on the bench v Arsenal and are massive West Ham fans. Cullen's a Ireland U21 regular, and could be the next Noble. With all the hype around Burke and Oxford, who don't get me wrong are good players, Onariase is kinda underlooked, as is Tunji Akinola. Except Akinola hasn't even signed his scholarship yet, so maybe in a couple of seasons for him!

About 9 weeks ago I submitted my application via post hoping to get a response fairly quickly. Six weeks passed and I had heard nothing, so after an eternity of being on hold to the parking permit department, I still couldn't get through to someone. Eventually I pressed the option for 'blue badge holders' and spoke to a lovely chap who said that my permit application had never even been received. After re-applying by email I got my reference number sent to me within 2 days, where I was able to pay for the permit. However, this was 9 days ago and I still haven't received my permit. After emailing them again today to ask about it, I have been informed that it's been printed again and sent in the post 1st class today... I struggle to believe that the postman had issues delivering both my mail *and* the council's mail, so I would highly recommend chasing it up if it's been a few days since you applied, as there is clearly something wrong with the way these things are being processed.

null,false,frckls29,null,null,null,"Ummm. I might not be too helpful (like in, you might not like my comment), but I don't think you need any stepping up in your routine. In fact, if I were you, I'd simplify it and cut off redundant products, because IMHO, there are many.

1. **Night moisturizer:** I'd choose just one between CeraVe PM and nspa Night Repair Cream. Both have ceramide complex. Although, if all is well (no clogging, irritation, etc.), I'd pick the nspa cream and drop off Kiehl's Midnight Recovery Concentrate (both have natural oils/butters, if that's what you're after; plus too many EO may irritate, but of course YMMV).

2. **BHA:** If morning time BHA works for you, I don't see why you would need Cleanance K as well. BHA works alright daytime and RAL in Triacneal would further clean your pores. I know both have different functions, but I think it's a bit overkill, if not a waste.

3. **AHA:** a weekly peel accompanied with retinoid and more AHA daily is overkill. Your dry forehead may be from overexfoliation. Pick either AHA daily or weekly, but not both. You should also put off using AHA and/or retinoids few days prior and after peel. Plus, you have glycolic, too, in your cleanser. Personally, I'd choose to use Triacneal nightly than weekly peel, but that's just because I'm lazy to do peel every week and doesn't want the frosting, peeling, etc. Weekly peel gives quicker result, but consistent nightly application of AHA will get you there, too. I would also drop the Pixi tonic, too. It's not that cheap, wrong pH for AHA, unless you want it for the hydration.

4. **Day moisturizer:** stufstuf gave great recommendation. I haven't personally tried it (picking my package up at the post office tomorrow), but the ingredients list looks good and it has all those stuff Hydraluron, Vichy Aqualia, Cerave and nspa moisturiser have. You can get that and keep the Kiehl's and layer them at night. With the Simply Pure Hydrating Serum, you can cut 4 products already.

5. **Cleanser:** Personally, I'd pick 1 gentle cleanser to use AM and PM. I wouldn't use any cleanser with active since you've got a lot in topical products already. I personally love Simple KTS Refreshing Wash Gel, but I heard Boots Sensitive foam and gel are great, too.

Again, if I were you, the routine will look something like this

**AM**

* gentle cleanser
* PC 2%BHA liquid
* Simple Soothing Toner or Pixi Glow Tonic 
* Simply Pure Hydrating Serum
* La Roche Posay Hydraphase UV Intense Riche
* La Roche Posay Anthelios SPF50 Dry Touch Gel Cream, if going outside

**PM**

* Garner Micellar Water, for eye makeup removal
* Sweet Almond Oil DIY cleanser
* gentle cleanser
* Simple Soothing Toner
* Active Solutions Vitamin C Serum / Avene Triacneal (alternating nights)
* Simply Pure Hydrating Serum
* Kiehl's Midnight Recovery Concentrate
* Homeoplasmine, if necessary

Actually my original comment is clearly documented that this sub has far too many topics about cycling and a pro-cycling/anti-motorist agenda - as is clearly borne out in this thread. 

All the rest came during various trails of conversation. The evidence is clear to read. 

&gt; Hm... I can't tell if you're victim blaming those in danger using the roads or trying to change the subject to those too scared to use the roads and so cycling (sometimes antisocially) on the pavements - neither is good.

You're right, cycling on the pavement isn't good - it's also illegal. But we didn't get here because I opened my first post on this thread with a comment about cycling on pavements. Again the evidence is there to be read. 

&gt; No, I pointed at why it happens...

From where I'm sitting it looks like an attempt at justification. Certainly it wouldn't be the first or only time someone has tried to take that route. 

Poor road infrastructure does not excuse poor cycling or law breaking. 

&gt; riding on the pavement and some other petty rule breaking 

I can't help but feel you've shown your colours there. To those dodging bicycles as they go down pavements it's not petty. To those dodging cyclists as they run red lights through pedestrian crossings or ignore pelican crossings where cars have stopped: it's not petty. 

As you say, putting others in danger is not justifiable and that's what many cyclists are doing as has happened to me twice in the last two days. 

There's no strawman here. But if you're going to talk of poor infrastructure leading to poor cycling then I'm obliged to kick back with reasons that's no excuse at all. 

If you find yourself caught between poor, dangerous or law breaking cycling and dangerous road infrastructure then get off your bike and walk in safety - the 'compromise' of breaking the law and being a nuisance to others by claiming pavements holds no water with me.

&gt; I'll say it again: Just because something is legal, does not make it a good idea. By riding in the middle of the road at way below the speed limit, you are making it very difficult to pass you, and thus putting yourself at risk. 

That's the point! Taking the primary position removes the temptation to overtake a cyclist when there is no room to overtake. Most of the time a cyclist will be courteous and will move to the left so that it's easier to overtake. If you see a cyclist in the centre of the road it's usually for a good reason!

I shower everyday at least once with Dove shower cream (me and my boyfriend love the creamy smell of either Shea-Vanilla, Hibiscus-Almond or Pistachio-Magnolia) and TBS exfoliating gloves.

Back in the Netherlands, I used to use the body scrub from Sabon in Delicate Jasmine. It smells *heavenly* and makes my skin feels so smooth. Whenever I went out after scrubbing with this, people couldn't stop touching my arms and sniffing me. It's *that* good. It made me and my housemate's shower floor very slippery, though.

I wax my legs and underarms with Veet Sensitive Waxing Strips every two weeks (or every week in summer). I'm curious about epilator, but not sure if it will help folliculitis and ingrowns. BHA toner doesn't help, it just doesn't agree with my skin. I heard shaving with Head and Shoulder shampoo as shaving cream helps with folliculitis and KP, but haven't tried it and too lazy to shave everyday.

I moisturize with Dove Pro-Age Nourishing Lotion, but am wondering if Eucerin 10% Urea would be better.

Me and boyfriend also love Nivea deodorant. He loves the powdery smell one (yes, the one for ladies) and I used to use the whitening one (only available in Asia), but they've got Even Tone here in EU.

I also put a hand/body lotion next to each sink in our apartment. I was looking for Atrixo, but couldn't find it the alst time, so we have Vaseline Essential Moisture with Oat. My hands got so dry and look rough and the cuticles are horrible from all hot-water dishwashing. I also got Cien Hydro Hand Cream from Lidl.

The problem posted was cycle safty from irrisponsible drivers. 

And like i have mentioned before. Every time we have any post about moterist risking the life of cyclist. We get moterists avoiding the responsibility by saying.

But but cyclists do this. 

And the problem is not that big. 

As I have said again and again. Cyclist have issues. It is a relativly small number. As the figures I posted indicated. The % of bad cyclists is lower then the % of bad drivers. 

And the bad drivers kill thousands of padestrians a year. And many many more as a percentage of those who drive. 

So yes every cyclist and every driver needs to take responsibility for thier actions. 

But society as a whole needs to concentrate on the dicks driving arount in a ton of murdering metal before worrying abiut the rare guys on 50lb metal.

First year was really slow and boring so don't worry about that. The first semester of second year included sound theory, practical interaction design and digital video development. Semester 2 in second year is when you can actually choose your modules. The modules I chose were 2D Animation, 3D modelling, and storyboarding.

For me, Digital Media was/is a perfect fit, I've loved the course. I have specialised in advanced 3D modelling, texturing, and 3D animation. My honours project is researching how emotion can be portrayed through 3D character emotion. What I'm meaning to say is that you experience a wide spectrum of digital assets and throughout the course you can shape and decide which routes you want to take.

Liverpool are frustrating but I can understand the wage structure and the effect it might have on the other players, but there should be exceptions, and Raheem fits that bill. He was easily our best player in the first half of the season when everybody else was struggling. He's the Golden Boy winner, he's one of the most tactically aware youngsters I've seen. He's already played well over 100 games for us at 20 years old and is going to grow to be a leader at this club if he stays. 

At this point, it's about respect. Other players who come to the club need to respect him as one of our best players, and he needs to feel that respect is being given to him from the club.

Sterling has a slightly negative public perception, but he works as hard as anybody else on the pitch. He gets popped into 3 different positions during the same match and just goes about his business. You think he enjoys playing wing back? He gets hacked down all the time but never complains, and he's simply one of our best players.

What happens if we have to sign Raheem's replacement? Are we going to pay him 150k to hopefully do what Raheem surely could have?

Liverpool have to pay him, they just have to. We can't buy young potential and expect that to mean that we won't ever have to deal with lucrative contracts b/c they're young. We've bought potential, Sterling has more than fulfilled it up to this point and should be rewarded for that.

In terms of helping him, it sounds like he absolutely needs it. I don't know enough about these things to know if he will be able to recover alone. He sounds like someone in serious need of help.

I really, really think you should speak to a therapist about this. I know you don't want to get him 'locked up' if you can avoid it, but what could happen otherwise? I know going to someone and telling on your brother who trusts only you will be hard, probably the hardest thing you could do. But he needs a professional.

I agree, we really need to address our starting RB/RWB position. Flanno, if healthy, will be a great backup/competitor as will Manquillo. I think we just need to add some depth at the position and get a few quality players competing for the spot

This is a big part of the counter-argument: efficiency. It *is* to an extent ideological (both sides are) but there are also sensible economic arguments involved. 

Cuts are definitely a bad idea when everyone is doing it at the same time (at the macro and micro level) but they can be managed well too, for instance by having more luck with timing and the various other factors at play. This isn't an exact science so it's not hard to also make the argument that cuts can be good in the longer term. It's just hard to say with a lot of certainty either way -- it's all about how the overall picture shapes out. 

Regarding the rich etc running around... well they would do well regardless. Either way it boils down to a supply side or demand side emphasis. 

But if you want to pay more yourself, then go for it! As far as I'm aware there is no law against it, you could even encourage others to do the same for more effect. Alternatively save what you make from the tax cuts so you can invest it later.

She defines EVERYTHING in these terms and sees the ""solutions"" as being in giving extra to some to make up for discrimination, undoubtedly seeing it as leveling the playing field. She never seeks a way for the field to be level in the first place.

In actual fact, there aren't places on the road where you shouldn't walk; you may cross where you please. Holding up traffic may be rude, but there's no law against that (at least in moderation). Relevant instructions: https://www.gov.uk/rules-pedestrians-1-to-35/crossing-the-road-7-to-17

When crossing near a light-controlled crossing, using the crossing is ideal, and waiting for the light is safest, but you don't appear to be under any obligation to do either. The closest I could find to guidance is the The Zebra (etc.) Crossings Regulations (http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1997/2400/part/I/made), which states fairly clearly that traffic given permission to pass the crossing ""shall proceed with due regard to the safety of other road users"", a category into which people walking across the road definitely fall.

(Of course, if you just step out into the road, and somebody hits you with their car, the fact you weren't crossing at a designated place will probably make it rather your fault. (Though - there's a good argument that in areas where this would be possible, you should drive more slowly in order to avoid injury should it happen.) Nevertheless, you won't get into any additional trouble because of it.)

A lot of the issues you've highlighted are things we considered, I'd agree that the biggest issue is having to install the plugin. We hope to get around this when WebGL is fully integrated within unity and allow us to build + distribute without the need for any installation on the users part. For now, in terms of web deployment this is the best unity has to offer and the plugin is guaranteed to be completely safe for your computer.  

We actually do have a standalone version, which we've used for demo purposes, but we didn't really think it was something people would want to download given its size and risk of downloading an exe. We'll consider putting the link up to download that now though.

The loading time is something I'm looking into. The reason for it is that all of the artwork etc is loaded at the start. A better approach would be an asynchronous load while the user is free to explore the space. I'm currently looking into a way of implementing it nicely.

Again, we appreciate the feedback. You've raised some good points.

null,false,Cast_Me-Aside,null,null,null,"&gt;I wonder how this even happens. 

About eight years ago HMRC did Butlins for minimum wage failures.

The gist of what happened was this:  Butlins paid its staff pretty close to minimum wage.  If they lived on-site in subsidised accomodation *(I don't recall whether living on-site was mandatory)* Butlins deducted costs from their pay-slip.  Because the deductions were made before payment, this reduced the hourly pay below NMW.

There are two things that are interesting about this...  One is that the individual underpayments were low, but the total underpayments were in the millions.  The other is that it would have been entirely legal if the pay had been made without deduction and the expense was separately invoiced.  In effect it was the implementation, rather than the charge that made it illegal.

It's also the sort of thing an employer can shrug off pretty easily.  On the one hand it seems *(to me)* that it's a bit douchey to pay minimum wage and then also try to recover costs from your employees, but on the other the fact is they were providing subsidised housing.  After all, it's completely legal to employ someone and leave them to figure out how to pay their rent.

Additionally, the net effect to the employee if the expense were invoiced to them in nil.

Edit:

A **[source](http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-1607305/Butlins-workers-get-1m-in-back-pay.html)** for the Butlins NMW violation.

The charge appears to have been a flat £3 per week.

Something about this I had forgotten is this:

&gt;'This ruling applies even if alternative arrangements cost employees more than the standard £3 per week deduction.'

This is the problem with a case like this.  It's probable that if it costs the employer more to implement something properly they're going to transfer that cost.  It might be fitting meters, it might be employing someone to invoice the cost.  But in the end you potentially have someone with less money in their pocket, so their wage slip says they were paid more.",null,0,null,1427230255,null,0,1427230544,0,cpphtbh,null,t3_30454e,null,t1_cpphtbh,null,t1_cpoxyfl,null,null,null,1431991691,null,1,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,1,null

The problem is, to an outsider, it's mind boggling at times.  Also, speaking as someone filling that significant other role in a past life, it starts to affect us in a way that is destructive, we question every action we take.  Are we making it worse, are we enabling, are we provoking are we being inactive?  It becomes daunting.  Experience tells us that we can't be passive, but being active also creates problems.

Mental illness often can be presented as just a bad attitude.  In one case, which funnily I was talking about with a friend at the weekend, I failed to comprehend how someone could behave, the phrase *learned helplessness* was thrown into the mix.  I'm not exactly normal (I've ed psych reports from my uni days detailing quite thoroughly why) but I couldn't comprehend how someone would think that a little plush toy, would be spying on them.  I mean, I just asked, why not put it in the microwave for 10 seconds?  The person in question was a very good physicist so the idea must have occurred.  The fact is, part of the illness manifests to an outsider as an almost willful desire to suffer.

It isn't that people are judging you, for many that won't be the case.  But please don't blame us for not being able to comprehend why you react so differently, in a manner we can't foresee.

*It combines Norwegian Formula moisture with active minerals, which help boost skin’s own collagen production*\*.

*For visibly smoother and more supple skin. With a fast absorbing texture that leaves a delicately scented and soft after‐feel.*

**About you:** Easily tanned hands, dried out by excessive paper handling due to work.

**Your opinion:** I'm not sure I can be unbiased about this hand cream, it straight up smells like Veet without the chemical side so it was hate on first application.

I really enjoyed working with children who were often very gifted in a certain intellect, whilst lacking in others, it's been an accusation I've had thrown my own way too, maybe that's why I'm tolerant of such things.

The problem with CBT, as you say, is it will only work for certain types of people, those it doesn't have the 'wrong attitude' which is basically, their illness.

However, that doesn't for a second mean it's wrong to try.  The attitude towards not trying it, because *you've already done it* is precisely why my GP (who is brilliant) often rips on me.  A few weeks back, he used his favourite phrase *Mr TheAnimus, you often have to put up with lay people in your job, with that little bit of knowledge that is so dangerous, they try to skip steps, they think they know precisely what is wrong, I bet it irritates you*, this was because he wasn't happy to prescribe me more prednisone for my asthma,  to be used at my discretion.  The reason I value my GP for that so much, people are often intimidated into doing what I wish, I'm tall, eloquent as my speech isn't impacted by dyslexia, it's apparent that I'm rather gifted, call it ENTJ, so I really do need people to stand up to me, when my little knowledge is a danger, because so frequently in life, it isn't.  It took me far too long to learn in life, being surrounded by people who stand up to me, who make me do things I consider pointless, is one of the most useful things.

As a result, please don't think you know it all, sure CBT appears stupid, it is, but so is meditation, and like that, it only works if you go in with an open enough mind.

Clinging to symbolism for their identity and playing dress up. ""When I put this uniform on I feel the weight of duty on my shoulders"". What duty is that, exactly?

Shit anecdotes too, like that guy saying that when he walked into a hall full of UDR memorials he had made ""the best decision of my life""(!) or the guy who said his family went to the USA for a holiday but he wouldn't go because he wouldn't miss the Twalfth... and he wasn't even in a band at that stage! 

What can we take from this? That the guy is so small minded that he won't even take a holiday to see a world outside of Norn Iron, he stubbornly wants to stay for the same little self-obsessed annual festival, so what, he can feel ""proud""? Are we meant to respect him for that? 

I didn't understand what the context to this was exactly. A load of 'proud' Protestant boys get together to make some amateur production about the 1st world war. Why do we not see the performance at any length? Was it that bad?

Why were there no women in the program whatsoever? What does this stay about the ""PUL community"" and women's roles?

By the way, the statements on shared future seemed forced and were few and far between. I counted about two, carefully edited soundbites in the entire show. Anything about themmuns being respected too was minimal and glib, used as a justification for them being able to march wherever they want to all the time. Sure the guys said that Catholics died in WW1 but they used that just to justify the existing celebrations of the First World War as defence of empire, queen and country etc. No mention of the fact that many thought that they were doing it in exchange for a united Ireland.

These were not bastions of inter-cultural exchange and nor would you expect them to be, hanging around paramilitary murals, sticking bunting all over their trees, even wearing tshirts which were red white and blue... Did any of them say they had any Catholic friends? No... Were there any of themmuns in the program, even for a second? No... Was there any concerted effort to actually engage with Irish culture or nationalism in this program? No.

I understand this was about the loyalist band 'scene', it would have been interesting to see if they could get someone from a republican band to see what, if anything, they had in common. But maybe the lads didn't want to actually *meet* any taigs.

If the rules force the clubs to actually nurture English talent from academy to loan to first team place, will be good.
