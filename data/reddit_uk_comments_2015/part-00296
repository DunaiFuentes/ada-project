It was bleedingly obvious to pretty much everyone that we lacked a proper CDM last season, which is a huge part of why our defensive record was so poor.  We supposedly now have a sophisticated scouting system with a team of people dedicated solely to player recruitment... in other words, the opening of the transfer window doesn't and shouldn't represent when we as a club *start* thinking about what players we need.  We should have a list of achievable, affordable players ready to go, so that 9am Day 1 of the transfer window, bids are ready to be lodged.

Obviously, whether those bids are successful or not is another story, but delaying purchases have only hurt us in the past, never helped.  Trying to squeeze deals for a million or two less, or waiting until deadline day and trying to get some rushed deals, smacks of being penny-wise, pound foolish.

I'm sure every coach would like to go into a preseason with a full squad, let alone the actual season itself.  I just don't see how any targets are going to suddenly identify themselves in the next month that we couldn't have known about earlier and could've already been deep in negotiations with.

It's created an environment where I can't imagine business will be keen to invest in Scotland, and I certainly can't see the current government in any rush to spend on big infrastructure projects North of the border after all the ""beggar thy neighbour"" independence rhetoric we heard from the SNP.

Ignoring the obvious (Kane, Lloris) I expect a young Algerian by the name Nabil Bentaleb to really push on this year. His forward distribution and passing range is top drawer. While more of a classic CM we've seen his skills grow from the 21 year old that Sherwood baptized by fire in Tactic's wild ride of a season, into a player that can woke both sides of the ball. Personally, I want a classic DM to play alongside Bentaleb so the man can be free to press higher up the pitch.  Bentaleb is tenacious in tackle and has a shot that I reckon will find the net a couple times this season. His first touch is emasculate and he is so calm and collected under pressure. He is also incredibly versatile: delivering a fantastic cross for Kane's header in the 2-1 win against Arsenal and also filling in at LB very well in the last game of the past season. Bentaleb is a fantastic young player that will fills a void we've been missing since Modric and I look forward to his progression this season.

The US has similar regulations in some industries, like car emissions and electrical safety standards, but in things like food and agriculture they're not even close to compatible. 

Also the level of ISDS the US wants is far far greater than already exists within the EU, so at the moment (for example), if I own a UK company and I make a deal to sell my GM corn to the Hungarian prison service for ten years, and then Hungary makes GM corn illegal to feed prisoners then I can't sue Hungary. But with  the proposed deal, if I was a US company, I would be able to sue Hungary using the ISDS provisions. Obviously it all depends on what happens in the negotiation, but that example is a very likely scenario.  So then do we bring in ISDS into the EU? Or do we give the US extra legal powers? Or do we negotiate to reduce the ISDS provisions. Well the US has ruled out the latter, and the first two are pretty shitty. 

There are lots of other things like this in it, and given that a lot of countries get a veto and a lot of countries don't like it, I mean, it might go through eventually, but when it does I expect it will be very watered down.

It's more a case of poor regulation than de-regulation. Some people have presented the argument that Basel II's asset requirements incentivised the holding of mortgage debt, there was obviously a degree of failure in the broad regulatory structure, capital and liquidity requirements weren't sufficient, et cetera et cetera.

Overall, the financial system was put in a weak position by the aforementioned issues, but it wasn't the cause of the Recession. It was, most likely, triggered by underlying weaknesses in the economy--a result of poor monetary policy, high amounts of leverage among both households and the financial sector and (in the US) the consumption shock from the crash in house prices.

There's some evidence for structural issues caused by regulation in the economy, as well as possibly a mis-aligned productivity boom but I don't think they have much explanatory power.

Most economists agree that, if anything, the repeal of Glass-Steagall helped the financial system weather the Recession better. Glass-Steagall had the effect of weakening banks by making them undiversified.

With that to one side, Corbyn is simply [a populist.](http://image.slidesharecdn.com/suvivirsi-45min-140717001610-phpapp02/95/populism-as-politics-of-personal-experience-the-case-of-suvivirsi-16-638.jpg?cb=1405556265) This doesn't make you credible or somehow inherently bolster democracy. Nor does it intrinsically testify to the soundness of what you are claiming to be able to provide. 

&gt; And it is winning that requires a range of skills in coalition-building, in political manoeuvrability, and in crafting a narrative which is both suitably empty (so that all positions can be contained within it) and robust (so that there is a narrative identity to hawk)

This is simply a distortion of the aim. It may seem empty to the author, but in reality it is unifying and not divisive -- it captures a wider range of opinion and moderates it accordingly. 

Most people don't understand the implications or intricacies of implementing any given policy, and [are actually quite moderate in their views](http://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2013/06/03/187589613/the-illusion-of-political-understanding) (unless of course, some priestly figure offers them the world and more, how they can make a better life for 'the people' given how terrible the current state of affairs *truly* is...).

The author has a point insofar as [centrism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrism) lends itself to attacks of blandness and being unprincipled, but personally I believe this misses the point. The aim is to get people to come together for the sake of progress, borrowing the best from all sides and angles regardless of illogical and mechanical ideological devotion. 

Of course, if you're fighting purely for ideological gain, and some pre-conceived notion of what is pure, or what is true, then naturally an ideology that places compromise and a bipartisan acceptance of other views as valid and central to progress will seem unprincipled, bland or 'watered down.'

He was voted to be the captain by the players and he had a bit of reputation, so Poch figured he needs to give him a chance. Kaboul, however, didn't cut it:

He started every single game until November, and he was not Kaboul of the old days. Just face it, he was fine, but he was the weakest link in our defense. If you are gonna have a weak link in your defense, it is better that it is a 19 year old hungry player that will develop, rather than it to be a damaged 29 year old that is losing pace. Kaboul finally got dropped after the horrible 2-1 loss to Newcastle at home. 

So you really don't think being a regular starter for 3 months straight is enough of a chance to prove you are worthy of a place in the team or not. 

If Poch followed your guidelines we would be playing Soldado up-front still, because 3 months of starting games is not enough to judge a player on.

&gt;More nonsense.

Lennon has been great for us. But Poch can't build a team on a player that was great in 2006 and 2012. He needs a winger that can deliver now.

I get that £20M is a lot for a defender, but he's 26 and Rodgers probably believes he can get a good few years service out of him. It doesn't definitively mean that Rodgers does not rate Sakho, but more likely he's concerned by his injury record and knows that we need a stable partnership at the back. 

&gt; Same as he did with Borini and Allen

That's not how the refugee system is supposed to work. In an ideal world, refugees apply for asylum in the first safe country they reach, and then they are distributed across multiple countries. The guarantee is *protection*, not a choice of where you get settled. In this world Britain would take a fair share of the refugees, as would France, Germany, the US etc.

I think the issue is that people don't understand why someone who is fleeing for their life would find it so unacceptable to live in France. Learning a new language is not *that* hard. If I had the choice of returning to certain death in my home country or learning French, I could probably pick up a bit of French.

The answer shouldn't be let Southern Europe deal with the problem. And I agree that we have a duty to help the refugees of wars we (at least in part) started. But it's hard not to see these people as abusing the system when they reject France in favour of breaking their way illegally into the UK.",null,0,null,1438467855,null,null,false,0,ctoapeu,null,t3_3fecy8,null,null,null,t1_cto52n2,null,null,null,1440225874,null,21,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,21,null

If you take his most recent comments at face value he literally hasn't decided who will play CB against Stoke which means Sakho IS in contention. 

As everyone seems to know, Sakho has been better than Lovren... Brendan isn't an idiot, he will know this too. His other comments today, about needing more stability in our defensive selection can really only be a direct comment about injuries disrupting his team selection too much. Sakho has easily had more injuries than anyone else in our defense, so this comment is almost certainly directed at Sakho. 

Therefore I think we can conclude that Brendan would like to use Sakho, but he's concerned with his injury record. If he doesn't think Sakho will remain injury free he'd prefer to use Lovren, long term, to minimize disruption. This is why he hasn't decided who he would like to use against Stoke yet.

null,null,Thesladenator97,null,null,null,"Well as an eye witness, I can say from my veiwpoint the planes were VERY close to the ground, maybe 20-40ft above tree height tops? From where I was it looked like he attempted to get up after the stunt at a fairly steep angle, then the plane plummeted. The pilot did well to get it into the trees, I was so sure it had crashed closer to the park than it did. Maybe the engines failed? The commentator of the display talked about how the owner of the planes has been rebuilding them to fly as show planes, they'd been looking for funding to strip and rebuild a 4th one. So whether it was just the shell that was original I don't know. 

I don't know what happened, we were told that the planes were flying very low to the ground due to limited airspace at the time - they were late to the display because they were waiting for permission to fly. 

So all we can do is wait, though I would not be surprised if flying as low as they were caused engine failure or something. As from where I was stood it looked like it just couldn't get back up from the dip it had taken after the stunt, though i guess mechanical failure would cause that anyway. 

Its horrific really the whole thing, and it happened in less than a minute and the smoke wasn't constant, it was there in a big ball then gone the next, I hope it had a black box so they can find out what happened. 

Though I do see it was foolish of me to say the issue isn't mechanical when it probably was.

As I understand it the GM plants generally don't produce viable seeds, and certainly don't produce seeds with the same properties as the GM crop, this is why GMOs are so great for corporations. 

So, for example if you're an african farmer you either get your crops from monsanto and every year you pay them a load of money and get some seeds or you use traditional crops, keep some of the seeds and buy some to make up the difference from a variety of sources every year. If you use the GM crops then you get bigger yields (this is a good thing), and don't have to rotate your crops (sort of a good thing...bigger yields) and can swamp your ground with roundup, this means you can only carry on growing the GM crops, which is fine, until monsanto decide that they're going to increase their seed prices, and now you have no option but to keep on buying from them. There are hundreds of other scenarios I'm sure you can imagine [this is a good article on why africa is rejecting GMO](http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/10/17/2787921/african-countries-join-anti-monsanto-protests/). 

What I'd like to see is a non-profit organisation set up, similar to CERN but for GM, which works to develop GMOs for the good of the world's population, not for profit. Until that happens I cannot see GMOs being good for the world, which is a shame as they have the potential to be incredible.

There are also issues with GMOs reducing biodiversity. If the whole world uses a type of crop dependent on one trait and then some disease comes along that affects that trait, then it could become a huge ecological disaster/global famine. 

So basically GMOs aren't inherently bad, but they're also not the answer to everything and they're controlled by corporations who don't care about their ""potential to save millions more lives"", they just care about how much money they can make from them.",null,0,null,1438468445,null,null,1438471570,0,ctoazcq,null,t3_3fer6b,null,null,null,t1_ctoa2m2,null,null,null,1440226004,null,2,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Compare this to Jeremy Corbyn (or even Sturgeon or Salmond of SNP), whose political views are much more opposed to the Tories/the Government and yet they are far more successful in what they do. People in this country value (largely, I still believe) someone who is strong-willed over populist. Look at Clegg, he did very well in 2010 when he presented his side well &amp; defended his position and yet in May he was just saying that he wasn't as 'spineless' as a Tory or as 'financially stupid' as a Labourite and he got laughed out the building.

Even as a conservative supporter I enjoy watching debates involving the likes of Sturgeon or Salmond, and much prefer the prospect of a Labour PM in Corbyn than the 3 failed Tory politicians he's running against.

I have nothing against Balo personally but as a striker he wasn't performing for Liverpool. The kids got a lot of talent and will land on his feet somewhere it would be a shame for him to be on the bench all season and paying his high wages hurts the team. That's why Liverpool are trying to force him out. It's business. 

As to why we didn't force Sterling or Lambert out, again it was a money decisions. City wouldn't have coughed up the 49 mil if Liverpool mad it clear that they didn't want him. That would've devalued him. Same for Lambert. 

I was excited for Balotelli but it just wasn't working and the team have made the decision that it's not worth continuing with him. Players who are not performing to a clubs standards are let go and it shouldn't be taken so personally. The same thing happens at all other clubs that's basically pro football.

Yes they're in France, but France has already taken in a lot of migrants, so have other EU countries - way more than we have, **the ones at Calais are the ones France can't afford or won't take in, they're our share of the migrants**. The 'home' they've been given in Calais in the camp is nicknamed 'the jungle' and has appalling conditions.

Bloody hell, mate. You talk of ignorance and then write this piffle.

The reason that many African migrants want to get England is that they have a sense that life will be better than if they stay in France. Partly this is because many of them speak some English, but no French. It is also because the British labour market is better for them than the French one. An FT piece also quoted some saying the British welfare system was more generous, which is probably untrue but may be a genuine perception they have.

You are correct that the British are eschewing their share of the burden, but the failure to handle the migration crisis engulfing Africa and the Middle East is European rather than merely British.

Foodies is ENORMOUS in comparison, and this year it's meant to be 50% bigger than it used to be too apparently.  It's got a good selection of street food, many of which are touring with it so they're not local and you wont have had them.  There's a good selection of booze of different types.  Pretty solid program of celebrity chefs and demonstrations and stuff, and a fairly big vendor's market with everything from stalls selling Jams and preserves, to Mail-order meal subscriptions, via Coffee Machine sellers. 

The Food Festival uses the space Assembly/The Spiegeltent use during the festival at George Square - they had maybe a dozen street food places, most of which were local businesses (a lot of these were shut on Thursday even though it was only like 6pm though).  They only had a couple of market stall situations and these were all shut/shutting when I was there.  Their booze is the standard Assembly Festival bar which is quite limited.  They have a program of food talks/debates and some performances later in the evening from Fringe acts - but the performances cost money.

Foodies is obviously bigger and has a lot more to offer, but I've always thought it's a bit shit that you have to pay to get in, since you then have to buy everything once you're in there - the tickets are quite expensive considering they literally just buy your entry and nothing else.  If you've got free tickets it's absolutely worth checking out.

null,null,myfootballaccount,rangers,,null,"&gt; But a lot of the breakdown between Rangers and the BBC seems to be that the BBC aren't covering Rangers in they way that Rangers expect to be covered.

Can you explain what you mean here?

As I wrote elsewhere:

I would argue that Rangers fans do have reason to feel antagonised by elements within BBC Sport Scotland following a number of incidents:

- [The deliberate editing of an interview with Ally McCoist to try to make it look like he laughing when the issue of sectarianism within the Old Firm was being discussed.](http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/bbc-apologise-to-rangers-for-inappropriate-edit-1108942)
- [The montage of the Rangers manager falling out of a window](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/rangers/9572348/Rangers-launch-formal-complaint-over-BBCs-tasteless-Mad-Men-montage.html)
- BBC Radio presenters calling Ally McCoist ""Fat Sally"". (see previous link)
- Uploading an image to the BBC website with the word hun in the metadata -- don't have time to find a citation
- [BBC staff using the word hun to describe Rangers fans](http://www.therangersstandard.co.uk/index.php/articles/current-affairs/170-is-bbc-scotland-biased-against-rangers)

Taken individually, each of these can be brushed off as a poor judgement by those involved. However, when a pattern emerges over time, how are Rangers fans not meant to feel antagonised?

edit:

Also, Rangers didn't ban the BBC -- they removed the press privileges of one of their journalists. He can still buy a ticket, he just won't receive any hospitality available to the press.

Whilst I don't feel that this is unwarranted, the way it has been handled by Rangers has been sloppy. They should either have done it silently and kept correspondence between themselves and the BBC or made a press release stating their reasons for doing so -- at the moment, only those who have been following closely will be aware of these reasons. Instead the news seems to have been leaked on twitter and there hasn't been any official word from the club to my knowledge.

edit2:

&gt; ""We banned the BBC because we don't like what they said. Please investigate why they don't say what we want them to say.""

Clubs can have a legitimate issue with the integrity of a journalist's reporting that provides justification for revoking their press privileges.

It should be noted that Rangers are neither the first nor the only Scottish club to have banned individual journalists. ",null,0,null,1438472646,null,null,1438474001,0,ctoczx3,null,t3_3fexvh,null,null,null,t1_ctobkol,null,null,null,1440227013,null,8,null,ScottishFootball,t5_2sba4,8,null

null,null,Batcatsheep,null,null,null,"The parent comment was basing his negative judgment on Lovren off of preseason and i was just trying to disprove that. 

To comment on your point; Lovren didn't play particularly well last season. My opinion of him is that his general play on the ball is actually very good. He distributes the ball very well, doesn't often buckle under pressure when someone is closing him down. 

I agree with you though that he makes a lot of big mistakes, which unfortunately stands out when looking at his overall performance. 

However, he is not alone in doing that. Almost everyone in the backlane have made several individual mistakes leading to a goal. This is just me arguing that Lovren shouldn't take all the blame, and that maybe all the individual mistakes are the symptom of some greater issue, whether it be defensive miscommunication or  a weak mentality within the team.

Furthermore (And this is just my perspective), this subs behaviour towards Lovren after that Malaysia game was absolutely appaling.

Hey, i get that there is nothing wrong with criticizing a player if he's had a bad game, but many of the comments i saw were beyond that. It's almost as the writers of those comments hated and loathed him, and i dont think its the right way to treat a LFC player. YNWA means fuck all, if people on this sub continue like this.

He was born a millionaire. But he was the only kid of a minor wife. His other brothers probably had much bigger say and a brighter future in the family business than he did. So he probably grew up a rebel already who didn't much like rich people and found emotional refuge in an severely austere life.

In fact, the TARDIS blew up for the exact opposite reason you state (i.e. They wanted to stop the Doctor from reaching trenzalore to release the Time Lords, as opposed to the Time Lords doing to to let him). This is backed up by the voice in the TARDIS, during the blowing up, saying the Church/Kovarian Chapters ""Silence will fall"" chant.

In addition. Your evidence a is the wrong way round. The End of Time in Gallifrey's timeline was the final day, sure, but this clearly takes place before the Day of the Doctor's events, which show the Dalek's final attack on the city and the banishment of Gallifrey from the universe (again, backed up by the War Council stating ""Their plans have already failed.

Which has always been a problem, but something we've looked to be working on this pre season is breaking down teams that do exactly that so even if we are poor on set pieces defensively we can break them down. 

Man City scored 20 fewer goals and didn't win the title. We won't ever be as good as Chelsea defensively who are the base team so for me scoring goals should be a priority over defending in my opinion.

Set piece defending does come the training ground and I think we should look to stop them as much as possible (obviously). ",null,0,null,1438474851,null,null,false,0,ctoe2mm,null,t3_3ffh5i,null,null,null,t1_ctod4m2,null,null,null,1440227587,null,2,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null

1st cycle light: 0 seconds (green)

2nd cycle light: 21 seconds

3rd cycle light: 24 seconds

4th cycle light: 43 seconds

5th cycle light: 30 seconds

So the average is 23 seconds per bicycle light. The longest movement will be a right turn where you have to go through two of these exit crossing cycle traffic lights, and cycling between each one takes ~11 seconds each, so the worst case scenario is 11 seconds cycling + 43 second red light + 11 seconds cycling + 30 second red light = approx 1 minute, 35 seconds to get through the junction, plus the red light time at the entrance to the junction.

&gt; Well, I'm convinced /s

Chill out, this isn't a courtroom. It was a quickly compiled list with some links for further reading pulled off the first hits from google. It's not like I keep a database on this stuff.

&gt; something for which the BBC have apologised

The BBC have actually apologised for a number of these incidents. That they felt the need to apologise suggests that they must have done something wrong. My point is that when the individual incidents become a chain of incidents then there is an issue.

&gt; the presenters of a comedy show doing, well, comedy,

Comedy can be antagonistic.

&gt; What this is is confirmation bias. you want the BBC to be biased against Rangers so all you look for is stuff that proves it then claim it's true.

I never mentioned the word biased. I gave a list of things that happened and said suggested that these might be reasons for Ranger's fans feeling antagonised by people that work for BBC Scotland but whatever you say.

&gt; And, Rangers did ban the BBC. You may not want to see it that way, but if you remove the press privileges of not one but two BBC journalists, it's a ban.

I don't think your logic checks out.

So asking one BBC Journalist not to attend is the same as ""banning"" the whole BBC?

When Celtic banned Hugh Keevins does that mean they ""banned"" the whole Daily Record? 

When Dundee ""banned"" Jim Spence does that mean they ""banned"" the whole BBC as well?

&gt; Rangers expect the media to cover Rangers in a certain way. The BBC hasn't been doing that. So, the BBC get banned for reporting the news rather than Rangers fluff

So I guess the same applies to Celtic and Dundee then when they asked journalists not to attend their matches? Or could it be that clubs sometimes have issues with the integrity of a journalists reporting and feel that the only recourse they have is to ask that they do not attend?

null,null,myfootballaccount,rangers,,null,"&gt;&gt;So asking one BBC Journalist not to attend is the same as ""banning"" the whole BBC? When Celtic banned Hugh Keevins does that mean they ""banned"" the whole Daily Record?

&gt; Except that's exactly how that was portrayed when the Keevins ban happened.

I'm not sure what your point is? How was it portrayed this way? Do you agree or disagree with this portrayal, as you seem to be using it to support your argument? Like, does this portrayal somehow set a precedent in your head meaning that when a club ""bans"" a journalist, they are somehow also banning their entire employer?

&gt; The fact is that Rangers don't get to decide who the BBC sends to cover the club

If a club feels they have a legitimate issue with the conduct of an individual reporter, are they not within their right to ask that they do not attend their matches? As I mentioned, Celtic, Dundee, and likely many more clubs have taken similar steps. It seems a bit simplistic to say that clubs shouldn't have a say in who they welcome in their doors. Whether or not you feel each of these clubs is justified in taking these actions is your own prerogative.

&gt; is the club deciding who covers the club. Simply because they don't like what the journalist in question said.

No. The club aren't trying to, nor can they, stop a journalist from covering them. They are simply saying they aren't welcome to the privileges normally afforded to the press.

The Keevings thing is simple.  Celtic banned him, it was portrayed as the club banning the paper.  Not entirely sure where you are confused about that.

Rangers, Aberdeen, Peterhead, whoever it is are perfectly free to ask that certain journalists do not cover them.  That's fine.  When the newspaper/broadcaster in question decides they want that person to cover the club and the club then decide to deny them access, that is banning the organisation.

Yes I had my son when I was 15 (turned 16 a month later). That doesn't matter though. He has always been well cared for and loved.

What we did for fun has nothing to do with it. At least im getting help and it doesn't affect my family like drugs or alcohol would.

His nursery teachers where the people who originally noticed a problem but I didnt want to believe it. Then his health visitor mentioned adhd a while later but its very difficult to diagnose. For a while during his pediatrician appointments they where almost sure and where talking about medication and counselling. When he went to c.a.m.s. (sp?) They told us it wasn't.  We where confused but happy. After more appointments we know its not adhd but he does have some behaviour they want to keep an eye on (ticks etc. ) we are very happy with the progress he is making and while we work together with therapists and his teacher we can see some improvement. Our next pediatrician appointment will be next year to review but with the work we are doing we think that he will be on track.

Theres no easy way to put this so il be as blunt as you have been. His dad beat me. Thats why im not with him. Cafcass advised us on supervised visits when they heard in the police report (just what happens when you go to court for access) that he had locked me and my son out of the house when my son was 6 months old. He refused to let me collect his milk, nappies and clothes but luckily my sister has a daughter who was 3 months old then so I lent some milk and nappies and stayed there until the police got my keys back.

Yup I met my husband at a tattoo parlour. It was also on a day when there was a 2 for 1 offer. Guess im cheep and trashy lol. Its not like I jumped his bones that day though, thats just the first place we seen each other. We talked a lot on Facebook (moved to texts and calls obviously) and become great friends. He was always there for me whenever I needed a friend. I started to fall for him and luckily for me he felt the same way. We started going out and its been bliss ever since. We are a sickeningly happy couple but its how we work. 

As for the last part I did explain that the other people dont bother me wich youve already read. I just wish he would trust me enough to tell me about them. 

Anything else you'd like to mention or drag up from my past random Internet stranger? Im sure you can dig up another post about how I kicked a puppy at age 3 or something. Honestly all of this makes no difference to my situation.

null,null,Serex123,null,null,null,"No they don't. Its bullshit. 'Call centre staff' are tax trained and have the ability to change and issue a code during the call. How do I know this? Because I used to work in a HMRC contact centre. If someone is telling people to ask payrol to change the code then that person isn't doing their job, and with all the checks in place that person would eventually have to change or they'd be sacked. If it does happen then its not common practice and i've personally not witnessed that happening. I'd say about 70 per cent of calls are about PAYE, with about 70 per cent of those calls a cosing issue. Thats a lot of calls and a lot of coding change. It is the basic work, and a single contact centre advisorIs probably going to change at least a dozen customer's codes during any one working day. And changing a code can take anything from a few seconds in sinple cases to over an hour with complex customers. To even suggest that contact cebtre advisors are telling people that their payrol is responsible for calculating the code is ridiculous.

Staff may advise an employee to contact their payroll to check whether or not they have recieved a code, to get information like a fax number if that has 't happened, and sometimes to ask  whether they can re-run that employees payrol so they don't have to wait another fortnight or another month before the correct code is implemented. 'Call centre staff' issue codes with an electronic P6 (a paper p2 wikl get sent to the custoner's address with a change in code). The P6 is an instruction to change the code. If necessary, contact centre staff can fax codes and even on occassion send them through the post. Contact Centre Statf are fully aware that payrol staff do not have the authority to change codes without instruction. Its drilled into them. They will advise customer's of this if the customer statss they have changed codes without notification. HMRC can even launch investigations into unauthorised changes in codes. Payrol staff are often fired, even prosecuted, for taking liberties.

I'm not turning this into a HMRC v payrol fight, but from experience its usually payrol blaming their fuck ups on HMRC and not the other way around. I've lost count of the tines I've spoken to the customer who has been told to ring HMRC by an incompetant payrol team member who has fucked up. Even simple things like ignoring a wk1 and putting someone on a cunulative code can cause a perosn financial hardship. HMRC only acts on the information it is provided, and automatic and manual checks are in place to reduce coding errors to a minimum. With RTI incorrect coding is even rarer. Most incorrect codes are in relation to company benefits, and 99.9 per cent of the time because the P11d is wrong or because the customer hasn't been given the correct information. These are just examples. HMRC has checks in place. payrol teams often don't (which is disturbing given the power they have).

As for waiting times, thats what you get when thousands of people are at any given tine trying to call an understwffed department that has people spread over multiple lines of business. Calls disconnect because centres are at full capacity and the existing waiting lines are already very long. If the call connects its to save you time and money. Lots of organisations do it, albeit ones that get tens of thousands of call every day. Its not like the phones are ringing but no one can be arsed to pick them up. I'm no longer a contact centre advisor, but I alpreciate the work they do, the stress and pressure they are under, and the complete and itter lack of recognition they get for doing a hard job.

**Star of the Season:** Lloris, Alderweireld or Kane (hopefully both). Lloris is always fantastic. Alderweireld showed high promise during the MLS-ASG, and Kane might not have as prolific of a season (might be missing out on EL goals) but will still produce nicely. Lamela, Eriksen, and Chadli will also do quite well.

I can't speak to his popularity as a DJ with Radio Luxembourg, but Savile presented the first *Top of the Pops* in 1964, and *Jim'll Fix It* from 1975 to 1994. Channel 4 didn't launch until 1982, and Channel 5 until 1997.

I can't remember exactly what time *Jim'll Fix It* aired, but I know it was at the weekend around teatime. So it might well have been competing with *Songs of Praise* or *Antiques Roadshow* - there was nothing else on, basically.

It was very different from today, back then - no internet, and only 3 TV channels and the radio. There really wasn't much competition in broadcast entertainment, and I think a lot of shows were popular because they were the only ones available.

There's a narrative on here that ""everyone at the BBC knew"" and that the BBC is disgusting for ""covering up"" for Savile, but that misunderstands how he operated. Those who ""knew"" about Savile recognised that he was creepy as fuck, but Savile was smart enough to steer clear of those who showed an aversion to him - few people saw anything of substance.

Instead, Savile would cultivate those clueless enough to think him harmless and friendly - when he was confronted by a senior BBC manager about some rumours he just brushed them off, and the manager was daft enough just to accept that. That was Savile's stock-in-trade - to cosy up with clueless managers and tell them, ""oh, it's just silly talk - it goes with being a celebrity; people are always saying things about me, I think nothing of it"".

I'm pretty sure that, as he did this to allay suspicion of his activities, he also manipulated his own career - talking up managers who liked his shows.

It's like that bloke at work who's work is shit, and it's no secret, but he gets promoted because he brown-noses the boss.

Savile was an artist in this regard, elevated to a status of ""national treasure"" not by the public, but by incompetent television executives who admired his charity work (for hospitals whose bosses themselves were bumbling enough to leave him alone with the patients).

For The Doctor, we all know his race has both male and female; of which they can regenerate into the other sex and back. It does not mean they have to nor they will.

1) **Soundtracks**:  Although a lot of the footage is missing for for First and Second Doctor's serials, all the audio still exists.  They've used this audio to create soundtracks with linking narration  (usually by the original actors) to describe scenes without dialogue or scenes with a lot of physical actions.  I haven't actually heard any of these, but it's the most basic of the three.

2) **Reconstructions using still images**:  They use the audio tracks mentioned above, and place them on old stills/photographs of the sets in the stories.  There's usually a black bar that moves across the bottom of the screen describing physical actions, similar to the narration mentioned above.  I like this type of reconstruction the most because I like seeing the actors and it gives me an idea of how the story looked when it was aired.

&gt;*I don't understand who is being bribed, and bribed to do what. The money is going to charities like Oxfam, ActionAid etc, according to the video. **Isn't giving money to charity politically neutral already?***

Nope. It isn't when they are clearly promoting an institution which they are not are represented for. It's like:

*Hey we are a charity to end poverty say thanks to the EU!*

They are promoting all the so called ""benefits"" from the EU when it is, in reality, our money going full circle. Some of your tax is going to the government and from the government the EU. Then the EU takes a whopping slice of it before giving a large, but percentage of those funds, back into charities. These charities misrepresent that and label it as the EU being nice which is, of course, a huge boost for publicity.

It's mislabeled propaganda.

The irony is that charities, like Oxfam, are promoting an institution (the EU) which has very unfriendly economic policies against third world countries. The EU cripples both all developing nations with excessive and bureaucratic regulations and tariffs which prevent such countries from exporting their goods. The EU, for example, uses our money to subsidise certain EU agriculture (farms/fisheries). This drastically relieves the price for production making it an unfair competition. African agriculture, especially, has been crippled by such subsidies holding back their economy and yet more poverty stricken. This can't be stressed with how reliant Africa is on the food trade. These charities claim to support the poor...",null,0,null,1438492721,null,null,false,0,ctom8ff,null,t3_3fb9ku,null,null,null,t1_ctoepdx,null,null,null,1440231498,null,0,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

This wasn't a simple ""key down the side of a car"" job, his bonnet, spoiler, both rear wings and if I remember correctly a door as well, were all damaged in a couple of ways. The worst hit panel, the bonnet, had a large penis scratched in to it with ""I &lt;3 cock"" next to it, right down to the primer (irreparable without repainting), the other panels looked to have been rubbed with a rock or a brick, sustaining considerable paint damage but fortunately not all the way down to the primer so most of it came out with a lot of time spent wet sanding and refinishing. To return the car to the standard it was in before would require at least a 50% coverage respray.  
  
I hope they catch whoever did this, as I know if it happened to my car I would be devastated.

We have solidified with a few defensive signings but I doubt we have really improved the team THAT much compared to teams around us. We are very reliant on other teams messing up this season.

We need a new DM to partner Bentaleb to really shore us up as a defensive unit, and maybe a new addition out on the left wing to compete with the hot-and-cold Chadli.

**6th** seems fair. We need higher-spending teams to mess up to get any higher and we would really need to mess up to end up lower.


*Which player is going to be your star of the season and why?*

Bentaleb.

Kane took everyone by surprise last season but Bentaleb was also incredible. He is one of the best young talents in the Premier League right now and at age 20 he posses the ability and drive to change games. Before the end of the season I guarantee everyone will realise what a talent he is.

null,null,nifara,null,null,null,"What I find weird about this article, and your response to this article, is the repeated assertion that the Corbyn faction is pursuing ideological purity and will somehow wipe anything but their perfect vision from the party. What I find truly weird about that is how *it has been made explicitly clear this is not the case*. Corbyn, in fact, is strongly pushing to return a number of functions back to democratic mechanisms. That means he doesn't want to pick his shadow cabinet, but have them voted for (for example). He's made it abundantly clear he's happy to work with those across he broad church, that he values and prizes the broad church, and that he wants dissent, discussion and compromise.

Your definition of populism is an incredibly niche one, and not the one that, I suspect, anyone else is using.

I also think it's a flaw to think that because the population is centrist that means that many of Corbyn's views aren't appealing. The centre ground may have moved right in the last couple of decades, but that's no guarantee it will stay there. Nothing he's proposed (other than perhaps the right to buy stuff) is really radical. It's stuff Kinnock and Blair stood on for the most part.

The continuing storyline should be about a mysterious woman who seems to know the doctor really well; but we (the audience) have no idea who she is (we can theorise). Let this build momentum for the whole season (let's call it 8 for arguments sake).

Then make the finale a two-part story; make it mostly based around the mystery of her character...then, just as the cliffhanger to that episode give the reveal that she is actually the regenerated form of a Timelord who was famously known to fans as a male; thereby introducing the concept of gender regeneration. Let's say The Master for example. 

The person playing this role should be someone who would have actually made an excellent first female doctor herself, so that the fans are left feeling that there is an acceptable precedence for gender regeneration, but frustrated that someone awesome has slipped through their fingers.

Work are offering to give you an 8% payrise.  The only catch is that you can't spend it now.  Because you are giving up salary, you will pay less tax.  The idea is that the two cancel each other out and your take-home pay isn't too adversely effected.

You will need to check your contract to see what work benefits *might* be effected.  Usually it's bonus, life assurance, redundancy payout, etc.  If you're not receiving state benefits (and it's likely you're not) you don't need to worry about those.

Balance.  It's a 4 way game.  Paying off past debt, living for today, saving for immediate needs, saving for the (far) future.  Anything you put in a pension today is a direct gift to you in 40 years time.  Only you can make the choice about that.

This has a knock on effect in two ways:

1) You can't really debate the issue with a lot of people who are anti-immigration as when you actually show them facts that show they are wrong they won't listen because ""everyone knows"" this is what's happening.

2) When you try to take a reasonable anti-immigration stance anyone who is pro-immigration has only really ever seen nonsensical or racist arguments and therefore has concluded the only real reason to be against immigration is if you're racist as there's no logical reason.

Its often said that the best way to undermine an position is to argue for it badly. This is the same thing, the more even I see dumb shit like that being spouted the less inclined I am to listen to ANY anti-immigration arguments because inevitably they turn out to be dumb in most the cases.

Will compassion magically solve the issue of finite resources? I don't think so. It's a cold truth - but more realistic than the ludicrous notion we can somehow afford to help anyone and everyone who comes knocking. Sorry if that upsets you. 

&gt; I never said immigrants are ""claiming restitution"" when they come over here (another big strawman of yours), I'm just highlighting how shitty your selfish rationalisations are.

No, you didn't. Neither did they. That's the point - Britain's history doesn't seem to be the issue here - I wonder why you brought it up? 

&gt; I expect nothing better from you, but I am rather surprised to read your sudden and convenient shame at our empire and the wickedness of our colonial past.

Eh? 

&gt; The rest of us have learned from the past, and that is exactly why we have the 1951 Refugee Convention - because the nazis put gay, jewish and disabled people into camps and gassed them. To death, in case you were unaware or had forgotten.

And again: eh? You write like a Daily Mail journalist - full of sensationalism. It didn't take long to reach talk of Nazis gassing Jews... as though that's somehow relevant to the issue of allocating finite resources to local citizens and international immigrants. 

In other words - you're sidelining us from the point of the issue and it's fortune you're not in any great position of power in this because you'd be a huge waste of time. 

&gt; but you deserve to be mocked when you reply to a call for compassion with, in effect, ""tough luck on them for being born poor"".

More sensationalism. ""in effect"" in this case meaning ""I'm going to put words in your mouth"". Feel free to directly quote me - but equally feel free to fuck off with your insinuation and false claims. I never, ever, said it was tough luck on anyone for being poor. I *did* say that rather than doing what you're doing - we ought to be focusing on how we can afford to allocate finite resources and whether it's possible to do so in favor of anyone who comes seeking them. 

Can we focus on the matter at hand? Or do you truly believe that compassion is worth more than actually looking at solving the problem? I've a feeling the latter is worth far more long term value - fixing the problem is a hell of a lot better than sitting around whining about how much you care that there's a problem.

null,null,MasterBulldog,null,null,null,"I wasn't encouraging anyone to do anything, I was simply stating what I do. And as someone who has breezed through advanced driving tuition and used a number of vehicle types, I'm well aware that speed limits are not there to annoy me! 

The thing is, people see speed limits as a hard rule, and technically this is right. However, I see them as a guide. In other words I read the road conditions, I'm aware of who and what is around me and I assess possible situations that may develop. This is why I made the point that if you fail to see a speed camera, you are driving too fast for your skill level. I never drive faster than I am comfortably able to think and take in all the information around me.

So on this basis, I am just as likely to drive BELOW the speed limit as drive above it. A good example of this is the road right outside the house I live in. It has a national speed limit (60mph) but knowing the road as I do, it's often a poor risk to actually do this, especially in wintry conditions. Yet almost everyone clocks the national speed limit sign and do not read the road, the result is many accidents. We had a car land in the front garden last November! The car wasn't ""speeding"" according to the limit set by the sign, but they were speeding when the conditions are considered.

So my point is that speeding does not pose that much of a threat IF the conditions etc have been judged correctly. Speeding itself doesn't kill anyone, inappropriate speeding does.

And contrary to what they'll tell you on the ghost tours, the tenements really weren't built that high. More like six or seven floors, nine at the very most. If you look at [this picture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Samuel_Dukinfield_Swarbreck_\(attr\)_View_of_Edinburgh_1827_5.jpg) you'll get an idea - it's from 1827 so a little later than you're looking at, but the important thing is that it pre-dates the City Improvement Act of 1867. [This picture's](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/The_Old_Tolbooth.jpg) a copy of one of Naysmyth's engravings, and you can see some particularly tall ones, probably nine storeys, across the road from the Tolbooth. There's a book called Lost Edinburgh by Hamish Coghill. You need a copy. 

2. The intellectual clubs start with the founding of the Easy Club by Ruddiman some time in the 1710s, iirc, and they're pretty widespread in the city by the 1750s. Latter half of the 18th century is when most of the well-known Enlightenment figures were active and publishing. Read Boswell's Edinburgh journals. 

3. There was a wider engagement than just the well-known figures, thanks to the club system - you're still looking at men of a certain social status and level of education, though. People like Burns and Hume were well-known in town (remember it's a really small place - the population's about 33,000 in the 1780s, I think) and had their favourite drinking dens and oyster cellars. Their social circles weren't restricted to fellow intellectuals. 

4. This is not so much my area, but I'll give it a go... The Jacobites were still in the public consciousness. There were people in Edinburgh who still remembered the city being captured in 1745, and Gaelic speakers are still regarded with a bit of suspicion (for instance, men shouldn't let their wives be carried in a sedan chair by Highlanders because while they're strong they're very volatile and likely to bounce her around or go at an unbecoming speed). However, the act banning Highland dress gets repealed in 1782, and there are prominent families (town council level) who were Jacobite supporters and don't seem to have suffered for it, so attitudes can't have been that uptight. Well on the way to romanticising the whole thing a few decades later... 

5. That's a massive question, and the reply would be too big for one comment. Honestly, your best bet is to read some primary source material and take note of the things you see coming up. I've recommended Boswell because journals are always handy for these things. If you're still in Scotland and have access to one of the major libraries, see if you can get the microfilm of the Edinburgh Courant to give you an idea of the concerns and manners of the day.

Aside from a short paragraph thanking me for sending the information and photos, the email was mostly copied and pasted information about acne and the 3 treatments they offer. No real comment was made on my skin which was disappointing.

The treatments were made available through the treatment page (although the order box said ""Upload a photo and our doctors will get back to you"" which was pretty confusing). You can request whether or not to let your doctor know about this treatment you're getting which is nice if you're having problems with them and would rather they not know. Then you choose from the recommended treatments (I was given a choice of Epiduo Gel and Oxytetracycline tablets) and order.

I didn't order any of the treatments. I have had severe acne before and have already been on a course of Accutane (which I included in my form) and was hoping for more comment on whether it's worth going for a top up course. However it seems that they saw that I had previously used Epiduo and Oxytetracycline and just churned out the relevant information for those products again.

These are the images I sent for reference:

I will still be going back to my GP for a referral back to a dermatologist. For the cost I was hoping for a bit more of a personalised service.

**This was what they sent me:**

&gt;Thank you for completing the online acne assessment and for sending us your photos for examination. Based on your answers to our questionnaire and assessing your photos I believe your acne would benefit from specific treatment and I have made this available to you in your patient record.

&gt;Please also read the following information about acne:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Acne
&gt;
&gt;Acne affects 9 of 10 teenagers at some time and in 3 of 10 cases treatment with medication is required to avoid permanent scaring. In the majority of cases acne settles after a few years but some people find that new spots keep appearing even after many years. Glands just under the surface of the skin produce a talky substance which is needed to moisturise the skin. In puberty these glands become more active owing to hormonal changes. Pimples appear when the exit of such a skin gland gets blocked (for example with dead skin cells obstructing the outlet), but the gland continues to produce its secretions. Bacteria which are usually part of healthy skin can then move into these blocked glands and cause inflammation just beneath the skin, leading to red, tender spots and pustules.
&gt;
&gt;How can acne be treated?
&gt;
&gt;Treatment of acne can take a long time to make a visible impact. Whichever treatment is chosen it is important to remember that skin changes slowly, patience and persistence are needed to achieve results. In many cases acne flares up again when the treatment is discontinued. It therefore often makes sense to continue treatment for several years, pausing every few months to reassess.Various different lotions, creams, solutions and tablets can be used to treat acne and different remedies may have a different effect from person to person. I think the following treatments may be very useful in your specific case:
&gt;
&gt;Epiduo Gel
&gt;
&gt;Epiduo gel works particularly well in mild to moderately severe acne. Epiduo contains two different active ingredients: Adapalene and Benzoyl peroxide.
&gt;
&gt;How to use Epiduo gel
&gt;
&gt;Apply a thin film of gel evenly over acne affected areas once a day at bedtime, avoiding the eyes, lips and nostrils. The skin should be clean and dry before application. You should wash your hands thoroughly after you have used Epiduo.
&gt;
&gt;Possible side effects of Epiduo:
&gt;
&gt;Common side effects (occur in less than 1 in 10 patients)
&gt;
&gt;dry skin
&gt;local skin rash (irritative contact dermatitis)
&gt;burning sensation
&gt;irritation of the skin
&gt;redness
&gt;scaling
&gt;Antibiotic tablets (Lymecycline)
&gt;
&gt;Lymecycline is an antibiotic that in our experience helps most people to achieve an improvement of their acne. It is easy to take and rarely has any side effects. It works particularly well in mild to moderately severe acne.Lymecycline treats acne by killing those bacteria that contribute to the causes of acne. It does not however unplug blocked pores. If apart from inflamed, red spots you also suffer from lots of blackheads or whiteheads it would be advisable to also use a gel or cream such as Benzoyl Peroxide to help opening blocked pores.
&gt;
&gt;How to take Lymecycline
&gt;
&gt;You need to take one capsule once a day, ideally at roughly the same time each day.
&gt;
&gt;Possible side effects of Lymecycline
&gt;
&gt;Lymecycline can cause nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Rare possible side effects include allergic skin reaction, inflammation of liver or pancreas and headaches.
&gt;
&gt;Oxytetracycline
&gt;
&gt;Oxytetracycline is a slightly cheaper alternative to Lymecycline. It works in the same fashion but needs to be taken twice daily.
&gt;
&gt;How to take Oxytetracycline
&gt;
&gt;You need to take two capsules twice a day, ideally at roughly the same time each day.
&gt;
&gt;Possible side effects of Oxytetracycline
&gt;
&gt;Oxytetracycline can also cause nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Rare possible side effects include allergic skin reaction, inflammation of liver or pancreas and headaches.
&gt;
&gt;Antibiotics and the pill
&gt;
&gt;Please note that both Lymecycline and Oxytetracycline may affect the contraceptive pill. If you are using a pill we therefore recommend that you use condoms in addition for the first three weeks of your treatment. (If you continue to take both your pill and Lymecycline regularly, your pill will again provide you with reliable contraception after a period of three weeks).  It's important that you do not get pregnant whilst taking these antibiotics, as they could harm your unborn baby. 
&gt;
&gt;Always read the label and the leaflet that comes with your medication.
&gt;
&gt;Please do let me know if you have any questions or if you experience any unexpected side effects. You can contact us any time via your confidential patient record.

null,null,londener,null,null,null,"Are you talking about on roads or sidewalks here? There is no law requiring cyclists to do this. Cyclists are not allowed to cycle on sidewalks, but there are no speed limits that apply to cyclists at this time. I would argue that a cyclist on a roadway should follow the posted speed limit of an area for safety and that maybe there should be a consideration for bike speed limits in certain areas, but currently there is no law like this that cyclists need to follow. So if a pedestrian is hit on a road when they don't have right of way they cyclist might not be found to be at fault, just like a vehicle wouldn't necessarily be at fault in the same situation. 

I would recommend you contact your local MP to suggest this if you feel strongly about it. 

As a cyclist I do my best to avoid hitting anything and follow the same rules a vehicle would. I also cycle in very busy parts of London where pedestrians walk on the street and decide randomly when to cross without looking and I am by no means barreling down the road way. I am a very slow cyclist.  I have however hit a pedestrian one time, where it was completely unavoidable and although I wasn't going very fast I was unable to stop completely. The guy had been walking along the roadway in the direction of traffic eating a sandwich and decided to cross my path as I was cycling. I had been ringing my bell as a warning to pedestrians that I was around (as you wouldn't believe how many people do not look both ways before crossing a street and obviously cyclists don't make a lot of noise without a bell). I still ran into him, mostly just bumped him as I managed to slow down, but couldn't avoid him due to other pedestrians also in the street. He immediately apologized and said he should know better as he was a cyclist too, but it was a horrible experience for me. In this situation, because of the pedestrians actions I had no way to avoid him. Just like sometimes you walk down the street and can bump into someone who suddenly decides to change their direction. The only difference here is the speed and the inflicted damage. 


Anyone that uses a roadway has to take responsibility for their own safety, no matter how they are going from point A and B. You learn this on a bicycle quickly. You can not assume anyone will try to stop for you or avoid you or not do dangerous things around you. Pedestrians should not assume vehicles or cyclists will stop for them if they are not in a crossing/junction or have right of way.  Sometimes there is nothing you can do as a cyclist to avoid certain things because you can not control the actions of others or mind read what they are about to do next. Just like you can be an amazing driver and still have a collision because of someone else's actions. Everyone needs to practice common sense to ensure their safety and try to maintain the safety of those around them if possible.

This ridiculous myth that the Iraq War was some kind of villainous plot to steal oil/kill babies is honestly astounding. Yes, the military overestimated Saddam's capabilities, but it was a well-known fact Saddam had [previously used WMDs against Iranians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction#Chemical_weapon_attacks) and [his own civilian population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halabja_chemical_attack), and that Saddam [had attempted to develop nuclear weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction#Program_development_1960s_-_1980s). Combine this with Saddam's [massive military buildup at the time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_Army#During_the_1990s), and the fact that [less than 15 years ago he'd failed to invade and annex an independent nation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War), I'd say we had a pretty fucking good reason to invade Iraq. Lastly, Saddam wasn't exactly this fantastic, stabilising guy, considering his penchant to engage in ethnic slaughters and mass-repression. While it is true the UN was violated in the invasion, I think this was perfectly justified considering that not only do China and Russia, two repressive dictatorships with their own interests in Saddam's dictatorship, possess veto power in the Security Council, but that the human cost of letting a tyrant like Saddam remain in power would've been pretty high.

Oh, and [Iraq's oil extraction all has to be done as joint-ventures, with the majority of profits going to the government of Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_reserves_in_Iraq#2009), so that conspiracy is pretty weak, even more so when you consider the fact that most of the oil companies engaged in extraction aren't even Western.

Again I will say it, I was condoning travelling at speeds in which the driver is able to take in and successfully process all the information. If they failed to see a speed camera, they are driving too fast for their abilities. So actually, I was condoning slowing down in order to achieve this.

Speeding in itself does not cause anything other than going fast. What causes accidents in the UK is lack of concentration, so using mobile phones whilst driving, other in-vehicle distractions, driving under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs, not enough space between vehicles etc. Speed isn't implied in any of this. Most accidents happen during over taking (caused by cars going too slow btw), at T-junctions and within a mile of the home. Speeding is not a factor in most causes. The safest roads are the motorways and dual-carriageways, where people speed.

But if he becomes party leader, he won't become prime minister in 2020. Corbyn under Labour means they'll be 10 years of a Conservative government because the general public that exist outside of the Reddit bubble won't vote for him. 

You can say he may change people's minds- but the Murdoch press, who to a great extent control public political discourse, would never allow that to happen. He'll be painted as a dangerous old socialist and political radical and that will be more than enough to discourage the kind of voters who determine who wins an election- The comfortable middle classes and the affluent pensioners- from voting Labour.

Corbyn only really appeals to the trade unionists, leftwing students and the Guardian reader demographic- You can't win an election with just those kind of supporters- you need a wide appeal and Corbyn's not going to get that.

Blair understood that to win an election Labour needs to claim the centre ground, and Corbyn's not the man who is going to do that. I really do sympathise with the Corbyn supporters because ideally you should be voting for a leader who you believe in, whose policies you agree with and choosing someone with good character and political conviction. However, I honestly don't believe he'll ever become prime minister because in British politics he's a radical, and radicals don't win elections. Corbyn is the martyr's choice- Voting for him as party leader may be the right thing to do and what your conscience tells you to do but it won't make Labour the ruling party of this country. It's tantamount of political suicide. Unless the Tories do a major fuck up, we'll have another 5 years of their rule after 2020 because Corbyn is Labour's party leader.

null,null,TrickyDickNixonbot,,People who disagree with me are war criminals,null,"&gt; But the whole reason we went to war was because Blair and Bush told us they had solid evidence that Saddam has nukes,

Erm, no, they claimed we had solid evidence he possessed chemical weapons, and was most likely developing nuclear and biological again. 

&gt; and our only option to save the world from nuclear war would be to invade the entire middle east.

Erm.... I dont recall anyone ever saying we had to invade the entire Middle East? Or that the only way to stop a nuclear war was by doing that? I think your history of the Iraq War may be a little bit sketchy mate.

&gt; We didn't put our entire credibility as a nation on the line spending trillions to stop Saddam killing his own people, thats not our job.

Actually yeah, trying to keep stability and world peace where no other nation will actually kind of is our moral obligation, IMO. Im not particularly dandy with letting thousands of people be slaughtered when there was a clear alternative and way to stop it.

&gt; If that was our job we should be invading Burma

That was actually discussed, the thing is it wasnt militarily feasible, nor was there a correct situation for regime change. This existed in Iraq, however. You are aware these processes are a lot more complex than 'JUST INVADE IT', right? 

&gt; The entire mess in the middle east, the reason so many people in that entire reigon hate us, is because of the lie Blair fed us.

I think you'll find the Baathists and the Nasserists were whipping up anti-Westernism a long time before all that mate, once again, I think your history of this is questionable to say the least. Also lets ignore [that a poll during the occupation showed most Iraqis wanted Western troops to stay.](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/19_03_07_iraqpollnew.pdf). 

&gt; That is enough cause for a full investigation. Our PM lied to us for fuck sake, you think its ok to reject the notion that we should merely investigate it?

He didn't lie, he went off the evidence that was presented to him which did solidly suggest Saddam possessed WMDs. Sometimes these things are wrong, but he didn't lie. Plus, the humanitarian benefits of waging the Iraq War and stabilising the region (which did not happen because of the pacifist movement clamouring for withdrawal prior to the job being finished, leading to ISIS, great job) were very clearly the other big objectives.",null,1,null,1438509513,null,null,false,0,ctoqxp8,null,t3_3fhifc,null,null,null,t1_ctoqsn6,null,null,null,1440233714,null,0,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,0,null

null,null,Globagoz,flair5,,null,"**How do you think this season will go?**

For us to really push for top 4, we'll need a few of our players to step up. Lamela will have to build on the consistent performances he showed at the end of last season, while Eriksen will have to do the opposite - avoid a repeat of last season's drop in form (Pritchard as a rotation option should help offset his fatigue). I also feel that Chadli's impressive goalscoring form belies the rest of his game, which still needs a lot of work. It also depends which players we buy in August. With our current squad, I predict **6th**.

**Which player is going to be your star of the season and why?**

It's hard to see past Bentaleb. He improved so much last season, and was easily our most consistent midfielder. And he's still only 20! If he can keep going from strength to strength, I can see him becoming our most crucial player. Additionally, if we can bring in a new, more defensively-minded CM to partner him, he'll be able to play a bit less conservatively and contribute more to attack.

**How do you think the team will line up?**

At the moment, we'll likely be sticking with last season's starting XI, except with Alderweireld instead of Dier. However, there are still a few questions - does Poch rate Mason enough to keep him as Bentaleb's partner? If we bring in a striker who can play out wide, will Chadli or Lamela make way? And where does Dembele fit in to the team? He was quite effective playing behind Kane for a few months, but Poch seems to have gone off that idea.

This is incorrect, finite resources will not be a thing of the past until humanity becomes incorporated into a giant supercomputer and lives out an existence as a digital entity requiring no future maintenance, sustenance, etc. As for the labour market, while there is a substantially better argument for automation ending work, there is a lot of evidence that automation inevitably just opens up new jobs elsewhere.

Im actually really tired of the Neoliberal boogeyman. The 'Neoliberal' paradigm actually made some much-needed changes to economic thought, but yes, it has outlived its usefulness. Like all economic schools of thought however, its a lot more flexible than that and the word has essentially lost all meaning.

The only question is which is the worse pairing: Skrtel and Lovren or Sakho and Lovren? If he's with Skrtel, he pushes up and strands Martin away behind him, opening up space for attacking players to run into. If he's with Sakho they're both leaping for every ball, not communicating and just generally causing heart attacks.

Corbyn scares them because they think he'll make them poor. He wants to attack businesses - but what happens when a business is attacked?

The baillifs will come for all the office desks, machines, patents, property till there is nothing left. And people will become unemployed.

So any party that said ""I'm going to attack, attack. *attack* business because I have to hate them to be true to Marx"" is going to have voters desert in droves. Because no one wants to sacrifice their jobs on the altar of Corbynism.

If Corbyn wins, the only question is how many seats we will lose. I reckon all of our London heartland will go. Londoners are capitalists - they vote New Labour mainly because they want good services as well. Any Labour party that attacked capitalism itself would get short shrift from them.

At the very least what we need is to not grant genome patents and open up the market, otherwise it will just be the  pharmaceutical industry all over again.

I think you've missed my point on the biological aspects, [this](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesmcwilliams/2013/12/13/health-concerns-over-gmos-distract-consumers-from-the-real-problem-of-monoculture/), is a good summary of the wealth of biological and ecological problems which come with GMOs. These problems can be overcome and I'm sure will be overcome, but that doesn't mean they should be ignored, which they currently are.

I don't think we shouldn't embrace GMO crops, we just shouldn't rush into it. Fundamentally you've got to remember the corporations are legally bound to make money for their share holders, if giving free seeds to Africa wasn't going to turn then profits later on then it would be illegal for them to do it. We need to put regulations in place to make sure that when they do decide to start making that money they don't end up holding Africa to ransom. I don't think moves to outright ban GMO crops are a good idea, but turning down offers of investment from corporations like Monsanto isn't a bad thing, if it was their first offer, it was probably a shit offer, that's negotiation 101",null,0,null,1438513031,null,null,false,0,ctorn2b,null,t3_3fer6b,null,null,null,t1_ctorcna,null,null,null,1440234046,null,2,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Matched betting is essentially a 'risk free' way of making money from bookmakers, using a betting exchange to 'match' anything you bet on by betting against the original outcome. It's a little tricky to get your head around at first, and most people don't trust the 'risk free' element. But if you're careful and understand what you're doing, it's fine. One important point to remember is that it is essentially *not* gambling.

It is easy to make £1,000+ in a month (for the first month) or so if you spend some time on it. If you have £50 to spare, then you can start small and get bigger. The most money to be made initially is from sign up bonuses at bookies e.g. ""Bet £10 and we'll give you £20 to bet with."" Lots of free material out there to get you started, and a big forum on MoneySavingExpert explaining it all.

Not true, sorry. I love me some drugs on occasion, but no recreational drug is without any harm. N2O is relatively very safe if used occasionally and sensibly.

More advanced symptoms include widespread numbness, difficulty walking, reduced sphincter control, shaking, unexplained pains, and others.

Maybe even try and suggest what other radically different definitions there are. Or at the very least try and take the point for what it is rather than pithily duck it?

I don't think the distinction between ideological purity and ""more democracy"" you are trying to make makes a lot of sense either. Much that he may say he wants something, it's important to bear in mind that he's a politician and everything he says he is saying because it will help him. So like, more democracy etc etc is equally just a populist tactic (he's telling people what they want to hear). I don't think this has actually brought more debate, but simply more fanaticism. No one's really asking whether it's *actually* a good idea, it's just assumed to be self-evident because that's what the people want etc. 

I never made the claim about centrism and Corbyn's policy in the way you cast it, nor that he is so unbelievably radical etc. 

Blair's manifesto kind of proves my point about politicians, populism and what you misunderstood about what centrism is for. You think he won just because of that policy? Did it ever even happen? It's a very superficial comparison there.

More recent research indicates that their popularity in Haddington was overstated, at least compared to the following they enjoyed in Prestonpans - though even that tailed off after their early work. If they hadn't gone down the electro-funk/synth-baroque path and tried to make it in London, they could have been really big in Scotland. Sad really. But the t-shirts were collectors' items for decades afterwards.

Getting a local mechanic to give the car a once-over before you pay is a very good idea - you'll probably want to do this at some point anyway, but it'll allow you to factor in the cost of replacing stuff that wears out, or to identify a patched-up wreck (which can be incredibly unsafe). At least a few out of brake pads and discs, tyres, clutch, filters, belts, battery, various fluids, exhaust, spark plugs and various other bits and pieces can all be expected to need replacing at some point once you're looking at 80,000+ mile cars.

He wants to leave NATO and remove our nuclear deterrent. Both of those were bequeathed to us by Attlee.

It's kept the peace in Europe for 70 years, it's one of Labour's greatest achievements. And Corbyn *hates* it.

He hates everything the Blair govt achieved (and they achieved a lot - built and staffed 149 new hospitals, without which we'd have a health crisis right now, minimum wage, worker protections for part time and temporary workers, maternity leave extended from 14 weeks to 39 weeks, introduced paternity leave). All these things are *evil* and *Tory* because it was done by New Labour in government.

He opposed the Falklands war, even though the Argentines were led by a fascist junta that killed and tortured 30,000 people (many of whom were left-wing), and thought we should hand the Falklanders to them against their will.

I could go on and on and on.

Now for the bad news: the court doesn't like having its time wasted. If either or both sides request your SO attend court, then she will be asked to come along. If the court believes she has something to say which is relevant to the case then it can compel her to attend, and she may get herself into trouble if she ignores a witness summons.

Also - NATO was a **Labour govt achievement**.

A bit of history: Ernest Bevin (the former leader of the Transport and General Workers Union) was the foreign secretary in Attlee's government and came up with the idea of collective defence based on how trade unions work (if you attack one you attack us all). But had difficulty persuading the Americans because they thought the solidarity clause affected their sovereignty. 

So he went ahead and signed a solidarity pact with France and the Benelux countries in 1948 (the treaty of Brussels). However Germany was outside this pact and the Russians began blockading Berlin. That together with the invasion of Czechcoslovakia persuaded the Americans to change their minds. A new treaty was signed in 1949 setting up NATO, which included Britain, France and teh Benelux countries, and added in the USA, Canada and Germany.

It's kept the peace for 70 years, it's had a global impact and it was a *Labour* achievement. And Corbyn hates it.

The nuclear deterrent was also given to us by Labour. Bevin came back from a UN meeting saying ""we need one of these things with a bloody big Union Jack on it"" and Attlee agreed.

So to conclude - Corbyn not only hates Blair, he hates Attlee's achievements too.",null,0,null,1438514078,null,null,1438514588,0,ctoruwu,null,t3_3fhuqw,null,null,null,t3_3fhuqw,null,null,null,1440234149,null,6,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,6,null

You'll get no argument here.  Nuclear weapons might not be a nice way to keep the peace, but ultimately they works, and they work far better than having large standing armies, one of the factors that led to World War 1.  

My other main issue is even though, over all, we live in a relatively more peaceful world now, most wars being of a civil nature, that's not a guarantee for the future.  If Britain was ever targeted and we had no second retaliation nuclear weapons (Trident), and we weren't part of NATO, then you could end up with the dying survivors simply waiting for an invading force to take over, one that just used weapons of mass destruction on them, and the military wouldn't even be able to defend them.  This is a far fetched scenario I admit, and I prefer to keep it that way.

Certainly I think everyone would be happy if we had a unilateral worldwide agreement to retire, disarm and promise never to make nuclear weapons again.  In the mean time I think Britain should adopt a no-first-use policy which is written into law and push for NATO to do the same, this is the policy both China and India have.",null,0,null,1438514081,null,null,false,0,ctoruxs,null,t3_3fhuqw,null,null,null,t1_ctorm5f,null,null,null,1440234149,null,6,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,6,null

The problem I have with this argument -- and I see it a lot on here -- is that, in that season at Southampton, he was *individually* praised almost every week. There were entire MNF segments dedicated to how great his positioning was, how well he communicated with the other defenders, etc. Carragher and Neville heaped praise on him, and they aren't pundits that don't know what they're talking about -- they're pretty good at their job. They mention Fonte, of course, but the bulk of the praise went to Lovren. 

That isn't something that happens from simply having a good centre half next to you and a good DM in front. It was more individual than that, more instinctive.

Also, the main difference is that republicanism isn't built on loyalty to Gerry Adams. There are plenty of republicans that hate him and SF as much as loyalists do. Republicanism is based on rationalism, the idea that we would all be served best by organising a state with equality at its core. 

Loyalism isn't much better than religious fundamentalism, just replace the word 'faith' with 'loyalty' and change the object of devotion from 'God' to 'all things British' and you're done, that's all there is to it.

null,null,FezojT,null,null,null,"As a recent physics graduate, taking a physics/astro course isn't an easy alternative. Id give computer science a shot before looking to transfer because what you think physics is and what it actually is are two separate things. It is *so* much more maths heavy than A level to the point where A level physics is quite poor preperation for the degree. The maths you do starts where you left off at a level and continues onwards (some overlap, since the kids who didn't do further maths will have to learn complex numbers, series expansions etc. for the first time). You should really get an appreciation of what the course involves before committing. It's also highly likely the physics degree will have a compulsory programming element (though obviously with less emphasis than comp Sci). 

If you go into it expecting it to be at all similar to A level physics you're going to be disappointed and may be looking to transfer again to engineering before the year is up. 

I wouldn't worry about your programming ability just yet. It's quite rare for A level students to have any formal programming education at all (unless things hehe changed a lot in 4 years), so part of the course will involve developing programming skills I'm sure. You'll find its just like any language and that you'll become more fluent if you have more practice. Computer science focuses more on the methods and maths behind computation anyway, programming languages are just tools for passing instructions to the computer. You'll likely end up finding the conceptual stuff harder and the actual programming fine.

We created instability and thus created the battle ground from which ISIL could rise.

Yes the situation under Saddam was bad, but the situation since is definitely worse as a humanitarian crisis. And it is entirely our fault.

He only had two years of schooling in his village, but despite this and his accent, the public school chaps of Foreign Office adored him. Compared to his wishy-washy predecessor Anthony Eden, there was massive relief at how straightforward and sound Bevin was.

Bevin also negotiated the Marshall Plan - and he got his way on that as well as NATO because the Americans *liked* him. The Americans of the 1940's (think ""Give 'em hell"" Harry Truman) despised the toffs of the previous Tory govt associating them with George III, colonialism and the enemy in the war of independence. But it was very hard to hold similar prejudices about Bevin because he was so different.

The Smiler has a throughput of something like 1,200 people per hour.  Even allowing for delays and mechanical issues that's still going to even out at over 50,000 people a week.  While there was previously a lot of noise around mechanical failures the worst of these was a plastic guide wheel breaking.  This **is** a serious failure, but there was nothing that suggested it was a real threat to life and limb at this point.

Nemesis has had over 30 million riders (total rides, not distinct individuals) in the last twenty years and my understanding is that the only serious incident it had was due to someone climbing the fence.

Prior to the Smiler crash the only really serious incident I could find any evidence for was the Mine Cart derailing.  (I went last year with someone who was convinced it was all an ungodly death trap.  I spent a while looking things up to try to convince her it was safe.)

&gt;In 1991 in its last season of operation a car stalled on the second big drop. The ride shut down as designed, with other cars held at various blocks before and after the stalled car. The ride operator restarted the ride thinking that the stalled car (which had valleyed) would also start and continue its journey. A second car collided with it. The report in to the incident found that the member of staff had inadequate training. She also had access to keys that allowed her to override the block system, a procedure that should only be authorised by a more qualified person, such as maintenance. Alton Towers were fined.

null,null,devilliers178,lfc68,,null,"First of all, he wasnt a bad buy. At the time, after the season he had just had in a team that play a similar sort of way to Liverpool, he was exactly the player we needed. Of course it hasnt worked out, but it really is just lazy to say he was an exceptionally bad signing with the benefit of hindsight. 
Obviously he has made individual errors, perhaps the biggest being an overzealousness to defend and influence the game. But you pointed out other reasons why he actually isnt totally to blame for his last season.

&gt;He had one decent season at Southampton with Fonte next to him and Wanyama and Schneiderlin in front of him.

Yes, he had a solid line up infront of him every week. Whats more Southamption ALWAYS played with 2 central midfielders sitting infront of the back 4 as opposed to one rapidly ageing Steven Gerrard. At Liverpool he played with Sakho, Skrtel, Manquillo, Johnson, Moreno, Lucas, Henderson, Gerrard, Sterling, Ibe and Markovic all occupying those positions at some point in the season.

&gt;He doesn't communicate with the left back or with Skrtel, he aggressively and needlessly pushes too far forward leaving acres of space behind him and he struggles to recover.

BR earmarked him and lauded over his 'leadership qualities' and his character, and like i already said his errors did come from overzealousness. However, Moreno and Manquillo also stepped up like Lovren did which caused us issues. For me this indicates a coaching lapse where players do not know where they want to be rather than individual errors. A case could be made for Skrtel being the liability with such proactive defenders around him when his game is so much more reactionary. 


TLDR: Yeah he had a bad season, but there are reasons.

see those little tax disk thingys on all vehicles except bicycles? ( to be fair since January its computerised so you dont need to display the disk anymore)

cyclists are the only road users to not pay tax and also to not be licenced in any way. other road users must pass a test - the main emphasis of which is safety - and all vehicles must have a unique number plate for identification

when you actually think about it, allowing a group of unlicenced, untested, and untrained vehicle users to  share the road with everyone else is just crazy

there really is a strong argument that cyclists should be licenced and tested, carry some sort of number plate, and also be required to have at least 3rd party insurance - JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER USER OF THE ROAD

You really need to split your budget into essential outgoings (e.g. rent, utilities, bills), and your discretionary spending (pub, takeaway etc.).


The breakdown of the discretionary spending is not so important. In fact it makes it more difficult to track. You should have an idea of how much you want to be spending per week in total on 'lifestyle' stuff and track it that way. 


On the figures themselves:
- Gas and elec look very low. Budget more towards £20.
- Taxi (assuming this is after a night out) could be low. £5 doesn't take you far (unless you are sharing I suppose).
- Alcohol - £10. Pub £40. Nights out £20. I don't know your lifestyle but first impression is that these look off. How did you get these figures?

As a general tip, you also want to budget for ""incidentals"", just things that come along the way - getting a coffee, breaking a note so you can get change, picking up extra food items etc. In my experience this can range from £10 a week to £40 depending on the person.

null,null,potpan0,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country,null,"&gt; communism should be remembered about as fondly as Nazism for all the suffering it's caused.

The difference is that ideologically, cruelty in far-right politics is unavoidable. Social Darwinism is an intrinsic part of far-right ideologies like fascism, and the belief that the nation (which always becomes indistinguishable from ethnicity and race, despite what Italian fascists try to say) is most important, and that nations will inevitably need to fight to get what they want, is written directly in books like Mein Kampf. It seems events like the Holocaust are unavoidable with ideologies like fascism, as they emphasise so much between different peoples. 

In communist, or other far-left ideologies, these Social Darwinist tendencies simply don't exist. You won't, as far as I know, find them in any Marx, or Lenin, or Trotsky, or many other major radical left texts. Far left politics is about promoting equality, as an attempt to counter the inequity found within capitalism. Does this mean all self-proclaimed far left movements have supported equality? Of course not, but ideologically inequality isn't at the heart of communism, whereas it is at the heart of fascism, and that's why we consider them so differently.

Let their agents drop their name and see who bites. Perhaps we tried for Schneiderlin the first day the window opened but his agent advised him to wait and see if United would bid. If he signed for us right away he wouldn't be at United - great for us, maybe not so great for the player who wants to play at the richest club in the world in top competition with amazing players. There are a lot of things that go into a contract and I think it's probably best for the players themselves if they slow things down and wait towards the latter part of the window to allow things to develop.

When you say that 'far left politics is about promoting equality, as an attempt to counter the inequity found within capitalism,' [is this what you're referring to?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin#Establishing_the_Cheka):


&gt;The Bolsheviks instructed Felix Dzerzhinsky to commence a Red Terror, an organized program of arrests, imprisonments, and killings.[182] At Moscow, execution lists signed by Lenin authorised the shooting of 25 former ministers, civil servants, and 765 White Guards in September 1918.[183]

&gt;Earlier, in October, Lev Kamenev and cohort, had warned the Party that terrorist rule was inevitable[184] In late 1918, when he and Nikolai Bukharin tried curbing Chekist excesses, Lenin overruled them; in 1921, via the Politburo, he expanded the Cheka's discretionary death-penalty powers.[185][186]

&gt;The White Russian counter-revolution failed for want of popular support and bad coordination among its disparate units. Meanwhile, Lenin put the Terror under a centralized secret police (""Cheka"") in summer 1918.[187] By May 1919, there were some 16,000 ""enemies of the people"" imprisoned in the Cheka's katorga labour camps; by September 1921 the prisoner populace exceeded 70,000.[188][189][190][191][192][193]",null,0,null,1438521863,null,null,false,0,ctotx0f,null,t3_3fhqqo,null,null,null,t1_ctotski,null,null,null,1440235184,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

""A number of factors play a role in determining where an asylum seeker will lodge his / her application.

So, unless each individual and phoned in and the mistake eas replicated 300 times, the mistake was in all probability and incorrectly completed P11D. And Its the employers responsibility to get the P11D right - customer's can't simply phone in an say ""the P11d was wrong, change my code"". They have to get the employer to send in a correct P11D. If not, there's nothing stopping someone from manipulating P11D figures to evade paying tax on a company benefit.

So what happens is the company needs to correct the P11D and then send them back in. P11ds are regularly incorrect, espdcially when the last day of the tax year - 05/04/YY - is incorrectly entered as the benefit's end date. HMRC don't get P11Ds until the end of July at the latest either, and the P11Ds are to confirm the previous year figures. Until a P11D figure is recoeved to confirm the figures, employer benefits in a code are based upon the PY figures or at estimates provided by a customer that only impact the CY.

Anymore 'examples' you want me to destroy?


Edit: just to add, if someone wants their CY code changed regarding a compmay benefit we need to say something like ""the emp ben in your code is based upon the PY P11D figures. We can change this in he CY, but you need to be aware that with the final end of year calculation we will use the P11d the company sends in, and of the figures provided by yourself differ it could generate an overpayment or underpayment."" 

If a customer is phoning in about the Employer benefit in the previous years code, we have to inform them that the togure can only be changed on receipt of a P11D. If the customer thinks the benefit in the code was wrong, they need to take this up with the employer and request that they check and if necessary send in a correct P11D.

The Tories won because their policies appeal to a broad range of people and they consolidated all the swing voters, the moderate voters and the right wing vote (UKIP only took a fraction of Tory voters - also most extreme right wingers, no big loss to anyone)

I'm as left wing as they come, but Jeremy Corbyn is very ideological in his beliefs. I am still waiting for a candidate that's a technocrat who will create legislation on evidence based based policies - not for megalomania (Blair, Umuna), corporate kickbacks or intellectual fancies (Milliband and Corbyn)

Corbyn has quoted [Marx](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/07/26/jeremy-corbyn-andrew-marr-labour-leadership-win_n_7873368.html) and several of his ideas, whilst admirable, do not line up with economic or political realties.

It's better for Labour to move back to the centre (despite my personal convictions) during their campaigning in order to appeal to the widest range of voters possible. Then, they would at least not be as bad as the Tories. And they can implement even more left wing policies than they initially let on.

I'll be voting Plaid in the next General Election if Corbyn wins. Plaid is actually pretty pragmatic, they have pretty sound economic policies (especially with regards to investment and focus on high value industries) and their desire to implement social democratic policies in a sustainable manner.

No. The whole point of having different parties to vote for is that they present **different** policies. A Tory-Lite Labour party isn't appealing to anyone because the Conservatives are already in that role. Labour need to offer the alternative - they are the opposition, they must oppose.

&gt; If you want to be elected you persuade enough people that your policies are correct and that you should be entrusted with the power to implement them.

This is true, but you have it the wrong way around. You don't shape your policies around what you think people want - you shape your policies around what you think to be the best course of action, and then present your case. The people will decide with their votes and if you lose then you lose. That's the democratic ideal, before ego and career ambition gets in the way.

Gerrard's a diplomat who will always put the club first. 

Rodgers has frozen out players he didn't want (who were committee buys) despite the fact that they would've been better for the team, and put his own buys in the squad irrespective of form. Prime examples being Lovren and Allen.

That *shows* that he's putting his own reputation ahead of results.

I'm not even saddling him with the blame for Sterling either. That little cunt was rotten from the get-go.

Rodgers is a fucking chancer. He got found out in the Champions League. He got found out in the league. We're going nowhere with him unless he changes his ways.

HMRC wouldn't send out letters either apologising for an incorrect code unless each customer made an individual complaint, so thats bullshit too. What HMRC do with bulk issues is that they communicate wih the employer directly. When that does happen, call centre staff would be sent instructions informing them of an issue. ""If yl fet a call from a customer who works for so and so, please inform the customer that HMRC are looking into tbe issue - do not change the code"".

So your P11D example would yave fuck all to do with call centre staff - who don't handle paperwork and who don't deal with bulk issues. If in that example call centre staff are telling customers to speak with the payroll its because HMRC and the company are in direct communication and both parties have agreed to solve the issue directly. So, in your P11D example a customer will ahvs been told to speak wih the payroll because both HMRC and the company have mutually agreed to this.

Otherwise, there's plenty of threads on here (I feel as if one pops up every 6 months or so) that talk about the different books and TV specials you can find. 

Off the top for books, here are a few to get you started:

- [**Red or Dead** by David Peace](http://www.amazon.com/Red-Dead-Novel-David-Peace/dp/1612194389) - 700+ pages on Bill Shankly and his tenure at LFC. It's a bit repetitive and written uniquely but I think it's to capture how Shanks was.
- [**An Epic Swindle** - Brian Reade](http://www.amazon.com/An-Epic-Swindle-Months-Cowboys/dp/085738600X) - About how Liverpool nearly went through administration and the Hicks/Gillett era at Liverpool.
- [**44 Years With the Same Bird** - Brian Reade](http://www.amazon.com/Years-With-The-Same-Bird/dp/0330474251/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_y/180-8198410-6481227) - Haven't read this one but it's by the same as above. Apparently about... well... 44 years as a supporter, presumably.
- [**Red Machine** - Simon Hughes](http://www.amazon.ca/Red-Machine-Liverpool-Players-Stories/dp/1780576595) - A good recount by players on what it was like to be at Liverpool during the 1980s. Hilarious commentary at points.


I'm too lazy to run through videos, but as I said, search /r/liverpoolfc for something as simple as ""books"" and sort by top voted all-time. Hope this helps.

You yourself don't even acknowledge it in your reply - the elephant in the room - and go on to some more drivel about loyalism.

I have a Strix 980 that I got for my new build but it doesn't actually fit in my case so I'm selling it.

The box has been opened (From when I tried to get it in the case) but it hasn't actually been used. It still includes all original accessories (Pictures are included of these).

Looking for around £360 (This is 15% lower than the lowest retail price for a new 980 which is almost what this is)

null,null,nifara,null,null,null,"OED definition of ""populist"": A member or adherent of a political party seeking to represent the interests of ordinary people.

If we go with your definition, what evidence do you have that Corbyn is a ""populist""? That he expresses an opinion and feels that his opponents are incorrect?

Corbyn has a good reputation in parliament, and that's because he's a pragmatist in the truest sense - he will work with all partners to achieve what he sees as right. He has worked with members of every party on a wide variety of initiatives over the years, and is respected by both sides of the house for it. His instinct it to get everyone involved and sit around a table until common ground can be found - that's why he was initiating talks with the IRA years before the government decided to go down that route, a route which ultimately led to peace in NI.

If we approach your definition (that Corbyn sticks rigidly to his principles and refuses to compromise, villainising his opponents and factionalising politics) then having democratic input and encouraging a broad church of opinion would fly in the face of that. Also, the logical tangle that suggests we should ignore any attempt he makes for broader consensus as yet *more* evidence he is radical and factionalist is insane. What could he possibly do, if you'll dismiss such things, to prove that he is not ""fanatical""? What *would* have brought more debate? *Why* do you think it's brought more ""fanaticism""?

My point is that though Blair's government did not, ultimately, more towards rail renationalisation, the public was not revolted by that stance. Of course it's not the reason he won, but it would certainly have won over some voters. And the argument that is made by Corbyn's opponents is that his policies will make him unelectable and show his radical nature and "" fanaticism""...

Diakité - the box-to-box man we've lacked for so long? You get that dude running away at pace with the big man up top and the likes of Chery, Phillips or even Hoilett speeding alongside him as options - magic could happen.

Blackwood - looks like you've got a professional workhorse there, with a sprinkling of talent. If he cranks out those kinds of performances in training, I'd imagine Ramsey will give him time from the bench or even a cup runout.

Chery - the gift that Paladini/Sterling bestowed upon us, there's some beautiful technique and deadball competence as mentioned above.

Gladwin - first time I've seen him, looked good, and he seemed to be pretty in tune with the rest of the squad. Maybe slightly overshadowed by coming in with the Asian Cup player of the tournament but looked just as handy as Luongo.

JET - We looked more dangerous with him on the pitch.

Moving the ball up the field - certainly more entertaining than Zamora-ball.

My thinking is that if Myhill is far and away better than Marshall, that'll stamp him for transfer bait come January, and we'd go to Foster/Marshall/Rose. If Foster is less than 100%, loses a step, etc., we can either use Myhill as the starter with Marshall as a third or sell Foster off. If Marshall breaks out, then bully for us, we've got three potential starters, and can take requests in the transfer window.

We've got a stalwart starter with injury downside risk (Foster), a borderline starter needing competition (Myhill), a veteran backup with potential for rebounding (Marshall) and a young pup training in the wings (Rose).

Just consider, Cilla's family might WANT to speak to the press? They might want to tell the world how much they loved her - and I would put money on the outpouring of love, despite the fact she wasn't on TV that much any more, is comforting to them right now. 

A lot of people think you should wait a bit to approach the family, but who decides what an appropriate amount of time is? A day? A week? 

People think journalists can't wait to go knock on that door and get all the juicy details but I can tell you from experience it is daunting every single time, because you never know what you will be met with - luckily every time I've had to do it, the family has welcomed me in and talked all about how wonderful the person they lost was.

null,null,bl4ckfriar,null,null,null,"With regards to how much you'd pay back if you paid the HTB loan off before the 5 years, if I understand the guidelines correctly, it's done on the value of your home at the time you pay back the money.

You have to pay for an independent valuator to value your property, and the minimum repayment is 10% of the home value.

So from that I conclude that you're no better off making early repayments than paying it off in full after the five years, unless you expect the price of your home to increase. If you expect the house price to drop then you'd be better off waiting the 5 years.

For more details read the ""Can I redeem my equity loan in part, sometimes known as “staircasing”?"" question of the HTB equity loan guidelines.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_class

Pretty hard to say that someone who was born to the amount of wealth requiring that you had no compulsion that you would ever work (historical definition of Upper Class). That you were educated at Eton and Oxford and that you mixed in the sort of social circles that meant your school friends are two of the most politically important people in the country (oh and you're the most politically important) and that you married the daughter of a baronet. Yet you're still not Posh. 

People argue over these words forever but your birth to aristocrats only distinction is too narrow for the term Posh as it's commonly used. Also many people born to properly working class families became middle class through grammar schools and university - particularly a few decades ago. Indeed education is a very significant way people move between social classes.

Cameron's family have been very wealthy for going on 200 years. If entrance to the Bullingdom club is not elite enough for your definition of Upper Class than I'm not sure what would be. Oh and by the way Cameron descends from King William IV and his mistress Dorothea Jordan through their illegitimate daughter Lady Elizabeth FitzClarence. I'm pretty sure Cameron is by any reasonable definition Posh.

There are lots of posts here to new riders in your shoes - it might be worth a search if you don't get many replies here. 

In general, Japanese motorcycles are recommended for first time riders. They are reliable, easy to maintain yourself (this is a big part of the fun if you ask me!) and keep their value when you come to sell it. 

I always recommend the only money people spend when I thinking about riding is the fee of the CBT. Don't buy any gear and definitely do not buy a bike. If you really hate your CBT, there is no pressure on you to continue riding then. You need to be relaxed and calm when you ride - that's very important in my view. 

One of the best resources for information and past experiences is /r/MotoUK - but at this time of year, with lots of people out riding and lots of new riders around, you may not get as many replies as you might like.

The majority of aristocratic families originated in the merchant class, and were ennobled between the 14th and the late 19th century.  Those in possession of a hereditary peerage (but not a life peerage)  – for example a Dukedom, a Marquessate, an Earldom, a Viscounty or a Barony – are typically members of the upper class"".

I've said many times, as has the nationalist community. **The Orange Order needs to start chucking out sectarian cunts that ruin their name, and needs to begin dialogue with neighbourhood groups** if they want to achieve walking down any contentious road.

To state clearly (because it seems to fall on deaf ears every time it is said):

* Orange Order throws out *any and all* members caught rioting, saying *anything* sectarian, racist, supremacist etc.

* They talk with neighbourhood groups in contentious areas like Twaddell or the Garvaghy road - rather than just trying to barge down.

* Removal of *all* paramilitary banners from marches.

* Zero tolerance on sectarian tunes being played or sang, or any ""bouncying"" going on.

* Orange order made to pay fines/loss of state funding in instances of rioting and public disorder.

Again, these suggestions have been said *many* times in the public forum, but the OO just flatly decline - thus, intelligent debate is impossible.",null,0,null,1438529815,null,null,1438531005,0,ctox4rg,null,t3_3fhb3s,null,null,null,t1_ctowhrb,null,null,null,1440236698,null,9,null,northernireland,t5_2qlve,9,null

null,null,ex-turpi-causa,,"Radical Centre; 2.94, -4.77",null,"&gt; Also, the logical tangle that suggests we should ignore any attempt he makes for broader consensus as yet more evidence he is radical and factionalist is insane. What could he possibly do, if you'll dismiss such things, to prove that he is not ""fanatical""? What would have brought more debate? Why do you think it's brought more ""fanaticism""?

You're misreading what I wrote. I again am not claiming *he* is fanatical or even that radical. 

&gt; If we approach your definition (that Corbyn sticks rigidly to his principles and refuses to compromise, villainising his opponents and factionalising politics)

If you can point to where I explicitly make this claim, that'd be great. I can then perhaps rephrase what it is you're taking to suggest this. 

&gt; When one of his flagship policies is something the golden child Blair ran on.

I think you're fixated on this for the wrong reasons. It comes back to populism. He's seeking to represent the interests of ordinary people *on the basis that what is popular with them intrinsically makes for sound policy.* Not necessarily the *only* basis, but a significant proportion of it. Either way it keeps coming up in your and the typical examples: what's good = what is popular with the people; what's good = what gets them cheering. This is populism at its most bare, and obvious, even by your dictionary definition. 

*Ultimately it creates this environment that actually stifles debate because it creates an orthodoxy wherein if the masses like it it must therefore be pursued. Not only that but if the masses like it, it therefore makes sense to pursue it as policy (other considerations come later, if they even enter the discourse/debate). Notice how whenever Kendall now speaks, Burnham and Cooper basically shut her down. Notice also how ardent Corbynites react to Kendall. 

This is basically a left wing equivalent of Nigel Farage. At least Corbyn speaks of compromise though. I'm not convinced how far it will go, however. Someone who's keen on and understands compromise probably wouldn't vote against his own party as frequently. 

&gt; that's why he was initiating talks with the IRA years before the government decided to go down that route, a route which ultimately led to peace in NI.

This is also typical romanticism that tends to sort of equate correlation with causation. Regardless of the outcome, if you push for one line long enough it will in some way probably come true, especially with regards war -- there are only ever two outcomes: peace, or worse. 

Good for him for 'seeking peace' and 'negotiation' from day one/early on. There's nothing altogether that remarkable about it. I think had negotiations been feasible when he first started banging that drum, conflict would never have broken out in the first place.

Awful game.

The lineup that we usually do with Oscar at CAM and Fabregas at CM worked brilliantly, and we should have started with that. Over negative Mourinho yet again, and in the fucking community shield.

null,null,TrickyDickNixonbot,,Labour Neocon,null,"&gt; Tht is phenomenally narrow minded. If the lessons of history show us anything it is that the next great idea almost certainly will originate in a movement calling for violent revolution. The principles of liberalism themselves originate from such radicalism.

Once again, this is fallacious (and wrong). Firstly, assuming this is completely true, you're assuming history is on some linear, unchanging path that constantly resembles or repeats previous scenarios. Never before have we had a representative, democratic society like we have now, never before have calls for violent revolution been rendered totally moot by the fact totally democratic structures *already exist* when they did not when these previous revolutions happened. Second, a lot of countries willingly reformed towards democracy over time and not via violent revolution, with violent revolutions (I.E. France) actually flopping more often than not.

&gt; The Labour Party (which was part of the Labour Movement) decided to enagge with the existing political framework, but the Labour Movement as a whole instead chose to act through agitation, industrial actions and so on. The only reason they became less prominent was that the democratic wing (the LP) began to gain ground.

So the reason Communism/radicalism failed is because democratic structures achieved the same objectives much more peacefully and much more successfully? Shocking! I thought you were disagreeing with me?

&gt; Until that point the movement was still driven by, and achieved the majority of its success through, action not based upon the principles of the society they were attempting to change.

Erm, might wanna check your history there. Aside from industrial disputes and working conditions victories, something that even relatively right-wing unions (see: The USA) have achieved, widespread legislation for these things ultimately had nothing to do with revolutionary socialist ideology, and actually more arose in the veins of paternalistic conservatism and liberal values. As for ""majority of its success"", the establishment of the welfare state, the NHS and the nationalisations by Labour were clearly immense failures and demonstrate how shit parliamentary democratic processes are.

That's generally how things pan out when the losing team make tactical adjustments. At least in our case anyway, we always look better in the second half.

null,null,gamas,null,null,null,"&gt; What I find weird about this article, and your response to this article, is the repeated assertion that the Corbyn faction is pursuing ideological purity and will somehow wipe anything but their perfect vision from the party. What I find truly weird about that is how it has been made explicitly clear this is not the case. Corbyn, in fact, is strongly pushing to return a number of functions back to democratic mechanisms. That means he doesn't want to pick his shadow cabinet, but have them voted for (for example). He's made it abundantly clear he's happy to work with those across he broad church, that he values and prizes the broad church, and that he wants dissent, discussion and compromise.

The problem is (and the one that has caused me much anguish as a Corbyn supporter) that a significant chunk of Corbyn's SUPPORTERS don't realise this, and are likely to be massively disappointed when he actually does start compromising. How many times has Corbyn's campaign had to remind people not to go calling other party members Tories only to be completely ignored. Hell, Diane Abbott made a speech laughing at Ed Balls and making threatening comments towards the Progress group in the same meeting that Jeremy spoke about how we should address policies, not personalities and that we should all be comradely to our fellow party members regardless of their views.

I think leaping left would be a bad idea, because the last time the UK had a choice between hard left and hard right, it went right (Thatcher), and I can't see that changing.

I have no idea what libcom.org is - this is history you can find a hundreds of sources and records.

If you are *not* saying that those ideologies are not responsible thwn I apologise for misrepresenting you, but you absolutely did say that reform originated in Liberalism and paternalistic conservativism, and I must strenuously disagree.

However, this all leads away from the original point - whatever the reforms the LP instituted, they were not the ""next great idea"". They were refinements and adjustments of ideas that were first propagated by those who *were* advocating revolution. My point is that the next big great idea is very likely to originate in the same way - conceptualised by radicals who push for revolution, and then implemented organically and incrementally.

The topic is about the origins of those ideas and those ideas, by their nature, are radical. If you crack down on radicalism you will, inevitably, be cracking down on the groups who are most likely to originate these concepts, even if they are not likely to actually implement them.

I really do think that this game showed our inherent weaknesses with Ramires starting in place of a creative midfielder. I think Oscar should have started, and personally, I think Falcao should have played the first 45 instead of the ladder. 

For me, Matic and Willian played well, Ramires, Ivanovic, and Remy did not. Falcao wasn't great, but he created more problems for their defense than Remy did. 

Transfer market wise, I can take it or leave it so to speak. While we could go and buy an alternate box-to-box midfielder, I prioritize finishing signing Baba Rahman as a back up to Cesar. After balancing our back 4, I would like to further add some depth, but that's just my opinion. 

Overall, it seems that we were largely unfit, but I do see this pre-season as a learning experience.

Grr. So many employers say this but few actually deliver. For a start, 'training and development' can mean anytbing any many companies just see offering this as a box to tick off rather than a genuine desire to train up people. Often 'training and development' is minor and does not offer any real benefits to an employee. Secondly, with less management there is less opportunity for promotion. So offering trsining and development can just further underemployment.

The idea of a socialist revolution came along with a man called Karl Marx, and we all know how fantastically successful Marxist revolutions were, dont we? Oh wait.

Im saying the first wave of labour-friendly legislation under Disraeli was the result of paternalistic conservatism, and later things like early pensions were the result of Lloyd George and the liberals. While the militant socialists achieved nothing on the political scene, and at best just augmented the ranks of strikes and industrial strife (which is something totally separate from politics), when a democratic political party arose, the Labour Party, to advocate for socialist ideas, widespread reform and success finally manifested. This is no coincidence. In fact, one of the most influential documents in the Labour Party has been 'The Future of Socialism', which explicitly condemns radical and militant socialism for a pacifist and reconcilliatory type. 

The overwhelming evidence of history demonstrates that calls for the overthrow of democracy, a system the likes of which has never existed before, not only lead to mass-murder, repression and tyranny when actually implemented (see: every Fascist and Communist state, as well as the variety of other socialist states in Libya, Madagascar, Egypt, Iraq, Burma, etc) but are completely regressive proposals, dragging us back in time, not forward.

null,null,Rosti_LFC,lfc93,,null,"I don't agree so much with Comolli's point that we've overhauled the squad again this season. Yes, we've brought in a fair number of new players, but I think the spine of the team, in particular when everyone is fit, is still the same core. We lack some proper stalwarts aside from Skrtel, but the likes of Henderson, Skrtel, Mignolet,  Coutinho and Sturridge have all been at the club a few years now, and I'd expect most of the regular XI to have been around at least 12 months. At the very least I don't feel like we're overhauling our first XI in key positions this summer to the extent we did last year. 

The age aspect is worrying for our title aspirations this season, but only on the assumption we were going to have any. Ignoring that, I think it puts us in reasonably good stead for the future. Even without holding onto every player as they mature, I think so long as we keep most of them, and the ones we do sell are for good money (e.g. Sterling) it'll pull us back up towards the top of the table over time. Plus I don't think we'd have ever gotten anywhere trying to bankroll established talent because we just don't have the finances for it.

I also add a little tea tree essential oil to my cleansing oil to help with spots, but only a little, a teaspoon or two per 100ml of carrier oil at most, as pure tea tree oil can cause chemical burns and other skin irritation if used in too high a concentration.

Leaving the dirty oil on after oil cleansing can also cause spots, using a gentle foaming cleanser to remove the leftover oil can help to reduce acne.

You are 15 and in the middle of your exam years.

Would you still be able to attend the same school? If you don't need to change schools would it be a massive hassle to get to school from your dads house? 

You may not be thinking far ahead but if your schooling gets messed around at this stage would you want to leave with no exams and no prospects and burden your dad with your unemployable ass?

You want to have a stronger bond with your dad and I totally get that. Use skype, call him every night and keep that connection going so that when the weekend comes you can do stuff.

I understand how you feel but from the adults side of things there are always other factors to consider.

I moved with my daughter away from her dad. He will always have access to her by phone, on Skype and she spends most school holidays with him. She often says she'd like to live with him and I have to point out the realities to her.

I'm a bitch. I make her keep her room tidy, I monitor her phone usage, her time on the internet, her bedtimes etc. Her dad buys her crap and takes her places and bedtime is whenever they fall asleep... because it's a holiday.

if she lived with him he would be the one moaning about her pants on the floor, nagging her to brush her teeth or to be home in time for dinner and I'd be the one doing stuff and taking her to the park or the movies.

She understands and agrees with me that she'd be just as sad about not being with me if she lived with him so we do what we can to make sure they have immediate access to each other by whatever means available.

I timed our move to cause as little disruption to her education as possible because that's my biggest concern for her and her future. When she is has completed her compulsory education and is looking at college etc then she can make that choice to move to be with her dad and I'd support that but her education must come first.

Discuss this with your parents. Seriously think about your schooling and what any effects will be and show that you are looking at this sensibly, with an eye on your future and not just on your short term happiness. If you think your mum will accuse your dad of putting words in your mouth you need to show her how much thought you have put into this request.

I've been through this from both sides, as the child and now, as the parent and it's a tough conversation to have with a lot of tears involved.

For starters when we sold Suarez we knew that the squad needed depth. It was too light and needed more manpower in the right places. 

The buying this season was to augment specific holes in the squad. Milner was as close to a SG replacement as possible. Benteke and Firmino are meant to bring goals, the goals we missed so much last season. Clyne is meant to replace Johnson.

To give the impression that we are just spending on a new squad again is, well it just plain incorrect. 

And as for all the Tomkins Graphs and Tomkins Numbers, fair enough, numbers rarely lie but in my experience they equally never show the full picture.

null,null,MyNamesNick,lfc68,,null,"Letting him go on loan when we are going to be managing an absolute shite ton of games this year would be a very very big mistake. He will get game time this season. Even if he doesnt have a role to play in the first team at this very moment, there will be games for him in europa league and the domestic cups, there is no doubt about that. That is were he needs to find his rhythm. Ibe has played better than him this preseason (which can be very misleading), whereas markovic played at a much higher level at a different club in a different league, so it is hard to say one is ""clearly"" better than the other. 

I'm sorry you didn't get to watch him in sevilla. He is a quality player. He is still young and coming into a team that had/has massive defensive issues, you cannot expect him to just tidy it all up on his own. Language barrier may be an underlying issue as well. Also the left side of our field is probably our weakest point (not entirely down to moreno) and the fact that he is a more attacking full back doesn't really help that sides defensive issues either. He will become more defensively disciplined and an overall better player this year, im sure. 

Gomez has had his fair share of mistakes this preseason and everyone is seeming to be overlooking them because he does look very promising at 18. but we are playing against very weak sides for the most part and preseason has shown to be a very very poor indication of not only a player's ability (see aspas, suso, lovern, etc) or a team's ability (stomped dortmund last year).

Once installed, you can enter the AceStream addresses into the URL bar of your browser and it should open the stream up in AceStream.

As for finding AceStream addresses and plenty of flash streams for that matter, I'd suggest checking r/soccerstreams 15 minutes or so before kick-off.

Actually I don't but the arguments that argue that Corbyn is unelectable can be just as easily applied to the other 3 candidates who look and act like political automatons with no discernible principles.

&gt;Whatever he says, people... won't... trust him.

Perhaps not. It is better to be a party of principles as opposed to a party that will be anything so long as they're in charge. That's just power for powers sake and the more Labour emulate the Conservatives the more that's being noted.

&gt; And not only that, they'll see no reason to trust him. He's completely unlike them. They won't even give him the time to hear what he's got to say. 

How are any of the other 3 slightly like them? Because Yvette's a mother? Jeremy Corbyn is a father. Yvette is also the wife of a pretty reviled politician and represents status quo.

&gt;

It's called a representative democracy for a reason. The representatives ought to represent the people. People oughta see a likeness to themselves in their representatives. Oughta see a similarity of interests (eg, kids, spouse, looks and acts normal, other worries). **And being Christian still matters, or at least being someone they could picture in a church**.

It really doesn't. This is not America. 

I have no idea how you think the public thinks that politicians act normal. They don't at all. The public famously buys not at all into the talking down to them by politicians.

&gt;Whot the hell is Corbyn?! another London liberal, just like Miliband. Yvette at least could appeal to the North. 

Corbyn, being to the left of Yvette could appeal to the north more than her.",null,0,null,1438539302,null,null,false,0,ctp20zw,null,t3_3fe874,null,null,null,t1_ctoygv9,null,null,null,1440239071,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Not really. The BNP have always been working class and UKIP won their support there from their position on immigration and the fact that no-one in many parts of the north would ever vote Conservative.

What left-wing policies of recent years, except perhaps excluding immigration, do you think Labour ostracized their northern base support?

&gt;Corbyn is a serial divorcee, now married to a Mexican. Trotsky much?! George Galloway much?! Nick Clegg much?! 

What the hell does Corbyn's divorces have to do with Trotskyism, Nick Clegg or George Galloway? What the hell does his wife being Mexican have to do with anything? Ignoring the fact that multiple politicians have been caught out having affairs including Paddy Ashdown, John Major and Boris Johnson.

&gt;And people want someone with ""no discernible principles"". They don't want an ideologue who'll throw the country under the bus for the sake of some pipe dream ideology. They want a pragmatist who cares for what matters; family, kids, worries of families with kids, etc. 

I should have gone further. They don't just lack principles, they lack personality and give the distinct impression that all they care about is power. Almost no-one trusts politicians of any party and expect them to say anything if they think it will gain them support and those 3 political drones have nothing going for them.

He'll get some time but not enough to help him develop. He won't get a stretch of matches, game after game of consistently playing 90 minutes, which is what he needs to regain his confidence and form. 

For me, Ibe is clearly better suited to the PL atm. Markovic needs to bulk up &amp; needs to pushed centrally b/c that's where he belongs. 

I hope you're right, but I'd still like to give Gomez a chance in the beginning of the season to see what he's about. Mistakes?

That is very true. I hope they come good as you say, particularly Moreno b/c he's got all the traits to be a great modern day wing/fullback with his pace &amp; tenacity, just needs that defensive discipline &amp; he can be our LB for the next decade.

The two players are so different in quality, and in their performances for Spurs, only a mad man would drop Zokora over Capoue?

But Lennon and VdV is a valid comparison? That AVB flogged VdV (without giving him any chance mind you), is the equivalent of Poch giving Lennon 10+ games and a half season to prove himself?

Young man, I am sorry, but I have to report you to the footballing authorities...

Joking aside. Lennon is a fine squad player. As was Zokora. I like them both. But there is nothing ""insane"" about Poch preferring Townsend and Lamela over Lennon. I think Lennon could still be a squad player for us, but he is done as top-winger: He doesn't have any confidence to beat players anymore, he was told to learn how to cross in 2006--never got the hang of it, and he still shoots like my little sister.
