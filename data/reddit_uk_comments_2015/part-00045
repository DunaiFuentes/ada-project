In spite of what you think, you have absolutely no idea or understanding of what my overall perceptions of the club are, and apparently little to no understanding of how organizations function within the league. Please stop talking about Southampton as if you had any idea about what their business plan was, is or ever has been. The fact of the matter is that they built an organization designed to operate profitably at the top of the premier league while they were in the lower leagues. Their position relative to us had no bearing on the calibre of their organization relative to ours. They have refined and strengthened that organization each and every year, going from strength to strength. They took a very sensible long lensed view on how to do that. They had a plan, and they implemented it. What Koeman said to the press is completely irrelevant. What would you have him say?

By contrast our club has spent the last 15 years being passed around from one group of bumbling businessmen to another. Whatever antiquated but successful infrastructure we had got completely dismembered in a very short period of time. We were literally weeks from insolvency when the Dave's placed their bid (and while Southampton were implementing their winning plan).
The current owners have solidified the infrastructure in fits and starts, but they are heading in the right direction, generally speaking, even if they have made some expensive and farcical errors along the way. The club is changing quickly, but we need to maintain a level of stability to ensure future growth. It's risk management. It's about choosing when to make your challenge. 

I'm not going to address  the bulk of what you've written about 'striving' and 'failing' and 'accepting' etc. in the last couple of paragraphs. I don't think it's worth it. I don't think you have a realistic grasp on what it takes to compete within the several different strata of the league. And I'll say it again, I've supported this club since 1973. I know what failure is. We're not failing right now. We are succeeding. I don't agree with many of Sam's recent tactical or selection choices. I was angry with his handling of last season's transfers and the way he had to handle our season because of his mishandling of transfers. But unlike you, I have no knowledge of what happens behind closed doors at the club and am limited to judge the side and the club's progress based on the information I have at hand. And with that information I know this, we are a solid to good side who on its day is capable of beating any other. We lack depth and we do not yet have the resources to successfully compete for Champion's League spots. At the onset of each match, I hope and expect that we will win. I am disappointed if we do not win. But I am not going to be naive enough to call a loss at, eg, Anfield to a resurging  Liverpool a failure. That's absurd and it's juvenile. We have a side that on paper and on the ledger is a 6th through 10th place side. I hope we finish higher. I will not foolishly decry failure if we finish 7th. We're on the right track. Frankly, anyone that claims a finish out of the top 4 is a failure needs to have a good look at themselves. If you need that immediate fix right now, then perhaps you're not cut out to support this side. West Ham will be a top 5 side soon, when the time is right. Soon.

Of course the cuts are ideological.

We all want a prosperous nation with less suffering for its people. The Conservatives have an ideological stance on how this can be achieved do they not?

I don't think the cuts are an efficient way to raise the money we need. The targeting of where the money has come from has provably affected the poor and disabled more. We are literally being told to eat porridge by people in government while they refuse to get a cheaper caterer because the champagne will be worse.

null,false,drunkWisconinbly,null,null,null,"Interesting to think about however I do not think we could pull this off, especially against the tougher teams that Walters.  Why?

 -  Neither Ki, nor Shelvey, nor Sig offer us any pace on the outside and we've had to do a lot of countering on tougher teams this season.Therefore, I think we would need at least one winger on the field to offer us pace on the outside.

 -  Walter's bases his tactics off Chelsea's set up which has three number 10s ahead of the holding mids.  However, Hazard, Oscar, and Willian are close to the hardest workers on the team covering a lot of ground every game.  For the Swans to be able to copy that our three number 10s would have to do likewise and we all know Shelvey has no interest in a high work rate and it doesn't appear to me that Sig has the stamina to put in that work.

However, his claims that Shelvey would have difficulty being dropped and that both Britton and Ki are integral to the team are correct.  

This is what I would do if I was Monk once Sig is off supension and (if) we have a full squad to select from.

I would have Shelvey keep his currect place of playing behind Gomis and slide Sig out to right wing and give him freedom to roam.  Kyle will give us the width we need on that side.  Then have Routledge on the left to provide pace and trickery. The two holding mids would then be Ki and Cork who can both cover a lot of area and feed the three in front of them.  Put Cork on the Right side to have him hold more to help cover the more advanced Kyle.  Then around the 60 min mark allow Montero (who I feel has been at his best coming off the bench) and Barrow to really put the opposition fullbacks under pressure.  Or if we are leading we can bring on Dyer and Britton (which will then push Ki into the front three and have Britton hold with Cork).  Or if Carroll continues form bring on Carroll and put him in the front three and keep Ki and Cork as the holding.

What most concerns people is that there doesn't seem to be any concrete definition of what an 'English only' matter even is. For example, matters of how services are funded in England have a direct effect on the budgets of the devolved governments due to how the Barnett formula works, so a vote on the funding of the NHS in England is in fact of great importance to Scotland and Wales, as it will affect their budgets. 

Without proper separation of powers (something that hasn't been discussed whatsoever) you would either see a situation where Scottish and Welsh MPs are barred from voting on matters that despite being primarily of importance to England, still have a direct effect on Scotland and Wales, or you would see no practical change given that important matters that have no direct effect outside of England are fairly few and far between; most English matters will continue to be British matters for as long as the British parliament also serves as the English one.

It is fairly clear that Britain needs some political reform, but EVEL isn't it. EVEL a populist 'common sense' policy designed to appeal to people who feel under-represented, without actually giving them better representation.

&gt;In 1953, the Wire contacted the owner, Mr Magpie, making him sell television sets cheaply as part of her plan to ""tak[e] people's faces, their essences"" and get a physical body. (TV: *The Idiot's Lantern*)
Although Magpie himself was killed by the Wire, Magpie Electricals survived the loss of its proprietor, and continued to exist well past the 1950s.
&gt;In October 1963, the First Doctor visited Magpie's Electricals and attempted to buy components to repair the TARDIS. (AUDIO: *Hunters of Earth*)
&gt;River Song's scanner was manufactured by Magpie Electricals. (TV: *Day of the Moon*)

Prior to 2001 Gaddafi was an enemy of the British government. The BBC used the terms ""dictator"" and ""regime"" most of the time to refer to them. Most stories were about issues that made Libya look bad. 

Around 2003 Gaddafi became a friend of the British government. The BBC suddenly started referring to him as a ""leader"" of the ""Libyan Government"". They started publishing reports about grand water purification schemes and about his improvements to Libyan literacy &amp; higher education.

In 2009 America decided to back a coup and sent in their own CIA guy to lead the rebels. Once again on the BBC Gaddafi became the ""dictator"" of the ""Libyan regime"". Endless stories were printed about any possible negative aspect of Libya. Public consensus was created for intervention and once again we went to war.

You can repeat this with any country that the UK has had a changing relationship with. Egypt is a good example. BBC News is useful only as a yardstick on the UK Governments outlook.

He spent a year of his prime, when he could have started in the Prem, in the championship with us, on a 50% wage cut. Worked his ass off. There's a reason we went up, because we had premiership quality striker in the championship. The play off final proves that. What other championship striker could have controlled that and finished. Then he had the awareness to tip the ball to RVT to win us the match. One of our most important players, ever. He's gotten along with every manager we have ever had. When he eventually retires, after snagging that goal record for us, I want him to be given an ambassadors role at the club. What player embodies west ham more? It's Carlton, hands down.

null,false,Peli-cant,null,null,null,"I don't think that Siggy has the pace to play as a defensive winger, which is part of the reason why he was ineffective on the left wing at Tottenham.  If we had Ki, Siggy, and Shelvey in the attacking midfield, I could only foresee Ki getting back to defend consistently.   

If I we really wanted to add to our midfield without weakening defensively we could play 4 in a diamond like this: http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=60j4.

And I can't get my defensive lineup to generate a url, but defensively, Ki would sit deep in front of the centerbacks as he has done well this season while Siggy and Cork drop back to sit in front of him.  What'd we have is a zonal triangle composing of Ki and the CB's in the middle, with Taylor, Siggy, Cork, and Naughton applying pressure on the outside, with the CM's in a position from where one could assist on the flanks while the other covered in the center.  This way, each flank could be covered by a CM and a fullback, while the center is always covered by the triangle and a CM.  This is hard to explain well without an image, but it is a lot like how Arsenal defended against Man City, the only difference being the front three.  

What I like about my formation is that offensively it allows Naughton space on the right flank to operate, meaning that we don't need a right winger, which we're short on due to injury.  It also allows us to use four center midfielders instead of three, but it still leaves the opportunity for a left winger.  My four center midfielders are arranged in a diamond, with Sigurdsson in a deep lying position that allows him creative space further ahead with opportunities to distribute to Montero, Shelvey, or Gomis.  Ki sits in front of the defense, where he benefits defensively, but he can move forward to occupy the space left by Sigurdsson, providing an outlet if Siggy doesn't have attacking options.  In the attacking midfield role that he played well in on Sunday, Shelvey is linked with Gomis, who he worked well with.  Cork is on the right, where he can drop back to cover for Naughton (as drunkWisconinbly suggested).  Essentially this diamond rotates to utilize the talents of all four midfielders.  Gomis is off to the right a bit, where he provides attacking support for Naughton but also allows space for Montero to slash in on the left towards the far post.  Here, Gomis can hold up the ball, and lay off to Shelvey, who has long shot capability, or to Naughton, who can cross to Montero, the far post runner.  Taylor tucks into a defensive position on the left, because there isn't much cover on his side.  

To answer your question though, no, I don't think Siggy could play as a defensive winger.  However, above is a solution in which we could both protect the flanks, but also increase our number of center midfielders.  Sorry for the ramble.

&gt;Craig shared a flat with his friend Mark, and worked in a call centre. By 2009, he met Sophie, whom he was romantically attracted; they build up a friendship and spent Fridays together, usually consisting of ""pizza, booze, telly."" Craig wanted to confess his feelings, but could never find the courage to tell Sophie.
&gt;When Mark received an inheritance from a previously unknown uncle and moved out, Craig placed an advert for a flatmate in a local shop window. The Doctor turned up on his doorstep later that day, thanks to a helpful note from a future Amy Pond. Since Amy was stuck in the TARDIS with no way to land it on her own and the Doctor knew the trouble was in the upstairs flat of Craig's building, he wanted to live there.

There are two major problems with that assertion.

1) It's a lie.

Huge volumes of research have been done. We're good on that point. Seriously. Doing enough research before acting is what science does these days.

2) A church near me has had a paragraph in their newsletter for the past few months under the heading ""GENETICALLY MODIFIED BABIES"". In spite of the fact that this treatment involves literally no modification to the genome at all. So I guess that'd be lie number two. And yes, that heading was in all caps. None of the other headings were like that.

They were urging people to write to the local MP opposing this stuff. At no point was research, or the need for more thereof, ever mentioned.

The rule is designed to ensure transparency. While such an agreement is unusual, a similar deal was struck between Manchester United and Fulham for Chris Smalling in January 2010 which set out the defender’s £10m move to Old Trafford six months later.

Smalling never played against United in that time, however, while Ings is set to face Liverpool when Burnley visit Anfield in a month.

However, I would add that in my opinion, it's less guilt driven than it is due to not only a need to keep a balance of power in the Middle East, the ludicrous amounts of arms deals the US gets out of Israel, and the high relative prevalence of those of Jewish descent in positions of power and money, especially in America.

We simply cannot afford to have the kind of bench that they have and declare a profit at the end of the season. Real Madrid have the best squad in the world. NOBODY can be Ronaldo or Bale. Its almost impossible. Benzema v Costa is a tie? A monkey could score goals for Real Madrid with the supply he gets. Costa takes it. James v Oscar is a tie if you were strictly talking about how well each one performs his role. Kroos+James+ Modric will get killed by a bigger side in Europe unless Illaramendi, Khedira or Lucas Silva play in midfield.

As you can see from the other thread his dribbling and creativity stats are up there with the best of them for this league. He is also slightly younger and English so he should fit right in with our young squad.

Borini for me is one of those poachers who basically needs a clear cut chance to convert it because he can't beat defenders on his own. On top of that he doesn't combine well with our attacking players at all, he actually ruins many good opportunities as I'm sure you've already noticed. Bottom line, I think he simply lacks ability, he tries to overcompensate for that with his enthusiasm and workrate but it's not working out at all, we don't need another Kuyt to mess up the flow of our attacking moves.

Don't worry about buying a striker who is on par with Sturridge, if Mario doesn't work out we will get one of those. Remains to be seen whether Lambert will stay after summer as well. Ings will be our 3rd/4th choice and I am perfectly fine with that unless we find a better prospect. Don't forget that this will probably be a bargain signing since his contract is running out so it's extremely low risk, we can even make money on him even if he doesn't work out.

OK, fair enough. My mistake.

Nevertheless, how would a police officer be lawfully on the premises of an ISP or telco? They can't just walk into random data centres and start confiscating servers. They need a warrant to enter private premises before they can exercise their section 19 powers, and even then they can only seize items that are connected with the specific offence in question.

It seems to me that it is pretty difficult to make a principled argument against a particular method of slaughter when you aren't simultaneously making the same argument against many other cruel practices which are routinely practiced by abattoirs of all stripes.

If you look at Animal Aid's [campaign page](http://www.animalaid.org.uk/h/n/CAMPAIGNS/slaughter/ALL///) you'll see that they have recorded abuse in nine other slaughterhouses in the UK over the past five years. I don't know if that's representative or not (maybe 10% of slaughterhouses are halal, so it is no surprise that 10% of bad slaughterhouses are halal), but it does suggest that the problem is not limited to one particular method of slaughter, it is a function of inadequate oversight of the industry generally.",null,0,null,1423040838,null,0,false,0,coargof,null,t3_2um5ej,null,t1_coargof,null,t1_coacmcd,null,null,null,1424216016,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

No it's much easier for big business to lobby a national govt. or the EU.  What do you think is easier, lobbying one government or a hundred?  Think how difficult it would be if this group had to lobby every council in Britain not to ban these pesticides.  Sure, they could convince some, but the truth would out because the honest councils would expose it.  

Local businesses have an interest in lobbying local government obviously.  And yes, corruption by them would be easier if power was devolved.  But it's also good for the country if small businesses have more influence as they are the drivers of economic growth.  At the moment they have very little say as power is all held way above the level they can afford to lobby.  

&gt;Thats why countries like India, China and Brazil have such massive problems with corruption because people at the bottom and middle are easy to bribe and the people at the top are pretty much powerless to stop some local police chief or mayor in the middle of nowhere taking a bribe.

No, it's because corruption is endemic in these countries at every level.  Look at the corruption that's happening in Tower Hamlets, Westminster is doing it's job and quashing it because we live in a first world democracy.  If we devolved more power downward would we have more corruption at a local level - sure, but central government would do it's job and deal with most of it.

The basis of all power in the UK derives from the ability to raise taxes and control spending. The so called power of the purse.

If you don't have an equal say in how money is spent then you aren't an equal partner in the UK political system.

EVEL as it stands proposes to remove the ability of Scotland (and maybe Wales, it has never been clear what the intent for other devolved regions is) to vote on devolved areas that have huge budgetary impact. This effectively means that England would realistically control the nation without restriction. Take for instance the sudden fascination with local taxation. England could without contest reduce UK spending on the NHS to 0 and then raise local English taxation to cover it.

Honestly losing this control is a much, much bigger issue than some petty issue over tuition fees.

The first thing is that I said offensive weapons *and* s.5 firearms. Not ""offensive weapons (s.5 articles)""

I was referring to normal belt kit plus the fact that a non trivial percentage of officers carry s.5 pistols and rifles.

You jumped in and said that CS was not a firearm. So what? I was referring to belt kit *plus* firearms.

The irony however is that CS actually *is* a firearm under S.5.

&gt; Section 5 (1) (b) any weapon of whatever description designed or adapted for the discharge of any noxious liquid gas or other thing.

That is why CS is illegal - it has an irritant effect on contact/when inhaled which is deemed ""noxious"". UK legal ""Bouncer sprays"" simply stink and contain UV dye, or are just sticky red paint with no active irritant ingredient.

You then went on to post this incomprehensible drivel:
&gt; You specifically referenced 'S5 firearms', when articles under that section of the Firearms Act are, by their very nature, not firearms. If they were firearms, they'd not be in S5.

I don't know what you were smoking when you tried to claim that articles under S.5 of the Firearms Act were - by their nature - not firearms. Well, by definition (legal, if not dictionary) they are, and most people would indeed recognise pistols and machine guns as firearms!

&gt; Using? or ABusing?

&gt; It strikes me that if you provide an exemption, you can't very well complain if it gets used, even if the scope of it isn't what you imagined it would be. 

Oh no, and this is standard form for the Police - they get a power and they test the edges, see how far they can push it until someone cries foul.

Well someone has, and the British Court System has deemed that indeterminate retention of data on a blanket basis is unlawful and have confirmed that the Police are subject to the same DPA principles as the rest of us. In some cases it may be easy to justify retention. In others it is indefensible.

However, the Police appear to be ignoring this and doing their damnedest to drag their heels and not comply for as long as possible. We're well used to Police seeing how far they can stretch the interpretation of laws, but the courts *have now have determined the scope of it* and the Police seem determined to carry on regardless.

Reticence to do as instructed as ordered by a court does not imply good faith or curry the Police any favour with the general public - which is an odd thing to do since public faith in the Police seems to be at an all time low, and the Police only do their jobs by public consent. Most crimes would be very difficult to prosecute without some level of public and witness cooperation, so it does them no favours to go all defensive and stick their fingers in their ears when someone calls out ethically dubious practices. Simply shouting ""prevention and detection"" is just cynical, as though that is a magic card they can play to make the scrutiny go away.

The former is the cause of the latter. Society is great at objectifying evil after the fact, no-one wants to be called a Nazi and so they don't hate on Jews... the problem is no-one seems to have actually understood the lesson of the Holocaust; that is, negative sentiment against an minority or ethnicity can be turned into hate and dehumanisation... it's pretty much the point George Lucas was making with Yoda when he said the line ""Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering"".

Before 1933 Jewish people across [Europe](http://www.antisemitism.org.il/eng/Anti-Semitism) and [Russia](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/pogroms.html) were seen with equal disdain and sometimes treated worse than immigrants are in the UK now... *they can't be trusted, they're ruining our businesses, a drain on the economy etc*... Hitler seized on those fears and took them to the next level (but not before Russia had expelled Jews, Poland and the Ukraine had slaughtered them, and in France Jews could expect the same level of treatment as a black man in 1960's Alabama).

Some say the holocaust was the [culmination of antisemitism in Europe](http://www.holocaust-education.dk/baggrund/antisemitisme.asp). Regardless, I think the holocaust was what caused many other European countries to have a self-revelation and realise that the Jews were people and shouldn't be treated like vermin.

Yet they still neglect to make the crucial logical leap that no group of people should be treated with such disdain.

I don't think UKIP are the modern day Nazi party, I don't think they'd go as far as gassing muslims or immigrants... but I worry they will edge the far right fringes along on a wave of anti-people sentiment and make conditions in this country ripe for a later Nazi-styled party and demographic to rise.",null,0,null,1423042850,null,0,false,0,coarvj1,null,t3_2unpiy,null,t1_coarvj1,null,t1_coalzai,null,null,null,1424215656,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

**[West Ham 8 - 1 Newcastle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpTuAe5brG0), April 21, 1986.**

West Ham put 8 goals past Newcastle as Alvin Martin scored a hattrick against three different goalkeepers. 

**[West Ham 5 - 4 Bradford](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohOWcE7yeTE), February 12, 2000.**

West Ham triumphed over Bradford City in a game that saw Shaka go off injured very early on. Stephen Bywater, our teenaged, third choice keeper had to go on and had a terrible day of it.

We were trailing 4-2 with 25 minutes to go, and took the lead with 6 minutes to go.

This game also featured: 

* Di Canio demanding to be substituted after having around three penalty shouts being turned down. 
* Di Canio and Lampard arguing over who would take a penalty
* A rare goal (and screamer) from John Moncur.

**[Chelsea 2 - 3 West Ham](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RzDxvG73pk), September 28, 2002.** 
A season that every West Ham fan would rather forgot (relegated on a record high 42 points) also saw West Ham's last double over Chelsea (It was also their last season before Abramovich bought the club... probably not a coincidence). 

The game was marked by the ability of two Italians. A soft penalty to Chelsea was cancelled out by Jermain Defoe at the end of the first half, but the second half saw all the action. Three minutes after half time, Di Canio scored one of the goals of his career with a 30 yard volley. Gianfranco Zola scored a fantastic free kick to equalise with 15 minutes to go before Di Canio thumped home the winner from a tight angle with just 5 minutes to go. The win was West Ham's first of the season in a year that was truly heartbreaking.  


**[Arsenal 2 - 3 West Ham](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsoLEtn5jR0), February 1, 2006.**

West Ham's last ever trip to Highbury saw them become the last ever away team to win at Arsenal's ground. West Ham took an early 2-0 lead thanks to Reo Coker and Zamora. Pires pulled one back for the Gunners before Etherington finished the game in the 80th minute. Arsenal scored a late consolation goal, but failed to equalize. 

**[West Ham 4 - 0 Manchester United](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wfn5KREZ8E), November 30, 2010.**

Bottom of the table West Ham destroyed Manchester United to book a place in their first League Cup Semi Final for 20 years. Johnathon Spector, playing out of position in midfield, scored his first two goals in English football against his first club before a double from Cole in the second half finished the rout. 

Victor Obinna was scintillating throughout the match

**[West Ham 2 - 1 Millwall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUN3JJPzdf4), February 4, 2012**

Top of the table West Ham were looking to go five points clear at the top of the Championship when hated rivals Millwall came to visit. The match had a somewhat eerie feel to it as, for safety concerns, the away fans were given the entire top tier of the Sir Trevor Brooking stand.

West Ham's chances took a huge blow when Captain Kevin Nolan was sent off for a two-footed challenge just 9 minutes into the match. None the less, the game was a fairly open affair, with both sides having chances. When a goal did come, it was the home fans who were the happier set. On the verge of half time, Reid headed a ball high into the six yard box and Carlton Cole reacted first to head the ball past David Forde.

Millwall managed to equalise with a stunning strike midway through the second half, but the teams were level for only a short amount of time. A West Ham corner was cleared off the line. Tomkins pumped the ball back in to the box, Forde punched the ball clear (and was also taken out by Faubert) but only as far as Winston Reid, who volleyed the ball into the back of the net to send the crowd into raptures. The home side held on for a famous victory and West Ham held on to first spot for another week.

**[Tottenham Hotspur 0 - 3 West Ham](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZeaEpZYDug), October 6, 2013**
West Ham went to White Harte Lane trapped in the relegation zone, with no away goals in the season and going up against a Spurs side who'd only conceded 3 goals all season. When the Irons did eventually take the lead it was very much against the run of play and with a very good bit of luck. Reid climbed highest to head the ball goalward, it deflected off his own captain and back into his path which he then turned into the net. Three minutes later, West Ham made it 2-0 with even more luck. Vaz Te, through on goal, could only make a tame shot that Lloris saved. However the ball deflected back onto Vaz Te, over the goalkeeper and into the back of the net.

West Ham's 3rd was all class though. Ravel Morrison showed his obvious ability to score a fantastic goal to leave West Ham in dreamland.

Once we've done that, we could look into attaching multiple buses together so we could fit more people in at one go.  Like the buses could all pull up to the station, and people could have a platform where the first bus goes at the front, the second bus goes before that etc, and then everyone can take their choice of bus, and then all of them set off together to the destination.

Of course if you've got all the multiple buses together it might cheaper to have some buses without engines pulled/pushed by buses at the front or back.  I guess you'd have to couple the buses together carefully but that could save energy and maintenance.

Knowing what the fault is I think will help with any actions against the dealer.  For instance if it's a low oil I think it could be reasonably claimed that's something a customer could take care of and maybe not that unexpected if a car has been sitting on a car lot for a while.  It's still a pretty crappy dealer who would not check the oil level prior to selling a car but it's very easy to resolve yourself.

null,false,tone_,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,null,"&gt;I just still don't see how it makes sense to say 'three people babies? But two of the 'parents' would be women!' It's like...I don't see how the phrase 'three parent baby' implies anything about the parents' genders so it calls for any clarification on that point whatsoever.

But I was saying that it is one (**of the numerous**) things that you can't tell from the phrase, and how people may take the term ""three-parent baby"" as a social issue, about three person households and or relationships.

&gt;But two of the 'parents' would be women!

Well you're really trying to sensationalise what I said here. What I said was ""One of the things you can't infer from the name is the fact that two of the ""parents"" must be women. Yet you phrase it as if I'm shocked or appalled. Subtle, but if you have to alter quotations from me in this way to form an argument, then maybe arguing these points against me is pointless.

&gt;so it calls for any clarification on that point whatsoever.

I presume you mean it doesn't imply anything, so it doesn't call for clarification. I really couldn't have been clearer in my initial comment... If you had followed the conversation, instead of jumping in mid point and trying to invent alternative meaning behind my argument so that you can argue against me, you'd have read the original point:

&gt;I hate the phrase 'three-parent babies', I feel it completely misrepresents the science of the procedure and it's effects.

This was the discussion. So I commented, agreeing, and going into small details behind some of the science behind the procedure, and what you **can't** infer from the name alone. You're right in saying that the term doesn't necessarily cause confusion, but it is fairly ambiguous and open to wrong interpretation, and people opposing it for the wrong reasons. I don't see the point in for some reason jumping on my comment, derailing the context and making some unclear argument.

I mean going along with your random train of thought for a minute, why does it matter that I've highlighted certain scientific requirements regarding the process? Literally, as raw as you can, what are you suggesting that I am doing wrong by highlighting that the process requires two female ""parents""?

&gt;It's just the way you said it made it sound like it THAT one point was what was misleading about it. I would say the most misleading thing is the fact that the third parent isn't really even a genetic factor.

I completely disagree and think you're for some reason taking your own misunderstanding as my mistake. The term is ""three-person baby"". Three are required, there's no arguing that. A baby is made, there's no arguing that. ""Person"", well it's not a possible procedure with two men. That's all. I think it's an incredibly obvious and important factor. I can't explain how insane it is that by saying that, people try to fabricate some malice. I mean everything else aside read the comment, infer the tone? Why try to create something out of nothing?

&gt;Besides, it was a simple one sentence question to get clarification on your point. I don't see why you need to accuse me of having an agenda.

My point required no clarification. I don't see how you can claim not to have (for lack of a better word), an ""agenda"" when you see something as trivial, yet factually correct as this, and decide to actually comment. I have no idea what you're actually accusing me of (""bad phrasing"" doesn't count - there has to be some underlying issue). It's also funny that you take offence to the idea of an ""agenda"", when your comment is attempting to suggest I have some ulterior motive or agenda regarding highlighting what I felt an important factor that was directly relevant to the topic.

The key point is this:

It does sometimes feel like it would make sense to just tattoo a barcode on everyone's neck at birth, grab their DNA, biometrics, etc and be done with it.

It would indeed make criminal prosecutions that much easier if you have the entire population in your database to compare fingerprints against.

At the same time. Civil liberties and privacy. It is not unheard of for Police Officers to [abuse their access](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/8713194/Hundreds-of-police-officers-caught-illegally-accessing-criminal-records-computer.html) to [Police databases](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/hundreds-police-sacked-resign-after-3133963) to snoop on neighbours, ex-partners or indeed people they have just met.

Sometimes they are caught, and either given a slap on the wrist or thrown out of the service depending on the severity of the offence. We're not talking about one or two either. We're talking hundreds of officers.

Do we *want* to compile a comprehensive database of everybody? The more data you compile in one place, the more damage it will do if that data is compromised or corrupted.

**For instance...**

A while back it was suggested that holders of Firearm and Shotgun Certificates should have a flag added to their medical records so that doctors would instantly know to talk to the Firearms Licensing Unit if a certificate holder came in with depression or something.

The problem with that - aside from the technical difficulties of keeping it current and accurate over hundreds of thousands of certificate holders - was that via the NHS Spine, individual medical records are available to *millions* of NHS staff, along with anyone (cleaners, maintenance, contractors, etc, etc) who can steal an ID card and get 10 minutes alone in front of a terminal when nurses are out on rounds. Given many of those staff are not vetted to an especially high level it did not - on closer inspection - seem a good idea to give them access to data of whom, and at which addresses firearms and ammunition might be stored at. If that data was compromised (and NHS medical records have been compromised in the past), a criminal would have a hit list of addresses to visit.

That's just one example.

**In Conclusion**

On the face of it, having a database of everyone, and being able to tie them together across many databases is very powerful, and could have enormous benefits for patient healthcare, crime prevention, etc.

However, if that [data](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7449927.stm) [once](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/8826360/History-of-recent-data-blunders-by-government.html) [gets](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/work-and-pensions-secretary-james-purnell-354349) [compromised](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7449255.stm), then the bigger it is the harder it will fall.

I say all this as a Brit, and a Firearm owner who believes firearms licensing is a good thing (to a point), although has certain quibbles over the UK's implementation.

I am on Facebook, and am not a gun-toting ""over my dead body"" redneck prepper who lives off the grid.

I see a place for fingerprint, DNA and photo databases - with proper controls, oversight, and adherence to the DPA (which rules out arbitrarily keeping personal data indefinitely. You can only keep it as long as you can justify it, as confirmed by the courts).

But I also have grave reservations over the idea of simply throwing everyone into a mega database. The idea of ""Big Brother"" is thrown around a lot. But the idea of a mega-database which *could* (even if not legally) be tied into CCTV for face or gait recognition is terrifying. I know a guy who worked on gait recognition software and some of the breakthroughs they have made are genuinely scary. Track everyone everywhere, regardless of clothes, bag, visibility of face.

&gt;__Simo ""Simuna"" Häyhä__ (Finnish pronunciation: [ˈsimɔ ˈhæy̯hæ]; December 17, 1905 – April 1, 2002), nicknamed ""White Death"" ([Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language): Белая смерть, *Belaya Smert*; [Finnish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_language): *valkoinen kuolema*; [Swedish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_language): *den vita döden*) by the [Red Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Army), was a [Finnish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland) [marksman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marksman). Using a Finnish version of the [Mosin–Nagant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosin%E2%80%93Nagant) in the [Winter War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_War), he acquired the highest recorded number in any major war, with at least 505 confirmed sniper kills.

However, slightly oddly, in the second question (which asks basically the same thing but mentions Portugal and effects of decriminalization there), the percentage in favour amongst the higher age groups drops and the 18-24 and 25-34 groups are the most in favour (of decriminalization or trial of decriminalization). It seems on both questions the young are more in favour of decriminalizing, and the old in favour of trialing decriminalization, too. 

edit: Also just to nitpick on a small point - whether the 18-24 group is more or less supportive of decriminalization (or trial thereof) than the 25-34 or 35-44 groups cannot really be deduced from this poll because the percentages are (I think) close enough to be within the margin of error (from the first two questions).

Even if they say no, I doubt anyone there will think you are foolish for asking (and to be brutal will probably have forgotten about you by the end of the week). You have absolutely nothing to lose by exploring the idea.

Have you spoken to your tutor who works at both unis about wanting to move? That would seem the obvious starting point for exploring the idea, and he can probably point you in the right direction for who to talk to if you want to move forward formally.

&gt; Also is it bad to go to the university campus myself, I hate talking over the phone and feel that I can carry myself 100% better when talking in person

That kind of depends on the set-up.  Just rocking up without an appointment is unlikely to go well unless you know they have specific drop-in enquiry facilities.  But I don't think there's anything wrong with finding out who you need to speak to and getting in touch to ask to arrange a meeting (and you may find you can do that via email rather than phone).

All that said, you haven't really said why you want to swap beyond a vague reference to Solent being low ranked.  That's true, but it's no necessarily important.  By the sound of things you're pretty committed to following a path into software development so the overall rating of your uni is much less important than how good its Software Engineering course is and how well that course is perceived within the industry, versus the course you're looking at transferring too.

I don't know about Solent vs Southamption specifically but AIUI at least some of the ""low ranked"" ex-polys are very well regarded in this area, more so than the older, more prestigious universities.

There are even a few who don't even want that but vote SNP.  The big factors are the complete collapse of Labour in Scotland and the collapse generally of the Lib Dems.  The Lib Dem collapse is nationwide, the Labour collapse is I think broadly linked to two factors:

1. Labour are increasingly seen as being corrupt and seem to have an assumption that they will win anyway

2. Labour are not seen to have put as much effort into pushing for the level of devolution people want.

Whether these are good reasons or not is debatable.  The big thing though, is that if devolution had been an option on the referendum it would have got about 70% or so support according to the polls.  That is what MOST people want.  I think that if Labour had strongly and openly backed it then they wouldn't be collapsing as much.  Trouble is that most people in England are very much against it, so, because Labour has to appeal to Scotland and England they can't fully back devolution.

Starvation (either from traps or no longer being able to catch food), poison or death from injury after being shot are the main alternatives, all of which are far worse in terms of suffering. That's not to say that it is right to glorify fox-killing as hunters do, but hunting remains the least bad option in terms of the fox suffering.

There is no moral discrepancy between the desire for animals killed for food to be killed humanely and animals killed for pest-control to be killed humanely. The problem with UKIP is *not* their stance on fox-hunting versus halal slaughter, it is their stance on kosher slaughter (shechita) versus halal slaughter. 

Jews do bring a great deal of benefits to the UK from their cultural and scientific achievements to their financial contributions and success at integration (or at least not causing inter-cultural conflict where they haven't integrated). But their attitudes towards the genital mutilation of children and inhumane slaughter of animals for food should still be condemned.

Is anyone opposed to *therapeutic* surgery? 

The ethical problem is non-therapeutic surgery. National medical organizations stating opposition to non-therapeutic surgery include many in Western Europe as well Australia and New Zealand. 

[Cultural Bias in the AAP’s 2012 Technical Report and Policy Statement on Male Circumcision](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/131/4/796.full), a letter in response to the AAP's task force opinion favoring parental choice over non-therapeutic foreskin destruction of children signed by 38 prominent doctors including many heads of 19 medical associations including pediatric surgeons and pediatric urology in Europe states: 

&gt; Seen from the outside, cultural bias reflecting the normality of ***nontherapeutic*** male circumcision in the United States seems obvious, and the [AAP's 2012] report’s conclusions [claiming ""benefits"" of nontherapeutic foreskin excision justify it being covered by insurance] are different from those reached by physicians in other parts of the Western world, including Europe, Canada, and Australia. In this commentary, a different view is presented by non–US-based physicians and representatives of general medical associations and societies for pediatrics, pediatric surgery, and pediatric urology in Northern Europe. To these authors, only 1 of the arguments put forward by the American Academy of Pediatrics has some theoretical relevance in relation to infant male circumcision; namely, the possible protection against urinary tract infections in infant boys [*of only 0.5%*], which can easily be treated with antibiotics without tissue loss. The other claimed health benefits … are questionable, weak, and likely to have little public health relevance in a Western context, and they do not represent compelling reasons for surgery before boys are old enough to decide for themselves.

&gt; There is growing consensus among physicians, including those in the United States, that physicians should discourage parents from circumcising their healthy infant boys because nontherapeutic circumcision of underage boys in Western societies has no compelling health benefits, causes postoperative pain, can have serious long-term consequences, constitutes a violation of the United Nations’ Declaration of the Rights of the Child, and conflicts with the Hippocratic oath: *primum non nocere*: First, do no harm.",null,0,null,1423051135,null,0,false,0,coati75,null,t3_2um5ej,null,t1_coati75,null,t1_co9z3g6,null,null,null,1424208624,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

What absolute nonsense. At Portsmouth he spent money made available to him by his chairman and won the FA Cup and led them to two successive top ten finishes (they hadn't finished that high in 50 years). Milan Mandaric was responsible for the finances, not the manager.

At Southampton, Rupert Lowe made two terrible appointments in Paul Sturrock and Steve Wigley and the club were heading towards relegation so Redknapp was drafted in to attempt to turn around a woeful team bottom of the league. He was unable to arrest their slump and they went down. No sane person would say Redknapp was responsible for them going down. The damage had been done.

That's really why I went down that route, since the club has made several sounds regarding the transfer policy. We were a good side up until the new league was created. I think we made several signings for the start of the Premiership, also for relatively big money at the time, but they we're deemed to be flops mostly. 

Why is a difficult question to answer. There is a myriad of reasons like how it's only natural that other clubs will rise and former greats will dwindle. A lot of the reasons why we've been mediocre is down to how the club has been run. A prime example of that is during the Hick/Gillette period, a number of false promises, no real intention to develop the club. They wanted to make money. 

If you look at what FSG has done it strikes me that they are trying to push us forward. They have made the expansion of Anfield a reality, they have sorted out our debts and they are looking to develop the club long term with an eye for the future. That has shown in the transfer policy. They're not hiding the fact that they want to make money and selling players we've developed will be a part of that, but at the same time they have on several occasions stated their winning ambitions. Looking at what they did with the Red Sox also suggest that they are people who want their sporting institutions to be winning things. 

Edit: There has also been several outs and ins in the youth set up. Good coaches has come in and a lot of restructuring has taken place at all levels of the club, and that is a key part of the way FSG want to run things. They have always put a lot of emphasis on developing players, and if you want to do that you need the right structure in place. The appointment of Brendan Rodgers is just one of them.

In the UK 109 people died while cycling those 4 billion km, if we had cycle lanes as safe as the Netherlands ones we would expect to see 30 deaths a year. In fact, even that number is misleading as it fails to account for the fact that far more vulnerable members of the population like young children and the elderly cycle in the Netherlands as compared to other countries, people who are far more likely to die if hit by a car as compared to the typical cyclist in the UK.

&gt; The fact is the tangible net benefit from this is going to be hard to demonstrate, as we shall find out. It will be littler more than allowing homoeopathic remedies on the NHS for the gullible.

That's funny because I've never seen homeopathic remedies studied in high profile Journals that conclude that homeopathy works but when it comes to cycling....

Also the prices here are inclusive of ""sales tax"". The price you see is the price you pay at the till. You won't pick up something that is £10 and then pay £12 at the till. 

Queuing. It is in our DNA. Accept it. Likewise not complaining about the service is in our DNA. Tipping is also not compulsory. You do not have to tip. Tip only if you've had good service, not because you feel an obligation. 

Do not attempt to use local dialects, ""British-isms"" and try to pronounce any name ending in ""borough"" like ""Scarborough"" like we do because you usually get it hilariously wrong. We know you're American and you pronounce things ending in ""borough"" as boh-roh and not burrah. Its OK. We're the same with other countries.

Words having different meaning. ""Fanny"" means a womans vagina here. Arse, bum, backside is our equivalent slang for fanny. Obviously that isn't going to go down well in some situations if you say that. A cigarette is commonly called a fag here so if you hear someone say it they're not talking about homosexuals.

They have always put a lot of emphasis on developing players, and if you want to do that you need the right structure in place. The appointment of Brendan Rodgers is just one of them. The sources are hard to find for a guy like me though. Every little detail isn't highly accessible. Alex Inglethorpe is one of the key signings in the Academy setup, he was recently promoted to academy director. 

If you look at what FSG has done it strikes me that they are trying to push us forward. They have made the expansion of Anfield a reality, they have sorted out our debts and they are looking to develop the club long term with an eye for the future. That has shown in the transfer policy. They're not hiding the fact that they want to make money and selling players we've developed will be a part of that, but at the same time they have on several occasions stated their winning ambitions. Looking at what they did with the Red Sox also suggest that they are people who want their sporting institutions to be winning things.

It's just my word since this is an opinion post. I'm just some guy and finding sensitive information about the club and the owners real intention isn't my forte. I can only trust them in what they've done in the past and what they've stated as their intentions. And they look to be going along with those intentions.

This is before laffer curves take effect too, such as the one that resulted in the 50p rate raising less than estimated, because, shock horror, people can't be bothered to work extra.

Before I was a kind of mathematical trader, I would make algos, sometimes 'play' with ANNs (Artificial Neural Nets) that look for arbitrage in certain financial markets.

As a result I'd be frequently working EU to USA hours, this grinds a bit.  Then I became a consultant helping people do and better understand their systems for this.

So odds are I know the language you want.  If it happens to be C# or F#/OCaml, I know it really well, if it happens to be JS I just die inside, maybe cry in a shower after.

I don't have the means to fix it, either as an individual or representing a a group of low-middle earners. I don't have a disposable income like you did, you could afford to pay more and still be better off than me, it's just you don't want to.

&gt; Except they contribute more, more in absolute and more in relative terms.

You didn't read my link then, that shows the poorest 20% pay the most relative to their incomes.

&gt; Actually it would. Have a play with that table I linked you earlier. You can increase the 45p rate 55p and get less money than increasing the 22p to 23p.

Well obviously, increasing the bottom rate of tax would effect many more people. I never said that the tax rates couldn't be raised for  middle earners too, I just pointed out I can't individually fix the problem of the deficit or underfunded welfare state which seemed to be what you were implying. Raising the bottom rate of tax would hit people below the poverty threshold and living wage, but an extra 1-2% on earnings above this *might* be tolerable to most. That's a big might - I don't think it would be possible for someone used to earning over £100k a year to understand how tight the budgets of those on the average wage of £26k are, how a small rise in costs could leave them homeless, how squeezed the middle has become.

&gt; Except they do, they do more than there way, far more, and you are still not happy that it's enough.

Because inequality is now a huge problem in our society, it's been on the rise since 1977, it's not only a problem for the poor it's tearing our society apart and hurting our economy. Wealth redistribution is the only way to fix this, and this means more taxes for the richest.

&gt; thanks TA for paying for all those Nurses that year your attitude is how dare you complain that you had to give up 2/3rds of a chunk of your income

You never gave up 2/3rds of your total income. You paid 20% tax on some of your earnings and 40% on others, the total amount of earnings you lost to taxation would have been less than 40%. 

&gt; You claim to hold moral authority, that if you gave more it would be destitution, yet not so for those richer than you.

Well this is obviously true, the rich paying a higher marginal rate of tax is never going to make them poorer than me, unless the rate went above 100%. So of course the rich/well off can afford to pay more and not lead them to destitution.",null,0,null,1423056435,null,0,1423058631,0,coauwoj,null,t3_2uqri4,null,t1_coauwoj,null,t1_coaug0r,null,null,null,1424207292,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

What the BBC presents as it's ""news"" is so far removed from the reality of what actually goes on and what the government actually does, it's mind boggling. I have over 900 blog articles on the outrageous lies told by the US government over the last few years. Almost all of the Foreign Policy articles (over half) also apply to the UK as well - there are loads of official lies that are dutifully parroted by the media such as the BBC with no questions asked.

Bad management and an attachment to past success. 

We trusted in Souness who wasn't good enough. He destroyed the notion we could compete at the top. We hung on to the bootroom mentality for too long. Didn't move with the times. Evans and Houllier (finally the fresh break) rebuilt a team that won cups, finished 2nd and eventually won a Champions League under Rafa. By that time we weren't stable enough on the financial side to compete with United and Arsenal regularly. Benitez performed miracles with a team unable to attract the really big names and eventually his project petered out.

I'm afraid there isn't much mixing of natives and ex-pats out here. The closest encounters I have with Qataris is on the roads, and it's generally them signalling for me to get out of their way.

This January Qatar have hosted the golf and tennis Masters and also the Handball World Cup. The tennis final didn't fill capacity. The handball final did (although Qatar were in the final having a squad consisting mostly of Europeans. They also brought in Kylie Minogue to perform at the end. I went to previous games, which they couldn't fill despite panic-booking Pharrell Williams and Gwen Stefani to perform post-match). The tennis and the handball were both dry events. Had they allowed alcohol I'm sure the attendances would have been much higher.

The golf is the only event I'm aware of that allows alcohol. It's always brimming with people and a great event for the resident ex-pats.

I can tell you one thing about the World Cup perceptions though... In the UK there is a definite bubble where the media is concerned. Nowhere else is there anything like as much focus on the corruption allegations or infeasibility of having it in Qatar. It's obviously follows from the bitterness of us Brits losing the bid. I get the impression that there's a general sense of optimism about the Qataris hosting the games.

Predictions involving alcohol is difficult. I think there's a trend for things gradually becoming more liberal until a scandal involving some drunk Qatari, and then the authorities crack down on everyone; licenses get revoked, etc.

Saying that, a lot is changing. There might be train links to Dubai, Bahrain etc, which should be cheaper and/or more liberal places to visit. These would only be about an hour away with the high-speed rail being constructed.

I would personally choose Russia for a trip, given the assurance of alcohol, more clement weather conditions and potentially extremely favourable exchange rate.

This is what's amazing, I've had someone tell me I could have bought a flat in zone 2 (fucking bullshit, unless I had a time machine) and all this advice from people saying what effectively amounts to *how easy you had it* yet, one think I know from all the friends I've known who had that sort of income, is that's not true.  Most people I've worked with, in fact bar one, did not come from a wealthy background,  Riches to Rags in three generations and all that does appear quite true in my industry.

I bet if someone looked at your expenses, it would be easier for them to find 1%, than it would for the other person to find 10%.  This is the problem with these very high rate of taxes.

&gt;how a small rise in costs could leave them homeless, how squeezed the middle has become.

This is true for many people who are high earners too.  It's not uncommon for many people my age to be spending huge portion of their income on housing.  I know people earning high salaries that don't have three months of living in savings.  I also know people on £20k who have car loans.  People are fiscally irresponsible, an increase in tax can really create problems for them.

&gt;Wealth redistribution is the only way to fix this, and this means more taxes for the richest.

But we aren't we are taxing income!  That's not going to help when someone can get rich sitting in a flat in London that's now worth 50 times median wage.

&gt; You never gave up 2/3rds of your total income.

Hence why I used the word chunk.

&gt;total amount of earnings you lost to taxation would have been less than 40%

No you are looking at just one kind of tax, there are many NI,CT,CGT etc.

&gt;the rich paying a higher marginal rate of tax is never going to make them poorer than me, unless the rate went above 100%

This is what I find so funny.  An ex's parents sold their flat, which they bought from the council in the 90s.  They sold that for £800k tax free.  They both earn around £20k each, and get tax credits for their still child daughter.  They are richer than me, have more cash than me, and I pay punitive tax compared to them.  Our system is a mess and not remotely fair.

So what is odd, is we have this attitude of *how fucking dare you earn money* in this country, whilst ignoring those who are sitting on piles of it.  Instead we praise the poor people, it's never their own actions to blame, whilst demonising those who try in their life to earn money.  Let's not forget earning money is about creating a supply to some demand.  Satisfying demand is what makes life better.

People get caught up in tails of inequality and the like.  Go look at some of the countries that have better income equality (let's use GINI for sake of argument for what is equality).  Many are shit holes.  What's important is we make our place as good as it can be, not get caught up in some crusade to punish someone who did better than you, who worked harder than you.

My life experiences have given me tremendous respect for some of my friends who can coup with the stress and hassle of their highly paid job, rather than drop down a gear as I chose too.

In the case of the BBC, the BBC is wholly funded by and completely reliant on the British government. This is why the BBC covered up all the evidence that demonstrated Tony Blair's outrageous lies on Saddam, Iraq and the non-existent WMD's. 

The British government and politicians are in turn largely reliant for funding from the big banks, arms companies, large pharmaceutical companies, a few large donor multi millionaires, and some foreign powers such as pro Israeli and Saudi donors.

The Labour Party used to be mostly funded by the Unions but since membership has declined substantially and the Unions are in the Labour Party's pocket anyway, Labour went looking for big business donors - just like the Tories. So we had all of Tony Blair's massive corruption scandals and selling peerages for cash and his soul to JP Morgan's Jamie Dimon, the Neocons, other big banks and various abominable oppressive dictators around the world. (Just in case you are wondering - Ed Miliband is just as distasteful as Tony Blair and David Cameron.)

For the above reasons the BBC also massively lied about Libya and is currently massively lying about Syria, ISIS and Ukraine as well as the drone warfare program, NATO, the financial status of the UK's banks, Pakistan, Egypt, Israel, Saudi Arabia, real unemployment and inflation rates, Mark Carney ...........

null,false,seamushoo4,lfc68,,null,"I think it is fairly obvious that we have improved the club internally. Evidenced by the following:
1. Improved contract structure that rewards performance *see phil coutinho, suarez contract renewals*. Those contract talks are automatically set in place when players reach specific goals set out by the executive team. In addition, players who we sign are making good money but not these mega contracts until they prove they're worth their weight. It is part of the reason why it's been harder to sign players, recently, but when the team is performing better (and consistently) this becomes a very attractive place to come because your performance bonuses are very likely to kick in. 

2. We have a management team that is willing to spend big bucks. We have spent something close to the quarter of a billion mark on players since FSG came in, albeit recklessly in some cases, but this most recent window and the sturridge/coutinho window show that they are in the market for good bargains and are recruiting well. I think this window, in a years time, will go down as one of our best in the last 15 years. With time, can, marko, moreno will almost certainly come good, balotelli still has world class potential, lambert was a bargain for a good back up, origi has world class potential is in my mind a top 10 attacking talent in the world in 2 years. lovren and lallana are both players who were supposed to slot in straight away have had an unexpected adjustment period. Lallana is starting to show form and is certainly the best player we bought this window, not including potential best buys. He is the polished article and is now just in need of a run of form. Lovren i still believe has it in him to be a great defender for us for the next 5-10 years. 

all in all, that is further proof internally the club is growing. the transfer committee is shady at best, and i know nothing about them so i cannot speak to that very much, but I beleive there is movement on that front. [This!](http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11669/9608922/transfer-news-liverpool-to-undergo-complete-review-of-player-recruitment-strategy) is the best I can find through a quick google search on that front.

3. Club revenues, stadium renovation and the commercial side of LFC has started to kick into gear. This is evidenced, obviously, by our movement on building a new stadium (with no interest, may i add, meaning we can realistically pay this off int he 5 year time frame they mentioned). This will put us with england's elite for stadia. 

Our commercial sponsors that we acquired in the last few years included vauxhall, garuda indonesia, dunkin donuts, subway, standard charter, warrior...those sponsorships are certainly going to increase after this season, and we will likely have an increased shirt sponsor deal, will have a bidding war after the warrior/new balance agreement ends and will sell naming rights to the main stand. 

commercial revenues have literally increased 100% in the last 10 years. [I know this is Wikipedia, but it looks like they have pulled our data from the last few years of the deloitte money league!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deloitte_Football_Money_League#2013.E2.80.9314)

Anyways this is a bit of a rant and I do not have time to put together something more cogent, but this hopefully is a good start. Why does he beleive we'll be challenging for titles within 5 years? I know that I fully expect us to be challenging for titles from here on out. Our squad, minus gerrard, jones, kolo and glenjo (and I think at least 2 of those 4 will be gone, i know all 4 are out of ) makes us the youngest squad in the league. Almost all of our core group of ""young"" players are contracted until 2018 at least, this includes sturridge, coutinho, sterling (soon to be 2020), ibe (contracted until 2018, will be renewed), moreno (2019), can (2019), marko (2019), hendo (im not worried about him leaving), sahko (2018), lovren (2019), flanno (when he comes back will sign better deal)...that's a really strong core of ""young players"" who if we want to flex muscle a la suarez, cannot leave us. We have a bright, young manager who is here for a few more years by contract. He has steadied the ship and is building a foundation that is stronger without suarez. we are 5 points off 3rd, and were missing our best player for 5 months in a stretch where our biggest weakness was putting chances away and controlling the midfield. This is why I believe we will be challenging for titles, and if fsg continue to put 30-50m a summer into a couple key positions, we will continue to build on this model. Football isn't like baseball (with salary caps) where they will need to blow the team up after they win titles, either. Very different mindset with football and baseball.

for context:

I am on a 4 year course currently but will probably complete 3 years under the student loans company. The 3/4 year variable makes a considerable difference to how you deal with the loan 

I borrow the maximum tuition loan £9,000 and I think approx £4,000 in maintenance?

I am 20 years old

-------------------

After creating a comprehensive spreadsheet projecting my future earnings I have concluded with a high level of certainty that it is not appropriate, in my case, to pay back the loan early. I consider this to be the correct course of action for most people in a similar position to myself. 

The only circumstances under which it would be better to pay back early is if:

You expect to earn quite a lot of money immediately after graduation (40-50k)

You expect your salary to increase rapidly to high levels 

or

You only borrow a small amount i.e. not the full loans available from SLC. Say for instance you only took out a maintenance loan and had your tuition covered by scholarship/benefactor/parents.
 

I won't post my spreadsheet as it is pretty messy and makes some very general assumptions. But I will give you a flavour. 

In the industry I want to work in I am predicting £25,000 starting rising to £32,000 within the year, £46,000 at 6 years after graduation with healthy increases of about 1k/yr thereafter (I actually have a very accurate idea of what I will be earning, but this likely is not the case for most). I have considered inflation and assumed that the loan continues to track at 5.5%. Do not gloss over the fact that this is a variable rate linked to the retail price index (RPI+3%) and could get very scary indeed. I consider it very unlikely to happen but please bare in mind that in 1975 the retail price index was 24.9% which would leave your annual interest rate at an eye watering 27.9%!! (low cost student loans eh?) But this is not actually as scary as it sounds, no matter the interest rate your 9% (above 21) will remain fixed. This means that if you do not aggressively pay down the 'loan' you do not adopt any further risk no matter if the retail price index is 1% or 50%

My calculations suggest loan principle will increase up to a maximum just shy of £70,000 around 15 years after graduation before decreasing down to approx £40,000 at the 30 year write off point 

--------
Now it is pretty scary to be sitting with a £50,000 plus loan that could not exactly be described as cheap for the next 30 odd years but I believe in cold hard numbers and that helps me offset the fear of this massive scary 'loan'. As such I do not intend to pay back more than the 9%. My circumstances are subject to change as in the future I could potentially be a high earner and that would require me to re-evaluate the situation.

Things will be different for you and as such I urge you to do your own research. I am no authority on this and these are just my basic calculations but if you have any questions I can endeavour to answer them.

Well done for being a step ahead of the game. When I ask my buddies about their student loans they don't have a sodding clue. I would say most students couldn't tell you the payback thresholds, perhaps 1 in 10 could tell you the interest rate and to find people like me doing payback optimisation calculations are very rare. Most young people lack the foresight to consider the serious financial implications.

TL;DR: Depends on your individual circumstances. I personally chose to view it as an education tax for the next 30 years and have concluded that for myself (and most people) paying it back is unnecessary and could be more expensive.

null,false,MaesterWeasel,null,null,null,"**General changes:**

We shouldn't change our working system. Only if it doesn't work any more (players available don't fit or are out of form) we should try something else. 

We could also have some very in-form players on the bench because they won't fit the formation and then try to fit them in by tweaking the system a bit. I'm talking about someone like Balotelli. Hypothetically, if he starts firing on all cylinders suddenly, we should have him up front with Sturridge. 

**Defending:**

At the moment we play something in the middle of zonal and man-to-man defence, right? I think it has worked alright and should just try to improve it. It's not good, but it's better what we had at the start of the season.

**Backline:**

Three at the back seems to suit well for Skrtel and Sakho. Can is suitable for every position, I imagine. Skrtel likes to be in center of everything, but he doesn't like defending pacy attacks. Sakho has looked less comfortable in a 2 CB formation. He was bad at LB, but he is great at being something in the middle of those two. 

Markovic also reaps rewards from that backline. When he's under the striker, he doesn't have that much space to run into, it's too congested for him. Wingback position utilizes his workrate and the speed that he can travel with ball. Eventually I'd see him at either side on the wing. Moreno is in similar position - he didn't look comfortable with the LB position but looks at home in wingback's role.

**Changes:**

I don't really think there will be much changes in this season. Maybe we'll change to 4-3-3 in some games at certain times, not out of the question. Ibe doesn't really have a position as of yet. I'm not so sure he fits in the middle well.",null,0,null,1423061400,null,0,1423067717,0,coawv1z,null,t3_2ur5bx,null,t1_coawv1z,null,t3_2ur5bx,null,null,null,1424202003,null,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3,null

So obvious answer is it's all an illuminate plot.  Better one, in my industry it's more a case of lack of supply, and scaling of resource issues.  If your job is a simple one, that requires no communication, it's very easy to parallelise (ie hire more people).  If it's one which has very complex thought communication requirements, it's incredibly hard.

null,false,Nice-MayMay,null,null,null,"I'll tell you about my advisor I have at the moment. On Universal Credit, you get a normal weekly signing and a ""work coach"". 

The first day I went to sign on, the work coach cajoled me into committing to a job interview that wasn't even of interest to me, at all. The job description was so vague that nobody should be made to commit to it. No work hours listed or pay, no information of travel costs or board (it was working away) etc. 

I was booked for the interview and it was on my mind for a good week  just what exactly I was going to say in the interview — since I'd had no experience in the work area — and I had no interest in it. Fortunately, I'd received notification that I'd been accepted for a second interview for the same day as the one booked for me previously. So I documented that fact on the Jobsmatch website.

I went to my weekly signing and my advisor told me that since the first interview was booked by the Job Centre, I would need proof that I was attending the other interview in its place. Anyway, I ended up receiving a call from this new interview employer to change the interview time on a Friday. I asked if i could have an email sent to me — confirming my attendance on the Monday — so I could show that to the Job Centre.

I attended the interview on the Monday after not receiving any email over the weekend — so I made a mental note of asking for it again — since i needed that to show to the Job Centre. The interview was good and I asked the manager for the email again. He didn't seem too pleased, as other people going for the job had asked for the same thing. He said he'd send it anyway, but again, I received no email. I documented all this, including the phone number that called me, the two phone records on my phone (time and date) and the managers name.

My advisor was happy that the phone records, the managers name and the extensive notes I'd made was good enough proof.

So after all that, I've seen my work coach this week again. She doesn't seem to care about all the effort I've made, the other three interviews I've had in the space of two weeks — or the large amount of jobs I'm applying for every week. She practically blackmailed me on Monday to commit to a two week course with a ""guaranteed interview"" at the end of it. I tried to respectfully decline to commit — since the job was not for me — and the course wasn't either. She said, and i quote: ""but I want you to do it"". That to me was a thinly veiled threat, since she has nothing personally investment in me.

So now I'm booked on a course that is below my skill set, the job that could possibly come at the end of it is of no interest to me and I will have to pay for two weeks travel to it. She is all smiles but she's also a manipulative and scary women. I would really like to avoid this course because the time there could be spent looking for work myself. 

Does anyone know the actual legality of Job Centre staff making you commit to things like that? I'm not talking about guidelines, but the actual law.

Basically, in all of the cells in your body, there is a full set of DNA made up partly from your mother, and partly from your father. This is located in the nucleus, and determines how you look, acts, contains instructions for cell activities and reproduction (mitosis), etc. In addition to this, there are little structures called mitochondria in your cells which convert food (glucose) into a more usable form of energy (ATP). These mitochondria contain an entirely separate set of DNA that only comes from the mother (it came the egg, not the sperm).*

In some people, the mitochondrial DNA in their eggs is mutated, so although they themselves are healthy, any children they have will not be. To combat this, doctors can remove the nucleus -- the part containing the externally visible, really important DNA -- from the egg with the spoiled mitochondria and place it in a donor egg that has properly functioning mitochondria (and has had its original nucleus removed and discarded). This egg is then mated with a sperm from the father through IVF, and then re-implanted into the womb of the mother.

Note that no where is actual DNA modified.

Lucas and Henderson are the obvious candidates. They were absolutely crucified in their first couple of seasons and both went on to be key players (Lucas was world class before his injury and dominated a Yaya Toure inspired Man City midfield just before being felled).

Are you really arguing that good players only come from good teams? Would Lallana be any less of a good signing had we bought him two years ago when Southampton were in the Championship? Was John Barnes a crap signing because we bought him from bottom of the table Watford?

And since when was Ings the signing that was going to make us title contenders? As I have said three times and will now repeat for the fourth time: He is a low cost low risk signing with potential to be a great player for us.

Man City signed Adam Johnson from the championship a season or two ago. Did that make them any less title contenders? He may not have worked out for them, but they still won the damn title that year.

Why is this signing such a big deal? I really don't understand. At worst we get a squad player (like Borini) for basically nothing, who is younger, English, adapted to the league and the lynchpin of a Premier League side. If he fails, so what? We move on like we have with Aspas, Carroll, and (probably) Lambert before him.

But he will cost less than any of those and will be sold for a profit if he does fail. I still do not understand what the problem is.

&gt;Person after person said that they knew about CSE but not the ‘scale and the scope’, and questioned the numbers of victims in Professor Jay’s report. Professor Jay estimated that there were at least 1400 victims of CSE between 1997 and 2013. She states this was a conservative estimate. It was this figure that received most condemnation by Rotherham Council. 


&gt;If the 1400 figure is broken down to an annual average over the period Professor Jay looked into, it comes to just under 85 children a year. Although Professor Jay did not derive her estimate from Council records as she found them too unreliable (as did we), these figures should not come as a surprise to Members or senior officers in Rotherham. In 2013-14, Rotherham’s published CSE cases totalled 107, a similar figure to the average Professor Jay calculates over 16 years. When put like that, some officers suggested 1400 was definitely an underestimate. It does not take much to put the figure in perspective in this way. But few had. This is because refuting the numbers of children affected is not really about the numbers. It is about denial of the problem. 


&gt;Inspectors were told that the numbers were an extrapolation, that they had been generated by a computer programme, and that the 1400 must have referred to the number of ‘contacts’ (that is, the number of people getting intouch with the Council about CSE) rather than peopleactually experiencing it. 


&gt;“1400 is a figure not known to anybody.”- A Councillor

&gt;“I struggle to accept the number, but I’m not a mathematician.”- A Councillor

&gt;“I certainly didn’t know what scale [CSE] was.”- A Councillor

&gt;“[is] the 1400 figure based on real girls or an estimate?”- A senior politician

&gt;“We keep saying 1400 victims. But where are they?”- A Councillor

&gt;“She [Professor Jay] was wrong about us kn owing about [victims of CSE], and wrong about the numbers. I don’t know where the 1400 number came from.”- A Councillor

&gt;“I thought it was probably the worst report I had read in my life. It was full of innuendo, supposition, it made statements not based on evidence; it just didn’t make sense.”- A former Councillor

&gt;“I do wonder where some of the facts and figures in the Jay report came from. There were people that should have been spoken to and weren’t... I don’t feel like I’ve seen anything that showed where that 1400 figure had come from.”- A Councillor

&gt;“The 1400 figure never came to me. The Heal report discussed 50-60, a small percentage of which were CSE.”- A Councillor

&gt;“[I] feel very angry, [the report is] not accurate, balanced... some parts I don’t accept.”- A senior officer

&gt;“...the Social Care team didn’t recognise the 1400 number...The number of people who were victims or at real risk of CSE was much lower than was being portrayed.”- An officer

&gt;“Only in 2011 did I become aware of CSE as an activity, not even as an issue... the scale has come as a big surprise to me. The figures seem disproportionate with any other town that is actively looking for CSE.”- A former senior officer

&gt;We have concluded that the 1400 figure is a conservative one and that RMBC and South Yorkshire Police (where some also dispute the figures) would do better to concentrate on taking effective action rather than seeking to continue a debate about the numbers.

See their Schurrle (whom I think is actually a 9/10 or 10/10 but not for their squad and system) for Cuadrado move as one example of this, or Madrid moving Ozil (9/10) on to add Bale (10/10).

With EriKane, there are certainly better players at their position. Perhaps not many, but they exist. As such, there are 10 positions in our starting XI that can be improved (Hugo is basically the best at his position). With Bale, we've got two of 11 spots maximized, and it's a lot easier to find an 8/10 or 7/10 you think will be an 8 or 9 than it is to sign a 10/10.",null,0,null,1423062632,null,0,false,0,coaxgs5,null,t3_2uqq2u,null,t1_coaxgs5,null,t3_2uqq2u,null,null,null,1424201426,null,17,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,17,null

I go to a few good groups with local businesses where we meet and have breakfast and try to sell our businesses. More importantly to me is the support network that it has given me. I have really crappy weeks where its freezing cold and the only enquiries are from people who don't have a clue how much catering costs in the real world (I get at least two calls a month for people wanting a sit down wedding lunch for £10ph), and I go there and realise I'm in the same boat as everyone else.

I'm not looking forward to the usual suspects siezing on the ""political correctness"" aspect and ignoring the rest of the report marking the wholly uncooperative nature of the South Yorks Police or the council itself.

Its probably incredibly telling that Shawn Wright's name keeps cropping up in both this and the original Jay Report as being uncooperative.

EDIT:

Now that I've had time to read the entire thing, I'm pretty certain that the council was essentially offered a chance to resign instead of being fired with immediate effect - or alternatively being turned into a smoking glass crater.

It is incredibly damning at all levels, from bad management, light touch (aka nonexistent) punishment, lack of oversight, lack of follow ups, lack of investigation, concern about the councils image, fraud over losses of sensitive information, callous attitude by the Police, dismissive attitudes to the youth workers actually working with victims because they werent actually part of the council, fear over rocking the boat, a complete denial of the reality of CSE at hand at every level, possible corruption on the part of at least one councillor and horrifically poor oversight on the part of the taxi licensing authority.

Even better, the report makes a particular note of that sensitive information theft of having no signs of a break in- so possibly an inside job, of police treating the victims as willing participants despite fulfilling the criteria of statutory rape and, incredibly, the use of Abduction notices overriding any actual progress on an issue.

The police evidently knew that these people were taking children, otherwise there wouldnt have been anything like as many abuction notices being served. They then resolutely failed to follow up on these people being served AN's.

This report and its predecessor, the Jay Report, is definitely worth reading from start to finish even if it does take you a couple of hours. The bullshit being slung by the right about this being a race issue is only a tiny part of the terrifyingly incompetent and malicious whole - reading this makes me sad that there isnt an equivalent of an Inquisition to immediately take control of Rotherham as the incumbent council is manifestly incompetent, corrupt and possibly colluding with the abusers.",null,0,null,1423062917,null,0,1423071397,0,coaxm6u,null,t3_2ur1nm,null,t1_coaxm6u,null,t3_2ur1nm,null,null,null,1424201284,null,6,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,6,null

The BBC (since Tony Blair &amp; his Iraq WMD's) has been exactly on a par with Stalin's Pravda or Goebbel's Ministry of Truth. Fox News, CNN, New York Times etc. are the same in the US. Australia and Canada are no better. Murdoch owns Sky News, the Times and the Sun in the UK. He owns Fox in the US and half of Australian media. Go find me a piece where Sky News disagreed with the BBC about some significant Foreign Policy issue. The BBC is now so bad, that Murdoch might as well be running it - it wouldn't tell any more lies or less of the truth than it already does.

The above are ALL Corporate and State sponsored propaganda outlets - and none of them tell you the truth about anything of any significance. Their main purpose is to keep the general public misinformed about what is actually going on so that big business can continue to make big bucks at the expense of the taxpayer and the middle class.

Did the BBC (or the US) tell you about King Abdullah being the largest funder of Islamic Terrorist groups in the world? No they did not.

The BBC constantly lies about just about everything. I have over 900 articles documenting the lies of the US government over the last 15 years - at least half of them also apply to the British government - but neither the US media nor the BBC will tell you any of them.

Obama visited Riyadh paying tribute to the largest funders of Islamic Extremist Terrorism in the world http://ian56.blogspot.com/2015/01/the-leaders-of-west-went-to-pay-tribute.html

Sturridge is already 25 but he is already world class. Lucas *is* a world class defensive midfielder. It's one of the most difficult positions to fill in a football side and there aren't too many better than Lucas at it. 

Coutinho and Sterling are on the verge. Henderson is almost there too.

Potential wise:

 - Markovic hasn't convinced me. He's shown brief flashes but is very inconsistent. He's young though and has raw talent so... maybe. 
 - Ibe is one of the most exciting young talents we have. Quick, strong, skillful, good finisher, can go around players with ease. Needs to improve his awareness but is an awesome prospect.
 - Moreno, already 22, very quick, powerful shot. Shocking lapses in concentration when defending. Has time on his hands though.
 - Can is another exciting prospect. Very strong, quick, very good passer. I can see him being a big player for us, probably in a central midfield position. 

That's just the players in our senior side. I really don't know enough about our youth team players to judge their potential. It really is a lottery as to who makes it and who doesn't.

&amp;nbsp;

1) Take Sturridge off at 70' if needed. This is immense if we're winning, need DS for a game 3 days later, and don't want to change the complexion of the game (using Lambert/Balo would do that). This is also good if we're dominating but still 0-0... we need fresh legs but don't necessarily want to move to a plan B.

&amp;nbsp;

2) Let Sterling play out wide where he's incredibly potent the whole game, and take him off for someone else if needed. The trickle down effect is that you could have one of Coutinho or Lallana in the #10 spot where they are probably at their best too. Right now they play somewhat like narrow wingers. I'll admit that this is mostly a DS is back item rather than an Ings item, but subbing DS for Ings would allow these other players to stay in those positions after the substitution. 

&amp;nbsp;

3) Play a coherent diamond with both strikers pressing hard and making runs, as opposed to one hold-up, one runner. One of the most key things I noticed when DS came on at the weekend was that **we went on the break with pace again**. This is not suited to our other strikers. If anyone can, it's Borini, but while his positioning and quickness/sharpness is there, he's not one to break for 50 yards on a counter.

If I had the energy there is a new and potentially extremely lucrative avenue which I could take the business down. The CAD commission work pays *extremely* well and I'm damn good at it, and for about 18 months up to may last year I was making crazy money on about 120 hours per month (at least by my standards.)

Thing is, I bought a really great new CAD suite in november that's industry standard but haven't had the breathing room to learn it yet on top of everything else. If I can hammer that for a few weeks then I can actually feel comfortable setting up a legit design consultancy business and network at trade shows etc. ""Oh you need a toothbrush pattern?

&gt;

&gt;___Hocus Pocus___ is a 1993 American [horror comedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_comedy) film directed by [Kenny Ortega](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Ortega) and starring [Bette Midler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bette_Midler), [Sarah Jessica Parker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Jessica_Parker), and [Kathy Najimy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathy_Najimy) as a trio of [witches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch), the Sanderson Sisters, who are inadvertently resurrected by a cynical teenager, his younger sister, and his crush in the small town of Salem, Massachusetts.

&gt;Despite receiving negative reviews from critics during its theatrical release, the film proved popular enough to gain a [cult following](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_film) on home video and remains a firm [Halloween](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween) favorite.

Now for all you candidates out there, remember to dress appropriately for your interview and ASK QUESTIONS! It is important to convey your interest in the position you have applied for and show that you have done your research. You can do this for example by looking through the dotabuff's posted and asking: I've noticed Obito has 2 pages of low priority games played most recently, is he always a toxic individual or is he just misunderstood?

Good luck boys (and girls!), don't be afraid to ask me for more tips! :)

Some things are very expensive here, we know already, it won't win you any friends by telling us we're ripped off by taxes and import duty. Some things are really cheap though, when you find them you will marvel at how fortunate we are.

We do not all have teeth like Nigel Farage, that is a myth perpetuated by your media and (probably) dentist lobby groups. We have normal teeth, they work fine and don't blind people when we speak, and cost less to maintain.

If someone calls you 'mate' they might be about to cheerily slap you on the back and buy you a pint, or about to headbutt you. It's all in the eyes. Also, we headbutt things, we do not as a rule have firearms so are forced to attack things we don't like with our own foreheads, it's just another regional quirk we have.

Nobody really gives a fuck about much, we moan a lot but ultimately we are a benign lot. Nobody will blame you personally for George W Bush, or any of the other nonsense you've done of late, so there is no need to pretend you're Canadian here.

We have Muslims, possibly more in one place than you're used to. There really is nothing to fear though, no matter what FOX News pundits may say, the naughty ones are all in Syria being naughty.

We use the metric system (mostly), it's easier as we divide things by ten rather than by cups or whatever the fuck. Your money is metric (cent is 100th - same as percent or century) so if you get stuck just use that same math.

We say maths.

Last season we had Suarez and Sturridge. The two best strikers in the league. Now Sturridge is great, don't get me wrong, but he was our number 2 compared to Suarez. We sold Suarez and replaced him with who? Rickie Lambert and Balotelli. Let that sink in for a moment. Liverpool is a club that has had 2 world class strikers at all times. It's not that big of a coincidence that when we finally get two (like we used to always have) we almost won the fucking league. Just look at our history and you can see for yourself what happens when we only have one (who is also injury prone). 


So if we buy Ings, that will give us: Ings, Origi, Borini, Aspas, Lambert, and Balotelli. Yeah, Origi is 19 and could be really good but do any of these people fill you with confidence? Now it's all well and good to buy young talent with potential, but when that's all you buy you've got a big problem when it doesn't pan out. For once we need to buy a proven goal scorer to partner Sturridge or at the very least be able to play on his own and score when Sturridge is injured.

Now before anyone says ""but but we took at shot with Sturridge when he only had potential!"" yeah well let's compare those two. I didn't want Sturridge at first (I'll hold my hand up and admit it), but he at least came from Man City, and then from Chelsea. He was moving around from big clubs at an early age so something was there.  Ings has around 7 call ups to U21 for England, and joined Burnley when they were in the championship a few years ago. Hardly filling me with confidence. 


So all in all, no I don't see Ings as a step up. If anything it's a lateral move.",null,0,null,1423064757,null,0,1423064947,0,coaylow,null,t3_2uqeat,null,t1_coaylow,null,t3_2uqeat,null,null,null,1424200344,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

Statistically he's just simply gotten things done. I think he's unfortunate to not have about 6-8 more points from his career so far as well. However the biggest positive for me is the atmosphere. Outside of Gomis, we seem to have a tightly knit squad. Laudrup's team always felt talented, but you could tell where the social faultlines were. Inevitably when we were down on our luck the locker room simply imploded. 

As far as signings go Siggy, Montero, Fabianski, Barrow, Cork, Naughton, Gomis, Emnes and Tiendelli is a mixed lot, but outside of Tiendelli there is heaps of quality in those signings. Best set of players I can think of. Additionally, getting rid of Pablo and Chico for the price we got was astoundingly good business in my mind. A+ in the market from me. 

Finally, as for Gomis and the tactic controversies I can't hold either against him too much. Gomis is a fucking cunt with a cunty agent and they go off cunting together every chance they get. No one predicted that, but it is what it is. And the tactical changes have been fantastic in my opinion. Look at our defensive record! Our GD is completely askew from getting smashed by Liverpool and Chelsea, but we have the 3rd most clean sheets in the league. I love our structure at the back and it is our strongest asset this year.

Where Monk blows away the contenders in my opinion is the fact that this is one of our own. We discovered him. He isnt some hotshot looking to advance his career, he is supporter of the club looking to push his own club to its limits. Sorry for the novel, but in short, I think Monk was a fantastic/lucky signing for us and I am thoroughly pleased by his work so far.

FSG are unwilling to do this and the debt on the club keeps rising. I'm sure the long term plan is that the club is self sufficient and over time these loans are paid back but it is going to be a long hard process to make us competitive on a consistent basis in regards of winning major trophies.

&gt;

&gt;In the 14th century, the English cleric and historian [Walter Hemingford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Hemingford) described the location of the Scottish coronation stone as the [monastery of Scone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scone_Abbey), a few miles north of Perth:

&gt;*Apud Monasterium de Scone positus est lapis pergrandis in ecclesia Dei, juxta manum altare, concavus quidem ad modum rotundae cathedreaie confectus, in quo futuri reges loco quasi coronationis ponebantur ex more.*

&gt;In the monastery of Scone, in the church of God, near to the high altar, is kept a large stone, hollowed out as a round chair, on which their kings were placed for their ordination, according to custom.

&gt;Various theories and legends exist about the Stone's history prior to its placement in Scone:

&gt;


&gt;* One story concerns [Fergus, son of Erc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fergus_I), the first King of the Scots in Scotland, whose transportation of the Stone from Ireland to Argyll, where he was crowned in it, was recorded. 


&gt;


&gt;* Some versions identify the stone brought by Fergus with the [Lia Fáil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lia_F%C3%A1il) used at [Tara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tara,_County_Meath) for the [High King of Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_King_of_Ireland). Other traditions contend the Lia Fáil remains at Tara.   (Inis Fáil, The Island of Destiny, is one of the traditional names of Ireland.)

&gt;* Legends place the origins of the Stone in [Biblical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible) times and consider the Stone to be the [Stone of Jacob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_of_Jacob), taken by [Jacob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob) while in [Haran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haran_(biblical_place\)).  (Genesis 28:10-22). 

&gt;* According to [Hector Boece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hector_Boece), the stone was first kept in the [lost city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_city) of [Evonium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evonium), in the west of Scotland. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*]

&gt;Geologists proved that the Stone taken by [Edward I of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_I_of_England) to Westminster  is a ""lower [Old Red Sandstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Red_Sandstone)"", which was quarried in the vicinity of Scone.  Doubts over the authenticity of the Stone have existed for a long time: a [blog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog) post by retired Scottish academic and writer of historical fiction Marie MacPherson shows that they date back at least two hundred years. 

&gt;A letter to the editor of the *Morning Chronicle*, dated 2 January 1819, states:

&gt;&gt;


&gt;On the 19th of November, as the servants belonging to the West Mains of Dunsinane-house, were employed in carrying away stones from the excavation made among the ruins that point out the site of Macbeth's castle here, part of the ground they stood on suddenly gave way, and sank down about six feet, discovering a regularly built vault, about six feet long and four wide. None of the men being injured, curiosity induced them to clear out the subterranean recess, when they discovered among the ruins a large stone, weighing about 500l [230 kg]. which is pronounced to be of the meteoric or semi-metallic kind. This stone must have lain here during the long series of ages since Macbeth's reign. Besides it were also found two round tablets, of a composition resembling bronze. On one of these two lines are engraved, which a gentleman has thus deciphered.— 'The sconce (or shadow) of kingdom come, until Sylphs in air carry me again to Bethel.' These plates exhibit the figures of targets for the arms. From time immemorial it has been believed among us here, that unseen hands brought Jacob's pillow from Bethel and dropped it on the site where the palace of Scoon now stands. A strong belief is also entertained by many in this part of the country that it was only a representation of this Jacob's pillow that Edward sent to Westminster, the sacred stone not having been found by him. The curious here, aware of such traditions, and who have viewed these venerable remains of antiquity, agree that Macbeth may, or rather must, have deposited the stone in question at the bottom of his Castle, on the hill of Dunsinane (from the trouble of the times), where it has been found by the workmen. This curious stone has been shipped for London for the inspection of the scientific amateur, in order to discover its real quality.

Bearing in mind that I'm relatively new to following the sport, and am probably missing perspective on both Balotelli's skill set and what role a striker should provide, I had the following thought after watching this clip:

Recently, Sterling was moved (further) forward to bolster our striking threat, and it seems to be working. While Balotelli hasn't been scoring, it looks like he's doing at least a decent job moving the ball around, tracking back, and trying to set up chances to score. With that said, I wonder whether it would be worthwhile for him to simply drop into an attacking midfield role; leave Sterling up front, and let him focus more on supporting. Especially now that we're using a 3-4-3/3-4-2-1, Sturridge and Ibe are back on the roster, and we have Origi on the way in the summer, do we need a little more depth in the midfield, and a little less with our strikers? Could Balotelli fill that role?

TL;DR -- Instead of letting Balo spin his wheels up front, why not switch him and Sterling?",null,0,null,1423066699,null,0,false,0,coazp3d,null,t3_2uo632,null,t1_coazp3d,null,t3_2uo632,null,null,null,1424199249,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

While this is mostly correct, there's a couple of caveats one should be aware of.

* The limit doesn't apply at all if there was a CCJ issued against you regarding the debt.

* If at any time in the last 6 years you have acknowledged the debt then the limit does not apply.

This condition isn't particularly difficult to pick up after closer assessment after an abnormal ECG (ultrasound and MRI should have been done), so they should have done better. 

I'm sorry to hear about your friend though. The problem there is he probably didn't have an ECG done at any point, and just had a standard physical done. The most investigative thing they do for those physicals (as you may know yourself) is to just listen for murmurs, which aren't always apparent with this condition.

I don't think most people are part of the problem on a global level. It depends on how you would define being part of the problem, but on an international scale levels of inequality have been falling, despite the fact that the worlds most successful economies operate by exploiting the worlds poorest people.

It's only natural for people to worry more about the issues they face in their own society than globally as the average person barely feels engaged in their own political system, I wouldn't expect them to take responsibility for the fact that they may be part of a global political system where the outcome of their day to day existence might be exploiting people and keeping them in poverty.

It's the increasing inequality within society which creates this 'us and them' mentality which causes people to think that maybe 'they' should be doing more for 'us', even though there is no real distinct line that can be drawn between 'us' and them.

Suicide is pretty much always an over-reaction, but I know people who were in dire straits and an unexpected financial burden of a lot less than £800 to push them to suicide.

It's not just education, you have to just bear in mind that not everybody has the same personality type.

There are plenty of shy, meek people who are educated enough to know they are being fucked over, but not strong enough to stand up for themselves, or too cowed by authority to stand up for themselves, or too fearful about their living situation to stand up for themselves.. We need to introduce laws to stop people like that getting fucked over.

People like you and me can stand up for ourselves - but, and I am assuming on your part, we can afford to. If my landlord would have kicked me out or made it impossible for me to stay, I had enough money in savings for a deposit and 6 weeks up front. Many people do not.

Honestly, this sort of post just misses the point completely. ""People should be more like me"" - well they aren't! That's precisely why we are talking about needing new laws.

One person there had nothing to do but give away bus tickets for interviews, and ideally find a reason not to. Nothing else, just waiting if anyone will show up and ask for a one day bus pass. Most of the time there was nobody there, so he was on, presumably, his own laptop watching movies. He wasn't even hiding it.

Second person was my adviser, who barely spoke English, and her solution to everything was ""just go out there and start working"". I actually knew more about employment law than her, and had to show her what she was clicking wrong in their own IT system that she was clearly not trained in.

The third person was just someone who was taking those green slips with sign on dates from people, and she had to sort them in three boxes. One was ""18-24 years"", one was ""adults"" and one was ""DEA (Disability Employment Advisor)"". That's all she ever did while I was there.

They never wrote back to me, even though I was genuinely serious. I would be better, more efficient, can speak two more European languages, and I would actually be there to help people, unlike them. I didn't hope to get the job, it was more of a rant towards them. But I did expect a reply.

Next time when I went there I was greeted by one of the, I presume, bosses of the place, who told me that my slander of their staff is not acceptable, and this time he'll let me go with a warning, but if I do anything else wrong, there will be serious consequences.

The irony of it all was that I also put this ""DWP job application""  in the job application review that they have to check every time I sign in.

45% + NI is actually quite a lot for someone to pay. There is a point where raising tax too high reduces how much you earn as those people shuttle off elsewhere. 

Taxation hasn't actually decreased really, apart from that 6 months when it was at 50%, what's changed is spending priorities with less on being spent on welfare. This is compounded by a higher cost of living as well as a general reduction in incomes in recent years. We need to address those issues rather than just telling people to 'pay fucking more'.

Did these BBC reports go out on the 6 o'clock or 10 o'clock TV news or were they only published on the BBC's website? I note that a massive lie by the Deputy Israeli foreign minister Danny Ayalon is included in the report. Over 2,000 civilians and over 500 children were very deliberately targeted and murdered by the Israeli government. Around 4 Israeli civilians were killed along with 60+ Israeli soldiers participating in the attack on Gaza. Did a representative of the protest get to appear on the 6 o'clock News with at least equal airtime to a pro Israeli spokesperson?

I bet the BBC didn't go into these:-

Wut?

Are you suggesting that bicycles are what's slowing drivers down?

http://www.tfl.gov.uk/cdn/static/cms/documents/london-streets-performance-report-q1-2012-13.pdf

&gt; Tfl: Average traffic speeds are less than 20 mph in London. Transport for London's latest figures state that for the first quarter of 2011/2012 the average traffic speed on major London roads for the 12 hours between 7am to 7pm was 19.33 mph and over the same period was 8.98 mph across Central London

http://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/news/804876.london_cars_move_no_faster_than_chickens/

It's not bicycles slowing drivers down, quite the opposite.

&gt;Just fluff the interview.  Some would consider it cheating, but I can't really see it that way when the system does everything possible to make you fail.

Wouldn't they notify the Job Centre of that?


&gt;However, there is an awful lot of ""I don't want"" in your post.  A lot of us have to take jobs we don't particularly want while looking for something better.

I'm already applying for jobs — and have attended interviews with the express purpose of getting the job — outside of what I do and paid well below what i have experience in. It's not that I'm not willing, it's the fact they make you sign on the dotted line for something you know absolutely nothing about. 

Is it unreasonable to not be expected to commit to something you know nothing about? Once I commit, I effectively *have to* attend the interview and have to accept the job if I'm picked for it. The job could be 10 hours a week at minimum wage — which means it would be even worse than the dole. Maybe it's just me but I think it's reasonable to have information about the job before you commit to it. That's what everyone else does when they apply for a job.

&gt;You seem to think finding a job isn't all that hard, so find a part time job.  You don't have to want it; it will very probably pay **more** than the Jobcentre and will **absolutely, certainly** consume less of your time, so you can actually look for work effectively without them breathing down your neck.

I am, honestly. I applied for a phone repair shop job that was 20 hours a week. I am willing to work part time or full time as long as it's viable. I just don't want to be worse off than I am now.

MtDNA is in an organelle called the Mitochondria, which are in all of our cells, and are nick named ""the power house"" as they produce the stuff we use for energy. The MtDNA is not really known what it does (last time I was at school anyway) apart from apparently cause some genetic diseases. 

The MtDNA is not part of the 23 chromosome pairs within the nucleus. When a sperm and egg meet, these mix as you (I assume) know. HOWEVER - the mitochondria (therefore MtDNA) is already in the egg - there for it is always passed down maternally. You will always have the same MtDNA as your mother but not father. 


So I guess, yes, you could have a gay couple which would have to have 3 people's DNA (mix of 23 chromosomes from the Male parents, and the donated egg will already contain the MtDNA. )

Something that I do think is especially important to a zonal system is an aggressive keeper who will really attack the ball in the air, because in a zonal system the keeper has a zone to cover as well.  Mignolet really struggles with that, which makes our set piece marking struggle.  Lapses in concentration (most notably from Johnson, Skrtel, Moreno, and Gerrard at various points this season) can also be really rough as they can warp the whole shape of the setup and create massive space where there shouldn't be any.

Do you still think I'm being obtuse about this ;)  My point is that too many people love to blame someone else for a problem that they are complicit in.

Everyone really should accept that when someone looks at someone else, they will see things that are frivolous, which to the person in question might be essential.  We are like that.  In my own situation, the costs of doing the work I was engaged in were simply too high, having such a tax take away such a part of the upside for me, simply made me not want to bother.  The net benefit to me, was not enough for the sacrifices I was making.

So when you see an issue such as this, a vulnerable person committing suicide, I find it bizarre that people are jumping to try and lay blame on people who are not any more responsible, than they are.

What is even more funny, is that things which are not up for debate, such as /u/TheAnimus couldn't be bothered to do a very demanding work because he didn't get enough money compared to more relaxed work proved to be so unpopular that they get heavily downvoted by a few people.  I often wonder that some people have this odd, cognitive dissonance about such matters, they want to label the emotional burden of the shitty nature of life.  It could all be so easily explained by them, maybe a dunning kruger effect going on, if only we'd let them run it, it would be perfect, prima facie account that goes against their beliefs are to be discarded.

Referee details are supplied by the tenant. It's simply a matter of sending an email to the referee and perhaps chasing it up if they don't reply. Worse case the agent would have to go back to the tenant and request an alternative. I imagine that usually the referee is a former landlord.

Credit checks are something I used to have to do as part of my job. Takes less than 5 mins and cost then about £30 for an Experian check. (That was 15 years ago).

It sounds like less than an hour's work.

This ""admin fee"" seems then to be mostly a simple transfer of cost from landlord to tenant. If, say, a letting agent wants £800 for a let they can offer the landlord the service for £300 and make up £500 by charging the tenant an excessive admin fee.

null,false,Ian56,null,null,null,"When the entire British Establishment starts scare mongering about what Scottish Independence might mean - it should be time for most rational people to ask why.

All of the main political parties (except the SNP and the other pro devolution parties) all of the mainstream media and the big banks ran a major disinformation campaign.

The massive disinformation campaign worked.

The more risk averse older population of Scotland voted No to Scottish Independence and the younger people voted Yes.

Older people tend to get more of their information from the mainstream papers and TV.

While younger people tend to get more of their information from the net - where a much broader range of opinions is available.

A lot of questions went unanswered - at least I don't know the answer to them. Some of them:-

How would the oil revenues be split between Scotland and the rest of the UK?

How would the National Debt be split between Scotland and the rest of the UK?

How would the massive liabilities of the banks headquartered in Scotland be split between Scotland and the rest of the UK?

Did anyone do any studies of how many UK government jobs would be relocated from Scotland to England and Wales on Scottish Independence? There is a high proportion of Scots currently employed by the government.

What would happen to the UK's nuclear submarine base? I believe the SNP are in favor of closing it. Where would Westminster relocate it to?

How would the UK's Air Force training be relocated from Scotland? What about other military bases in Scotland?

Is Scotland self sufficient / net deficit / net positive in electricity generation? There's a substantial amount of nuclear and other power generated in Scotland.

How would Scotland ever become independent if they still used the British Pound and were thus dependent on the Bank of England and the government in Westminster for the value of the currency?

The EU said that Scotland would have to re-apply for EU membership and they wouldn't be accepted if they still used Sterling as their currency. What would happen?

That will do for starters - if anyone can answer them.

It seems that the SNP will just have to wait awhile until some old people die off and some younger people reach 18 and get the vote. Then they can hold another referendum (and hopefully be better prepared for the Establishment onslaught that is bound to happen again on any further Referendum vote).

The SNP would also have to do something to reduce the multiple instances of election fraud (on behalf of the British Establishment) reported in the recent Scottish Referendum.",null,0,null,1423072372,null,0,1423072811,0,cob340c,null,t3_2undvp,null,t1_cob340c,null,t3_2undvp,null,null,null,1424195947,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Experienced players are better coming off the bench in my opinion.  They are more likely to accept psychologically the role of a squad player as they accept that their body isn't quite up to full the 90 min every week.  And they have the accumulated experience of most of their career to maintain their confidence in spite of being on the bench.

Don't get me wrong.  Every player is affected by not getting regular minutes.  Very young inexperienced players are much more affected by it on average IMO.  And I know every player is different.  But look at Balotelli and Borini for example. Both in my opinion have a lot of quality, but both are young, inexperienced and have many, many reasons to feel insecure at a big club like Liverpool when they aren't getting minutes.  And the results we are getting out of them speak for themselves.

null,false,oatcrunchie,null,null,null,"&gt; if I go out and buy a macbook air from an Apple store in England tomorrow how many years is Apple required to replace failed parts that were not caused by accidental damage? 1, 2 or 6?

That's not how it works.

The law allows you the theoretical right to seek redress for a period of six years, but the provisions are limited depending on what the item is and what would reasonably constitute as ""fit for purpose"".

It does depend on the fault, what the item is, how long you have had it for and how long it could reasonably be expected to last.

So, to go with your actual question (and bearing in mind that Apple is a premium brand, selling premium products that hold their value very well over time):

&gt; Year 1 ( within 12 months of purchase): The hard drive fails:

I'd be pushing for an outright replacement at the very least - it's completely unreasonable for a hard drive to fail within 12 months of purchase and that is in itself indicative of a manufacturing fault.

It would erode my confidence in the whole product if they only replaced the hard drive and I'd push for a replacement of the whole laptop.

&gt; Year 2: the screen fails 23 months from date of purchase:

So long as it wasn't physical damage or misuse, it's entirely reasonable for Apple to replace the screen - laptop screens should not die within 23 months of purchase and that's well within the life of any laptop.

&gt; Year 4: The hard drive fails (48 months) and as a bonus the charger has stopped working properly, you have to hold it at a certain angle for it to charge at all:

At four years you're possibly onto plums at this point, as Apple will claim that both faults are caused by wear and tear.

You may have recourse if you could prove that there was a manufacturing fault that was present from the day you purchased the unit, but you would be hard pushed.

I'd say you have more chance of them replacing the hard drive after four years than you do the charger, as four years would probably just be within the expected life of a laptop whereas the charger would be subject to normal wear and tear from being moved and reconnected all the time.

&gt; Year 6: the screen fails (71 months):

Good luck that that.",null,0,null,1423073618,null,0,false,0,cob3vlb,null,t3_2uroin,null,t1_cob3vlb,null,t1_cob398v,null,null,null,1424195222,null,12,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,12,null

To give but two examples there are around 80 derivative contracts for every barrel of oil that is physically traded in world trade. There are around 100 derivative contracts on Gold for every ounce of physical Gold physically traded in world markets.

There are also multiple cases of market rigging by the big banks - LIBOR rate, FX, commodity prices, aluminum and food price fixing by Goldman Sachs, derivatives mis selling to pension funds and municipal bond holders in the US, the sub prime mortgage fiasco and ""securitization"", the fraud carried out by Goldman Sachs in conjunction with the Greek government to grossly misrepresent the state of Greek finances that allowed Greece to join the Eurozone, money laundering of drugs cartel cash - see HSBC, money laundering of terrorist and drugs cash (just about all the big banks) etc. etc. etc.

Dabbling?

The City of London and the big banks that operate out of it, own the UK government - it has been that way for hundreds of years. It was made far worse during the Blair/Brown years. Cameron has done nothing to reverse it.

N.B. HSBC initially made their money out of the opium trade with China - the British government started a war over that, when the Chinese tried to fight back against the drug smuggling and the levels of Chinese opium addiction.

You should do some research on how the global financial, monetary and banking systems work and how the big banks make their money. Vince Cable is certainly not going to tell you.

&gt;___Foyle's War___ is a British [detective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detective_fiction) drama television series set during and shortly after the [Second World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War), created by screenwriter and author [Anthony Horowitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Horowitz) and commissioned by [ITV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_(TV_network\)) after the long-running series *[Inspector Morse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspector_Morse_(TV_series\))* came to an end in 2000. It has been broadcast on ITV since 2002. Simon Shaps, then ITV's director of programmes, cancelled *Foyle's War* in 2007, but numerous complaints and positive public demand prompted the next ITV director, Peter Fincham, to revive *Foyle's War* after successful ratings in series five, which aired in 2008.

You can appeal against things (very low chance of succeeding), you can try and change advisors and try cite some kind of relationship breakdown between you and your advisor / coach. 

Unfortunately its all down to these targets they have. I'm on the Work Programme and it is very much the same. The courses they offer are aimed at someone who has 0 education (akin to leaving school @ 15). 

I got put on an IT course that was so ridiculously low level in comparison to my current ability, and I mentioned throughout all of this that it was not relevant to me. The only reason I managed to get out of it, was because the course actually had an entrance exam and I got 39/40 (should have been 40/40 but the marker didn't like my troll answer of duckduckgo being a search engine) 

Throughout the entire event I asked them to give me something relevant and they said they deemed this relevant. Only the exam got me off. This only served to anger them though. In response what they did was find a course that was lower level than that and had no entrance exam. (Some customer service course)

I came in with qualifications from my degree proving I had done modules in this at a much higher level (5 times the level infact) and that wasn't acceptable. It had to be a certificate with the course title on it. This was going to be a 6 week course, with 20 hours of study each week. I ended up getting sanctioned for 3 months for that. I appealed it and the job centre held that it was acceptable. (note if you get sanctioned, you still have to sign on like usual - you just dont get paid for 3 months. If you sign off, then your sanction gets put on hold until you sign back on.)

null,false,DreadyJames,lfc68,,null,"Yeah sure, I don't mean a supporter is from Liverpool - I don't mean that at all, we can't decide where we're born can we? 

A good way of describing what I think the difference between a follower and a supporter is, is by using my two friends' as examples. 

One of them is the Man U 'fan', okay he occasionally watches their games, he'll speak to me about the league table, weekend results - he generally knows how United are doing. *He follows them*

When he loses - he shrugs it off, he gets on with his weekend, he carries on with whatever it is he's doing.
He actually told me he has to place a bet on United in order to make the game more exciting for him.

I don't know if this is healthy or not - but I don't really care, I can't help it - but when Liverpool lose it genuinely ruins my weekend. When I miss a game (like against West Ham, I had to follow it via Reddit) I feel like there's something missing in my weekend. I missed Sturridge come on and tell the world he's back. I missed Sterling and Coutinho light the pitch on fire. I missed it, and I was fucking disappointed.

When we play those traditional Liverpool games where we have all the possession and all the chances and all the intensity and yet we can't finish it and in the final 20minutes we're so tired we throw it and lose the game - it puts me in a bad mood, I won't be quite the same to people, I'm not as happy - clearly. It affects me. Liverpool affects me. 

I'm not aggressive, I'm not nasty, but it upsets me - Liverpool affects me.

So a follower keeps up to date but they don't REALLY care when they lose, yeah he's miffed but he's over it. 

Even when he wins he's not got that passion that thrills the inside of you - you have that glee of joy and your weekend is that tad bit better because we got the victory. He doesn't have that. He'll text me or tell me about how United won. I have another friend like that, this time with Chelsea - it doesn't bother him too much when they lose, but he's going to sure love telling me they've won the league this year if it happens. He'll talk about that for sure.

I was living in Nottingham at the end of last season, now I'm back in Liverpool but when the final part of the season came I was planning on making the trip to Liverpool purely to be a part of the city when we won the league, it would have been absolutely magical. 

Another note of difference is specifics - sure a follower can chat about the weekend results and some news about their team - but he can't talk about United legends like I can discuss the King's move to Liverpool in 1977. Shankly's foundations or Paisleys European dominance. 

I'm not saying to be a true fan you must know your club history bla bla bla, I'm just saying there are a lot more factors into calling yourself a fan.

I don't believe geography plays a part though - I've got Irish and American friends who are a lot more passionate about Liverpool, like me, than my Scouse buds.

If you feel Liverpool in your heart, if it makes your day or week that bit shit when you lose, if you feel that joy and excitement deep inside of you when we pull those wins together, then you are a Red.

Me and my partner Mike have completed the game Doctor Who: The Adventure Games, and we recorded it all. We thought that a lot of Whovians probably haven't even heard about this game, so we then thought to share it here.

Doctor Who: The Adventure Games is an episodically styled game developed by Sumo Digital, published by BBC Wales Interactive, and the first episode was released in June 2010, and the last episode October 2011.

Now, the game is not good. Terrible as a game, actually. It all looks and feels unfinished, especially the last episode (The Gunpowder Plot) which felt really rushed. While the characters do quite look like their real life counterpart, the rest of the game looks like it was developed 2005. Some rather bad controls as well.

You run around interacting with things, solving puzzles in the enviroment.  You do have an inventory, but it's rarely used. There is some puzzles in form of mini-games, and they're pretty bland and uncreative. There's also some stealth sections, which can be pretty frustrating, since the field of vision on the enemies on some parts are just unfair, and they can also shoot through walls. Oh, and you have Amy with you as well, and if they see her, they shoot you instead and you die, even if they haven't even seen you. #logic

This game has some redeeming qualities though. It gets hilarious, due to the glitches and bugs, and the lack of enthusiasm in the voice acting makes it funny as well, especially in the more tense parts (well, it was supposed to be tense anyway) of the game.

All through the game you can pick up collectible cards that features things from the Doctor Who universe, such as enemies, friends, and companions, to name a few. There's also some objects that you can interact with so you get some facts, both taken from the real universe and the Doctor Who universe.

This game will be interesting to the whovians. If you're not a whovian, hopefully our commentary will counter it up.

Luckily for her, the Doctor has a deep regard for her -- she was busy saving his life over and over in 7, and though he's not playing ""boyfriend"" any more the two of them also have the very strong, deep bonds you make when you do brave things under enemy fire together, save each other's lives, etc.  The question, for me, wasn't ""How could she do that to him?!"" but ""How can he forgive her and just get on with doing what she needs him to do?""

More interesting and Relevant is the Sale of Goods Act, which among other things states products must be fit for purpose.

Generally speaking, within the first 6 months if your product fails you return it to the retailer (not the manufacturer) who must then repair, replace or refund your product. After 6 months you may need to prove there was an inherent fault at manufacture or as a result of normal usage.

Many retailers fob you off and send you to the manufacturers, they are failing to meet their obligations under the Sale of Goods Act. Demanding to see the manager and reminding them of this is easier than going to the small claims court. If a repair is carried out, you should allow reasonable time for this to happen. If a refund is offered after say 9 months, they can deduct some money for the 9 months useage you have had of the product. The product will have a reasonable lifespan as well, don't expect to get anywhere returning a 10 year old kettle that suddenly stopped working etc.

I wouldn't mind but this is my experience from the coalition, nhs cut backs meant they wouldn't give my wife who's schizophrenic the treatment she's had in the past which had worked (ect) due to cost so she had 2 years of random drug testing instead.


she couldn't be omitted into hospital because they had no beds due to the cutbacks removing 14 of the 26 beds locally, so I was given choice of go to work and likely find her dead when I come back or leave work (they could only visit her for 30 mins a day)

So due to this we was forced to give up our home because the housing benefit didn't cover our mortgage, we went into temp housing for 3 months.


9 months after applying for pip she was interviewed by ATOS and awarded the highest grade. It is now 4 months later and ATOS want to know why she's still on ESA, in those 4 months the job centre have tried to get her into a job three times through dubious tactics, and telling her that she will lose her benefits if she didn't come to the ""optional"" Saturday workshop.

**UK plans to sell off historic government buildings**

Kate Allen

Plans to sell off a swath of historic government buildings to property developers mean civil servants will be moving from Whitehall — Britain’s seat of government for centuries — to London suburbs such as Croydon.

For the past 12 years, governments have tried to save money by moving departments wholesale to cheaper parts of the country.

In a change of policy, civil servants will be expected to commute to sites in cheaper locations such as Hastings, Reading and Stratford; they will work remotely using iPads and laptops, and meetings will be held on Skype, said Francis Maude, the Cabinet Office minister, on Wednesday.

“There will be some [staff] moves, but you should not expect to see large moves [any more],” he said.

A government review in 2003 recommended that 20,000 civil servants be moved to the regions.

However, the relocation policy has not always been popular: the Office for National Statistics lost skilled and experienced staff when it moved from the capital to Newport in Wales in 2007.

Staffing cuts — the civil service has lost more than 20 per cent of its employees in the past five years — mean the government is “concerned less with where they are located regionally and more with optimising our use of property as we downsize”, Mr Maude said.

National pay scales for government employees mean that cost savings from large-scale relocations are “limited”, while city centre property in Britain’s big cities “is cheaper than central London, but not that much cheaper than outer London”, he added.

Taxpayers must spend about £35,000 a year on office costs for a civil servant based in Whitehall, against just £3,000 a year in Croydon, the Cabinet Office said. In 2010, the government had 143 buildings in central London; that has fallen to 71 and under the latest plans will drop to 23 by 2020.

Last year’s sale of the Old War Office signalled the new government approach; it will be turned into luxury flats and a hotel.

“[The Old War Office] needs a lot of work and we don’t need it, so why not let someone else have access to it?” Mr Maude said.

The Cabinet Office plans to assess the market value of all departmental buildings, with a view to selling those that will raise the most cash.

So far £1.4bn has been raised from sales of central government property, with £625m savings on annual running costs. This could rise to £6bn by 2020.

Two sites have recently been put up for sale — the former civil service training centre at Sunningdale Park in Berkshire where the 1973 Northern Irish Sunningdale power-sharing agreement was signed, and Blythe House, a museum archive in Kensington, west London.

Bruce Mann, director of the Government Property Unit, said: “If there’s something really valuable then [we will] ask what utility we get out of it.”

Transport for London last week announced plans to go into partnership with developers to raise cash from its landholdings over a longer period, but Mr Maude said this was not appropriate for central government. Instead, asset sales would raise cash quickly.

The plans will be implemented over the coming five years, depending on the outcome of the general election in May. Many government IT contracts are due to end in the next three or four years, which will enable departments to switch staff to newer technology that enables remote working, Mr Maude said.",null,0,null,1423076855,null,0,false,0,cob5tld,null,t3_2us6zk,null,t1_cob5tld,null,t3_2us6zk,null,null,null,1424193360,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

&gt; Not any more.

GDP per capitia is still down from is peak, as are real wages and the employment rate - things that actually affect peoples lives.

&gt;&gt; so for now we need to spend enough

&gt; And you are going to find the money for this how?

Borrowing until the economy has fully recovered, and actually taxing the rich at a decent rate. For all the time Thatcher was in power taxation never fell below 40% of GDP, and for most of the time she kept the top rate of income tax at 60%. We've cut taxes so much for the rich we can't afford to look after the poor, it's time we started making them pay their way again.

&gt;&gt; to make sure people aren't killing themselves

&gt; Government spending will never eliminate suicide.

No but we can avoid cuts so cruel that they force people into it.

&gt;&gt; the government is supposed to have a responsibility to the people during a recession not just sit back and watch them suffer

&gt; The recession ended before the 2010 general election, so this isn't applicable to the current government.

On paper perhaps, for most people it hasn't, as I pointed out wages have not recovered for those in work, the employment rate is down, benefits payments are down (in real terms), people are poorer.

&gt;&gt; cutting spending during a recession is also counterproductive as it makes it worse.

&gt; At no point was spending cut during the recession.

Fine, but it was cut before we had recovered to pre-recession levels, cutting during the recovery is just as bad, that's why we've had several quarters of negative growth and the recovery, such that there has been one, has been the worst for over 300 years.",null,0,null,1423077994,null,0,false,0,cob6i4u,null,t3_2uqri4,null,t1_cob6i4u,null,t1_cob5vc6,null,null,null,1424192715,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

As for his lack of a reaction, I'd like to ask what sort of reaction you'd want to see from him? Sadly, cars don't come with a ""sorry mate, I screwed up"" light that they can flash. By the time you hit your horn, he'd already committed to the lane change, so there were limited options to what he could do.

1. Bail out of the change. Multiple problems with that. Firstly, he was already braking as he switched lanes in anticipation for the roundabout. Switching back could have put him in greater danger from behind. Secondly, from his perspective once he became aware of your presence, he had no idea what you were going to do. You could have dropped back to give him room, accelerated past him so he could tuck in behind you, or held your position and not given him room to change lanes. That puts him at risk of being in the wrong lane on the roundabout which is also dangerous. 

2. Brake harder. Sometimes in a panic, the reaction is to stop and reset. In this case, braking harder would have put you in even more danger as he would have not only cut you up, but then suddenly slowed down and forced you to brake hard or swerve sharply to avoid hitting him. 

3. Keep going. You've seen him and made him aware of your presence. It also looks like you braked which gave him a little more room to complete the maneuver. 

Logically, once you hit the horn, the safest course of action was for him to carry on and complete the manoeuvre. He could have flashed his hazards as a thank you/sorry, but given the environment and his obvious difficulty with situational awareness, I'd personally feel safer if he kept both hands on the wheel instead of fumbling to find the button for hazard lights. 

Sure, he made a shit call when he committed to a bad manoeuvre, but the ""lack of reaction"" that pissed you off was the best thing he could have done.
